When the 1996 NFL schedule came out in May , Fox-TV figured it had the game of the year on Oct. 27 : Cowboys-Dolphins . Jerry-Jimmy . Aikman-Marino. // It 's still a nice game , but Rupert Murdoch did n't pay almost $1.6 billion in 1993 to televise nice games . Nate Newton , that Southern philosopher who doubles as the Cowboys ' left guard , put the game in perspective on Sunday , after the Cowboys had expended another of their nine lives in a 32-28 win over the Falcons . " We 're 4-3 , the Dolphins are 4-3 , " he said . " What 's so gigantic about two 4-3 teams playing ? Right now we 're two wild-card teams . " Even that 's a stretch . // Miami 's three losses have come in the last four games ; the Cowboys are still underwhelming the opposition , particularly on offense . Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson , divorced from the Cowboys and owner Jerry Jones in March 1994 , has n't taken any shots at his former boss in months , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aikman was the league 's 11th-rated passer , on the league 's 25th-rated offense ; for his part , Miami 's Dan Marino is expected to start against the Cowboys after sitting out the last three games with a fractured right ankle . // Five months ago who would have thought the first Jerry-Jimmy Bowl would be such a low-key affair ? These guys used to go out of their way to knock each other when they were on the same team , but they zipped lips after their games on Sunday . Following the Dolphins ' 35-28 loss to the Eagles , Johnson refused to discuss the impending showdown . Maybe he was miffed about the four touchdown passes that Philadelphia wideout Irving Fryar caught against his former team . ( An unrestricted free agent , Fryar signed with the Eagles in the off-season . ) Or perhaps it was the 173 yards rushing that Eagles back Ricky Watters piled up . Meanwhile , Jones , after a peculiar day at Texas Stadium , ducked all interviews for the first time in memory . // It 's not unusual to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncannily positioned in camera range as he glad-hands players . However , he made an early appearance against the Falcons . After Aikman was creamed on a play in the first half , a victim of poor blocking from the left side of his line , Jones had a word with coach Barry Switzer . Then Jones walked over to Aikman and said , " We 're going to try to get you some blocking help on that side . " In the third quarter Jones helped restrain Cowboys wideout Michael Irvin from venturing onto the field while yelling at the team 's defense . Jones even toweled himself off at one point . Said linebacker Darrin Smith , " Jerry was just very intense , very excited . " // Kind of like Johnson used to be on the same sideline . Maybe in his new role Jones can give his team some oomph. // Give It Up , Mike // In the wake of the long-anticipated firing of Bengals coach Dave Shula on Monday , the organization 's next step should be to hire an experienced pro football executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans should n't hold their breath . // Even before Shula was dismissed , Bengals president and general manager Mike Brown sounded like a man who was prepared to stay the course . " I do n't plan to change , " said Brown , the pilot of the franchise since the 1991 death of his father , football legend Paul Brown . " I plan to run this team the way we have run it . There are up and down years in this business , and I firmly believe we 'll come out of it . " // Down years , yes . But a down decade ? With their 28-21 loss to the 49ers on Sunday , the Bengals , at 31-72 , have the NFL 's worst record this decade , even after winning the AFC Central in 1990 . Interim coach Bruce Coslet , who served as offensive coordinator under Shula , inherits a 1-6 team whose problems can largely be traced to an offense that ranks 26th in the league . But there 's more to the coaching change than that . To trigger construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50,000 season tickets , including 40,000 personal-seat licenses ; 80 luxury boxes ; and 6,000 club seats by April 30 . If this massive sales effort fails , Brown may consider a move 235 miles northeast . Cleveland , after all , is the city his father put on the football map . // In the meantime , the best move Brown could make would be to surrender his G.M. duties . Ken Herock , vice president of player personnel with the Falcons , might be available at season 's end ; former Browns player personnel director Mike Lombardi is also available . // Brown thinks much of scouting is duplication of work done by leaguewide scouting services . Also , because coaches must work with the collegians the organization signs , he believes it 's an advantage to have the coaches double as scouts . But he would do well to rethink his system and hire an experienced scouting staff to lighten the load on his coaches . // Stats of the Week // ? The Jaguars outgained the Rams 538 yards to 204 , had a 36-8 advantage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more than 41 minutes . They also lost , 17-14. // ? Despite a nagging groin injury , 49ers quarterback Steve Young outrushed his running backs 45 yards to 33 in rallying the 49ers over the Bengals. // Dispatches // The resignation of Saints coach Jim Mora , announced only hours after Shula 's dismissal , made for an unusual day . Until Monday , in the past five years only one coach  --  the Oilers ' Jack Pardee in 1994  --  was replaced during the season . Mora 's downfall ? He stubbornly stuck with offensive coordinator Carl Smith .... // Remember the gloom in Carolina last month after the Panthers lost rookie back Tim Biakabutuka for the season with a knee injury ? Understandable , because stand-in Anthony Johnson had n't had a 100-yard rushing game since his senior year in high school , in 1985 . In the three games since Biakabutuka went down , Johnson has rushed for 102 , 126 and 123 yards . // The End Zone Dolphins wideout Fred Barnett caught two passes for 27 yards against the Eagles on Sunday , 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee .
