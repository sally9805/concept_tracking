It is known as the Great Annihilator : a mysterious region close to the center of the Milky Way galaxy that spews out bursts of high-energy gamma rays . A popular theory held that the Great Annihilator was actually a gigantic black hole , a million stars collapsed into a single object so dense that its gravity would n't let even light escape . New information gathered by the Very Large Array radio telescope in New Mexico and published in Nature has found that this theory is slightly off the mark . The Great Annihilator does indeed seem to be a black hole , but it 's only as massive as a single star , and it 's merely close to , but not right at , the center of the Milky Way . <P> An important part of the theory , however , still seems valid . It holds that as additional gas falls into the black hole , it is compressed and heated . This process creates positrons , one form of the strange stuff known as antimatter ; as the positrons are flung out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : enormous explosions . <P> Every subatomic particle has a corresponding antiparticle , identical in mass but differing in one crucial characteristic , like electric charge . Positrons , which carry a positive charge , are the antiparticles of electrons , which are negative . Matter and antimatter destroy each other whenever they meet , and because interstellar clouds are full of electrons , these particular collisions have been fingered as the power behind the Great Annihilator . <P> Black holes are thought to be rather common in the galaxy , so why has only one Great Annihilator been found ? The answer may be that the galactic core is ! unusually full of gas clouds ; these provide lots of matter for the antimatter to run into . Other parts of the galaxy are just too empty for black holes to create much of a bang .
