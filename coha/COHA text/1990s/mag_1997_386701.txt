When you start a phone call by blurting out a cheery " Congratualtions ! " you run the high risk of being mistaken for one of those irritating telemarketers who calls at dinner time You also stand a good chance of the person at the 6ther end just as cheerfully hanging up on you . Even so , we opted for the enthusiastic greeting approach and started dialing up the winners of our second annual " Be A Gear Tester Contest . " The first winner who was actually home , Josh Stephenson , did n't hang up and was downright overjoyed , to say the least . In fact , after several yelps of glee and a roaring , " Awwwright ! " or two , we made sure he understood that he had n't won the lottery jackpot , that his prize was to schlep fully loaded packs up and down mountains . Then we hung up and proceeded to pass a similar good word on to the other two lucky winners . After several tries we reached them , too , and explained the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit enough to hump some serious loads at altitude , and you have to be prepared for any weather . " Fine , they said . " Show up at the airport and we 'll take care of the rest . " It was all coming together like a well-crafted puzzle . Two months later . Mid-September . The six of us-three still-excited contest winners and ou : editorial trio-were standing in the trailhead parking lot of Wyoming 's Dickinson Park ir the Wind River Range . As the autumn sun shown down on us , everyone 's attention was suddenly diverted to the imposing pile of packs on the ground . Reality hit home ; they'c traveled all this way to hike long distances with a lot of weight on their backs . Undaunted , our tribe launched into the test . ( You 'll find excerpts from our equipment editor 's trip journal scattered throughout this story . ) Being novices to the testing scene , someone asked the obvious question as we prepared to leave the trailhead : " How do you pick the packs ? " Photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake in the Wind River Range , Wyoming . // There are literally hundreds of models out there suitable for a five- to eightday trip , so here is the criteria we used to get it down to six packs : Stated cubic inch capacity of 5,400 to 6,100 ( men 's size large ) , which is generally the size you 'd want for a five- to eight-day trip . Internal frames only . New or significantly changed for 1997 . Weighs less than 8 pounds . Unique features , such as Delrin hoops or new pocket configurations , also figured into the equation . The chosen packs also have other similarities . For instance , each is basically a two-compartment sack with a top-loading upper compartment that closes with a drawcord and is covered by a pocketed lid , and a zipaccess sleeping bag compartment at the bottom . ( The one exception is the Osprey Spectre , which is a single-compartment sack ) . This is the most basic pack design , but one that has proven simple , functional , and durable over the long haul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether it be the rather standard 500-denier " Kodra " on the JanSport or the high-tech 420-denier " Diamond Shield " of the Lowe . Although there are significant differences in the tear and tensile strength of different nylons , in reality most packs wear out at the seams . This means the quality of the stitching ( space between stitches , type of thread , seam taping , and bartacking ) is generally more indicative of a pack 's durability than the fabric itself . All six packs in this test use YKK coil zippers of varying sizes for their pockets ( the bigger the better ) ; all use the standard molded plastic buckles , ladderlocks , and sliders . ( Note that siderelease buckles , popular and convenient as they may be , are much more prone to failure than the simple slider . ) And all have the obligatory and useful side-panel compression straps . Our test team was composed of two women and three men covering a wide variety of sizes and skill levels . ( See " They Strained . They Froze . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear testers . ) Even so , after evaluating all the criteria while humping loads at altitude through wind , sleet , and snow , we discovered amazing solidarity in our opinions and observations . One or two packs were unanimously loved , one or two were basically hated , and several were simply unremarkable . All six testers agreed that comfort and fit are the most important considerations . Said Gwen , " Comfort is number 1 because if the pack makes me miserable , I do n't care about the other features . " The reviews below are arranged according to how they fared , starting with the strongest finisher. 1 . Dana Design 10th Anniversary Terraplane If , as most backpackers profess , comfort is the critical issue , then the Terraplane takes top honors . As its appellation denotes , some version of the Terraplane has been around for a while . In that time it has proven to be a workhorse for backpackers , mountain climbers , and winter campers alike . Kristin put it this way : " I felt at peace with this pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it rode well . " Tom said simply , " Very comfortable pack , snug fit , no friction . " I personally found the Terraplane a " fine , clean fit . " And since the bag comes in five sizes ( XS , S , M , L , XL ) , the shoulder straps in four sizes ( S , M , L , XL ) , the hipbelt in S , M , L for women , S , M , L , XL for men ( and in S and M for slim woman and M for slim men ) - whew ! - you should be able to get a fit no matter if you 're a midget or a monster . The other outstanding characteristic of the Terraplane is its durability . Like all its Dana Design cousins , it 's as tough and persevering as a Scottish mountaineer . Even among a group of extremely wellmade packs , the Terraplane stood out as sinewy and stalwart , easily outscoring its competitors . In terms of accouterments , the Terraplane is the opposite of L.L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacious : one large lid pocket and two big vertical pockets . The pockets run the full length of the main compartment , and thus are partially and awkwardly covered hy the lid when the pack is cinched down . The top compartment also has two long side-zips that provide quick access to a windbreaker or fleece jacket . On the negative side , there were superfluous compression straps at the bottom of the pack , which made cinching the load unnecessarily complicated . The Terraplane is also heavy- second heaviest of the lot . Photograph Each tester wore every pack with loads ranging from 30 to 80 pounds . Above , left to right : Eureka Endeavor , Lowe Crossbow , L.L. Bean Mountain Guide , janSport Rockies . Below , left to right : Osprey Spectre , Dana Design 10th Anniversary Terraplane. // Overall , the Terraplane proved to be our favorite pack by a meaningful marsin . But vou nav for it . It 's almost $100 more than the L.L. Bean Guide . its closest competitor , and an astonishing three times more than the humble JanSport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my credit history , I do n't think I 'll qualify for the loan to buy it . " 2. ( tied ) JaSport Rockies The Rockies was the sleeper of the test . The least expensive pack in the bunch at $160 , it nonetheless outperformed many of its hoitytoity rivals . Starting with comfort , this is what losh had to say : " There is no substitute for comfort , and as far as I 'm concerned , this pack did the trick . " He gave it the highest possible score , a " 5 . " I also found the pack comfy , writing in my field notebook that the " shoulder straps and hipbelt ai n't slick , sleek , or even attractive , but they appear to perform just fine . " Kristin said the Rockies felt " pretty darn good , even though it 's too big for me . " Like the Eureka Endeavor , the Rockies only comes in two sizes , medium and tall , so if you 're on the small side , you 'll probably want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torso length . Everyone was taken by the number and size of pockets . " I liked this setup-a long zippered lid pocket and three nice-size vertical pockets on the outside . It 's not too much , but just enough space , " said Chart Notes Numerical Rating Scale Photograph Photograph // RATED : Midsize Packs // 1 Poor , miserable ; 2 Fair , OK , but ... ; 3 Good , decent gear ; 4 Very good , beats most ; 5 Excellent , superior gear . Note : A " 3 " denotes accept able performance , but not outstanding . Capacity : The first number is BACKER 's measured capacity using our own " ping-pong ball method . " The second number was provided by the manufacturer . Most manufacturers use the " pinto bean method , " which provides very optimistic numbers because the beans stretch out the fabric and fill every iota of space . Numbers represent unextended capacities . Weight : Measurement of men 's large size backpack , weighed in pounds and ounces . The first number is the weight on BP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Testers were asked to numerically rate and comment extensively on the following criteria : Loading : How difficult or easy was it to cram gear in , then dig it back out ? Think about : ease of organization ( with pockets and compartments ) ; access to loaded gear through zips and flaps ; security of items lashed under top lid or onto pack bag ; ability to compress smaller loads evenly . Ease of suspension adjustment : Did the suspension adjustment require tools , owner 's manual , and a factory-trained mechanic , or could it be done by normal humans on the trail ? Did adjusting the pack 's suspension draw blood , inflict pain , rip fingernails , or cause you to swear like a truck driver ? How adjustable is this pack ? Did you max or min out any of the adjustments ? Comfort : Comment on unusual abilities to ease the burden or inflict pain , specifically in these three areas : the shoulders , back/lumbar , and hips/waist . Load control : How does this pack affect your freedom of movement on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rough and steep trails , or backcountry bushwhacking ? Consider things like pack balance ( did it cause or prevent any memorable face plants ? ) , arm-swinging and high-stepping freedom , and head clearance for ogling upward at an eagle . Durability : Did anything actually bend , rip , unravel , or fall off ? What are your predictions on this pack 's long-term life span ? Look at materials , stitching , zippers , attachments , buckles , etc . Overall impression : All things considered , is this a good pack or not ? What did you like most ? What did you like least ? Having tried this pack and knowing the price , would you buy it ? Kristin . " Organization was easy , " said Josh and Gwen . The sleeping bag compartment was also admired because of its large , easy-toget-into horseshoe zipper . Said Josh , " It 's even easy to cram in a gigantic synthetic sleeping bag like mine . " Photograph // This was also the lightest pack in the test , which everyone appreciated . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the load weight was more than 50 pounds . As with the Eureka , everyone disliked the fact that the lid is sewn on and not attached with adjustable straps . Finally , the stitching could be tighter in many places , and more of the seams could be finished for better reinforcement . Nonetheless , the JanSport was a very real and welcome surprise . It 's a solid , functional , thoughtfully designed pack at a fantastic price . If your wallet is thin but your mountain aspirations high , this is the best value of the lot . 2. ( tied ) L.L. Bean Mountain Guide " Holy compartments , Batman ! " That was Josh 's first reaction to the Guide . In terms of organizational capability , no other pack came close . Excluding the two main compartments , the Guide has nine pockets and three detachable zippered mesh pouches . As Kristin said , this pack is for " neat freaks and organizers , " the kind of people who fold their underwear and iron their jeans . Even Gwen , a pocket protectortype engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little things to fill all these pockets , you may be suffering from the dreaded backpacking disease " gadgetitis . " Although sold by Bean , the Guide is designed and built by Gregory . Thus , like almost all Gregory packs , it has a stiff PVC framesheet , carbon fiber stays , and solid , high-density foam in the hipbelt , shoulder straps , and down the length of the back . There is no question the Guide is outstandingly sturdy and capable of carrying more than you ever could , but does it do so comfortably ? The Guide was unusual in this regard because its comfort rating was gender dependent . Kristin and Gwen found it comfortable , both commenting on how the hipbelt cants inward at the top , creating a snug fit around the hips . " Gregory has also softened the foam compared to previous Floform packs , " said Kristin . " Even with sore hipbones from the previous day 's monster load , the Guide 's hipbelt felt OK . " This was not , however , the consensus among the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plastic framesheet , far too rigid , and the lumbar pad too fat and hard . Male and female testers alike remarked about how the shoulder straps lay flat and felt smooth . Because the foam on the straps is attached via Velcro , we all noted how easy it was to tailor the shoulder suspension to one 's own humps and hollows . Still , in terms of overall comfort , the Guide scored higher with women than men . The Guide comes in four sizes ( XS , S , M , L ) , but the adjustability within each size is limited , so make sure you get the proper size to start . The Guide won high marks for durability and workmanship , although a few testers wondered about the statistical chances of a zipper failing , given there are nine . And everyone groaned about the Guides excessive weight ( almost 8 pounds ) . Still , Gwen rated the Guide as her favorite pack , and it 's safe to say that it was the most female-friendly of the bunch . 3 . Osprey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.L. Bean Guide with scores that were largely gender dependent . Again , Kristin and Gwen gave the Spectre high marks for comfort . " Under medium load conditions , " said Gwen , " the Spectre seemed to hug my back perfectly , magically contouring to lower , mid , and upper back . " ( Gwen did not find that this held true , however , when the pack was heavily loaded . ) Kristin said , " Everything about the suspension system seemed to fit just right . All the padding is well-shaped and soft , yet supportive . " Now compare those comments with the men 's . Said Josh , " I could n't get this pack to feel comfortable no matter what I did . " Or Tom 's lackluster , " For all my carping , I guess it was comfortabe . " This is n't the first time I 've heard women praise an Osprey pack and men demur . One clue might be that Osprey packs in general , and the Spectre in particular , tend to run small . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , Gwen and Kristin liked the single large compartment ( the only one in our test ) , and the men deplored it . Josh gave the Spectre a " 1 " in the loading department ; Tom was only slightly more generous , giving it a " 2 . " The single sack does reduce the weight of the pack ( Osprey bills the Spectre as its " superlight " model ) , but it still was n't the lightest pack in our test . There was , however , one attribute that garnered unanimous enmity , and that 's the " Vector . " Similar to the pocketed shove-it flap on the Eureka , the Vector is a roadkill-shaped , nylon-covered foam panel . The pack 's compression straps attach to each corner of the Vector panel , hence it operates essentially like a lid strapped to the back of your pack . Interestingly , whereas several testers liked this concept when the shove-it panel had pockets , sans pockets , everyone found the whole system maddening . Said Tom , echoing Thoreau , " Simplify , simplify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And that Vector thing was next to worthless . " Luckily , there was also one attribute that generated universal praise : workmanship . Constructed from lightweight but super tough " Spectra cloth , " the Spectre is built to last . In fact , the soles of your boots will most likely wear out quicker than the soul of this pack . 4 . Eureka Endeavor In terms of points , this pack fell right in the middle , which is telling , given that it is substantially less expensive than four out of the six packs tested . Almost everyone gave the Endeavor a thumbs-up on comfort , although two of us could n't find a satisfactory position for the shoulder straps . The hipbelt was clunky and bulky , but still seemed to do the job . In terms of design , the Endeavor is one of two test packs ( the other being the Osprey Spectre ) that has a " shoveit " flap on the outside of the packbag . But unlike the Osprey " Vector " panel , Eureka 's shove-it flap has handy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket , " from its origins as a place to stow your avalanche shovel on winter packs , the " shove-it " is now a fairly common feature . The compression straps are always attached to this semi-free-floating turtle shell , so you ca n't remove it ( if you do n't like it ) without losing all load stability adjustment . For that reason , and because of their general floppiness , people either love or hate shove-it panels . Josh was one of those who loved it : " Great for holding a windbreaker or fleece jacket . " Tom said the pockets on the shove-it were perfect containers for all those necessary " get-at-ables . " I appreciated the convenient half-moon zips on the pockets , but would have preferred the pockets sewn to the sack rather than the flap . Unfortunately , the Endeavor comes in only two sizes , medium and large . Although each size offers a reasonable degree of adjustment , this pack is tough to tailor to smaller torsos . Several testers also found the stability of the load suspect when bushwhacking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack were used and admired , although they were often useless when the pack was fully loaded . The zipper on the lid pocket was simply too small , though , and the lid itself is sewn directly to the pack and thereby not extendible to accommodate large loads . The pocket seams are not taped , so durability could become an issue . Still , when price was mixed in with the other criteria , the Endeavor was generally praised . Said Gwen , " It would be a great pack for someone who will subject it to light or moderate use , or a person on a budget . " Josh concurred , putting it succinctly : " Great beginner 's pack . " 5 . Lowe Alpine Crossbow If the JanSport Rockies delivered this test 's biggest surprise , the Lowe Crossbow brought its biggest letdown . On first impression , we really wanted to like this pack . Its impeccable stitching , lustrous diamond-ripstop fabric , and shapely suspension raised high expectations . Lowe says the external Delrin " Crossbow " hoop supports the load and focuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hold-open bars common to external frame packs ) seems like a great idea . And for some people , this may hold true . But during testing , the trail miles told a different tale . Josh was the only tester who really liked this pack , and comments from the rest of us tell the majority story . Tom : " Too long and narrow , bad external pockets . " Gwen : " More and more uncomfortable as the day wore on . " Why all the negativity for a sturdy sack made by the inventors of the internal frame backpack ? Take a close look . First , the suspension system seems overpadded . That 's right , there 's too much of what is normally a good thing . The lumbar pad protruded into the small of most testers backsides . The fat shoulder straps tended to roll up on edge despite much fiddling with yoke adjustments and the upper stabilizers . No one , not even Josh , could get the shoulder straps to feel comfortable . Note : Since our test , Lowe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field feedback indicates some improvement , though the straps remain bulkier than some users may like . Second , the Crossbow hoop did n't appear to work any better than conventional compression straps . In fact , the hoop proved somewhat of a nuisane . The stiff plastic rods obstructed loading large items into the main compartment , and the hoop 's retaining tunnels ( sort of like the pole sleeves on a tent ) took up space where you 'd usually lash odd-size gear to the outside . More importantly , the hoop also seems to distort the sides of the hipbelt , causing gaps at the back . Third , the two vertical back-panel pockets are so small they 're of limited use ; they wo n't readily accept a oneliter water bottle . Suffice it to say that Lowe has built many beautifully functional packs , but the first-generation Crossbow needs work before it 's up to the standards set bv its ancestors . All Thing Considered So where do all these quotes , comments , and chart numbers leave you , if all you want is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get to the store and check them all out for yourself , but here are our humble recommendations : If you 're one of the lucky folks for whom money is no object and you expect to use your pack hard for many years to come , get the Dana lOth Anniversary Terraplane . If you 're not ready for such an investment and your torso is about 18 inches or longer , buy the JanSport Rockies . It 's a good , functional , comfortable pack for the money , but only for larger folks . Smaller hikers , particularly women , should consider the Osprey Spectre or the L.L. Bean Mountain Guide . // RESOURCES // <p>
