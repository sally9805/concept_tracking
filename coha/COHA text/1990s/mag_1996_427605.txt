Section : Society They were perfect teens . Then she got pregnant , they got scared  --  and the baby ended up dead . <p> AMY GROSSBERG WENT INTO labor just after midnight . She was in her freshman dorm room at the University of Delaware , in pain and terrified . She could n't go to the hospital . Only 18 , she had spent the last nine months hiding her pregnancy from her well-to-do parents , perhaps afraid to shatter their suburb- perfect image of their lovely , artistic daughter . So she called the baby 's father , Brian Peterson Jr. , also 18 , at his college in Gettysburg , Pa . He arrived three hours later in his black Toyota Celica , took her to a nearby Comfort Inn motel and paid $52 for Room 220 . What happened next is equal parts mystery and tragedy . Police say a healthy baby boy  --  20 inches long ; 6 pounds , 2 ounces  --  was born toward morning . Brian told the authorities that he put the child in a plastic bag and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their colleges  --  stopping at a carwash , perhaps to clean up the Celica 's interior  --  and hoped that their gilded , carefree lives would go on as if nothing had happened . But something had . The next day , police say , they found the infant  --  shaken to death and with his skull and brain crushed . Amy and Brian were charged with murder . If they 're convicted , the Delaware attorney general says she will ask for the death penalty . <p> Such grisly crimes are n't entirely uncommon . Last week a cleaning woman at a movie theater in New York 's Long Island found an hours-old boy asphyxiated in a toilet . FBI statistics show that 207 children younger than a week were murdered in 1994 , a 92 percent increase since 1973 . There is a pattern to these deaths . The parents are usually young and poor ; the mother frequently acts alone . But Grossberg and Peterson do n't fit the profile , which is one reason their families  --  and suburban parents around the country  --  are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable homes . Friends describe them as good ' kids . They had access to abortion clinics , adoption agencies and counseling to handle an unwanted child . They were two wealthy kids who had so many options in life , ' Constantine Maroulis , a Grossberg family friend , told NEWSWEEK . Seeking out an abortion , or putting the baby up for adoption , perhaps seemed too risky to the teens : their families could somehow find out . The fear that this child would cost Grossberg and Peterson their privileged lives  --  and disappoint the people who had made their comfortable worlds possible  --  may have led the too-young parents into a spiral of fatal decisions . <p> They met at Ramapo Regional High School in Franklin Lakes , N.J. , an affluent suburb of golf courses and million-dollar houses 20 miles northwest of New York City . Theirs was a classic teenage courtship  --  the proms , the glowing yearbook photos  --  in a town where everything was above average . She excelled at art and French . He was a jock : captain of the golf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up in new-money suburban manses and drove their own cars ( hers was a white Cherokee ) . Grossberg 's father owns a large furniture business ; her mother is an interior designer . Peterson 's mother and stepfather run a successful video-rental business . Walking the halls at Ramapo , the popular couple seemed an ideal match . It was probably about as serious as a teenage relationship gets , ' Amy Lucibello , who worked for a summer with Grossberg at the Market Basket gourmet-food store , told NEWSWEEK . <p> When they left for college late last summer , Grossberg was six months pregnant . Peterson made the three-hour trip from Gettysburg College to Delaware every other weekend ; she visited him once . Though Grossberg  --  who is just over five feet tall and wears size-1 pants  --  somehow managed to hide her pregnancy from friends and family at home , she made no secret of her condition at school . She wore tight shirts  --  she did n't hide it , ' says Seth Chorba , 18 , who lived on the same floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of respected her privacy . ' Students who met them at both schools say Grossberg and Peterson seemed perfectly well adjusted . There are no reports of missed classes or other signs of stress . The only potential trouble came when Grossberg 's mother , Sonye , said she planned to go to Delaware for homecoming last month . Her daughter told her she 'd be away visiting friends . Perhaps Amy  --  in her eighth month of pregnancy  --  could n't face her . <p> When her water broke in her dorm at about 12:45 a.m. on Nov. 12 , Grossberg apparently was n't sure what was happening . According to police reports , she called Peterson and said her stomach was bothering her and she might be in labor . ' After he picked her up , they drove past several cheap motels along the highway before deciding on the Comfort Inn . They checked in at 3:10 a.m . About an hour later , Grossberg gave birth . Around 5 a.m. , they checked out and returned to her dorm room , where the couple slept for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only evidence left of their ordeal lay wrapped in a gray plastic bag in the Dumpster behind the motel . <p> They almost got away with it . Grossberg 's dormmates did n't notice anything about her demeanor or body that indicated she had given birth . There was really no change . It was the same Amy , ' Chorba says . But later that day , at about 5 p.m. , Grossberg began to complain of stomach pain and slumped to the floor of her dorm . She had turned very pale and blood was seeping into her pants . Her roommate went running down the hall for help . Someone called an ambulance . When Grossberg arrived at Christiana Hospital in Wilmington , doctors discovered that the baby 's placenta had not passed through her uterus during delivery , which caused complications . She finally broke down and told doctors about the motel birth  --  and her boyfriend 's role in disposing of the baby . Police in Delaware and Pennsylvania began to investigate . They found damp and bloody sheets , clothes and sanitary napkins in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also begun to snap . Just hours after returning to his Gettysburg campus , he confided to a student-residence counselor that he had helped his girlfriend give birth and they had gotten rid ' of the child , according to police . Investigators found a bag of bloody sheets in his dorm as well . In his car was a receipt from the White Glove Car Wash stamped with the time 11:28 a.m. , about seven hours after the baby was born . Pennsylvania officials held Peterson on misdemeanor charges of concealing the death of a baby , but they were forced to release him because the alleged crime occurred in another state and they had no evidence to hold him . Peterson promptly disappeared . <p> Meanwhile , police in Delaware had discovered the baby 's corpse . An autopsy completed a few days later showed that he had died of multiple skull fractures , with injury to the brain , blunt-force head trauma and shaking , ' according to the official report . As she was released after five days in the hospital , police arrested Grossberg  --  looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged her with first-degree murder . The Delaware attorney general , M. Jane Brady , announced that because the victim was younger than 14 , the state planned to seek the death penalty against both teens . <p> Facing the prospect of death , Peterson went deeper into hiding . A national manhunt , headed by the FBI , mobilized the media . While the New York tabloids screamed HOW COULD THEY ? , friends and neighbors defended the couple . She was the sweetest girl you ever met . It 's like Barbie getting busted , ' Maroulis said . Peterson 's lawyer , Joseph Hurley , tried to soften his client 's baby-killer image in the face of a potential death sentence by announcing that Peterson was n't fleeing ; he was in seclusion with his mother , Barbara Zuchowski . True , the family had considered secreting him to a country without an extradition treaty with the United States . How can I give my only born child to the state to die ? ' Hurley reported Zuchowski as saying . But with the Feds threatening to step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to turn himself in . <p> The night before surrendering , Peterson and his family moved to an undisclosed hotel in the Wilmington area . The young fugitive spent the evening praying , Hurley said . At 9:30 a.m . Thursday , Hurley , Peterson and his parents drove from the hotel to a Wilmington street corner two blocks from the local FBI office . The blue-eyed teen wore a baseball cap , blue jeans , T shirt  --  the antithesis of a rich boy 's jacket and tie . Worried about death threats , Peterson also sported a bulletproof vest , a loan from the FBI . As the family moved slowly through a mass of about 50 pushing , shouting reporters , Peterson 's mother clung tightly to his arm . She sobbed as someone yelled , Baby killer ! ' As they arrived at the courthouse , she wailed , I want to go with him ! ' Inside , Peterson said just one word  --  yes '  --  as the judge asked him to confirm his name . When asked how his client would plead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the position that he did not murder . ' <p> But the defense is not taking any chances . The teens ' lawyers have hired Dr. Michael Baden , a well-known forensic pathologist who testified for O. J. Simpson at his murder trial , to work as a consultant . One possible argument is that , rather than beating the baby to death , the scared young parents accidentally crushed his skull while trying to deliver their own child . That could still get a manslaughter conviction , but it avoids the death penalty . With a grand jury expected to convene this week , lawyers for both sides say they 're still formulating strategy . They have n't decided whether they will seek separate trials , though Hurley started to point the finger at Grossberg last week . I think her concerns are the major thing that led them to where they ended up , ' he said . She was totally concerned with not letting Mom find out . ' <p> Both sides will no doubt try to appeal to the jury 's sympathies . Were these rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry-free , country-club lives ? Or can their lawyers put their youth and upbringing in a perspective that will explain what they did ? Time after time we see teenagers who do n't fully understand the consequences , ' says James Fox , a juvenile-crime expert at Northeastern University . They understand cognitively that murder is wrong . But emotionally , they 're immature . ' John Daley , 20 , a childhood friend of Peterson 's , says , There 's a lot of pressure in a neighborhood like that , especially with the girls , to be the perfect princess . She must have built up in her mind how terrible it would be if her mother found out , how everybody would look down at her . Image is everything . ' Now Grossberg and Pe- terson must confront something far more terrifying than humiliation : the pros- pect of death row . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Lost youth : Peterson surrenders to the Feds ; Grossberg leaves the hospital <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Unusual suspects : Before their baby 's corpse was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in the New Jersey suburbs <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Brian Peterson <p> BY MARC PEYSER With GREGORY BEALS in Delaware , SUSAN MILLER in New Jersey , ANNE UNDERWOOD in New York , ARLYN TOBIAS GAJILAN in Gettysburg and CLAUDIA KALB in Boston <p>
