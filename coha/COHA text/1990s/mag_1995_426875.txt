Section : World report Rabin 's assassin thought he was on a sacred mission to save Israel . There are others like him . <p> He was among the best and brightest at Bar-Ilan University at Ramat Gan , just outside Tel Aviv . Brilliant in computer sciences , though mediocre in his other major , law , 25-year-old Yigal Amir was known as one of the most dedicated students in the university 's kollel , or adult academy of Jewish studies . He was also one of the most single minded . Together with hundreds of other students , Amir would trek to the bridge just beyond the campus for fist-shaking , epithet-slinging demonstrations against Israel 's withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip . Many protesters would be whipped into a frenzy and would want to block the streets and burn tires . But Amir was n't merely venting spleen . <p> " We have plans . We do things , " explains Noam Federman , an ideological soulmate of the assassin and the spokesman for the extremist , virulently anti-Arab group Kach ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On weekends , the small , wiry Amir would organize Sabbath outings to West Bank settlements , especially in and around Hebron , where politics and religion have come together in combustible opposition to the Mideast peace plan . <p> To fellow student Shmuel Gvir , Amir was even keel  --  not even close to the stereotype of a mad assassin . " Forget the idea that he was crazy . He was a normal guy who carried out an act , " Gvir said . The confessed killer hung out withother students , dated women . Sociable enough , talkative enough , nothing overtly violent about him . He carried a licensed Beretta 9-mm pistol with him on campus , slipping it under his desk because guns had to be put away during study hall . Even this was not unusual : A lot of students had firearms for protection , especially those living in the volatile West Bank or Gaza settlements . Gvir says his classmate saw the government as purely evil . " Everything for him was black and white , and he saw everything logically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had tremendous rhetorical ability . He was extremely persuasive  --  one thing always led to another . " <p> Conspiracy . After the slaying of the prime minister and Amir 's arrest , his older brother Hagai , 27 , was also jailed for allegedly manufacturing the dumdum bullets that killed Rabin . By week 's end , six suspects , including Hagai , had been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy , shattering Amir 's claim that he acted alone . In a statement Friday night , Israel 's minister of police said that this plot , which involved an underground movement , had been hatched with the religious authorization of certain rabbis who had ruled that Rabin 's rightful fate was death . Police are also continuing to investigate Eyal , the radical group of which Amir was a member . A Hebrew acronym for " Jewish Fighting Organization , " Eyal is similar to Kach but has perhaps no more than 10 to 20 members . <p> Amir grew up at 56 Borochov Street in Herzliyya , a city north of Tel Aviv , one of eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class but poor in comparison with much of the rest of the city  --  which was named after Viennese Zionist Theodor Herzl , considered the ideological founder of Israel . Amir 's parents , Geula and Shlomo , were from Yemen , and like most Jewish immigrants from that Arab country , deeply religious . Shlomo writes religious parchments for a living , and Geula runs a nursery school in back of the house . Even with the family 's sudden notoriety , it was a reflection of Geula 's high standing in the community that her students returned as usual after the killing . <p> Amir 's politics were not common knowledge in the neighborhood , where most of the families were not religious , says Dorit Nagar , who lives across the street from the Amirs . " He was a quiet boy , a good boy . When my next-door neighbor was sick and fell out of bed onto the floor , he went over there and helped her back into bed . I never talked to him , just , Shalom . ' The mother used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The father was more quiet , a very good man . Such a wonderful family ; ask anybody around here and they 'll tell you the same thing . " <p> But despite his calm demeanor , Amir saw his world of unshakeable precepts and unalterable truths coming apart , a feeling shared by many ardently religious Jews who believed that the peace process was nothing less than a demonic challenge to divine plan . The West Bank and Gaza belong to the Jews as a biblical commandment and as a precursor to the coming of the Messiah , many religiously Orthodox Jews believe . For Amir , as for others in the restive religious extreme , Rabin was a traitor to Israel , anathema to Jewish destiny . Many right-wing hard-liners  --  religious and nonreligious  --  wanted to see Rabin killed . " I 've heard it so many times , " says Federman . " Not from 100 people and not from 200 people , but many more . People would hint to me that I should do it  --  they seem to think I walk around with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Jew who hands over the property of another Jew to a gentile may be killed by zealots  --  have currency in certain Jewish academies and synagogues , from the West Bank to New York ( box , Page 74 ) . Rabin was seen as " handing over " the Land of Israel , which God promised to Abraham in the Torah 4,000 years ago , to Arabs ( gentiles ) . <p> " He 's not mine . " The family of the assassin was deeply contrite . After police found a cache of explosives hidden in the basement , walls and back yard of the family 's home , his mother , Geula , spoke of her son " Gali " on Israeli television . " He 's not mine anymore . I do n't wish this on any Jewish mother  --  or even on an Arab or a gentile  --  to have to endure what I 'm going through . " <p> Police placed green plastic sheeting in front of Amir 's house to deter curiosity seekers . Onto the sheeting , the family taped an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one sign of inner agitation in her son : He had lost a great deal of weight in the months before the assassination . <p> Amir traveled the well-worn path of many ultraconservative youths . He started elementary school and junior high at state-run religious schools in Herzliyya , then for high school went to a more religious , privately run yeshiva in Tel Aviv . He eventually transferred to a different yeshiva favored by highly observant students , the kind who would later choose Bar-Ilan University . Later he went to Kerem D'Yavneh , a yeshiva that the Israeli Army allows religious youths to attend as part of their three-year mandatory military service . For his Army stint , Amir served in the elite Golani Brigade combat unit . <p> Bar-Ilan Prof. Uriel Simon , one of the leaders of Israel 's religious peace movement , notes that most religious public schools and yeshivas espouse a brand of religious nationalism . " The holiness of Eretz Yisrael Land of Israel is held above every other value , especially that of democracy , which is seen as a Westernor Hellenistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amir 's ruthless interpretation of those beliefs . And in the aftermath of the assassination , many such schools sought to underscore this crucial difference . At Bar-Ilan , where Amir was a third-year student , memorial candles to Rabin burned in the cafeteria as students gathered to sing the " Song of Peace " that Rabin sang at a peace rally just before his death . <p> What finally set Amir so dramatically apart was that he pulled the trigger . Though there was a strong conservative tendency at Bar-Ilan , only about 20 students identified with the extreme right , said Gvir , who is also vice president of the student council . Political activity is officially banned on campus , but extremists would hang antigovernment posters anyway . It would take a while for them to be taken down . <p> " Very determined . " Rabbi Moshe Raziel , head of Amir 's kollel , says he ca n't stop turning over in his mind how and why the assassination occurred . Amir was " very determined about expressing his views , " Raziel recalled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he did , he would speak at length . He held his ground , even when the other students disagreed with him . He could not accept opposing views . " When Amir studied with Raziel , they concentrated on the Talmud , which is a guide for daily living based on the laws of the Torah . " Nobody studied harder than Yigal , " he said . " When most of the other students would go home in the afternoon , he would stay on for hours for further study . I liked him because he was a good student , but he never discussed politics in the institute . " <p> Amir evoked his religious training after his arrest . When he was brought to court in Tel Aviv , Judge Dan Arbel asked him , " Have you ever heard of the Ten Commandments ? " Amir answered back , in a scornful voice : " It 's sad if that 's your whole knowledge of the Torah . No one abolished the Ten Commandments . There is an admonition more important than , Thou shalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls . ' If someone goes to kill your friend , you are dutybound to kill that person first . " Clearly , Amir saw Rabin as a murderer of Jewish people . <p> Rabbi Raziel has ruminated long and hard on how Amir could read the Talmud and other holy books and come up with a justification for murder , when all but a very few rabbis  --  even fire and brimstone ones  --  see it as an abomination . He offers this unsettling explanation from Jewish civil and religious law : " It says in the Talmud that for the person who studies it in the right spirit , the Torah is an elixir of life . But for the person who studies it in the wrong spirit , the Torah is an elixir of death . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Accomplice ? Hagai Amir , the assassin 's brother <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Assassin .

The right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derfner <p> American sympathizers WHERE THE KILLER IS A HERO <p> " Hello , you have reached the Yigal Amir Defense Line , " begins the grim recorded voice on the Manhattan telephone line . " Yigal Amir is a young religious Jewish hero who assassinated the evil Rabin . " <p> A man calling himself a volunteer for the defense line  --  an effort to raise funds for the confessed assassin 's legal defense  --  is even more explicit about Yitzhak Rabin 's murder . " We felt that this whole incident saved hundreds of thousands of Jewish lives , " says Moshe Gross , 28 , of Brooklyn . " It was equivalent to somebody killing Adolf Hitler before the Holocaust . " <p> Small but determined Jewish splinter groups in the United States have long been among the most ardent supporters of Israeli extremists  --  and despite the shocking murder of Rabin , that backing is likely to continue . Gross says his support line received 100 calls by midmorning during its first day of operation . <p> Act of the Almighty . In a press release , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Board of Rabbi's-Vaad Harabanim of America , called Rabin 's killing " an act of the Almighty for his blasphemy of dealing with the master murderer terrorist Yasser Arafat and giving land promised to the Jewish people away to a terrorist organization . " <p> Such extreme views , however , are rare , even in places where Rabin 's peacemaking with the Palestinians rankled many politically conservative Jews  --  such as Brooklyn 's neighborhoods of Boro Park and Midwood , where stores have names like Jerusalem II Pizza and Kosher Delight . <p> " Even though we may disagree with the decisions that Rabin has made recently , " says Neely Bernstein , an insurance broker , " nobody can say that this man did not devote his entire life to his country .
