Section : Adjusting <p> Oh , I think your wife is just wonderful ! " I have lost track of the number of times that I have heard this particular comment , or some variation thereof , in the years that I have been married . The sight of my wife wheeling down the road with a baby balanced on her lap and two older children running alongside is enough to call forth superlatives from most people . <p> And it is not that I disagree . I happen to think she is wonderful too . I will admit that there are times , such as when we 've just had a **25;0;TOOLONG , when I do n't particularly want to hear what a magnificent person my wife is . <p> It does annoy me people are so amazed that Joyce is capable of taking care of three children , not to mention an occasionally cantankerous husband . It annoys me because I know where they are coming from , having been there myself . The idea that a disabled person can have sexuality , can get married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that order ) , comes as a shock to most people . Certainly , I was no exception . <p> My wife is wonderful , by the way . Motherhood is one of the toughest jobs around and being a paraplegic does not make it any easier . That she can do all that is required of a mother and also baby sit for other children , be a Le Leche League Leader , counsel other disabled mothers , and do a great deal of miscellaneous volunteer work , is to my mind nothing short of amazing . So , no matter how tired I may be of hearing " Gee , is n't your wife wonderful , " I ca n't help feeling a little proud of her too . <p> And I can use some positive strokes . There is a certain amount of annoyance involved with being the only able-bodied adult in the family . I can not count the number of times I have lifted a wheelchair into and out of the trunk of the car . Nor can I count the number of times that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an unfeeling pair of wheels . <p> But I consider myself pretty lucky . I walked into this with my eyes wide open . My wife was disabled when I met her , and thus I got all the necessary adjustments over with right from the beginning . If my wife had become disabled after we married it would have been much harder . <p> The way I see it , there are three kinds of people who deal with disabilities . One group has to do so because they have no choice : this group mainly consists of disabled people themselves . Others , such as doctors , physical therapists and attendants , deal with disabilities because they are paid to do so ( most of the time there is sometimes more to it than just money . ) But there are only a very few people who get the opportunity to voluntarily accept a portion of the burden of disability . I think I 'm fortunate to be in that group . <p> I am more involved with the parenting of my children . When we were trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had to get up ( after a little prodding from my wife ) , and walk the baby . ( After all , my wife had the equipment to feed the baby and I had the equipment to walk the baby . ) <p> Our children take everything in stride . Our babies quickly learn to balance , unsupported , on my wife 's lap , or to climb up unto her lap by themselves when they need food or support . They have also learned how menacing she looks when she comes wheeling down on them with wrath in her eye because they 've done something wrong . She can not hold their hands crossing the street , but when she says , " Hang on to mommy 's wheelchair , " there is seldom need to look down to see if they are indeed holding on . <p> There have been moments of terror in our lives , such as when our son ran through a plate glass door . I was applying pressure to a scalp wound and my wife could n't drive us to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wound long enough to get her chair into the car ( some friendly neighbors took us ) . <p> There have been amusing moments . Such as when our youngest child was in the process of arriving , we told the anxious nurse at the emergency room not to fetch a wheelchair , " Do n't bother , we brought our own . " <p> There have been irritating moments . Such as the time a lay minister , after meeting my wife , took me aside and said , " Do n't worry , you 'll get your reward in the next life . " I just nodded and suppressed the urge to punch him out . <p> There have also been moments of great joy . When no one else was around , I gave my wife a piggy back ride up the tallest slide at the playground so she could slide down . I felt an awareness of my place in the world , of being needed . It was akin to the way I felt when I saw my children being born . <p> I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's like being married to a woman who is paralyzed . I already have my response prepared : " I do n't know . I 've never been married to someone who was n't .
