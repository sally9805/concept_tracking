Creepy , menacing music sounds in the background as a picture of the White House flashes on the screen . Footage of Bill Clinton talking about his religious convictions is interspersed with head-shot stills of the President sneering or laughing uproariously . When Paula Jones appears to tell her story about sexual harassment by the Governor of Arkansas , she is dressed in a little-girl costume and speaks in a high-pitched voice , both presumably to suggest chaste innocence . <P> Such ham-handed tricks might make the widely publicized videotape called The Clinton Chronicles laughable  --  if it were not so vicious . It repeats , with little or no evidence , virtually every accusation ever made against Bill or Hillary Rodham Clinton and adds some new ones . At one point , a narrator declares flatly that as Governor , " Clinton was hooked on cocaine . " That 's all : no further details , no evidence , no corroboration . Worse still , an Arkansan named Gary Parks comes onscreen to voice suspicion that Clinton ordered the murder of Parks ' father , without pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people might have noticed the videotape  --  let alone bought it for $20 a copy  --  if it had not been for its high-profile endorser or an earlier , shorter and rougher version called Bill Clinton 's Circle of Power . Both were produced by a California organization calling itself Citizens for Honest Government . The Rev. Jerry Falwell duplicated the earlier Circle tape , and in May offered it to viewers of his cable-TV program Old Time Gospel Hour . ( No one will give any figures on sales of either video . ) Illinois Congressman Philip Crane , who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1980 , wrote a complimentary covering letter for + copies of the longer Chronicles tape , distributed by the California group to his G.O.P. colleagues on Capitol Hill . <P> Both tapes heavily feature Larry Nichols , a former Arkansas state employee who was fired and filed a lawsuit against Clinton and others that was dismissed from both Arkansas and federal courts . Since then he has been telling anti-Clinton stories to anyone who will listen . In March he asserted that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges that Governor Clinton , through a state agency , provided money-laundering services for a cocaine-smuggling ring that operated out of an airstrip in the little town of Mena , Arkansas . <P> TIME in 1992 investigated these allegations about Clinton and concluded that they were simply untrue . Even Nichols was unsure then ; he told TIME in an interview the same year , " I have no knowledge about Mena . " On the videotapes , however , he asserts that he went to Mena to look around and saw drugs being loaded and unloaded openly  --  at a time that he does not specify , but that must have been earlier than his " no knowledge " statement to this magazine . <P> All of which seems to embarrass even Falwell and Crane . They now stress that they are not saying that all or any of the allegations made on the tapes are true  --  merely that , in Crane 's words , they form " the basis of an investigation . " So why was Falwell actually selling a tape making accusations that he can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoting the Bible , might be tempted to remind Falwell of the Eighth Commandment : " Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
