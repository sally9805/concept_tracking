ALL THE RAGE IN ARGENTINA <P> If the movie Evita bombs , it wo n't be for lack of publicity . Not a frame has been shot , yet the film has generated the sort of controversy that surrounds a sighting of the ( other ) Madonna . Buenos Aires ' walls are decorated with slogans supporting either MS . PERON , inset , or MS . CICCONE , who appears , at left , in an exclusive , official portrait as Argentina 's once and future , if unofficial , queen . Madonna , who has already recorded the score , plus one song written for the film , is sufficiently inured to the buzz to appear in public , albeit under guard . But even President Carlos Menem has weighed in : " I do n't see Madonna in the role . I do n't think Argentina 's people , who see Evita as a true martyr , will tolerate it . " But director Alan Parker is unperturbed . " There 's an extreme minority faction who have an opinion about what we 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would show him the film when I 've finished . I think he 'll be pleasantly surprised . " <P> SEEN &; HEARD <P> So many lawsuits have been filed against Anna Nicole Smith that the nonwaif model and millionaire 's widow has declared bankruptcy . She filed for Chapter 11 in order to focus her finances on winning a share of the estate of her late husband . <P> Tom Waits , who has n't given a concert since 1992 , has been inspired to return to the stage by the plight of Don Hyde , who owns a hip movie theater and concert venue north of San Francisco . Hyde has been indicted on drug charges in Kentucky  --  unfairly , Waits believes  --  and revenue from the sold-out event will help pay for his defense . <P> EVERYTHING BUT THE ' TUDE <P> For BEN WATT of Everything but the Girl , the winningly unprepossessing British duo whose single Missing is nudging Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston in the singles charts , success is fun but not essential . " It 's thrilling to have a pop hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to our life as an underground band . " Not surprising , since he and TRACEY THORN have been recording since 1982 . In 1992 , when Watt nearly died of Churg-Strauss syndrome , an autoimmune disease that can affect the lungs and intestines , they reassessed everything . One result : Missing . Now the album 's moving too , but Watt can cope : " The up-and-down nature of success keeps you sane . " <P> I , MAYTE , TAKE YOU ... <P> Perhaps figuring that Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley 's split has left a gap in the market for odd matches , PRINCE has settled on a lifetime mate . The artist , formerly known as avidly polygynous , will marry MAYTE ( pronounced my-tay ) GARCIA , a Puerto Rican  --  born belly dancer and singer who has been a member of his backup group since 1992 . The happy nuptials will take place in Paris on Valentine 's Day , to the strains of Kamasutra , a symphony Prince has commissioned from his band , the New Power Generation . Further details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will wear higher heels than the mercurial musician at the ceremony  --  are scant , but all will be revealed on Prince 's Website , to be launched on the wedding day .
