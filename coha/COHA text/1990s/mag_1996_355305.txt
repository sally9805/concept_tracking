So much to do , so little time . The 100-m dash is at once the shortest foot race in the Olympics , the longest running and the most fabled . It has belonged to Harold Abrahams , Jesse Owens , Bob Hayes , Carl Lewis , Wilma Rudolph and Flo-Jo , not to mention a man named Stella . Ever since Antwerp in 1920 , when Charley Paddock gulped down a raw egg in a glass of sherry and defeated five rivals with a time of 10.8 sec. , the winner has been declared " the world 's fastest human . " Basically , the race is 10 sec. that last a lifetime . Adding to its allure for the 1996 Centennial Games is the convergence of time and distance : 100 years , 100 meters . What 's more , Atlanta seems to have been handed two 100th-anniversary gifts from the Greek gods in the form of a matching set of tantalizing his-and-hers 100s . <P> The very first race in the 1896 Athens Olympics was a preliminary heat of the 100 . The eventual winner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who after winning the final in 12.0 sec. went on to become a lawyer and a journalist ; he was also the official starter for the first Boston Marathon in 1897 . Americans have long dominated the event , winning 14 of 22 Olympic 100s , finishing one-two seven times and sweeping the medals twice . Interestingly enough , three of the first seven winners acquired law degrees , including Abrahams , the Brit whose 1924 race against anti-Semitism was chronicled in the film Chariots of Fire . <P> The greatest track athlete of all time , of course , was Jesse Owens . The son of Alabama sharecroppers , Owens said his secret was , " I let my feet spend as little time on the ground as possible . " In Berlin in ' 36 he began his assault on Hitler 's Aryan-superiority theory with his victory in the 100 , the first of his four gold medals . African Americans would in fact win all but three Olympic 100s from 1932 to 1968 . The blessing of modern professionalism is that runners can keep running ; Owens had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 64 and ' 68 winners , Bob Hayes and Jim Hines , turned to pro football for their livelihood . <P> The first of Carl Lewis ' eight gold medals came in the 100 in the ' 84 Los Angeles Games . When his father died in 1987 , Lewis placed that medal in his coffin and said , " I want you to have this because it was your favorite event . " Seeing his mother 's surprise , Lewis said , " Do n't worry , I 'll get another one . " He did , but only as a consequence of the greatest scandal in Olympic history : the 1988 100 m . Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson , whose motto was " When the gun goes off , the race is over , " flashed across the finish line in Seoul in a world-record time of 9.79 sec . Unfortunately , when his urine test came in , it was all over for Johnson . Lewis , the second-place finisher , was awarded the gold .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
