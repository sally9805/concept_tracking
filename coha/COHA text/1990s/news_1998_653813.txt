<p> This spring , Suguru Takamatsu , one of 814 new employees of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company , took his destiny into his own hands . <p> Mr. Takamatsu , 25 , declined to join the ranks of the Japanese salarymen who rarely think about financing their retirement until their employer hands them a fat check at the age of 60 . Instead , he elected to have his retirement benefits , along with other perks the company would normally provide over the course of his career , paid to him directly as he advances at Matsushita . <p> The budding engineer plans to invest them on his own , taking advantage of the new opportunities promised by financial deregulation . " There is no guarantee that I 'll keep my job at Matsushita until I retire , " Mr. Takamatsu said . " There might be layoffs , or I might change my mind , find a better job or better conditions . " <p> Listen closely . Mr. Takamatsu 's choice  --  and Matsushita 's decision to let him make it  --  may seem like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cracking of the iron links that have traditionally chained Japanese employee to employer for life . <p> " We want to give more opportunities to our employees to select their course , " said Atsushi Murayama , managing director of personnel and general affairs at Matsushita , the electronics titan that markets products under the Panasonic and National names . " We accept that some will seek work later outside the company , but that 's the reality of the changes in Japanese business and in Japanese society . " <p> For the first time , Matsushita  --  long considered one of the most conventional big businesses in Japan  --  gave new recruits a choice of three retirement plans , knowing full well that it was striking a blow against an employment system that has been the backbone of the industrial complex that made Japan a global economic power . <p> " I was astonished , not just surprised , " said Hiroyuki Matsui , a manager at the Nikkeiren , the Japan Federation of Employers ' Associations . " The management style of Matsushita is very , very traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so it 's difficult to understand why they have introduced this kind of thing . " <p> With a note of disapproval , he suggested that newly minted college graduates lacked the preparation to make the choices Matsushita was giving them . " It is impossible to judge the success of this program for 20 to 30 years , " he said . <p> But Matsushita is not alone in taking what are bold steps by Japanese standards . Ever so gently , corporate Japan is trying to reduce its reliance on lifetime employment by tinkering with the rigid , seniority-based salary system . While this movement has been going on for a while , it is now picking up momentum . <p> Many companies have introduced management ranks to merit-based pay systems to reduce the relevance of seniority . Fujitsu has gone the furthest , announcing recently that merit would determine the pay of all 47,000 employees in Japan . <p> Some companies are even fiddling with the semiannual " bonus , " a label that implies a link to performance but in Japan refers to a twice-yearly payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started calling the bonuses " lump-sum payments " in hopes that someday it can give real bonuses to employees whose work is exemplary . <p> Amid today 's hard times and rising unemployment , early retirement is becoming more common , if not more publicly acknowledged , and companies are brazenly cutting overtime pay and other benefits . " The Japanese-type management system , such as the seniority system or lifetime employment , can not be continued , " said Isao Nakauchi , chairman , president and chief executive of Japan 's largest retailer , Daiei Inc. , which is grappling with a huge debt and a slowdown in consumption . <p> It 's not that Mr. Nakauchi or any other executive here thinks lifetime employment does not have its place in Japanese industry . Everyone is well aware of the benefits of having a core group of committed employees . " Employment stability is still the biggest obligation an employer has , " Mr. Matsui said . <p> Mr. Murayama of Matsushita agrees  --  to a point . " If we lose that totally , we wo n't have success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those types of people who elect big businesses like Matsushita because they 're looking for a stable , steady , comfortable environment , they make me a little uneasy . " <p> Matsushita , a pillar of Japan Inc. , has been cautiously chipping away at the traditional mold . The salaries of its 11,000 managers are determined by merit , not seniority , and it is negotiating with its union over a similar plan for the rest of its 83,000 employees in Japan . <p> This year , it introduced a performance-based stock option plan for management , and it is seeking a cost-effective way to push the mandatory retirement age to 65 from 60 . With its low birth rate , Japan will eventually face a labor shortage that could be partly addressed by reversing the trend toward early retirement and extending working life  --  seniority-based pay makes older employees too expensive . If birth rates do not increase , the population will plummet from 125 million today to a stunning 55 million by the year 2100 , according to Government forecasts . <p> " We need team spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative , independent thinkers who want to work outside the team , " Mr. Murayama said . " To those people , the uniform pay system is something frustrating , something that gets in the way of human development . " <p> Matsushita 's retirement plan , however , seems to be somewhat of a novelty in Japan . Japan has nothing like a 401(k) program , and the notion of self-directed investment for retirement  --  an idea that has taken hold in the United States  --  is as alien as the thought of wearing shoes in the house . <p> Nonetheless , most Japanese are well aware that they will probably have to pay for a good portion of their retirement themselves because , all things remaining the same , the Government pension fund is likely to run dry in 2025 . <p> As for Matsushita , it is hoping the new program will attract a higher caliber of job applicant . " One of our frustrations has been that we ca n't recruit above-average students so easily , " Mr. Murayama said . " The traditional pay system is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to attract look elsewhere for a job . " <p> The new retirement program gives recruits a choice of three plans . They can , as Mr. Takamatsu did , opt to have pension benefits paid out to them as they go ; they can have a portion paid out and leave a portion under the company 's administration , or they can choose the traditional , lump-sum-on-retirement system . <p> Even in the traditional system , workers normally get a partial payment if they leave a company before retirement , but job switching has been rare , and with lifetime employment the norm , openings scarce . And while Matsushita guarantees a respectable 7.5 percent return on workers ' retirement money , some employees think they can do better . <p> Tomohiko Hasegawa , who graduated from Meiji University this year with a law degree , chose the conventional system . It 's not that Mr. Hasegawa , a 23-year-old lawyer hoping for an international posting with Matsushita in the future , is n't interested in managing his own money . But he figures he can do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have no plans to switch jobs , so why should n't I participate in the company plan , " he said . " I 'm planning to stay for a long time . " Much to Matsushita 's surprise , however , 39 percent of its new employees opted for the nontraditional plans . <p> Many of them were women like Yuka Kitadai , 22 , who often do not view their careers as lifetime endeavors . Ms. Kitadai , who graduated from Keio University , chose the plan that pays her the retirement allowance portion of her total benefits package but allows her to participate in programs for housing loans and other company-sponsored investment options . <p> " I want to be able to use it now , " she said . " I thought I could invest it myself or use it to travel and learn some other languages on my own . " While she 's aware that as a novice to investing , she may lose the money , Ms. Kitadai said she was prepared to take that chance . She does not expect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in case . <p> " One of the reasons I want to start learning another language is because I think I 'm going to have to protect myself with my own skills , " Ms. Kitadai said . " That way even if I got laid off by Matsushita , I could use my skills to find another job . " <p> Ms. Kitadai was among the 31 percent of new employees who opted for " Plan B , " which pays out retirement allowances along with the semiannual bonus but allows participants to invest in various company savings plans at attractive rates , take part in the company 's stock purchase plan and qualify for special loans for their children 's education and scholarships . Under that plan , a new employee who makes less than $1,478 a month would receive $597 a year in retirement pay . <p> " Plan A , " the more radical of the company 's three retirement plans , was selected by 8 percent of new employees , who had to have a specialty like law or engineering to qualify ; such people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They chose to forgo participation in company savings , housing and stock programs in exchange for additional compensation : a new employee earning less than $1,478 a month gets $1,418 a year in advance retirement payments . <p> Like Ms. Kitadai , Shinichi Yamane , a graduate of Ohio State University , opted for Plan B. He liked it because it offered him the chance for some extra cash but also protected a bit of his future by allowing him to participate in various company benefits . <p> " I thought choosing Plan A was a little risky , but I also thought it might be better to get some of the money in my younger years rather than when I 'm too old to enjoy it , " he said . <p> Mr. Yamane , a 28-year-old electrical engineer , will join the semiconductor development division when his initial training is finished . He said he planned to use the additional money that will come with his first bonus on a new stereo , clothes , perhaps even a car . <p> Like Mr. Yamane , Mr. Takamatsu agreed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him considerably , but he was sanguine . " There are no guarantees anymore here , " he said . " I have to take responsibility for my own future . " <p> Chart : " Breaking the Chain " Until recently , Matsushita , like many other large Japanese companies , offered a single benefits package that assumed employees would spend their entire working life at the company . As new employees have become more interested in mobililty , Matsushita is leading the way in Japan by offering greater variety . TRADITIONAL MODEL  --  Workers receive a lump sum when they retire and a bonus twice a year . Other perks are included in a package designed for those who plan to stay for life . PLAN A  --  An employee who has special skills and does n't expect to stay for long can get higher pay and take advances on his pension , but gives up certain benefits . PLAN B  --  Designed for those who want more flexibililty than the traditional plan but less than Model A , it allows early pension payments to be invested in savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Changing Careers " Fewer Japanese workder are expected to stay at one company for their entire lives . Graph shows percentage of Japanese workers who 1 ) are more frequent job changers , 2 ) are specialized workers , 3 ) have traditional lifetime employment .
