It did n't confuse me that the new occupant of apartment 29A was a woman . The Father of Lies is nothing if not inventive . The number 29A is , of course , the Number of the Beast in base 16 , and 16 is the atomic number of Sulfur . Base 16 is commonly called " hex . " It was all too obvious . <p> Celia Strafford looked to be in her early thirties  --  32 , to be precise , since 2 , 3 , and 37 are the prime factors of 666 , and she looked too old to be 23 , and I " m 37 , and she looked younger than me , so ergo , as they say , 32 . I 'm speaking of the age of her body ; I could n't know the age of the creature inside . She wore her long red hair loose down her back . I watched her closely as she stooped to pick up a box to lug up the stairs to her new apartment . She wore cut-off jeans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange golden tan you only see on women . I 've never been able to figure how they achieve that color . She wore no shoes . <p> Her old red Chevy looked right at home among the junkers in the street . Ours is not the nicest street in Las Vegas . <p> " You must be my new neighbor , " I said when I met her on the stairs . " I 'm Palmer Jones I live next door . When you have time , I 'll tell you 476 wonderful things about this place . " My little test  --  476 is the Number in base 12 ; there are n't really any wonderful things about this dump . I just wanted to see what she 'd do with the Number . <p> She shifted her box and poked out a hand for me to shake  --  blood red nails , I noted . Cool , cool skin . Her touch made me tremble . <p> " I 'm Celia . " She gave me a deceptively nice smile , but it did n't fool me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green eyes , I was sure of that , even if my mention of the Number had n't gotten a rise out of her . <p> I already knew her name , too , having sneaked a peek at her lease agreement while ostensibly chatting with our muddleheaded manager about the deplorable conditions of my pipes . Later , I 'd looked up " Strafford " in my Oxford History of Britain , and , sure enough , Thomas Wentworth , the first Earl of Strafford , was listed in the index . A little digging in Johnson 's A History of the English People revealed that Strafford was executed in 1641 , and 1641 is the Number of the Beast base 7 . I do n't believe in coincidences . <p> " So , what do you do , Palmer ? " <p> I hate that question . It always catches me off guard . " I was in the Army , " I muttered . I did n't mention that I am actually Brother Palmer of the Secret Order of Morse . <p> She turned on her perfect smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are probably 820 things worse than being in the Army , " she said . <p> Base 9 . <p> I felt the blood drain from my head . I could tell by the way her green eyes narrowed slightly that she 'd seen my shock . I rushed a big frozen grin onto my face . <p> " Right , " I said . " Right . " I hurried on down the stairs . I 'd been on my way to the corner 7-Eleven to buy a pretense for getting into her apartment later on that evening , after she 'd lugged all her stuff up to 29A . I planned on spending the wait in the park we locals called " Three Trees and a Bench , " across an empty lot and one street over . I had my calculator and my binoculars , and the vantage point would allow me to watch her with no danger of being seen . <p> I would n't change my plans . Even if she 'd recognized me for what I am , it would be a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was a fiery summer afternoon , just the day I 'd most expected Celia Strafford to move in . You see , 666 expressed in base 14 is 358 , and if you subtract 358 from 365 ( the number of days in the year ) you get 7  --  that is , July , the seventh month . Then if you sum the digits of 358 in the Fadic fashion ( 3 + 5 + 8 - 16 ( another sixteen ! ) and 1 + 6 - 7 ) you get the day . Ergo July 7 . Poking out these numbers on my calculator again as I waited for her to finish moving in , I became even more convinced that she belonged to the Army of the Night , the Antichrists . I had been born to stop them . It did n't matter that I might have lost the element of surprise . <p> Right after I 'd been asked to leave the Army , I 'd spent several weeks in the public library in Fayetteville , North Carolina , picking through city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suspected I had found it when I saw the address of my present apartment building on the outskirts of Las Vegas . 10131 FOX Road . The number 10131 is 666 in base 5 , and according to the Pythagorean system of Numerology , FOX also evaluates to 666 . That might not have been enough , but when I got here , I found that apartment 29A also existed , and that clinched it . I knew it was only a matter of time before someone like Celia moved in . <p> Celia had a lot of stuff . All the apartments in our building are furnished , so she did n't have any really big items to move , but it took her all afternoon to unload her rented trailer and lug the boxes up to 29A . I knew that the precise number of boxes would be significant , and I tried to count them , but her red hair distracted me , and the way she moved in her short shorts , bending at the waist to pick up a box , slumping back against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a fantasy in which I chased the demon from her body , and she , quivering with gratitude and relief , came into my arms , and we walked together from this dying neighborhood into a white picket fence family , just the two of us , multiplying , being fruitful . Would n't it be wonderful . <p> I had to slap myself on both sides of the face , hard , to dislodge that dangerous delusion . You 've got to be on your toes when dealing with the damned . You ca n't let a demon with red hair and green eyes make a fool out of you . <p> I looked through my binoculars again , and seeing that she 'd finished , I looked at my watch . It did n't surprise me that it was 5:56 . That , after all , is 666 expressed in base 11 . I gave Celia sixteen minutes to settle in , then hurried back to our building . <p> " Mr. Jones . Palmer , was n't it ? " Celia said , when she answered my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed her the wine I 'd bought at the 7-Eleven . <p> " Come in , come in . How nice . " Celia closed the door behind me . <p> She had a cat , a scrawny orange and white thing , that circled my legs in a figure 8 , all the while giving me a look that said it knew exactly what I was up to . <p> More precisely , the creature was a KITTEN ! <p> Notice that 666 in base 9. is 1010011010 . Those digits can be converted to Morse code by changing the ones to dashes and the zeros to dots . <p> ( underbar ) . ( underbar ) .. ( underbar ) ( underbar ) . ( underbar ) . K I TTE N <p> This conversion of the Number to Morse code was the original inspiration for my founding the Secret Order of Morse . In the tenth century , this insight might have eased the minds of people who worried about the Apocalypse coming at the millennium . My findings show that it could not possibly have happened until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the telegraph and Morse code . Saint Morse was pretty clear in the very first words sent by telegraph : " What hath God wrought ! " He was telling us to finally look out for the Big One . If people before that time had pondered the nonexistence of telegraphy , they could have rested easy  --  a luxury we clearly do not share today . <p> " Sit down , Palmer , " Celia said , pulling me toward a battered , flowered couch . She took the wine from my hand , turned to the tiny kitchen , and then paused at the door to look back at me with a mischievous smile . " I 'll open the wine , but I was just indulging my sweet tooth . Would you like to join me in a piece of cake ? " <p> CAKE ! <p> ( underbar ) . ( underbar ) . . ( underbar ) ( underbar ) . ( underbar ) . C A K E <p> " No thanks , " I said , my voice a little shaky . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cake apparently forgotten , and handed me one . She took the chair in front of me , swept her long red hair back behind one ear and sipped her wine . Deliberately showing me her forehead , I thought . No mark . Must be hidden on her body . I decided to proceed cautiously . <p> " What made you decide on this building. ? " I asked . <p> She just gave me a look , a knowing look , I thought , and grinned . " So , you 're a military man . I 'm a school teacher . " <p> " A school teacher ? " <p> " You want to know how much money I make . " <p> I had the sinking feeling I was losing control of the Examination . " How much money you make. ? " <p> " People always want to know how much teachers make , " she said . " I make 22,122 dollars a year . " <p> " Base 4 , " I said . <p> She grinned an evil grin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Like hunting. ? " <p> " You 've got to be very quiet when you 're trying to get an idea across . You 've got to sneak up on the student and shoot him in the ear with a metaphor . " <p> " Shoot him in the ear ? " <p> She filled our wine glasses again and put the bottle back on the floor by her chair . " Shooting , " she said . " You should know about shooting , Palmer , being in the Army and all . " <p> " I was in the Signal Corps . " <p> " Well , even if I 'm not really moved in yet . " She made a face at the piles of boxes , the clutter . " I 'm still taking off tomorrow to go shooting . " <p> I gulped my wine . I knew the answer to my question , but I had to ask it anyway . Fools rush in . " What kind of gun will you use ? " <p> " A .3030 , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Beast , base 6 . <p> " And where will you go to do this shooting ? " <p> She put her wine glass on the floor and leaned forward , her elbows on her knees , to fix me with her flashing green eyes . " Mojave Desert . South of Death Valley . I 'll be going to Essex . " <p> To Essex ! <p> To Essex ! <p> 2 E 6 ! <p> Base 15 . <p> Here was the demon , strong and calm , cool , toying with me . I might as well have been a mouse quaking before the green eyes of a serpent . A short prayer : Lord , spare me the indignity of wetting my pants . I dropped my glass and leaped to my feet . Her eyes got big , and she jumped up , too . <p> Every time I tried to make the Sign of the Cross at her with my fingers , my mind clouded . My first attempt looked like a T , my left first finger atop my right first finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered what I wanted to do , but not how to do it . When I stopped in confusion to consider my hands , Celia collapsed giggling back into her chair . <p> " You bozo , Palmer , " she said and made a perfect cross with her slender white fingers . A demon could n't do that . Not a demon , which meant that she was a woman , a real woman , a woman with a goofy grin now . " Oh , sit down , Palmer , " she said . <p> I slouched down onto the couch again . <p> " Maybe we 'd better introduce ourselves again , " she said . " I 'm Sister Celia of the Divine Order of Symmetry . We study the perfect forms of the Number . " She held out her hand for me to shake . <p> I next said what I had never said to another human being ; I said , " I 'm Brother Palmer of the Secret Order of Morse . " It felt so good to say it aloud . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mockery in her voice . I heard only genuine interest . I explained the angle I took on the Number . I used some of my favorite examples . <p> For example , I said , " The Number looks a lot more like a series of dots ( those holes in the sixes ) than it does a series of dashes , and as a series of dots it is dot dot dot or S , and S is the symbol for Sulfur , and S is the first letter of the name of you know who . " <p> " Okay , " she said . <p> " And consider 6 spelled out , " I said and took my notepad from my shirt pocket . " Look at what that would be in Morse code . " I wrote on the pad and handed it to her . <p> . . . . . ( underbar ) . . ( underbar ) S IX <p> * * * " I see , " she said . <p> " And with only the most obvious and elementary re-examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following .

( underbar ) H EX <p> " So another way to look at 666 is six six six , and another way to look at six six six is hex hex hex . Everything fits . " <p> She agreed . We found that we agreed on a lot of things . Her kitten came and curled up in my lap . He 'd waited until Celia and I had put all our cards on the table . Cats know these things . <p> We shared what we 'd discovered about the Number . <p> " Look at the Number in base 3 , " she said . By this time she had produced two legal pads and we 'd already filled and tossed yellow sheets all around the couch where we now sat shoulder to shoulder . <p> " The Number is , of course , 220200 in base 3 , " she said . " If you take out the zeros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 3 times 222 is 666 . " <p> " That 's beautiful . " <p> " Yes , " she said . She sighed . " Yes , beautiful . But it does n't really matter now , " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " How many bases has your research involved , Palmer ? " <p> " Sixteen , " I said . " There 's bound to be discoveries above that , but I 'll leave them to future scholars . " <p> " Let me show you something , " she said . " There are three symmetric forms of The Number in the first 16 bases . That is , three palindromes . Make a table of them , please . " <p> I did so . <p> preBase The Number4 2212210 66613 3C3 " Now notice , " she said , " that the forms break naturally into groups of three . Add that to your table .

I looked up at her sunburst clock and saw that it was 12:32  --  the true witching hour , 666 base 8 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . <p> She looked then took my hand and squeezed it . " Make the conversion to base 19 , Palmer . " <p> Okay . We 'd need 19 symbols including the usual symbol for zero . I took the calculator from my shirt pocket . Nineteen squared is 361 , and 666 minus 361 is 305 , and 19 goes into 305 16 times with 1 left over . My result stunned me , and I checked it again . Same result . I checked it once more . <p> " Do n't check it again , Palmer , " she said . " It 's right . " <p> I wrote my result on a fresh page and handed her the legal pad . The Number in base 19 ? It 's 1G1 . <p> " More symmetry . What does it mean , Celia ? " <p> " Write those ls out as letters . " She handed the pad back to me . <p> I wrote : ONE G ONE <p> " And that 's the news , Palmer .

She let the pad slip to the floor , then she covered her face with her hands and leaned against me . I put my arm around her shoulders . <p> " Maybe there 's another meaning , " I said . <p> " No , " she said and pushed up and away from me . " The principles of symmetry are clear . I can show you proof . " She picked up the pad again . " Consider the table again but this time let 's look at the second set of three perfect forms . And this time , let 's add horizontally instead of vertically .
