SYMPOSIUM Arts Education in Early Childhood <p> We are told that in ancient Ireland , poets were above the law of the king . Kings were , after all , as erratic in their wisdom and grace in Ireland as elsewhere . But poets told the stories that gave meaning to fife . I begin and end this brief discussion with the assumption that art is a profoundly human activity , one that gives meaning to our daily lives as human beings . <p> My goal is straightforward  --  to extend the conversation on art in early childhood education . I suggest that we adjust the way we look at both children and art by changing the language we use and , thus , the conversation we have been having . The language I propose comes from an emerging and strongly cultural perspective on the leaming and development of young children . I begin with three introductory and rather abbreviated discussions , which I then , in more elaborate fashion , attempt to synthesize . <p> First , I will argue for the centrality of narrative in human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discuss implications of postPiagetian perspectives . Third , I will explore some underlying themes of the present conversation that limit it . <p> I must caution the reader that I write not as an art theorist nor as an art educator . At times , then , my arguments may betray a lack of knowledge of both areas . For this I apologize in advance . The Centrality of Narrative <p> Jerome Bruner has suggested that narrative is central to human experience . We come into this world with an " innate ' and primitive disposition to narrative . " Soon our culture " equips us with new powers of narration through its tool kit and through the traditions of telling and interpreting in which we soon come to participate . " 1 <p> This disposition to and rapidly developed competence for narration serves us well in what various scholars have argued is the central goal of human experience  --  the construction of meaning , or , put more mundanely , the process of making sense of our daily lives. 2 <p> Let me suggest , then , that art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , art is a crucial cultural tool for making sense of our lives in a given culture . We turn to art , as both listeners to artistic narratives and constructors of them , for meaning . As the philosopher Richard Rorty has reminded us , " The world is out there , but descriptions of the world are not-the world does not speak . Only we do . " 3 <p> Thus people , and germane to this discussion , children , are storytellers . The very telling of stories becomes a profoundly important activity . Through it , we take up the shared task of continual construction and reconstruction of those narratives that help us achieve coherence in our fives , that show us what is probable and possible , or more bluntly , that help us make sense of it all . Exchanging Piagetian Words for Post-Piagetian Ones <p> Piagetian theory has come under increasing criticism in recent years , particularly for its view of stages and egocentrism and for its inattention to children 's competence and to culture . John H. Flavell suggested that " human cognitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high-homogeneity meaning of the term . " 4 Rochel Gelman and Renee Baillargeon were stronger , " There is little evidence to support the idea of major stages in cognitive development of the type described by Piaget . " 5 Kurt W. Fischer noted that " unevenness is the rule in development . " 6 <p> Gelman wondered , " There is so much evidence now coming in about the perspective taking abilities of pre-schoolers ... that I find it hard to understand how I or anyone else ever held the belief that preschoolers are egocentric. " 7 Margaret Donaldson , in her watershed volume , Children 's Minds , 8 showed convincingly that Piaget underestimated children 's cognitive abilities across a number of domains . Bruner went a step further and critiqued the individualism and aculturalism that underlie Western psychology in general : <p> The assumption is that there is some inherently individualistic Self that develops , determined by the universal nature of man , and that it is beyond culture . In some deep sense , this Self is assumed to be ineffable , private. 9 <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young child remains the solitary scientist , " discovering concepts for herself while playing with pebbles on the beach . " " A Post-Piagetian Perspective <p> The vocabulary of stages and egocentrism , of incompetence and acultural individualism , needs to be replaced . Alternatives are available from an important body of work referred to , for want of a better term , as post-Piagetian , a term that reflects both the influence of and the break with Piaget . <p> Core to this perspective is a focus on the cultural and social nature of learning and development . Young children are seen as much more competent than previously supposed , and , most importantly , older children and adults are seen as much less competent than before . <p> Kayoko Inagaki differentiated post-Piagetian perspectives from Piagetian ones along three dimensions . First , do-main-specific restraints are seen as more significant than domain-general ( stage ) restraints in the construction of knowledge . Learning and development occur very differently in different areas or domains . Second , the priority of logico-mathematical structures has been abandoned ; instead , learning becomes easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others have described this as the effect of familiarity-people , including young children , are smarter in familiar situations than in unfamiliar ones , and it is this familiarity or unfamiliarity that will most affect performance . Third , the sociocultural context of development is seen as crucially important. 11 <p> In practice , this means elaborating what children already know , encouraging and helping them to become deeply involved and expert in one or a very few areas , and encouraging children to construct knowledge colleclively through peer interaction . Further , it means supporting or scaffolding children in their learning . <p> Human sense . Donaldson incorporated this perspective into her profoundly simple concept , human sense. 12 All human learning , Donaldson argues , begins with a person 's human sense , that understanding of the world we have constructed through our experience . In order for children to learn , they must be able to relate what they are to learn to their understanding of the world , to their human sense . To the extent that what is presented to them is distant from or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimally available to them . <p> I emphasize that the argument is not one of should  --  that it is better to do it this way  --  but rather an argument of is  --  that which we can not connect to our human sense we can not learn . It remains as if it were presented in a foreign language . Nor is the argument one of building only on children 's interest , a most narrowly romantic and liraiting perspective that John Dewey ably critiqued ninety years ago in the wonderful " The Child and the Curriculum . " 13 Children 's interest , like everything else , needs to be guided and expanded , but the unfamiliar must first be tied to their sense of what the world is , how it works , and their part in the whole process . The Hidden Baggage of Words <p> If it were merely a matter of inserting new vocabulary for old , changing the conversation would be relatively easy . Unfortunately , the Piagetian language in early childhood education was laid over a preexisting conversation and what were , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways an old and very limiting conversation . As Mikhail M. Bakhtin argued , language exists only in usage . " Each word tastes of the context and the contexts in which it has lived its socially charged life ; all words are populated by intentions " of those who have used them before. 14 The words we use carry the baggage of other people 's meanings . <p> The conversation of early childhood education has for a long time been very maturationist , romantic , and idealist . If the Piagetian notions of the young , albeit not very competent , scientist has limited the place of art in early schooling , the underlying themes of maturationism , romanticism , and idealism have done so even more . <p> The maturationism of the early to mid-twentieth century remains subtly strong in our daily talk . As I have argued elsewhere , Piaget 's decidedly nonmaturationist theory is most often expressed in most maturationist terms , becoming simply another way of describing the unfolding of biological readiness. 15 <p> Further , maturationism itself is overlaid on a strongly hereditarian outlook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates because of their genetic makeup , they also become ready for different things . Some children are born with certain skills and tendencies , and others are not . The skills connected with the arts are definitely seen as things with which children , some children , are born . In this language , artists are born , not made . I am suggesting that all human beings are born storytellers , and that both art and artists are socially constructed . <p> The influence of romanticism and idealism have been more subtle , but both have the effect of devaluing human activity and removing art from daily activity . As Rorty explains , the idealist speaks of representing " a hidden reality which lies outside us , " and the romantic of representing " a hidden reality which lies within us. " 16 For the former , reality is the inaccessible world of ideas , a world of perfect forms , endless and unchanging . For the latter , reality lies equally distant , but deeply within rather than without . In both cases , reality is ideal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic and the idealist , art becomes an attempt to describe inaccessible meaning , rather than the act of constructing very visible and human meaning . <p> From the time of Friedrich Froebel , and no doubt before , early childhood education has been deeply romantic . Further , it has been highly idealist . Froebel , G. Stanley Hall , William Torrey Harris , Susan Blow , and Dewey as a young man were committed idealists . <p> What has been the effect of this conversational baggage ? From maturationism came the emphasis on readiness  --  if children are not doing something , it is because they are not ready to do it , that is , because they can not . With this , as I noted above , came a heavily hereditarian cast of mind . The very notion of helping children become artistic , either in terms of understanding or production , became relatively unimportant . <p> For the idealist , art is not a human construction  --  that is , the goal is not to construct meaning , but instead to produce copies of the inaccessible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less a human endeavor than a priestly one . It is not something in which children engage in any but the most marginal way . Romanticism simply adds to the effect of individualism  --  art is not cultural expression , but self-expression of the hidden within . Again , it becomes , in effect , sacred . Children have to learn to express themselves-and in true romantic tradition , if the adult intervenes , the adult simply interferes with and eventually crushes this self-expression , this ability to be in touch with what is most inner . Remember that for Rousseau , it was civilization , the adult world , that eventually corrupts children , changing them from noble savages into unfortunate victims . A Different Way of Talking <p> My suggestion is that we use the post-Piagetian vocabulary to begin a new conversation that is both human and cultural . In this conversation , children are competent storytellers . Story telling is a deeply significant activity in the construction of meaning , of culture itself . And art is a powerful form of story telling . <p> Art is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sense of their existence , of themselves as human beings , as people . It is not a medium for transporting meaning or beauty or truth . It is a tool for constructing meaning . Art is a way that we tell ( to paraphrase Clifford Geertz 17 ) stories about ourselves to ourselves and others . <p> If art does not tell a story of some kind to us , if it does not connect to our human sense  --  whether it uses words or not is unimportant  --  then it remains inaccessible . Consider that whatever we produce in the way of art , from dance to poem to piece of jazz , we give it a name . And that very name makes it accessible . I personally find the rare piece that is merely numbered most inaccessible and very marginal to any story that I can comprehend or be part of telling . A Filial Example <p> Since her birth , I have explored art with my daughter , now six . Not surprisingly , she has been exposed to that art that is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old time string band music , and contemporary extensions of these . From the beginning , my sense was that this music would be accessible to her because much of it is verbally narrative , and because it can be connected to her human sense of the mountains of Virginia , where she was bom , and of rural Illinois , where we now live . <p> I have long listened with much attention to the music of John Hartford , a contemporary artist of the tradition I am discussing . Much of Hartford 's music is about rivers. 18 From his songs , I became very interested in rivers , particularly the Mississippi . The songs led me to books , to read for the first time Mark Twain 's Life on the Mississippi and to reread The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . Most importantly , the songs led me to the rivers themselves . With my daughter , I sought out rivers in our travels . We stopped and stood by them and tried to feel them the way Hartford did . Over the years we admired the Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New . We found favorite spots and revisited them , and we sat and watched the barges and the steamboats . There is , for example , a particularly beautiful park in downtown Gallipolis , Ohio , where one can sit by the Ohio River and look across at West Virginia . The river is quite wide at that point , and one can see far up and down it . At sunset , it is a most wonderful place to be . <p> The rivers became meaningful because of the songs , and the songs became more meaningful because of those times we lingered on the rivers ' banks . For a long time , the two of us never made it to the mighty Mississippi . One spring day when my daughter was four , we drove to St. Louis . For the three-hour drive , we listened to Hartford 's songs about the Mississippi ( " It 's too thick to navigate , and it 's too thin to plow . . . . " ) . When we got to St. Louis , we drove down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TABLE <p> We parked and found a place from which we could comfortably watch the river . I found a place to sit , but she stood there transfixed . She watched the Mississippi for more than an hour , occasionally turning to tell me something or to show me something . Finally , I had to tell her it was time to go . Reluctantly we left . <p> My point is not that she has a long attention span  --  like most children , her span depends on the situation  --  but that Hartford 's songs had given the river meaning , they had helped her make sense of the Mississippi . The Mississippi had meaning for her . She made it part of her story . Since then , whenever we cross a river , she will chant , " It 's muddy , but not as muddy as the MissiSSIPPeeee . " <p> The process is , of course , a complexly reiterative one . Hartford 's songs were meaningful to her because we had talked about the songs and the rivers , and because we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally , because the songs and the rivers had become part of her story about her world and herself . <p> None of this would have happened if she had not heard the songs , if I had not played them for her . Children , all of us , only have access to what is made available to us . If art is not made available to us , and if it is not made part of our daily fives , of our human sense , we have no access to it . Some Mundane Implications <p> To repeat my argument , it is time to stop speaking of readiness and stages and egocentrism , of young scientists and self-expression and individualism . Instead , we should speak of competence and human sense , familiarity and accessibility , young storytellers and social construction . <p> Once we are able to use these words and make them meaningful , we should begin with the obvious , the immediate , the local . For American children familiar with rivers , the songs of John Hartford are more accessible than those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly . Like Hartford , Bartok worked in a folk tradition . The issue here , however , is where to begin . American children should begin with that music most accessible to their human sense . Later , one can move to other , more distant , traditions . <p> Folk art is a good place to begin , not to the exclusion of other forms , but folk art is grounded in the locality , in the everyday experience of the residents of an area . Start with that art that is most narrative , but start with that which is art . Children do not have to be exposed to popular culture in the classroom . Nor do they have to be introduced to " children 's " art . There are many good " children 's " musicians , etc. , but much of what children have access to is poorly played , sung , and produced and often mindless . There is a place in this world for the humorous ditties that children learn at summer camp , but there is also room for songs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that describe the plight of the modem-day family farmer  --  for example , " This Old House " by Craig Bickhardt and T. Schuyler , or " Devil , Take the Farmer " by Dave Gordonhave special meaning to midwestem children who hear of weekly farm auctions and who drive by abandoned farm houses. 20 <p> How does one find good folk art ? Ask the artists . Mathematicians decide what is good mathematics . Psychologists decide what is good psychology . Ask blue grass musicians what is good blue grass , or string band musicians what is good string band , folk dancers what is good folk dance  --  not the best , because there one will probably get heated debate , but what is good . And begin there . <p> Does this make sense for children living in suburbia or deep in the ghettos of big cities ? Can we as easily connect to their human sense ? The art is there . There is a long tradition of music describing urban life . There are stories and storytellers . There are urban artists . And unlike their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to museums , and in those museums are paintings and sculptures that tell stories that they can connect to , if those who bring them do the preparation necessary to forge those connections . <p> I should like to emphasize this last point . Preparation is not a fifteenminute " advance organizer , " perhaps a look at a brochure . Preparation must pervade the daily fife of the classroom . That hour my daughter spent constructing her story of the Mississippi did not just happen serendipitously . The Hartford tapes were not in the car by chance that day , or the months and years before . There had been many many hours of listening and talking and dawdling on river banks , of taking old winding highways that followed the rivers instead of the new arrow-straight interstates . <p> But how can I be sure that she really understood the songs , the river itself ? To be sure , she did not . No one fully understands the Mississippi , but she is beginning to . For years , early childhood educators have been obsessed with the fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What if I present something and they do n't get it ? What of their self-esteem ? Will not their lack of understanding unduly pressure children or , worse , expose them to failure ? <p> In the old conversation , perhaps . But in the new conversation , these fears do not make ( human ) sense . In the new conversation , understanding is a long and slowly developing process . Nobody understands anything the first time around . It is simply pointless to say of children or anyone that they will not understand something , or , for that matter , that they will . As adults , we are always exaggerating our own understandings , and we are underestimating children 's . Lilian G. Katz and Sylvia Chard observed that we continually make the mistake of overestimating children academically but underestimating them intellectually. 21 <p> No matter how complicated something is , if we can connect it to children 's human sense , then they are beginning to understand it . Bruner , for decades , was derided by Piagetians for asserting that one could teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest way , but he was saying something important . The " anything " part unfortunately distracted people from his point-how about advanced topology , or quantum physics , critics asked . <p> The goal is not to teach children anything , but those things that a given culture deems important . What is important can be taught if we can connect it to children 's human sense . Will they completely understand it ? Of course not . Those of us who claim to be experts in some tiny and arcane area of academic knowledge must daily face the reality that the harder we work the less we understand . Very few people completely understand anything . The understanding of something is developed over a long period , but it can not begin if children are not exposed to that something . The understanding of art is a lifelong process . We should begin it early and maintain it late . <p> As Gary Price wisely observed a decade ago , pressure comes not from teaching children something but from expecting them to produce or perform . His suggestion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until later than we have , thereby giving children " a prolonged , pressure-free period of familiarization " 22 is a critically important one . <p> Let the kids linger awhile by the Mississippi , stick their toes in its muddy water . It 's part of the story of who we are . Or better , of the story we are telling about ourselves . Cut back on the academics and listen to some more music and sing some more songs , good songs the cute pictures of talking animals off the walls . Put up some pictures with meaning . <p> The goal is not to express ourselves , but instead to construct ourselves and our relations with each other by , as Rorty has suggested , replacing the descriptions imposed upon us by others with our own descriptions , in our own language . We are to create ourselves by telling our own stories . <p> One can organize schooling in ways that make children smart and artistic , and one can organize schooling in ways that do not . Children deserve to become both listeners to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the important task of telling their stories , in song , dance , painting , whatever . And they need the time necessary to begin doing that . Art takes a while . Usually a lifetime . <p> In the meantime , we can take our cue from Reggio Emilia , Italy , where the children spent forty days constructing their drawings , paintings , and sculptures of the stone lions that stood in a local plaza. 22 That 's about thirty-nine days and twenty-three-anda-half hours more than most children in our schools get for their artistic constructions , at least in the old way of talking about art and young children . <p> <p>
