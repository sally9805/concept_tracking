he real problem with the Democratic party is not the lingering popularity of Ronald Reagan or the trivialization of American politics . The problem is the Democrats themselves and whether they have the will to repair their divisions and agree upon a presidential message . In the last two presidential elections , Walter Mon-dale and then Michael Dukakis came across less as political visionaries than as vouchers for sundry special interests . Democrats in Congress seem to be held captive to even narrower interests ? a wife in need of a job or a campaign contributor seeking a contract . The most prominent Democrat today may well be a black preacher who has held no public office and who a good many Democrats fear will make a third run for the presidency . Unable to confront the contradictions in their party , Democratic leaders now speak in a code burdened with euphemism and , when before the cameras , strike game but unconvincing poses . To goad the Democrats toward recovery , Harper 's Magazine recently invited seven prominent Democrats to a smokeless back room to candidly discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promising message for the race in 1992 . JACK HITT : The Democrats have been an opposition party , on the national level , for a decade now . In that time , President Reagan 's tactic in dealing with the Democrats was confrontation . President Bush 's tactic is co-optation . Both approaches appear to have worked . While there have been certain victories , the Democrats have n't launched a real offensive . BRUCE BABBITT : That 's true because our success as a congressional party is precisely our weakness as a presidential party . Out success is in what I call the politics of disaggregation , or discrete issues . The presidency is about larger themes , particularly the national economy and national security . That 's where we are weak . ROLAND BURRIS : Our problem begins with the loss of House Speaker Jim Wright and majority whip Tony Coelho in the House . We do n't have cohesion among the leaders . Speaker Torn Foley is a good man , but he 's not a tough politician like Wright was . The question is , Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBERT REICH : That is the issue . The Democrats do well locally because they are the party that delivers public services ? everything from highways and bridges to education to pork . But they are no longer perceived as the party of national strategy . When I ask myself why , I think of Gertrude Stein 's dictum about Oakland : " There 's no ' there ' there . " Democrats have no philosophy that enables them to articulate thinking on the economy and national defense . KATHLEEN TOWNSEND : It 's worse than that . Democrats are not doing a good job of delivering services , particularly education . BARBARA BOXER : I disagree with the premise . It 's difficult to articulate great national issues when you do n't have the White House . So you become the loyal opposition . We are doing that well . Take the off-year elections . Why do you think we are winning these things ? BURRIS : Barbara , when we deliver two presidents in twenty-four years , there is a problem . BOXER : We have n't had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had great candidates . Nominees . . . well REICH : We 've had one very intelligent candidate , and I mean that sincerely , Bruce . But Democrats do n't know how to be an opposition party . One of the great political sleights of hand in the 1980s has been the ability of Republicans 4E , HARPER 'S MAGAZINE / JANUARY 1990 to distance themselves from government while running it . Democrats , instead of sticking the Republicans ' feet to the fire on issues such as the savings-and-loan scandals , act as if they 're still running the government . They seem defensive . TOWNSEND : Well , they should be . A lot of the S &L; scandals involve Democrats . If we 're going to become Republicans and take large amounts of business political action committee money , we ca n't blame the S &L; scandals on Republicans . BARNEY FRANK : Not true . Kathleen , did you take PAC money when you ran ? TOWNSEND : Yes . FRANK : Were you going to be in thrall to the PACs if you got elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I take PAC money and I am not . I wish we had public financing , but let 's not beat ourselves up because we do n't . I do n't believe taking PAC money is a serious problem , distinct from taking private money from individuals . PAC money is not a useful intellectual construct . The issue is public versus private financing . REICH : Barney , Tony Coelho went to the business community in the mid-1980s with a message : " You will do better to invest in incumbent Democrats than in challenger Republicans , because Democrats are in control and here to stay . " FRANK : And certain people got some intervention in individual cases . As far as public policy is concerned , there is not much influence . The clout of the S &Ls; stems from grass-roots lobbying , not money . Money follows votes , not the other way around . I 've tried to think of an issue where we were deterred from doing what we should have done because of PAC money . I ca n't . HITT : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cut that benefits the wealthiest . FRANK : Capital gains was about ideology , not corruption . You engage in intellectual reductionism when you say that . Democrats who voted for capital gains thought it was a good idea . HITT : Barney , how would you answer the many people who believe that PACs have shifted the constituency of the Democrats away from the working man and closer to , say , Charles Keating , the head of Lincoln Savings &; Loan who donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats and received a delay in the investigation of his failing S &L?; FRANK : Part of it is bad history . Democrats were never a crusading , populist , **26;4171;TOOLONG crowd . Already the 1950s exist . as a golden age , and it 's always dangerous to set up a golden age . Lyndon Johnson , Sam Rayburn ? who are we talking about here ? BENJAMIN BARBER : To me , the great paradox of this era is that the Republicans have found a way to sell the interests of the wealthiest as the national good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me too . The Democrats , who actually represent majoritarian concerns , have found those issues denigrated as special interests . And they have not found a way to conceptualize them as a coherent national interest . TOWNSEND : Part of the problem , Ben , is that the Republican party has exploited racism and that most blacks are in the Democratic party . This is a divisive issue that exists sub rosa . Reagan launched his campaign in Philadelphia , Mississippi . He did n't have to say that he was pro-white ; it was implicit . Bush used Willie Horton as an emblem of crime , but the racial message is there . On the other hand , there is a connection between crime and race . In Maryland , more college-age black men are in jail than in school . So , you can pretend race and crime is n't an issue or you can acknowledge that people have something to fear . In the past presidential campaign , the Democrats did n't respond , and therefore the people do n't trust us . BURRIS : That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Alabama and South Carolina . There has been a flight of white voters because Democrats have reached out to blacks . BOXER : I do n't buy this . Reagan begged the South to give him a Republican senate in 1986 . They gave him a Democratic one . BURRIS : With 35 percent of the white vote and 95 percent of the black vote . BOXER : So be it ; it 's a coalition we can win with . BABBITT : If the problem is how to reslice the pie , you enlarge the pie . Now , you ca n't do that with more programs . You must start making sensible budgets and tax and investment decisions that , however painful today , will give us a chance to win an election in two years . REICH : Historically , the party has functioned best when we can say that we 're all in the same boat ? during war , depression , or some crisis . BABBITT : And when we are in a period of stability , we latch onto the us-versus-them rhetoric . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more of " us " ; now there 's more of " them . " REICH : As the party of inclusion , we have traditionally needed a them . The them has either FORUM 47 been a foreign power ? Russia , Nazi Germany , Japan ? or an economic elite . I do n't think that defining us by defining them is a good strategy . Unfortunately , without a major economic or international crisis , you 're almost thrown into defining us by targeting them . And i see Democrats in the future setting up either Japan or the top 10 percent income group as the them . It 's either jingoism or populism . FRANK : I disagree . Enlightened nationalism is a reasonable way to pull together a majority . BARBER : There 's one problem : Democrats love to advertise their parts . They talk about inclusion , but they prove it by playing to their separate parts ? blacks , Hispanics , gays , radicals , women , conservationists . Republicans point to the whole . Now , it may be an illusory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do n't belong feel that one day they will . FRANK : Democrats do n't point to the parts ; the parts insist on being pointed to This goes back to the ' 68 and ' 72 fights , when we learned that party activists would much rather punch another Democrat than beat a Republican . I remember Jack Newfield 's great line that the NDC ? the New Democratic Coalition ? actually stood for " November Does n't Count . " None of these issues will work unless the different factions of the party ? the gays , the blacks , the peaceniks , the radicals ? leave the nominee alone after the convention so he can chase swing voters . The Jesse Factor BURRIS : You 're really talking about blacks . None of those other groups offer 95 percent of their vote to the Democratic party . FRANK : Some of them ? peaceniks and others ? do make up that much of the vote in other places . But what you say to those people is , " We 'll do you no good if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1984 convention , " Everybody got something but us . " I said , " No . None of us gets anything unless we win . " So to black voters I say , " Fight like hell in the primary . But once the primary is over , decide which of the two candidates will best advance your issues . " If the black voters do n't think that Walter Mondale is better for them than Ronald Reagan , or that Michael Dukakis is better than George Bush , then we wo n't win . HITT : We 've arrived at the Jesse Jackson question . He may run in 1992 . Do you want him to run ' If not , how would you tell him not to ? BOXER : Look , Michael Dukakis is talking about running again . I would not hesitate to say , " Michael , it would n't be good for the party . " HITF : My fifteen-year-old nephew could tell Dukakis not to run . Jesse is an entirely different conversation . BOXER : I would say to Jesse , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and losing , " You run the risk of becoming a Harold Stassen . " BURRIS : But the problem is the black vote . We need a strategy that will reach out and capture that black vote regardless of Jesse 's candidacy . Consider that Dukakis lost Illinois by only 95,000 votes . Not Chicago , but Illinois . A lot of black voters sat on their hands because of the mistreatment of Jesse . FRANK : Jesse was not mistreated . He did n't win . BURRIS : People made a lot out of Dukakis not calling Jackson about the vice presidency . FRANK : Then I 'd say to the black voters , " If you are going to refuse to vote for someone for president who 'll act demonstrably more in your interest because somebody did n't phone somebody , I wash my hands of the situation . " I am serious . We have encouraged people to be self-indulgent in our various groups . I say , " You have it in your power to keep us from winning if you react this way . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; we will never win . " BURRIS : Right now the party says , " We do n't want to highlight or flaunt a Doug Wilder or an Andy Young or a Bill Gray . " FRANK : Roland , look at the party . Ron Brown is the chairman , Bill Gray the House whip . BURRIS : We do not market that to the black community . BOXER : Our convention markets our diversity . How many million Americans watch that on television ? BURRIS : We may see Jesse and all of this together , ness onstage , but if Jesse says , " I was mis-treated ? " BOXER : That 's his problem . BURRIS : It 's our problem ! Treat it that way , and I say we will never win the presidency . FRANK : There has been a recognition of black Democrats in many positions . That 's as much as can be done by any institution . When you say that they do n't market it , there is no " they . " The individuals themselves have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undercut Ron Brown . He has run into power plays , and he 's 48 HARPERS MAGAZINE / JANUARY 1990 not been given proper status as the chairman of the party . FRANK : You 're setting an impossible standard and , by that standard , we will fail . TOWNSEND : I do n't understand , Roland . Do you want more black leaders to go out and speak to blacks ? To whites ? 1 mean , blacks are in the Democratic party . BURRIS : We must have a strategic outreach program that encourages blacks to stick with the Democrats even if they do not have a black leader " running out there . " Then we 've got to bring Southern whites back into the party and convince them that having blacks in the party is no threat to them . As a black statewide-elected official who gets more white than black votes , have the credentials to do that . That 's why I , for one , go to white voters and deliver that message . It can be done . Representative Mike Espy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . We can get ' em , but we need a strategy . FRANK : No one is stopping blacks from doing that , Roland . That 's my point . People who want to do that will do it . This notion that there 's somebody withholding support is just wrong . BURRIS : There 's no concerted strategy . FRANK : That 's American politics . BARBER : Again , if we talk about the parts rather than the whole , we 're lost . The question is , Is America going to become black or are blacks going to become equal citizens in America ? Right now , Americans think the Democratic party is about selling America to blacks or gays , not about including blacks and gays in an America we all belong to . Right now , the rhetoric is separatist : Vote Democratic if you want to give America to blacks . Vote Republican if you want to give America not to whites hut , in that rhetoric , to all Americans . The Democrats need a language that speaks to the whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation . Reading Ups HITT : Let 's try another tough one . What 's the new Democratic message on taxes ? BURRIS : No taxes . FRANK : Reallocate resources from the military . REICH : That the coward 's way out . BARBER : We 're not asking people to be better than they are ; we need to do that . FRANK : Is the goal to win the 1992 election or the 2012 one ? HITT : Governor Babbitt , tell us your view ? and , please . keep your seat . BABBITT : By 1992 the budget may be really out of control , and there may be an opening to FRANK : We 've been saying that for ten years . BABBITT : Okay . Maybe a Democratic candidate says that he strives for a balanced budget , not along Gramm-Rudman lines but by changing priorities , reducing expenditures , and raising revenues . It works at the state level because it 's being done in an atmosphere of fiscal restraint , new priorities , and exhaustion of other alternatives . BURRIS : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame federal cutbacks . Washington ca n't use that excuse . BOXER : Why not propose a pay-as-you-go plan , an idea of California Representative George Miller 's ? We do n't have to pinpoint exact taxes , but we can say , " From now on we will hold our budget to the same overall dollar amount . For anything we add , we either subtract a program or find a revenue source for it . " We do n't have to go into the details , and we can be smart and honest at the same time . FRANK : Robert , 1 want to tell you how unhappy 1 am with your cowardice quip . It 's an unworthy intellectual concept . Is it not possible that someone might disagree with you and argue that an appeal to raise taxes would be counter-productive ? REICH : If you 're a coward , you 're a coward . FRANK : You 're debasing the discussion . REICH : There is a difference between wise strategy and failed leadership . Both may dictate that you avoid hard issues . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert ! Barney 's right . There 's no way in the world we 're going to bring down an incumbent by saying that we 've got to raise taxes . Now 1 like Barbara 's pay-as-you-go plan . Let 's FORUM 49 make the federal government accountable for the dollars that the people send to Washington . With that language , I guarantee you we will make headway . REICH : See , there are two insidious parts to the Republican strategy . First , they have created the budget deficit , which makes it impossible to spend public money . Second , through the HUD scandal , the S &L; fiasco , and the malfeasance of military contractors , they have created profound doubts about the capacities of government to undertake anything . This puts us in a box , unless we are willing to tell Americans , " We have to invest more , privately and publicly . " More federal money must be spent on public investment . And we must increase private savings by going after leveraged buyouts and takeovers , encouraging corporate savings , creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we change the configuration of savings and investment , we 're lost . FRANK : Robert , it must be nice sitting there , feeling all that bravery and saying , " This is what I 'll say . " But 250 million Americans will not file by and ask for a seven-minute discourse . So the media will translate your message for you , and they will say , " Reich favors more taxes . " TOWNSEND : And please , when we use words like investment and infrastructure , my eyes glaze over . You 're going to need crisp , graphic language if you 're going to win on taxes , especially if you think Americans will vote to raise taxes . BABBITT : Did n't San Francisco impose a tax surcharge for earthquake relief ? TOWNSEND : Yes . BABBITT : Does that suggest anything to you ? FRANK : Yes . If we have a national earthquake , we can raise taxes . Taking off the Hair Shirt HITT : Robert Reich , you once wrote that the difference between the parties is that Republicans " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In 1980 it was the story of a threat to America ? from communism , from a bloated government , from criminals , from social engineers . Can anyone at this table come up with an encompassing narrative for the 1992 Democratic nominee to tell ? FRANK : Here 's what he says : America has spent the forty-five years since World War II carrying the burden for the rest of the world , some of which is still appropriate . But we should no longer shoulder the burden , in NATO and elsewhere , for our competitors ? West Germany , France , England , Holland , Japan . Today , East Germany , Hungary , and Poland are leaving the communist bloc . We can now say , " Harry Truman , we succeeded . Containment has worked , the Marshall Plan has worked , and the occupation of Japan has worked . " It 's time to come back home . We can reorient those resources toward education , improve our international competitive strategy , and be nicer to ourselves . And we can make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American triumphalism , not beating up on American imperialism . BOXER : " America 's Time Has Come . " BABBITT : We 're talking renewal , investment , education , basic science , and research . Be careful of jingoism . If we then blame our problems on , say , Japan , it 's negative populism , the politics of despair . Use the sense of opposition to Japan to channel our national concern into an opportunity to renew our society . BOXER : The 1990s should be " The Decade for America . " We 've done a good job defending the world . We 've won . Communism is a failure . Now we have more resources for our children . Recently Fortune Magazine ? no Democratic mouthpiece ? argued that for the next ten years , for the good of the country , we should cut $10 billion a year from defense and transfer it to our own people . FRANK : And , unlike weapons systems , there are no congressmen protecting pork in NATO . BABBITT : 1 disagree . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Vietnam peace dividend . There may be some marginal military savings , but it 's no panacea . There can be some reorientation of money , but it does n't make up for our economic policies . We ought to be giving more foreign aid , not less . We must integrate into a world economy . FRANK : 1 disagree sharply . The savings are more than marginal . Foreign aid , yes . But 300.000 troops in Europe is preposterous . We 're talking billions of dollars here . Let 's muster ' em out . REICH : There are two ways to tell this alternative story . One is to talk about reallocating resources from national defense in order to rebuild the country 's infrastructure and schools . The other story is populist . Here we advocate a progressive income tax , reining in Wall Street , and we talk about the wealthy getting wealthier and the poor getting poorer . There are dangers in both stories . Enlightened nationalism easily deteriorates into jingoism . And populism very easily transmogrifies into soak-the-rich demagoguery . BABBITT : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / JANUARY 1990 Europe . But we ca n't lower our military presence in the Pacific by even one airplane . FRANK : Oh , Bruce . BABBITT : Ask the Chinese , the Japanese , the Soviets if they want a reduced American presence ! BOXER : Can the Japanese afford it ? FRANK : Who are the Soviets , the Chinese , and the Japanese afraid of ? The Indonesians ? BABBITT : Each other . FRANK : Why is it my responsibility to starve kids in America and deny people medical care because these countries are afraid of each other ? BABBITT : Because it works for us too . FRANK : It worked for us . Let 's change it . BABBITT : Withdraw ? FRANK : Not withdraw . Reduce . BURRIS : I am also for redirecting resources out of Europe and Asia as communism crumbles . But it looks like we 're weak FRANK : America is winon defense again . ning , Roland ! The message is not anti-American ; it 's pro-American . BOXER : I think it can work . Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at opportunities . Democrats should seize the initiative . We have a $300 billion defense budget . That is up 100 percent from 1980 . Transfer 5 percent from that budget and make us stronger by doing it . Does that mean we 're not prepared if Gorbachev is overthrown and some Neanderthal takes over ? We 're still the strongest military power in the world . That 's the context in which we say let 's make this the decade for America . BARBER : Swords to plowshares , great . But if this nation had the will to do something for education , we would n't wait to cash in some soldiers to buy more teachers . That we have no will is partly the Democrats ' fault . If the only way we can get the people to do anything is to reach into military coffers , we have not solved the problem . Maybe there is no solution , but to me , this condemns us to ongoing cynicism . FRANK : What 's your answer ? BARBER : if Americans wanted it , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest-taxed nation in the world . FRANK : If you think taxing ourselves is equivalent to bringing soldiers home from Europe , you do n't make any sense . BARBER : We have not yet found a way to convince Americans of the importance of these issues the way we once convinced them that they had to pay out of their hides , if necessary , to protect themselves from communism . That 's the issue . BABBITT : What do you think would happen if the president , with rich rhetoric and passion , went to the people and said , " It 's time to rebuild this country to assure another American century . I am going to give the following sums to rebuild university laboratories , to give scholarships , and to establish a national Head Start program . And I am asking every American to agree to a 5 percent increase in the gas tax " ? FRANK : We tried it ; it did n't sell . BABBITT : Who tried it ? BOXER : Senator Bob Dole . TOWNSEND : I do n't think Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes . BABBITT : You do n't think Democrats could make headway with an education program and an earmarked revenue source ? REICH : In the election of 1936 , FDR said , " No American should have an income over $25,000 " ? roughly $200,000 today . Congress did n't go along entirely , but it did pass a progressive tax bill . By contrast , we now have the lowest tax rate on high incomes of any industrialized nation in the world . FRANK : A fine ideological point , Bob , but sell it ! REICH : There are two sources of revenue ; one is military , the other is FRANK : Bob , you 're debating the merits , not the politics . We agree on the merits , but BARBER : You only want to win elections , Barney ! That 's what 's wrong . FRANK : No . It 's about making public policy . BARBER : If you become Ronald Reagan in order to win , then you end up Ronald Reagan . FRANK : No one said that . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore FORUM 51 should not be advocated does not make you like Ronald Reagan . This is mindlessness . BARBER : You only want to win . FRANK : We want to win to effect public policy . BOXER : In telling our story of America winning , we could also point out that the Republican story had some very sad endings . One in five kids lives in poverty FRANK : No , we ca n't . We are always preaching doom and gloom ; we sound like we are wearing hair shirts . We are a bit like the guy with the sign that says , " The world 's going to end on Thursday . " Well , it 's the following Tuesday afternoon . REICH : Put it in terms of preparing ourselves and our kids for a future in which we have control over our destinies , a future of great opportunities . This concern for future generations is a powerful theme , and it implies accurately that we have been squandering that future . TOWNSEND : Exactly . Do n't talk about squandering ; imply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The task of leadership is precisely to allow people to care about the things that they need to care about . TOWNSEND : It 's going to be tough to come up with the language . " Good schools " is very boring . Everybody wants good schools . We should have high expectations for students and insist that all children can learn , can achieve . And not just academically but in their character as well . We should insist that children be taught to act with decency and honor , that they have a sense of self-respect , that they love their country and perform community service . You hear about the land ethic in the language of the environment because people feel they have a special relationship to the land . People want something spiritual , something beautiful in their lives . Think of FDR 's WPA : That was n't just a work program . It created something beautiful . The Democrats can also speak of exploration , opening up space , and curing diseases . These issues enrich our lives and reveal us to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in the Democratic spirit that lifts us up . BURRIS : The Republicans created a deficit and a housing shortage , so we need only come up with a language that pushes the positive . We will reach the voters the same way the Republicans did with confetti and the flag . REICH : That 's close . Suppose we talk about a new patriotism , one that does not depend upon guns and B-2 bombers but upon brainpower . The Cold War has been supplanted by a Cold Peace , in which nations compete on the basis of brains and capacities . The new patriotism means sacrificing a bit for our kids . BABBITT : Children are really a metaphor for the future . Children are not perceived as welfare programs or property of the state . They represent future , investment , and education . BARBER : How 's this for a Democratic slogan : " Today 's Party for Tomorrow 's America . " Tomorrow , the future , is a significant theme because Reagan and Bush 's vision is really about today . Reagan said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That may create a productive economy , but that 's the language of today . The language of tomorrow is about cooperation , not competition . It is a rich and resonant language , and we do n't use it much , The Republican language is also about taking : It 's okay to take ; it 's good for the economy . The powerful language of giving has not been used . All the discussion of service today comes out of that neglected need to give . Invest ? you use that word all the time , Bob ? is part of this language . To a Republican the voter is a consumer . Weil , let 's talk about the citizen . Civic language is an open language for the Democrats to seize upon . It 's a language of participation and engagement and empowerment . And a full set of issues flows from that language ? education , environment , space , technology , risk taking . Those are issues of the future , and they constitute an alternative vision to trickle-down economics . BOXER : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe it 's " renewed patriotism , " so that people wo n't ask , " What 's wrong with the old patriotism ? " But I am worried about ideas like cooperation . I want fo stress the individual in some way . Think about abortion and the pro-choice issue . FRANK : I agree ; that has to be resolved . I like these ideas as long as we are clear that we are telling people they will be the beneficiaries . You ca n't preach sacrifice over the long haul . REICH : The children will be the beneficiaries . 52 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE / JANUARY 1990 FRANK : No , it 's not just children . There are people who are n't worried about children . There are old people and others . We ca n't tell them the payoff is in twenty years . I think enlightened self-interest is the best you can get , There is room to do both . Ronald Reagan believed in free enterprise the way some people believe in unicorns . He believed in it even when it was n't there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats believe in free enterprise , and we know what it does and does n't do . We know there are values and goals in our society that free enterprise ca n't achieve . But you express it all in terms of self-interest . You ca n't say one in five lives in poverty , because the other four do n't care . Do n't beat people up and tell them they 've been rotten and selfish and mean . Democrats do that . We must say , " Yes , we 're going to have all these programs , " but in the context of " We 're doing a terrific job but we can do better . " BURRIS : As we strive to pull in the middle class , let 's not forget the underclass , one of our traditional constituencies . BABBITT : None of us is advocating that the underclass be abandoned ; that concern is the essence of being a Democrat . But we must admit that much of the welfare state has been an utter failure . Advocacy for the underprivileged must now be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but opportunity . That 's why saying one in five children lives in poverty is critical : It implies that we will reach out and , through education , create the opportunity . That 's why the health-care issue remains alive and important ; it 's an enabling issue . BOXER : Let me point out that the business community fears what 's happening to kids in poverty . They see a future work force that is not prepared . We 're hearing powerful CEOs say , " Invest $10 billion in our children right now . " The Populist Story REICH : The narrative of investing in the future is one story . But remember there 's also the populist story , and it 's about FRANK : beating each other up . REICH : The Democratic party represents the underdog ? Joe Lunchbucket not the global cor-porations , not the rich . We stand for worker participation , control over pension funds , and a progressive income tax . BARBER : A teacher of mine at Harvard , Louis Hartz , argued that in the American liberal tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are one country , not a class-war country , and that parties that try class warfare fail . BABBITT : The populist issue of the Thirties was labor versus management . Today , the populist issues are worker participation , worker ownership , and . worker-controlled pension plans . REICH : What about worker control over pension plans ? It 's a very specific idea , and I have n't heard the Democrats FRANK : It was on the floor ; we voted on it . Do n't assume that because it has n't been on the front page of the New York Times that it has n't happened . The bill was put forward ; it became a partisan issue ; and we lost REICH : You 're talking programs . I know the bill , I testified FRANK : So do n't say nobody 's talking about it . We did ; no one listened . REICH : But it 's not part of the Democratic story . FRANK : Who 's telling this story ? You have this view that someone is telling the Democratic story and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person ; there is no voice from the burning bush saying , " Worker control of pensions . " BABBITT : We 've conceptualized it as a program rather than as a value , as pension reform rather than worker participation . FRANK : Well , Bruce , you 're wrong . That 's how it was conceptualized : worker participation . REICH : The issue should be part of a constellation of issues where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts . Party leaders are not saying , " Here are ten issues the Democrats really believe in and together they stand for the following principles : worker participation , workplace democracy , standing up for the little guy . " BARBER : And why that matters is because we are a nation of neighbors . This country was built by neighbors , not by individuals . You work that into your story . FRANK : That wo n't work . It leads to class warfare . I remember Louis Hartz 's Gov. 203 , too . He said it is hard to get Americans , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in class terms . Remember McGovern ? He went after the inheritance tax in 1972 . It backfired because most Americans believe that one day they will be rich . But 1 want to stress the point that there 's no mechanism to get fourteen diverse Democrats to say the same thing . BURRIS : Has Speaker Foley sat down with the lead-ership FORUM 53 FRANK : What leadership ? BURRIS : ? the Democratic Caucus ? to explain his vision of BARBER : Fat chance ? FRANK : His vision of what ? BURRIS : ? what 's going on in America ? FRANK : Foley has not ; Senate majority leader George Mitchell gave a big speech laying out his program , andBURRIS : Did Mitchell talk to the Senate or the Democrats ? FRANK : You 're not getting the answers you want so you 're turning this into a prosecution . BURRIS : You do n't even know where I 'm going . FRANK : I do n't like you playing district attorney . HITT : Gentlemen , please . BURRIS : I 'm trying to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district BURRIS : If you want to answer my question , fine ; if not , shut up . FRANK : I have answered it : Mitchell did ; Foley did n't . You do n't like the answer . REICH : Let me try something . The purpose of a vision is to ensure that the sum of programs is greater than the individual parts . Now , the Republicans have had a vision into which they fit their programs . It was grounded in part on social Darwinism and neoclassical economics . FRANK : No . What was the unified Republican vision in 1979 ? There was n't one . BURRIS : " Get the government off people 's backs . " REICH : It was a vision based on the government screwing things up , particularly Great Society programs . It stood for trickle-down economics and a strong defense . It was like the big lie . Say it over and over again , supply enough anecdotal evidence , offer a few programs , and it begins to sound coherent and truthful . FRANK : You 're talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described Reagan . Bush and Dole were n't saying any of that in 1979 , BURRIS : But it did n't come out of a vacuum . It came from the Heritage Foundation . They polled continuously until they found a message to craft . BARBER : But you know why ? Because they believed in something . We do n't believe . We think they 're wrong , but they believed . They did n't say , " How can we win ? " or " Can we sell it ? " FRANK : Ben , that 's just distortion . Have you heard anyone say that there 's a particular value they care about that they 're ready to sacrifice for win-nine I have n't . BARBER : Every time someone makes a suggestion , Barney , you say , We tried it ; it wo n't sell , " FRANK : Urn talking about strategy , not programs . BARBER : Barney , you and Bob are wrong to underestimate the Republican story by calling it the big lie . To the extent that Americans felt better about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making more money ? even if they were n't ? it was not a big lie . It worked . REICH : In the 1980s , it was the big lie : This is the only economic recovery we 've had in our history in which average Americans are worse off now than they were before . BARBER : But how people feel counts . What they believe counts . Symbols count . BURRIS : They made the white conservative voter feel good by saying , " Do n't let this black person get near you . " So we traded high interest rates and inflation for a bigger deficit and unemployment . There have been no economic gains . We 're living on a damn credit card rather than on high interest rates and inflation . But you ca n't sell that , because the Republicans know that when a person uses a credit card he does n't give a damn how much is owed on it . BOXER : That trade-off , Roland , was won by the politics of fear . We must counter with the politics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'll ask this one more time . What do they fear ? Drugs , disarray , and crime ? especially crime . FRANK : Democrats have to admit to a mistake first . We have intimidated ourselves out of saying that people who hit other people over the head ? no matter what their childhood was like ? are rotten people who ought to be locked up . Poverty and racism may explain , even pre- . dict , violent crime , but they do not excuse it . BURRIS : Put the criminals in jail . HITT : That 's what Republicans say . REICH : Go beyond that . You could say that the black community is suffering more than the white community . FRANK : Do n't say that . BURRIS : I can say that . FRANK : You 're right . You can . 54 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE / JANUARY 1990 American Mythology REICH : Let 's back up . There are mythological stories that both Democrats and Republicans have to tell . One has to do with what I call the " mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rot at the top . " For Republicans , the mob at the gates has been communists and criminals ; and the rot at the top has been liberal intellectuals and bureaucrats . Now , what are the Democrats ' stories for the mob at the gates ? The Japanese ? And for the rot at the top ? Wall Street speculators ? HITT : For rot at the top , the Democrats could say , " For years Republicans have said Democrats throw money at problems . Now we know where they throw money ? at each other . " TOWNSEND : Problem is , every time you look at corruption , there 's a Democrat involved . FRANK : As an issue , corruption cancels out . The public believes both parties are suspect . Watergate gave one party a onetime advantage . As a general rule , though , corruption does n't work . TOWNSEND : What about the idea of government itself as an issue ? If you 've tried to get anything out of government recently , you will be disgusted and horrified at how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . TOWNSEND : We should say , " We are going to make government work again ; no more unresponsive bureaucrats fouling the works . " FRANK : You 're right , Kathleen . We are sometimes too pro-government for our own good . BURRIS : Especially when the Republicans are in power ; we should run against government . HITT : What 's the language ? How do you win with the message " Put Democrats back in charge of government " ? You 've got to be kidding . BARBER : Republicans are always crying , " Get government off our backs . " My slogan is , " Get government off our backs and put it back into our hands . " In other words , make it a citizens ' government , the instrument of cooperation . Let 's get rid of big government . FRANK : At the federal level , that becomes very conservative . REICH : Is that a populist platform , Ben ? FRANK : That 's Ronald Reagan 's 1980 inaugural . REICH : Wait . If we 're talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if we are also telling the story of investing in America , that implies a more centralized government . How do we square the two ? FRANK : It 's contradictory ; you 're right . That 's why empowerment does n't work . The voters hear that word and think feminism and race . BARBER : They can both work if you use the integrating theme of interdependence . Issue a Declaration of Interdependence . Individuals are interdependent . Communities are interdependent . Now interdependence is the reality , even globally . BABBITT : The most interesting example of a populist movement is the environment . It is a cause that has departed Washington and is now taking root in neighborhoods and communities . It 's a populist and local issue . States all over this country are way ahead of Washington , D.C. In fact , Washington is reactionary compared to the states . FRANK : Empowerment works on the municipal or state level . It is harder to sell on the federal level without becoming very antigovernment . BABBITT : That 's not true . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populist ? It relates to what economists call externalities , the hidden costs we all bear . These are local issues that sweep everybody up in a sense of common benefit . The civil-rights movement was one : a national populist concern . We Democrats must free up community power to handle issues where there are common benefits to which everybody can be awakened . FRANK : I agree . But I 'm not talking about beating the Republicans on many of these issues , only tying them . Someone in 1984 said the Democratic party had a whole that was smaller than the sum of its parts . If we go program by program , we win . So I say we tie them on the values , move on to programs , and beat ' em . BARBER : If you equalize , you do n't necessarily neutralize . You ca n't just say , " Yeah , we believe that , too . " You 've got to provide an alternative story . Take crime . You could just echo the Republican position of being tough . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminals you deal with tough . Put ' em m jail . But what about tomorrow 's criminals ? They are today 's dropouts . And the day-after-tomorrow 's criminals are today 's second-graders who see the older boys selling crack on the street . What are we doing about tomorrow 's criminals ? " That puts the issue right where we want it ; it 's about tomorrow , about the future , about children , about education . It fits into an overall vision , in a context , and does n't just sound like imitation Republicanism.
