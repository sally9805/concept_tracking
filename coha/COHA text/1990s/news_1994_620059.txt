<p> HAITI AND THE WAY TO TRUE DEMOCRACY <p> Editor  --  The Jimmy Carter agreement in Haiti , if it sticks , may prove a political victory for President Clinton . It is by no means a step toward democracy in Haiti . How can it be , when the legitimate , elected government of Haiti is not a party to the agreement and never authorized the U.S. to make such huge concessions to the gangsters in the presidential palace ? <p> The U.S. government created the Haitian military early in this century to serve as a loyal pit bull defending U.S. economic interests . Now that the pit bull 's vicious behavior is embarrassing its master , the master is attempting to take the dog to obedience school . Even if this dog could be " retrained "  --  which it ca n't  --  this exercise would have nothing to do with real democracy . True democracy requires , first of all , national sovereignty and , secondly , civilian control over the military . Both these preconditions are effectively torpedoed by the U.S. unilaterally offering a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorization from the legitimate Haitian government . <p> President Aristide has always been a critic of U.S. colonialism , and he ca n't be expected to slip gracefully into the role of a puppet leader confined by overseas masters and mutinous generals . <p> DAVID CONE <p> Richmond <p> . <p> ' MANUALS OF CONDUCT ' <p> Editor  --  This time around , when our experts instruct Haitians in professional military conduct , let 's hope they avoid the oversights made during the 1915-1934 instructional phase . That time , the trainers forgot to tell their pupils that it was wrong to murder voters and union organizers , and even made ethical slips themselves , such as hunting and killing nationalists . <p> Similar pedagogical errors have been made more recently in El Salvador and Guatemala . Has anyone checked the manuals to see if they 've been updated ? <p> LESTER SCHONBRUN <p> Oakland <p> . <p> ' IF YOU BUILD IT . . . ' <p> Editor  --  With the 1994 baseball season officially dead and prospects for more turmoil and ill will next year , serious thought should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league of their own . " With the uncertain and uninviting prospects of a 1995 Major League season of minor league talent and scab labor , with the players ' union broken and many of the quality players in Japan , what is there to lose ? <p> Tapping into the baseball fan 's love of tradition along with the advantages of name recognition , why not recreate vanished local teams staffed by local players , managers and coaches organized in well defined regions ? Would copyright infringement preclude resurrection of a Pacific Coast League , stretching perhaps into Mexico and Canada , including , among others , the Oakland Oaks and San Francisco Seals ? Would it be possible to have a North-Eastern League including the Brooklyn Dodgers , New York Giants and Boston Braves ? Would it be possible to have a South-Eastern League with teams from Havana and the Dominican Republic ? Would it not do honor to the legacy of the vanished Negro League to have such names as the Kansas City Monarchs and Birmingham Barons raised up again ? <p> What would be the structure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a World Series ? Clearly such an undertaking would take time , effort and money , all of which are per haps in adequate supply if interested parties start the process now . If you build it , we will come ! <p> MICHAEL COOPER <p> Lafayette <p> . <p> GRASS-ROOTS TRIUMPH <p> Editor  --  As someone who volunteered many hours to collect over 1,000 signatures for Proposition 186 , I take issue with Jerry Roberts ' assertion ( Chronicle , September 10 ) that the drive to get this initiative on the ballot was not a grass-roots effort . In a record 100 days , the campaign gathered over 1 million signatures  --  more than half from volunteers . <p> Here in San Francisco , volunteers gathered over 60,000 signatures . Too bad The Chronicle did n't report on the well-run San Francisco campaign that saw 50 volunteers show up each Saturday and Sunday to collect clipboards , petitions and ironing boards  --  it would have made it a lot easier for us . The almost total lack of media coverage meant that we had to explain the initiative over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a special- interest initiative . It has the endorsement of such respected and disinterested groups as the California League of Women Voters and Consumer 's Union . The California Teachers Association and California Federation of Teachers are supporters , although they already have a good health plan . But their interest , and the interest of the other unions , senior groups , nurses ' groups and church groups that support the initiative , is to have a decent , sustainable , health-care system , not just for themselves but for all Californians . <p> DAVID FAIRLEY <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> THE NEW UNTOUCHABLES <p> Editor  --  Do a majority of Californians really believe that it would be permitted under the Constitution to brand as untouchables an entire category of human beings ? Proposition 187 , denying education and health services to illegal immigrants , would do that . <p> Who is callous enough to stand in a school door and say to a child who wants to learn English , " Go away ! We want you to stay ignorant . We want you to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unskilled illiterates who ca n't contribute to a productive society . " Who is so short- sighted as to believe that , in deliberate policy , we should say to that child and the child 's family , stricken or injured , " Be off ! Go bleed and suffer out of my sight ! " <p> Illegal immigration is a serious problem , but are we so paranoid , and our politicians so demagogic , that we are reverting to the periods when Californians persecuted the Miwoks and the Pomos , called the Chinese " the Yellow Peril , " harassed the Irish and the " Okies , " called the Filipinos " gooks " and interned Americans of Japanese descent ? <p> If the voters make November 8 a day of infamy , I hope the courts rebuke them . <p> JOHN N. HUTCHISON <p> Sebastopol <p> . <p> YOUR PAPERS , PLEASE <p> Editor  --  The advocates for illegal " immigrants " are at it again , whining that if Proposition 187 passes , teachers and medical care workers will be forced to become " snitches " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking , speak with an accent or dress differently will be targeted . <p> Not so ! At schools , every parent , regardless of accent , color of skin or attire , will probably be asked to show their Social Security number , driver 's license and the child 's birth certificate . Copies will be made and submitted to the INS for verification . Those without documents will be given time to do so . <p> Prop . 187 has a provision that penalizes those with false documents . Prop . 187 will slow down fraudulent documents . You can help by voting for it . <p> BOB BYSTRICKY <p> Sunnyvale <p> . <p> ICE CHALET 'S FUTURE <p> Editor  --  In response to The Chronicle 's August 5 article , " New Woes for San Mateo 's Ghost Mall , " it is important to note that as owners of the Fashion Island Ice Chalet , we are deeply committed to the loyal customers who skate at our ice rink . As one of the only ice skating facilities in the San Francisco area , we have enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island for many years . <p> We are very interested in the development plans for the mall and would like to see businesses return to the property . Our own future plans include an expansion of our recreational business , adding new elements to our rink such as an expanded pro shop . We also are working to develop a semi-permanent outdoor roller/in-line skating facility . With the soaring popularity of roller-blading and roller-hockey , we believe this venture will be extremely successful . The Ice Chalet has seen continued success since opening in September 1981 . We have enjoyed our 13 years here and look forward to many more profitable years both for Ice Chalet and for Fashion Island . <p> CAROLE KRECHMAN <p> SHELDON KRECHMAN <p> A.F.

Fortunately for the West Coast , we can all be thankful for The Chronicle and Carl Nolte . <p> CHARLES E. CARLEN <p> Twain Harte ( Tuolumne County )
