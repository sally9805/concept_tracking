What to expect : Small-company shares could return 12% , outdistancing the S &P; 500 by two percentage points . What to do : Look for issues with projected gains of 20% to 50% to land your portfolio firmly on the green . Investors who hope to beat par this year ought to concentrate on their small-capitalization growth-stock game . As the MONEY forecast on page 26 points out , 1995 is a year when growth stocks  --  those with annual earnings rising 15% or more that perform well in a slowing economy  --  are likely to lead the way . What 's more , growth stocks with a total market value of less than $1 billion may do best of all . Reason : Small-cap stocks are already expected to surpass their large-cap counterparts ( those worth $5 billion or more ) in ' 95 , returning 12% , compared with 10% for the S &P; 500 . And if the Republican-led Congress delivers on a promised capital-gains tax cut , small stocks would get an added boost  --  since virtually all of their return comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate , the six diminutive growth companies featured here  --  including Callaway Golf , maker of the popular Big Bertha clubs shown on page 71  --  could add a 20% to 50% lift to your small-stock holdings in ' 95 . Of course , the small-cap market is dotted with sand traps ; these issues are generally about a third more volatile than blue chips . So to help keep you out of trouble , we chose only companies that met these three criteria : 1 ) a market capitalization of more than $250 million , because companies smaller than that are even more volatile ; 2 ) a price-to-earnings ratio that is lower than the firm 's projected earnings growth , since a P/E in that range usually signals a bargain even if it is slightly higher than the market 's average P/E ( now 15 ) ; and 3 ) projected 1995 earnings growth of at least 20% but no higher than 50% , because stocks that grow that fast are liable to sudden crashes if their actual earnings fall short of expectations . We then consulted more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picks that met these criteria . The six most promising selections  --  from a mirror maker to a coupon creator  --  are listed in descending order of predicted 1995 price appreciation . Now , do n't say we did n't warn you : As small-cap stocks , even these issues can be plenty jumpy . But if you 're willing to play through some hazards , they could power this portion of your stock portfolio to 20% to 50% gains in 1995 . Gentex ( CNTX ) NASDAQ ; $23.50 Projected return : 45% to 50% The future looks bright for this Zeeland , Mich. manufacturer of rear- and side-view car mirrors that automatically darken to adjust to headlight glare . Sales of the firm 's patented Night Vision Safety Mirror ( shown at left ) are expected to grow 30% in 1995 , as the electronically controlled mirrors become available on about 90 models , up from 75 models last year . The mirror is offered by all three major U.S. car makers as well as BMW , Mercedes-Benz and Nissan . Although the $90 million firm owns a commanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has miles of room to grow : Just 2% of the 44 million cars made worldwide in ' 94 had Gentex mirrors . To help ensure earnings growth , the company is cutting costs  --  reducing the number of coating layers needed for each mirror from four to three , for example  --  which could slice production expenses by 20% within two years . That 's one reason why Tom Galvin , an automotive analyst at C.J. Lawrence/Deutsche Bank Securities , expects a 30% gain in ' 95 earnings . The stock currently trades at a P/E of 18.8 , well below Galvin 's projected growth rate . If the gap between the two closes over the next couple of years , as he expects , the stock could double in price by ' 96 and gain 45% to 50% in the year ahead . Littelfuse ( LFUS ) NASDAQ ; $25.25 Projected return : 30% to 40% Even if you wind up buying Littelfuse stock , there 's a good chance it wo n't be your first investment in this Des Plaines , Ill. manufacturer of  --  you guessed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million company has 55% of the U.S. market for such devices in electronic gear like , perhaps , your laptop computer , CD player or camcorder . It also commands a 95% share of worldwide sales of blade-type automotive fuses . And there may be even more Littelfuse products in your future : Today 's cars come with as many as 70 fuses  --  compared with just a dozen a few years ago  --  and the number could reach 90 by the end of the decade . " The increasing sophistication of electronics and automobiles will mean more demand for circuit protection , and that 's right up Littelfuse 's alley , " says Alexander Paris , president of the investment firm Barrington Research Associates . Paris expects the company 's reported earnings to grow 20% in 1995 to $1.41 per share . The real earnings will be even higher . Littelfuse is still amortizing costs associated with the demise of its parent company , Tracor Holdings , which went bankrupt in 1991 and spun off its profitable Littelfuse division into a separate entity . Those costs depress the firm 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once that 50c is added back in , the stock 's P/E clocks in at a very attractive 13 , instead of 18 . With demand and earnings both growing sharply , Paris foresees a 1995 price gain of 30% or more . Nautica ( NAUT ) NASDAQ ; $28.25 Projected return : 30% to 35% Its clothes may be casual , but there 's nothing laid back about the future prospects for $230 million Nautica Enterprises of New York City . With leisure wear increasingly in demand for both play and work  --  many Fortune 500 firms now have dress-down days , for example  --  sales of Nautica 's classy , boldly colored men 's garb are expected to grow by 17% to $270 million in the coming year . And the company , which also makes swimming and sailing clothes , is expanding rapidly . About 1,500 branches of major department store chains such as Dillard 's , May 's and Macy 's already carry the Nautica line . Analysts expect another 30 branches to introduce Nautica this year and 70 existing sales spaces to be renovated and expanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also set up shop in nine more of the nation 's 324 outlet malls ( it already operates in 28 ) ; that move alone could generate a third of anticipated revenue growth . Gary Pilgrim , manager of the top-rated PBHG Growth Fund ( one of the small-cap funds we recommend in the story beginning on page 34 ) , expects Nautica 's earnings to grow 28% for the fiscal year that ends in February 1996 , well above its current P/E of 15 . " With that sort of valuation , it 's easy to foresee this stock gaining 30 in ' 95 , " he adds . Callaway Golf ( ELY ) NYSE ; $38.25 Projected return : 25% to 30% True , this Carlsbad , Calif. golf club maker 's $1.3 billion market capitalization is just a little long of the conventional $1 billion limit for small-cap firms . But we 'll raise the bar a bit to make room for it . After all , Callaway 's stock  --  whose symbol is named after founder Ely Callaway  --  has been knocked down 13% during the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity for a vigorous company . In 1991 , Callaway became the first manufacturer to put a hollow stainless-steel head on a so-called metalwood club , the metal-and-graphite constructions that are fast replacing traditional wooden-headed clubs . When golfers discovered that this design helped them hit longer and straighter shots , Big Bertha grew to dominate the U.S. market . In ' 94 , for instance , Bertha accounted for more than 50% of the estimated $500 million in " wood " sales . Callaway 's stock took flight too , increasing sevenfold in the two years after the company went public in February 1992 . That oversize gain triggered a pair of two-for-one stock splits . But the stock has sagged from its May 1994 high point of $43.25 ( adjusted for splits ) as some analysts have recommended short sales of Callaway and investors have shifted allegiance to superhot iron manufacturer Cobra Golf , also based in Carlsbad . Analysts who follow Callaway closely suggest the naysayers ought to pay more attention to the action in the pro shops . In the third quarter of ' 94 , Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period a year ago . And Callaway 's new line of Big Bertha irons  --  take that , Cobra !  --  brought in 25% of the company 's third-quarter revenues . " Callaway has proved it can continue to be an innovator , " says Shelly Hale Young , consumer product analyst at the investment bank Hambrecht &; Quist in San Francisco . Big Bertha still has plenty of territory to conquer : Young calculates that its woods are missing from 90% of the world 's golf bags ( and with an estimated 47 million golfers , that 's a lot of bags ) . She expects earnings to rise 25% in ' 95 , carrying the stock  --  now trading at a relatively cheap P/E of 15  --  to a gain of 25$ or more . Catalina Marketing ( POS ) NYSE ; $53.25 Projected return : 25% to 30% Forget Sunday newspaper inserts . When it comes to direct marketing , this $115 million St. Petersburg firm is at the head of the line  --  the supermarket line , that is . Catalina 's Checkout Coupon system , installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are digging for cash to pay their tabs . But the coupons are n't to help shave your bill ; instead , they 're intended to shape your future purchases . If you just bought a six-pack of Pepsi , for example , the machine might cough up a Coca-Cola coupon , assuming that Coke is among Catalina 's paying clients that month ( and Pepsi is not ) . " Packaged-goods manufacturers fighting for market share love this sort of ultratargeted direct marketing , " says Jack Laporte , manager of two smallcap growth funds at T. Rowe Price . The firm 's new Checkout Direct system , installed in 2,000 stores , is even smarter . If you are among the 10 million customers at those stores who pay using a check-cashing card , credit card or other means of identification , the system keeps track of your spending habits . If it learns that you buy ketchup on every fourth visit , for instance , it will spit out a ketchup coupon on your visit No. 3 . As you might expect , the redemption rate for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as high as 20% , us. 1% to 3% . Thanks to such high-tech gear and its own savvy marketing ( even its ticker symbol , POS , is marketing jargon for " point of sale " ) , Catalina has become one of Wall Street 's darlings , trading at 22 times projected earnings for its next fiscal year . But Laporte , who sees earnings growing at 25% a year , says " there 's no reason the stock wo n't appreciate in line with its growth rate . " Ring up a projected 25% gain in 1995 . Bed Bath &; Beyond ( BBBY ) NASDAQ ; $26.75 Projected return : 18% to 23% This retailer has become a mecca for shoppers on the prowl for brand-name home furnishings and appliances . Step through the doors of one of its 61 stores in 17 states and you may find yourself on a sales floor nearly as big as two football fields . Arrayed there is a dizzying quantity of merchandise , ranging from designer shower curtains to toaster ovens to picture frames . The choice is tremendous  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are typically 20% to 40% lower than those at department stores . With that combination of supplies and demand , the $432 million Springfield , N.J. retailer can look forward to 27% earnings growth next year , says Beth Heming , a specialty retail analyst at the brokerage Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis . True , the company 's stock fell 25% during 1994 amid concerns that its inventories were too high . But Heming is n't ready to throw in the towel . Excess inventory , if any , will vanish into the five new stores the firm plans to open by early 1995 , and she expects the stock to gain 18% to 23% in 1995 . That would make this one stock suitable for framing . <p>
