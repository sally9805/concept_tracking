C. GUS DUPINE set his thermos within easy reach , dumped the day 's mail on top of the student papers and unopened publishers ' announcements that formed a steadily rising mound on the floor of his office , and opened his copy of Henry James 's little-read first novel , Watch and Ward . He turned to the part where Roger hears a pistol shot in a hotel room adjoining his own and runs to investigate : <p> In the middle of the floor lay a man , in his trousers and shirt , his head bathed in blood , his hand grasping the pistol from which he had just sent a bullet through his brain . Beside him stood a little girl in her nightdress , her long hair on her shoulders , shrieking and wringing her hands . <p> Except that the dead man came from St. Louis and was in desperate need of ready money , little was known about him . Earlier that evening he had accosted Roger and asked for $100 , which had n't been given . His " foppish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him look like a gambler down on his luck . The girl turned out to be his daughter . The story turned out to be about her and Roger . The body was forgotten . None of it sounded like Henry James . <p> Leaning back in his chair , Dupine tapped out a Chesterfield and stared at the ascending smoke . He could n't remember what the father of James 's next orphan heroine , Isabel Archer , had died of , and when he looked into his worn copy of The Portrait of a Lady , he saw that James 's handling of Mr. Archer 's death was full of vague insinuations . Isabel remembered her father as a generous and debonair parent ( the word handsome came up twice ) , who shielded her from the unspecified troubles that finally overwhelmed him , but others who knew him better remained bitterly unforgiving . Evidently , he had borrowed recklessly , gambled away his fortune , died insolvent . His last days were so unpleasant he had felt a " general willingness " to leave the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his thermos . All novels , he knew , had to have a vague background for their bright specifics , but why did the shadowy figure that fathered James 's finest heroine have to look so suspiciously like the wretched suicide in Watch and Ward ? <p> Something else was nagging at Dupine  --  the suicide at the end of James 's last published story , " A Round of Visits , " from 1910 . Dupine looked the story up in Volume 12 of James 's complete Tales and started reading . <p> The story begins with Mark Monteith returning to New York after a life in Europe and discovering that he has been swindled by his trustee , an old friend who has vanished . Mystified and depressed , Mark looks up a couple of women he knows in order to confide his troubles , but they seem too caught up in New York 's frantic whirl to listen to him . Turning to a former acquaintance , Newton Winch , a businessman who was never particularly sympatico , Mark finds the man strangely improved . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now shows the cultivated manner , the facial responsiveness , Mark thinks of as European . How could a man who has spent his life on Wall Street achieve such a wonderful transformation ? Then , paying closer attention to the man 's extreme nervousness , Mark figures out something : Newton is facing imminent arrest . Newton , too , is a crook , like Mark 's own trustee , the difference being that Newton is n't running away . Mark even spots a pistol halfway under a chair and guesses that his friend had been contemplating suicide just before the visit . Then a knock is heard on the door : the police . Mark leaves the room to let them in , and as he does so he hears a pistol go off behind him and then the sound of a fall . He rushes back . Newton has shot himself in the temple . He lies on the floor , his newly expressive face upturned and disfigured . <p> As if something were careening around inside his own temples , Professor Dupine let the story drop to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long minutes he was a waxy , unblinking corpse , and then he raised himself and reached for his thermos . He took a drink . He thought about the moustaches , the vulgar good looks , the forgotten corpses in the two early novels , the spotlighted suicide on the last page of the last story , and the remarkable transformation of Newton Winch . He thought about the other transformation : how the cheap scoundrel of 1871 in Watch and Ward became a finely responsive Jamesian gentleman by 1910 . <p> Dupine 's heart pounded . He knew . He knew . Somewhere in the writer 's early life there absolutely had to be a body  --  a disfigured charmer who would not stay buried  --  a corpse that bothered James enormouslya ghost . Dupine sprang from his chair . It had been a long wait . Finally he had another case . <p> Remembering Milly Theale in The Wings of the Dove , who comes from a large , rich , and glamorously wild New York family in which everyone has managed to die , though no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dupine reached for his copy of the memoirs James wrote in old age , A Small Boy &; Others . There James characterized the history of his father 's many brothers and sisters as a " chronicle of early deaths , arrested careers , broken promises , orphaned children . " But instead of filling in the chronicle 's names and dates , James conveyed the impression that nothing had ever been explained to him and that he was still as mystified as ever : " ! see even young brides , as well as young grooms , originally so formed to please and to prosper ... , vanish untimely , become mysterious and legendary , with such unfathomed silences and significant headshakes . " Surely James could have furnished a few details if he had wanted to . <p> And what about the other members of the James family : did they leave anything on record about all those mysterious deaths ? Dupine got out his copy of the 1920 edition of William James 's letters that had been edited by his son , Henry James III . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what had now become the ancestors : <p> Most of them were blessed with a liberal allowance of that combination of gayety , volubility , and waywardness which is popularly conceded to the Irish ; but these qualities , which made them " charming " and " interesting " to their contemporaries , did not keep them from dissipating both respectable talents and unusual opportunities .... The personalities and histories of that generation . . . impressed Henry and William James . . . like a richly colored social kaleidoscope , dashed , as the patterns changed and disintegrated , with amusing flashes of light and occasional dark moments of tragedy . <p> Very interesting , thought Dupine . A tragicomic kaleidoscope . But no freeze-frames . No close-ups . Not a single detail . <p> Dupine grabbed his worn copy of The ames Family by F. O. Matthiessen . He got out Leon Edel 's biography of Henry James . He got out the biographies of other members of the James family by Austin Warren , Howard M. Feinstein , Jean Strouse , Jane Maher . There was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balancing his cigarette on the edge of Edel 's biography , which had numerous burns , the professor unearthed his copy of Katharine Hastings ' 1924 genealogy of the James family and started counting . James had ten aunts and uncles on his father 's side who survived infancy . Only three reached old age  --  William , who died at seventy ; Augustus , fiftynine ; and Howard , fifty-eight . The other seven all died between the ages of twenty-three and forty . Of these , four died after young Henry James had grown old enough to notice . Four deaths that could have got stuck in that absorbent little mind . Four sets of " unfathomed silences and significant headshakes . " <p> When Aunt Ellen died , James was six . When Aunt Catharine died , he was eleven . And when John Barber and Edward died , both in 1856 , he was thirteen . Edward did n't marry . John Barber did , fathering a boy and a girl . His wife died when Henry James was only two . As far as little Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , in this respect resembling the little girl in Watch and Ward and Isabel in The Portrait of a Lady . <p> Dupine lit another Chesterfield from what was left of the previous one . He took long , deep inhalations . He coughed . None of it figured . Here you have one of the richest families in the country , able to buy the best medical advice there was , and they were virtually wiped out . <p> Checking the index in F. W. Dupee 's one-volume edition of James 's A Small Boy &; Others and Notes of a Son and Brother , Dupine saw that John Barber was mentioned more than the other uncles or aunts . " J.J. " was how James sometimes referred to John Barber . J.J. was one of the " Albany uncles , " and he liked to take the train to New York , get " tipsy , " live expansively . In 1848 , when the barricades went up in Paris , it was J.J. who informed the two Henry Jameses , father and son , that King Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he died . The cause of death was n't given , but the last thing James had to say about J.J. was what you would expect to see on a tombstone . It was a final tribute , a last hail and farewell to an old , cherished , tragic ghost : " J.J. the elder , most loved , most beautiful , most sacrificed of the Albany uncles . " <p> Dupine sat in his dusty , windowless office and palmed his bristly cheek . No sound reached him from the outside . No light fell except what came from fluorescent tubes . He knew that J.j. was the one , and he reached for his thermos of sour mash . <p> Wiping his glasses , Dupine returned to James 's memoirs , to the two lengthy passages that concerned J.J. Both were extremely elusive and suggestive in the Jamesian way . Dupine 's eyes bore in like power augurs . <p> In the first passage James remembered traveling by rail in the care of three uncles-J.J. , Edward , and Augustus . They were riding in an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Railroad was built , circa 1850 . Were they going from New York to Rhinebeck , to visit Augustus ? Was there only one trip or had there been several ? James the memoirist could n't say , but he did recollect his glimpses of the great river , the interminable stops , his " young fatigue , " " the heat and the glare , " . " the sense of arrival forever postponed . " What he chiefly remembered was the presence of uncles , incoherent Albany uncles .... I see them always , the relatives , in slow circulation ; restless and nervous and casual their note , not less than strikingly genial , but with vaguenesses , lapses , eclipses .... They cheered us on , in their way ; born optimists , clearly , if not logically determined ones , they were always reassuring and sustaining , though with a bright brevity that must have taken immensities , I think , for granted . They wore their hats slightly toward the nose , they strolled , they hung about , they reported of progress and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packets of the edible deprecated for the immature ; they figured in fine to a small nephew as the principal men of their time and , so far as the two younger and more familiar were concerned , the most splendid as to aspect and apparel . <p> The two younger and more familiar and most splendidly featured and appareled uncles were J.J. and Edward . They must have been rather dazzling , particularly since they clearly did n't let the job of tending their serious-minded nephew interfere with their pleasure . Kind , reassuring , indulgent , whatever , they definitely enjoyed themselves . Check up on the boy , boost his drooping spirits , nip off for a drink : that sort of thing . Smart as he was , the boy did n't quite understand their kind of fun but he was lastingly impressed by their raked hats and genial , careless ways . <p> Something tickled Dupine 's memory , and he took a second look at the description of Isabel 's father in The Portrait of a Lady . There it was : the " restlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulgent good nature . <p> In the second passage , James remembered being taken by his father to a stylish shop in New York where something mysterious was insinuated about J.J. and two other uncles . The shop was somewhere near Fourth Street . It was owned by a Mrs. Cannon , and James vividly recalled the unusual approach to her place of business  --  steps descending from the sidewalk : <p> What the steps went down to was a spacious room , light and friendly , ... at once a parlour and a shop , a shop in particular for the relief of gentlemen in want of pockethandkerchiefs , neckties , collars , umbrellas .... Mrs. Cannon was always seated at some delicate white or other needlework , as if she herself made the collars and the neckties and hemmed the pockethandkerchiefs .... The oddity was in many things-above all perhaps in there being no counter , no rows of shelves and no vulgar till for Mrs. Cannon 's commerce . <p> The oddity got cleared up after a few more visits . Mrs. Cannon 's main line of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the little boy 's impression that these gentlemen consisted " principally ... of the ever remarkable Uncles , desirous at times , on their restless returns from Albany or wherever , of an intimacy of comfort that the New York Hotel could n't yield . " James did n't mention the other reason for not staying at a big hotel . Once you signed the register , anyone who bought the next day 's New York Herald would know where you had spent the night . <p> Mrs. Cannon , James remembered , had two women working for her , Miss Maggie and Miss Susie , and as they sat in their rocking chairs with their " poised needles , " hemming the gentlemen 's pocket-handkerchiefs , they joined in the talk about " Mr. John and Mr. Edward and Mr. Howard . " What interested the boy was " that the uncles were somehow always under discussion  --  as to where they at the moment might be , or as to when they were expected , or above all as to how ( the ' how ' was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last appeared . " <p> Shrewd kid , thought Dupine , already tracking the big adult mysteries nobody would explain . Scarcely rid of his lisp and his mind already spinning at warp speed . Why were Papa and the three stitchers so anxious about how J.J. was holding his liquor and where in New York he was holding it ? Dupine lingered over the sentences in which James reconstructed his boyish mystification : " If I did n't understand , however , the beauty was that Mrs. Cannon understood ... and my father understood , and each understood that the other did , Miss Maggie and Miss Susie being no whit behind . It was only ! who did n't understand . " <p> That was in 1854 . And that was that : nothing more of J.J. 's life and death was to be gleaned from his nephew 's carefully edited memories . The rest was up to Dupine , who had not done any real outside work for years-getting on the phone , writing letters , traveling to archives . There were thousands and thousands of James family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sources in Albany , Schenectady , New York . If you wanted to solve a case like this , you had to move . You had to go after travel and research money , and then you had to get off your butt and put in the kind of footwork that left you with a hole in your shoe leather and a fresh set of bunions and a new respect for your old worn-out slippers and chair . <p> But first came the obituaries . The professor refilled his thermos , hid it under his trench coat , and walked to the library at the center of the gigantic state university that had made the mistake of tenuring him . He took the elevator to microforms and found the boxed reels of the Chicago Tribune . J.J. died May 22 , 1856 . A Thursday . The morning paper for Friday or Saturday should have the report of his death . <p> But Friday 's paper was missing from the microfilm . So was Saturday 's . And Monday 's . In fact , there was nothing at all between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ceased publication for the interval . There were other big gaps , too . <p> Dupine struck himself on the temple . Of course . Most Chicago newspaper files had been destroyed by the fire , and not only that but the coroners ' reports would have also gone up in smoke.Try the New York papers . <p> Nothing in the Times . Nothing in the Herald . And in Horace Greeley 's New York Tribune for May 26 , there was only this , sandwiched among thirteen brief death notices : <p> JAMES  --  at Chicago , on Thursday , May 22 , John B. James o Albany , aged 40 years . <p> Without warning , the gray metal walls of Dupine 's microfilm reader took on the appearance of a blind alley . He vividly saw himself in perspective , diminishing , and at the same time he felt a distracting regret , as if something of incalculable value had been left behind and he could n't remember what it was . He looked around to see if the head of microforms was running her usual stakeout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against drinking in the library , and then he eased his thermos out of his inside pocket and poured down as much as he needed . <p> Against all odds , Dupine received a modest travel grant . Spring break arrived , and students headed south for a week of sun , beer , and sex on Padre Island , and the professor stowed his thermos in his filing cabinet , locked his office door , took a shuttle to the airport , and flew off on his quest . The libraries on his itinerary were open , the librarians were more forthcoming than he deserved , and the thread of inquiry and evidence he was following kept going and going as if it would never break , running through old letters and diaries and wills and city directories and census records and microfilmed newspapers . He kept his eye on the thread and tried not to be distracted by the chaotic frazzle of facts he inevitably turned up . Any real investigation , he reminded himself , is always full of loose ends . All scholar-gumshoes end up with unanswered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago ? Was he carrying a gun ? Who was the woman ? That sort of thing . <p> Dupine got his first break at Harvard . He 'd been reading an endless number of James family letters without finding anything to the purpose when it finally dawned on him that the most promising source of information would probably be Henry James III . It was he-and by the way , Dupine wondered , did the Jameses think they were kings of England or France , using the same name over and over ?  --  it was Henry III , the novelist 's nephew , who inherited the family papers and eventually gave them to Harvard . He was the self-appointed family archivist , and he was so strong on facts that he complained to his uncle about the distortions in his memoirs . Henry III was a lawyer , a trustee , an expert on actuarial science , and a president of TIAA ( Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association ) , the nonprofit corporation that tended teachers ' pensions ( including Professor Dupine 's trifling nest egg ) . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insurance men do not cover up suicides . <p> Dupine requested every document remotely connected with James 's nephew , and in less than two hours he had his piece of paper . It was an ordinary sheet of typing paper , double-spaced , with the heading " John B. James , " and it probably dated from the late teens or early twenties . <p> John James was much beloved by his brothers and sisters and was spoken of as the handsome man of the family . His good looks seem to have been considered remarkable and are almost the only point about him that seems to be definitely remembered .... The daguerreotypes hardly bear this out . His face is amiable and sensitive , but weak . What my mother remembers hearing about him would indicate that he was a spendthrift and gambled too freely for the good of his fortune . Ultimately he killed himself. 1 <p> Dupine wanted to jump up and lift his arms in victory . He wanted to brandish a fist , like George Bush , and snarl a little . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had broken on Henry James 's stunned vision at the age of thirteen ! <p> The professor tried to Calm himself . The dirty work of unearthing J.J. 's story had hardly begun . No self-respecting gumshoe could rest his case on a single piece of hearsay . J.J. had got himself dead twenty-three years before Henry III got himself alive , and no matter how good you are at tallying births and deaths and guarding other people 's money , you 're not going to know very much about a great-uncle you 've never seen . <p> Dupine called the Cambridge bus station , and before long he was sitting in an express headed east along the Massachusetts Turnpike . Outside his streaky window there was a beautiful late spring landscape , with millions of fertile maple whirligigs drifting down against a backdrop of dark green white pines . He got off in Schenectady and went straight to the Union College archives and special collections . Did they have anything on John Barber James , class of 18347 <p> They did . In J.J. 's day Union College had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private journals with tart comments on faculty , students , and alumni . At different times Pearson held the positions of treasurer , librarian , and professor of half a dozen subjects running from philosophy to agriculture . Like Henry III , Pearson was a diligent keeper of private records for future historians . On October 23 , 1854 , J.J. 's twentieth reunion , Pearson drafted a memorandum expressly for Dupine : <p> Being a son of " Billy James " of Albany and having large expectations of wealth it did not seem necessary that he should exert himself to become a student . <p> He has lived what is called a genteel life in N.Y . and Albany without any business. : <p> Pearson did n't know the half of it . After J.J. came into his share of Billy James 's huge fortune , he bought a Hudson Valley estate that was said to be the handsomest site on the river . It was called Linwood , and J.J. filled its grounds with fancy roses. 3 He had so much fun with his money that in 1844 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own extravagant outlays , he reminded his mother how fast J.J. had been living . <p> Still , Dupine whispered to Pearson 's ghost , you do n't want to waste too much envy on J.J. His wife died in 1846 , when they were both only thirty , and it was n't long before he had to unload Linwood and the roses . Where did J.J. go next ? Dupine handed Pearson 's journals and J.J. 's vertical file back to the archivist , bid her a brusque farewell , and caught the number 55 bus to nearby Albany , getting off in front of the city library . His luck held . Not only was he given free run of the locked local-history room , but he found a complete set of Hoffman 's old city directories . The one for 1848 , the first with a listing for J.J. , gave his residence as 45 North Pearl Street , and this , . Dupine quickly discovered , was his widowed mother 's home  --  clearly a safe harbor for a widower with two small children . Later directories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life . <p> So what does a wealthy man do all day long after moving back to his mother 's home ? <p> One thing he did was to join the Albany Gallery of the Fine Arts and help foot the bill for the third annual exhibition of paintings . He also paid fifty dollars for a life membership in the Albany Young Men 's Association for Mutual Improvement , which had a members ' library and sponsored winter lectures , and he gave twenty-five dollars to the same organization 's Committee on Rooms and Fixtures. 4 Clearly , J.J. did his bit for culture and deep carpets . Could this be the same out-of-control bon vivant who was too fond of taking the train to New York ? <p> And what did John Barber 's mama think of her beautiful , idle boy , the one child who carried her maiden name ? <p> Dupine stuffed his notes in his sorry-looking briefcase and left for the Surrogate 's Court , where , after an interminable runaround , he finally got his hands on a copy of Catharine Barber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1847 . The executor proved to be J.J. , which made sense . Mama James would naturally feel better having her executor close at hand . Still , it was a surprise to see that when she added a codicil seven years later , on September 7 , 1854 , she did n't replace J.J. By that time , surely , the rest of the family knew that this man could not be trusted with money . <p> Earlier Dupine had found a family letter written by J.J. 's oldest brother William soon after Mama signed her codicil . " Poor Uncle John is down again  --  but better last night . ' " 5 Was " down " Victorian for " drunk " ? If so , did Mama know ? They were worried about J.J. in 1854 and 1855 . Off in New York City , Henry James 's father was having his regular anxious sessions with Mrs. Cannon and Miss Maggie and Miss Susie . They were thinking J.J. might be headed for a smash-up , and little Henry had his antennae out and waving , and before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at 43 North Pearl Street , Catharine Barber James kept J.J. on as her executor . Maybe she did n't know about him . Maybe in her eyes he was reliable , stable , solid ; a pillar , a rock . <p> Dupine 's mind was humming now . So much to suspect , so little to go on , and only one more repository to check out before leaving Albany-the New York State Library . As he shuffled across the Empire State Plaza , crackling with midsummer heat , he tried and failed to bring John Barber James into focus . There were several different images , and they would n't come together : the responsible patron of the arts ; the loving , dependable son ; the reckless , high-living man about town . <p> At the State Library , Dupine rode up to the eleventh floor and pushed the buzzer for admission to the special collections reading room . He signed in , had the paging procedures explained to him , and pulled out the card catalog drawer for the letter " J. " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some of the more famous members of the family . Was little Henry right ? Was he one of the principal men of his time ? No , hardly ; what they had on him were only some private financial records , chiefly something called " Ledger of the Real and Personal Estate belonging to the Estate of John B. James . " According to the catalog card , this item consisted of nothing but a list of stocks and rental payments . Dupine had it paged anyway . <p> It turned out to be two volumes  --  one a ledger , the other a cash book  --  both bound in decomposing leather that left Dupine 's fingers yellowed and furry feeling . These were the books that went with J.J. 's estate . They 'd been kept by his trustee , James Dexter , and the entries began within a week after J.J. 's death . Dupine 's heart skipped a beat . <p> First came an itemized schedule of the real and personal property J.J. died owning : four four-story brick warehouses on the Albany waterfront , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big warehouse in Syracuse , a share of the family salt-works in that city , two lots in New York , a few square miles of land in Illinois , and much more . All this was his share of what had been put together by his father , old Billy James of Albany , who had been worth $1,300,000 at his death in 1832 . <p> Dupine raked through Mr. Dexter 's meticulous record of payments . $22 for proving the will . $72.50 for " Coffin etc , Chicago . " $98.95 to the New York State Bank to cover an " overdraft by J. B. James . " $193.92 to a Chicago hotel . How many days did that last represent ? Doing what ? Trying to turn his Illinois properties into ready cash ? <p> Dupine 's eyes skipped down the columns and his heart raced . If the life he 'd been imagining had ever been lived , the evidence had to be in this moldy old cash book . Pay attention , he told himself . Be like Henry James . Do n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3.50 for legal notices . $3 fee " on appointment of Guardian . " The guardian was for one or both of J.J.

's turn to go to pieces , an act he performed in an expensive private asylum selected by his maternal grandfather , a doctor in New York . Think of the silent headshakes . This was the sort of thing Henry James remembered and chose not to mention when he wrote the family memoirs . Then John V. died , one day after his twenty-third birthday , and that was the end of a " very charming boy , " as James told his nephew half a century later , according to Houghton Library manuscript Am 1092.9 ( 4600 ) folder 14 .

Checking his watch , Dupine jumped up , returned the musty ledgers to the librarian on duty at the desk , and hurried out . There was just enough time to check the Albany directories one last time before the city library closed for the night , and every now and then he broke into an old man 's mutilated trot as he made his way a second time across the endless Empire State Plaza , which had been emptied of its usual loungers by the threat of a late-summer thunderstorm . Phrases of the article he would write flashed like heat lightning through his head . " Isabel Archer 's stubborn fondness for the dead father others vilify . . .

The Jameses were in the opposite camp .

Dupine whipped through the pages of the Albany city directories for the 1850s , as if he too had a sudden irrepressible thirst for the nearest gambling hell , and hoped against hope that he would n't find the names he was looking up.Neither man was listed . <p> A few seconds later one of the harried librarians on the main floor , who have to try to answer every last question that walks in off the street , was asked by a faded old man with glittering eyes when the next night train left for New York City . <p> If J.J. had been required to spend a night in Dupine 's dingy room on the ninth floor of the 63rd Street YMCA , he would have assumed he was in a penitentiary rather than a hotel . Dupine did n't give his depressing cell a second thought , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clean , October breeze as he walked north along Central Park West the next morning on his way to the New-York Historical Society . <p> When he got inside the cramped room assigned to the manuscript division , the first thing he had paged was a file of materials on the James family of Albany . He flipped through the papers so rapidly he caused a creased legal document to break in two , and then he came upon some letters from J.J. to James King of Albany . James King was J.J. 's attorney ( also his brother-in-law ) , and the letters , written in a large , free , flowing hand , were about " business . " It looked like J.J. was chronically short of cash even while living like a prince . On December 4 , 1839 , he sent James King an order from his expensive Rhinebeck estate : <p> My Pokeepsie note becomes payable on 2 May 1840 . The whole amount must then be paid . I depend upon Vedder almost entirely . I wish you would write to him and tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity and that the whole amount must be paid in Albany on the first day of April next . One month can not make a great deal of difference with him g : to me it is a matter of the last importance ? <p> That helped a lot . Vedder would have to pay up a month early so that J.J. would n't be foreclosed . One month could n't make much difference to Vedder , but J.J. , writing from his fine Hudson River property , was desperately counting days . J.J. depended on Vedder almost entirely . Far be it from J.J. , however , to go about the dirty work of writing Vedder himself . No , J.J. 's brother-in-law , on whom J.J. also depended almost entirely , would have to do that . Dupine turned the sheet over and saw , from the postmark , that the letter was mailed two days after it was written . He reread J.J. 's opening excuse for not replying sooner to a " favor " of King 's . " Favor . " The word conveyed an image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad habit of depending on the indulgence of businessmen . Henry III would not have approved of J.J. 's business practices . J.J. would not have worked out at TIAA . <p> Handing the folder of papers back to the manuscript librarian , Dupine hurried downstairs and caught a taxi for the New York Genealogical and Historical Society . He 'd already taken the precaution of becoming a member , and so he had no trouble getting past the gatekeeper and into the locked elevator . The moment he 'd been given a brief orientation by one of the staff , he ascended to the small , plain , high-ceilinged room , where a steel ladder on wheels gave access to lofty steel shelves lined with a complete run of Longworth 's nineteenth-century New York directories . They were in much worse shape than the Albany city directories , and when Dupine was finished with them they had deteriorated a little bit more . The large steel table was flecked with brittle , yellow paper . <p> The first person Dupine looked up was Mrs. Cannon  --  Anne C. Cannon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original business was " made linen , " which she was still selling when the two Henry Jameses , Sr. and Jr. , began visiting her shop in the 1850s , but her main line became " boarding . " Her address was 7 and 9 Waverley Place . With a location like that , Mrs. Cannon had to be a lot more than merely legitimate  --  meaning little Henry James had been one hell of a sharp-eyed observer . He 'd gotten Mrs. Cannon right . <p> Then the gamblers . There was a C. H. Hileman at 85 Spring Street , and the directory for 1854-55 had a Patrick Hearne living at 587 Broadway , between Prince and Houston . But no business was given for either man , The library had nothing on Hileman , but in Volume 3 of the published diary of George Templeton Strong , Dupine found a verse from a hymn that suggested Patrick Hearne had been a person of some notoriety : <p> pre Ye Saints rejoice , give cheerful thanks , For Awful Gardner 's joined your ranks . And , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope for Patrick Hearne ( p. 391 ) . But for Dupine there was only more worry . Was Patrick Hearne the gambler one and the same as the P. L. Hearne of Dexter 's cash book ? Without warning , the professor collapsed in on himself . <p> Then he revived , remembering that in 1855 , when Patrick Hearne lived at 587 Broadway , New York State had taken a census . <p> A librarian got Dupine pointed in the right direction , toward a shelf of microfilmed census ledgers and a guide to New York City 's wards and election districts , and in half an hour he had 587 Broadway , dwelling Number 213 . The residents were a forty-five-year-old man born in Ireland , his American-born wife aged thirty-four , and six servants , two of them illiterate and all Irish . The man of the house identified himself to the census enumerator as P. L. Hearne  --  proving that Patrick and P. L. were the same . Patrick , meaning Irish , was the name of choice with his detractors , but P. L. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick house was worth $16,000 , and as for his profession , that he identified as " gentleman . " <p> Dupine jumped up , running his fingers through his woefully thin hair . Now that he had the identity of the man who had separated helpless J.J. from his money and his life , the professor knew exactly where to turn . He stuffed his notes in his briefcase and rapidly left the Genealogical and Historical Society 's quiet library , and when the agonizingly slow elevator finally set him down at street level , he hailed the first empty taxi heading south . <p> He got out in front of the New York Public Library , where a stiff October wind was kicking up the dead leaves and a raw-faced , thickly bundled woman was poking through a trash container for aluminum cans . Dupine threw back his shoulders and briskly climbed the steps between the great lions , like a gladiator ignorant of the odds . <p> He went to the microfilm reading area and requested the New York Times index for the 1850s , and when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed until he came to the " G 's . " " G " was for Gambling . <p> January 18 , 1856 . Early morning raid on gambling houses , one of them being " Pat Hearne 's . " <p> February 12 , 1856 . Trial of twenty gamblers , including Hearne , who makes a solemn promise to close his gaming-house . His attorney , Daniel Sickles , allows that " Mr. Hearne had been connected with several notorious gambling houses in this City , but when that was said , all was said . No man had ever imputed to him a mean or dishonest act . " Mr. Hearne is let off . <p> Dupine pushed back his chair and headed for the New York Hiso tory room , where he learned that Sickles , the attorney , was definitely big-time , a sachem in Tammany Hall , a state senator . He successfully ran for Congress , and when he murdered the son of Francis Scott Key in 1858 , he was found innocent . When the Civil War broke out he rose to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pieces while defending an advanced position at Gettysburg , and as he waited for the stretcher-bearers and the bone-cutters , he smoked a cigar . He got the Congressional Medal of Honor , and his leg went on exhibit at the Surgical Museum in the nation 's capital. 8 That was the kind of legal artillery Patrick Hearne fought with . <p> Dupine imagined Hearne and Sickles looking over J.J. 's shoulder as he informed his lawyer that he depended almost entirely on a creditor 's generosity : there was a ghostly swirl of cigar smoke and a coarse guffaw . <p> Fearful that someone might have claimed his reader , whose light he had purposely left burning , Dupine hurried back to the ranks of microfilm machines . On June 27 , 1855 , the Jameses sailed from New York to Europe , remaining there for three full years . This was the trip that turned the James children into precocious cosmopolites . What did Henry St. know about New York 's most notorious gambler in the months preceding this momentous departure ? Dupine called for the newspaper the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Tribune . On February 1 , 1855 , there was a long letter to the editor : <p> I notice in your columns that among the gamblers arrested during the past few days ... was Patrick Hearne .... Who would have thought that these huge and impudent gambling establishments were ever going to be assailed ... ? The chief of them are situated in Broadway ... ; they are furnished in the most luxurious and seductive manner ... ; they are fed and fattened and pampered on the tears of broken-hearted fathers and mothers , on the anguish of wives , on the sighs of kindred , on the desolation of all the virtues and pleasant charities that sweeten home . <p> The signature consisted of two letters , H.J. These initials were reserved for the use of just one man by the Tribune 's editor , Horace Greeley , and that man had dusted them off in order to take a roundhouse swing at his brother 's despoiler . There was no doubt about it : H.J. blamed Hearne for what was happening to J.J. , and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V. , was going through  --  the " desolation " of the home . <p> Did it occur to H.J. , as he penned his intemperate letter , that it might bring unforeseen consequences ? Hearne would have every pretext now for blaming his heavy legal expenses on H.J. , whom it would be easy to identify and even easier to wound through his brother . Maybe Hearne decided he would need a little more than his rightful pound of H.J. 's brother 's flesh . Maybe he and his hardball lawyer gave J.J. reason to think he would end up in a cell in Sing-Sing Penitentiary , well within view from the Hudson River Railroad . That would have been sweet revenge against J.J 's tall-talking brother , and what would have made it all the sweeter was that only two years earlier J.J. had been appointed to the board of inspectors at Sing-Sing. 9 <p> Dupine found more : an editorial in the March 12 paper that looked like it , too , would have been signed " H.J. " if it were n't for the Tribune 's policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Worst Society , " and it was full of Henry Sr. 's utopian socialism . Some day we will have perfect spiritual equality , the writer announced , but for now we are in a transition period . The great present evil is " the horde of gamblers , pimps , and ruffians " who infest the city . They are only pimples , however , and they will soon burst and disappear . Anyway , " the awful form of Judge Lynch " looms in the distance , and he will cleanse the city of its impurities . New York will be saved by vigilantism . <p> This had a whiff of extremism , and yet , whoever the editorial writer was , he seemed to be in synch with events . On March 21 the Tribune reported an arrest : <p> Pat . Hearn , one of the most celebrated gamblers in New-York , was apprehended and taken to the Eighth Ward Station-House , where he was detained for the night . Hearn has kept a gambling-house ... for many years , and , according to rumor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pat . is an Irishman , 42 years of age , and is said to be very rich . <p> Two days later , on March 23 , a forceful editorial titled " Mayor Wood and the Gamblers " expressed approval of the new mayor 's anti-vice raids . The editorialist was outraged that Hearne 's house was adjacent to " John Jacob Astor 's old residence , " and he went after the gambler the way a ferret goes for a rat . As far as the editorialist was concerned , Hearne was nothing more than vermin squatting in honored halls , something to be exterminated . Dupine 's nostrils twitched . He was sure he detected Henry James , Sr. 's confrontational and fervently vituperative style . No one had ever attributed " Mayor Wood and the Gamblers " and " Our Best and Worst Society " to the novelist 's father , nor had anyone linked him to Gotham 's erratic vice squads , but Dupine had caught the scent , he sniffed a James , he knew the future novelist 's father had written those editorials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't figure , however . If Henry St. was working to clean up New York and even , unbelievably , having an effect , why would he suddenly abandon the good fight and leave for three years ? Back to the New York History room hurried Dupine , where he found an article on Mayor Fernando Wood . Elected in 1854 , he at first surprised everyone by his reforms . But they were only part of an elaborate game . Although some of the minor gambling houses were closed , " the most profitable and disreputable ... received immunity . " 10 Wood made money in office , and in the end he proved to be one of the city 's all-time crookedest mayors . <p> That would certainly help explain why Henry Sr. resolved to shake New York City 's dust from his feet and never return . Provided he had written those unsigned editorials . <p> Without bothering to rewind his film or even turn off his machine , Dupine grabbed his papers and left . <p> Outside the New York Public Library , where a freezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the thinly clothed form of an old man could be seen descending the great library 's imposing front steps . From the way he was hunched forward , he was apparently giving all his attention to the important job of avoiding a fall , but in fact his mind was far away . Was n't there a box of Henry Sr. 's newspaper clippings and articles at Harvard ? Were n't there some more things by Henry III that had n't been looked at yet ? <p> Dupine could hardly sleep that night in his room at the 63rd Street YMCA . He was troubled by a repetitive dream in which he had to decipher some jumbled words on a microfilm that kept turning before ' his eyes . He constantly lost his place , and his eyes ached , and he needed a drink of water and a good night 's rest . But his attention never flagged , and he struggled all night to make out the words . One of them was hotel . Another was alone . Another was ghost . The vowel sounds , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried him tremendously ; he went over the words again and again , trying to get them right . If he could only read them correctly , history would turn out to be almost entirely different from what it had been . What was over and done with would never come right if it was n't for Dupine . <p> He checked out early the next morning and used his next-to-last traveler 's check for the first train leaving Port Authority for Boston . He spent the trip pressing his fingers against his forehead . Although the room he checked into at the Greater Boston YMCA was cleaner than what he 'd been given in New York , that was all there was to recommend it  --  that and the twenty-eight-dollar charge , with breakfast thrown in . He caught the T and headed for Harvard Square . <p> The reading room at the Houghton Library looked the same as before . Someone was inspecting a collection of old daguerreotypes . Someone else was holding a piece of paper with writing on it up to the light , possibly looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone , trying to get someone to turn up the heat . Dupine appropriated a table , and as he waited for Henry Sr. 's clippings to be brought to him , his unseeing gaze moved along shelves loaded with book catalogs and bibliographical aids and histories of printing . He shivered and put his coat back on . <p> When the boxed clippings11 were set down on Dupine 's table , he ransacked them as fast as he thought he could get away with without causing suspicion . Again , his luck held . Buried among all the reprints of Henry Sr. 's utterly uninteresting controversies with rival followers of Emanuel Swedenborg and Charles Fourier were two long , slender , carefully scissored-out columns from the New York Tribune . One was titled " Our Best and Worst Society , " the other " Mayor Wood and the Gamblers . " Nothing more , but now Dupine knew that the James father had written those fierce jeremiads , and that he 'd done so partly because he was worried sick about a younger brother who was being chewed up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more piece of luck . As Dupine made a second pass through Henry III 's family notes , he turned up the corroborating evidence he had to have . As before , it was a single page . It was headed " John James " in Henry III 's minute and tidy hand . There was a brief prefatory explanation  --  <p> From a letter of Grandfather 's to the Tweedies , written from Paris , Sep . 14  --  1856  --  I copied ( 1911 ) the following reference to the death of his brother John , who had apparently gone to pieces with drink and gambling under the discouragement of a blighted loveaffair and then a long copied excerpt , recording what Henry III had wanted someone , someday , to know : <p> " I do n't think I had ever such a shock as the news of his death . I had been used too to say , he will die unless he stops ; but I always supposed that he would stop . And when at last I heard that he had actually been hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of his youth and his beauty and his wit and his generosity and his genial feeling for all that was noble under the sun , I felt as if my heart must break within me , or that madness would be a relief . He was inexpressibly dear to me . I was proud of him , I was full of hope that with maturity of intellect would come serene and beneficent action : but he has gone , and I have already ceased to complain . " 12 <p> Henry III must have destroyed the letter without making a copy of the rest of it . That would have been the part that named the woman and told how J.J. killed himself . <p> Dupine leaned back . He stared at the document lying on the table . If the report of J.J. 's suicide took roughly ten days to travel across the Atlantic Ocean , it would have reached Henry Sr. around the first of June . He and his wife and five children and servants had just moved into a rented house on the Champs-Elysees , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris and Louisiana . According to a January 11 , 1921 , letter to Henry III from Mary A. Tappan , there was a private cobbled courtyard with a hand pump . Inside the residence was the uncomfortable elegance of the ancien regime . The future novelist was thirteen years old . Almost sixty years later he would recall the mirrorlike floors , the white and gold paneling , the " tense red damask " of the upholstery , the " perilous staircase . " The pump he forgot . <p> It was in this elegant and alien setting that the bad news broke and Henry Sr. wrestled with his grief . How much of his brother 's story did he pass on to his children ? The basic facts of J.J. 's gambling , his indebtedness , his suicide ? Probably . Of these things , Henry Jr . was no doubt informed . But they could not possibly have stilled this particular thirteen year-old boy 's disturbed imagination . The father may have ceased to complain , but it would be almost sixty years before the son wrote finis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved , most beautiful , most sacrificed of the Albany uncles . " <p> Dupine stared through the Houghton reading room 's book-lined walls . He saw J.J. , caressed by his family , wealthy through no fault of his own , and tragically dependent , undisciplined , evasive ; saw how his self-loathing , his dread of exposure , and his vulnerability before New York 's flintiest buccaneers sent him into a state of panic , so that he undertook the ultimate evasion , leaving his trustee to pay his notes , his triumphant enemies to collect on them , and his mother and brothers to deal with their own shock and guilt ( for their fortunes were still intact ) . <p> There was no way this waste of life could be clearly and rightly explained to the thirteen-year-old writer-in-training . Nobody had any idea what the handsome , rakish uncle had meant to the boy , and the boy himself only half understood how a poorly buried body continued to press a painful question on him . Was J.J. the handsome charmer young Henry had found him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everyone 's evasive headshakes seemed to imply ? Years passed , and the terrible question refused to go away . James 's first novel , Watch and Ward , pictures J.J. as a scoundrel on the run . In The Portrait of a Lady J.J. is ambiguous , defended by his fine daughter but reviled by everyone else . Only in " A Round of Visits " does J.J. finally reveal himself as the one fine sympathetic listener in New York 's frenzied crowd . <p> Seeing J.J. , Dupine saw Henry James as well , saw that the momentous question about the dead uncle was really a question the sharp-eyed boy had to resolve concerning his own path in life . For if J.J. was a true gentleman after all and not meretricious ( as all the silent headshakes implied ) , then did n't the fault lie with the brutally unformed society that " sacrificed " him ? The lesson of his suicide was that America undid its gentlemen , and that it was better , safer , to keep one 's distance , to build oneself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Houghton Library 's carefully ranked books about books , Dupine saw the whole dark process : how an obscure suicide shaped a life , how thirteen-year-old Henry Jr . became James the novelist , how a life and an art were founded on a dreadful event it had n't been possible to understand . <p> Something made Dupine come to . It was after five o'clock , and the reading room was empty except for two librarians staring at him and then at each other . Something had been said . There was an echo . Dupine stood up , trembling . His winning streak was over . He had solved his case . <p> Or at least he had come to the end of it . Outside he held on to the baluster and watched a group of Harvard students frolicking in the deep snow . They seemed so energetic and whole and free of unreal things ! The fact that people go to so much trouble for the dead suddenly made no sense at all . <p> Maybe another case would come along , and maybe it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest , except how fabulously his own time had passed as he meddled with the dead , and how far he was from his locked office and his thermos . <p> 1 Houghton Library , bMS AM 1092.9 ( 4600 ) folder 14 ; materials here and below quoted by permission of the Houghton Library . <p> 2 Quoted by permission of Schaffer Library , Union College . <p> 3 John Barber James to Isaac M.
