<p> After years of refusal , Syria finally agreed last year that Israel could continue to operate an early-warning station in the Golan Heights after returning the heights to Syria , an Israeli who was a senior government official at the time said Sunday . <p> Syria 's President Hafez Assad finally agreed in 1998 that the radar station Israel operates on the peak of Mount Hermon at the northern tip of the Golan would be manned by Israeli and American personnel after an Israeli withdrawal from the Heights , said Uzi Arad , who was a diplomatic adviser to Benjamin Netanyahu , Israel 's then-prime minister . <p> " An American umbrella was obtained under which Israel would have a presence and direct access to everything necessary , for a long time , " Arad told Israeli army radio . <p> The disclosure came four days after U.S. President Bill Clinton announced the resumption of Israeli-Syrian talks , which broke off 3 1/2 years ago .

Prior to that , the Syrians had used the strategic plateau to shell northern Israeli towns and villages . Israel maintains it will become more vulnerable if it gives back the heights , and must therefore retain the early-warning stations on the mountain as a precaution against surprise attacks from Syria . <p> Assad for years refused to consider the demand , saying the warning stations were a symbol of occupation and an affront to Syrian sovereignty . Israeli compromise proposals , such as leasing the warning stations from Syria while recognizing Syrian sovereignty over them , were rejected . <p> Assad also dismissed an Israeli offer to grant Syria an early-warning station in northern Israel in exchange for retaining the Mount Hermon facilities . <p> The change in Assad 's attitude began during in talks conducted on Israel 's behalf by the American Jewish millionaire and former diplomat Ron Lauder , Arad said . <p> " It was only when Netanyahu , through Lauder , made it clear that the early-warning station is in the nature of a deal-breaker , meaning that without it there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assad begin to show flexibility , " Arad said . <p> The possibility that Israel may give back the Golan has aroused apprehension among the 17,000 Jewish settlers living there , who face the prospect of having to give up their homes . <p> Barak has promised to hold a nationwide referendum if a handover is negotiated with Syria . Settler leaders from the Golan have said they will campaign against it . On Sunday Jewish settlers in the West Bank joined forces with the Golan settlers and promised to support their campaign . <p> Already , the fight is shaping up as a bitter one . In Jerusalem , the outlawed right-wing Kach group plastered posters on walls saying " Barak has betrayed the Golan . " Jerusalem police chief Yair Yitzhaki said an investigation had been launched . <p> Barak 's Labor Party , meanwhile , is working to enlist public support for a peace agreement with Syria . On Monday , the Israeli parliament will hear a report from Barak on the Syria situation and will vote on a motion to endorse his decision to resume talks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may join with the right-wing opposition in voting against the negotiations . <p> In a defiant gesture , Golan residents inaugurated a new 390-home residential neighborhood Sunday in Katzrin , the biggest Golan settlement . <p> About 290 families have already moved into their houses , which they bought even though Barak promised early this year in his campaign for prime minister that a top priority would be negotiating peace with Syria . <p> ( jk-lk ) <p> Jewish settlers inaugurated a new neighborhood in the Golan Heights Sunday , vowing to block efforts by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to trade the strategic plateau for peace with Syria . <p> School children waved Israeli flags and sang patriotic Hebrew songs next to rows of gleaming white houses topped by red tile roofs the new 390-house development in Katzrin , the Golan 's largest settlement . <p> Golan settlers are digging in their heels against a possible withdrawal from the area the expected price for peace with Syria in wake of the renewal of peace talks after a nearly four-year hiatus . <p> Barak is to meet Syrian Foreign Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning the heights , captured by Israel in 1967 , in exchange for peace , diplomatic relations and Syrian guarantees of quiet along Israel 's northern border . <p> A former senior official said Sunday that a key Israeli demand an early warning station on the Golan Heights had already been agreed to by Syria . Former adviser to then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Uzi Arad , said that during backchannel contacts in 1998 , Syria agreed to allow Israel to continue operating the station after a withdrawal . <p> With a peace agreement possible in the next few months , leaders of the 17,000 Israeli settlers on the plateau hope to sway public opinion in advance of a national referendum on returning the heights . They will remind Israelis that when the Golan was in Syrian hands , Syrian troops used it to shell the northern Israeli towns and villages below . <p> " Hopefully , with God 's will , we will continue to live here , to make a living , to make wine ... to build houses and raise children , " Golan resident David Meitav said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About 290 people have already moved into the neighborhood . <p> But the Golan settlers themselves appear divided the majority of them voted for Barak in May elections , even though he campaigned on a promise to resume negotiations with Syria . Unlike many of their more ideological counterparts in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip , many settlers in the Golan Heights were drawn to the area for quality of life reasons , not for political ones . <p> " There will be painful compromises for peace , including settlements , " pro-peace Golan resident Zeev Shor told Israel TV . <p> Returning the heights would be expensive the Israeli daily Yediot put the cost at dlrs 18 billion to compensate settlers and dismantle military bases . Finance Minister Avraham Shohat conducted a survey under previous governments to determine the price tag , but refuses to say how much the area is actually worth . <p> Shohat said Israel would need international assistance , and many Israelis are looking to the United States and Europe to foot the bill . <p> Meanwhile Sunday , the Israeli branch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find and bring to justice Nazi war criminals , asked Barak to demand the extradition of a Nazi war criminal it believes lives in Syria . <p> Alois Brunner allegedly helped organize the deportation and murder of 130,000 European Jews while serving as a top aide to Adolf Eichmann , the overseer of the Nazi death machine . <p> dk/sb <p> Jewish settlers inaugurated a new neighborhood in the Golan Heights Sunday , vowing to block efforts by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to trade the strategic plateau for peace with Syria . <p> School children waved Israeli flags and sang patriotic Hebrew songs next to rows of gleaming white houses topped by red tile roofs the new 390-house development in Katzrin , the Golan 's largest settlement . <p> Golan settlers are digging in their heels against a possible withdrawal from the area the expected price for peace with Syria in wake of the renewal of peace talks after a nearly four-year hiatus . <p> Barak is to meet Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa in Washington on Wednesday and Thursday to discuss returning the heights , captured by Israel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syrian guarantees of quiet along Israel 's northern border . <p> A former senior official said Sunday that a key Israeli demand an early warning station on the Golan Heights had already been agreed to by Syria .
