<p> HERE at the southern tip of the Appalachians , the colonial craft of hand-tufted bedspreads and rugs has evolved into the computerized manufacturing process of giant carpet mills that roll out 65 percent of the nation 's floor covering . <p> But when the workers - those hourly wage factory employees , more than half of whom never finished high school and 20 percent of whom are functionally illiterate - did n't keep pace with that change , Dalton industry leaders decided to make education of the work force a permanent part of their business . This community 's business stake in adult education resembles what education reformers are prescribing for United States industry on a national level . <p> " There 's a greatly increasing interest in training front-line workers because it 's not enough to just train supervisors and managers , " says Brenda Bell , director of business services for the National Alliance of Business in Washington . <p> The increasing interest in front-line workers looks like this in Dalton : <p> When a **30;304;TOOLONG course was offered at H &; S Whiting Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small limestone-grinding mill , including the owner 's 26-year-old son , enrolled . <p> Three hundred and nine companies in this rural industrial area have signed a Chamber of Commerce pact bucking the long tradition of hiring high school dropouts in factory jobs . <p> By 9 a.m. on any weekday , the parking lot at the Dalton Adult Learning Center is jammed , and there 's a waiting line for the basic reading and math courses offered on computers donated by the business community . <p> The increasingly sophisticated equipment that requires factory workers to use as much brain as brawn , combined with alarms sounded by the education studies of the 1980s , spurred the Dalton Whitfield Chamber of Commerce to create its Education is Essential Foundation . For a decade , the foundation has become increasingly involved in organizational as well as heavy financial commitments to the basic education of Dalton-area adults . <p> A landmark study released last June , " America 's Choice : High Skills or Low Wages , " surveyed more than 2,000 workers and managers in the US and six other industrial nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decade : Business must pick up where schools fail . <p> The study was done by the Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce , an ad-hoc group of corporate , government , union , and education leaders from all over the country . <p> Put together by the National Center on Education and the Economy , a public-policy think tank in Rochester , N.Y. , the report concluded that American industry will need a more highly skilled non-college-educated " front-line " work force in order to compete internationally . <p> In 1982 , Dalton-area business leaders began a campaign to convince factory owners as well as factory workers that front-line work requires more education than ever before . The commitment has grown from a promotional campaign to a major business-community investment aimed at ensuring that every adult in the Dalton area has a high school degree by the year 2000 . <p> In 1983 , the Education is Essential Foundation spearheaded recruitment of companies to sign a pledge not to hire teenagers before they graduate from high school . <p> But the majority of adult workers did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop job-site General Educational Development ( GED ) programs . Of the 700 students who completed high school last year in the Dalton area , nearly a third were adults receiving high school equivalency certificates . Many of the certificates were received through job-site classes . <p> The factory-site classes are popular because the setting is familiar and the worker is not asked to return to a formal school structure , which was the setting for earlier failures , says Terry Cullifer , superintendent of the Whitfield County School District . <p> Indeed , Stacy Henderson , who works at H &; S Whiting , where he mills limestone used in carpet backing , says he left high school because he had n't learned to read or do math and could n't do the work . <p> He enrolled in the factory GED program because he wanted to help his children in school , and because he realized not being able to divide numbers " stopped me from doing everything . " In four months , he has moved from a third-grade reading level to a ninth-grade level . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't read , write , or calculate math well enough to even qualify for these GED courses . So last summer , the costlier commitment of basic education was undertaken through a $500,000 business-sponsored program to offer one-on-one tutoring as well as computer tutoring in basic reading and math . <p> THE new emphasis on basic skills has caused a tripling of adult-education participation in just this school year , says Nolan Nix , director of adult literacy at Dalton College . <p> " This is not a one-time thing , " Mr. Cullifer says , adding that it has become clear that a permanent commitment from the business community is necessary . <p> " We reduced from 50 percent to 30 percent one high school 's dropout rate ( in the early 1980s ) , but with the economic expansion of the mid-1980s we watched it creep back up to the 40s , " he says of the need for continued diligence . He explains that the local rite of passage here through the generations has been to leave school for a factory job as soon as possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was with employers , says John Campbell , vice president of AA Food Services and a founder of the Education is Essential program . Especially in economic good times , when factories need employees , it is difficult to persuade a manager trying to meet immediate productivity goals that hiring a teen away from the classroom will ultimately cost the company money , he says . <p> Remembering the early difficulties of recruiting factory owners to sign the pledge not to hire dropouts , Mr. Campbell says , " One plant owner said that the only thing a kid does when he waits two years to finish school is lose two years on the seniority list . " <p> " It has taken a long time for business and industry to realize education does have an impact on production , " says Barbara Van Horn , assistant director of the Institute for the Study of Adult Literacy at Pennsylvania State University . <p> Most money spent on employee training , she says , is spent on management employees and not entry-level or line workers . But she notes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiries from businesses wanting to develop work-site basic training for line workers .
