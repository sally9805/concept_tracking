The outrageously fruitful ministry of my father <p> It is unnerving to say that the most godly person I have ever known is my father , James " Buck " Hatch , who turns 80 this year  --  unnerving because he has never been a tower of strength . Those of us who have known him best saw his weaknesses as dearly as his strengths . Grace amid weakness is , I suppose , the theme of this birthday tribute , for it was through his brokenness , not his strength , that he brought healing attention to the shadowed interior rooms of people 's lives . His life has much to say about the nature of Christian ministry . <p> A painfully shy person , always near the brink of depression , Buck has experienced life more . as a vale of tears than as a vista of opportunities . I often remember Dad coming to dinner  --  a boisterous affair with four sons  --  and just sit-ring at the table , not uttering a word . <p> His life can not be canonized as an all-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Horatio Alger type , rising from poverty on a hard-scrabble North Carolina farm to ownership of a prosperous hosiery mill in Charlotte . My father had little use for the respectability my grandfather sought . Driving a Pierce Arrow , owning a fashionable home , joining the country dub  --  these did nothing to fill the void of a soul not at home with itself . <p> Why his eldest son consistently forfeited opportunities for success was an enormous puzzle to my grandfather . An honors ; student at Duke University , Buck abandoned his pursuit of a career in medicine , much to his father 's dismay , after a powerful conversion experience drew him toward the ministry . He served for a time as a Presbyterian minister in Mississippi and then did graduate work in psychology at the University of Chicago under the renowned Carl Rogers . Once again he refused to use his degree as a professional springboard . He went to work for what his father feared was an upstart , fundamentalist institution , Columbia Bible College . To my grandfather , a dyed-in-the-wool member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense . <p> Without fanfare , for over 40 years , my father has poured himself into people at Columbia Bible College and the surrounding community . Year after year he taught classes in Scripture , biblical hermeneutics , psychology , and family life . His office was open ten hours a week for counseling , a pattern he continues today without charging a fee . <p> My parents ' relationship has been a model of gentleness and mutual respect . Dad was the most untypical Southern gentlemen I have known . He did n't wait around to be waited upon . From bathing the children to washing the dishes , he did whatever would be of most help to my mother . Mother , in turn , used our home and her warm hospitality to enhance Bucks calling . Their commitment to a common ministry cemented their beautiful relationship . Toward this end , they gladly submitted themselves to each other . <p> Dad has been no respecter of persons . He has naturally gravitated to " little " people , the ungifted , the unattractive , those often regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply wounded person whom he counseled for years wrote , " You have been Jesus in flesh and bone to me . " <p> As an adolescent , I could never understand how the ministry of my shy and private father reverberated with such power in people 's lives . When he taught , people listened , riveted . When he preached , people 's views of God and themselves changed , often in dramatic ways . And when he counseled , broken people tasted healing . <p> No amount of analysis can explain the contagious quality of love he radiates : he is a vessel simply brimming with the powerful love of Christ . But it is instructive to think about the central characteristics of his life and ministry . <p> OUTRAGEOUS AFFIRMATION <p> Describing my father 's character requires a word that is the antithesis of judgmental . Robertson McQuilkin , Dad 's longtime friend and colleague , coined it on my parents ' fiftieth anniversary when he wrote , " Your affirmation was constant and outrageous . " <p> That 's the word  --  outrageous . Buck showers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A family friend recently told me he regularly visits my parents ' home feeling that his life is a failure , and he always comes away buoyed with hope . " I could walk into Mr. Hatch 's house un-shaven , dirty , and completely disheveled , " he noted . " If I had only one strand of hair in place , Buck would stop me to note how great I looked . " <p> What a refreshing gift  --  to release others from judging themselves severely . In the exercise of this gift , Buck 's life and beliefs converge . The depths of his own experience awakened him to the heights of divine grace and care . His bedrock conviction : God is far more reliable , faithful , and forgiving than his people imagine . <p> Dad has known that inner yearnings for the embrace of God are rarely fulfilled , that people hear the message of grace but seldom believe it intended for them . Whatever people profess about God 's love and care , Buck knows the default mode of the human heart : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him by our repeated failures and lack of faith . <p> Dad 's single-minded goal throughout his preaching , teaching , and counseling has been this  --  to remove the veils that keep people from seeing God 's loving kindness . As Philip Yancey once noted in a letter , Dad 's influence was key in " unpolluting " his faulty concepts of God . Dad 's purpose , as Augustine put it , was to " restore to health the eye of the heart whereby God might be seen . " He did not chide people for their lack of spiritual vitality . Instead , deftly as a surgeon , he lifted away layer upon opaque layer of guilt and shame . In Buck Hatch 's presence , people experienced love and acceptance . <p> Buck lived what he taught  --  unconditional love . He knew nothing of stem fundamentalist moralism , despite living in an environment steeped in it . Instead , he gravitated to those who were out of step : the lonely , the rebellious , the angry , the confused  --  and particularly anyone whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my parents attest to his rare ability to pour himself into hurting people . One student wrote : " You have been a father to the hundreds of people who needed a father like you . " <p> OWNING BROKENNESS <p> The sterling quality of my dad 's ministry was not forged without great cost . Through the goodness of God over fourscore years , my father has come to radiate a deep and abiding joy . But you could not call him a happy person . He has always wrestled with thorns in the flesh that drove him not to rely on himself . <p> Buck Hatch bore the scars of a terribly dysfunctional family , whatever its outward success may have been . He remembers sitting at the top of the stairs , night after night , straining to hear a single kind word between his parents . He always climbed into bed disappointed . <p> The second of five children , Buck seemed most buffeted by his shattered home life . Although bright , he was insecure , melancholy , and introverted . His older sister and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , outgoing , and successful . One brother became student body president at Wheaton College where a friend described him as the most natural leader he knew . Similarly , his sister was a professional woman in the 1950s , rising to be director of personnel at the Carson , Pirie , Scott department store in Chicago . <p> Their success was short-lived . My aunt became a chronic alcoholic and lost her job , her apartment on the Magnificent Mile , and her exquisite furniture . My uncle 's story was yet more tragic . After serving as a chaplain in World War II , he openly renounced the ministry and his faith , cut off ties with the family , and lived a meager existence , bouncing from odd job to odd job , until his death . <p> Another brother , whose life as a young man seemed stable and prosperous , witnessed the collapse of his personal and family life . He died prematurely , his health also compromised by alcoholism . <p> This story of a shattered family is a parable of grace . Buck Hatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found strength in his infirmity and became a stronghold for his troubled siblings . My aunt , beaten and fatigued , moved in with my parents , who worked patiently to get her back on her feet . <p> Dad 's sister-in-law , rudely divorced by his brother , also moved to Columbia and found loving support in our home . Years later she wrote my parents : " I am not writing this letter just for myself . This comes from all the Hatches alive and dead whom you two have loved , helped in so many ways , and prayed for through the years . . . . You have helped a very unhappy and sorrow-filled woman get her life back together  --  again so gently , so lovingly and unfailingly there when needed . " <p> Dad never fled from his own brokenness or tried to paper it over . It is this lack of pretense that people found so winsome . My dad 's brokenness , not his strength , gives him ready access into the interior room of people 's lives . He typically listens more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , it springs from deep wells of experience . And when people confess to him their dark nights of the soul , they do not get pat solutions but an embrace from one who has also traversed the darkness . <p> AFFIRMING THE NATURAL AND THE SPIRITUAL <p> My father always laughs at any suggestion of his being an intellectual and points to my mother whose love for books outstrips his own . Yet from the time of his graduate training at the University of Chicago in the 1940s , my dad pursued a serious intellectual agenda : how to relate the natural " truths " of modem psychology to biblical revelation . In personal terms , he explored what it meant to have a relationship with God for those severely wounded by broken relationships . <p> This was Dad 's passion a generation before the church became awash in therapeutic forms of Christianity . Dad rejected any suggestion that he was an authority on the subject and refused to put his thoughts into writing , despite repeated suggestions from former students . Yet his insights were profound . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of reality , a careful blend and balance of the natural and the spiritual . He did not , for example , expect quick and easy spiritual solutions to problems faced by Christians who had been denied healthy intimate relationships . If Christianity is a relationship , my father reasoned , how can someone who has grown up in a web of poisoned relationships learn to identify with a nurturing and covenant-keeping God ? Like the Swiss physician Paul Tournier , Dad emphasized that new life in Christ does not free us from obedience to the natural order . In other words , no progress in faith erases a person 's past . Everything that has been lived and gathered by experience still exists and must be reckoned with . <p> At the same time , Dad insisted that helping people to cope psychologically was only the beginning of the pilgrimage to know God and his ways . Effective counseling , as he saw it , allowed people to get beyond themselves and prepared them to encounter the matchless grace of God , the only enduring reason for living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theological , and pastoral  --  gave my father acute insight into how broken people easily miss the essence of the gospel . How do hurting people negotiate the lofty expectations of the Christian life ? The Bible speaks of a life characterized by love , joy , and peace , yet people often look within and find pain , frustration , and bitterness . Buck Hatch understood that the logical reaction for many was to despair of living a fruitful Christian life . Similarly , he understood the tendency of persons who had not known much affirmation to try to win God 's acceptance through a flurry of good works . <p> With words gentle but firm , Dad called a halt to the cycle of guilt that plagued these Christians . He insisted that the gospel offered no quick fixes for deep-seated dispositions of the soul . Using Jeremiah , a man of tears , he was able to explain to some why life , given their backgrounds , would be a continuing struggle . At the same time , he pointed them to a faithful Savior whose mercy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just getting through each day could be a glorious victory of grace . <p> Try as they might , some people over the years were slow to believe that God loved and understood them . Yet they could count on the acceptance of at least one other person . Bitter travail and gracious healing allowed this friend to stand in the stead of his Savior . <p> My father 's ministry became widespread despite his best efforts to keep it small and local . He resisted lecturing at other institutions , putting his thoughts into print , or  --  perish the thought  --  creating a clinic or a parachurch organization to continue his work . <p> We live in a day when Christians strive to emulate the latest successful ministry , unaware that as a goal that is a contradiction in terms . The life of Buck Hatch is a vivid reminder that the divine economy inverts natural priorities . In Christ 's kingdom , the last shall be first , life is saved by losing it , and weakness confounds strength . In the greatest paradox of all , bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . This is the best training I could have received in a religion that worships a crucified Savior . <p> PHOTO : Drawing of James Hatch reaching up to hands that are reaching down toward him . <p> By NATHAN HATCH <p> <p> Nathan Hatch is vice president for graduate studies and research at the University of Notre Dame . <p>
