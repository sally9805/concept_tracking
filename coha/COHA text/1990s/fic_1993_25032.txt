 | down to care for her . The two women approached Clara . If she would take over the daughter 's identity , papers , and job up in Denver , Lena Sanchez would come on the line at the paint shop under her name . job boards were rigid but informal changes were made often , even though the charge for getting caught was treason . The war had turned , and no one thought that swapping jobs would menace the national security . Andy was delighted and Clara could give no reason why she should n't proceed with the change . The two women looked alike ; both were tall and dark haired . The workers close to them in both places would accept the change . With their heads and faces covered , and the bulky protective clothing , it was n't difficult to masquerade successfully , and , soon , to feel natural in the deception . Arlo Percival did n't learn of the move until mid-December . " Living in some barrio rooming house  --  why did n't you come to me instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rent-free . " " Fix her up with nothing . Do n't help us , " Andy growled . After they left the hospital , they headed for the heart of town and the big stores , now with their Christmas displays . " We do n't want anything from Arlo , " Andy said , still irritated . " No favors , no help . He 's up and walking and that 's okay . I visit him because he 's still sick and because  --  until now  --  there was no one else . When he leaves the hospital he 'll get a room somewhere and we 'll go hack to the way it was . I do n't want to owe him anything . " The streets were full of people . They came in sight of the Denver Dry at the center of a Christmas crowd . The stores were showing wartime creativity , tinsel made of shiny paper instead of metal , mirrors instead of lights , displays from delicately carved wood and paper . They had planned to stop and study the windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the  | street , talking as they walked . " We know him and he 's not a danger to us , " Clara said . Andy tossed hair out of his face in his familiar gesture of denial . " We say we wo n't let him get to us , but believe me , unless we keep our guard up , he 'll find a way , a way you 'd never have thought of , a way that would ruin any favor he could do . That favor will give him power over us and leave us ashamed , apologizing , hiding , or paying . " Clara had begun to draw into her coat . His anger reminded her of her father 's rages . She slowed , then stopped , stymied , remembering her father 's voice , his words , seeing his face , not wanting to be with this man , with any man so angry , so blind in his own anguish . " You 've been poor , and you think poverty is the only shame there is , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped beside her , taking her misery for embarrassment . " There 's worse shame . There are the looks people give you when they come to get the money that was promised them , or the deed they thought was theirs . I told you I 'd seen him in shackles and handcuffs . " " Where was that ? " " Here , " he said , and pointed to where they had been . " Sixteenth Street , a block down from where we were . " She began to listen to him again , to the anguish in his voice , and she wondered if she could ever confide in him any of her own , more subtle story . With his father 's criminal past , would Andy be able to understand the denigration of a sneer , the hateful lingering c c a word , or the poison of delicate sarcasm ? Helen of Troy ? " I was nine then , " he said . " We were walking up from Arapahoe . Someone called his name and all of a sudden there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground , and they used the handcuffs . Everyone was staring . They put us in the wagon . "  | " What happened to you then ? " " He went to jail ; I went to an orphanage . " They walked on in silence . She felt sympathy for Andy , but at the same time she was weighing living a life with him , trying to reconcile the reality of herself as a trained , certified teacher , a woman who could work in a factory , too , if need be , or tutor as she had done , with the woman Mama had been , in a poor cabin halfway up Placer Gulch . After the war they would need teachers again . Andy was n't a violent man and she was n't dependent as Mama had been , staying out of need , in even greater need . " How long were you in the orphanage ? " she asked . " Two years . " His answer was almost too soft to hear . " When Arlo got out , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gold camps . He tried to train me as a helper , but I always botched things up . Bad timing , he said . He 'd leave me one place or another , depending on whoever would take care of me . He 'd be gone  --  weeks , months  --  and then he 'd blow back and we 'd take off . I 'd be so glad to see him I 'd forgive all the rest . " Andy stopped and stood as though trying to decide if this were the right place , the right way to tell her what he so needed to tell . " Then he got caught again on some stock thing . " They started walking again . " In court they say the People of Colorado versus Arlo Per-cival . ' I was set to be a character witness at his trial , but I froze up and could n't say anything . The People of Colorado ... " It occurred to Clara that Andy must be saying these things for the first time . The words had a rusty hesitance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too loud . Perhaps he had n't put some of those sights into words before , not even in his own mind . " So he was hack in jail ? " " Yes . I got placed with a farmer in Arvada , Higgins . One day Higgins took me to Denver in his wagon . We were outside Union Station , waiting for a loading , and it was a little after dawn . They had a bunch of prisoners for transfer down to  | Canyon City . People were watching them . The criminals were in canvas pants and those undyed muslin shirts jail clothes , and they were all chained to one another . I started to move away , but Higgins was standing there staring . Then he came , Arlo , near the end of the line . It was sudden , so sudden I thought I was seeing things . He had trained me not to make any show of recognition until he gave me the high sign . As he passed , he winked at me . Higgins thought I had made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't mock them in their misfortune . ' I did n't see Arlo for five more years . " They were almost at the capitol without knowing how they had gotten there . They turned around and started back . " No help from Arlo , " Andy said . " None . " Arlo Percival was released from the hospital and moved to a place near Union Station . He got a job in a war plant and began a series of gambling games that ran twenty-four hours a day . He was caught . He got thirty days in the city jail . He did the punchhoard : sixty days . He did the pyramid scheme : ninety days . Andy kept on with his visits to Denver , a nineteen-hour train ride clown and back on a freight car , passenger service having been curtailed by the war . At the time , he was moonlighting for a company that was buying up mine sites . The trip got him a six-hour visit with Clara , who was so frightened of being tied to anyone that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew t hat his traveling was a sign of love stronger than any declaration would have been . She wanted to yield to him but could n't . In June , the invasion of Europe began and the gear-up put everyone on longer hours . " We ship while the rivets are still hot at Id the paint 's still wet , " the poster said . Andy came down again and met Clara right off shift , in overalls and hairnet , sweating and exhausted . He had a ring . He had asked his miner friends to pound together two dozen tiny nuggets , and these he had had sOIdered into a backing . She turned it over in her hand . " I ca n't wear your ring . Here they think I 'm already married . "  | " Wear it on a chain around your neck . " " How did you know my size ? " " I guessed . It needs to be big and loose , right now . I know that , too . " She wanted to yield but could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his scorn , about the words and silences with which he made the women ugly to themselves . " Even now , when I see him in my mind , it 's looking down at us , at Mama and me , as we scrub . " Andy listened quietly , and whenever the words deserted her or she felt herself slipping into complaint and her face heated , he said , " Go on . " " It sounds so petty ... so small .... " " Go on . " She realized that had the man listening been Father , he would have made a contest of it , comparing his griefs with hers , as though there were some advantage in the suffering , a conferring of rank , a tribute to be wrung from her . Andy had none of this . He said , " Now I understand why it scares you to be married . But listen to me , Clara . Not every man treats people that way . " Father , having won the contest , would have used it to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt vindicated by whatever tale of suffering he had heard . So Clara judged Andy as he listened , weighed his listening , sifted and measured it , and slowly , like a nervous invalid in a summer river , let herself slip , inch by inch , with caught breath and trepidation , into water . In July , she got another long weekend and hitchhiked to Aureole . The driver of the beer truck expressed amusement . " What are you doing , lady , moving ? "  | Clara had a suitcase and two long , muslin-covered sacks , which she laid carefully over the space between the seat and the hack of the cab . " I 'm getting married , " she said . " These are my dress and veil . " The veil was white , the dress a soft lemon color with a small , gray figure and a light gray sash . She had made the dress herself and it looked homemade to her when she tried it on . Andy had written to her to make the trip up instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katy wanted to have the party . Tessie Rubano was coming from Placer Gulch and the girls from Granite and Gold Flume , where they were now living . " We can get married at the courthouse , " he wrote . " Luckily , Arlo is doing six months in Colorado Springs or we would have to invite him , too . When he sees a courthouse , he crosses his wrists from habit . " She knew his joke was an attempt to get past the pain that none of the wedding party would be his people . But Andy 's boss stood up with him and Katy with Clara . As they faced the judge , Mary Louise Coleman , four years old , went up gravely and took Clara 's left hand . Oliver got the wedding picture on the courthouse steps . When the party was over , and the cake and punch served and eaten , Andy and Clara left to register at the only hotel in Aureole still open . Andy felt Clara 's fear , so instead of going up to their room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went up Pickaxe Hill , which overlooked the town . As the day passed , what should have been the long , contented , leisurely day , Clara laced the evening with growing anxiety . She went into longer mid longer silences . Andy said , " You do n't want a wedding night , do you ? " She shook her head and began to cry . At first he nodded and let her sit herself on a rock , but when the sobs grew instead of quieting , and lengthened into the long weeping that sounded like inconsolable grief , he began to be  | frightened . Should he touch her ? Tentatively , he patted her shoulder , but the touch only made her shrink from him . He tried talking but she seemed not to hear . There seemed no way to reach her . She had been leaning on the rock , but her sobbing had so weakened her that now she lay down on the ground on her side , legs drawn up , arms protecting her breasts . When she could weep no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way carefully down the hill . " Are you going back to Oliver and Katy 's ? " She shook her head . " You do want to stay married , then ? " She nodded yes , keeping her head averted . Then she followed him dumbly into the hotel and up to the misnamed honeymoon suite . Clara was married  --  as Mama had been and Tessie Rubano and other women she knew . She was now chained by law , and chained by love , because she did n't doubt her love for Andy Percival or her desire for him . Sensing it , knowing it , she knew that its depth would also be the depth of her self-abasement . Would he use Father 's ridicule or demands for instant attendance , or would he use the jealousy of some of the husbands of Spanish Town or the war plant ? Would he find drink , or some other cruelty , something worse ? She lay on the bed and wept again and thought that as ugly as weeping made her , he would n't want her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , " he said , " but I want you to see something . " " What ? " " Have you ever seen a naked man ? " She shook her head . He went away into the bathroom and came out again and said to her back , " Sit up . Sit up and look . " Had the tone been bullying or hostile , she would have run away , left him . Instead , the voice was tender and even humorous . He did n't touch her . " Look at us , " he said . " Look at how vulnerable we men are . " As she looked , he became erect , and he said , " I ca n't appear dignified , not even when I want to . "  | She understood how he was standing before her , ridiculous to himself in his obvious need , a man willing to undergo the cold scrutiny of a sex-terrified virgin for as long as she would subject him to it . He turned around . " Here 's the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say now . I do n't steal . I do n't steal money or love or bodies . I do n't steal people 's possessions or their souls . " They did n't make love that night . The night after , when she said it would be all right , he shook his head and said , " I 've been alone a long time . I expect to be married an even longer time . I want it to be right . You 're not ready , but you will be someday . " They kissed and embraced , and the next day she went back to Denver and the paint shop . A week later Andy came down , and the week after again . They had begun to embrace each other lying down , slowly learning the way their bodies looked and felt . " What 's this ? " His hand had found and was tracing the ragged scar on her thigh . She told him about the day they all cut broom , about the hailstorm and the attack by the unknown man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her proud self-defense now sounded excessive and hysterical , not courageous , and she ended feeling ashamed in spite of Andy 's awe . Later , he said , " I know you got married against your wanting to be free . I know you did it out of love for tie , because I needed that promise from you . I do n't want you to feel enslaved . If you should ever want to stop being married , I wo n't keep you . " " It 's not about being with any other man , " she said . " I know , and we are little by little making love . " A friend at the factory had a cabin near Morrison , and on another weekend , Clara and Andy hiked there and made love one rainy Saturday . The first time she was only glad to be able to do it , feeling little pleasure , but the second was less guarded and she began , hesitantly , to respond to him . It occurred to her that her pleasure in him was pleasure enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was going to be all right . She cried with relief .  | Andy was relieved as well . " I 'd be lying to say I was n't happy for that . Your body trusts me now , even if you are n't ready , and that 's enough for now . " Late in September , in Denver , Clara got a letter from Aureole . It was typed , an invitation : Andrew Percival Invites Clara Coleman Percival To an Occasion Thursday , September 29 , at 7:00 pm . In Front of the Methodist Church in Golden Dress Is Formal Was it a wedding ? Was it his idea to give her a church wedding ? Golden was at the end of the trolley line , and she could make it if she left work early . She would wear the dress she had been married in , and the shoes . She would need to buy a hat . As she rode to Golden on the trolley she thought about the complexity of her present life . The lie about being married to a soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a man obviously not in the service . She would have to move and become Clara Percival at an Anglo rooming house while she stayed Lena Sanchez at work . The church in Golden was on a side street shaded by big , old maples . It was locked . On the next block was a gas station and she changed out of her work clothes in the ladies ' room . Andy was in front of the church when she got hack . He was dressed as he had been for their wedding . He grinned at her and said , " Come on . " Then he led her away from the church , east and then north , past the Coors brewery and the junkyard ; there was no more town . East of where they walked were the railroad yards with two or three cars sleeping in the weeds of the siding . " Where are we going ? "  | " Keep walking . " They turned at a field littered with what the wind had blown there . " Keep walking , " Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant . They began to climb a little hill . There was a footpath , but Clara was afraid for her stockings so she stopped and took them off . What was this to be , a wedding party in a hobo jungle ? Then , just as the sun went behind one of the mountains , they broke the crest of the hill to come into a protected glade . There were wild maple shrubs and aspen screening the glade from the view of the railroad and the back of the town . Above them the hill rose sharply like a wall covered with vines . With the quieting of late afternoon all the sounds hushed except the comments of birds on last errands . The low sun dappled the glade with broken light . In the middle of the glade someone had carefully arranged a low table . There were cushions at the two set places . Silver threw blades of fire , crystal rang with light . A white cloth lay gleaming under the settings . For an instant , mountains , table , silver , and crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped behind the other mountain and left them in afterglow . Clara stared . Andy was watching her , his eyes studying this scene that could have been part of The Golden Bird or Beauty and the Beast . He walked to the table , bent , and lit the candles , then went to a large basket standing to the'side . He began taking things from the basket . Soon there was champagne bubbling in the glasses . Much of the meal had been wild-gathered . There was a mushroom soup made of boletes , spring-beauty tubers and pigeons with pine nuts , cattail roots with wild garlic . For dessert they had sand plums stewed with honey . Then they lay back and the moon rose . Once again , Clara thought , Andy had stripped before her ; this time his tenderness was the use of his father 's genius for  | magic moments and prestidigitation , but in her service , surmounting his own fear and dread . He had always spoken with scorn of how his father traded on people 's dream hungers and mythic wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the part of himself he hated , to give her this gift . They were in the spell of the evening , but when they undressed under the moon , they folded their clothes carefully , like the careful , prudent people they were .  | tiara went back to Denver to continue as Lena Sanchez . Andy came as often as he could and by November her story of a Tewa husband in the Pacific had collapsed . To her surprise , instead of condemning her dishonesty , the people at work and the rooming house praised her cleverness and spunk . Her astonishment made Andy laugh . " The world forgives nerve when it wo n't forgive funny looks or clumsiness . For once , my father 's game works to our benefit . " Clara had a free afternoon one weekday , and in a surge of good feeling she went to the address Arlo had given them after  | his last incarceration . A bitter landlady informed her that Arlo had n't been seen for two months , and the suitcase full of valuable family heirlooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper , a dented saucepan , and three or four jars without lids . He owed her money and he had cheated most of the other boarders out of larger or smaller sums in greater or smaller ways . Clara had begun to overcome her fear , and her body had begun yearning . She wanted Andy . She wanted Andy in a home she made for him . They had walked a hundred miles , sat in the rooms of strangers , borrowed beds , sat up late in bus stations and train stations as surrogate homes . From Denver Clara could look westward to the rising swell on swell of hill to mountain , green to blue-gray , blue-gray to the white of the high peaks in a vast order like the rise and fall of fugal music , sound on sound , theme on theme . The theme was " Come home , get up and come home . " The war ended in Europe , and rumors went around that jobs would be unfrozen . Then the war ended in Japan and the rumors went again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plant and trade back Lena Sanchez 's identity for her own . Andy was rooming in Aureole . The landlady said she would consent to their double occupancy , and Clara moved , happy to be with him and back in the mountains . But she looked for work all over town and came back disappointed . What jobs there were had been posted for men . People said that February and March were the bottom of the year , and she soon wore out all the possibilities of the Ute River Voice 's classified page . " Wait till things pick up for the summer , " Andy said . " We 've got the money . " On a Sunday in March , the landlady came home from church and said to Clara , " I do n't know if this would interest you , but one of the ladies from Callan says that the one-room school in Gold Flume needs a teacher . " Clara stared at her . " Where ? "  | " Gold Flume . The job is n't posted yet , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested . " Gold Flume was a dying town at the other end of the Ute Valley . It was thirty-five miles from Aureole and past Granite and Bluebank , past Placer Gulch and Callan , farther even than the Callan School . Clara all but ran to the courthouse on Monday to apply . The clerk stared at her . " Lord may mark the sparrow 's fall , but the whole damn valley knows it before the thing lands . You would n't want a job like that , would you ? " The valley was between snows . There were winds from the south during that season , and the whiteness quilting the mountains was still deep , but in the valleys , old patches of decaying snow lay in pockets where the sun did n't reach . Mild days would entice the sap in trees to rise and sudden temperature changes , as much as fifty degrees in six hours , would freeze the sap and explode the tree from inside . There was a feeling of dry exhaustion in the ground from which no green yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns in their familiar slackness and ruin . Placer Gulch looked weed-grown and abandoned . Callan had smoke from only a few stove-stacks ; the Little Annie workings were the same , but Whiskey Gulch had a new working and some of the old mines had been repaired . " It was the war , " Andy murmured , " and the bomb . We started to get molybdenum , uranium , strontium  --  the ore was all in the tailings out on the hillsides , there for the taking . Now that the war 's over , who knows ? " Callan School was still standing , crippled and diminished , its windows gone , its students drained away to Denver and Pueblo and islands in the Pacific Ocean . The derelict made Clara sad and so did the starving valley , which they now saw with the practical eyes of potential inhabitants . The train would be late in win-ter  --  there would have to be a snow-family to stay with , although school would close on the days of deep snow as it had in her own  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , judging , weighing her wish against practical possibility . Gold Flume lay cupped at the end of the valley . Strands of the Ute River ran past it , through the fingers of the mountain basins . The town was compact , held in by the mountains , a mining town like all the Ute towns , living boom-bust and hand-tomouth , first and grandest on gold , then silver , then on a succession of lesser minerals , poorer and poorer , the shine fading , dimming , and now gone dark about the eyes . The town itself was a single paved street running east and west from the train station platform . A half-closed hotel with a faded sign stood east of the station . Andy and Clara got off the train and looked down the two-block main street to where it ended at the field the schoolchildren used at recess . Their glance took in the entire town . Directly to the east was the school , which stood on a rise that ended at the foot of the mountain behind it . They walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the businesses of Gold Flume : a bank ; a WPA post office , which was the newest of the buildings ; a small grocery ; a feed store ; a hardware and lumber yard , closed and abandoned ; a firehouse ; a drug and dry-goods store ; and five saloons , three of them closed . " A town that ca n't keep its saloons going is no town for me , " Andy murmured , but she saw he was joking , trying to keep her spirits up . They came to the school yard , stepping over the old snow patches up the path to the square , stolid one-story structure of local dolomite , like Callan School 's but grayer and much smaller . There were steps up to a porch . Although Clara wondered how Andy was seeing all this , everything she saw excited her . She would be teaching a regular class . There would be the possibility of continuity and watching students grow . The school was part of its mountain and part of its town , a solid building one  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on three sides . She did n't dare look at Andy 's face . They had gone up on the porch with the hesitancy of uninvited guests and they turned to the view of the town and the way they had come . A woman was walking up the worn path , also avoiding the bordering crusts of snow . Miss Willa Optegard , she would be , the teacher . It was easy to tell by her quick , purposeful movements . Although the day was n't cold , she was bundled in a man 's heavy mohair coat . She looked up at them from the bottom of the stairs , her glance going from one to the other . Clara spoke . " I 'm Clara Percival . This is my husband . " Miss Optegard looked perturbed for a moment , but Andy smiled his disarming smile and said , " You ladies get on with it . I 'll walk through town and see if there 's a checker game on at the firehouse . " They saw the teacher relax . Andy negotiated the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . He turned at the bottom . " I 'll be back in an hour or so . Take your time . " In silence the women watched him make his way down the worn path . Then Willa Optegard squared her shoulders and faced Clara . " I do n't know nothing special to tell you about the school . It 's the only place I been , so I do n't know no other thing . " Her voice was soft but slightly nasal , a countrywoman 's voice . " I heard you had the college and got you a certificate and that 's why I thought you was a man .... " Clara heard sorrow in her voice and saw it on her face . Willa went on , softly . " The children is mostly good , some is slow , and one or two 's bullies . You have them from the gulches , and some of them 's pretty strange till they get to be with folks a bit . " Clara felt a pang at the phrase " from the gulches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It dawned on her then that the words had a ring of finality in them . " You 're finishing the year out , are n't you ? "  | " No , ma'am , they ai n't letting me do that . " Then Willa Optegard looked down , and then her hand went to the buttons on her coat , one , two , three , and the coat came open and there was the little belly beginning . " I do n't have no gold band . It was n't no love , either . It was Kester French , drunk . 1Ie 's forced other girls , too , and the town knows what he does , but ... " She trailed off . " But you have to go . " " Yes 'm . " " Were you raised around here ? " " Chinaman 's Gulch . " " You went to this school , did n't you ? " " Yes 'm . Miz Eliot kept school in my time .

She got the roll book and began to go down the names , giving a short description of each of the twenty students presently in the school . Some of the names evoked affection , some regret . " You write a new page each year ? " " Yes 'm . " " How many of these pages are yours ? " " There 's six . Six years I been here . Do you want to look at last year 's ? " " No . This is the county book , so you ca n't take it , but why do n't you sign each page and then copy all the names ?

Seventyeight children . " This one here , he 's pure gold , " Willa said , " and this one here , he 's fool 's gold , " and they laughed together . Andy came back and they sent him out again . He came back again with sandwiches . " I was on my way to the grocery and as I passed a house a lady called to me , a Mrs. Bordereau . She said she was sorry you were leaving , Miss Optegard .

By the time they finished , Andy and Clara had missed the afternoon train . Miss Optegard left them at the school , thanking them and holding the composition book tight against her chest . She would be gone before classes began on Monday . " It means I 'll be wanted right away , " Clara said . Andy nodded . " I know . This town is one big recording studio . I 'll tell you this , though . This school has your name written all over it , and by now Town knows that , too , and is deciding on it . " " What do you think ? " " Why do n't you stay the week and decide whether you 'll help out till they find someone or take the job ? Come home Friday and tell me . " " How would you feel if the answer was yes ?

" This may be a beautiful place to live . It 's beautiful to look at , with the mountains all around , but the people ... " " You mean because of what they 're doing to that little woman ?

Clara could tell by the way the children came into the schoolroom . Their grasp of history was a bit shaky and they had little real feeling for poetry or literature , but their dates and facts were in place , and they had a respect for the importance of school and for its seriousness . When she saw the three textbooks available , Clara realized that her predecessor had done a good job with what she had had . But it would be almost impossible to correct the effects of Willa 's indifferent grammar . Her errors had been enshrined by the class in her honor . At last Clara said , " Miss Optegard spoke in her way and I speak in mine .

Clara learned she had to confine them to answering factual questions only , because their responses to the thinking questions she favored were so often wild or mystical . Had she been as strange as any of these , as filthy and odd-sounding ? She came home every day that first week spent , shocked at the difference between her dream , the long-cultivated , longheld dream of being a teacher , and the grinding realities of the profession 's daily pursuits . The work was exhausting , draining , full of pitfalls . With so many of the children related to one another , Clara knew she would have to learn all of those links , or their enmities and alliances would be unintelligible . The groupings  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the beginning . The town had its classes , too , small as they were . The men connected with the railroad had the only substantial houses in town and  | there were four or five prosperous ranchers who had flourished with the war 's demand for beef . Peter Tavistock 's father was town telegrapher , a fact Peter had made known to her on her first day . Jennie Bogard was a Ranch girl , Orval Bordereau a Town boy , son of the woman who had made sandwiches for Willa at her inauspicious good-bye . Clara had to learn who ate biscuits with ( leer fat for lunch the way she had , and who ate baked bread with slices of meat and slabs of pie . There were school-yard rivalries about things she could only guess at , and school itself fonned a kind of shadow world of numbers and letters pulled over the real world , an intrusion of one order on another , more real one . Was school to some of them what it had been to her , a refuge , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The years of reading to the laundry workers had convinced Clara of the value of reading aloud , and she gave them half an hour of history in the morning and three-quarters of an hour of literature every afternoon , encouraging the children to bring some handwork with them to do during the reading . To her surprise she had to teach them how to do that  --  sewing , carving , weaving , knitting . She did n't stop to explain the words in the stories but read for pleasure only , and her first moment of reward was to find a group in the play yard one afternoon in late April enacting " The Speckled Band , " with Orval Bordereau as the snake . She had n't imagined striking the children when they were i i iattentive , noisy , or bullying and was amazed to learn that they read her behavior as unconcern when she simply corrected them . The expectation was for the slap , the switch , the ruler , or the strap , depending on the seriousness of the offense . Miss Optegard was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow one . Where had they learned to equate concern with such punishment , she wondered , as though words had no real meaning ? Milvin French was a bully and a disruption to the class-  | room . Her criticism made him laugh and everyone kept pointing to the strap hanging in the corner , Milvin no less than they . " Ai n't you going to whip me ? " as though he had been done out of some reward . She told him to sit in the corner facing the wall . " I want to convince you that bullying and violence are wrong , " she said , " but how can I do that by bullying you ? " He stared at her with the absolute confidence of a person for whom there is no lower level to which he can fall . " And what if I wo n't do that ? " " Then we 'll all have to find a way of restraining or ignoring you , because you can not be allowed to disrupt the class . " Milvin 's bullying continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his or her feelings about Milvin 's behavior . The difference in how everyone saw him and how he had thought they saw him was so appalling to him that he consented to exile in the corner rather than their icy , honest appraisals . It did n't work well . In the end she whipped him and felt wretched , and he took the whipping with a smirk of vindication . " I do n't believe in the strap , " she said , " but my father was a violent man and I have some anger in me , too . Do n't test my justice . If I ever got started , I do n't know that I could stop . " Whether because of that speech or because he had broken her resolve , Milvin was less of a problem thereafter . Andy had found them a cabin on Third Street , behind the bank 's old stable . It had been a miner 's cabin and its two rooms reminded Clara so painfully of the Coleman place in Placer Gulch that she had to nerve herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in it . She also had to keep this from Andy because he had given up convenience and pleasant rooms in Aureole to make the move and thought the place being warm , dry , cheap , and in Gold Flume was all they needed . It was at the narrowest part of the town and dark after 2:00 P.M. with the mountains shutting off the light of the sun . He was a good husband , a generous , tender man , and his consideration as a lover was rewarded slowly but deeply by an  | increasing response from her . Her fear did n't leave suddenly , as she had hoped it would , but in shreds , thinning out and tearing like cobweb in rain , from its center outward . Yet when it snowed and the cabin smelled the dank smell , the mouse-grease smell of stale kerosene , Clara felt all her resolve weaken . In May , one of the Gulch boys came to school after a threeday absence , limping and yellow with suffering , both eyes discolored , his lip split . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inquiry he shrugged . " He was drunk is all . I can hide if I want , but this time there was Ma . " He got no sympathy from his schoolmates , who laughed at his raccoon eyes . She tried to speak to them about compassion without further humiliating the boy , only to meet their closed faces . At home in the fumy cabin she complained to Andy . " My school should have given me a framework for this , a means of understanding it , a kind of height over it ? " She was thinking of the cool view an eagle might have over its range , one that took in the scurry of a vole , the lift of a mountain . Andy sighed . " Which did you hate more , that man beating the boy or the other kids laughing at him ? " " Both . I tried , but I could n't get them to feel anything . What 's the good of the arithmetic , the literature , the science , if they stay savages ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , dishes in both hands . " A boy made me whip him the other day and everyone approved . They have a hunger for justice , or what they think it is , but they 're afraid of softness and change . Nothing I learned in school prepared me for innocent savagery . " " Does anybody know how to see this problem ? Would any of your professors be able to help ? " Clara sent out letters for advice and waited . Every day she taught the school subjects and also showed the children how to wash , using a tub she had bought and kept under the eaves of the privy , how to brush the teeth , to comb the hair , how to use  | kerosene for scurf and head lice , and oil for chilblains . She pulled ticks from them , explaining how they should inspect their bodies ( luring the season , March through June . In her letters she tried to make the words she used neutral , to shame no one : The father of this child does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior problem . I ca n't keep him after school because he 's needed at home and would be whipped . I had to whip this boy to get him to obey . I do not like to do this . Do you have some approach to this problem ? Another letter : I think the father has incest with these girls . I think their brothers know , or participate . How can I protect the girls ? What can I do when the other children laugh at their situation ? A boy was badly beaten by his father . The other children laughed at his bruises . How can I teach them compassion ? There was no answer to the first letter . The answer to the second was harsh : You are not a priest or a minister . Your job is to teach the school subjects . The incestuous family you describe is depraved and probably beyond salvage . The boy must learn obedience . Teach the children to mind their own business and not embarrass the girls and the boy by looking at them . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She read the letter and handed it to Andy . " Idiot , " he said . " What do you want to do now ? " " I 've been thinking . School will be out in another month . I want to make home visits . I could use the pretext that I 'm new and that the school meetings were snowed out . "  | " You would n't be going up there to tell some half loony prospector not to beat his kids , would you ? " " No , I 'd just see them and let them see me . Mama would have valued such a visit , I think . " " Well ... " He seemed dubious . Andy had news of his own . The old workings on Hungry Woman Mountain , the mountain that rose above Placer Gulch , were being revived . He had also begun doing private surveys after hours . " I 'll take you on those Gulch and Ranch visits , " he said . " It 'll get me familiar with the country . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the schoolhouse door was locked for summer vacation in June , she began the Town visits . Part of her reason for going , she realized , was that it gave her the impetus to leave her dank , dark house . The Frenches were the biggest family in Gold Flume , and the poorest . They , and those Matskes and Legrands into which the French women had married , lived all together in five wrecked buses out of town on the east side . A slow thread of the Ute , obstructed and stagnant , wandered through tailings and ash pits on that side , and there was a footbridge to get over the marshy bog to their island . The compound had no water , even by pump , and the buses were barricaded behind a half mountain of junk . The women of the families , mothers and mothers-to-be , aunts and grandmothers , sat on crates , chair frames , and overturned pails and watched Clara cross the stream . She came closer and was given no greeting and after a while took a crate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wanted to meet you , " she said . They made no response but stared at her , nine or ten unblinking , unwavering pairs of eyes . The words of introduction she had planned dried up in her mouth . She understood that they assumed her visit was for some official purpose and therefore meant trouble for them . Around  | them , unintroduced , people came and went , old men and children . The women silenced barking dogs and screaming youngsters with well-aimed stones . The school-age children had vanished , and only when Clara 's visit was over did they reappear , defiantly or cautiously , from one of the buses . She told the women some of what she had planned for the coming year . She asked their opinions . They had none . After a while she showed them the books she had brought . " They 're stories the children might like to read over the summer . " The books were the new pocket books developed out of the needs of the war . She had bought them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply one to every family in her school . The two she had brought were a Bret Harte for the boys and a Grimm 's fairy tales for the girls , and she held them out and looked into the cluster of defiant and disinterested faces . Before she could say anything , the oldest of the women rolled her tongue into her lip and spat through the quid . " Ai n't no use for none of that . " So Clara brought back the hand that held the books , got up , and said her good-byes , feeling their scorn behind her as she made her way toward the wobbling bridge . There was a space of about twenty yards before the bridge where the way was hidden by undergrowth and piled junk . She stopped there , overwhelmed by the atmosphere of the place , the careless , hopeless filth of everything , the smells , the vacant-eyed , slack women . There was a sound from the side  --  rats , maybe , but then there was a voice : " Teacher  --  Miz Percival ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Wait up a minute ? " Clara knew , by then , that Frances 's mother had been deserted by Bobby Legrand and had moved with Frances back to her people in the compound . Frances had the Frenches ' long , bony nose and fine , mouse-colored hair , but there was a grace in her , a quickness from some other source . She was twelve years old .  | " Them books ? " " Do you want them ? " " Yes 'm  --  I like reading . I could keep ' em clean and nice and bring ' em back in the fall ? " Clara realized that the girl wanted the discipline of borrowing and returning . " Do you want both of them ? " " Yes 'm , if I could . " " If you read these and want more , come to my house and I 'll give you others . " " That 's Town , your house . " " It 's not a quarter mile from here ? " " We do n't go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and disappeared into the tangle of underbrush and wreckage . " I thought being a Gulch child was all there was to poverty , " Clara commented to Andy that evening . She could still smell the rat-sweet , maggot-sweet odor of the Frenches ' compound clinging to her clothes and the memory of their stares at the edges of her eye . It came to her , before she turned from the thought in distaste , that there had been some merit in Father 's demands for graciousness and order , as cruel and absurd as he had made them . " The Frenches ' poverty was different from yours and from mine , " Andy said . Clara wanted to tell him all about the morning , but her feelings were too complex . She described the family and the area and something else she had noticed : " Body and head lice are gray down there , near the river . They are brown up in the gulches . " " Adaptation , " Andy said , and grinned playfully at her . " Darwin knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sally Bordereau 's small , fussy parlor in the wealthier , cleaner part of town . " You 'll stay to din-ner  --  Orval senior should be back soon . " " I need to be home soon to fix Andy 's dinner , " Clara said . There had already been cake and tea .  | They talked about Orval junior , a placid , peaceable boy . " He 's improved in his reading just since you 've been here , " Mrs. Bordereau said . " After dinner he reads to us , and he never did that before . Later we talk about what he 's read . He said you taught them all how to do that . " " I brought this book to help him keep up over the summer , " Clara said , " but if I 'd known that , I would have come with a different one . " She left the Bordereau house in a sweet glow . Some of the Matskes had married Frenches , but there was a spirit , an energy in the family that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick up town gossip and they were disappointed when she failed to pursue the line , but she did learn more about the relationships guiding the town , and the learning was provided in high merriment by the five or six women sitting around the kitchen table . " Visiting all the families ? " " Yes , it 's the quickest way to get to know the students and their parents . Next week I 'll be visiting Mrs. Tavistock . " There was a long silence  --  embarrassment , Clara thought ? and then one of the women said , " Our sister works over there , cleaning house . " There was silence again , and suddenly they all burst out in a wave of laughter . " The damn woman 's gone through our whole family and ca n't find one of us to satisfy her . "  | The Tavistocks were the only people in town rich enough to hire a servant . The house was three stories of ornate but weathered wood . It stood on the east side of town and had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in winter and needed a protracted stay , and it commanded the back of the station where the telegrapher 's office was located . The days of the railroad empire were over , and the house had been derelict before being taken over by the telegrapher and his family . A boggy area , a teuce , and thirty yards of vines and bushy growth separated it from the French compound .  | As Clara came up to the house , she noticed how much had been done to accentuate the house 's separation not only from the Frenches , but also from the town itself . The high wroughtiron fence surrounded the house on three sides , the fourth being the beginning of Prospector Hill . Vines had been trained up the fence and there was a heavy gate that cried on its hinges like a rack victim when Clara pulled at it . Everything inside the fence had been marked out , corseted . A walk laid with little stones at the sides led to the house and the square patches of lawn were all demarcated with stones as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railings ; the door was narrow also . Clara went up and knocked . She remembered the gossip over Daisy Matske 's table the week before . " She has family money , the missus , so they live in that big wreck like it was the family mansion back in Boston , Massachusetts , or someplace . They could n't keep the servants they sent for , so they 're stuck with us . " The woman who answered Clara 's knock was wiping her hands on a rough towel . " You must be the new schoolteacher . Come on in . Her Nibs is upstairs . I 'm Ella Matske , and Tod Matske 's my boy . My sister Daisy told me about your visit over there . I think it 's good , you doing that . It 's good for the kids . " The lively , chatty woman made Clara feel at home but as she laughed and answered one of Ella 's questions , Clara glanced up , and in the dimness of the hall staircase she made out a figure standing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked you , Ella " ? the voice was penetrating , used to command ? " to announce people , not to socialize with them . " Ella disappeared into the back of the house . Mrs. Tavistock came down , a heavy , small woman with a large head and strong features . She motioned Clara into the parlor , and in that motion , half dismissal , Clara realized that the woman was according her a position she did n't feel Clara deserved : I am seating you in my  | parlor , but you actually belong in my kitchen . Not even Mrs. Sanders in San Pablo had played the grand lady in that way . Clara became aware of her hands and began to hold them in the way Father had described as genteel . Having settled her guest in the ornate parlor and ordered tea , Mrs. Tavistock considered her duties as a hostess discharged and made little effort at conversation . Clara was thrown back to the hints Father had dropped about genteel behavior in Virginia : One appreciated the appointments of a room but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in small talk . " How long have you and Mr. Tavistock lived in Gold Flume ? " Clara began . It was n't the right question . The woman answered , her voice intense and hitter . They had come here fifteen years ago , and promises had been made . There was a hiss in the words : " senior-ity , " " advancement , " " mansion residence . " No one knew that the telephone would eclipse the telegraph and that private cars would increase at the expense of train travel . Here they were , fifteen years in this . . . place , a place they had planned as a stopover . Tea came . It was an elaborate silver service , but Clara noticed it was badly polished and without the strainer . Her father 's eye , complete with mote , took it all in . " If one can afford silver , " his voice rang in her head , " one can afford silver polish . " Oreo cookies lay in the plate . Father would have thrown them across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were doorstops . " But they drank and Clara made the usual murmurs of appreciation , coming at last to the purpose of the visit . " I teach your Peter and Lucinda , but you and I have n't met . When I replaced Miss Optegard , it was so sudden that ? " " The slut was pregnant . Schoolteacher ! An illiterate slut was teaching our children , " Dorothy Tavistock reddened with indignation , " a woman who could n't speak a sentence without  | drowning in the grammar . Did you ever meet her  --  see her clothes ? Gulch , Gulch born and bred . Her fingernails ! Did you see them ? " The Gulch again . The woman was so angry that she failed to notice her guest 's expressions , the pallor and the blush that followed it , and by the time she did look , Clara had recovered herself . " I replaced Miss Optegard , " Clara persevered , " and I began to teach Peter and Lucinda . It seemed to me that I should know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole family together , but that 's not always possible . I 'm happy that we arranged this meeting . " " It is appropriate that we talk , " Mrs. Tavistock said . " I wanted to tell you that Peter often returns from school in a ragged and bruised condition . He is fighting at school and I want that stopped . " Clara took a breath to answer , carefully . " I know he fights . I do n't allow that in school and I often talk about the problem with the children , but there 's no way to stop it outside of school . To some degree Peter encourages it . His manner is lofty , and he never lets anyone forget that his parents have a high position in town . " The woman stared at Clara . " Am Ito understand that you are blaming Peter for being bullied ? " Clara only said , " I do n't think things will continue this way . Peter is on the edge , between fighting the bullies and joining them . This is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are frightened of being picked on . " She stopped herself from saying , " My brother used to be ... " Mrs. Tavistock made no response , but an iciness settled in the room and Clara saw that her hostess had interpreted her frankness as a violation of etiquette . There was still the book to give . For a moment she hesitated , thinking that she should n't give it , that the situation had gone wrong and anything more would make  | it worse , but she had given books to everyone else and she had selected a book of stories that both Peter and his sister , Lucinda , might read with pleasure . " I brought this for them ... to help them keep up their reading skills over the summer .... " And she laid the book gently on the tea table next to the tray . Dorothy Tavistock 's expression froze and there was a long silence . " This home is plentifully supplied with reading matter , " she said . Clara , stung , was tempted to ask why she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it in her purse , rose with the standard words of leavetaking , and made her escape , thinking as she departed that she might have done better , much better , but thinking back on it , she did n't see how . The other Town visits were friendly and easy , and the sting of the Tavistock visit faded . In July , Clara and Andy got horses and went up the gulches to the Bodas , the Covingtons , and the Markhams . The Bodas ran stock and did a little halfhearted mining on Little Annie Creek . Mrs. Boda was a dried-up , skittery woman whose English was so thick that even Clara , experienced in understanding heavily accented English , could barely make out her meaning . Clara taught two of the Boda children , Cyril in the elementary grades , a grim , silent child , and Sulo , the older boy . He was a glowering presence in the classroom , diminished here in the presence of his father , a man the size of an ox . When Clara introduced herself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sulo and planted his hands on the boy 's shoulders , digging his fingers into them . It was only when she gave the hook that his suspicions were somewhat assuaged . " To read until school starts again . " " Yes , " the man said , " yes , " and the family went faint with relief . In all those outlying places , the gulches or the ranches , it was the most ordinary politeness to be asked to stay for a meal , but  | Clara was n't asked there . She left as soon as she could , hurrying to meet Andy , who had been waiting just off Bodas ' holding . A week later they rode up Whiskey Gulch to the Covingtons , and there Clara met Mae Covington and realized why Mama had had such a hunger for bangles and bright clothes and shiny things  --  habits and choices for which Father had often laughed at her . Isolation had silenced the Bodas ; it made Mae Covington talk on and on . Clara had wanted to hint to Mae that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , but seeing Mae , she did n't have the heart . They visited the Markhams and afterward rode slowly down the gully of Chinaman 's Creek , listening to the summer . Birds streaked here and there , crying their identities and warnings across the landscapes . Insects flew up from the horses ' hooves . Water was flowing somewhere , a clucking sound against small stones like augurers casting signs . The voice in the mind droned on . This was Clara 's familiar landscape , her chosen home . She noticed the ripening of raspberries and buffalo berries , the Oregon grape and the alpine currant . For all the beauty that was here and all the grandeur of these places the Gulch families , her own included , were sad and isolated . They were like the stunted trees that are gray even in summer . She wondered if such a crippling could happen to the family she and Andy were making . How had it happened to all those people , each so differently ? How had it happened to her parents ? In August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fourway Mountain and rested on the saddle . There were so mans ' barns , outbuildings , and houses , it was like a settlement . Clara had I seen towns smaller than the Ditmars ranch . There was a mood of lively interest in her visit . When they had lunch , the fathers and mothers , and the top hand , whose son was also at school , it was a huge picnic . Mrs. Ditmars laughed . " Your timing is perfect  --  on a ranch this is the only two weeks ' lull we get all year . "  | So she found the Bogards at leisure also . They were n't as wealthy as the Ditmarses , but they were closer to town on a smaller , prettier piece of land . Alice Bogard was a few years older than Clara , and two of her four children were already at school . She laughed when Clara noted it . " We were considered essential to the war effort , and I guess that included starting a family early . I sometimes fell asleep standing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun-tightened and there were wrinkles at the outsides of her eyes and a mouth that liked to laugh . When her husband Carl took Andy to see the ranch , the two women went up to Alice 's sewing room , which Clara saw was full of books . They began chatting about what they liked , Alice favoring history and biography , Clara fiction and literature . Alice kept a list . " I 'm going to do that , too ! " Clara was writing as she said it . " I liked Willa Optegard , " Alice said , smiling , " but I 'm so glad you 're here , now . " " When do you come to town ? " Clara asked her . " Most Saturdays , " Alice said . Clara broke her first rule . " Stop down at our place when you come and we 'll trade books . " " Come up here in two more weeks and we 'll go out after chokecherries . " Then Alice said , " I know you 're not supposed to socialize with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so long to wait and too much to ask in so small a world as ours is . " Later they went out to join the men . Clara saw that Andy was enjoying Carl Bogard 's company . " He 's got interesting ideas about how domestic animals change the habits and ranges of wild ones . And he knows lots of local geology . I asked him to come with me next time I go up Hungry Woman . " That fall , Milvin French and Sulo Boda did n't return to school . Kester French attacked a girl in Bluebank and was then found dead in Crow Creek near his own place , drowned in six inches of water . The sheriff came from Aureole to investigate ,  | noted a general relief at Kester 's passing , and pursued no clues beyond Kester 's proven drunkenness . The Frenches complained bitterly at the sketchy questioning of the girl 's brothers and the town 's disinterest . What had he been doing in Crow Creek 's narrowest , rockiest place ? The town took no time forgetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barriers . " I have news , " Andy said when he came home one evening . It was late fall and they had a fire in the cabin . " It 's good and bad . The good news is that there 's a refinery coming in near here . There 'll be jobs for people and a new chance for this side of the valley . The bad news is that it will be high on Placer Gulch , at your old place , and by the time they 're through , there wo n't be much left of it . Let 's borrow a camera and take pictures before the place is changed and gone . " They were too late . A week went by , and another , and by the time they borrowed the camera and went up the gulch , earthmovers had gone up from the bottom and down from the top and wiped out the Coleman cabin , the yard , and the road . Mama 's hideaway cave had been uncovered and blasted open , so that it gaped like a looted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gulch had been spared . Tessie had been away , helping one of her daughters with a baby , and when she returned , the view across the gulch had been changed forever . At the top of the road was the graveyard . Clara , Tessie Rubano , Katy , and her sister Jean went up the next day to ask the engineer to save it . " If you would move the road over just a few yards ? " " Lady , I seen the grave markers " ? he looked scornfully at the combination of bricks , name-scratched stones , cuts of wooden shoring beams with numbers and names burned on ? " but the head office looked and this place was n't registered nowhere as a graveyard site , so we 've got orders to go through it . " " Give us a day to ? " " Sure . We ai n't scheduled to do this until next week . "  | They called the head office , and an executive said a man would be sent out and some adjustment made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine or more graves were on a site and/or three or more families were represented , the place had the legal standing of a graveyard . There were fifteen graves representing nine families . But during the night the earthmovers had gone in , and when Clara and Andy went up to take measurements and survey the site , it had been erased . The graveyard was now a turnaround for the ore trucks going into the refinery . Up at the Bogards ' she told Alice , " I could n't even picture it the way it used to he . None of the landmarks were left . " Alice stared at Clara . " What was your maiden name ? " " Coleman . " " Was your father an assayer ? Was he a difficult man ? " " He was an assayer , but not difficult , impossible . " " I think Carl 's dad knew him . " Grandfather Bogard did indeed remember Winston Coleman and Marlena . He had done some prospecting around the gulch and he even had a few pictures from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began working their way through the collection . There were pictures of the classes from Callan School , and in one of them , Clara saw herself standing grimly in a faded dress with a torn collar . She was looking straight out . Clara did n't remember the dress or the day , but she was surprised at the coolness , the expressionlessness , in the girl 's face . She almost said , " That was the year after the Knowing . " Later , Andy said , " I never had a home place . Bad as yours was , there are links , memories . It makes you a person , not just a floating mass . I envied you and Alice up to the snoot in pictures . " " Do n't you have any family pictures ? " " None . Arlo traveled light , and pictures identify people , and identity is no good for a con man . For me it 'll have to begin here , pictures and identity . I 've been doing more and more pri-  | vate work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to leave the county and go on my own . Then you can take my picture and put it in an album . " " Why wait ? I 'll borrow the Bogards ' camera . " The pictures showed Andy in front of their cabin , then on the main street in front of the bank . He wore his only white shirt and tie . Clara posed in front of Gold Flume 's schoolhouse and then standing in the shade of the porch . A passerby took the pictures of them standing together in front of the church . Clara 's face had a drawn , abstracted look , and there were shadows under her eyes . Alice Bogard had said that many pregnant women had that drawn look and those shadows .  | The people building the refinery began to come . Architects and engineers and their families filled the ' hotel and the better houses in Gold Flume . Construction workers parked trailers on t he flats , brick masons and heavy equipment operators , steel and cement workers came . Aureole drew some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the towns stirred , woke , and stretched . In Bluebank someone reopened the old grocery store and swept the corners for rat droppings . The Gold Flume hank got itself a new facade . The county library brought a branch to the deserted feed store . 89  | Then , two Aureole men , veterans , brought a group of investors to town with plans for building a small ski area . They had bought up the west and south faces of Bad Axe Mountain and the west and north sides of Hurrah . South of town , the mountains stepped back and the valley widened , and just at that opening , a sunny but windy funnel , the builders hoped to place their parking lots and a big lodge . Andy was asked to do the survey for the area , mountainsides and plain . After the survey the planners asked him to stay on because of his knowledge of the miniclimates of both those slopes . He quit his job at the county and began to work on the locations of lifts and tows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be out of the higher winds . " We 'll be rich soon , " he declared importantly to Clara . " We 're going to buy this cabin , " and he watched her face go stark before he began to laugh . The population of Gold Flume had almost doubled , with ski area planners and refinery people , but the new people had no plans to stay and they did n't care about the mountains or the town ; they had come from similar jobs in Stowe and Alta , and from Texas and Oklahoma , and they would be gone as soon as their parts of the projects were finished . Unlike Town people , they did n't try to keep their habits or their hungers secret , having no reputations to maintain . Their children filled , then overwhelmed , the valley schools . Clara 's classes had ten more children , then eighteen , then twenty-six , coming in through the school year . The pressure forced Aureole to speed up its plans for a consolidated district . After the Christmas holidays , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the new Aureole High School , but Clara would still he teaching in an overcrowded room . To the Town children , the refinery students seemed the most worldly-wise and sophisticated of beings . The boys wore black , studded leather jackets , and chains instead of belts . Their hair  | was plastered to their heads and they chewed gum continually , milling away like cattle . Clara classed it with snuff and forbade it and had to withstand their glowering doom-looks and muttered curses . The boys were insolent and arrogant , the girls louder and more strident than Gold Flume girls , aggressive in their dress and gestures . In those days a Ranch child might still come to school on horseback ; the older refinery boys rode motorcycles , which they gunned for long minutes before they rotated their black-gauntleted wrists and sped away , huddling girls glued to their backs . Before Clara 's pregnancy began to show , she wrote the required letter to the school board informing them . The county rule said that no teacher could he in the classroom after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugstore  --  the Percivals had no phone  --  and left the message that her letter would not be officially received . " We do not think your condition is sufficiently advanced . ' Your condition wo n't be sufficiently advanced until the end of the school year . The Gold Flume board must have told the super they wanted you to stay . You suit the town , and they know it . " Clara and Andy were doing the dishes , standing side by side at the sink . " Does the town suit you ? " she asked , and turned to him and put her wet hands on his shoulders . He laughed . " It does , yes , it does . " They knew Gold Flume and its people fairly well by now ? they knew who was dependable , who was neighborly , who drank in secret , who was cheating on a husband and who on a wife . They knew which neighbors would prosper with the new boom and which would stay as they were . Some of what Clara knew came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be guarded and which were not . They came to her with the daily talk she could n't stem , and held it up to her as one would tell a story . " Daddy was drunk again and he puked all over .  | Mama said with all the money it took he should try harder to keep it down . " " Mattie shot a cougar in our chicken run last night but when she went to see , it was Bud French . She said , I 'm sorry , Mr. French , I thought you were a cougar . ' " Andy saw a notice posted for a lease with option on the Steadman place . It was a homestead on what had once been a quarter section , a mile beyond the northwest edge of town . The county had built a road up and over Jackass Pass and the road had cut the original tract in two parts . The house and twelve acres were on the western side . Half the Ute ran there under the name of Jackass Creek . Andy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd of prospective buyers . There were none . Although he had never met Andy and Clara , John Steadman knew about them . He sat them down and wound away the afternoon telling them about homesteading days and his grandparents . At dusk they talked business and by dark Clara and Andy had changed status . It delighted Clara that the criminal 's son and the fantast 's daughter were going to have a home , to be a family , to live in a place and belong to it . Outside , at the car , she said , " It 's two miles from the school and I can walk that . " When no acknowledgment came , she glanced over at Andy , who was standing at the back , fussing with something in the trunk . " Andy ? " He let down the lid and in the light from the window , she saw the glint of tears . On the afternoon they were to move , an icy rain was falling and it was perilous underfoot . Andy strung a rope from the cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it as she moved what things they had from the cabin . " There may be more storm coming , " he said . " Let 's wait till things clear . " " Nothing doing . I 've waited eleven years to have a home and I do n't want to wait one more day . "  | " The truck may not make it if this gets deep " That 's why we should go now . There is a big fireplace up there and we have wood ready . " They were both carrying their table when a blue government car pulled up beside the truck . A man in uniform stepped out and came over . " Andrew Percival ? " " Yes . " The coat had no insignia . Clara looked at the car . Under u.s . GOVERNMENT she read DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS and under that , in small , white letters , PROBATION AND PAROLE . Andy had seen it , too . " Damn , " he muttered , " it 's Arlo . " They put down the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved ? " " If you could spare a minute , sir . " Andy gave Clara a helpless look . One or two people had gone past , walking gingerly because of the slippery street , but they would notice the government car and read its printing . The man must have asked directions at one or two places . Town would know all about this in an hour , giving the extra time because of the weather . Clara watched Andy sigh , lower his head , wrestle with acceptance , achieve it , and pick up his end of the table . " Let us get this under the tarp . " Then they all went hack into the cabin . Arlo had been selling land he did n't own for the exploration of minerals it did n't contain to men contemplating retirement from the Chicago Police Force . " Cops are as gullible as anyone else , " the officer said , and shrugged . " They had never been out of Chicago . They did n't have the money to come out here and see for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reports your father showed them . " " What land was he selling ? " " Ranch sites with mountain backgrounds so the buyers could H uI stock and mine for whatever minerals they wanted . " " And orchards for their wives to harvest ? "  | " Why not ? " " Bad land , desert land , and no water ? " " None . None at all . " They sat then , Andy glumly , Clara wanting to laugh a little at the victims ' gullibility , that no one had thought to send someone out to check the site . At last Andy said , " Parole , right ? " " He 's just done two years of a three to seven on four counts of fraud . He never used the mails , but it was interstate , so the jurisdiction was ours . If we ca n't parole him , he 'll have to do the full fall . " " Damn ! " Andy ground his fist against his mouth . " Damn him ! I wo n't sign it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . to the con man 's museum ; the man must be the oldest crook in the system . " The officer waited patiently while Andy raged . Clara thought he must have been through this many times , waiting out relatives ' angers . When Andy finally turned to her , Clara said , " Let 's invite this officer to join us for some coffee . We 'll have a room for Arlo now . He wo n't be a bother . If we do n't sign for him , his imprisonment would be our sentence , not the government 's . " Andy seethed some more , then he quieted , and finally he signed . Arlo Percival became their responsibility , like the house . Their triumphal afternoon ended in sulk and accusation . When they finally got the truck loaded and drove up to the Steadman house , their house , night had come . " He 's an old man now , " Clara said . " Maybe he 's slowed down and then he 'll be a help with the baby and maybe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , buying secrets from the kids ? Why does n't he die and leave us alone ? " " You do n't mean that .... " He faced her and his look cowed her . " You still think he 's a sweet old man with a little peccadillo , a lovable scamp who stumbles now and then . He 's a criminal , a menace . He would take my  | savings and yours , take this house , use our reputations , convert everything to cash and be gone without a backward glance . " " We ca n't let him rot in prison . " They unloaded the truck in silence and then Andy said , " I ca n't stay here .... I 'll call you , " and left in the car . Instead of the celebration they had planned , Clara spent the night unpacking alone . Andy was gone for two days . Ile called her from Aureole , wretched and reconciled . " He has n't done it to you yet ; I 'd forgotten that . He has n't taken your hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and laughed at you for running after the shreds . You 'll learn , that 's all . " The old man got off the early train and stood on the platform surveying the town . He turned around all the way , taking all of it in . Andy did n't greet him . " Hello , Dad , " Clara said . She thought he looked smaller but jaunty , prison-dapper in his tight , government-made suit . The prison haircut was a shave halfway up his head and it had destroyed the iron-gray inane she had admired at the hospital . " Hello , Daughter . Is there a new generation on the way ? " And he smiled that incandescent smile that included her among the vast joys he knew . She felt suddenly understood , approved of , wrapped in his sympathy . Beside her , Andy muttered , " Jesus ! " " You look well fed , " Clara said . He nodded complacently . " I am . The federal places are inspected , you know . They have to give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He took out a sheaf of papers . " You 'll need to sign this , a receipt for me , and send it in . They do have a post office in this burg , I hope . I 'll need a few bucks , fifty 'd get me to Ocala  --  that 's in Florida . I 've got a business opportunity waiting for me down there . The Feds wo n't check on me right  | after you 've sent this in , and when they get around to it , tell them the truth . I blew . If they pick me up down there , it 'll be a federal slammer , not one of those Florida chain-gang county places . Col-orado 'll never extradite . " Then he gave a self-satisfied nod . " When will you be leaving ? " Andy said with a piercing look at Clara , who had worked hard to make a room livable for Arlo . " Tomorrow 's train . " He turned to Clara . " Daughter , you 're getting lovelier every day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of awe at their luck , their success or prosperity , she was to be disappointed . She had taken quick , covert looks at him as they started up the Jackass Pass road , a turn and then two others , coming into the little meadow where the house stood . It was late morning ; a raw mist was beginning to gather in the valley . The first snows had come in September . Then they had had the long sweetness of Indian summer . She thought , It might snow again , maybe tonight . She pointed to the greater portion of the meadow and began to explain to Arlo that the Steadmans had sold the land on the far side of the road to a developer and that soon houses would be going up there , and a paved road . " Who would live out here ? " he murmured , looking blankly and then shrugging . They went into the house . It was ranch style , a log house chinked with mortar . It had a big , central living room with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from the original rectangle to give it a cruciform shape . Arlo made no comments . He had one bag , which Andy pointedly let him carry . Andy 's anger was chilling the air . Clara showed her father-inlaw how the Steadmans had made the adjustments that allowed more light into the heart of the house . He looked , making no comment but seemingly oblivious to the mood his son was creating . After a short conversation with Clara about dinner , Andy went into his workroom . Clara took Arlo to the room she had prepared .  | " The boy 's eager to see my back , " Arlo said . Clara saw that dissembling would n't help . " The two of you are very different , and there 's Andy 's past , " she said . " Different is right . " Arlo snorted . " I would n't stay in a house like this in a burg like this fifteen minutes unless it was to meet a mark . " Against all reason , Clara found herself disappointed . He went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from anywhere and miles from anywhere you can get any-where . " He looked at Clara and shook his head . " When I was younger , I thought people got stuck in places like this . I never thought anyone would choose them . Lately it 's come to me that people really are different , I mean beyond the different lies they tell themselves . " And there was that smile , playful , intimate . " I like action , " he said . " I like to go places and do things . I skate on thin ice . Now and then I fall in . So what ? " He gestured toward Andy 's workroom . " Gutless in there never wanted to be anything but safe . You " ? and he winked at Clara ? " you 're a little different . " She felt the embarrassment of someone who has been caught at a forbidden act . She wanted to defend Andy , but a defense would dignify Arlo 's description of him . She faced him with what she hoped was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel 's location or its staff , but you did need someplace to go . " There was no chastening , not even a wavering of his glance , only a great laugh . " Not romantic , not a bit . Realistic , that 's you , Daughter . You 'd be a hard mark . " " Could you get to me , though ? " " Sure , anyone can be gotten to . Yours is probably helping folks , widows and orphans . You 're trying hard because I 'm kin now , and kin 's important to you , too , but you 'll check the house after I 'm gone to see there 's nothing stolen . " " Honesty is the best policy , " Clara said , beginning to enjoy herself .  | He laughed again . " Good God , Daughter , nobody believes that ! " Arlo had disappeared the next morning , even before Andy had filled out the affidavit and the paperwork on his parole . " Damn him ! This is one more time he 's made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and marks to con for him ! " Andy grieved for two days and Clara watched him suffer . " Stop being sad , " she said . " He 's not . The prison people know what he is  --  you 're the only one hurting , the only one who should n't be . " " What do you want me to do ? " " Take me out for a fancy meal at the new place in Aureole . Let 's show them all ! " " Show them what ? " " Show them that sudden wealth can turn our heads and make us cave in to all the materialism we say we hate . "  | More and more students came . They filled all the chairs Clara put between the rows at the back of the room , but despite the crowding , she felt ever more isolated as a teacher . In the world outside , new methods were being developed , new materials coming into use . Gold Flume School had been set adrift with Clara as its only guide . Where was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a teachers ' magazine , and she could barely read the articles without a pang of envy for what those teachers took for granted , and for the materials she saw advertised , the maps and numbering rods and abacus frames .  | She began to think the class itself might fashion some of those things that would work even though they would be crude and even ugly . It would be a job to make the numbering rods  --  they would have to measure , mark , cut , and finish upwards of four hundred cubes and rods . She gave the task to the older boys . Milvin French 's brother Buster was still in school and idle . She could put him to work . Sulo Boda 's brother , Cyril , was his age , and there were Orval Bordereau and Peter Tavistock . The boys took up the work , and to Clara 's astonishment , Cyril became the one they followed . The boy , barely literate after parts of seven years of school , listened to Clara 's descriptions and seemed to wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lumberyard in Aureole and gave them to the boys , and Cyril began to measure and then to cut carefully , allowing for kerf and the drift of the saw , clamping the stock together as Clara would n't have thought of doing . She had expected Peter Tavistock to lead , his family being the social elite of the town . Sulo and Milvin , the school 's principal bullies , had gone , and Peter was a big boy . He had joined the younger boys against the refinery group as she had predicted , but he was out of his element with tools . Cyril worked alone , asking help from no one and accepting it from no one . A rumor got around that Mrs. Percival was making baby blocks and Clara had to give a demonstration of what the rods and cubes were for . Dr. Pratt visited the school one afternoon late in November . He was now one of three doctors in the valley . A shy , bookish man , he had come during the war . He had told Alice Bogard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died of asthma . " He did n't die , " Alice said , " so neither did Billy Bordereau fallen in the river . Before he came you would have had to use Doc Thompson , the vet , or neighbor women . " Clara remembered Mama 's dying and shivered . Dr. Pratt settled himself on one of the cramped benches and asked her how the chil-  | dren were behaving toward her now that the town knew of her pregnancy . Clara had not heard that word used in the valley . People said " in a condition " or " in the family way . " " It 's been gradual , so no one noticed at first , " Clara said . " The children began to hear rumors and then there was some sniggering and shame , but I began to talk about the baby and how I felt , and I 've sent for some pictures of fetuses in various stages . I think as long as I 'm going to be here and will be obviously pregnant , we might as well have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are what I 've been waiting for . " He described the girl he had just lost from a self-inflicted abortion , his third that year . The girl was fifteen . " You 're going to know about it soon enough . When they 're Gulch girls or people like the Frenches , Town shrugs and says , It 's all they deserve . ' This was one of the Hoven girls  --  you might have had her in your class . " Clara put her hand to her mouth . " Oh  --  she was sick  --  she was out sick . " " She was out infected and slowly bleeding to death . She had n't told her family  --  they thought it was flu . I need a way to tell parents what 's happening  --  we have to teach the children ? " She was skeptical and he saw it . His voice gained urgency . " By the time they get to adolescence , there 's too much in the way ? yearning , myths , and nonsense . I want to come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen and heard from their own children . " Clara sighed with relief . She had thought he wanted her to teach the parents , to stand in front of them and make a declaration . " I do n't have all the parents at all the meetings , " she said . " Some never come . " " We 'll take anyone we can get , " he said . As she introduced Dr. Pratt and sat down , Clara wondered whether he would point to the Gold Flume teacher herself , vul-  | nerable in her condition . She was suddenly frightened . What if the parents complained to the superintendent ? She might be dismissed . Although she was only four months into her pregnancy , she was carrying big and , but for the convenience of the board , would have left the school a month ago . Willa Optegard had been removed after six years of service because of a pregnancy . The doctor 's subject was sex , and the people of Gold Flume , conventional in little else , were deeply conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He spoke candidly , using words many people in Gold Flume had never spoken , even in private , of infections , botched abortions , suicide . Clara saw the stir of bodies in the small chairs and heard boots scraping on the wooden floor , as Gold Flume made the motions of its discomfort . Their faces showed nothing . It was n't facts that made everyone uncomfortable . Gossip about girls getting caught had gone on for years . No young woman who died in the valley was ever said to have died of anything but fever and never believed to have died of anything but complications of pregnancy . The problem was the doctor 's vocabulary , the words denoting body parts and functions , in public , in mixed company . He went on as though he had n't noticed their shifting and the scrape of work boots . He talked about the boys , too , about suicides done out of fear and ignorance . The restlessness increased . People coughed and cleared their throats . Some were pale . He spoke about the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bodies . When he finished there was dead silence . It occurred to Clara then that she had the power to open these people to some of their own hypocrisy . Their discomfort might be genuine , but many people were hiding ugly secrets . She knew who drank in secret , who beat his children beyond what even Town felt was right , who took his daughters or allowed his sons to take them . This room , crossed with belliger-  | ent stares , was holding its pride before it like a shield . Behind it was fear . She spoke . " The sad thing I see is that children are learning the facts of life from other children , spreading the ignorance even wider . " Someone muttered , " Who 'll tell all this to the Frenches ? " and there was release in a wave of nervous laughter . The Frenches never came to parents ' meetings or church . They took no part in Gold Flume . The Bodas and the other Gulch people lived too far away ; the Legrands attended sporadically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legrand and Buster French hip deep in one another behind the boys ' privy . Both of them were fifteen and should have been in the high school in Aureole , but they had been kept back so many times that their education would end for them at sixteen without their ever having left Gold Flume School . She had talked with Frances after school . The girl , sullen and angry , was defensive of what she called being In Love . Love . She had been lying on hard ground  --  only Buster had had a soft bed  --  and they must have gone at it quickly , furtively , without a tender touch or a stroking hand or a whispered word , eye into eye . " It ai n't a sin  --  Buster 's going to marry me . " " I do n't say it 's a sin , but I say it 's foolish . How can Buster marry you ? He has no job . You 've grown up at the Frenches ' . Do you want to move in there ? " Frances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of children unready for growing up . " He has to marry me . He says we 'll go to Denver , and until then , he 'll get on at the refinery . " Clara could n't imagine any sensible employer hiring Buster to handle expensive equipment . Frances was brighter than Buster ; what did she see in him ? " Frances , Buster drinks . If you get pregnant , you wo n't be able to stay in school . Is the sex that good ? " Frances looked at Clara in amazement and then shook her head , slowly . " Why do it then ? "  | " Buster wants it . He needs it . Men need it , and Buster chose me . " Clara did n't have the heart to say , " Over whom ? " Clara looked at a rancher near her , whose jaw was working with disapproval . She looked down the row at other ranchers and at the wives , stolid and silent beside their men . Which of them had been in Frances 's fix a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ? Dr. Pratt was still arguing earnestly , intently , with Bud Bordereau and the Ditmarses . Clara agreed that there should be some simple information given the children , but how could a curriculum act on a mind like Frances 's , like Buster 's ? Could any teaching bridge the jealousy , lust , frolic , yearning of those years , or the yearning to stay in ignorance that girls like Frances had ? Arithmetic was hurled against the walls of their resistance , Clara wrangled English . How could she touch spirits as different as Buster 's , Orval 's , Cyril Boda 's ? Lucinda Tavistock was shy and sensitive ; her arrogant and angry brother , Peter , would defend against words aimed at his fears and needs . Then there were the refinery children , who knew all the facts and functions and names with a crude heartlessness she found embarrassing . She wondered how she herself would have responded to the subject when she was their age , hardened against the sacrifices and surrenders that love is . She thought , At that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know how to surrender without abjectness . She wanted to try to make the parents remember their own school days . Were n't teaching and learning like a war ? For hours or days , students are either allies or enemies . The campaign often goes slack and everyone is mired down in facts . What a struggle it is to awaken feeling , to get the students to see into the lives and motives of the historical figures they studied , to grasp the harmonies of arithmetic and its beauty , to understand the  | ideas of the great writers . She could say none of this to the parents , so she sat and listened to Dr. Pratt and then drifted off into a fantasy . Her child would know .. . After the meeting she walked home in the dark . Andy was worried about her falling and made her take a powerful flashlight , but she rarely used it . She knew he was frightened about this baby . She had felt the fear first as reserve , then withdrawal . Perhaps he was repelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked him if that was true , he said , " God , no , it 's fear . I do n't want to be a father , or to lose you . That 's shameful , is n't it , small , " and he shook his head . " If you talked about this , the words would come out in a little buzzing voice , like an insect , because it 's a little , buzzing thing . " The December night was cold but not windy . There would soon be more snow , but for the moment the winter 's long shackle had loosened . She stopped at the first overlook , a little pull-off on the Jackass Pass road , and looked down at the town , now mostly dark . She was still hearing Andy as he spoke slowly . " It was so hard to take off my clothes in front of you that first time . I was showing you a naked man , but that naked man was me  --  knock-knees and my skinny polio leg . The face had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arlo . I told you about him . I got the courage to do that , too . " She had understood . " We 're going to be a family and we 'll have the courage to do that , too . " " Yes , " he murmured , " I guess we will . " The months passed but the board made no attempt to remove Clara from her position . A few parents looked askance , but the children were used to the pregnancy and seemed eager for the birth of the baby . Even the bullies accorded her a rough gallantry when she asked for help . On May 29 , school ended and Andy left Gold Flume for a convention in Denver . His college friends would be there and  | he could get some relief from feeling closed away in a valley while the rest of the world grew and changed . He had offered to stay behind , but she knew he was tired of her baby plans and preoccupations . Clara had just lowered her hand from saying good-bye when she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took to be the baby 's moving . She took up the ladder and began to caulk the corners where the roof met the chimney . The cramp came again . She thought of a possible reason , dismissed it , and went back to caulking the roof . When the intervals became shorter , she stopped work , got down , and called Dr. Pratt . Andy had taken the car and the doctor told her he would come and drive her to the clinic in Aureole . When he arrived and examined Clara , he said they would n't make it . Clara remembered that Alice Bogard came to town on Saturdays , so Pratt called the drugstore . The pharmacist 's wife found Alice and both of them came up and helped deliver a healthy , full-term baby . By the time Andy reached Denver , he was the father of a daughter . Clara had seen babies born in Spanish Town and had long night-thoughts about Mama bearing hers in the dank , unheated cabin with no water . But it was n't until she lay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old terror she had kept at bay with work and denial overwhelmed her and she began to tremble and sob . " Women get emotional at these times , " Dr. Pratt said , but Alice , who knew something of Clara 's past , silently went over and held her while the trembling spread itself and then spent itself and diffused into triumph , and then into sleep . When Andy called that evening , the party line all picked up on Percivals ' ring and cheered him with the news . Alice told Andy she would stay with Clara . " The party line 's still talking to him , no doubt , even though I excused myself and hung up . " She chuckled . " They 'll fill him in on all the details . Can I help you stand ? You might want to clean up a little . "  | " I do n't want this baby to grow up the way I did , " Clara murmured as though she had not been listening . Alice nodded . " There 's little chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were serious . Clara was murmuring , " She wo n't be demeaned or laughed at . Her clothes wo n't shame her . Her father 's scorn wo n't humiliate her . If she 's got a love of learning , she 'll be encouraged , and when she goes to college , it wo n't be as a beggar or starving . " Alice 's older children were in high school . She smiled at Clara and helped her up . " It 's a healthy baby , " she said . " It 's a good start . " Andy came back the next day . " I could n't stay down there . I could n't pay attention to anything . I 'll try next year , maybe , but this is what I need to be listening to now . " Julia Percival had begun to cry .  | Then Clara started back to school , she took Julia with her , and when the baby cried , Clara left the class to Orval Bordereau and went out in the sunny backyard , and facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Frances Legrand was showing . A little belly , high and firm , was beginning underneath the light dresses she wore . " Do you know you are going to have a baby ? " Clara had kept her after school on a pretext . Frances muttered something . Clara continued closing the windows and lowering the blinds . She listened to the vagueness and passivity in Frances 's voice  | and wanted to shake the girl . " Does your mother talk to you about this ? " " She do n't know . " " Ca n't she see ? " " She do n't look . " " You know the rule , Frances ; when you get noticed , you 'll have to leave . " Frances had started to cry . " I want to stay in school . " Clara drummed her fingers . Frances liked to read , and school meant order , limits , a measure of peace . " I 'll keep you here as long as I can . What about Buster ? " Buster was still registered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was free to leave . " We 'll be married as soon as people say I have to go . " Then she dried her eyes , confident that with Clara 's support , everything would be solved . Clara had no heart to wake her up . " You ca n't stay in school and be married , " she said . Frances gave her a penetrating look , and Clara felt her face go hot . She had been in the classroom and she had been pregnant . She kept her own baby in the schoolroom every day . " It 's the rule , " Clara protested . Frances faced her with all the courage and self-delusion of her fifteen years . " I 'll wait till I ca n't be here no more and then Buster and me 'll get married and then he 'll get on at the refinery . That 's good money and we 'll get us a trailer like them refinery people 's got . " Buster would be sixteen with a wife and baby and no one who knew him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no use arguing with Frances . Clara took a breath and said , " Winter 's coming and you 'll want to be wearing big sweaters and working jackets . Shut Buster 's mouth . Tell people you 're overeating . I wo n't notice anything , but do n't wear those tight dresses . " " I get sick mornings , " Frances said .  | " It stands to reason , " Clara answered , " overeating the way you do . " When the refinery people had started to come , Clara petitioned the county school board for a new school . The board said it would give her temporary buildings , but when the ski area began to grow and hotels and shops opened , the school board voted a new building . That winter , Clara went to Aureole three times for meetings with the architects who were designing it . They were not eager to hear from her , but she knew she would feel responsible if the building lacked convenience and access because she had n't been there to speak of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was to be the new school 's principal . There was to be a room for each class , six grades instead of eight , with six teachers and an office and a telephone and a gymnasium-auditorium with equipment for sports and plays . There would be inside bathrooms and running water . There would be closets for storing equipment . There would be privacy , warmth in winter , a janitor , and paving against the dust of spring and fall and the mud and slush of the colder months . Above all there would be company , other teachers , younger teachers who would know all the ways of doing things she could only read about . Had the paradox she had stniggled with in teachers college been resolved ? Would the new generation of educators be able to reconcile the ideas of child as savage with child as angel ? Were there new ways to aid memory and strengthen concentration , link idea with action , sublimate cruelty ? When Clara next saw Alice Bogard and described it all , Alice clapped her hands , laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock and he is n't a butt-patch to you for excitement . Go look at yourself in the mirror , Mrs. Christmas Morning ! "  | Frances Legrand carried high and small and she was in the eighth month before she drew stares when her loose shirts gaped open . One day in February , Clara was in Aureole shopping between snows . Her cart was loaded . She saw Dorothy Tavistock with a full cart moving purposefully down the aisle . It was too late to pretend not to have seen her . " How are you ? " Clara said , and smiled . Mrs. Tavistock pushed her cart past the question and came too close . " I 've heard that there is a young woman at Gold Flume School who is in the condition . It comes of a poor example by the schoolmistress . " Clara 's answer came without thought . " When I first became pregnant , I wrote to the school board and it chose not to receive my letter . " As she heard herself , she was irritated for defending what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students to remain in school . " She had prepared this answer months before and had n't had to use it until now . She smiled and added , " On the grounds , I suppose , that they know too much already . " Dorothy Tavistock moved on , and Clara knew she should n't have said what she did . Relations between them were strained , so it was silly to ruffle her . She had wanted to say , " You remind me of Squire Western 's sister in Tom Jones , " but thought better of it . " What 's put you off your feed ? " Andy said , as she got in the car . " Peter Tavistock 's mother . The duchess of Gold Flume . " It was a week after that Clara was walking home , carrying a hag of books and Julia in a little papoose sling Andy had helped fashion . She was walking briskly in order to beat the dusk home . Another snow had fallen and drawn away , but the northern and eastern sides of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road skirted the town and then petered out for the path Clara 's own feet had made up the hill to the Jackass Pass road . She had started up , parting with the road that sank away below her , a cindery , flat level with some rusted narrow-gauge rails where ore carts had once been loaded . She heard sounds  | she thought came from the deserted place , shouting , someone 's cry . She thought the sound might really be coming from farther down the gully  --  sound travels unevenly in the mountains ; rocks deflect it and an upslope wind might carry it from as far away as town . She went to the verge and looked down . There were people there , and in the almost-dusk , Clara saw Cyril Boda , Dalvin Moore , Frances , and two boys whose backs were to her but whom she knew . One turned a quarter profile  --  Peter Tavistock . It was n't a group of young people , it was four boys and a girl . Frances was facing them , her hands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crouch , a stance of defense and terror . She was too ungainly to run . " Buster will get you for this ! " They had begun to move in on her , rapt as cats . They were so intent on Frances that they did n't hear Clara move down the shaly bank , even though she had Julia and her books and moved clumsily . It flashed through her mind that such clumsiness was uniquely female , a vulnerability that the boys sensed and were exploiting in Frances . She was coming to the group on its left flank , and she came on with a cheery pretense . " Hello , Frances , Peter ; hello , Cyril , Dalvin ; hello , John . Frances , it 's a good thing I ran into you . If you do n't mind leaving your friends for a few moments , there 's something I need to discuss with you . " Without stopping to receive an answer and still talking , Clara pulled Frances up , blocking the boys ' view of her as she did so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing dumbfounded in the positions they had been caught in . " Perhaps you should n't wait  --  this may take a while . " Frances was almost stumbling . Her hands were fisted with fear and rage . " Frances ? " " Buster will kill them , " she whispered vehemently . " Buster will do nothing , " Clara whispered back . " If you stay quiet , you can be out of the eighth grade by the time the baby  | comes . Get noticed and you 'll be out of school and I wo n't be able to help . What were you doing up there ? " Now Frances was sulking . " They said they were going to take me to a cabin where Buster and me could live . " " You did n't really believe that , did you ? " " I thought if they could let us have the cabin we could live there and I would n't have to stay at Frenches ' and we could be together . " They had come to the edge of town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , " Clara said . " A thing has to make sense before you agree to it . Where would four boys get a cabin they had a right to give you ? Why would they want to show it to you alone ? " " I only wanted ? " " Never let what you want stop you from thinking about what they want or what makes sense . " It was all Clara could do not to shake Frances until she relinquished the passive , dreamlike dullness of teenage romantic surrender . Was Juliet so limp and milky ? " I 'm tired , " Clara said , " and it 's late . Do n't let them try to get you alone again . Do n't let them offer you a gold watch that 's really brass or a promise to take you somewhere . Come on , I 'll walk you home . " Frances shook her head . " No one 's there , and they " ? a backward toss of the head ? " know it . " Clara followed the gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following . " Keep walking . " In her papoose case , Julia had begun to fuss . Clara said , " Here 's the baby 's pacifier  --  put it in her mouth . " They came to the town , the street before Main . Clara spotted Abner Matske , loading his truck . She put a hand on Frances 's shoulder , guiding her to where the man stood . " Hello , Abner . Can you take us home ? It 's Steadman 's place . " " Sure , " he said , but he gave them a quizzical look . " School project , " Clara explained . " It got late . " When they pulled out Clara noticed the street was empty .  | Frances stayed the night . Her people had no phone , she said , and she would n't be missed anyway . The next day after school , Clara was on Main Street and stopped by Andy 's office . He said he would take her home at five . She went to the drugstore and chatted with Sallie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My future student , " Clara said , and they laughed together . As they stood talking , the school bus from Aureole came and pulled up in front of the drugstore , and the street was full for a moment . Then the students began to disperse by twos and threes up and down the street . Clara saw Peter Tavistock and with a sign to Sallie to watch Julia , she went out quickly and caught up with Peter , who was walking by himself . " Peter ? " He stared at her . For a moment , she thought he might run . All she had to hold him with was interest and habit . She asked him about school and he warmed a little . Aureole IIigh was interesting , he said . It was " departmental " with a homeroom and a choice of classes . Other students in small groups passed them , giving Peter questioning looks . " Are you on your way home ? " He nodded . " Would you mind my walking with you ? " He shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time of year . They kept their hands in their pockets , with the wind at their backs . Clara said , " Frances Legrand is a good girl . She 's kind and generous and she believes the things people tell her . That 's all right when the people are honest . " He murmured something that sounded like " She 's pussy . " Clara hoped she had heard him correctly . " No one is just any-thing , " she said . " How would you like to be thought of as only what your penis does ? " His reaction was all she could have wished . Shock . She had him . He had stopped walking and had to force himself to start again , trying for a swagger . She continued as though she had n't noticed . " Did you ever hear the phrase Pick on someone your own size ' ? She 's not your size , Peter , she 's  | your age , but she ca n't defend herself because she does n't know how . " He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonchalance . " She needs a brother , " Clara said , working to keep up , " not another attacker . " " She 's got brothers , " he said . " Do any of them look out for her ? " " They practically sell tickets . " " So you figure if no one values her , why should you ? " " Well , yeah . Why pick on me ? " They were almost to his house , crossing the bridge behind the depot . It occurred to Clara that the house had been built near the railroad but would be saved from the fumes and smoke because of the prevailing winds . All the smell and smoke went southward , over the town . " Why pick on you ? Because you 're bright and you have a future few other boys in this town will be able to have . You 'll graduate Aureole High and I do n't think any of the other boys will do that . You 'll probably go on to college and they 'll be stuck here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more than pussy and you 're more than penis . Think about it . " They were at the fence and the complaining gate . Clara smiled at Peter and said good-bye , walking into a wind that brought tears . Back at the drugstore Sallie and Andy were chatting , and Julia was trying to walk . A week later , Clara got a note from ' Mrs. Tavistock , who informed her that she would visit the school that Wednesday afternoon . The tone of the letter was command , not request , which made Clara smile . If the visit concerned Peter 's sister , Lucinda , it would be very welcome . Lucinda was one of the brightest students Clara had ever known . It was a pity that Peter was Mrs. Tavistock 's only interest . There was more to Lucinda than a good memory and a gift for connecting ideas . She had all the signs of a real love of learning , a hunger for the thing itself apart from grade or approval of the teacher , of fame or popular-  | ity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to say to Mrs. Tavistock , that we sometimes walk right past it without recognition . When Dorothy Tavistock arrived , Clara was ready with a sheaf of Lucinda 's papers . Clara opened it and handed one of the papers to the mother with a smile . " Lucinda 's grades are excellent , which you already know , but they do n't reflect all there is to measure about that girl . Her mind ? " Mrs. Tavistock cut Clara off immediately . " I 'm not here to speak of my daughter , but of my son . You were seen accompanying him through town , lecturing him publicly in the street and all the way to his home . " " I walked him home , yes . " " He says you forced him to walk with you . " Clara was briefly annoyed , until the humor of the thing dawned on her . " How did I do that ? " " You had him by the arm , I assume . " " No , I did n't touch him at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . " " I had no idea that my walking a student home was a mark of shame . Most people would see it as a sign of regard . " " But you bullied and scolded him . He told me so . " " I did speak of his behavior . Since he 's in high school , I could n't call him into my office . " " His being in high school means that he is out of your jurisdiction . " " I hope Aureole High confers no special status or removes its students from contact with ordinary people . " " My son demands an apology . " " How do you see me doing that ? Publicly ? By letter ? Any apology would involve a discussion of his behavior , which I found reprehensible , and about which I spoke to him . I would do so again and do so to anyone I saw misbehaving . " " I 'm going to demand you be replaced as teacher and principal of Gold Flume School . "  | Clara tried for dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in her repertoire . " The board meets in Gold Flume and Aureole on alternate first Thursdays of each month . " Mrs. Tavistock left in a temper without asking what her son had done . She told Andy about the visit . " What 's the whalebone-stayed battlewagon up to now ? " he asked . She had n't told him about Frances or the boys , but her worry about Mrs. Tavistock brought it all out . he listened intently , then answered , " She has n't got you , you 've got her . If she tries anything , you can drop the word about her baby boy 's doings . " " You do n't understand . Parents have immense power in our schools . The whole system is based on trust and just the appearance of loss of that trust is enough to sink a teacher . " " The way I see it is this : At home one day , she 'll ask the kid . She wo n't be wearing those tight corsets there , so some blood will get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got no case . Tell me about the new school . " " They start building in the spring , " she said . " We move in the fall . " Mrs. Tavistock did n't pursue the matter . The board meeting came and went and the spring parents ' meeting took place without her . By then the plans for the new school were available and people saw what it would look like and were impressed with its size and features . But Clara 's heart sank when she looked at the architect 's drawings . There was neither the welcoming character of the present schoolhouse , nor the dignity and loftiness of Callan School . Its tan tiles were elementary school generic , as though Gold Flume were interchangeable with any school in Denver , Chicago , or Boca Raton , Florida . But Clara visited the school every week through the spring and summer as it went up beside the old schoolhouse , which was due to be demolished . Foundations were dug , cement and  | rebars placed , framing , inner walls , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged him to use the warm , native stone of Callan School . He refused , and the garish tan tile went on instead . " Friendly spaces , " he said , and the school ended up looking like a store or an office . In June , Frances Legrand fell or was pushed out of a moving car Buster French was driving and had her baby at 4:00 A.M. on a shoulder of road between Bluebank and Callan . Someone took her family to pick her up . Clara , out of school for the summer and busy with the construction and her own second pregnancy , did n't hear about it for a week , by which time Frances was out of danger . Two weeks later , the girl went walking with the baby , Lorus , in Gold Flume . She held him like a shield as she went , the way she had held her books in front of her narrow chest . She was holding him that way when she and Buster were married in Pastor Frailey 's parlor . Frances 's aunt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its grocery and its saloons.  | L hree teachers had been hired . Dean had a large family , settling in Gold Flume ; Lorraine was a spinster , whose move was like a retirement ; Anna was in her first position out of teacher training . Clara had hoped for more spirited people . Only Anna had any glow . None had expected that Principal C. Percival would be a woman . In August they got the classrooms ready , selected furniture , and ordered supplies . Clara 's excitement caught and overwhelmed even the stodgy older woman and everyone opened out in her eagerness . The long hall was turned into a gallery in  | which Clara ordered furring at three levels and chalkboards at three levels for messages and the paragraph autobiographies the older children would write for the younger . She put up her yardstick and its poster : ONE YARD : 1,760 OF THESE MAKE UP ONE MILE . She put up her poster showing one hundred dots , one thousand dots , one million dots . She showed the compass points and the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cutouts of the pint , quart , gallon , and liter . She made a place for a word of the week , a saying of the week . Clara had continued to correspond with the children she had taught in Spanish Town at San Pablo , and to them she poured out all her joy about the new school . The new term began . There were forty-three in three combined classes . There was a school office with a secretary , and Clara 's own office . She had closets for storage , a workroom ; there was a library , and she would be able to fill it with books the children could borrow . The secretary was a Bordereau cousin , a young widow still bleak about the eyes and slow to warm to the children , knowing they would grow up and leave . " She 's efficient , anyway , " Clara told Andy , " and the first- and second-grade teacher is a jewel . " September went into October unseasonably warm . Rain fell , the first rain after August in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dusting off the talk about atomic energy having changed the weather . One noontime the secretary came into the workroom , where Clara was planning class trips , and said that Cyril Boda was in trouble again , fighting . Clara went to the front desk and there he stood , blood pouring from his nose . He was pale , sweating , and disheveled . " Cyril ? " He looked up at her , a familiar look of incredulity and awe . Cyril was ill , very ill indeed . Clara had moved close to him before she thought to wonder what might be ailing him or to worry because of her pregnancy . " Cyril ? " He fell into her arms .  | He was feverish and foul-smelling . He said , " I was n't fighting , Mrs. ? " and then he was out . Clara did n't remember shouting . They called Dr. Pratt . He told them he thought it was typhoid fever and that Cyril was too sick to be taken home . The family had no money for the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janes said they would nurse Cyril at their house . Pratt waved a hand at the office . " And we 're going to have to clean up everything in here and watch everyone with whom he had contact . " The health department came from Aureole and tested and gave inoculations . People worried ; rumors flew back and forth , and some came down with wild and vague complaints , stomachaches and headaches and rashes . Clara stopped in at Janeses ' and saw Cyril , and found him improved . With penicillin , the long course of the illness had been drastically cut . Cyril admitted he had felt ill for a week before collapsing at the office . " Why did n't you tell anyone ? " He stared at her . His father would have beaten him for being lazy . Dr. Pratt rode up Chinaman 's Creek to Bodas ' with three health officers and they must have talked long and hard because the old man came down to Janeses ' with a smoked haunch of antelope , a bushel of his wife 's dried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Aureole for the weekly shopping , Clara met Lennice Janes and they stopped to talk in the aisle . " Doc wants him to stay another week or two because he 's still so weak . " " How is he as a patient ? " " Fine as a patient , not real good as a guest . He puts me off some . " " He 's not rude to you ? " " Oh , no , but there are things folks say when favors are done h r them , you know , a word or two to show the favor is appreciated . I go into his room mornings with a tray . Anyone else would  | say good morning and thank you . Ile never does . Even his friend has trouble with that . " " Friend ? What friend ? " Clara asked . Cyril had always seemed to be a loner . " You had him , the Tavistock boy , Peter . " " Peter ? " Clara had n't seen the two together except for the single time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Peter had enough consideration to visit any sick person . " Yes , its Peter , " Lennice said . " He comes almost every day . He gets off the school bus and comes right over . Mostly , they just sit , the two of them , but lately Peter 's been teaching Cyril to play chess . " She smiled at Clara 's surprise . " Yes , he comes and stays for an hour  --  it would be hard for me to sit that long without talking . Cyril misses him when he does n't come  --  do n't tell me how , but I know it . " Then they nodded over their shopping baskets and walked on , but Clara reported it to Andy in wonder . He grinned . " Ma Tavistock probably does n't know her baby boy is visiting the likes of Cyril every day . I heard Sulo pulled a gun on the last health officer up there . " After school on Monday , Clara walked down into town and stopped at Janeses ' . Lennice came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's up with Cyril now , but he 'll be leaving soon . I know you 're dying of curiosity . " They went into Lennice 's kitchen for coffee and sat for a while , talking . They got up when they heard Peter on the stairs . Clara was standing behind Lennice and Peter stopped halfway down the narrow stairway , seeing her there . " Do you want me to walk you home again ? " Clara asked . He flinched . " It 's all right , Peter . I know you complained to your mother . " " I should n't have done that . " His tone was quiet , the words without drama or bravado .  | " You 're a good friend to Cyril when no one else has been . " " I was n't at first , " Peter said . " I am now . " " How did that happen ? " Clara 's tone was sympathetic . Peter relaxed . " The things you said . " " I did n't say anything about Cyril . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down to the last step and his foot was dangling over the edge , but he did n't want to lose the height . " Cyril really likes Frances , but he does n't know how to be with girls . I just wanted a feel . I knew it was different for him , that what I was doing was n't the same thing he was doing , even though it looked like it . " He was struggling with describing a complex emotion  --  a thing he had never attempted before . " You said she was a real person , and I thought if she was real , so was he . " He was rubbing the banister beside him in his discomfort , a child 's gesture . Clara was at the bottom and Peter did n't want to come any closer . They were conscious of the silence . Lennice had gone back to the kitchen . Peter said , " I hung out with Cyril to get other people 's goat . Then you said that stuff , so I came over here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he saw me . " He was trying so hard that there were lines in his face that would n't be there again for another thirty years , until effort and disbelief had become familiar to him . " That never happened to me before . He 's hard to figure and hard to know , but we 're friends . Yeah-I 'm teaching him chess . " " I know . You 've done him a lot of good . " " Yes , " Peter said , " I have . " His words acknowledged the fact without falsity or pride . Clara contemplated kissing him and let the mood pass . The fall that year was fine and long with a snapping frost that gave tang to the rose hips . They heard elk trumpeting and had weeks of the rifle-shot impact of the clash of rutting mountain goats . Later there were the real shot sounds of hunters taking to the hills and there was the month-long influx of sportsmen that  | had held the bank , grocery , and dry-goods store together through the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between April snows , in Aureole 's new hospital . Faye Matske would take care of the children while Clara was in school . Andy had gone into an office on the new bank building 's second floor . His survey clients had doubled , and he was n't dependent on the ski area anymore . " I 'm where I always wanted to be , " he said , " my own boss , and getting smarter , and I can still pick mushrooms . " There seemed to be less time for that . The children were growing ; the town was growing , too . In bed in the dark , they talked about their days . They were good days , mostly quiet , mostly peaceful , but they were moving more quickly , picking up speed . The ski area was bringing new wealth to all the valley towns .  | Every spring , Clara had tried for a garden . The growing season was short and the climate so dry that the snows more often evaporated than melted . She had planted patches of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of them died , but she brought the Gold Flume children up on the last day of school every year to see the rue and rosemary , the mint and sorrel , the aloe , clove , and balm . Then there was a two-year drought . At first no one was alarmed . These valleys were accustomed to long dry spells , which were what made the snow so perfect for skiing . In winter  | the snow fell and settled like ash , light as a blind woman 's touch , and the skiers seemed to rest on nothing as they dipped and swooped , their skis making only a whisper in their ears as they went . When the snow melted in spring it carried little water . In those two years the heavier spring snows had n't come and the early summer rains were scant . Everyone saved wash water and bathtub water . People 's treasured lilacs died , and the mountain mahogany and the gray-green scrub oak went to wood and withe in the dust of the summers . The river , slick as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its receding banks , shocking as a nakedness , algae and curds formed like crumbs on the lips of a slattern child . The earth pulled in and went so dry that water poured on it ran away uselessly . Clara 's few remaining herbs dried to paper . She had nothing to show the children that season . In the fall there were now a hundred and fifty students and six grades with six teachers . One Saturday morning a few weeks after Thanksgiving , the house was so noisy that Clara did n't hear the knocking on their door until the visitor began to pound . Andy had been nailing a bracket for wall shelves and Julia was bossily commanding Joseph in some game . When Clara finally heard the visitor and opened the door , the man was almost ready to go away . It was Mr. Barnes , the president of the new parents ' group . " Christmas present , " he said . It was an iron deer , almost life-size . " We got together and got it for you to make up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She put the deer on the east side of the house . Andy said he wanted to shoot the thing out of season . The next year , even though the drought had broken , the parents ' group gave her a birdbath . She liked it and put it where she could watch the sporting birds from the kitchen window . The next year the piece was Snow White and Andy exploded . " It 's awful ! Send it back ! " Clara was pregnant again and tired . 6  | " I ca n't tell the parents their taste is atrocious . The kids love the visits and I 'm able to get some of them to read things they would n't otherwise , because the figures inspire them . " " What happens next year ? Will I feel like I 'm living in an amusement park ? " " You wo n't even see them . I 'll move everything into the blind spot on the northeast side . You 'll never know they 're there . " But the deer , the birdbath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There came a windmill and then a black jockey in iron , which Clara had to fix by painting out the stripes in its clothing and giving it a Union Army uniform . She planted a screen of lilacs between the house and the display , but between snows and in the autumn it was possible to see the growing collection  --  ducks , a sundial , an Indian . The area had the fussy , coy look of a doting grandmother 's mantelpiece . Clara did n't mind , but Andy did , and it became one of the things dragged up in their fights , which always started about something else . At first Andy was alone in this judgment . Julia and Joseph and then their third , Thomas , loved the little figures and the birdbath and took their friends to play there . Julia was a questing , testing little girl , eager , angry , full of suns and storms . Clara , who had been watchful and quiet as a child , did n't understand her daughter 's temperament . Andy , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that had been stifled in himself , and he praised her natural intelligence and even the willfulness that was so much a part of her . " If she does n't get her way , she howls , " Clara complained , " and she is n't a baby anymore . " " She 'll learn to control that on her own , " Andy said , and smiled at his daughter 's excesses . Julia loved her celebrity in town . When she was three and four , she would dimple with pleasure at people 's fussing over her , and the yard ornaments and school visits were evidence of her  | special status in her wide world , which was Gold Flume . At the grocery store there was always an ice-cream cone or a lollipop waiting for her , and when she was eight Pastor Frailey let her work the pedals on the organ and twice let her take the collection . This honor he had allowed no other child . She made the most of it , too , giving sad or baleful looks at nongivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new first grade , she had fully expected her status as Principal 's Oldest Child to be respected by the teachers and other students . She had been the first child in the new school , having visited it in its construction even before the teachers , and she told everyone so on their first day there . " I know it better than anyone except the architect . " She used the term with obvious relish and was disappointed when the teachers did n't allow her to run off and consult her mother at will . As she went into the second and third grades , her natural enjoyment of her status and position became more brittle and tense . She forced things and people , demanding their attention in ways some saw as charming and others as intrusive . Behind her , Joseph toddled , then ran , adoring . He was impish , and while Julia guarded her prerogatives , he cared nothing at all for status and position and won affection without trying for it . Thomas was a quiet , sweet baby , as unlike his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clara had hoped that knowledge of her own family would deepen her insight into the question she asked herself at school : What is the nature of the child ? The issue was only complicated by her new understanding that personality seemed to come already formed , and that she could only channel or try to modify what was already there . In her reading , no definition of children , ape or angel , showed their vast variety of response . Everyone said children reflected what was done or said to them with all the fidelity of a still pond reflecting a summer cloud .  | New teaching methods came . Clara spent parts of summers at courses that explained them , but no one talked about personality or a reconciliation of the old paradox . By the time she was in fourth grade , Julia was a dominant personality at school . Her teachers said she was bossy and made friendships only among the children who would follow her spirited , capricious leadership . Clara waited , yearning for the silent companionship she and Mama used to have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Julia 's confidences about school and friends . Julia 's problems were not what Clara 's had been , but neither were her joys . Clara had never told Mama about being laughed at for her clothes or her smell or her chilblains , but she remembered the delight she had in running home to tell Mama  --  what ? Studies ? Reading ? What had they spoken of so deeply in the sweltering intimacy of the summer kitchen ? Or the icy mornings at the washtub ? Clara knew that Julia was n't having an easy time . People were always reminding her , panderingly or invidiously , of her status as the principal 's child . Clara was proud of Julia 's ability to make friendships of her choice , not to have to live on the edges of other people 's good times as Clara had been forced to do , turning the jump ropes but seldom jumping . Julia could be bright and charming when she wanted to be , and unlike Clara as a child she did n't have to be silent out of shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her children every day , but Julia showed none of the eager joy for words that Clara remembered from her own childhood . The difference puzzled Clara and saddened her . When Peter Tavistock was in his sophomore year of high school he had begun to visit Clara at home . He gave the excuse of needing help at school but actually he was yearning for someone to talk to , to wrangle with in the wide range of his interests , few of which were discussed in his classes . He had a strong intellectual curiosity and an original cast of mind that delighted Clara .  | As he opened to the human factors in his reading he became more interested in the language of the political movements he studied . He made Clara ransack her memory for the words union organizers and company mine owners had used during her childhood . How did they define themselves ? Were the prospectors different from the company miners ? How did they describe themselves ? He took a trip to Ludlow and studied grave sites at Telluride and Central City . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Bluebank had been settled by claim-jumpers , independent prospectors , and bootleg miners whose midnight holes weakened the horizontal shafts of company mines . In his third year of high school , Peter began to be interested in war . He hated its violence and death , its destruction of carefully made moralities , but he was fascinated by the phenomenon . Did war have a special language ? Did it promote special ideas ? If the South had won , how would our speech be different ? When he asked his high school history teacher , she told him such speculations were fruitless , and he came fuming up the Jackass Pass road to Clara , full of righteous anger . By that time , his sister , Lucinda , was in high school , too , but she was deep into her artistic interests and too appalled by the very idea of war to talk about it . Peter began to study tactics and strategy , particularly of the conflict in Korea . Germany had won the First World War on Percivals ' living room floor , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tried to postulate the world that would have resulted . Clara missed those afternoons when he graduated and went away to college . He said he would write , but she did n't think he would . By then , many of her first students had faded from Clara 's world . Sulo Boda , then his brother Cyril , had disappeared to the gulch ranch . Some families had moved ; Old Man Markham , about whom Clara had written for advice , died and two of his maimed daughters drifted away . Frances Legrand stayed married  | to Buster French and had four more children . She and Buster moved , temporarily , they said , then permanently , into the French compound . Buster joined his brothers and uncles at the sad bottom of Gold Flume 's social order : jail , sporadic work , blame , neglect , violence , and forgetting . The men haunted two of the town 's six saloons , the women sent their children to the grocery store to keep from going to town themselves . By the time her first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the girl she had been . She was now a slack-jawed , collapsed woman , the eagerness Clara had once seen in her soured into hate . The refinery builders had moved on , but the engineers stayed , and with the ski area increasing , there were lodge owners and ski area technicians , a doctor , lawyer , and dentist in Gold Flume itself , and the people who operated the new motels and restaurants . These people moved into the new development on the far side of town and Clara continued her school visits there . Some of the houses were well furnished , some almost empty , the families living in wealthy surroundings and sleeping in bedrolls on the bare floor . It was a new kind of poverty to Clara . She had never imagined a poverty that hid itself , secret want in a fine house . " Wait until Peter comes home for the summer , " she told Andy . " He 'll be interested in studying this . He knows Cyril Boda and other Gulch people , but this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's a secrecy the ordinary kind of poverty does n't have , " Clara wrote to Peter , " a secrecy that makes everyone else , even the well-disposed , potential enemies . " Peter surprised Clara by answering her letters with full and eager descriptions of his new world  --  Negroes , Mexicans , Jews , open homosexuals ? " It 's like color when you 've only seen black-and-white movies  --  their lives are nothing like mine , their world nothing like Gold Flume . " Clara wrote back , " Do n't forget that while your new culture has a wide spread , ours has a deep one . We live with social dif-  | ferences that city people rarely do . How many bank presidents in city communities know their letter carriers and children 's teachers socially and see them in other contexts than at work ? The problems of social distance are increasing for us , also . " Now there were Bodas , Frenches , and also the new doctor , the lawyer , the dentist . The Ditmarses and the Bogards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new wealth of the town . Because of this separation , Clara asked the parents ' group to hold school events , a barbecue in summer and a sleigh ride in winter , to help people come together informally . When Joseph started school , his teachers threw up their hands at his antics and fell in love with him . He was freckled and redheaded like his father , and Clara was glad of an orthodontist in Aureole who might help him later with his teeth . Thomas was dark like Clara , even darker than Julia , but from the beginning , nothing could overwhelm Andy 's partiality to his daughter . " You ca n't criticize Joey for what he does , when it 's the same thing you praised Julia for doing , " Clara argued . She argued in vain . Andy dismissed Julia 's tempers and imperiousness , was kind and patient with Thomas , but Joey , full of joyous spirit , drew no praise or approval from him . Clara wondered why this was until she happened to see Joey standing with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiant , we-twotogether smile that was Arlo 's trademark and Joey 's curse , shutting him away from Andy 's trust and , therefore , from his love . Peter Tavistock began to question staying in college . He had a deferment from military service , but he thought about going into the army . The Korean War was over . Peace talks were under way in Panmunjom . He wrote , " I 'm going to be a historian . This is my chance to see what history really feels like , smells and tastes like . If only I can get over there ! " He was soon writing to Clara from basic training . He asked for books , and these she sent , along with cookies she baked for him .  | She looked forward to his letters because the voice in them was so clearly Peter 's own . Great questions were bracketed with petty annoyances . He had witty and penetrating descriptions of army life and the places of his training . When his request for Korean posting was approved , he sent her his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the peace talks , guarding the U.S. delegation but also interrupting at key moments with the crucial word here , the necessary guidance there . Once in Korea he sent fascinating descriptions of the country and its people , of villages at the perimeter , of Tokyo and Seoul and the devastation of the war , which his reading and study had never made real to him . " I want to see history clearly , to think about it while it 's still news , while I 'm experiencing it , so that thirty years from now , standing in my mothball-fumy uniform on Veterans Day , I 'll be able to see the difference between what I knew and what history has agreed to have happened . " Clara sent him clippings and articles about Korea and wrote some of her experiences in the changing town . A mother came to my office yesterday . She was furious about a book in the school library , a love story written for teenagers . The characters in it meet secretly , kiss and do a bit of petting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They break up . The mother said it was obscene and demanded I take it off the shelves . " Books are supposed to ennoble people , " she said . She told me the school was supposed to ennoble children the way church does . I told her that in some ways I agreed . I had been " ennobled " by books and reading , I hoped , but there were other things education should provide and one of them was a recognizable presentation of the world . I think you and I have talked about this now and again . Is childhood a training time for life , or years through which some inborn holiness and innocence are to be prolonged ? When I asked her that , she only stared at me and  | demanded I take the book away . Please include this paradox in the history you write . I want pages 365 and 366 in Tavistock 's American History 1929 ? 1979 to deal with it . You may use my name in the footnote or not as you see fit . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Details to follow . The spring was mild that year . The school windows , those that could be opened , received the fluttering of a May wind that reminded Clara of the milder springs down mountain in San Pablo and Pueblo . Because of that , she had evocations of those days , of a younger , more restless self . Lena Sanchez had smelled this fragrance on the wind and wondered about the war and what was to become of her . Clara sometimes remembered with amazement that she had been such a person and had done such things . The children Clara Percival wrote to in San Pablo were now young adults . It was a spring day that smelled just like this when they had stood by Arlo 's hospital bed .. . " Clara ? " It was Alice Bogard , putting her head around the doorway into the office . " Alice  --  Oh , Lord , I was back years ago in another body . Are you down shopping ? " Alice did n't answer . Her pleasant , freckled face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voice , and I want to sit here while you read it . " Clara knew from Alice 's look and manner that the news was bad . She began to play for time . " I never get to this until the weekend . " " I know that , " Alice said gently . " It 's why I brought it . " " I remember when it was a two-pager , " Clara murmured , and started looking down the front page . Let it be this ? " Oh , this , yes .... " It was news of the new development , roads already begun across the Jackass Pass road from the Percivals ' house . " Rename the road ? Good Lord , is n't Jackass Pass Road good enough for them ? "  | " Turn the page , " Alice said , and her voice , toneless and flat , brought Clara 's head up . " Alice ? " " I do n't know any other way to tell you about this ? " Clara turned the page : KOREAN CONFLICT CLAIMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tavistock of Gold Flume .. . " But the war is over ! " Clara protested . Alice did n't answer . Clara tried to read the article that followed . Peter had gotten transferred to a unit guarding the DMZ . Occasionally patrols traded fire by mistake or got lost in storms or fogs and wandered out of their limits . Peter had been with his unit on such a patrol , and they had encountered Korean troops and he and two other soldiers had been shot . The two were injured , one seriously . Peter had been killed . An investigation would be made into the details . Families had been notified .... " The words are not letting me get away , " Clara said . " I ca n't stop this from being true , can I ? " Alice shook her head and they sat together in silence for a long time . " He was on his way to another future , " Clara said to Andy that night . " That 's what I ca n't let go of . Kester French built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a stopover , a digression ? " " He was a likable kid , " Andy said . " I remember him up here banging the table over the Battle of the Marne . I do n't think most people knew how bright he was . It 's a damn shame . " Clara did n't start crying until she had her hands in dishwater . It was Mama 's old mess , weeping into the suds , having to dry her hands before she could blow her running nose .  | That evening , she read Peter 's letters again . She had kept them in a shoebox on her history shelf . There were about thirty letters and they covered a three-year period , college , military training , then Korea . Reading them in order , Clara saw into a depth she had not penetrated before . Peter had grown and changed in those three years , but not steadily or evenly like a dawn breaking . His growth had been in strands , themes , like a creek finding a new bed , then filling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read , thought , explored , he changed the outlines he had previously made , widening some , rounding others . His experiences had been working on him , but he had n't been passive under them . He had been working on himself all the while , trying to shape what he was living into a coherent system , philosophy , belief . It had been a conscious effort . To do this work , he had had to trim , to change , to invent and mold  --  Clara wondered if this was her model of the child , born neither ape nor angel , and not passive but busily working at experience to organize it , to give it meaning , good or bad . Whatever deeper thoughts Peter 's letters inspired , they were full of his sense of discovery . It occurred to Clara that whatever Peter had been writing to his parents or to Lucinda , these letters would be different and it might mean a lot to the family to read them . Clara called the Ute River Voice the next day and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visit had been made four days ago . Clara thought it over . She had been Peter 's friend , and though she and his mother were n't speaking and only nodded coolly to each other as they passed their shopping carts at the market , she knew she should pay her condolence visit and let the family read the letters .  | She waited until Saturday , made the chicken casserole she usually brought to such occasions , put the letters in a nicer box , and drove down to the Tavistocks ' old mausoleum of a house . Because the house was past the far end of town , Clara had n't come that way since she had walked Peter home almost seven years before . In summer , the place had been screened by hedges and foliage , only its third floor showing . Now it stood stripped of its protection . She stopped at the end of the buckled street and saw that the entire eastern hillside that bounded the house lot had been staked out for the new high-  | way that was to link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east side of the house would look out on that highway , separated only by a stream and a swath of scrub . The house would be forty feet from the passing cars and trucks , fully visible to them , and because it was set low , no fence or shrubbery could mask or protect it . Loaded semis and trailers would labor up the grade , making all the urgent sounds of their gear changes . There would be road litter , papers and worse thrown and blown down into the Tavistocks ' careful yard . It was a modern punishment for house-hubris , a tear in the illusion of mastery and safety . Clara parked the car in sight of the house but not in front of it . Dorothy Tavistock did n't belong to the sewing group or the altar society or any of the other gatherings of Town women , but Clara had half expected some sign of visitors with their loaves of bread , apple spice cakes , casseroles . There was no sign . The house was as daunting and unwelcoming as she remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Clara pushed the shrieking gate open and went up the walk to the door . She knocked , then waited . Just as she was considering knocking again , Lucinda opened the door a little way . Lucinda had changed in the five years since leaving Gold Flume School , more than a physical change . Her shyness had been transmuted into reticence , her stiffness into dignity . Clara held out the casserole and box of letters and said , " Lucinda , I 'm so sorry about Peter . " Lucinda nodded but said nothing . Her eyes had dissolved in tears . Behind Lucinda in the parlor , Clara could hear the soft sibilances and rise and fall of subdued talk . People had come . " Visitors ? " " Relations from back east . " Lucinda made a gesture of vague dislike . " I 'll just leave these ? " Clara said , and began to step inside .  | At that moment , Dorothy Tavistock 's grieved voice came raised from the other room . " Who is that ? " Lucinda turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one from town had come , except , perhaps , the pastor . Dorothy Tavistock felt that no one in Gold Flume was her social equal , so Clara 's affection for Peter would n't be seen as honoring him . She stood uncertainly at the door and then Dorothy was there . " So it 's you , " she said . Her eyes had been emptied with weeping , but hate moved across them like a darkness . Clara stood clumsily , hands full . She had expected hesitation from Dorothy , even annoyance , but not the hate she saw . " I have letters , " she said in explanation . " I 'm sure you do . I have letters also . He compared me to you in his letters . He told me to get to know you , to learn from you , to be more like you . Why did you alienate my son 's affections ? You had no purpose with him after he finished as your student . " Clara stood , thinking she had no answer the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I told you to leave him alone . I told you once to leave him alone ! " The stridency of her tone brought three of the relatives out into the hall where she stood , and the hired woman came from the kitchen . With embarrassment 's uneven perception , Clara noticed that it was n't Ella Matske . Clara was still standing on her side of the threshold and she knew now that she would bring no healing or reconciliation with anything she did , so she turned and left , Dorothy Tavistock 's voice rising behind her in mounting shrill accusation . Its noise drowned out the cry of the gate and then the sounds stopped . " Wait ! " Lucinda came running from the back of the house . " Wait , please . " " I ca n't , " Clara said . " Just let me go now . " Lucinda put out an arm . " I 'm suffering , too , " she said .  | Clara stopped and looked at her . " What can I do  --  it only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car and held the door while Clara put the casserole and letters on the floor in the back . Then Clara got in and leaned over to open the door for Lucinda . The smell of the still-warm food rose in the closed space . " Chicken and noodles ? " Lucinda asked . " Yes . " They laughed , and then Clara found herself in tears . " Oh , God , I 'll miss Peter ! He had such great capacity , and how much I wanted to talk to him about everything  --  his experiences , his hopes . I had a lifetime of talk stored up , waiting ... " Lucinda motioned toward the house . " He was their great hope . I do n't know what they will do . " The two of them were quiet for a while , and then Clara asked Lucinda how she had been . " Are you still drawing ? " " Less than I was . I 've gotten interested in three-dimensional forms  --  I 've started sculpting . " They talked about Lucinda 's plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a good deal of the girl Clara had known in school , warming , in the presence of interest , into eagerness . She was n't a pretty girl , but enthusiasm made her beautiful . They were enjoying the conversation when they suddenly became aware of the time passing . Parents and relatives were waiting . Clara said , " I had all those letters from Peter that I thought your mother would want to see ? " " She would n't , but I would . " Lucinda gestured to the box . " I 'll see you get them back . " As they said good-bye , the door of the Tavistock house opened and Dorothy stepped out onto the porch and began to look up and down the street . She saw the car and Lucinda closing the door . Her eye caught her daughter and the box of letters and she turned a stare of hate on Clara that was as unequivocal as a blow .  | When Clara told Andy about the visit he said , " You 're a full citizen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , and you 've even got an enemy . Treat her well . With care , she could last a lifetime . " Peter 's body came back to Gold Flume for burial . The pastor thought the town should have a memorial service or a graveside ceremony , but the family refused . The house , weathering and raw , exposed to the new highway , drew in on itself . Lucinda graduated and stayed away . Two years later , Clara got a package and a letter from Chama , New Mexico . Lucinda wrote that she was working as a school janitor and doing art in her spare hours . In the package was a small , detailed sculpture . Of the three female figures , two stood close and turned toward each other . The largest was facing away from them , her arms thrown wide , her face turned up , distorted with anguish . She was a big woman , but her gestures had something of constriction in them . The second figure stood in an attitude of dejection , hands covering her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstracted as she was grieved . The sculpture was in bronze , and untitled . When Clara showed it to the teachers , one of them saw it as a Three Marys . It was an honest Three Marys , she said , , each sorrowing in her own way , the three united in their grief but in nothing else . The sculpture was small , no more than eight inches high and six long . " I think it 's a war story , " Clara said , but would say no more .  | Julia went into the new junior high that had just been opened in Callan and Clara felt lightened by her leaving . She confided that to no one but Alice Bogard . " We argued all the time . I hate cliques and work against them . They give most of the pain that 's suffered in school , but Julia was always angry at me for backing the teachers who separated her from her friends . Maybe she wo n't bring these fights home anymore . " " Are you still hoping you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother were ? " " I know it 's a dream , but I still dream it , that we 'll be working away together , talking woman talk . Where would that happen ? I  | do n't know . She thinks I 'm cold and forbidding , but I get along well with your girls and with Katy 's , too . " Alice said quietly , " You and Julia are so different , I wonder if you see the same daisy or smell the same rose . I see you together , rankling each other without even trying . The very things you want her to do and be oppress her , and she , poor soul , comes to you offering all the wrong things . " Julia had dozens of acquaintances in junior high . Clara saw a kaleidoscope of faces and bodies running in and out of the house , playing records or trying on one another 's clothes , this girl , that girl , in favor and out before Clara could learn their names . They would be in Julia 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all swoop away somewhere else , and the next week a new group , and any girl Clara remembered disdained and forgotten : " Oh , her ! " and the look of exasperation . When Clara complained , Andy shrugged . " What do you expect ? " " I do n't know , " Clara would answer , " maybe that she keep one or two special girls to be her friends , her confidantes . She 's too willful , too mercurial ? " And Andy would shrug again and shake his head . Joey grew to look more and more as his father must have looked at that age , all pratfalls , hands , legs , elbows , but the smile and the gift to befriend was pure Arlo Percival , and Andy would glower as he watched his son laugh his openhearted laugh . He saw no pleasure , but only a con man judging his mark . Arlo had been gone so long , Clara wondered if Andy would remember what he looked like if not for Joey and his smile . Oliver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiking . " Why does Andy come down so hard on him ? " Katy asked . " Because he smiles like Arlo , " was all that Clara could say . Clara loved Joey headlong . She loved his generosity , his joyousness , his easy laughter , and easy sorrow . He had a delight in adventure that was n't mean or vindictive , only fun-loving , and  | Clara watched Andy 's jaw tighten and his eyes go hard when he heard his son 's laughter or saw that incandescent smile . Sometimes they argued . Andy forgave Julia her imperious will and was enchanted by her quickness . When she had fights at school he took her side , listening sympathetically to her accusations of this or that girl who was making trouble for her . Now and then mothers would call about the cruelty of the cliques or malicious words or about how Julia 's supposedly best friends had come home crying . When Clara tried to show her daughter how her attitudes were hurting others , the denials were shot back out of Julia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the one who ... " and it was her sureness and will that kept her at the center of all the junior high intrigues , the groupings and regroupings of those years . Andy admired it , Andy praised it . The teachers said Julia was coasting through school on her intelligence alone , doing minimal work . When Andy heard this he would say that the school was limiting . When Joey was ten , he discovered the practical joke . Clara and Andy endured whatever popped out at them or fell down on them , learned to live with rubber turds , plastic ink stains , plagues of rubber beetles , flies , worms , and roaches , lifelike vomit and broken eggs . Coronets of plastic flies decorated every potato salad . Thomas followed his brother like an awed dog . One August afternoon the summer herb tour was being held in the yard . The children and some parents were walking among the yard figures . There were twelve now , including windmills and a sundial , and all of a sudden there was water everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the drenching . Joey had gotten someone 's old hose , punctured it with holes , and run a series of small tubes through the holes . There was more to it , some kind of pressure-builder , and it all showed considerable study and application . Clara was surprised to see Andy , pushed well beyond annoyance , spank Joey hard . " Your father is a good  | man , " she told Joey afterward , " he 's honest and generous , and lie 's usually even-tempered , but do n't shame him in public , because he ca n't take that . " He gave her his level look and said , " It 's not fair . " " It 's how he is . " " It was a good trick , though ; it really worked . " " I suppose it was , but maybe some people had clothes ruined , and it certainly put an end to herb study for the day . " She saw him taking that in , absorbing it . " They 're pranks and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andy , who was still seething . " They were n't done as insults to you . " " I do n't care . I wo n't be pointed at in public , " he said , " and especially not by him . " " Oh , Lord , " Clara murmured to herself , " whoever thinks children cement the bonds of marriage has bedfeathers in his hair ! " That fall , on a November Sunday when hunting season 's iridescent blue sky made going to church an act of consummate piety , Clara and Andy sat together in their pew and listened to the sounds of gunshots echoing through the hills . Julia and Thomas were sitting with their friends . Joseph was home sick . Just as the service was ending they heard a deafening fusillade of gunshots outside the church , followed immediately by the sound of shattering glass . Everyone rushed out the door . In the parking lot , shotgun blasts had destroyed the windows of every car . People went back to see and stopped , stunned , gaping at it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began calling out to the others , " It 's a trick .... It 's . . . they 're decals ! " People poured into the lot , even those who had come on foot , and they saw that every car had a broken-glass or a bullet-hole decal of clear plastic . Shock and rage were followed by relief and laughter , then by wonder . There were thirty-four cars in the lot .  | There must have been many pranksters in on the trick , which had taken organization , speed , and silence . They had done the decaling while people were in church , then they had shot the guns , dropping thirty pounds or so of metal sheeting and iron chain that everyone had heard as crazing and shattering glass . Unsmiling , Andy stood with Clara by their own bullet-riddled window . " That boy had better be home . If he did n't do this , he masterminded it . " Joey was in bed when they got home . Andy was furious , but fear of confronting his son in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look at Joey darkly . Three days later , the story began to emerge . It was impossible for five boys to keep one secret ; one of them bragged . Clara had known where Joey had been all along . She had opened her son 's closet when Andy had left the room and received a strong whiff of cordite from the clothing there . When Andy did find out that the plan had been Joey 's , organized and executed by him , he went white with rage . " Be annoyed , " Clara said , " but this is n't grand larceny . " " The boy 's spirited , " Oliver declared when he heard about it . " There 's not a malicious thought in his head . " He told the story around the county shops and for years afterward would laugh at the memory of the prank . Andy would n't hear his brother-in-law 's defense of Joey and kept watching his son for evidence of criminality . Thomas measured his sister 's willfulness and his brother 's spiritedness and he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hid . He became quieter , more deliberate . He was the gentlest of their children , one who could be brought to tears by a tragedy on the evening news . This gentleness also he pulled inward . Clara thought that if there were differences between her family and others , the Bogards or the Bordereaus , one difference might be that the Percivals did n't reminisce about their childhood days . Clara told the children about Mama , her love of color and music , her dancing , her luxuriant auburn hair . She  | mentioned that Winston Coleman had come from Virginia and that the sideboard at home and the silver service at Uncle Oliver and Aunt Katy 's had come from his people . That was all , or almost all . Andy went vague when the boys asked questions or friends talked about their childhood days . In the winter of that year , two pieces of mail addressed to Clara came a month apart . They were postcards sent in envelopes . The cards and postmarks were from different places . Daughter , Hoping this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as next of kin . I 'm in a situation here . If someone calls about me , tell him you have all the necessary evidence in a safety-deposit box . A. Percival The postcard was from Schroon Lake , New York . The postmark from Winston-Salem , North Carolina . The second said : Daughter , Can you send forty ? Need is great . It pays to get arrested in the morning as lunch is pokey 's main meal . General Delivery , Fargo , North Dakota . Clara sent a money order with a note : " Dear Arlo , It 's worth the forty to know you are still alive . " She did n't tell Andy . In the spring of Julia 's first year of high school , Clara became a public figure . She was chosen Colorado Elementary Educator of the Year , and a long article in the Ute River Voice proclaimed : EXCELLENCE IN GOLD FLUME . The article profiled her career in the valley and quoted statistics that were surprising even to Clara . More Gold Flume students did well in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the county , more went on to college . Many credited their love of poetry and literature to her  | special reading programs , poetry collections , Richest Student contest , and poem duels . Clara and Andy were given a three-day trip to Denver and introduced to the governor , and Clara spoke at a national convention of elementary school principals , receiving mention in the Rocky Mountain News and the Denver Post . The articles were full of overpraise and inaccuracy . Her speech at the convention was received with the politeness reserved for the utterly irrelevant . As a grade school principal in a rural county , she still had control over much of the school 's day , as did the individual teachers . The teachers at the convention were wrestling with racial balances . Clara had no such problem . The principals were worried about interracial fighting , local control , government fiat . Clara 's problem was the harmonizing of widening social classes . At the social hours they ignored her or studied her as one would study a specimen from Civil War days kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clara and Andy got back from Denver , there was a party at the school and Clara was presented with the articles from the Denver and Gold Flume papers all nicely framed . She had to hang them in her office and pretend to be pleased . She wished the articles were about the school itself . Then she could have hung them in the hall for the students to read and enjoy . " Are n't you pleased ? " Alice asked . Clara shrugged . " It 's nice to be praised , but not for the wrong reasons . I got tired of smiling and pretending . My reality was irrelevant there . " " What do you mean ? " " Gold Flume School sends kids to the junior high well prepared , but the trip that was supposed to have been a reward made me sad , and now I feel more isolated than ever . " That summer Clara took more classes at the University of Colorado , commuting home on weekends . History and geography had disappeared into social studies and were leached of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elementary school  | readers had been purged into two-syllable simplicity . She came back puzzled , meditative , and quiet . The school year began , and there were two new teachers to convince . " Read the books to them . Read what you like yourself and do n't worry about the vocabulary . Read them Dickens and Francis Parkman . " They stared at her . The development across the road was now ready for occupancy , and people began to move into the houses before they were fully finished . At night the place glowed with lights that dimmed the stars . Jackass Pass Road had been renamed Flume Heights Road , the development was called Flume Heights . When she could , Clara still walked home from school on the trail she had made herself , still experiencing the seasonal changes of light and dark , flowering , greening , and decline . On this November day , imminent snow had brought them to full darkness and Clara had come as usual , carrying her flashlight but not using it , up the trail from the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Andy was home , his car parked in the lean-to west of the house . She went around to the back door because of the mud on her boots . Letting herself in quietly , she heard Andy 's voice in a low murmur . He must be reading to the kids . She came very quietly through the kitchen , thinking to enjoy the scene and not interrupt . " Please remember , " he was saying , " that we have a special position here in town . Because of your mother 's work , people 's eyes are on us . " What was this ? She went close and peeked through the hinge side of the half open door . They were sitting in the little TV room that Andy and Oliver had added on to the house . Julia , Joseph , and Thomas were sitting close together , and they looked small and a little cowed . Usually they fought for space , spreading themselves wide and complaining if anyone 's body or clothing touched them . " That 's not fair ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julia used that most annoyed her mother , a whining , petulant , and bossy sound .  | " I know it is n't fair , " Andy said , " but it 's the way things are . Like it or not , you need to be more careful than other kids about what you say and do . " She wanted to go in and stop him . What he said was true , but she did n't want them to feel the town 's judgment weighing down their days and squeezing the joy out of them . The Percival children were judged more narrowly than other children ; they were both more and less privileged , but Clara had wanted them not to be so blatantly aware of it . Julia made a face . " I 'm not a kid anymore . " Andy nodded . " That 's why I 'm telling you this . It 's not fair to have a special set of rules to live under , but your mother 's position demands it , and you 're going to have to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop enjoying yourselves or struggle to please everyone . I 'm asking you to be conscious of your behavior and consider your actions a little more .... " She backed away from the door and heard Julia 's voice , with its whine of discontent ; Joey 's voice , trying to sound helpful ; and Thomas 's voice , the sound of a child who only thought he had done wrong in some way . Andy 's remarks had saddened her . Their position in town had come to mean so much to him that he must be seeing each member of his family as a potential hostage to it and still thinking of his own father as a wild card that could fall face up before the world at any time . And nothing changed . Julia , who had felt hemmed in by the time she was in junior high , added unwilling martyrdom to her other defenses , blamed Clara , and hated Gold Flume even more . Joseph tried restraint but was as incapable of it as a happy drunk at a party . Thomas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bore the lesson longest and became even more silent and introspective than he had been before . Clara never told Andy she had come in on his talk , but in small ways she tried to whisper to the children over his head , " You can laugh a little , you can shine a little .... "  | It seemed that no sooner had they built the new school than temporary buildings had to be added . The towns were booming , the ski area was growing ; two blocks of shops had gone up on the north and south sides of the railroad tracks and the old depot was remodeled for a restaurant . Gold Flume School 's enrollment doubled again . Enrichment programs had come into the county curriculinn , and the school got a film projector and a library of educational films . Clara felt like a pirate in a movie , sifting treasure in the chests of the hoard , but when the teachers tested the children at the end of the year , everyone was shocked at how little the students had learned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no connection between them and their other studies . The television news was showing images of the civil rights struggle going on in the big cities . Clara had speakers come to the school to talk about the problems that were light-years from the valley towns but a nightly event on the news . Many of the parents were critical of her , and some protested strongly . There were no Negroes or Mexicans in Gold Flume , they said , and the children were having nightmares . " It 's as much a class struggle as a racial one , " Clara explained to the parents ' group , " and we 're near enough to that right here . " She told them about the five girls , fourth-graders she had come upon standing in a ring around a sixth . " She called us a name ! " they screamed . The girl in the middle of the ring was Rio Markham , born to the youngest Markham girl , probably by her father . They lived in the old cabin on Chinaman 's Creek and Rio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition of the term . " Rio ... " The girl was mealy pale under her freckles . Her hair , braided tightly into two stiff ropes , seemed to pull her face even tighter . " She had that party  --  she would n't let me come . I asked her why not , when the whole class came , and she said  --  they said  --  I was a nigger . I only called them nigger back . " Clara had to decide whether she should start with the word nigger first or with what was behind it . Everyone had heard about the ski party . " Everybody got invitations but me , " Rio murmured . Clara was proud of Rio , standing her ground . Her sense of what was fair had overwhelmed her Gulch child 's shame . All the new children had skis and lift passes they traded back and forth , but the Gulch children and the Ranch children and the poorer Town children were n't part of those enviable networks . " Well ? " Clara turned to the party-giver . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't have come anyway . Those kids who live " ? and she waved a vague  | hand southward to where the ranches and the gulches lay ? " up there ... " " I know where Rio lives , " Clara said coolly . " I was born and raised near the top of Placer Gulch . " Rio 's face showed amazement . Clara let her steady gaze convince the girl . Then she turned to the party-giver . " I think Rio deserves a big apology from all of you , even those who did n't say anything but did n't protest . " They were all wide-eyed innocence . There was an apology at last , but Clara did n't know if what she had said sank into anyone 's consciousness or was only to be forgotten , the authority placated . The parents heard her story with equanimity , and some of them began to excuse the girls ' behavior . Only a few looked down or shook their heads in disapproval . Clara said quietly , " We ca n't have that divisiveness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a film about prejudice was offered , she sent for it and showed it to the school . Stealing at school began to increase . Some of the teachers dealt with it case by case , and some not at all , but when complaints began to come from all the classes , Clara raised it in a teachers ' meeting . " What 's changed here ? " " It 's the degree , " one teacher said . " The wealthy and the poor do n't share much experience any-more , " another said . " The children of the highway workers do n't care what they do . They 're like the refinery kids , here and gone . " " Everyone steals ; it 's natural at that age . " " The rich ones come in with lots of fancy things , showing off . Who can blame the poorer ones ? " " But the poor kids are n't the only ones doing it , " Clara said , " and the poor children of twenty years ago were poorer than i hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had thought that when everyone had inside water and plumbing , the ridicule and envy would stop . " We need to take a stand . "  | She canceled a day 's classes and had a full assembly . The sheriff came and read the law to them ; Pastor Frailey spoke . One or two children volunteered their experiences with stealing and spoke of the lasting shame they felt . Some of the parents were outraged , and Clara had to defend her idea . " Children should n't be coming to school with valuable things and showing off , but a child should be able to wear the crown jewels to school without fear that they 'll be stolen . " Some parents expressed approval , but it was given in private ; at the school meeting , many people said the matter should have been handled more discreetly . " Theft is n't merely a social blunder , " Clara argued , wondering why so many of the parents took it so lightly . By then , Julia was in her last year of high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had achieved short , intense rapprochements . There was a failed prom in her sophomore year from which she came home weeping into Clara 's comforting embrace . There was a play in which Julia starred that took careful study , and Clara coached her , sewed for her , praised her . But Clara felt that most of the time her daughter had set her up as a judge  --  an image shaking her head in disapproval in spite of all the reality she tried to heap against it . Julia was home less and less , being whirled away more often in the complex choreography of high school social life . Clara admitted guiltily to Alice and defensively to Katy that her daugh-ter 's absence was a relief . Julia 's overlarge presence in the family scarcely left breathing room for Joseph and Thomas . Now that she was often busy with after-school activities or staying at friends ' houses or with Oliver and Katy , Clara was free to discover Joey 's spirit and Thomas 's subtle sense of humor , the outcome of all his years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alice said . " They make claim to it earlier than we did . "  | " Our world was poorer , " Katy said . " We stayed together because we were scared and poor and desperate and most of the world outside was against us . We clung . " " Katy , I 've been asking Julia what she wants to do with her life  --  she 's almost eighteen and she does n't seem to know . " Katy smiled . " Most people are n't like you , Clar . You knew from the start you wanted to be a teacher . Most of us blunder around until we get interested in something or get tired of looking . " " What do you think of that ? " Clara asked Alice . Her friend grinned . " Katy 's right , you know . " She looked levelly at Clara . " You 'd die if she did n't go to college , would n't you ? " " Yes . " " Because you had to fight so hard . " Clara nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How could that be ? She 's bright  --  she needs a wider world . " " But college will be different for her . You discovered it , claimed it for yourself . These kids we raise so carefully do n't have the chance to discover much on their own . We give it all from the beginning . I know I did that . College . Martha dropped out to get married . Sarah never had the joy you told me about when you left the Prillers , that scary , eager trip to San Pablo , the discovering , the claiming ... " But Clara could n't relinquish the dream . Julia might have no direction , she argued , but college would . give her one . There , with freedom , choice would form into vocation . In spite of what everyone said , Clara could n't believe that people were n't signaled , called by voices meant only for themselves . It had happened to her . Perhaps it did n't come at such an early age to everyone . Perhaps people stifled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a call sent , how did people know where to aim their lives ? Julia took Clara 's urgings and gave her passive , shrugged ; acquiescence . She would go . For the first time Andy heard  | her with misgiving , then with impatience . " Is she doing us a favor ? " They sent for catalogs , wrote letters , marveled over the profusion of classes and courses . Julia said no to this , to that , and finally yes to the University of Colorado . When Andy and Clara added up all the costs , they nearly lost their courage . " Be sure , " they said , and took Julia to visit the school . It was huge . There were more people on the campus than were in the five towns of the Ute Valley added together . Would she be lost there ? But when Julia was accepted , she seemed pleased . She called all her friends and talked for hours about it . Two days after her acceptance , Andy came back from a trip to Aureole with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the makings of a picnic , an echo of his surprise banquet in Golden twenty years before . " All of us this time , " he said , but the boys had made other plans , and at the last minute , Julia also begged off . Clara was disappointed , but on the way up Jackass Pass she decided their being alone was a blessing . It was a glowing afternoon , August turning mellow in the high country where the wild maple , last to bud and first to yellow , was lighting its fires . They went up the pass to the second hairpin and struck up-country to a little grove that Andy knew . It had been years since they had been there . " I did n't know the way was so steep , " Clara said , " or the basket so heavy . " They moved slowly , not feeling older but tiring sooner . When they found the grove , they saw the place was littered with the papers and bottles of careless campers but not having the energy to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess , more disappointed than they would let each other know . " Never mind , we ca n't see that well anymore . " " Speak for yourself . Age can not wither ... ' " " Then something else has . Fifteen years ago we would have made love in this grove . Now it 's just champagne and an ache of bunions. "  | They spread the picnic , murmuring back and forth , in the comfortable code of the long married . Then Clara said , " I have a confession to make . " " Confess away . " " I once sent money to Arlo . " " Only once ? I thought it was more . " " How did you know ? " " My dear girl , if you 're going to lie and cheat , you 'll have to learn some guile . You sent a money order and you sent it registered . I saw the return slip in the mail and the old con man 's signature on it large as life . Forty bucks  --  you got off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Look out over those mountains and tell me how important it is after all . " They opened the champagne and toasted their accomplishment . Alone , they were free to brag , exult , and make declarations their children would have been embarrassed to hear . The clay stretched itself out , dozing and easy , and it seemed at that height that their inward vision reached as far as the sight of their eyes , hill after hill , mountain after mountain , sufficient to itself , full of repose in the golden light . The next week was all hurry and shopping , packing , sulks and good-byes , and taking Julia to Boulder to her first year at a university where her call would come and her way be made plain .  | They were soon aware of Julia 's unhappiness . Six times that first semester she called them , telling them her classes were vast and the lectures were to hundreds over a PA system . They counseled patience . After the required classes were out of the way , the numbers would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she might transfer to a smaller school . But when she came home for Christmas , Julia said she had joined some clubs and was finding her way in spite of the impersonality of the school . Clara tried to talk to her . What was shc ' reading ? Was she wrestling with paradox in her studies , questing  | as Peter had , puzzled as she herself had been ? Had new interests come ? What was her social world like , her friends , her roommate ? Julia would say she was too tired to talk , or it was too late , or she was expected somewhere with friends . " It 's all boring , any-way , " and she would shrug . When she went back after the vacation , she wrote that she had decided to continue at the university through the spring term . When the term ended they thought she would find summer work in the valley . Clara was taking on bookkeeping work to help pay the tuition . Joseph would soon be in college , too , and needing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has begun to extend into the summer . Hotels and motels are staying open , and some feature rafting and pack trips up the gulches . What about a job ? Julia called . " I 'm going to stay here over the summer . There 's work and I can take a class and be that much ahead . I 'll need more money , though . " Puzzled , Clara asked , " What class would you take ? What 's the rush ? " Julia sounded vague . " Political action teach-ins . " " I do n't understand it , " Clara said to Alice . " She was never interested in politics . I wonder if she has n't found a boy . " Alice was resting a backache against the sun-warm wood of her corral fence . She laughed . " Maybe it is a boy , maybe a cause . Our kids tried all kinds of things in college , the two who went . They joined all kinds of groups . Rob was a socialist , did you know that ? " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds so far away . She seems to be saying that whatever her interests are , I could n't understand them . "  | Alice looked out into the deep summer blue of the sky . " Carl 's gone up with the herd to summer pasture and I 'll be alone this week , " she said . " Why not stay overnight , and we 'll make marshmallows and talk . " " Slumber party ? " " Yup . " Clara and Alice had confided deep things and trivial things for so long that they knew each other to the heart . Clara thought about the confidences she and Mama had shared so long ago . Had it been what Katy said it was , a clinging in poverty , friendlessness , fear , and want ? " You 're worried , are n't you ? " Alice said . " Yes . " " Then we 'll make the marshmallows with your favorite , almond extract instead of vanilla . " Julia called later in the month . " Political action " was n't a class but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . It was an exploration of the truths the government had been denying its citizens . She sounded exhilarated . Then the calls stopped . When Clara called Julia 's dorm , the phone was answered by summer students who did n't know Julia or who said she was n't there . One girl said Julia might have gone to Chicago . Andy called the dean . No official trips had been planned , but there were dozens of unofficial campus groups , some of which had gone to demonstrate at the Democratic convention . They drove to Boulder . Julia had not been registered for summer classes . There had been teach-ins all spring , but they were not part of the curriculum . The dean said he would make inquiries . They went back home to wait , feeling inept and unsure . A week passed , during which one of them was always home and near the telephone . " We ran away , " Andy said , trying to reassure himself and Clara . " We left home like that , and we were all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand . She did n't confide in me , " Joey said . " She thought I was a nitwit , but she really hated this town . I thought she 'd be happy at the university because it is n't like Gold Flume . " Thomas said , " She kept telling me that what we 've been taught was n't true , and what the government says is all a lie . The history in books is a lie , too , told by the colonizing power . " As they waited , frightened but not knowing what to do , a call came from Chicago . It was the office of the district attorney of Cook County . A Julia Percival was in custody . The charges were rioting , creating a public nuisance , obstructing justice , and resisting arrest . Bail had been set at five thousand dollars . Clara and Andy left for Denver that afternoon . Julia was filthy , her hair matted . She looked skinny and skittery , and she stood before them raging at the police , using language that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the bail , she assumed he meant to free her group , and they argued . Clara tried to explain that school money was being spent on court appearances and plane trips . Julia said she was n't going back to school . " Their " school taught lies and deception . She was going to work with her group to further the work of truth and change . They stood in the interview room , which was summer-close and smelling of unwashed bodies , and they listened to Julia present a picture of the world as far from their experience as Cathay or Trebizond . Clara watched Andy deal with the courts , bail , police , a meeting with the assistant district attorney  --  could they get the charges reduced ? She thought she had seldom seen heroism like his . He went steadily on without self-pity , this man for whom jail and public shame were emblem and metaphor of all his childhood nightmares and betrayals . He paid his daughter 's bail , looking the way Civil War soldiers must have looked as they faced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | bewildered . Trial date , attorney , arraignment . They were the ancient and familiar words said of his father . Julia glided past his pain to embrace the misery of strangers . Arlo Percival had been chipper coming out of jail . Julia was angry , raging , arguing . To Clara it was one more willful choice . Julia said they had never understood her . Clara acknowledged that this was true . Julia said the individual was now irrelevant ; now all action was political and the individual only real as part of a group or faction . Clara said that an individual had paid Julia 's bail and supplied her with safety and food . Julia muttered rejoinders that Clara chose not to hear . They had a plane trip and the long ride back to Gold Flume , where the girl continued sulky and withdrawn . When Clara calmed down and asked Julia to explain , the girl 's explanations were incomprehensible to her . Clara tried without success to line up her world of experience with Julia 's , the way bullets are placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striae and blank spaces of their realities never met , never came to agreement under the questioning eye . There was n't even the shared meaning of the most basic words : work , class , power , history , teach ... . Andy and Clara argued . Why had n't Clara tried to be closer to Julia ? Why had n't she given Julia the example she needed , the teaching , the discipline ? Clara raged back at him . " Do you want a record of all the times , all the ways I tried , waiting , urging , telling , showing , begging for her confidence ? " " You were her mother . " " I still am , but she 's not a blank wall on which I write any message ? " They defended , glowered , pulled up each other 's secret shames , Andy 's idealized , invisible mother , Clara 's busy-ness , days too full of other people 's children . Then and later they were to drag the thing out and go at it again , like two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own heads .  | Julia spent the summer in Gold Flume , sulking around the house . " I ca n't talk to her , " Clara said . " You try . Will she go back to school or get work ? " Andy had no more luck than Clara . Julia blamed the legal sys-tem  --  how could she decide , when she had to be in Chicago in September ? They got the tickets and made the plans . Clara thought that by now the whole town must know about their troubles . Julia would n't be keeping the secret out of kindness to them . She thought their need for respectability was pretentious and hypocritical . A week before they were to leave , Andy and Julia argued . Andy remarked about the cost of Julia 's political consciousness . What was the money they were so interested in ? Julia shouted back at him . It was only paper , printed and controlled by the power elite for the subjugation of the masses . The next day she was gone . Joseph told them she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty dollars from him . Their car had been left at the Callan railroad station . Joseph 's tone was awed . " She blew five thousand dollars bail money just like that . " Clara had to go to school then , Andy to work , and coming home in the late afternoon , they went into Julia 's room , the sunny bedroom with its view of the mountains . Andy muttered , " I wonder if there 's a place where the deceivers and the disappointers meet to plan the pain they cause . She 'll meet her grandpa . " Clara realized then that his pain was greater than hers . In spite of all he knew , intellectually , he could n't keep from a nagging suspicion that a seed of inherited flaw had been saved in his body , carried carefully from his father to his daughter  --  Arlo lived on in Julia , with Arlo 's willfulness and without Arlo 's charm . They paid the state of Illinois five thousand dollars . It was almost one-third of Andy and Clara 's combined income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , not to save or protect anyone or to give anyone pleasure or to take away a moment of any-one 's pain . Julia had left without a backward glance . Autumn passed and winter with no word .  | Julia 's arrest and disappearance muted the sounds from the outside world . In Denver , rioters camped at the university . In Boulder they shouted down a speaker . Into TV cameras people screamed a junk shop of righteous grievance and political cant . To Andy and Clara , it all went like words swallowed in fog . The sound had been turned down by their own grief and bewilderment . The Vietnam War stopped for them . But it had not stopped for the rest of the world . In May , John and Sallie Austin 's son , John Jr. , died in a rice paddy . The pharmacy was closed for two days and the whole town went to the church and then to the graveyard . Clara told some school anecdotes , and other people recalled funny or touching moments . Such a binding had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that buried him on his way to a heart attack victim . After the ceremony , Clara walked over to Peter Tavistock 's grave . At the edge of the graveyard , some wild roses were budding . She dug up a clump and set it before his stone . Later that summer at Abner Matske 's funeral , she noticed that someone had pulled the shrub up and scattered the canes nearby . Peter 's grave lay bare . Late that summer a woman called saying she was a friend of Julia 's . She had seen Julia at a political commune near Ojai , California . Julia was well but " nervous . " Joseph and Tom got cards on their birthdays , and Julia said they could write to her care of general delivery , Ojai . Clara wrote , but there was no reply . " It 's nice to know she 's alive , at any rate , " Clara confided to Alice , " and I 'll get used to her being alive in places and conditions I know nothing about . " They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late raspberries . They had had a pleasant , desultory argument about the chokecherries just coming in . For years they had been studying the seasons of wild fruit , trying to predict their  | ripest weeks . Alice got up , groaning with the effort . " This backache wo n't go away . Did you hear  --  there 's a woman doctor corning to the new office in Callan ? " " Let 's go down and stare at her through the window . I miss Dr. Pratt . " They went back inside to begin cleaning up . Clara told Alice that Thomas and Andy had joined the fire department . " He 's a good man , Thomas is , and smarter than he thinks . He says when lie 's through school he wants to go on at the county , a heavyequipment operator , like Oliver . He says he likes to overwhelm his problems with labor rather than transcending them with brilliance , the way Joey does . Joey will go into the navy . " " You wanted college so badly for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have the money anymore . " " Sin of hope , and hope is in us to stay . "  | Denver was beginning its own boom , and the cliffs-andcanyons silhouette of its rising skyline was shown to Gold Flume in the background of the six o'clock news . Much of that skyline was the work of Ernest Reiber , the development tycoon . In the year Thomas graduated high school , Reiber announced plans for a theme park in the foothill suburbs of Denver . The park was to have a western motif and would be called Bonanza . People all over the state were buying stock . " Well , old girl , should we take a flutter ? " Andy asked Clara one evening . " If we mortgage the house we can recoup the loss , even the trips to Chicago .... "  | She shook her head . " I 'd be too nervous . The shares would become like a savings account , and what if they fell ? " " They ca n't fall ; half the town 's gone in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk players are deep into it . The Austins have shares , and Carl and Alice , Anderson at the bank has shares , and so do the ski area people . We 'd feel like fools if everyone got rich and we were left behind because of caution ; and cowardice . " " But we are cautious and cowardly , " Clara said . " I 'd be up all night , worrying . Did you say the Bogards ? Carl ? Alice ? " " Yup . Conservative Carl , accumulating Alice , even they . People who do n't know how to read a stock market report are scanning the Wall Street Journal over their cornflakes . Your very own sons are making plans . " " Did they say so ? " " Joseph says that if he does n't go into the service , he 'll try to get on there as a laborer . Thomas ca n't wait to get through high school to go down there . " Everyone 's eyes were wide with expected wealth . Alice often stopped in at Clara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat by the fire and talked , but their conversation was muted and Alice looked drawn . " It 's range-feeding time . Storms can ruin everything , but it 's more than that . The kids have left the valley and we realize now that none of them will be coming back to take up ranching . When that sank in , something went out of ranching for us . I 'm worried , too . " She looked out at the still-fresh snow banking Clara 's yard . " We 've borrowed money , too , quite a bit . " Clara was able to respond without surprise : " Ranchers are always borrowing  --  you 've told me so yourself , against the calves , against beef prices for feed and equipment ? " " This is different . We borrowed to buy that Bonanza stock . When we thought at least one of the kids would come in with us , it did n't matter that we were n't big money ahead . The ranch has  | always fed us well and put a roof over our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how it will be when he has to hire people to do what we 've always done ourselves . It sounds funny , but we never needed to be rich before , and now we do . " When Clara told this to Andy , his face clouded . " It 's crazy . It 's crazy gold fever , Clar . I 've let people in town think we 've invested in the thing , too . No one talks about anything else , so when people ask you , do n't say no . Maybe then , they 'll stop trying to convince us . " " How much should I say we 've invested ? " " You do n't have to say . Just do n't tell anyone we 're not . People are selling stock they 've had for years to buy in on this and the Bogards are n't the only ones borrowing to get more . " " You 're scaring me . " " I 'm scared myself . Last month I thought we might be foolish , but this stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth like that . " " Should n't we warn Alice and Carl ? " " Do n't you think I 've tried ? No one 's ready to listen . " Joseph wanted to join the navy but was inducted , while he waited , into the infantry . He trained in California , from which the expectation was that he would be sent to Vietnam . Clara steeled herself . In February he came home on leave , and , when he returned to camp , was posted to Germany . " I 'd be lying if I said I was sorry about these orders , " he wrote , " and they can reassign me at any time , but so far so good . They may even give me some training that will be useful in civilian life . " Clara went up to Alice 's , sat in her living room and cried with relief . March came , and the heavy snows . They would all remember it as an ordinary night early in April . Ski season was beginning to wane , with only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college students and the church trip skiers from Oklahoma and Kansas . There was an easier , more relaxed atmosphere in town . Gold Flume looked almost as it had been , as it would be in its pictures . Clara had been at her desk , planning her spring project ; Andy was studying some paperwork . He would soon be needing someone in the office to handle that for him . The TV was on and the news was running only half-heard , so the bulletin was almost over before they were both shocked into awareness . " Andy ? " " Wait ! " The announcement was over . Andy began turning to the other channels that Gold Flume received , flipping past breaks and commercials . Then , they sat mesmerized and unbelieving . Reiber Construction was in bankruptcy . The empire had collapsed . The picture in Clara 's mind was of the demolition of a huge building . She had seen pictures of such demolitions , the ( building suddenly gone to a painted image of itself , a scrim thirty stories high , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airy shivers , and only at contact with the ground the bricks becoming bricks again . The Reiber empire had folded in on itself and lay a ruin , and a cloud of dust was rising at the collapse . Clara said slowly , " I 'll need to call Alice  --  they 'll be out working , maybe , and wo n't have heard ? " " We 'll get the full story from the paper tomorrow , so we 'll know more .... " Andy had to go as far as Aureole for the papers , which were sold out everywhere else . In January , an electrician named Elton Yarborough had gone to the accounting offices of Reiber Construction . He was owed $148.48 for wiring an entryway sign to the Bonanza theme park the previous October . The disbursement officer had given him a check , which had bounced . Yarborough went to the county courthouse in Denver and filed a mechanic 's lien . In late February , one of the vice-  | presidents of the corporation got a call from Denver Industrial Finance . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put through because of a lien entered against the company . The vice-president told the finance company to wait a week until the oversight could be taken care of . The month passed . Denver Industrial called the Reiber people . The interest rate for the loan had been good only until the fif teenth of February . They could no longer make the loan at the old rate . The Reiber man figured the new rate , at a half percent higher . On five million dollars it was prohibitive . A vice-president of the Consolidated Bank of Denver called Reiber . The bank 's short-term note was supposed to have been paid by Denver Industrial Finance . Where was the money ? Reiber said there was a temporary problem . The bank called Denver Industrial . Two weeks later , agents of the Consolidated Bank of Denver appeared at Bonanza 's building site with trucks and a warrant . They picked up tools , lumber , cable , and 136 cases of light bulbs . The employees on the site left immediately and began filing for back pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood each part before going on . They explained it to each other , but Clara , in spite of the words , was seeing a breeze lift the curtain that had been a building , as the tvhoomp of the charge reverberated . On the twenty-fifth of the month , potential investors and representatives of the First Bank of Dallas came on the site . They were working on a six-million-dollar loan for Bonanza and another six million for Reiber 's other buildings in Denver . They saw that the work had been stopped and the area sealed off . They went back to Dallas and called the Consolidated Bank of Denver . C.B.D . called Chase Manhattan , which froze Reiber 's account . Eighteen hundred employees immediately filed for  | back pay , some of it owing since January . The scrim shivered and fell lightly as a veil , and the bricks became bricks as they shattered against the ground . Two days ago , the Denver Post said , Reiber Construction and Reiber Associates had filed for bankruptcy of a 216-million-dollar building empire . Elton Yarborough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't one of them guys pay me right then ? They got that in pocket change . People been riding past my house shakin ' their fists like I was to blame for all this . " Andy put the paper aside for Clara to take to the Bogards . The town will go into another bust , " he said . " Everyone but us and the Frenches was in on Bonanza . " He looked weary all of a sudden , old in a way he must look to young people who had n't known him when he was young himself . " I never wanted to live in a boom-bust environment , " he said , shaking his head . " It 's too much like living with Arlo , all flash and no substance . Maybe that 's why I felt strange about all this . It stank of Arlo 's grandiosity . Empire . The word alone is enough to make me check my wallet and lock up the family silver . " " The Bogards , " Clara said . " Alice told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in his arms . " We 'll go up there together , " he said . They had n't heard the news . They had been midwifing three calves born early and had come home late and exhausted , had washed up and fallen into bed . In the morning , Carl said , he turned on the local ranch news for the weather and the cattle prices , assuming that the world around them would n't collapse in a day , the weather being fine and the prices holding . His only fear had been of a sudden freeze or a heavy snow . Clara and Andy delivered the paper and left as one would leave a house of sudden mourning . They went home and came back again that night on the pretext of helping with the calves .  | They brought things to eat , cooked them , and heard the extent of the Bogards ' loss , money borrowed against the dream of hiring full-time ranch help , doing repairs , getting a hedge against all the ranchers ' dangers of weather and disease . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we may lose the ranch , " Carl said . Alice tried to comfort him . " We started out with debts this bad , and we climbed out ? " " We 'll see , " he said . Alice got up gingerly . " I have an appointment with Dr. Hudson this week . It 's my back again . I 've been there four times and nothing seems to help . " " It 's just strain , " Carl said , with an edge of bitterness , " lifting those calves and bucking bales at your age . We 're not kids anymore . When we started I could wrestle bull calves all day . I 'm smarter now  --  but the energy is n't there anymore . If only the boys would ? " and he shook the thought away . Gold Flume , too , was under a pall . The Austins had counted on Bonanza money to expand their drugstore . They had borrowed heavily . The people at the bank were grim , and they were followed by rumors , a wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night streets of the town . Had the Gold Flume bank gone into Reiber 's debacle ? Had the bank officers embezzled depositors ' money to invest in the stock , thinking it was a sure thing ? People stared and looked away . " I started the deception to stop being nagged at , " Andy said , " I never said we had invested , but only nodded and looked eager . Now I nod and look grim , but it feels wrong . And now the bank officers are all having to defend themselves against shadow accusations and suspicion . People want villains , and Reiber is too far away . People are asking why the bank officers did n't warn them against the archfiend from Denver . People are saying that the bank officials , Clint Anderson and Bill Cleveland , cooked  | the books . It 's all wrong and stupid . People are shunning Clint and Bill in the street and the wildest rumors are going around . I think Bill will have to leave town . The bank did go in , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The truth is that boom-and-bust is what we are  --  what we 've always been . Why did Arlo stay so long in this area when I was a kid ? It suited his style . Before the fancy changes , these roads were named Jackass Pass and Jackass Road . Jackass Road was where the miners carried out the ore and left the hole . " " Then no one knows how much was invested ? " " No , and no one knows how much was lost because no one has come out with an accusation . It 's all bubbling and boiling in a whisper . Looks . Stares . " Andy shook his head . Clara shivered . She had one of the random connections in thought that made Andy say women were a separate species . She had watched him working . He had been coming home to sit up with office work every night . " You said you would get some help . It 's eight o'clock most days before you 're home . " " My mistress has been upset about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stupid mistress to type and run office machines ? With all the work you put out , it 's a wonder you are balancing it at all . Tell her to quit buffing her nails and get busy " " My mistress : seductive skills , A ; office skills , F. Besides , her perfume makes the janitor 's dog cough . What goes into the Voice : Wanted  --  brilliant and beautiful secretarial genius . Low pay , long hours ; no chance for advancement ' ? " " I 've got someone for you . " " Who ? " " Chessie French . " Outside the window , four crows flew up from the creek , and Andy said , " See ? Everyone is shocked . " But Clara could see he was thinking . " I would train her , " she said .  | Chessie was Frances French 's youngest , one of those sudden surprises repudiating nature , nurture , logic , and cause-and-effect to restate the wild-card , random gifts of fortune . She was pretty , steady , aware , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her serene way through grade school , acknowledging but not accepting the laughter and malice everyone heaped on the Frenches . When Chessie was in junior high , Clara saw there were jobs for her , and by high school Clara was studying ways to get her a college scholarship . The more she thought about it , the better Clara liked the idea of Chessie working for Andy . She had thought of Chessie in one of those leaps of the mind , having begun with thoughts of the shameful rumors going around Gold Flume in the wake of the Reiber empire 's collapse . Chessie had grown up in such a sea of scorn and ridicule . From the moment she was old enough to walk through town , she must have been aware of the looks , the words , the laughter no one bothered to suppress in her presence . Her brothers , cousins , and uncles were drunks and part-time criminals . Buster French , her father , was now a bootlegger and fence , when he worked at all . The family compound was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Year by year its reputation had grown along with the rolls of stolen barbed wire , conduits , empty fuel drums , and rat-busy garbage . Their jury-rigged electrical system made the Frenches place one big fire hazard . Chessie , coming out of all that , had run errands since she was ten , baby-sat since she was twelve , and had , apparently on her own , learned to be neat , wellspoken , and utterly dependable . " You keep the books .... " " Yes , but Chessie can learn  --  I ' 11 teach her . " " As long as I get the work done . " " It 's practically done , now . " Clara could see that Andy was allowing himself to be convinced . " You 're smiling , " he said .  | She nodded . " Something smiles inside when there 's a chance like this . It 's like the smile on one of those old Greek statues . " " It 's a smirk , if you ask me . " A letter came from Las @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in San Pablo and the old folks still remember you . Do n't open it . TB has flared up again . Going south . If somebody shows up , charge them plenty . Tell them you had to buy other investors off . The man who came for the package was a federal officer . When he began to explain his purpose , Andy excused himself and left the room . Clara gave the officer coffee and cookies and they talked about Arlo . " He was a wonder , in a way . Ninety years old and still running scams ... a rap sheet as thick as War and Peace . " " He said he had been in San Pablo  --  he was scamming my old friends down there , was n't he ? " " He told them he was your dad . " " But  --  I 'm still in touch with those people  --  why did n't they let me know ? " " Embarrassment , probably . I do n't think he got much . It takes a lot of energy to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see too many very old people doing it . " " Where is he now ? " " He 's gone , Mrs. Percival . " " Escaped ? " " Died , and under odd circumstances , which is why I 'm here . There was a package supposed to contain diamonds hidden in molten glass , which had been formed into something .... "  | Clara got the package . " Size of a breadbox , " she said , and handed it to the officer . " Has anyone called about this , or come ? " " No . " The officer cut the double strings and pulled away the oldclothes wrapping . It was a glass paperweight . " Nice piece , " the officer said , holding it up in the warm afternoon light . " Worth ten dollars of anybody 's money . " Clara took up the paperweight . " You said he was dead . Is there a body ? " " He 'd left San Pablo , as he said . It happened near Tucson . He was found under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . odd circumstances . He had no ID . After what investigation they were able to make , they buried him down there , thinking he was a vagrant . The inquiry was sent out on a priority five , and I did n't get it for two months so he 'd already been buried . If you want to exhume , I have the location . " " No , " Clara said , wanting to add , " He hated it here , " but afraid the officer would think her foolish . " Is this paperweight evidence ? " " It 's evidence of the gullibility of about four hundred people . Keep it . I 'm going to leave you twenty of my cards . Tell whoever shows up that the piece was taken as contraband by the government . We do n't want his family inheriting some thwarted investor 's anger . " Clara called Alice , planning to exult in the plans for Chessie and ask about her doctor 's visit . She was also bursting with the news of Arlo . The line was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was slow and seemed to stick to the words . " I was just calling you . " Clara began to dread . " What is it , Alice ? " There was a pause . " It 's bone cancer , " Alice said , " in four places . "  | Alice went on , giving a doctor 's words about chemotherapy and radiation , but Clara was struggling too hard against the shock to hear meaning in them . " I want to see you , " Clara said . There was another pause . " The kids are coming up this weekend to help out , and I 'll have the painkillers that will let me work as long as I can . " " I want to help , too . " " You will , but not now . Later I 'll need to remember the books we read , all the canning seasons and the mushroom seasons and the talk we had , to go over it all with you before it 's too late .... " Clara put down the phone and cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come home and called him at work , and was oddly comforted by his gasp at the other end of the line when he received the news .  | T L hree days after Alice 's halting words over the phone , Clara went up to see her and they wept together and went over the details : the spread of the cancer , the plans her doctors proposed , the symptoms , the tests , the findings . Alice was still able to work around the house and her daughters would come when she no longer could . " And when can I come ? " asked Clara . " Come up on Saturday . Come up to sew and garden . I need to stop dwelling on this .... " Later , Clara went down to the French compound to talk to Frances about Chessie . It was years since Clara had seen  | Frances , but rumor kept her current . She had heard that Frances was a drunk now , bitter and foul-mouthed . For all her presence in town , Frances might as well have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversion from worry and sorrow over Alice , whose illness was made worse by her agonizing over the Reiber debacle . When she crossed the Frenches ' footbridge , which must have been replaced many times since she had gone over it all those years ago , Clara felt altogether removed from the present Gold Flume . She remembered the small , quick little girl who had been Frances Legrand : " Teacher , Miz Percival ? them books ? " and the gentle , almost reverent way she had taken them . It was a sweet memory and Clara had used it , unfolding it now and then to hang before herself in times of need . She had kept it separated from the later memories of Frances , preferring that resolutely naive and credulous child . The compound had added buses and grown . Like cancer , Clara thought , and had to stop and clear her eyes of tears , her mind of Alice 's face . The litter had grown , too , and lines of barbed wire were hung with bottles and scrap metal , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scare away wild dogs . All the snow had melted here . There was no tactful covering of the mounds of rubbish . A clamor of tin cans , strategically placed , brought out an old woman who stopped defensively behind a fifty-gallon drum to stare at Clara . She was stooped and stringy , with a belly poking out from under her sagging sweater . Clara looked again and saw that missing teeth had caved in the face of a relatively young woman . " Frances ? " " Hi , " Frances said . " Come on through and have a beer . " Clara started to refuse but stopped , nodded and walked through the narrow aisle in the litter . Frances 's hand was still up , as though shielding her eyes from morning light . There was a defensiveness in her posture that reminded Clara how Frances had never been able to get beyond people 's scorn the way Chessie was able to do .  | " Come on up . " Frances motioned to the gravel-filled container that made a step up to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved so that Clara could follow . The interior had been gutted and fitted with a woodstove and some bed frames and tables . Clara wondered where Chessie slept . How did she keep clean in this tangle , years of it , winters freezing and summers baking ? Clara , who had used her own poverty-blighted childhood as a yardstick by which to judge all the poverty she had seen thereafter , was shocked into the revelation that her life had been a magnitude 's remove from what she saw and smelled here . Frances went to a bucket in the corner and pulled out three tall boys , popped the tabs expertly , and handed one to Clara , possibly conscious of the closeness and stench in the bus . She said , " Let 's take this outside  --  it 's warm enough out there by now . " Clara , whose eyes had just grown accustomed to the gloom , now saw three small children staring at her from places on the clothing-strewn floor . One of them had started to cry . Frances paid it no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud of the yard and around to the back of the bus . There was a cleared place with three benches that faced away from the compound and into the now-leafless tangle of brush and a few pine trees . It was sun-warmed , out of the wind , and perfectly clean of trash . " Chessie and me made this , " Frances said , " and the boys and them do n't know about it , just only Chessie and me and Grandma Daisy French and Grandma Legrand . Sit down . " Clara began to sit cautiously . " Do n't worry , these benches here 'll hold you . " Her words were difficult to understand , coming past her missing teeth . They had their beer , Frances drinking deep , Clara sipping for companionship 's sake . After a while Frances said , " Buster 's gone again and I do n't know if he 's coming back or not . " " Who else lives here with you ? " Clara gestured back at the other buses .  | Frances began to count them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people Clara had forgotten were still alive , old people and children , mostly . " You here about one of the kids ? " There was a way to help Chessie , Clara told her . She and Andy would train Chessie , who could work afternoons and Saturdays during her last year of high school and then for two or three years full-time , saving for college . Clara would tutor Chessie so she could go for a full scholarship . Frances listened , finishing her own beer and then another , and then the one Clara had started and left . Frances had once been easy to read , her emotions coming and going on her face unchecked , and this was one of the things that had made her so vulnerable and easily seduced . By now , the hard years had taken the trust out of her and Clara had no idea what her mind was saying behind the unchanged expression . " Chessie 's different , ai n't she ? " Frances said . " Yes , " and Clara thought , You were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do what she wants , but I 'll tell her you come . " " I thought you should know what we were thinking , Andy and I. " Frances nodded , sniffed . Clara looked at her and said quietly , " How have you been ? I have n't seen you in so long . " Fortified by the beers , Frances began to talk . Her slurred words were n't maudlin or raging , but hard , simple , and bitter . She told Clara things about Gold Flume , about its people and the life the Frenches lived here . Some of it Clara knew , but knew in another way , a softer way . Some of it Clara had n't known , and Frances painted the people of the town in colors darker than Clara had ever seen them . It was another hour before she got up . Frances motioned to her and said , " This here 's better , " and fed Clara by another way to the footbridge without thanks or  | good-bye . Two days later , Chessie came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for him . Clara began to spend Saturdays up at Alice 's , and at first their friendship seemed as easy as it had ever been , but both of them achieved this only by ignoring all that was foremost in their minds , the Bogards ' losses at Bonanza and Alice 's present dying . They talked about Arlo , about the development , Flume Heights , that was now across the Jackass Pass road from the Percivals ' house . The company had widened and paved the road , and the development had arrived in explosions of dust and granite . Lines of trucks , poundings like an immense buried heart , had followed , then houses , rows of them , obedient and trim , eyes front . " I remember how it was when someone new came up Placer Gulch , " Clara said . " Mama would clap her hat on and we would rush over to visit , happy , curious , and , Mama said , with a cake to get us in ' to look and talk . Were they friendly ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And now we have fifty new neighbors and it 's all I can do to pass the place , it 's so daunting . I am going to visit the ones with kids . I have sworn to ! " And Clara was gratified to hear Alice 's old laugh . The second time Clara came , they discussed the bankruptcy at Reiber , edging closer to what was hardest . " That collapsing building was so huge that it 's still falling , " Clara said . " Six new people have just come to Gold Flume and started their youngsters in school for these last nine weeks . They were all engineers and builders from Reiber 's Denver mess . The ski area hired them for its expansion . Did I tell you ? The company 's bought Grubstake , the whole mountain , and it 's going to build another ski resort and a huge lodge ; a whole valley will be full of chalets . " Alice looked dully at Clara . Death dust and ruin dust had clouded her vision so she could n't imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that means ? " " No . " " It means that the ski area people bought stock individually , but the company itself did n't . It 's growing , and that means the Reiber mess did n't hurt Gold Flume , because most of the skiers come here from out of state . Land prices are going to soar , so if your kids want to sell the ranch , and if they can hold out for a few years or so , they 'll be rich in a way they never could have been by raising stock . " " Is that supposed to cheer me up ? Carl and I put a lifetime into the ranch . You 've grown up in mining  --  the land for you was something like an impediment . Earth was there to be pulled away , blasted and chiseled away from what you were hoping to find . For us ? " " Damn it , Alice , I do n't expect anyone to cheer . The skiers are tourists ; they invest nothing and they do n't care where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Alice looked stricken and Clara gentled her voice . " The new people are a mixed blessing , sure . I do n't like it that Flume Heights blots out the stars with its lights or that the name Jackass Pass Road ' is n't good enough for them , but your family wo n't be n lined . The kids will be able to sell the ranch as they would have anyway , or they can make a dude ranch , or in any of a dozen ways come out richer than ever . " Alice 's tears began to follow one another more and more rapidly until she shook them away . " This dying biz has turned me stupid and self-centered . We invested and borrowed . Some part of Carl wants us to lose the ranch as a punishment , and because I ca n't think past the summer and I do n't have much energy , I 'm not fighting . " " Fight , Alice . This is one you can win . "  | The April ground swells with corm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips of departing snow . The spring beauty comes complete , and the pasqueflower . The arthritic fingers of wild apple branches hold blossom clusters in their thousands . " Quiet , " Andy says . " You can hear the branches pulling sap ! " Clara was grown and working in a war plant before she learned that willow , oak , and maple , which were shrubs in the valley , were trees elsewhere , taller than houses . In the valley , the green things had been humbled by the difficulties of growth and drought , cold , and short summers . Long ago they had learned  | not to hope so high or bud so early . The maple bush does n't leaf out until June . But the sweet cherry , the apple , the lilac , and the snowball bush are newer immigrants , and they have n't taken the password into the mnemonics of their genes . They are fooled every year into stretching and budding and leafing in the warm suns of March and April . They give and give , and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sudden freeze burns them black and shatters the sap-stained branch from the inside out , exploding it as from a lightning bolt . The freeze lasts a day or two and if the lilac still hopes itself green , the snow is yet to come . To the end of May , snow can drive through the valley , breaking branches , all those million lush shovels of leaves , and bowing the bush to ground and freezing it there . Then came strangers from sea-level places , all the motel people , orthopedic surgeons , engineers , shopkeepers , restaurant workers , all needing places to live . They bought houses in the developments south of town on familiar level land that the river had made , and then they came to the development up the hill to the north , to Flume Heights . These strangers came yearning for the green they had left far beyond these mountains . They sent to nurseries back east for their rosebushes and their azaleas , their oak trees and elm trees and weeping willows , flowers and shrubs , domesticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bud and freeze . Early in April the new doctor 's wife planted a dozen red Countess Someone rosebushes . Tyrone Legrand , the garbageman , took their blackened corpses away , coming across the road to snicker about it to Clara . " Roses ! What will they do next ? Did you see the weeping willow they got up that street ? Truck come and 1 ) 1 It it in ; I bet the clang thing 's ten feet high . Weeping . They 'll be the ones weeping . " And it was so . The April snows broke every branch and freeze-exploded the sap so the tree looked burned .  | " At least what you got here ca n't freeze , " Tyrone had said admiringly , pointing to Clara 's yard ornaments , twenty-seven of them now , at the east side of the house . " I remember when there was n't only ten or so . I thought coming up here was dying and going to heaven , seeing all them toys , the moving ones especially . " Clara neglected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Alice . Carl was usually out and that was a relief , because he now haunted house and barns , grieving from chore to chore about his ruin . The time of the land was past , his children had told him . In ten years the condominiums and town houses would be creeping up these hills and gulches and the valley beyond . Their land was near town , well watered and sheltered . It was prime land , but soon the whole thing would he taxed beyond any rancher 's ability to make a profit from cattle . So Carl walked , muttering answers to their invisible presences and to his creditors and to his wife , dying before his eyes . Through the spring , Alice 's pain was easily circumvented and she did her work , using different combinations of drugs to trick her body , but by July the amount she had to use to dull the pain was dulling her as well , and she lost the patience to relive old joys with Clara . She yearned for the slow opening of deep talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience made her weep with frustrated need . In July she lost even the desire for remembering . She argued with Clara , with Carl , with everyone , envying all of them their youth , life , consciousness , most of all their freedom from pain . By August she was visibly dying , beaten back to the solipsism of the baby , her world no wider than her bed . Clara had been aching with the loss of her best friend for three months before Alice died . " Why do you have to do parent visits at all ? " Andy asked . " In the old days it was a necessary thing . There are more children this year  --  three hundred in the school , you said ? " " It 's good to meet the mothers informally . It 's good for them to know me so I 'm not unapproachable , and this time I 'll be meeting them in small groups . I 'm going across the road Saturday afternoon for tea . Mrs. Treece is having it for the five new engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reiber folded . " " Saturday ... " Andy said , and then understood that it was Clara 's way of filling the day she had been spending with Alice . Andy had enjoyed Carl 's company and respected him . He was fond of Alice , but he had n't seen the ranch as a refuge or enjoyed the Bogards ' friendship the way Clara had . After the funeral they went up to the ranch , but Carl rebuffed them . His grief had metastasized into grievance and spread even to friends . " It 's too had , " Andy said , and was resigned . But for Clara , the ranch was another loss . She and Alice had gone berrying along its creeks and walked its meadows for more than thirty years , and she had begun to dream of the land in ruins , with its glades and grasslands burned . On the night before her meeting with the Flume Heights mothers , she had another kind of dream : The Flume Heights houses had merely been facades . Their formal and forbidding doors opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was summer . Clara and the mothers began to run , racing up the hill to the sky-dazed meadow where summer flowers lay tangled in the long grass . By the time evening came they had become friends . All the mothers looked like Alice , but at the different stages of her life . The pictures were so intense that Clara woke happy in their afterglow , aware of the dream 's metaphor . There would n't be another friend like Alice , with whom there were years to be shared , but new friendships might still come , and she might see past the size and grandeur of these houses to t he people who lived in them . Maybe one or two of the mothers would enjoy the books she did , or would like to hunt for wild herbs and forest mushrooms .  | " Here I go , " she said to Andy . " I will put on my new blue blouse with the frilly collar , and I will put my comb and handkerchief in my pocket , so I wo n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to Flume Heights and meet the mothers . " " Tea , huh ? " " Absolutely . Tea . Little cakes , too . Finger sandwiches . " " Is that like a knuckle sandwich ? " " You 'll get a knuckle sandwich . Go enjoy yourself caulking the windows . I have to wash my hair . "  | At the side of Rosalie Treece 's house the remaining ornamental tree had been eaten leafless by deer . The lawn lay baked brown , as did most of the others along the row . Rosalie saw Clara looking . " We ca n't get enough water for it . You water half an hour and the pressure falls to nothing all through the development . Then it runs muddy . " " I do n't think this grass is native here , " Clara said tactfully . " My petunias dried up in July , " Rosalie persisted , " and I got them right here in Aureole . " Clara smiled . " Oh , I know how to save them . " " How ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household water on them . We have petunias , pinks , and columbine , vegetables , too , and table herbs . The mountains are hard country , but if you take them on their own terms , they 'll let you have lots of things . " " We water them , but ... " " Use the water from your washer , your dishwater , and bath and shower water , and the water you collect when you run the faucets to get the water hot  --  all that ? " Rosalie was staring at her . " That would take buckets , carrying buckets of dirty water .... " Clara saw Rosalie 's surprise and distaste , felt a stab of loneliness keen as ice , and said , " It 's habit . I do it for my vegetables , my flowers , and for my trees . " She looked down and noticed a run in her stocking . They went into the house , making a tacit agreement to start again . There were only two other women there . " Carly was sick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The house was larger than it seemed from the outside . The close presence of all the other houses in the row had changed Clara 's sense of size . There were deep carpets on all the floors and heavy furniture in scale with the rooms , low tables that were sheets of plate glass resting on stone columns , huge couches , breakfronts , many lamps . Even in the bathroom there were things put out solely for decoration , interesting in themselves . Clara found the rooms daunting , but the heavy carpets and drapes sucked up the chatter and laughter of the women , so their sounds made no more than polite ripples in the deep pond of the living room . Rosalie Treece was younger than the others , married younger , Clara thought , and a mother sooner . Her children were in kindergarten and second grade . Mary Anne Van Dyke was the oldest , a large , plain woman with a maternal quality Clara found attractive . When Rosalie mentioned the dryness and starkness of the mountains they could see through the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised on a Nebraska  | farm , the country seemed lush and green to her . Helene Singleton shook her head incredulously . " You drive forever to get anyplace , and when you get there , there 's nothing . There 's not even a decent grocery store . " The tone was aggrieved . Clara felt a need to defend the valley towns , but she stifled it . As Helene talked on , bitterly , Clara realized that she was the focal point of the group . She was a tall , handsome woman , dressed with casual elegance . At first , Clara would have said she was beautiful , but as she studied Helene and tried to see where the beauty resided , she realized that the effect had been made not by nature , but by an incredible skill . Each feature had been studied , then its faults shaded back , its good points brought forward , and the whole brought into a harmony that made her ordinary features seem beautiful . She had done the same thing with her dress . Every line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negative ones . This was a study as rigorous as any literary or mathematical one . It required , Clara realized , a disciplined denial of personal vanity , a cold-eyed , clear-eyed assessment of features and posture . It gave Helene 's scorn an importance and validity it would not otherwise have had . " The town has grown so quickly and changed so much , there has n't been time to build the stores and businesses for people who live here , " Clara began , and was annoyed at herself for offering a defense . Helene went past her . " And then there 's that mess across the road , which we have to pass every day  --  Rancho Glorioso , the amusement park , we call it . They actually hang their clothes out , too , billowing underwear and all . Why does n't the development have it zoned out ? " Had Mary Anne Van Dyke said that , Clara would have laughed , and then they would all have laughed , but Helene 's elegance had created a space around her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development has no control over that house , " Clara said . " The house was there years , generations , before the  | development was built . Are the garden ornaments and drying clothes so visible from here ? " " See for yourself when you leave " ? Rosalie laughed ? " although I have to say our kids keep begging to go over . God knows who lives there . " " God does know , and so do I. " Clara tried for lightness . " Andy Percival and I live there , and your kids are as welcome as they can be . " There was utter silence , and then Mary Anne gave Clara her steady , countrywoman 's gaze and said , " What a wonderful way to get kids over their fear of school and the principal . How did you think of it ? " Clara began to explain the long-ago iron deer and the year-by-year additions , Andy 's impatience with the tradition , Julia 's joy and then her scorn . Mary Anne showed her understanding of the situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " About the laundry , " Clara said , " I did n't realize how much it showed . I ca n't put it west of the house  --  too many trees , and there 's the creek , but I 'll get Andy to turn the line poles so you do n't get the broadside view . " And Clara suddenly knew , as sure as snow in May , that the minute she left , Rosalie Treece would say , " She waters her flowers with used bathtub water . She carries buckets of it in and out ! " A terrible pang almost brought tears : Gulch girl . She wears her frilly blouse that 's too fussy and hangs all wrong , a countrywoman with work-roughened hands posing as a school principal . Then she made herself think , I 'm not here for their judgment . I 'm here to get to know the parents of my school . She said , " Bad as the amusement park is , the kids come up every year and there are stories connected with everything , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other in silence . " I do n't know why the school is so small , " Rosalie said . " Our kids are in temporary buildings and they wo n't be heated well enough . "  | Clara talked about the sudden growth in Gold Flume . Then she said to Mary Anne , " I know where you come from , because you told us . I do n't know where you are from , Rosalie , " and she saw Helene wince . Was she supposed to call them " Mrs. Treece " and " Mrs. Singleton " ? " We are from Atlanta . We planned to settle down there , but ... " Her words trailed away in the unexplainable reality of her present plight . How could we have ended up here , here in the bone-bare mountains of this inhospitable place ? Rosalie turned to Helene : " You grew up in Washington , D.C. , did n't you ? " " The Virginia side , " Helene said . " Helene designs clothes , " Rosalie explained . " She designed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that showed appreciation , thought of telling Helene more , and decided against it . Two of the three women had been in sororities in college . They had learned light conversation and social ease there . Clara felt another moment of loss . Helene Singleton was staring out the picture window with bleak distaste . Her husband 's job had landed her in a place she obviously hated , and with a talent she felt would go unused . She might have been a concert pianist in an Eskimo village . " Ten years ago , " Clara said , " we had a retired man here . He was fascinated with bats and knew all about them . I asked him to come up and teach , and he did . His enthusiasm was so contagious that a number of the children went on into zoology because of it . " Remembering that time , she felt herself relaxing . " There were bat lodges all over town ? " She looked at Helene , wondering if her example had been understood . Helene said , " Designing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thought you might share some of that talent with the children . The fifth- and sixth-grade girls are always drawing and doodling , and many of their ideas are about clothes . If you could  | guide that interest ... " It sounded weak in this overfurnished room , spoken to the elegant woman . " No , thank you , " Helene said coolly , and Clara heard the studied sound of a hundred sorority tea afternoons . " I 'm going to be in business here , " Helene said . " I 've designed a line of skiwear . Women have been skiing in men 's clothing , sized for women , with all the femininity of baseball uniforms . If people like my designs , I 'll be able to make the transition to New York with my other things . " Clara was awed . " Did you go to school  --  I mean to a fashion institute ? " The expression froze again . Clara wondered why she kept hitting cold walls in this woman whenever she moved . " I went to college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't encouraged to pursue careers . I was expected to be in college for the MRS. degree . They waste us . They waste our lives and our ambitions and our talents . " " They ? " Clara asked vaguely . Helene did n't answer , but bitterness had scored lines in her face that the makeup did n't blend or cover . They ate the little finger sandwiches then , and Clara was subdued and careful . ( What have I said ? How did I insult her ? ) Rosalie asked about cultural activities for the children , and Clara thought that here at least she might show the valley to advantage . The library was rudimentary , she explained , but there was interlibrary loan , so any book was available with only a two or three day wait . " Now we have the educational channel on TV , too  --  and plays , operas , theater ? " Clara felt herself breathing against the words , working hard . " I 'm a Hamlet fan . I got the Olivier version for school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lots of people from town came . The Derek Jacobi one ran on TV , and we have Richard Burton on cassette tapes at the library . That 's three Hamlets in three years . You do n't get that on Broadway in a decade . "  | " There 's no dance , no ballet ? " " Well ... I 've never seen a live performance up here , but some of us went down to Santa Fe one year for the opera , and people always go to Central City .... " She was trying too hard . " Gold Flume is n't Athens , " she said , " but it 's not Yonville or Gopher Prairie , either . We have a professional chamber music group playing in Aureole every other year  --  and really , how many concerts and ballets did you go to in Washington or Atlanta ? " Then she looked up and saw the anger in Helene Singleton 's face . She had hit a target she had n't even seen with a weapon she was n't aware of using . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hire you for the Chamber of Commerce , " Mary Anne chuckled , and it was , for the moment , all right again . When Clara left , she was careful to note the unfolding view of her washline and the painted animals , plaster gnomes , windmills , and flapping ducks that Helene had called an amusement park . That night she said to Andy , " Your underwear has gone public . We 'll need to turn the washline and I 'm going to give my frilly blouse to the gypsies . We 'll put in a line of willow shrubs on the east , but before that ... " " Do n't those people wear anything underneath ? " he asked . " No one knows . They all have clothes dryers . " " They really got to you , did n't they ? " " She got to me , Helene Singleton . " " Singleton ? I had lunch with Hugh Singleton today . He 's new on the fire department , a nice guy . He 's in love with these mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick , anything , when Reiber went belly-up . All of them were desperate , and they had n't been paid in three months . He said he would have taken a job in hell redesigning their brimstone delivery . " " They must be husband and wife , then . " " Two kids , two little kids ? " She nodded .  | " Well , " Andy said , " he did twenty minutes on how they came over Victory Pass , how the mountains looked  --  I even remember some of what he said . I felt like I was in at the beginning of Creation , before God clothed the bones , ' and The snow on those peaks was a part of the first snow that ever fell . ' Poetic ? " and they stared at each other in wonder . After supper Clara took Andy to look at the amusement park and see how they could move the washline pole . Behind the Percival place the mountains lifted up and away . It was true that they had been scarred and laced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah , Martha 's Cut , Bendimeer and Bendixen . They were all leaching yellow and fanning a spew of tailings from their silent mouths , but could n't those people see how the light poured over it all and blessed everything ? " The nights here used to be velvet-black as an emperor 's pockets , " Clara said , " and the stars used to tremble and catch their edges in the trees over there .... " She sighed . " We 'll move the line and plant the willow , but by the time it blocks out the ducks ? " " Those damn ducks , " Andy said , " and the damned windmill . " ? by that time the haters will probably be gone . " Because Elton Yarborough was owed $148.48 , Reiber Construction in Denver had collapsed . Because of that , four women had been put together in a living room in Gold Flume , Colorado , two of them hating it and one perhaps becoming estranged from a husband who had fallen into his spiritual home . Two days later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wind howled it down the gulches and beat the withering snow over the passes . It was just a dusting , but the leaves of all the remaining imported trees lay in their broken branches in black and frozen heaps .  | The Gold Flume bank managers and their families left town and the question of whether or not money had been embezzled ( or Reiber stock was answered in the negative by the new directors . Still , the rumors continued to drift on like the stench of a dead animal days after its death . The Treece children had come into school and the Singletons , but there were also Cyril Boda 's grandchildren . " How many children and grandchildren did I expect to see through school ? " Clara mused to Andy . " The Bogard kids left , Peter Tavistock and Johnny Austin are dead , Lucinda moved and never married .... "  | " You teach two Bordereau grandkids . " " Yes , Frenches and Matskes , too , " she said ruefully . " I 'll retire in five years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tutoring " You may have to , " Andy said quietly . " Land values may have gone up , but land taxes have trebled . We may be forced to sell off some of this acreage . " " I do n't want to leave the valley . " " If we have to , we can sell the south seven acres . Did I tell you ? Millburn Tavistock died the other day . For God 's sake do n't go down there with a casserole again . " Clara laughed . " What will Dorothy do ? Live in that crumbling mausoleum all alone ? " " If she sells , she can get a fortune . That place is bad for a house but great for a saloon . " Developers bought the land the Frenches had been squatting on , and after a hard fight they were resettled near Bluebank . Chessie got the developers to haul the family 's buses to the new site . The place was leveled , the creek given new banks with a sort of levee , and a street of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fashion boutique , and in it a section of skiwear . It was Helene Singleton 's Nini . Clara read about it in the Ute River Voice : HIGH FASHION COMES TO GOLD FLUME . The article said that the outfits had hardly been displayed before they were sold out . " Singleton has gone from the sewing room in her house to the old Phillips garage , where four workers will be cutting and sewing her fashions . We will be seeing the Nini logo , a big N with NI on each upstroke , reminiscent of a mountain silhouette , being worn by women skiers on our slopes and , as time goes by , perhaps worldwide . " " I met your nemesis today , " Andy said , " the lady herself . At the Chamber of Commerce lunch . " " What did you think ? "  | " Nice girl . Homey type . " He was grinning . " I do n't know what I liked more about her , her gentle kindness or the selfeffacing charm she radiates . Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gone all spidery on you , has she ? Not enough action ? " " I never choose my nemeses ; they choose me . " " Wrong . Had you caved in , Ma T. would have liked you well enough . It 's the same with this here new one . I 've got to hand it to you , though , your nemeses are top-drawer . " " She is amazing , though  --  what she makes of herself . " " True , but do n't get in a gunfight with her . The bullets will ricochet off her corners . " The long , golden autumn passed and the ski season began . The streets of Gold Flume were crowded with skiers and the beer halls threw open their doors , filling the streets with light and noise . The skiers had so much heat from their youth that it flowed out with their singing , their laughing , their drinking , and poured out into the icy night streets so none of the saloons needed to close their doors . In November , the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bruising his face and hip . His parents declared they would sue his teacher , Clara , and the school . There were conferences and sleepless nights , worry about lawyers , recriminations . At first Clara had been dumbstruck . " Children fall ! " she cried to Andy , and then to the county 's lawyer , Mr. Clayton . " " They fall running or climbing or in any number of ways . What is ' due care ' ? We tell them to hold on when they swing . A lawsuit never happened to us before . " She felt herself turning grim and fearful . The boy recovered and the idea of the suit faded , but Clara and the teachers had been changed in small but profound ways . They were all warier , more defensive , and the worriers among them  | besieged Clara with their nightmares . Could a child slip on the wet floor in a bathroom ? If a teacher put a scarf on a little child in such a way that he could remove it , and he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the children to school . What if .. . A Chinese family came and opened a restaurant in Callan . The black family of a construction worker came and there were racial slurs on the playground . Again , Clara stopped school for a day and called an assembly . This time she was prepared for criticism but took no pleasure in her preparation . " It used to be fun , " she murmured , communing with the memory of Alice Bogard as she walked up the hill to home . In these months of early darkness , the gassy glare of reflected light from town now followed her up the hill . " It used to be such a joy ! " Andy was a good listener and a wise advisor , but he was n't good with plain worry or agonizing or things for which nothing could be done . Sometimes she had talked to Alice about family things Andy did n't want to hear . Then she lightened . After three hitches in the army , taking college courses when he could , Joseph had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had been working with a small computer printing company , designing systems . He lived in Denver and seemed happy there . Physically , he was the image of Arlo Percival , complete with the mane of hair , the grace , the easy smile , and captivating laugh . Now and then he would bring young women up to Gold Flume , one , then another . At first Andy was suspicious , but it was the quality of the young women that changed his mind . In the beginning , Andy had muttered to Clara , " Why should n't he have lots of them ? Women fall for charm , do n't they ? " " These are n't pushovers off the farm , " Clara said . " He 's been in the service and in school for years  --  Arlo would n't have lasted under that discipline for seven minutes . " " I know .... " Something in Andy relented a little . Then he came to ski with a girl named Barbara once , and  | then again . " This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara and Joseph were engaged , and the next June they were married in Denver . At their wedding Thomas met Gudrun , Bar-bara 's housemate from Norway . That Christmas , Thomas went to Norway to meet Gudrun 's family . Clara and Andy traveled to Bergen in August to be at the wedding , agreeing wistfully with Gudrun 's also wistful parents that the young couple , wherever they chose to live , would make someone sad . Thomas got a job in Denver as a heavy-equipment mechanic . Julia had been moving , now west , now south , staying awhile , moving on . In the last years she had been letting them know where she was . Clara sent news of the weddings . After Thomas and Gudrun had married , Julia wrote a letter . Dear Mother and Fathcr , Moan and Dad , Clara and Andy , It 's true  --  I do n't know what to call you . I 've been away so long and had so many lives since I left Gold Flume that my time there seems to have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telescope . At the same time , I find parts of that life sticking to me even now . It 's because I 'm a mother myself . Liberty was born , you would say , out of wedlock . I had the wedlock twice , and it was lock , all right , so now I 'm staying with someone , and either of us is free to leave at any time . We 've lived in different communes , as you know , and in one of them we took Native American names . I kept mine after the commune broke up , so I use that now , and if you use it , too , the mail will get to me sooner . My name was SoulDancer , but it 's so hard in this society to have only one name that I took another , so I 'm Anna SoulDancer . I started this letter to say something like good luck on the occasion of Joseph 's and Thomas 's marriages , but I do n't believe  | in personal ceremonies , really . Things change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves on inevitable birthdays , anniversaries , all of that ? " Why are we reading this ? " Andy asked . " Why is n't the SoulDancer family reading it ? " We are having our victories . Young people are learning from us the things I had to find out on my own .. . " She 's having better luck than we did , " Andy said . ... and while liberation may take longer than we had planned , things are moving and I guess that inspired me to write this letter . The West offers little if you do n't like waterskiing or lying in the sun . I 'll be moving away from California . Mexico is a place that appreciates single mothers . Women are respected there , and children are loved . We will go there soon and I 'll write as soon as I get settled . When Clara finished the letter she and Andy sat and looked at one another and then they started to laugh , first slowly and then in gusts . They laughed without knowing why , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your daughter " ? and Andy hooted again ? " your daughter certainly knows how to spread joy ? " " Stop it  --  it hurts too much to laugh anymore . " " SoulDancer ? I wonder what that dance is . " " The dance you do when you stick your finger in the light socket , " and they were off again . " Why are we laughing ? " Clara had written steadily over the years to Julia 's many addresses . Now and then , Julia answered but always said she was too poor to afford a trip home . When Clara offered money for the fare , Julia said there were better uses for it . Liberty had been  | horn when Julia was with a group called What 's Coming near Oakland . There had been two pictures , one of Julia and Liberty when the child was about three , one of Liberty alone at seven or eight . Andy and Clara had never seen their granddaughter . School was to begin again . Clara met with the teachers . " Dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sharla , the fourth-grade teacher , asked , looking around at the other teachers . " Parents are complaining about the difficulty . " Clara followed her look . Others nodded in agreement . " I 've gotten complaints , too , " Clara said , " but I always have . Memory work is difficult , and the vocabulary is unusual , but memory is the forte of the young . Why not exploit that gift ? " " What nine-year-old understands Gray 's Elegy ' ? " Sharla was beginning the argument they had all come with for the last twenty years . " None , I think , " Clara said , " but there 's a feeling awakened by the rhythm and flow of the words . Slowly , meaning emerges , and one day a girl may look around at her situation and say to herself , ' I 'm wasting my sweetness on the desert air , ' and in those words , that idea , a wisdom is there for her , to use and draw on . " " I 'll admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iiiemory when I first came , " Marie , the third-grade teacher , said , and to a degree you convinced me , but things are changing . We do n't have the mandate to teach the way we did . We do n't have the authority to make our judgments accepted automati-cally . " " Rote learning is " ? Darren , the fifth-grade teacher , was being careful ? " out of fashion now . People think it stunts mental growth . Parents say it is n't creative . " Clara felt an emotion that had become annoyingly familiar in t he last years . It was an impatience and frustration that emerged as sorrow , not anger . There had been a time when she had waded into the familiar argument , proving , defending . But then the teachers themselves had all memorized the preamble to the Con-  | stitution , the Pledge of Allegiance , the words to " America , the Beautiful , " all four verses , and whatever poems and speeches their own teachers favored . The new generation 's teachers had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a defense of memorization in their schools . " Teach them how to think , " everyone said , as though memory had no bearing on thought . Sharla said , " Some fourth-graders like the poetry contests . They like the mastery of big poems and long words . " " Then it 's in the fifth and sixth grades that you are encountering criticism ? " " Yes , " Darren said . " All of the new people ask about what college will accept a Gold Flume education . From the early grades on , they are aiming their kids at eastern or western colleges and scared stiff that Gold Flume wo n't measure up . " " Recitation day , spelling and poetry contests , sound as passe to them as McGuffey 's , " Darren continued , " and they 're competitive . Parents think competition is okay in sports . They 're in a sweat to start a Little League . They 'll make their kids drill for hours catching baseballs or sinking baskets , but pull a drill in history or spelling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory work stick because I 'm a male teacher , but parents do n't really want it . We 've stopped being experts and have begun to be servants or , at best , baby-sitters , offering a product that parents vote on . " He looked levelly at Clara . " And I 've heard complaints about The Jail . " Clara had never called it The jail . Years ago she had marked off a space in her slowly shrinking office , where children sat who had been sent there for misbehavior . It was the children themselves who called it The Jail and ascribed great importance to it . " Parents complain that the kids are being publicly shamed , " Darren said . " Everyone who walks by can see who 's sitting there ? "  | " I do n't know how we can fix that , " Clara protested . " I often have to leave the office and I do n't want youngsters poking around in my desk . The public gaze keeps them honest . " " I know the kids like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do weave stories about The Jail . It 's the same as the haunted house . " " What haunted house ? " " You know , the place down by the tracks where the old lady cats children . " " The Tavistock house ? " " Yeah . There 's almost a body of myth grown up around it . I hear all kinds of stories , seasonal ones , some poetic and mystical , some funny , all terrifying , though . Old lady , big house  --  it 's made to order . Rattling chains , ghostly screams . " Chessie French , still on summer break , was helping Andy with his new computer . Clara stopped in one morning . " Did you ever hear stories about Mrs. Tavistock  --  that her house was haunted ? " Chessie grinned . " We started hearing those stories after Mr. Tavistock retired . There were lots of them . What 's funny is that t hose stories are the same ones I hear at college . Kids who have never set foot in Gold Flume tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the same . One is about children being captured and dressed to replace the dead children of the family , then killed themselves , of dead bodies embalmed and put around a dinner table . " She laughed . " It 's funny now , but when I was growing up , it was nightmare country . The first misunderstanding of words I can remember had to do with those stories . The kids heard the term serial killer and thought Old lady Tavistock gave stray children drugged oatmeal . "  | Chessie went back to school and Andy began looking for fulltime help . Although there were other surveyors in town now , Andy got most of the work because of his knowledge of the area . In November he went to a convention in Denver , partly to study the agreements of partnered men he met there . He called Clara the first night and talked about how surprised he was at the reactions of eagerness to his inquiries . Only a few years ago the suggestion of a partnership in Gold Flume would have drawn no interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I feel like a Hollywood director casting a movie . Where will it end ? "  | She laughed . " Have a good time down there and do n't cast any leading ladies . Winter 's come up here . The pipes at sch 1 froze and made a mess . Here the furnace man had to replace the widget-sprocket . I checked your office and you 've got another leak in the roof . The management company promised to see to it . This conversation would drive anyone into the arms of a convention groupie . " " Two days away and all this ? And Helene Singleton thinks small-town life is dull ! " " I miss you . They 've lengthened all the days since you left . " " Give my love to Sammy Horner . " Buster French 's cousin Sammy had been the school bus driver since he was eighteen . He was fifty now , driving the route every day and not drinking on the job . When Clara went out to talk to him at the school parking lot , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Sammy that the school administration was splitting the district . There would be three drivers . He asked if his two nephews Elvis and Johnny Ray could get the jobs . Clara wrote to Chessie , who said the two were all right . On Clara 's recommendation both were hired . They got along with Sammy and did well with the children . They knew the routes and seemed to like the challenge of driving the winter roads . Clara was pleased . The running of the school and administrative details took up so much of her day that the controversy about poetry projects , curriculum , and The Jail faded for a while . The halls were still lined with the biographies she asked each grade to write and post at waist level for the younger ones to read . But Clara was now and then aware of changes in the vocabulary and expression of the children , and of a tone at once more worldly and less knowledgeable . She still enjoyed sitting in on the classes for as long as she could , observing a discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it flavoring the days ? She had a persistent  | unease at what was there and gone , so subtly , at the edge of words . There was a certain incivility , a breach in some important element in the social contract . Or was there ? Cruelty had always been there , surely . Had there always been this guardedness , this jaded quality , this passivity ? The Frenches were gone , all at the new school in Bluebank . The Gulch children had disappeared and an entire class of the starving poor had dwindled away . Everyone now had heat and water inside the house and a flush toilet . No one ate stolen horse fodder in winter or came to school with the welts of chilblains or fainted with the illnesses that hunger exacerbated , but .. . But there was something smooth , passive , and arrogant in the manner of many of the children . They now said to teachers , " You have no right to touch me . " " This lesson is too hard  --  my father said I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces said , " I will do nothing I do n't agree to . The adult world is my adver-sary . " Their manners said , " No one defines anything for me . " They were less judgmental of physical deformities in one another . They did n't blind cats or tie cans to dogs ' tails to make them run in panic , but the thirst for learning Clara thought would bloom naturally in them when they were all adequately fed and clothed had not appeared . Fewer parents came to school nights or other town events . The engineers ' wives had jobs and worked at the new college extension in Aureole , and now it was difficult to find parents to set up and run the school trips . The six or seven programs Clara usually brought in during the year had no parental help . Yet the houses glowed blue with TV until midnight . The snows came one after the other and the Christmas holidays were a record in the town . Every hotel and motel was filled , and the townspeople made money renting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three new workers and hired an office manager . Andy said that Hugh Singleton was awed by his wife . " He thought she would have a hobby designing , something to do  | in the afternoons , which , if she was lucky , would pay for itself , and for the fabric she bought , and even for the hair salon and cosmetics bill , which is close to a small country 's GNP . Instead , here she is , making double what he is , and pretty soon she 'll be paying more income tax than he earns . " " Can he take that ? " " He 's getting ready to . " " Could you ? " " I did , you remember , starting out . It was five years before I came close to the salary you got as teacher-principal of a oneroom school . " " But you had every expectation of overtaking me  --  did it bother you ? " " I 'll have to admit , it did . There was a time , about three years into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I thought I should  --  you 'd gotten a raise , I remember , and we were paying John Steadman and you were pregnant with Joseph . It was n't suffering  --  but I did feel a pang now and then . Hugh 's situation is different . He 'll never make a tenth of what she does if she keeps on going . Right now , she could buy him out and go to Paris if she wanted to . Although this will turn out to have been a good move for her  --  launching a career with skiwear  --  in five years , she 'll be gone . " " I 'll be retired by then , and I 'll be able to go across the street and see her off . A bouquet of mountain flowers would be nice , do n't you think ? Devil 's paintbrush ? " " Clara Percival ... shame ! " The February thaw came early that year . The snow on the mountains went gritty for a week or two and the town snow turned gray with decaying mounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drops of temperature . Black ice gave at the edges but it was still iron-hard in all the low places , and the morning 's cold wind rattled the teeth like loose windows .  | Sammy had the south bus run . The north-of-town runs were given to Johnny Ray . Clara knew he was annoyed by children being tardy and keeping him waiting , and she had written notes home to some of the Flume Heights parents because of it . The day 's classes had already begun when the school secretary , Alvia Dener , put her head in at the principal 's office . " Carl Singleton 's out here ? " " What 's up ? " " You 'd better come out and see . " Helene 's son Carl was now in the third grade , a shy dreamer of a boy , still front-tooth-less from the second grade when all smiles were gapped like losing prizefighters ' . He was given to long silences from which explosions of words burst out in rapid speech , drying up to nothing at the first request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear children have at being singled out . Clara 's eye passed down the plaid flannel shirt and corduroy pants . " Carl  --  where are your shoes and socks ? " His eyes went brimming . " Did n't you come to school with them ? " A shake of the head . " Did n't Mr. French notice you had no shoes ? " Another shake . " Alvia , " Clara said , " call Helene Singleton and ask her to come over here with some shoes and socks for Carl . " She got up and went to the lost-and-found box and got two mittens and put them on Carl 's feet . Alvia called the Singletons ' home . There was no answer . " Call the factory , " Clara said . The woman came billowing into the school , her eyes wide with fear , looking past them , exactly like her son . " Where 's Carl ? What 's happened ? " " Did n't Mrs. Dener tell you over the phone ? " " Where 's my son ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came into the outer office where Carl was sitting next to Alvia 's desk . " Carl ? " She did n't notice the mittens on his feet . " Helene , " Clara began , " did n't you get Alvia 's message ? "  | " I was at the atelier . One of the workers answered the phone . She said it was about Carl and I came right over . " Helene was staring at the little boy , who was now weeping with anxiety and shame . " What is it ? What 's the matter ? " Her voice was strident in the silence of the room . " He did n't wear his shoes and socks to school , " Clara said . Helene exploded . " How could you have been so stupid ! I thought he had been hurt . I rushed up here thinking God knows what . You could have told me over the phone . " " We tried , Mrs. Dener tried . " " When I came in ? " " We thought you knew ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " There was no answer , " Alvia said , beginning to lose her timidity in annoyance . " She might have been in the basement , or busy . Why did n't you wait and call again ? " Helene demanded . Clara could see the darkening in Alvia 's face . " Stupid , " Helene muttered , " just stupid . Now I 'll have to call her myself and get her to come over here ? " Alvia opened her mouth to say something . Clara said quickly , " I 'm sure you 're relieved that Carl is all right . Things like this happen all the time . Youngsters hurry to school and coats , lunches , books get left behind ? " Helene was dialing the phone . She spoke briefly and hung up . " The housekeeper is coming over with the necessary cloth-ing , " she said frostily , and left . Behind her , Clara heard Alvia mutter , " You 're very welcome , I 'm sure . " " It 's only her embarrassment . Do n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be spoken to like that , " Alvia said . " That woman is going to apologize . " " Let it go , Alvia  --  she 's so embarrassed she wants to disappear in a hole . "  | " That , " Alvin said , " might be arranged . " When Clara got home that evening Andy was already there . " The deed has been done , " he said , " and tonight Mr. and Mrs. John Isabella are coming up for celebratory drinks . Break out the beluga and the beakers of champagne . I have an associate . " They were nice people , the Isabellas , but had no children , which was why Clara had n't met them . The evening got merry . Clara made a party dinner and everyone ate well . The Isabellas had brought champagne and after dinner they all sat back and found themselves swapping town legends . The Isabellas knew some of the French stories , even though the French compound was gone . By now the tales had a mythic quality and were told with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its substation , the officers were called French chauffeurs . Buster French got drunk and fell off the railroad trestle into its stagnant pond  --  French dip . " Not Buster , Kester , " Clara said , and then she laughed , but both she and Andy had the awareness that these tales were n't invested for the new tellers with a knowledge of the Frenches as real people . Clara told about Mrs. Kenner , who , if she liked you , would knit you a pancake hat like the one Erasmus wore , or socks with knots in the toes that could cripple you ; about Evelyn Matske , whose stroke made her aphasic except when singing and swearing , which she kept up until her death . " Did you hear the one about Andy Percival , who was running for the fire truck on a false alarm , tore his coat on the closing door , fell , and sprained his ankle ? " Denise Isabella unfolded the lurid tale about the old recluse in the haunted house . " Of course I 've never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clara said , " but I think she 'd be horrified by the stories because they make her sound low class  --  common , and she could n't stand that . The truth is that she 's stuck in that house missing people I miss also . "  | " Were there children ? " " There was a son and a daughter . The daughter is a successful sculptor in Taos , but never visits Gold Flume . The son died as an afterthought to the Korean War . " " I hate coming in in the middle of the story , " Denise said . " When the Tavistock house was built , " Clara was enjoying her tale , " Gold Flume , Callan , Bluebank and Granite and Aureole were all big towns . This valley had a population of three hundred and fifty thousand , and almost as many millionaires as Central City . When the Tavistocks came , we all thought the mining would start everything up again . When I came , Gold Flume had about fifty people living in it , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " ? and land prices are out of sight , " John Isabella said . " We ca n't afford anything near town , but we just got five acres near Callan and we 're going to put a house trailer on it until we can build . It 's halfway up Wildcat Mountain " Near the Boda place ? " " Cyril Boda sold us the land ? " " It was funny , " Denise said . " He did n't say two words to us . His wife did all the talking . " " Cyril 's not much for talk , " Clara said , and began to tell stories about him . His brother , Sulo , had died in 1966 under a tractor he 'd been fixing , and at the funeral she had gone over and drawn Cyril 's attention to the grave of Peter Tavistock , Cyril 's only school friend . It was on the other side of the graveyard but visible from where they stood . " I had once put a wild rosebush there and it had been torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for its big stone , but then someone had come and put three large wild rosebushes in the waste space behind the grave . The bushes had grown up , protected by the stone , and they made a kind of bower all around the untended grave . I told Cyril I thought I knew who had done that . He looked at me with  | that stare of his and said , I saw how things was when I came to bury my dad . Peter was my friend , ' and that was all . " " You 'll have to visit when we get the house built , then , " Denise said . " Nice people , " Andy declared when they had gone . " New friends , maybe . " As Clara lay in bed that night , her mind drifted back to Carl Singleton standing in the office without his shoes and socks , to Helene 's anger , to Alvia 's set face . Alvia Dener was now dealing with a lot of parental resentment . She had been a school secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect in a town like Gold Flume . Many of the new people treated her like a low-paid clerk or office underling . Alvia sometimes expressed the feeling that she and Clara stood against these new people and their demands . Look at that lawsuit  --  it was true that the McLeans had n't carried it out , but who can expect that children wo n't fall , get sick , lose things , fight during a day ? And Alvia knew even more about students ' private and home affairs than Clara or their teachers did . She had had to learn complete discretion , but now she was angry and felt embattled , at fault because she had n't headed off the unreasonable mother . Should she laugh with Sammy at the bus stop or complain at the altar guild or in the robing room at choir before church , the town would have the story in an hour wafted all along its older streets . The thing would take air then and blow full like washline sheets in the wind . It would get funnier , wilder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when it got funny enough , it could cross the barriers between the old Gold Flume and the new . Helene Singleton would hear it and assume Clara had spread it . " I 've got to tell Johnny Ray and Elvis to check the children for clothing , and to send them back home if they do n't have coats on or shoes and socks . I 've got to tell Alvia not to mention  --  not to say ? " And then Clara was asleep .  | The new development south of town was now so large that its residents petitioned the highway department to build another exit off the interstate . During its construction , the engineers were forced to divert all the adventitious creeks and runnels of the Ute hack into the mother river , and the oldest of these , Selevan Creek , had been rediverted just down from the southern edge of the old French encampment . Alvia came into the office early and stood before Clara at her desk . " Do you know what 's going on at Selevan Creek ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " No , " Clara said , " but there 's something I need to discuss with you . " " They 're going to try to keep it out of the paper , " Alvia said , having launched herself , " because there 's going to be more . They 're going to dig down to bedrock right there and down creek all the way to the old fishing rock . " Clara knew when she was beaten . " What 's this all about ? " In the diversion of the creek , Alvia said , the skeletons of three tiny bodies had been revealed . Two of them had been fetuses , one had been fully formed , and the doctor said it might have weighed as much as nine pounds . The little bone baskets hung on rocks in the creek bed , sketchy as scrimshaw . " Frenches , " Clara murmured . " No , " Alvia persisted , " the Frenches had all their babies , but did n't you know three of the older ones in that family were granny women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the girls and women and thrown them into that creek . The sheriff 's going to Frenches ' to question them today , but they 'll get out of it . They 'll claim ignorance , and how can anyone prove anything ? Half the town 's at the creek now , digging down to see what else there is .... " Clara had n't known that the French women did abortions . No wonder Frances was bitter and thought the Town people were hypocrites . During the day , the digging revealed six more skeletons , some of them almost full-term babies . Over the following weeks two camps of opinion formed . One said the bodies were from the Frenches , another said that they had come from far upstream where they might have been buried and that the bones were from some old family graveyard and had washed down to that stagnant bend below the compound . The Town people could bear pain , sorrow , poverty , even tragedy , Clara thought , but not the ugly banality of what they did in secret . Theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring up in the next county . And was n't there some-  | thing mystical , symbolic , about the disposition of those lacy little hones ? people asked . Had n't Clara seen how the bones were lying when they were found and how they lay in relation to the ones that had been unearthed earlier ? " Do n't you tell me small-town people are lacking in imagi-nation ! " Andy mused as they compared stories at dinner . " There 's more deep fiction coming out of that firehouse than out of TV in a week . " He put on what he fancied was a Gulch accent . " I tell you it makes me proud to have raised up chirren in sich a rich envirement . " " Not funny , " Clara said . " Gold Flume 's chirren will be dreaming about this , having nightmares . Those little bones are closer to their size than ours . A kindergarten child or first-grader can easily picture his own little corpse down there in the water . " Two days later a heavy snow fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold followed it . Pipes froze and burst all over town . Power was off , car batteries defeated . Clara closed the school and for three days everyone was sent backward into Gold Flume 's past , the wood-burning past , kerosene and candles and thunder mugs and water settled out from melting snow . Clara heard the stories : God 's anger , the atom bomb , the Russians seeding snow clouds with sodium iodide . She thought of the barren prescription , " Teach them how to think , " and muttered , " If I teach them how to think , I 'll be alienating them from their parents . " God , Russians , and atomic power relented , and the town thawed sufficiently for school to begin again . Soon the skiers were back decorating the slopes and filling the saloons . " We have to steal a march on reality , " Clara said . " We 've had Selevan Creek and we 've had the cold snap . Next week there 's an eclipse , and we teach it before someone ties all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . " She was eating lunch in the teachers ' room . " Let 's declare an Eclipse Day , study it , read Mark Twain 's account in A Connecticut Yankee , and trace all the places the sun will eclipse  --  it would have  | to be on a line , would n't it ? " She sensed unwillingness in their silence , heads down . " What 's the matter ? " " These breaks in routine take more than they give , " Sharla said , " and the children do n't have an idea of the world yet , mine do n't , so all the lines and talk would n't mean much . The parents would n't like it because I 'd have to make up the day 's lesson , somehow , and that would mean homework . " " And what if it does ? " " Only a quarter of the children do the assignment , any home assignment . Parents get angry , kids get resentful , and it just is n't worth it . I do n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher to teacher . Two of them only shrugged . " This is an eclipse , a total eclipse , " she insisted . " We may never get one of those again in our lives . " " And what if it 's overcast or cloudy ? " Sharla said . " They 'll feel it as a betrayal . Their ordinary lives are too shaky  --  with moves , divorces , custody problems . A quarter of my class is n't living in the same place with the same family it was three years ago , and I 've just got Claude Sargent calmed down . He had three tantrums last week . Claude ca n't take changes and we 're behind in the curriculum already . " " Claude 's problems are hard on everyone , but this is an eclipse ! " Clara said . She said it into their bored faces . The unapproachable moon had been reached , walked on , and was now passe . The teachers had already informed Clara there was n't much interest in outer space , and the order sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploration lay on her desk . With such a response , she could n't justify filling it in and she could n't bear to throw it away . The mountain spring , still half winter , lay its equivocating hand on the town . The snow drew away , revealing last Novem-ber 's lost sock , blown newspaper , and a dead bird or two the cats had missed . There would be snows through May , but now Clara  | yearned for soft winds wandering like tourists through the town , bearing the ferny , mulchy smell of soil swelling with spring beauty and wild chive . If only the winter 's end would come without the wet , heavy snows and the mud ! The teachers had begun to talk about the spring sales . " Everything in Gold Flume is overpriced , " Marie said . " I 'm waiting until school 's out to get the discounted winter stuff , whatever 's left . " " Nini 's got a sale . " " Too rich for me , " Betty said . Clara looked over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skied . " " I do , a little , but Nini has more than skiwear now . It 's not a full line , but there are blouses and things . There are hats , too ? it made me think maybe I 'd look better in a hat .... " After school , Clara walked down into town feeling excited and slightly wicked . For a year or so there had been time only for quick errands . Today she looked in windows and went up and down streets , random as a tourist . Two blocks off Main Street a big new deli and bakery had gone up , and a florist shop and beauty parlor were now in the old ski area building . She went down by the depot , now a fancy restaurant , and across the bridge . She had imagined something like a row of shops in the cleared space of the Frenches ' compound . What she saw was a new street , parking , shops , a background of foliage , but nothing remaining of the terrain that had been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut away to make the street level . A new , terraced earthworks had been built up and the shopping street lay entirely separated from the Tavistock house , banked off by a hill . Clara went slowly down the street , shop by shop . There was a travel agency , a gift store , a boutique selling underwear and lingerie , a children 's store , and then the place that featured Nini.  | Helene 's things were only part of its window display , but there was no mistaking them . The front had two windows . In the first were the ordinary blouses , skirts , and dresses . In the second stood a mannequin posed in full ski outfit , of bright royal blue on its top , then shading through the blues : electric , cerulean , French , powder , lighter and lighter to a baby blue so light that it was almost white . The figure of the skier seemed to float , and there was a special emphasis on the lines of the lower back and behind . The look was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ca n't keep these in stock , Clara thought , and went into the store . A few weeks before , Andy had surprised Clara as she was looking dubiously into the mirror . " Do you like what you see ? " he asked . " No . I 've gotten thick and wrinkled . " " Why not go downtown and get yourself something with bows and polka dots ? We 've had a good year . We own the house and the car . If you see something that will set my pulses racing and drive me mad with desire , mortgage the house and buy it . " " Buy it and never count the cost ? " Clara had laughed and forgotten . But now , she stared at the price tag  --  seven hundred and fifty dollars . And the sportswear  --  blouses and tops mostly  --  had price tags that made Clara wonder if she were reading them correctly . Still , she thought , she might buy one blouse , one special blouse  --  that light green one . She went over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one down , and walked over to the mirror . Its color brought out a delicate tone in her face and harmonized with her hair , the gray looking whiter . Her eyes now had a pure green color instead of being nondescript . She took in her breath . But the style  --  it was all sleeve and front fall . This blouse , these clothes , had been made for other lives than hers , younger ones , and with no children 's reaching hands , no fussy cookstoves  | or dishes of spaghetti or need to wash out chalk dust . Still , if that color ever showed up again , that delicate green . . . where would she ever find such a color in such a fabric ? Buy this blouse ? To wear with what ? To wear to what ? She hung it back on its hook . Then she wandered slowly through the display , idling a little , sad but relieved of the burden of choice . There was a little L-t urn , and behind it she heard women 's voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ski area mothers standing together : Rosalie Treece , Mrs. Keller , Mrs. Deaton , and Molly Sargent , Claude Sargent 's mother . It had taken some time to learn their names , except for Mrs. Sargent , whose son 's problems had made her a regular at school . She stood a moment , getting them right . There was something familiar about the group  --  she had seen it before , just the way these four had placed themselves . She moved out around the displays and came toward the women , and except for Mrs. Sargent , they greeted her without recognition . She was , out of her context of school , simply a local , a Flumer . The working jacket covering her dress did n't help any . There was a pause in their talk and then laughter . They had finally placed her . So this was how the Frenches felt in town . No wonder they stayed away and sent the kids for what they needed , and why they never ambled the streets or looked in the store windows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see familiar faces . The ordinary daily sounds came and went , greetings and small talk , and it seemed to Clara that she had n't heard it in this way before , as a defense against the loneliness of a separated life . In her absentmindedness , she turned the wrong way and started to go up the bank building 's stairs to Andy 's office , but the office had n't been there for years and she stopped with a feeling of being caught out at something . As she continued up the street to where the office now was , Clara remembered where she had seen the group of women  | standing in the same way . It had been at a parents ' group social moment . As she looked at the group in her mind 's eye , something was obvious that had not been so before . Town and Ranch people and ski area people had always been separate socially . What was new was that the groups were standing far apart from each other , two separate bodies . A newcomer would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . She had n't realized how rigid that separation had been . When had people stopped talking across the groups , finding middle ground , making compromises ? Clara had a feeling of helplessness and that reminded her of her age . She was an old , forgetful woman , who had lost something she cherished without knowing how or when it had gone . Andy was out of the office and John Isabella was busy . Clara walked the two miles home , trying to banish a gnawing anxiety and a sorrow that made her shiver . " It is n't me they hate , but Gold Flume ! " she protested to Andy that night . " It makes them want more than any school can give . " " I 'm surprised the teachers voted you down on Eclipse Day , " Andy said , " but that reminds me . I stopped in at Doe 's office and got that bunch of old X rays you wanted . At least the kids will have something to look through if the sun does its job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " In the old days we would have said just that , " Clara said , and then shut her mouth on the words . She had sworn to stop sifting the tailings of the past for its forgotten treasure . The level of the children 's chosen poetry had gone down . The length had halved because no one praised the activity or took for granted that a child could learn all of a Keats ode or Gray 's " Elegy . " Every time she witnessed the falling-off , she found herself beginning , " We used to ? " and had to amputate the words . " Eclipse Day has been called , " Clara said , " but Raptor Day will come . It 's going to be the Wednesday after next . Can you come ? "  | " What is it ? " " I 'm inviting the town , anyone who wants to come . This has been in the works for two years . " " What 's the attraction ? " " Talks about raptor birds , yes . Pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birds themselves : eagles will be there , and falcons , owls , hawks , trained and wild , right before us , close up . " Clara 's eyes were shining . " They did n't want to come all this way , the raptor people . I had to make it worth their while  --  to get the other valley schools involved and to get the raptor people invited to two nights ' lodging and food . Still , it has happened . I will look into that eagle 's swiveling eye and hear its wingfeathers snap like a fan . " Andy was looking at Clara . She was almost an old woman , but sometimes he saw her pull out a sudden radiant beauty from somewhere and put it on , and it fit smooth as her own flesh and it lay there as naturally on her old woman 's face as though it had always been there and always would be . Through the next week Clara paid particular attention to the weather . March was a heavy snow month , but weeks might go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passes and roads , the raptor people would n't be able to get through , and they would n't travel iii had weather . " When you invite folks , " Alvia said as Clara peered at the clouds coining and going over Gold Flume Mountain , " you suddenly become responsible for their trips  --  the odd storm , the food along the way , and the dead battery in their car . " " I will stand at the door and I will say : Welcome to Gold Flume School , Mr. Falcon , Miss Hawk , Senor Gavilan , Senora Zopilote , Madame la Chouette . Fly right this way .... ' " " Bird-crazy ! " Alvia snorted . " This job has driven her cuckoo . " " It 's rapture of the raptor . They 're coming  --  ca n't you hear t heir wings applauding ? "  | T he weather held , an ideal bright , cold weather , dry in the valley but with two or three inches of soft snow falling by night on the high slopes . The awe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rowdiest skiers , and they moved in that silence , almost tiptoe in the streets of Gold Flume . Such was thcc new snow at the end of March , so light it could be sent back into air with a whisper . Raptor Day came , and Clara stood at the school door and waited for the blue van the raptor people would be driving . Two boys were sent to the office for fighting . " Not today , " she said . " I have no time for stupidity today . " They went back to their roonis pride-wounded . Nine-thirty came and passed . Ten . Perhaps the  | van had met with an accident coming over the pass . Clara saw the cages on the road smashed , the birds crushed , and an aimless drift of feathers awakened in the wind of passing cars . Then at ten-thirty she saw it moving out of the traffic of ski buses and cars and coming toward the school up the road . " They 're here ! " she cried to Alvia behind her . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some elaborate procedure of unloading ? " " Good Lord ! " Alvia cried . " I 've never seen you as fussed as this . " " I never have been . I 've seen big birds up close twice in my life  --  one great horned owl and one falcon , and I never forgot it . " The van came to the school entrance and stopped . A young woman climbed down , looking very official in a khaki uniform . Clara went to her and they talked about unloading the birds . The woman was defensive about their lateness . She had also mistaken the Callan and Bluebank exits for Gold Flume 's , but she could n't resist Clara 's utter joy and was soon lost in it . " Wait till you see what we have  --  I was lucky to get our largest birds ? " She and her partner were soon unloading and setting up the cages and displays in the gym . " This is going to run into lunchtime , " Alvia said with a little irritation . " We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it runs past three ? " " Then everyone will be late . " " I 've had calls , four calls . " " Good , " Clara said , refusing to be drawn . " Tell whoever calls that we plan to start in an hour or so . " By the time the raptor people were ready , it was lunchtime . Then Clara called the children to come , class by class , to the gym , where the sixth grade had prepared things earlier that morning . Every time there 's a program , parents complained , the children have to waste school time putting up the chairs and taking them down
