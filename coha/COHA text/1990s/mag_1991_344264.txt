Perhaps nothing in Donald Kennedy 's distinguished career became him like the leaving of it . Last week the Stanford University president took a step that has become all too rare in modern American life : he resigned with grace and dignity under pressure . His departure , effective at the end of the coming academic year , is the outgrowth of the festering scandal in which the university has been accused of overbilling the Federal Government as much as $200 million for research expenses during the 1980s . But there was no smoking gun , no dramatic new revelation , no public ultimatum to prompt his surprise abdication after 11 years in office . Instead , as he explained at a valedictory press conference , " I 'm the chief executive officer of the institution , and , as has been said , you bear responsibility when you have that job . " <P> Responsibility has become a word almost un-American in its connotations . Japanese executives symbolically step down when the good name of their company becomes besmirched . But the American style is to gut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular ( " Mistakes were made " ) and equate resignation with personal culpability . Kennedy , to be sure , had become the personification of the Stanford scandal ; the university 's aggressive billing techniques had included calculating as research overhead such expenditures as the cost of sheets , flowers and antiques for the presidential residence . No one had accused Kennedy of personal gain or even knowledge about the accounting practices . Against this background , there was something admirable about Kennedy 's conceding in his letter to the trustees , " It is very difficult , I have concluded , for a person identified with a problem to be the spokesman for its solution . " <P> Until recently , Kennedy 's style had been stiff-necked in the extreme . So far , Stanford has offered to return $1.35 million to the government . Kennedy scoffed at resignation in interviews during Stanford 's spring commencement . But six weeks of consultations and soul-searching convinced him of the folly of such a stubborn posture . As David Hamburg , a Stanford trustee and president of the Carnegie Corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of symbol of the troubles , he 'd better step aside , even though he loved the position and the university . " <P> These days , perhaps only a masochist can fully enjoy the job of a university president . One of Kennedy 's most far-reaching achievements  --  broadening the content of the required Western Culture courses to be more inclusive of women and minority writers  --  became a lightning rod for conservative attacks . Stanford faces a $95 million deficit in its two-year budget , even if the university avoids being forced to make a major repayment to the government . Kennedy plans to spend the next year focusing on this financial crunch . Faced with austerity , faculty members have their own grievances , and some even complain of Kennedy 's emphasis on undergraduate education at the expense of research . William Spicer , a professor of electrical engineering , grumbles , " Don Kennedy has truly lost the confidence of the faculty , and that being - the case , everyone , including him , realized that it did n't make any sense to stay .
