<p> Truck driver Kevin Callan had left school at age 16 without any academic qualifications . But a relentless determination to prove he was innocent of a murder for which he had been convicted drove him to become expert on studies of the human brain . <p> After four years of study inside a prison cell , Mr. Callan forced Britain 's legal authorities to admit that supposedly expert prosecution testimony at his trial had been wrong and that he had not been responsible for the death of a four-year-old child . <p> On April 6 , 1995 , Callan walked from Britain 's Appeals Court a free man . He joined the ranks of a growing number of people wrongfully convicted by Britain 's legal system who have had to be released from prison following campaigns to establish their innocence . <p> The last few years have seen a series of such instances , forcing the government to set up an independent body to investigate miscarriages of justice . <p> Most of the instances have centered on people accused of terrorist acts on behalf of the Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Birmingham Six , " the " Maguire Seven , " and the " Guildford Four , " in which the accused were jailed for terrorist bombings , are perhaps the most notorious . They attracted huge publicity in Britain and around the world . Police evidence provided at their trials was later shown to be flawed . <p> Chris Mullin , a Labour party member of parliament who took a close and active interest in the Irish cases , says two key factors created the circumstances for injustices to occur . <p> " There was a highly charged political atmosphere , " Mr. Mullin says , " because there was widespread revulsion against terrorist acts , particularly those carried out on the British mainland , and this inevitably had an effect on how the judicial process operated . <p> " Also , at the time it was not widely appreciated by the public at large that police evidence was crucial in influencing the outcome of trials , " Mullin adds . " When the basis of that evidence was shown to be false or highly dubious , the cases had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in having champions such as Mullin acting on their behalf , whereas Callan had to rely on his own tenacity and courage in fighting for his freedom virtually single-handedly , and without the benefit of publicity in the early stages . <p> Michael Mansfield , Callan 's legal counsel , says that like the better-known Irish cases , Callan 's struggle exposed the " extraordinary reluctance " of the British authorities to concede that " terrible mistakes can be and are being made . There are obvious flaws in our justice system , and the Irish cases and that of Mr. Callan have served to expose them , " he says . <p> Callan 's long ordeal began on April 15 , 1991 when he was looking after Amanda , the infant daughter of his partner , Lesley Allman , in the home they shared in Manchester , England . <p> Amanda was severely handicapped and often fell over in the house . She had done so twice that day , the second time fatally . Miss Allman returned home to find Callan trying unsuccessfully to resuscitate the child . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the trial that followed , a key prosecution medical witness testified that the girl 's death had been caused by her being violently shaken . The witness said he could see no sign of external bruises consistent with any fall . <p> Despite testimony by Allman that he loved Amanda and had never harmed her , Callan was sentenced to life in prison . <p> There , certain of his innocence , he asked the prison librarian to supply him with books about the human brain . " I thought that if I could find out how the brain works , I could learn how Mandy had died , " he says . <p> Study was a new experience for Callan , but within eight weeks he had read a dozen books . <p> Soon he felt qualified to move beyond reading . He began writing to the books ' authors and to some of the experts quoted . <p> He sent a letter , for example , to Philip Wrightson , an expert in neuropathology in New Zealand . He opened a correspondence with Helen Whitwell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He requested post-mortem photographs of Amanda and asked the experts ' opinion on them . <p> When the replies began flowing in , they were startling : The specialists agreed that Amanda must have died from a fall . <p> Armed with evidence contradicting the prosecution testimony at his trial , he asked the Home Office to review his case . <p> At first his appeal was rejected . But Callan persisted . With his lawyer 's help , he managed to persuade the Crown Prosecution Service to commission its own study from a brain expert . For the prosecution , the result was devastating . <p> The testimony of its " expert " witness " left much to be desired , " says Michael Green , a professor in forensic pathology at Sheffield University . The witness 's view that death had been caused by shaking was " difficult to justify . " In the end , the prosecution had no option but to ask the Appeals Court to rehear the case . <p> Ordering Callan 's immediate release , the three presiding judges said the fresh evidence " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , they declared , " a matter of regret that the applicant should have been convicted in the first place . " <p> Mansfield says : " There is a cautionary tale here both for the lawyers and the courts . " <p> He is by no means alone in believing that the Callan case exposed grave weaknesses in Britain 's legal system . <p> Mullin is critical of what he calls the " sluggish reluctance " of the Home Office to refer cases to the Appeals Court , and of the court 's diffidence in hearing new evidence . <p> He notes that although up to 800 applications are submitted for review each year , only a tiny fraction ever get back into court . He also recalls that in July 1993 a government-appointed commission on criminal justice criticized the Home Office for using its power to refer cases too " restrictively . " <p> At the root of the problem Callan and other victims of miscarriages of justice have faced , Mullin says , is " a tendency by our legal establishment to put up obstacles to strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Largely thanks to blunders the courts made in the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four campaigns , and Home Office lethargy in responding to appeals , the government moved last February to set up an independent body to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice . <p> Instead of the Home Office handling requests for reviews , a Criminal Cases Review Commission will have power to recommend that cases be returned to the courts . <p> But the new system , which will begin to operate late this year , does not satisfy critics like Mullin and Mansfield . <p> Mullin criticizes the government for failing to give the new body its own team of investigators . Instead , investigations will be carried out by police . This , Mullin says , is to " build into the new system one of the central weaknesses of the old . " <p> Mansfield describes the creation of the new investigating commission as " a step in the right direction , " but adds that it does not alter the fact that if Callan had not been so incredibly dogged , he would probably still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial compensation from the government for wrongful imprisonment . <p> *Third in an occasional series .
