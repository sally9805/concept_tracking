What 's new is the emphasis that card issuers , recession-weary themselves , are placing on them . Holiday shopping was dismal last year . And analysts have predicted that October- December sales this year will decline as much as 1.5 percent nationally , 2.6 percent in Georgia and 3.6 percent in Atlanta . <p> With consumer polls indicating most shoppers do not expect to use credit to pay for gifts , " the push is on especially hard this year , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chicago-based newsletter. ; Plans to spend less <p> For instance , seven in 10 adults polled early in the shopping season by The Associated Press said they did not expect to use credit for gifts .
