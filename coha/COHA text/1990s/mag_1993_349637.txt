What could be more idyllic than a day at the beach , especially if you 're an overworked salaryman with little leisure time to spare ? But the weather can also be unpredictable , the waves petulant and uneven , the flotsam yucky . Now those who do n't want to risk a less than perfect holiday can frolic at the Seagaia complex in Miyazaki , on the Japanese island of Kyushu , 930 miles south of Tokyo . The ocean that surges and rolls within it , chlorinated and free of salt , has a clearly defined width of 462 ft. and washes a shoreline 280 ft. long , composed of 600 tons of crushed , polished pebbles , all under a 660-ft. retractable roof . The chirping of birds is filtered through a sound system and echoes in the air even as plastic palm trees flutter in a piped-in breeze . When it officially opens this week , 10,000 people at a time will be able to play in the temperature-controlled waters of this man-made beach . <P> Meanwhile , 440 yds. away is the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure domes , born of a 1992 decree that the industrious people of the islands must work harder at leisure , in order to make their country not only an economic superpower but also a seikatsu taikoku  --  a life-style superpower . The government has vowed to improve working conditions and cut hours in the office 9.5% by 1996 . The enforcement of leisure time , however , is likely to leave many Japanese puzzled . In a recent survey of Japanese , more than 40% said they would n't know what to do with themselves if they had a month-long vacation . Seagaia , like an enormous indoor ski slope just outside Tokyo that opened two weeks ago , plans to profit by showing them how easy it is to enjoy themselves . <P> The name Seagaia is a paradisiacal melding of the English word for ocean and the Greek word for earth . And the sea labors to be as close to the original as possible  --  if not better . A computer creates perfect tubular waves four or five times a day , manipulating 10 large vacuum pumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into surfable crests that allow expert hotdoggers to demonstrate their skills . <P> But visitors get more than water for their tickets ( $38 per adult during the peak May-October season ) . Seagaia also has the Bali Hai zone , where an artificial volcano explodes every 15 min. with a thundering boom and a plume of smoke . The inside of the volcano is open for viewing  --  and leads all who dare enter into the Dragon Sanctuary , where a skeletal creature is enshrined in light amid spooky music . Nearby is an adventure ride called Water Crash  --  a drip-dry , 5-minute introduction to white-water rafting . The rapids are projected onto a screen as the raft bucks on a pool of water . Visitors can also sample from the menus of 15 restaurants and peek into the computerized control room that operates the retractable dome  --  the largest in the world .
