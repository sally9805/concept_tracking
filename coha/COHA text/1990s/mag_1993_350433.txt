Friends expected Navy Lieut . ( J.G. ) Alton Lee Grizzard , 24 , to be an admiral one day . Last week he was shot four times : once in each leg , once in the abdomen and , finally , once in the head . Classmates worshipped Ensign Kerryn O'Neill , 21 , an honors student and a track star at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis . She was found not far from Grizzard , curled in a fetal position . She had been shot at close range in the back of the head . Like Grizzard and O'Neill , Ensign George P. Smith , 24 , was a midshipman at Annapolis and was due to report for duty as an engineer aboard the U.S.S. Salt Lake City , a nuclear attack submarine . He shot himself in the right temple with a 9-mm Ruger handgun after apparently using the same weapon to kill Grizzard and O'Neill . <P> The heart can be an enemy of promise , undoing even the most disciplined of lives  --  as the elite community of sailors based in Coronado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Neill had been fiances since her senior year at Annapolis . Two days before the murder , however , she broke off their engagement . Smith then sent a 13-page letter begging her to reconsider . They were seen arguing on Tuesday evening , just hours before the killing . She left that quarrel in tears . At about 1:45 a.m. , Smith reached O'Neill 's sixth-floor apartment at the bachelor officers ' quarters . He found Grizzard visiting O'Neill , exchanged angry words and then opened fire . Within seconds , all three were dead . <P> What remains is a trail of suddenly hollow accomplishments : Smith chosen " best all around " by his high school class ; Grizzard 's passing for 12 touchdowns in his last year at Annapolis ; O'Neill 's 12 varsity letters . And what did O'Neill and Smith break up over ? In the Los Angeles Times , Coronado police cited witnesses who said , " They had different ideas about their future . " Now there is no future .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
