Celestine Truxa was born in Salzburg on the eve of Metternich 's coronation as prince . According to the midwife , her mother split up the middle like a birch tree hit by lightning , managing to stay alive just long enough to see her daughter 's face lodged in the crook of her husband 's arm , eloquent of birth and glistening , before she died . <p> It 's unlikely she died content . Celestine 's father , Oswald Truxa , was a suspicious man by nature , though often thought credulous and kindly , due to his dull-witted expression and his enormous size . Almost seven feet tall , he could lift Celestine clear off the ground , whirling her like an angel above his head , even after she 'd passed her twelfth birthday and such activity was no longer deemed appropriate . " Can you see him , my little mousie ? " he would demand , as Celestine watched the upturned and politely noncommittal faces of the townspeople slide past , to be replaced by what she believed were the faces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salzach in globes of light . Around and around her father would spin her until , finally , she would tilt her neck back to see over the wall of rock called the Monchsberg , and up into the sky , which was , generally , bright blue . " The fiend 's arms are long , mousekin , but he wo n't get you . So long as there 's breath in this body , " Oswald Truxa would yell , " he will never lay a hand on you ! " Oswald Truxa was a revolutionist , and the fiend he had in mind was , of course , Metternich . <p> Always , in that first moment as she felt her feet leaving the ground , Celestine would experience a combination of fear and delight . It was so wonderful to see the world from the air ! But what if her father were to let go ? Even while she felt his big fingers gripping her waist , she worried whether it could happen that she 'd begin spinning too fast , wrenching loose , rising higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of a button , and she 'd find herself approaching the terrible face of God . For , the truth is , it was God to whom she thought her father was referring . Still , even from so high up , she could see the bottle-green heads of the ducks swimming on the Salzach , she could smell the sweet pomade her father used to make his hair lie flat . Soon , she knew , they 'd be sitting together on the riverbank , tossing crusts of stale bread to those same ducks . The ducks would quack , and her father would try to amuse her by quacking back . <p> When he was n't plotting the overthrow of the Holy Alliance , Oswald Truxa worked as an artisan , carving toys that eventually found their way into the nurseries of the aristocracy . He was not an imaginative man , but his paranoia made him attentive to detail , and so his creations were in great demand . On any summer day you might see an intricately carved white horse with eyes of lapis , drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the retreating figure of a boy or girl-the enemy 's plump , unblemished offspring . <p> Celestine adored these children , though her adoration was that of the bird on the wing for its bright reflection in the windowpane , she did n't understand the tremendous gulf between her life and theirs . After all , did n't she , too , own a circus wagon with gilt bars , out of which she could lift a tiger painted yellow and black ? Not to mention the sly dancer named Loona-Maroona , whose jointed legs spread to accommodate the back of a star-spangled elephant . Because they were presents from her father , Celestine tried not to notice how the elephant 's tusks were cracked off at the roots , how the dancer 's legs were comically short in proportion to her torso ; how the tiger 's gaping mouth was toothless . But by the time she was willing to admit to herself that her father 's presents were nothing more than those toys rejected by his more discerning patrons , it was too late . The habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected image with the light of religious significance . Celestine came to believe , then , in the perfection of innocence , towards which she strived as if it lay ahead of her , as if the flower moved , inexorably , from the dissolution of late summer back to the green , stirring heart of the bud . <p> It is no accident that such a young woman would have flourished in the very town where Paracelsus not only lived , pursuing his alchemical career , but where he also died of metal poisoning . Nor is it an accident that she would choose to sit at the foot of the statue the town fathers erected to his memory ; almost every after-noon she could be found seated primly on the convenient wrought-iron bench , her large hands folded , pale white , in her wide dark lap . And , whereas Oswald Truxa sought anonymity-together with a growing band of revolutionists he maintained a hideaway in the rocky outcroppings beyond town  --  Celestine craved such attentions as might come her way in the manner of mice , skittering through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideboard in the pantry a crumb of blue-veined cheese . <p> So it happened that one afternoon in late August a soldier came to sit beside her on the bench . The nighthawks were beginning to stir on their ledges , all at once , like the dark appendages of a huge , reviving organism , its mute intelligence visible in the manifold lights of its eyes . But whether those eyes were lit from within  --  the hausfrau rising on tiptoe to set a match to the wick  --  or whether it was the effect of the sun going down behind the Monchsberg , spilling its gold across all the windows of Salzburg , Celestine could n't tell . <p> The soldier was a slim man of indeterminate age , his bones sharp , prodding through folds of weather-darkened flesh . On his head he wore a cap with a beak-like visor , from under which his hair flew out in pale filaments ; his eyes were the shade of blue the whey assumes , dripping from the curd through the meshes of the basket . Celestine immediately understood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the whiteness of his hair might indicate age , or experience with terror , or merely an extremity of blondness . His uniform was a baked brown , deeply rucked and furrowed , like the banks of the river in seasons of drought . If he carried a weapon , she could n't see it . Was he a mercenary ? The single medal he wore pinned to his narrow chest was in the shape of a fish , and bore no resemblance to any token of bravery she 'd ever seen before . <p> Years had come and gone since the last time Celestine oscillated like the needle of a compass above her papa 's head . She was middle-aged  --  an old maid by the standards of the day  --  and already , at thirty-five , beginning to show signs of the deafness that would inform with heavy irony the final years of her life ; those years spent in service to the great musician Johannes Brahms , whose melancholy harmonies worked their way as if through cotton batting into her brain , where they suggested nothing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cohorts , through the thick plaster of her childhood bedroom wall , Still , her vision was excellent : indeed , Celestine had retained her ability to imagine the world from an elevated point of view . If she could see the Salzach 's flow darkening beneath its several bridges , could she also see all the way to Vienna , where revolutionary armies were converging , her own father among them ? Could she see Metternich as he watched his pretty maid sneak a sip of wine from the decanter ? Could she see him set his napkin fastidiously across his lap , only just considering flight to England ? <p> It was not unusual during such periods of upheaval to find soldiers in unfamiliar costume wandering around the streets of Salzburg . Still , there was something about this particular soldier that made Celestine uneasy , though it must be admitted he 'd in no way displayed any of the grosser characteristics associated with his kind . He sat at a respectful distance on the bench , staring toward the river with a look of comprehensive gloom ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticing , were , taken together , scarcely as wide as one of her own . <p> " It 's been a long time , " the soldier finally said , " since I have found myself in a landlocked place : ' His speech was polyglot , yet strangely elegant , as if not only had he spent his life traveling from country to country , but immersed himself in nomadic scholarship as well . " It is difficult to breathe in such places , is it not ? I have always thought that would account for the monstrous size of your countrymen 's rib cages " <p> " I 've lived here my whole life " Celestine said . <p> The soldier nodded his head and smiled thinly . " You 're Magyar , am I right ? The black eyes , the clavicles a man might grab and row like oars . Forgive me . I 've been among savages so long , I 've forgotten nice talk and sweet words . I am a man of honor , ' he asserted . " Do n't be afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , but she was lying . A shiver poured through her body , like a shiver through the hide of a ruminant , jerking loose flies . " Where are you from ? " she asked . <p> " If you mean where was I born , it was at the very tip of Jutland , in a town called Skagen . An ugly place . Still , children are perverse . They 'll love anything . And I was seduced with my first breath . It was the damp salt wind of the sea , which I 've been hungry for ever since . Among the Lapps , in the Finnmark , the flavor is more strongly of fish ; on the island of St. Kilda it 's like when you stick a cut finger in your mouth . In fact , I spent several years on that island , leading what people refer to as the monastic life . Which merely means I spent several years feeling bored in the presence of a higher being . Do I shock you ? " <p> " I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Celestine said . <p> " You 've probably never been forced to think about him twenty-four hours a day " the soldier said . " In any event , it was on St. Kilda where I happened to study the writings of the man standing above us . Which is why I ca n't help wondering whether you 've got some reason for sitting here . Or are you , like so many of your sex , without the curse of purpose ? " <p> No one had ever asked Celestine such a question before , and she realized  --  as she felt breaking in half , deep within her chest , a round smooth stone ; a stone such as she 'd found when she was a child , which her father cracked open with a hammer , revealing inside a turreted , crystalline city  --  that she was not an ordinary woman . She almost cried out , the pain was so sharp , her exhilaration so intense . " But I am cursed , " she said . " Only , it 's difficult to describe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to locate her heart among all those crystal buildings , " I watch other women walking with their children along the river and I ca n't imagine what it would be like . Would it make me happy to have a child ? " Celestine paused . She thought her heart was the size of a seed , but very beautiful . " It 's never seemed to me that it would , " she said . <p> " People in this country waste too much of their energy on procreation , ' the soldier said . " Paracelsus had the mind of the landlocked . It 's not surprising he came from such a place , where men spend their lives prying from the integral alp bits and pieces of this and that . Do you understand ? " <p> Celestine smiled . " But I 've heard it said that this very place where we 're sitting was once covered by the sea . That 's why there 's so much salt buried in the rock , and why little children picking cloudberries sometimes find the skeletons of whales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the soldier said , " a man will say ' I doubt ' when he means ' I believe . ' " He turned in a single , rigid motion to face her directly . <p> Celestine felt her fear of him close its hand around the little seed of her heart . He looked so much like one of her father 's clockwork toys that she found herself wondering at what moment , and by what invisible agency , the key had been twisted in the aperture . How carefully her father would lick the tip of his brush into a point , before painting in the pupils on a doll 's eyes ! The soldier 's eyes were terribly bright , and his pupils like the tips of pins . <p> " I doubt , " he said , " that you have ever known love . Maybe you 're biding your time , waiting for its arrival ? Maybe you think it is a singular event , just as Paracelsus thought God was a singular being , extruding primary matter the way a spider extrudes silk ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Celestine said . She watched the lamps being lit along the banks of the river , the flowers of light blooming on the river 's surface , like the lily-covered barges that would float there during the Feast of Corpus Christi . From far off came the sound of gunfire as , across the square , a young girl flung open a casement window and leaned far out , her face a white , featureless disk , her arms extending , arbitrary , toward the sound . <p> " That 's what I 'd hoped you would say , " the soldier said . He stood up and took Celestine 's hands in his own . " It was only a matter of waiting " he said , drawing her up from the bench . For the first time , he looked surprised . She was so tall . <p> " My father " she said . " He 'll wonder where I am . " And then she shrugged . " But he never has before , " she added drily . " He 's a soldier , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soldier by a head , and she had to make a conscious effort to shorten her stride  --  the stride of a woman accustomed to walking by herself was they passed in silence along streets that became increasingly dark the farther they got from the center of town . The air , likewise , acquired intensity , filling in with the cold exhalation of stone . <p> " Now you must climb " the soldier at last said . Courtly , he held back the branches of a fir tree , and Celestine could feel the tree 's new growth stroke her cheek , its scent entering her nostrils and tunneling directly upward to a place behind her eyes , where it set off a strange , ocular jingling . Was it possible the path they climbed was composed of ants and bees ? Was it possible the soldier 's hand was a single star in an immense constellation she was about to enter ? At first , alder bushes clutched at her skirts ; in time , they were replaced by cushions of moss and veins of running water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer part of her body having become the brittle housing for a substance alternately fluent and concussive that she decided must be her spirit . The floor of the cave into which the soldier led her was spread with bedstraw , so with each step her sense of division grew stronger , unable as she was to reconcile the sweet , milky odor of a meadow with the moist and decomposing odor of this hole where he apparently made his home . <p> " It goes on forever , " he said , " and then it falls away . Come here ; ' he said softly , and Celestine surprised herself by moving toward him , toward that opening shaped like an O which he locked in place over her own lips , creating a chamber into which her spirit entered eagerly , to be lapped up little by little all night long . In the morning she was astonished to see how noiselessly the sex had retracted back into the soldier 's body ; he sat fully clothed at the mouth of the cave , boiling coffee over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , over Celestine 's thighs and belly and breasts , filling her with apprehension . <p> " The fighting 's started " the soldier told her . " Now we 'll find out if Paracelsus was right . " He pointed across the plain to where isolated puffs of smoke rose and dispersed , turning the pale blue sky a rosy brown , the precise color , Celestine thought , of the secret parts of her body . For the first time she noticed a rifle , leaning against the wall of the cave . " ' That which is above is one with that which is below , ' " the soldier said . " Or so Paracelsus wrote . Do you think that means God was corrupt when he made this world ? " <p> " No " Celestine said . " I think God acted out of innocence . " <p> The soldier lifted the rifle and squinted along the sight , aiming at a squirrel that ran  --  first partway up , and then partway down  --  the trunk of a stunted pine tree . Whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side , rotating it all around on the fluid joint of its neck , as if it wanted to be watching at the moment of its own death . " Do you love me ? " the soldier asked . <p> " I do n't know , ' Celestine said , and then she hesitated , wondering . " Yes " she said , finally , " I think I do . " <p> The soldier put the gun down , and stood up . " Then you should come here and kiss me goodbye , ' he said . " And when you think of me , it will be as if I 'd set out in a little boat across that sea of yours that used to cover this place , that filled all the hollows of this cave with its restless body . I expect I 'm about to die for a cause to which I 'm entirely indifferent . Do you think if I had shot that squirrel , God would have wept ? Still , I do n't think it would be a bad thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us who 're lived our lives where the world breaks apart into sand and salt and millions of drops of water know that the only immortality is conferred by the terrible human heart . " <p> In the years to come , even during the brief period of her marriage to a kindly and reliable man  --  a cheerful man , with whom she came to understand the thin boundary between happiness and boredom  --  Celestine nursed her memory of that night with the soldier , conjuring it by whatever means were available to her . Her pincushion , for instance , was filled with balsam fir needles ; she kept a collection of small stones in a bowl on her bedroom window-sill , and when she was alone she would sprinkle the stones with water , close her eyes , and inhale that strict and mineral odor . The smallest stone she occasionally sucked like a lozenge . <p> This was Celestine 's secret . Certainly her husband was n't aware of his wife 's private dreaming : her external manner had altered with the years , settling into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the truth is that even on their honeymoon , as she walked hand in hand with him along the shadowy esplanade of Gmunden , watching the swans ' necks curve like question marks above the Traunsee ; even as she sat with him in the hotel dining room , nibbling the swan-shaped vanilla ice cream , prodding loose the sliver of candied orange peel that was the beak with her spoon-even then , Celestine was remembering the soldier . <p> Eventually , she and her husband had two children  --  a boy and a girl  --  and though she knew it was n't possible , at certain moments Celestine thought she recognized in her daughter 's delicate bones the soldier 's likeness . She named the child Thule ; the little boy was called Max , after his father . <p> Oswald Truxa survived the revolutions of 1848 , and his last act was to make each of his grandchildren a special toy , in each case bearing out their specific instructions . Max requested a circus bear , large enough to ride ; Thule , despite her grandfather 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be more appropriate , insisted on a wooden man . Nor would she allow Oswald to give the figure moveable joints . " I want him all in one piece ; ' she said , " like a stick . " Every night she took the thing to bed with her . My Baunchie , she called it , and Celestine had seen her waving it around in the darkness of her room , speaking for it in a voice that sounded like a nail being drawn from a board . " No , Papa , " Thule would say , sitting bolt upright whenever her father tried to pry her fingers loose from the figure as she slept . He was convinced it would bruise the satiny skin of his daughter 's arms and neck , incapable of recognizing a strength of purpose greater than his own . <p> Within a single year , Celestine lost both her husband and her father . Each of the funerals took place on days of intense clarity : the skies were cloudless , the freshly dug earth almost black , the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tender ; on the other , concealed by thick patches of campion and rosebay . Thinking back , Celestine realized she could not remember which funeral was which . The priest 's words had been the same , the collection of mourners similarly garbed and solemn . On both occasions Max had cried as if his heart was breaking , and Celestine recalled how she 'd realized that his loss was the most complete-that he was now consigned to a life without advocacy , whereas Thule 's spirit appeared suddenly rampant . <p> They moved to Vienna , to a large apartment on the third floor of No. 4 , Karlsgasse . This was a middle-class residence in the style of the late Empire , the vestibule stained red and blue and yellow as light seeped in through the panes of the French windows . Returning home from school in the late afternoon , Thule liked to submerge herself in each color , assigning titles to her days : " Today I am a blue girl , ' she would announce to the world , and the world would respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Celestine would tuck her children in , and then give herself over to their separate bedtime rituals . Max liked stories involving a series of obstacles over which a hero  --  characterized by goodness of heart and simplicity of demeanor  --  triumphed . Because he allowed Celestine complete control over her narratives , in time she came to understand the relationship between plot and will . It was as if a metal armature insinuated itself within a spongy knot of details , like the beanstalk up which young Jack climbed , the smell of his blood thickening the atmosphere , clotting here and there into events . <p> Thule , on the other hand , insisted on complicity , and her passion was for the mutable . She always wanted the same story , but she would n't tolerate a predictable outcome . Originally , Celestine had been the storyteller , but little by little Thule took over , and Celestine could no longer remember the precise moment when the words ceased to come from her own mouth , and began to emerge from her daughter 's . Or was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . Thule had outgrown her habit of clutching the doll , but it remained propped on a chair in the corner , surveying the room with its bright , nutty eyes . Whatever its source , the story Celestine listened to , night after night , was the story the soldier had whispered into her ear , so long ago , as she lay curled on her side , each small movement releasing the frothy sweetness of the bedstraw . And , though in its unfolding the story was always different , it always started out the same way : <p> " Once upon a time , " Thule would begin , " there were four sisters who lived all alone at the tip-end of the universe , where the sea licked up the sand their house was built on a grain at a time . They had no mother , but they all remembered the day she left . The wind was blowing like crazy , and they could smell the breath of dead sailors in the air . As they watched they could see their mother running away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her arms were whirling around and around like windmills . " <p> " But , " Celestine would sometimes remind Thule , " do n't forget that Fortune was with them . Remember ? For while we all know that Fortune is a woman , she is definitely not , my heart 's darling , a mother . " <p> Because Thule took delight in the unexpected , she tolerated such interruptions , though she never really understood what her mother was talking about . " I know , " she would reply . " I just forgot to say that part . " And then she would go on to describe how the first sister liked to sit with her feet in the sea , watching them disappear , watching the sea draw with its many small hands a coverlet of sand over her toes . " It 's a gray day , " Thule would continue , " and the sky is like the big hood of a bell without a clapper . The first sister is perfectly happy sitting and listening to the sound the gulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilings . She 's thinking about what it 's like inside the house . She can see how the wind blows the door open , and how it picks up the edge of the lace tablecloth . Now the jelly jar has fallen over ! The water that was in it is dripping onto the floor , and the flowers are going to die ! This is a sad part , Mama . It 's sad because the first sister has forgotten to take care of the cat for weeks . There 's a little layer of sand all over the kitchen floor , and you can see the cat 's paw prints in it . " <p> " Beach plum and sedge , " Celestine would sometimes whisper , or , alternately , " Roses and lilies . " In the dark , small room , she could almost smell it : that odor of disintegration which she had come to associate with passion . Had Paracelsus been right ? Did creation really occur through corruption ? " But where is the cat ? " she would ask . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the first sister does n't know right from wrong . That 's just the way she is . The second sister is different . She 's a saint . Even though she 'll never get to prove it . And that 's what makes her so angry , is n't it , Mama ? " <p> " The second sister is the prettiest one , ' Celestine would answer , and then she would reach out to touch the soft crown of her daughter 's head , to feel the thin line of the part . " So pretty , " she would say . But Thule would shake her hand away , impatient . <p> " Yes , of course she is . You can just see her , standing on top of the highest dune , taking off that white dress with the pink cabbage roses she always wears ; she unpins her long braid , and her hair looks like honey when it falls over her shoulders . The next thing you know , she 's swimming ! Her arms fly up and down . Only we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She used to be in love with a boy named Walleroo , but she stopped loving him the day he showed her a chicken neck and said it was his father 's peepee . He was a bad boy , Mama , a very bad boy . But even so , she used to love him . " <p> " Love is boring , my sweetheart , " Celestine would say . " The second sister learned that the hard way . " <p> " She likes the hard way , Mama . Now all she wants to do is swim . If you were a seagull , you might think that she was a little boat ; you might think that her arms were oars . You might think that her lips would taste just like salt ; you might think that she is dreaming about nothing at all , or about flying right up out of the waves . She looks strong , does n't she , swimming so far from shore ? The only thing she 's wearing is a silver cross on a silver chain around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can feel the thick , secret bodies of the fish swimming alongside her . And the truth is , she is in love . She 's in love with Jesus Christ . " <p> Whenever Thule came to the part of the story about the third sister , she would close her eyes and hope that it would turn out differently . She believed that this part of the story was not subject to revision ; she believed that the third sister was most like herself . The third sister was drowning ! Why did n't anyone try to save her ? But she was too far out , too far away to be seen by the watchful gray eyes of the first sister , her favorite ; too small to catch the attention of the second sister , of whom she was afraid . Green above , blackish green around her , the ocean opened into vast hallways where , on her coral throne , Death sat , her gills widening and closing , her gaze cool and impartial . Death was Fortune 's sister . " Your sisters have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will tell you why . It is because you have always counted on them for everything . But now you will be my little girl , and I will dress you in flowing gowns of algae . At night you will visit your sisters , and they will finally learn how to weep . " <p> Thule liked to imagine that  --  the other sisters weeping . Until her mother took in her famous boarder  --  Johannes Brahms , fat and bearded , his hands customarily stuffed into his trouser pockets  --  she was a solitary child . Consequently , it gave her pleasure to think about how her absence might stir the hearts of others . But Celestine , as she 'd taken to reminding Thule and Max when they complained about the thin and unsatisfying soups she ladled out at suppertime , was having trouble making ends meet . And so , on an autumn day when the wind shuttled through the garden , rattling bracts and pods and dead leaves , Johannes Brahms moved into the set of large rooms at the front end of the apartment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to visit him in his library ; to sit opposite him in one of his two huge armchairs with flowered covers , and watch him make coffee . Some days he would let her play with his collection of tin soldiers , of which he had boxes and boxes . Other days he would ask her to join him at the piano , and then he would play music so beautiful she could see his fatness peel back and fall away , and , like a needle extracted from a pincushion , a slender young man would emerge  --  " pure as a diamond , soft as snow " which is how the violinist joachim described him , years earlier . His sense of humor , characterized as low-German by the biographers , eluded Thule . Once he sat and banged on the keyboard with his fists , explaining that he had done the impossible : written a sonata designed , once and for all , to exorcise the devil housed in the sounding board ; as Thule looked around , wide-eyed , to catch a glimpse of the retreating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does not do to believe everything an old man tells you , " he said . <p> In exchange for his music , Brahms insisted that Thule tell him stories . " Your mother says you , too , have a gift " he 'd explained the first time he made such a request . Initially , Thule stuck with the usual  --  Hansel and Gretel , Big Claus and Little Claus , Rapunzel-but after a while she became more daring . The first time she told Brahms about the four sisters , he inched forward to the edge of his chair , sitting hunched and attentive with his surprisingly long fingers splayed over his knees . He straightened his pince-nez . By now Thute was sixteen years old , and she 'd told the story hundreds of times . The sisters had gotten older . Sometimes they lived in cities ; the second sister occasionally took to dressing like a man ; once , the first sister lived in the far north , married to a goblin whose spirit assumed the shape of a white reindeer . They wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to combine them into a single woman , the third sister resisted synthesis , her decomposition into polished bone gradual and horrifying . <p> Thule suspected her mother would be angry if she knew her daughter was telling Brahms the story ; she suspected the story was supposed to be a secret between them . But with the passage of time , Celestine had changed . Her sense of the ironic , which had been leaking out of her over the years , was finally spent ; if she thought of the soldier at all  --  and it 's possible she 'd given up thinking of him completely  --  it was with the kind of surprised amusement we reserve for the follies of those younger than ourselves . <p> In fact , Celestine was turning into an old woman , and , as is the case with some old women , she chose ignorance over wisdom . Her head was now round and wooden , spinning this way and that like the globe in Brahms 's library , as she tried positioning her ear to catch the random phrase . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oma , and she laid sugar cookies in their outstretched hands as if distributing the host . <p> It 's important to remember that Celestine married late in life , and gave birth to her children even later . Now she regarded her daughter 's evolving womanhood with something akin to fear ; when she came into the bedroom to say goodnight , and to make sure Thule said her prayers , she resisted the girl 's attempts to draw her into the story . Whereas with Max , Celestine felt capable of displaying the full range of her talent for motherhood , it was all she could do to bring herself to stoop down and kiss Thule 's face , as if , in so doing , she might stir memory into motion and , with it , the flattening winds of erotic possibility . <p> You see , it was the original ending of the story , as told to her mother by the soldier , that Thule loved the best . She 'd only heard it once or twice , years and years ago , and she preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she imagined it nestled in folds of gray silk . Later , when she thought about it , she would n't know how Brahms had coaxed it out of her . Had he teased her ? That was , so often , his method of getting what he wanted . <p> The fourth sister was the only one with a name , and a life filled with domestic activity . Her name was Clara , and she was married to a brilliant and high-strung man , with whom she had six children . They lived in the same house  --  still small when viewed from the outside , but unaccountably spacious the minute you entered the door . From its tall , immaculate windows , you could look across the dunes all the way to the sea ; had she not been so preoccupied with her love for her family , Clara might have paid closer attention to her other sisters . She was the capable one ; she was the one who should have saved the third sister from drowning . But she really did n't have the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mend ; there were the peonies waiting to be cut and arranged ; there was company coming for dinner , and the goose needed basting . <p> " You 're right about that " Brahms said . " She was an excellent cook . But it was in Dusseldorf . The house was in Dusseldorf . " <p> Thule smiled then , and nodded . After all , was n't this her own technique , her own desire to alter and embroider ? " Clara was a happy woman . And the household was a musical one . No matter what time of the day or night a visitor might arrive , there would always be someone , somewhere , making music . But then a bad thing happened . A man arrived , and he was very handsome . " <p> " A young eagle , " Brahms muttered , setting a match to one of his long cigars . His fingers shook , and he seemed angry . " A young eagle flying over the alps . " <p> " Perhaps . Everyone in the family fell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them , too . Only , and this is the mysterious part , there was one of them he loved more than the others . The question is , which one was it ? " <p> At this point Brahms leaned over and pulled open the drawer of a cherry-wood escritoire . Thule could see that it was filled with hundreds of envelopes , tied into packets with blue ribbon . " It was wrong of you togo through my things , " Brahms said . <p> " But I would never do a thing like that , " Thule said . She was a little frightened ; the old man 's eyes had become protuberant and lubricious , as if at any moment they might pop from their sockets like the eyes of certain tiny dogs . " Never mind " he said . " Go on . You might as well finish . " <p> And so she did : The fourth sister 's husband began showing signs of madness . He could n't sleep ; in the mornings , before the sun came up , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go down to the beach . He 'd never done such things before the arrival of the handsome young visitor . And then one morning , he did n't come back . They all went out to search for him , but there was no sign of him anywhere . The first sister sat , as usual , at the water 's edge . " Look in a shell " she said , dreamily . " Look inside a cockle shell " The second sister , her body cupped in the rising palm of a wave , momentarily faced shore . " Pray to Jesus " she shouted . " The blood that pours from his wounds is the blood of all men . Catch it in a basin , and you will know your husband as if for the first time . " The third sister , of course , remained silent . She held Clara 's husband in her long white arms , and sang to him . <p> " Only that would mean she was one of the Lorelei , " Brahms said . " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in the Rhine , where they lure men to their death . " <p> " No , ' Thule insisted . " The third sister did n't lure him to anything . Actually , she did n't know what was happening when she saw him drifting toward her . His long hair flowed back from his forehead , and his expression was surprised , just like he 'd always known he 'd come to her someday . " <p> " He was mad . He was possessed by demons , " Brahms said . " It was a horrible thing to have to stand by and watch : a man of genius , a gentle man , who 'd spent too much of his time trying to hear music that would have been better left unheard . Music can be dangerous . When you listen to music , you can begin thinking it has its origins in a single source . You can begin thinking God has a human heart . " <p> " That which is above is one with that which is below " Thule said softly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Well , she was wron , " ' Brahms said . " Listen to me . I know the truth about what happened . It was the visitor who pushed Clara 's husband into the water . It was the end of February , and it seemed like the snow had been falling for months . Robert was worse . When he left the house , around noon , I followed him . I watched the crazy way he moved through the streets . Sometimes he would walk right into another person , and then he would back up for several paces , waving his arms around his ears , the way you do when you 've blundered into a nest of wasps . I loved him more than I 've ever loved any other person in this world . When he stopped walking , halfway across the bridge , and stood there leaning over the railing , I pushed him into the river . It was the Rhine , the broad silver Rhine , icing over at the edges . Only , he never found the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved him . He was freezing cold , and shaking , and it was my punishment to have to watch him rest in Clara 's arms , to have to watch him suck drops of wine from her fingertips . But he never recovered . A few months later he died in the sanatorium . Since then , I have grown heavier and heavier . And one day I 'll be too heavy for this earth to hold me , and then I 'll fall through the crust , and the sound I 'll make as I fall will be real music . Do you hear me ? Real music ! Not this sorry excuse for music , this stuff for which I 'm admired . " <p> Thule rose from her chair and came over to where the old man sat , cautiously , because she understood how sorrow abhors consolation , she stood behind him and wrapped her arms around his shoulders . It was getting late , she could hear cymbals releasing their widening circles of sound  --  her mother was getting out pots and pans , mixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then , as if it were a latent feature of the room , golden light was everywhere , just for an instant , before the sun fell into its slot , and the city of Vienna darkened . <p> " But there 's more " Thule whispered directly into the old man 's ear . " There 's a secret . What you do n't know is that it was Clara who told him to do it . Clara told him about her sisters , especially the third one . She told him how the third sister knew everything there was to know . She told him how the third sister was shapeless and formless , like the wind blowing off the sea . It was Clara who wanted her husband to fall in love with the third sister . " <p> " That 's idiotic " Brahms said . He wrenched his big shoulders from under Thule 's thin arms , and went to the piano . " If I do n't tell your mama about this , it 's only because I know you 're still very young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not so young , " Thule said . <p> " No ? " Brahms sat on the piano bench , and , as he continued to talk , his fingers began moving over the keys , releasing a curl of melody . " Well , perhaps you 're not , " he said . " Perhaps you 're old enough to understand when I tell you that some things are better left alone . " <p> Thule stood by the window , leaning her elbows on the sill . The stars were coming out , a star for each note the old man played . The melody was a sad one : small waves cupped the shore , their undersides a faint and luminous green , the exact color of the third sister 's eyes . I 'm going to die someday , Thule thought . From downstairs she could hear Max 's voice , shrill and excited , and her mama 's ponderous response . What would it be like to have ears that could n't pick up anything but the loudest noise ? If only her mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cells of her body would quicken , maybe then she would once again be able to listen . " I think , " Thule said , " you should tell my mama . I think when she brings you your supper tonight , you should tell her . " <p> But Brahms did n't answer . Though Thule did n't know it at the time , the heaviness to which he 'd alluded was already making it difficult for him to lift his hands from the keyboard . He was sinking , then , deeper and deeper into the music , he was beginning to compose the Vier Ernste Gesange  --  the four serious songs  --  at the first performance of which his admirers would be shocked by the change in his appearance . For even as he acquired greater density , he was shrinking . Celestine would rummage among his clothing while he slept , removing those striped trousers and flannel shirts he wore most often , she would stay up late taking in the seams , hoping to fool him into thinking he was still a big man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the middle of a conversation , his head would suddenly drop to his chest , and he would start to snore . <p> And then he received the letter from Joachim , telling him about Clara Schumann 's stroke . It was spring , and Brahms was sitting in the garden , his narrow torso sticking up like the tongue of a lily out of the bunched folds of a green lap robe , sunlight glinted off the large silver pin with which it was fastened . Thule heard about the letter as she helped her mother cut up vegetables for soup . Turnips , celeriac , potatoes  --  Brahms , during the last months of his life , would eat nothing but root vegetables , explaining that only things which grew underground contained the liquids vital to his art . <p> " No sooner had I handed the poor old man the letter , than he began to shake all over . I thought he was going to fly apart , he was shaking so har , " ' Celestine said . <p> " Is she still alive ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> Celestine picked up a little red potato , and scrubbed its skin away with a brush . " He wants to see you " she said . " I do n't know . He wants you to help him write a letter . I said I 'd be happy to help , but he insisted . You know how he gets . One minute he 's as sweet as a lamb , and the next thing you know , he 's hurling a book against the wall . " <p> Thule put down her knife and ran from the kitchen . She almost lost her balance on the stairs , grabbing the banister just in time . Still , despite her sense of urgency , she paused for a minute in the vestibule : sunlight filled the small room with color , but she realized that there was no color appropriate to her emotion . Nor did she have a name to give to that emotion . All she knew was that she felt like a lady 's long white glove and , at the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , ripping it apart . <p> Brahms sat sleeping in the garden . Insects landed briefly on his wrapped-up body , then took off , buzzing , their wings like gauze . The letter lay open on his lap . Thule could see that it was very short , and she thought about how we 're never told enough about the lives of those we love  --  that all we ever get is similar to the fly 's teasing weight on our bare skin , the threads of its legs rubbing together , its purpose beyond our imagining . She tried , delicately , to remove the letter without waking Brahms , but the minute she reached out her hand , his eyelids flew open : his eyes were yellow and dangerous . <p> " It 's your turn now , " he said . " Besides , you have a debt to pay . You heard those four songs . Do you think I 'm some kind of machine , waiting to turn your nasty ideas into music ? I am a very great man , and you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knows what it is like to be human . Why else do you think she turned herself into a stone ? " <p> " Mama said you wanted me to help you write a letter . " Thule sat down on a low wooden bench , where the old man 's shadow fell across her , making her cold . <p> " The fourth sister is dying " Brahms said . " Do you understand ? It 's not just the third sister who dies . And when the fourth sister is dead , then I 'll finally be free to look for Robert . Only the interference will continue , of that you may rest assured . The music will be everywhere . It will be impossible to get around it , at least as long as I 'm in this body . And afterward  --  that will be even more horrible . That will be the sustained note of the cello 's lowest string , which is the sound your mama 's chosen to shut out . But I think the truth is that 's the only sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Thule said . " I do n't understand why you 're so angry at me . " <p> " I 'm too old for explanations . Do you have a pen ? Your mother tells me your penmanship is excellent . I want this to be perfect . No blots . Nothing scratched out . Tell me if you think you ca n't do it . " <p> " But I can " Thule said . <p> The letter Brahms dictated on that afternoon in April never got sent . Word of Clara Schumann 's death came before the day was over : a terse message , delivered dispassionately by a young courier  --  a boy , really  --  who stood nervously scratching his stomach by the garden gate . Thule , however , watched to see where Brahms hid the letter , she knew that it lay folded at the bottom of the piles of envelopes in the drawer of the escritoire . <p> And so , rapidly now , the old man 's condition worsened . His friends would take him for carriage drives after he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Propped in place against a window , he would sniff up the warm air hungrily , from the basket lunch , he would remove , at most , a dry crust , and pick it to shreds as the carriage rolled past the Danube . But it was n't long before he ceased to be capable , even , of getting up and down the stairs . He remained in his bed , and requested that Celestine arrange across the counterpane many of his little tin soldiers , suggesting to her the appropriate formations for advance and retreat . Celestine shuddered to think that somewhere , among the many boxes filled with these miniature men , she might happen to remove a soldier whose uniform was dull brown , with a medal shaped like a fish pinned to its chest . She imagined how the little tin mouth would open in a slit . " My darling , " it would say , and how horrible it would be , she thought , to realize that even though the voice was no louder than a dropped pin , she 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third , just as the piano teacher Anton Door was peering , with the bald effrontery of the healthy , at Brahms 's head on the pillow , Brahms jerked : his two blue eyes glazed over , and two enormous tears slid down his cheeks . Would it have pleased him to know that his funeral procession filled the streets of Vienna ? Mourners came from all over Europe . Thule watched from the front windows of his apartment ; she did n't want to follow the six carriages laden with wreathes and flowers to the cemetery ; she did n't want to see the coffin being lowered into the ground . Instead  --  at the precise moment when Pastor Zimmerman was pronouncing his benediction , " Yea , saith the Spirit , that they may rest from their labors ; and their works do follow them "  --  she removed Brahms 's letter from its hiding place and took it to the garden , where she knew her mother was sitting in solitary confusion . Then she made her sit still while she read it to her . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure her mother could hear every word . " ' Here is a little riddle for you . Why did the aging musician grow a beard ? Do you know the answer ? If you said it was because he wanted to look like God , you 're wrong , along with many other people . Also , he did n't grow the beard to make himself appear more masculine , another common misconception . The aging musician grew a beard , my dear one , because he hoped it would muffle the sound of his heart . I am so weak . You would never recognize me . Joachim was here not long ago , and I could see the shock spread across his handsome gypsy face , even though he tried to cover it with his usual charm . I ca n't hold a pen ; that is why this letter is in an unfamiliar hand . It 's the work of Celestine 's daughter , who reminds me so much of little Julie : the same bony forehead , the same terrible stare . She had nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat , especially at breakfast , when he poured honey on his bread from that jar shaped like a hive . He could always kill me with a look . <p> " ' Here I am in Vienna . Every day I watch Celestine carry her yellow basket down the stairs , and I imagine the stairs rising toward me with each descending thump , and I feel my heart breaking under each thump of her big feet . And I think of him . ' " <p> Celestine looked up , surprised . " My feet are n't so big , ' she said . " Do you think of me as having unusually big feet ? " <p> Thule shook her head . " No , Mama , " she said . " But listen . The letter goes on . " It made her feel sad to see her mother throw a little wink in her direction  --  the same wink she 'd seen her throw other women as the pork butcher extolled the virtues of a particular sausage . " ' Celestine 's daughter ' " Thule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scribe , taking down every word , but she 's devouring what I say . She 's falling in love with him , too . She 's watching him get up from the table , watching him kiss Julie on her cheek , on the place Celestine informs me is the part of the trout preferred by kings . I think she can feel it , the gloss of honey on his lips , a few crumbs . Maybe she 's even figured out that the reason I chose a man 's voice to sing the songs of those four serious sisters of hers , is because it is his voice . I hope so . I hope so because it 's her fault that I 've lost him forever . Turned him into music and lost him . I resisted the impulse for so long . ' " <p> " What is he talking about ? " Celestine asked . " What four serious sisters ? " <p> " The ones in the story , " Thule said . " You know " <p> " But that was our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry . " It was my story . You did n't have any right to tell him my story " <p> " Please , Mama , " Thule said . " There 's just a little more . It 's important . " She stood , waiting , until Celestine nodded , indicating she should go on . " ' Clara , " Thule read , " ' stop feeling guilty . Robert 's death was an accident . All our lives are accidents . The story of the four sisters has no plot . Frankly , I do n't care if you do n't know what I 'm talking about . There 's some gibberish Celestine spouts , some words of a dead pharmacist , I think . Only he got it backward . That which is below is one with that which is below , is how he should have said it . It 's as simple as that . There is no God . Unless of course he 's hiding in that ridiculous tautology . In which case , it was God who pushed Robert into the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a lie . ' " <p> Celestine walked over to a rosebush and snapped off a dead blossom between her thumb and index finger . " You , of all people , should be aware of the fact that I 'm deaf as a post " she said . " So it should n't surprise you when I tell you I did n't hear a word . " <p> " But you interrupted me , " Thule pointed out . " When you interrupted me , you knew what I was saying . " <p> " A lucky guess , " Celestine said . Her arms hung at her sides , ending in the white knobs of her fists . " I did everything I could to make his last days comfortable , and this is how he repays me . " She sank heavily on the wooden bench , a pale old woman , shapeless , like a manatee . Daintily she lifted her hem above her ankles , and extended one foot into the sunlight . " This is the foot of a princess " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that night in the cave . Look ! " she said , taking off her shoe . " See how slim it is . Can you see how the spaces between the toes are filled with the thinnest webbing ? He kissed it . Here . And here " <p> In the garden , the bees hovered above the roses , from their little particulate bodies came a steady humming sound . The sea was very far away ; the soldier had been gone for a long time . On its hinges , the garden gate creaked loudly as , in a Viennese drawing room , three sisters sat drinking tea , while the fourth spread her skirts across the piano bench and began to play . The roses were many shades of red and pink ; Celestine looked at each of them in turn , their single notes emerging all at once in a chord , without measure . There was a smile on her face . <p> She was still smiling when Max threw open the second-story window and leaned out , shouting , " Mama ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be quiet now . We have to be very quiet . Shh " Thule said , " Mama 's listening . " <p> And so she was . Celestine Truxa sat in her garden listening to the stealthy approach of God . <p> <p> By KATHRYN DAVIS <p>
