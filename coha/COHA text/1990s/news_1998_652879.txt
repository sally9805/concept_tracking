<p> IN Manhattan , fear and greed are fueling the white-hot real estate market . Deals are falling apart at record levels . Bidding wars occur every day . And even brokers and lawyers are starting to urge caution . <p> " There 's a hysteria that 's kind of crept into the real estate community , " said Deborah Beck , executive director of the Real Estate Board of New York , a trade group that represents more than 1,000 Manhattan agents . " It 's not good for brokers , and it 's not good for buyers and sellers . " <p> In this incendiary market , deals fall apart twice as often as they did five years ago . These are deals that fail before the contract is signed and way before the buyer gets near a co-op board interview . <p> According to a study released this week by the Halstead Property Company in Manhattan , broken deals below 14th Street have skyrocketed from 16 percent in the sluggish 1992 market to 32 percent today ; uptown , they have gone from 10 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accepted offer to get more money elsewhere  --  and equally buyers ' cold feet , often the morning after . <p> Nick Brown , a Wall Street executive , promised himself he would buy his own apartment by the time he turned 30 . Right after he bid $230,000 on a one-bedroom on West 79th Street in January , the Dow dropped 220 points , only to recover quickly . But he was scared . When his agent tried to get him to bid $5,000 more , he backed out . Now , he says , similar apartments are $275,000  --  and he has more or less given up looking . <p> There seems to be no relief in sight  --  at least in Manhattan  --  from the glassy condominiums of Battery Park City to the pre-World War II palazzos along Park Avenue and the landmarked brownstones of Harlem . The reasons given for the whopping price increases  --  higher even than last year , a very good year  --  are many . Playing a big part are Wall Street bonuses to stockbrokers , Dow Jones windfalls to the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But in interviews , buyers and sellers also credit the newly desirable reputation of New York City  --  seedy is out , safety is in  --  for bringing young and old here to experience what they perceive as the new glitter and glow . When they arrive , many find renting an apartment prohibitively expensive : even with rising co-op and condo prices , many still argue it 's smarter ( and cheaper ) to buy than to rent . <p> Averaged together , sales prices below 96th Street for the first quarter of 1998 are up 20.7 percent over the same period last year , according to a survey to be released next week by the Corcoran Group . The market has risen 5 percent just since January , the company said , indicating that the steady upward trend continues . Other companies that are preparing their own market analyses report similar numbers . <p> Housing markets are strong throughout the region , brokers and statisticians alike say . " We do not have the Manhattan market madness , " said Joseph E. Mottola , chief executive of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're thinking of taking your sweet time , it means you have no chance of buying a house . " <p> In Brooklyn Heights , Christopher Thomas , who manages William B. May 's Brooklyn offices , complained of broken deals and of pressures similar to Manhattan 's . He said prices were rising so fast  --  perhaps 15 percent over last year  --  that he was worried about next year , " unless the stock market continues its epic climb , " Mr. Thomas added . <p> In this accelerating market , significantly more deals in Manhattan are falling apart now than in the late 1980 's , the last real estate boom , according to the Halstead company . While Halstead is the only one to have pinpointed the trend , other brokers do not question it . <p> " Deals fall apart because of cold feet and sticker shock , " said Barbara Corcoran , owner of a Manhattan brokerage . " In the heat of passion , people promise anything . " <p> Ms. Corcoran and Ms. Beck of the Real Estate Board attribute the splintering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of today 's buyers , they said , are first-timers and easily panicked . On the sellers ' side , Ms. Corcoran and Ms. Beck blame greed , plain and simple . <p> Disappointed buyers are found at every level  --  although few will talk publicly about their problems . According to Halstead 's report , prices for properties that are traditionally the toughest sells  --  studios  --  rose 34 percent over the last year . Small two bedrooms , another tough sell in the nadir of the market , were up 30 percent . Town house sales , which many thought peaked last year , were up 17 percent . <p> Even successful bidders complain about spiraling prices and the resulting free-for-all . Gonzalo Pardo de Zela , 39 , a lawyer , and his wife , Tatiana Pardo de Zela , 26 , first-time buyers , had bid $551,000 in a sealed-bid auction for a two-bedroom downtown condominium with an asking price of $599,000 . Then they were told they had lost out . Frantically , they considered bidding on a $750,000 apartment in the same building . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was way more than we could afford , " he said . <p> The Pardo de Zelas got lucky . The seller 's first choice for the $599,000 apartment reneged  --  typical in this market  --  and they had another chance . But they also had to agree to $34,000 more than their first bid . The closing is scheduled for this week . <p> The number of crashing deals has spawned another phenomenon : the rise of the backup offer . Brokers say today they see backup offers in at least 50 percent of all deals . <p> " A year ago , I would n't advise an agent to show an apartment where there was an accepted offer , " said Frederick W. Peters , president of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate . " Now , the only time I tell them not to show the property is when there are both an accepted offer and at least two backup offers . " <p> In all ranges of the market  --  from $125,000 studios to $3 million penthouses  --  many sellers , faced with a line of frenzied buyers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mortgage . They want buyers who are willing to forfeit their deposit ( should a mortgage not come through ) to grab the apartment of their dreams . <p> Until this year , agents agree , the vast majority of bids were contingent on the buyer 's getting financing . Neil Bader , chief executive of Skyscraper Mortgage , one of the city 's largest mortgage brokers , said that among his upper-end clients , 75 percent now sign contracts without having guaranteed mortgage financing . ( He estimated that 40 percent of midrange deals are signed without a mortgage fallback  --  the percentage was close to zero only a few years ago . ) Many of these bidders eventually obtain a mortgage , but they do n't make their offer contingent on it . <p> Making a bid on an apartment therefore often feels more like being caught in a cross-fire than in a friendly back-and-forth debate over prices . One apartment , at 22 East 88th Street , had 12 bids at the asking price  --  in four days . <p> " In times of rising markets the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen Raphael , himself . " <p> Lawrence Sicular , chief statistician at Brown Harris Stevens , a Manhattan real estate organization , said that with the rising prices a lot of buyers are " balancing on the edge , taking a risk . " <p> One couple fought the frenzy and took the risk . Neal and Jodi Elkin , who work at J. P. Morgan &; Company , thought they had secured a two-bedroom apartment on 72d Street near West End Avenue for about $450,000 . <p> The seller had even asked them to bring their chocolate Labrador retriever over to meet the neighbors and showed photographs of the dog to the board members , to make sure they did n't object . But " a week and a half later , we still did n't have the contract , and the ad was still in the paper , " Ms. Elkin , 32 , said . <p> The Elkins were nervous . Time was running out on their sublet . " Suddenly , he called and said he had an all-cash agreement from somebody else , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe in what they call the phantom bidders from Los Angeles , who had suposedly not even seen the apartment . ) <p> Mr. Elkin , 33 , said he felt violated . " I mean , we had a verbal agreement , " he said . " We 'd even shaken hands . " <p> Despite their doubts , the Elkins raised their bid by $15,000 and made it noncontingent on getting a mortgage . This time , they went to contract in 24 hours . <p> So what are buyers and sellers to do in today 's overheated market ? Mr. Raphael tells buyers to calm down and to prepare a detailed financial statement in advance  --  with a hard and fast bidding limit . No agreement is ironclad , he warns , until it is signed by both sides . <p> Clark P. Halstead , managing partner of Halstead , cautioned that buyers should ask agents to show them figures of recent apartment sales in similar buildings nearby to make sure they are not overpaying . <p> Nevertheless , " There 's this group that feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Ms. Beck said . Like novice gamblers who put a chip on every number , she said , some of these buyers will run around town placing bids on two , three and four apartments . <p> Because not all bidders are serious , Ms. Beck says she advises apartment hunters to make a backup offer if they really like an apartment . <p> " It 's like choosing a spouse , " she said . " You do n't do it because somebody is pressing you to or because you hear somebody else is engaged to the same person . " <p> The market , she said , is " kind of pushing people to act in a way they 'll later regret . "
