The importance of motor skill analysis in developing pedagogical competency has been confirmed by numerous authors and organizations ( Beveridge &; Gangstead , 1988 ; COPEC , 1992 ; Jewett &; Bain , 1985 ; NASPE , 1992 ; NASPE , 1995a ; NASPE , 1995b ; Pinheiro , 1994 ) . Observational and assessment skills are critical prerequisites for providing appropriate feedback and process-oriented assessment in physical education . Competency in skill analysis requires a knowledge of critical elements ( performance criteria ) and the ability to recognize discrepancies between a student 's performance and a correct model . Although students in teacher education programs have experienced success in developing the knowledge of what correct performance is , they have not been as successful in developing observational and assessment skills ( Pinheiro &; Simon , 1992 ; Stroot &; Oslin , 1993 ; Wilkinson , 1990 ) . <p> Past strategies for developing qualitative assessment skills in physical education teacher preparation programs have included providing students with a description of specific performance criteria and then allowing them to practice assessing individuals in a live setting . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) reciprocal teaching style ( c ) in that students receive a demonstration and identification of performance " cues " and then must observe and assess a peer . Many teacher educators have recognized that this step may be too large for undergraduate students . As others have noticed , such programs teach the concept of motor skill analysis but fall short of developing competencies in this area ( Walkley &; Kelly , 1989 ) . <p> In light of the documented need for improving undergraduate preparation in qualitative assessment skills , Pinheiro and Simon ( 1992 ) proposed an operational model of motor skill diagnosis that provides many applications for teacher education . The theory highlights the need for teaching strategies that include multiple opportunities to learn what to look for , which phase of the skill is crucial to performance , and what errors performers are likely to commit ( Pinheiro &; Simon , 1992 ) . Specifically , Pinheiro and Simon indicate that learners must develop a schema which allows them to focus on the relevant cues , thereby reducing the information processing load . <p> Results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1989 ; Wilkinson , 1990 ) in which the effects of visual training programs on qualitative skill analysis were investigated are encouraging and warrant further exploration of alternative teaching methods . The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of interactive videotape instruction on undergraduate student 's knowledge , performance , and assessment of eight sport skills . Method Participants <p> Participants for this study were 27 undergraduate students who were enrolled in two teaching method classes designed for physical education majors . All students were preparing for K-12 teaching certification in physical education . The undergraduate students represented a spring semester motor development class ( n = 16 ) and a fall semester motor development class ( n = 11 ) . Both sections were taught by the same university instructor who had 18 years of experience in teaching physical education at all levels , coaching at the university level , and conducting professional workshops in motor skill analysis . Each class met two days per week , 50 minutes on Tuesday and Thursday , for 15 weeks . The Task <p> A primary objective of the class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport skills related to volleyball , basketball , and softball . These skills include three volleyball skills ( underhand serve , forearm pass , and overhead pass ) , three basketball skills ( chest pass , set shot , and lay-up ) , and two softball skills ( fielding a ground ball and fielding a fly ball ) . For each of these eight skills , four performance criteria that are representative of a mature pattern were identified . These performance criteria were identified through consultation with elementary , secondary , and post-secondary teachers and NCAA Division 1 head coaches . Each performance criterion was rated on a binary scale ( 0 or 1 ) according to whether the criterion was correctly performed . A total of 32 performance criteria were evaluated for the eight skills . Independent Variables <p> The two instructional methods used in this study were interactive videotape ( IV ) and teacher-directed ( TD ) . Participants in the IV group viewed eight instructional videotapes designed to provide instruction in analyzing each of the sport skills and practiced performing/assessing each of the skills in the gym . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher demonstration , performance practice , and assessment practice involving live performers . Both groups received a total of six hours of instruction and practice . <p> Interactive Videotape ( IV ) Students in the IV group viewed a 15-minute videotape which began with a highly skilled performer demonstrating the performance criteria of one of the given skills . This was followed by a series of eight children of various skill levels performing the skill with dialogue provided ( questions and answers ) regarding their performance . The videotapes provided slow motion and freeze frames to highlight the correct answers for each performance criterion . For the first four children , students listened to and read on the screen a question about the performance criterion , viewed the performance , and made a decision about the answer . The correct answer ( yes or no ) was then provided followed by visual verification ( a still shot with the body segment circled ) . Students completed a checklist for performers five through eight . They viewed each performance five times with a 5-second pause after each trial to record their response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were provided verbally and on screen followed by the visual verification . <p> After viewing the videotape , the students moved to the gym to participate in a practical lab experience . They first practiced demonstrating the performance criteria for the skill with feedback from the instructor . Following the skill practice , the students assessed three peers using a checklist provided by the instructor ( similar to Mosston and Ashworth 's ( 1994 ) reciprocal teaching style ) . The three performers were required to use the nondominant hand or foot and/or to demonstrate at least one error . <p> Teacher Directed ( TD ) The TD group received instruction on the same eight skills but without the videotapes . The instructor identified the performance criteria and provided a minimum of eight demonstrations highlighting the criteria during each demonstration . She then demonstrated each of the four errors for the skill . Although the demonstration was similar to the one in the videotape , a primary difference was that while the videotape provided slow motion and freeze frames to visually verify the performance criterion , the live demonstration could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to observe and assess young students at various skill levels . Following this instruction , students followed the same format described for the IV group ( practice with feedback and assessment of three peers ) . Dependent Variables <p> Students were pretested during the first week of class on the following three dependent variables : knowledge , performance , and assessment of the performance criteria for each skill . A written test in the classroom was used to assess the knowledge component and a formal demonstration in the gym was used to assess performance skills . For the written test , students were asked to identify on paper the four performance criteria for each of the eight skills . The performance test was conducted at stations and/or with partners in a large gym . Students observed and assessed two young children using a checklist for the assessment pretest . This test was conducted using the same standard testing conditions used in the Test of Gross Motor Development ( Ulrich , 1985 ) . The two children first watched a demonstration of the skill and then performed three trials for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was spread out over a six-week period , students were post tested using the same procedure . The two children assessed for the posttest were not the same children assessed in the pretest . Data Analysis <p> A score for each dependent variable was determined for each student by calculating the total number of performance criteria correctly written , performed , and assessed . Since the total number of performance criteria for the eight skills was 32 , this was the highest possible score that could be attained on each of the pre and posttest variables . The two scores ( two children ) for the assessment test were averaged to obtain a single pretest and a single posttest assessment score . A MANCOVA was used to analyze the data . To statistically control for potential pretest differences , the pretest score was used as a covariate anti adjusted posttest means were used to interpret the subsequent statistical analyses . Results <p> The mean scores and percent accuracy for each group are presented in Table 1 . The hypotheses tested were that no significant differences in motor skill knowledge , performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A main effect for group , F(3,20) = 7.49 , p = .001 , was revealed indicating that the two groups were significantly different on the adjusted means of the three variables taken together . An inspection of the univariate results indicated that the IV group scored significantly higher than the TD group on knowledge F(1,22) = 5.88 , p = .018 , performance F(1,22) = 4.57 , p = .040 , and assessment F(1,22) = 9.59 , p = .005 . Discussion <p> The present findings indicate that videotape instruction is more effective than teacher-directed instruction for developing performance and assessment skills . In addition , these results provide evidence that videotape instruction is superior to a teacher-directed approach in developing content knowledge . These results are encouraging considering the relatively short amount of class time that was needed to produce them . Researchers who have investigated the effects of visual training programs on qualitative skill analysis in other studies have reported similar results for catching ( Walkley &; Kelly , 1989 ) , volleyball skills ( Wilkinson , 1990 ) , and fundamental motor skills ( Ignico , 1995 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher than the TD group on the written test suggests that the amount of repetition of the performance criteria on the videotape was sufficient for significant improvement to occur while the amount of repetition in the teacher-directed method may not have been enough . Although encouraging , this result should be interpreted judiciously as the group difference was quite small and both groups achieved high percent accuracy on the posttest ( 97% for the IV group and 91% for the TD group ) . Translated another way , however , the IV group could identify 31 out of 32 performance criteria for the eight skills taken together while the TD group could identify only 29 of the 32 criteria . Since " knowing " all performance cues for the skills one teaches is of critical importance , it appears that in a " real world " teaching situation , the IV group would have a significant advantage over the TD group in teaching these skills . One possible reason for the detected difference may be that while the videotape provided both written and verbal instruction on the performance criteria , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The finding that the IV participants demonstrated better performance skills on the posttest was not expected . Since both groups received the same amount of practice time in the gym , the explanation for this result is open to speculation . Although significant , the adjusted mean group difference was only 0.8 and both groups achieved high scores on the posttest . One possible reason for the detected difference could be that the IV group developed a stronger schema ( Pinheiro &; Simon , 1992 ) for the skills , thereby allowing them to more easily focus on the relevant cues . <p> Of primary importance was the finding that the IV group improved significantly more than the TD group in qualitative assessment skills . Although the TD group did improve in their ability to assess the eight skills , they reached only 77% accuracy on the posttest . In contrast , the IV group attained 83% accuracy following instruction . Again , it seems evident that in a " real world " teaching situation , the IV group would have a distinct advantage over the TD group in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This result is particularly encouraging in light of the documented need to improve undergraduate teacher preparation in qualitative skill assessment . <p> The findings of this study support previous research that has demonstrated visual training programs substantially improve qualitative assessment skills . Without adequate and specialized training in qualitative skill assessment , students will not have the skills to efficiently analyze skill performance and provide accurate feedback . The preparation that students currently receive in teacher education programs may not be sufficient to develop qualitative assessment skills ( Pinheiro &; Simon , 1992 ; Wilkinson , 1990 ) . This poses a challenge for teacher educators who struggle to find the class time to include the many other topics recommended by experts in the field . These findings suggest that the videotape instructional method may be a solution to this challenge and offer an effective alternative to the more traditional teacher-directed method . One solution would be to have students view the videotapes outside of class and submit only the videotape assessment checklist for verification . Because the videotapes are only 15 minutes in length , viewing them at the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another solution . In the " real world , " physical educators must be competent in detecting errors in performance and providing specific feedback for students . Finding the two to three hours of instructional time within a methods class to provide this critical training should be a priority for teacher educators . In their operational model of motor skill diagnosis , Pinheiro and Simon ( 1992 ) recommend that teaching strategies include multiple opportunities to learn what to look for and which phase of the skill is crucial to performance . The interactive videotape instructional method applied both of these strategies . <p> In summary , the results of this study support the inclusion of videotape instruction in sport skill analysis during undergraduate teacher preparation . If the goal of physical education teacher education is to develop a predetermined level of mastery in motor skill assessment , then practical experiences in observing and analyzing movement must be included in the undergraduate teacher preparation program . More investigation is clearly needed to both test these findings and to identify other effective teaching methods to develop observational and assessment skills in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a videotape instructional method is a cost-effective and practical strategy to enhance qualitative assessment skills of undergraduate students .
