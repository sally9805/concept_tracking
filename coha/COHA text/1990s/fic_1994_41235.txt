Ramani had been to Bandra that day , and he was talking about a bungalow on the seafront . It was one of those old three-storied houses with balconies that fan all the way around , set in the middle of a garden filled with palms and fish ponds . It sat stubbornly in the middle of towering apartment buildings , and it had been empty as far back as anyone could remember , and so of course the story that explained this waste of golden real estate was one of ghosts and screams in the night . <p> " They say it 's unsellable. " said Ramani . " They say a Gujarati seth bought it and died within the month . Nobody 'll buy it . Bad place . " <p> Zulfikar Ali , who had retired as a senior physicist at the Atomic Energy Commission , said decisively , " These are all family property disputes . The cases drag on for years and years in courts , and the houses lie vacant because no one will let anyone else live in them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tales in the dark . It was so long ago .

" And so I ca n't . " " It 's true , " Subramaniam said suddenly . He was sitting in his corner , and his voice was barely a whisper , but we all heard it . " Some people meet their ghosts , and some do n't . But we 're all haunted by them . " <p> I laughed with delight , because I knew I was going to get what I wanted . I waved my arm for another drink and settled back into my chair . It was dark already , and when I laid my head back against the wood I was very comfortable . " What do you mean ?

He had been told by the doctors about phantom pain , but the leg had been gone for twenty years without a twinge , and so when he felt a twisting ache two inches under his plastic knee , he stumbled not out of agony but surprise . It was only a little stumble , but the officers who surrounded him turned away out of sympathy , because he was Jago Antia , and he never stumbled . The younger lieutenants flushed with emotion , because they knew for certain that Jago Antia was invincible , and this little lapse , and the way he recovered himself , how he came back to his ramrod straightness , this reminded them of the metallic density of his discipline , which you could see in his gray eyes . He was famous for his stare , for the cold blackness of his anger , for his tactical skill and his ability to read ground , his whole career from the gold medal at Khadakvasla to the combat and medals in Leh and NEFA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg was the center of the legend , and there was something terrible about it , about the story , and so it was never talked about . He drove himself across jungle terrain and shamed men twenty years younger , and it was as if the leg had never been lost . This is why his politeness , his fastidiousness , the delicate way he handled his fork and knife , his slow smile , all these Jago quirks were imitated by even the cadets at the academy : they wished for his certainty , and believed that his loneliness was the mark of his genius . <p> So when he left the bara khana his men looked after him with reverence , and curiously the lapse made them believe in his strength all the more . They had done the party to mark an obscure regimental battle day from half a century before , because he would never have allowed a celebration for himself . After he left they lolled on sofas , sipping from their drinks , and told stories about him . His name was Jehangir Antia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been Jago Antia . Some of them did n't know his real name . <p> Meanwhile , Jago Antia lay on his bed under a mosquito net , his arms flat by his sides , his one leg out as if at attention , the other standing by the bed , and waited for his dream to take him . Every night he thought of falling endlessly through the night , slipping through the cold air , and then somewhere it became a dream , and he was asleep , still falling . He had been doing it for as long as he could remember , long before para school and long before the drop at Sylhet , towards the hostile guns and the treacherous ground . It had been with him from long ago , this leap , and he knew where it took him , but this night a pain grew in that part of him that he no longer had , and he tried to fight it away , imagining the rush of air against his neck , the flapping of his clothes , the complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still awake . When he raised his left hand and uncovered the luminous dial it was oh-four-hundred , and then he gave up and strapped his leg on . He went into the study and spread out some maps and began to work on operational orders . The contour maps were covered with markers , and his mind moved easily among the mountains , seeing the units , the routes of supply , the staging areas . They were fighting an insurgency , and he knew of course that he was doing good work , that his concentration was keen , but he knew he would be tired the next day , and this annoyed him . When he found himself kneading his plastic shin with one hand , he was so angry that he went out on the porch and puffed out a hundred quick push-ups , and in the morning his puzzled batman found him striding up and down the garden walk as the sun came up behind a gaunt ridge . <p> " What are you doing out here ? " Thapa said . Jago Antia had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since Jago Antia had been a captain , and they had long ago discarded with the formalities of master and servant . <p> " Could n't sleep , Thapa . Do n't know what it was . " Thapa raised an eyebrow . " Eat well then . " <p> " Right . Ten minutes ? " <p> Thapa turned smartly and strode off . He was a small , round man , not fat but bulging everywhere with the compact muscles of the mountains . <p> " Thapa ? " Jago Antia called . <p> " Yes . " <p> " Nothing . " He had for a moment wanted to say something about the pain , but then the habit of a lifetime asserted itself , and he threw back his shoulders and shook his head . Thapa waited for a moment and then walked into the house . Now Jago Antia looked up at the razor edge of the ridge far above , and he could see , if he turned his head to one side , a line of tiny figures walking down it . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was fighting . They were committed , hardy , and well-trained . He watched them . He was better . The sun was high now , and Jago Antia went to his work . <p> The pain did n't go away , and Jago Antia could n't sleep . Sometimes he was sure he was in his dream , and he was grateful for the velocity of the fall , and he could feel the cold on his face , the dark , but then he would sense something , a tiny glowing pinpoint that spun and grew and finally became a bright hurling maelstrom that wrenched him back into wakefulness . Against this he had no defense : no matter how tired he made himself , how much he exhausted his body , he could not make his mind insensible to his phantom pain , and so his discipline , honed over the years , was made useless . Finally he conquered his shame , and asked  --  in the strictest confidence  --  the colonel at Medical Services for medication , and got , along with a very puzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt in his pocket all day , against his chest . But at night these pills too proved no match for the ferocity of the pain , which by now Jago Antia imagined as a beast of some sort , a low growling animal that camouflaged itself until he was almost at rest and then came rushing out to worry at his flesh , or at the memory of his flesh . It was not that Jago Antia minded the defeat , because he had learnt to accept defeat and casualties and loss , but it was that he had once defeated this flesh , it was he who had swung the kukri , but it had come back now and surprised him . He felt outflanked , and this infuriated him , and further , there was nothing he could do about it , there was nothing to do anything about . <p> So his work suffered , and he felt the surprise of those around him . It shamed him more than anything else that they were not disappointed , but sympathetic . They brought him tea without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves in whispers , his headquarters ran  --  if it was possible  --  even more efficiently than before , with the gleam of spit and polish about it . But now he was tired , and when he looked at the maps he felt the effort he had to make to grasp the flow of the battle  --  not the facts , which were important , though finally trivial  --  but the thrust and the energy of the struggle , the movement of the initiative , the flux and ebb of the chaotic thing . One afternoon he sat in his office , the pain a constant hum just below his attention , and the rain beat down in gusts against the windows , and the gleam of lightning startled him into realizing that his jaw was slack , that he had been staring aimlessly out of the window at the green side of the mountain , that he had become the sot of commander he despised , a man who because of his rank allowed himself to become careless . He knew he would soon make the sort of mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was unacceptable : without hesitation he called the medical colonel and asked to be relieved of his command for medical reasons . <p> The train fide to Bombay from Calcutta was two days long , and there was a kind of relief in the long rhythms of the wheels , in the lonely clangings of the tracks at night . Jago Antia sat next to a window in a first class compartment and watched the landscape change , taken back somehow to a fifth-grade classroom and lessons on the crops of the Deccan . Thapa had taken a week 's leave to go to his family in Darjeeling and was to join up in Bombay later . Jago Antia was used to solitude , but the relief from immediate responsibility brought with it a rush of memory , and he found the unbidden recall of images from the past annoying , because it all seemed so useless . He tried to take up the time usefully by reading NATO journals , but even under the hard edge of his concentration the pain throbbed in time with the wheels , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had run out of history class to watch two fighter planes fly low over the city . By the time the train pulled into Bombay Central , he felt as if he was covered not only with sweat and grit , but also with an oily film of recollection , and he marched through the crowd towards the taxi stand , eager for a shower . <p> The house stood in a square plot on prime residential land in Khar , surrounded by new , extravagant constructions colored the pink and green of new money . But it was mostly dark brown , stained by decades of sea air and monsoon rains , and in the late afternoon sun it seemed to gather the light about it as it sat surrounded by trees and untidy bushes . There was , in its three stories , in the elegant arches on the balconies , and in the rows of shuttered windows , something rich and dense and heavy , like the smell of gun oil on an old hunting rifle , and the taxi driver sighed , " They do n't build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're draughty and take a fortune to keep up , " said Jago Antia curtly as he handed him the money . It was true . Amir Khan the housekeeper was waving slowly from the porch . He was very old , with a thin neck and a white beard that gave him the appearance of a heron , and by the time he was halfway down the flight of stairs Jago Antia had the bags out of the car and up to the house . Inside , with Amir Khan puffing behind him , he paused to let his eyes take to the darkness , but it felt as if he were pushing his way through something substantial and insidious , more clear than fog but as inescapable . It was still much as he had left it many years ago to go to the Academy . There were the Victorian couches covered with faded flower pints , the gold-rimmed paintings on the wall of his grandparents and uncles . He noticed suddenly how quiet it was , as if the street and the city outside had vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . <p> " Ca n't , " Amir Khan said . " It 's been closed up for years . All just sheets on the furniture . Even your parents slept in the old study . They moved a bed into it . " Jago Antia shrugged . It was more convenient on the ground floor in any case . " It 's all right . It 's just for a few days . I have some work here . I 'll see Todywalla too . " <p> " What about ? " <p> " Well , I want to sell the house . " <p> " You want to sell the house ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> Amir Khan shuffled away to the kitchen , and Jago Antia heard him knocking about with cups and saucers . He had no intention of using the house again , and he saw no other alternative . His parents were dead , gone one after another in a year . He had been a distant son , meeting them on leave in Delhi and Lucknow while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away from Bombay , he had always seen the old disappointment and weariness in their eyes . Now it was over , and he wanted not to think about the house anymore . <p> " Good , sell this house . " It was Amir Khan with a cup of tea . " Sell it . " <p> " I will . " <p> " Sell it . " Jago Antia noticed that Amir Khan 's hands were shaking , and he remembered suddenly an afternoon in the garden when he had made him throw ball after ball to his off side , and his own attempts at elegant square cuts , and the sun high overhead though the palm trees . <p> " We 'll do something for you , " said Jago Antia . " Do n't worry . <p> " Sell it , " Amir Khan said , " I 'm tired of it . " <p> Jago Antia tried to dream of falling , but his ache stayed with him , and besides the gusts of water against the windows were loud and unceasing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white illumination of lightning threw the whole room into sharp relief . He was thinking about the Academy , about how he had been named Jago two weeks after his arrival . His roommate had found him at five o'clock on a Saturday morning doing push-ups on the gravel outside their room , and rubbing his eyes he had said , " Antia , you 're an enthusiast . " He had never known where the nickname Jago came from , but after the second week nobody except his parents had called him Jehangir again . When he had won the sword for Best Cadet even the colonel commandant of the Academy had said to him at the reviewing stand , " Good show , Jago . " He had been marked for advancement early , and he had never betrayed his promise . He was thinking of this , and the wind flapped the curtains above him , and when he first heard the voice far away he thought it was a trick of the air , but then he head it again . It was muffled by distance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make out what it was saying . He was alert instantly and snapped on his leg . Even though he knew it was probably Amir Khan talking to himself , flicking away with a duster in the imagined light of some long-gone day , he moved cautiously , back against the wall . At the bottom of the hallway he paused , and heard it again , small but distinct , above him . He found the staircase and went up , his thighs tense , moving in a fluid half-squat . Now he was truly watchful , because the voice was too young to be Amir Khan . On the first landing , near an open door , he sensed a rush of motion on the balcony that ran around the outside of the house ; he came to the corner , feeling his way with his hands . Everything in the darkness appeared as shades , blackness and deeper blackness . He darted a look around the corner , and the balcony was empty , he was sure of it . He came around the comer , back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not distinct footsteps but the swish of feet on the ground , one after the another . He froze . Whatever it was , it was coming towards him . His eyes ached in the darkness , but he could see nothing . Then the white blaze of lightning swept across the lawn , throwing the filigreed ironwork of the railing sharply on the wall , across Jago Antia 's belly , and in the long light he saw on the floor the clearly outlined shape of shoes , one after another , the patches of water a sharp black in the light , and as he watched another footprint appeared on the tile , and then another , coming towards him . <p> Before it was dark again he was halfway down the stairs . He stopped , alone with the beating of his heart . He forced himself to stand up straight , to look carefully about and above the staircase for dead ground and lines of fire . He had learnt long ago that professionalism was a much better way to defeat fear than self-castigation and shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only possible conclusion was that it had been a trick of the light on the water , and so he was able to move up the staircase , smooth and graceful once again . But on the landing a breath of air curled around his ankle like a flow of cool liquid , and he began to shiver . It was a freezing chill that spread up his thighs and into his groin , and it caught him so suddenly that he let his teeth chatter for a moment . Then he bit down , but despite his straining he could hardly take a step before he stopped again . It was so cold that his fingers ached . His eyes filled with moisture and suddenly the dark was full of soft shadows . Again he heard the voice , far away , melancholy and low . With a groan he collapsed against the banister and slid down the stairs , all the way to the bottom , his leg rattling on the steps . Through the night he tried it again and again , and once he made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the strength from his hips , so that he had to crawl on hands and knees to the descent . At dawn he sat shaken and weak on the first step , his arm around the comforting curve of the thick round post . <p> Finally it was the shock in Thapa 's eyes that raised Jago Antia from the stupor he had fallen into . For three days he had been pacing , unshaven and unwashed , at the bottom of the stairs , watching the light make golden shapes in the air . Now Thapa had walked through the front door , and it was his face , slack , and the fact that he forgot to salute that conveyed to Jago Antia how changed he was , how shocking he was . <p> " It 's all right , " Jago Antia said . " I 'm all right . " <p> Thapa still had his bag in his right hand and an umbrella in the left , and he said nothing . Jago Antia remembered then a story that was a part of his own legend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a tea stain on his shirt . It was quite true . <p> " Put out a change of clothes , " he said . " And close your mouth . " <p> The water in the shower drummed against Jago Antia 's head and cleared it . He saw the insanity of what had gone on for three days , and he was sue it was exhaustion . There was nothing there , and the important thing was to get to the hospital , and then to sell the house . He ate breakfast eagerly , and felt almost relaxed . Then Amir Khan walked in with a glass of milk on a tray . For three days he had been bringing milk instead of tea , and now when Jago Antia told him to take it back to the kitchen , he said , " Baba , you have to drink it . Mummy said so . You know you 're not allowed to drink tea . " And he shuffled away , walking through a suddenly-revived age when Jehangir Antia was a boy in knickers , agile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jago Antia felt time slipping around him like a dark wave , but then he shook away the feeling and stood up . <p> " Call a taxi , " he said to Thapa . <p> The doctors at Jaslok were crisp and confident in their poking and prodding , and the hum of machinery comforted him . But Todywalla , sitting in his disorderly office , said bluntly , " Sell that house ! Na , impossible . There 's something in it . " <p> " Oh do n't be ridiculous , " said Jago Antia vehemently . <p> " That 's absurd . " <p> Todywalla looked keenly at him . Todywalla was a toothless old man with a round black cap squarely on the middle of his head . " Ah , " he said . " So you 've heard it too . " <p> " I have n't heard a damn thing , " Jago Antia said . " Be rational . " <p> " You may be a rationalist , " Todywalla said . " But I sell houses in Bombay . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something in that house . " <p> When the taxi pulled through the gate Thapa was standing in the street outside , talking to a vegetable seller and two other men . As Jago Antia pulled off his shoes in the living room , Thapa came in and went to the kitchen . He came back a few minutes later with a glass of water . <p> " Tomorrow I will find my cousin at the bank at Nariman Point , " he said . " And we will get somebody to come to this house . We should n't sleep here . " <p> " What do you mean , somebody ? " <p> " Somebody who can clean it up . " Thapa 's round face was tight , and there were white crescents around his temples . " Somebody who knows . " <p> " Knows what exactly ? What are you talking about ? " Thapa nodded towards the gate . " No one on this street will come near this place after dark . Every one knows . They were telling me not to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ca n't fight this , saab , " Thapa said . After a pause : " Not even you . " <p> Jago Antia stood erect . " I will sleep tonight quietly and so will you . No more of this foolishness . " He marched into the study and lay on the bed , loosening his body bit by bit , and under the surface of his concentration the leg throbbed evenly . The night came on and passed . He thought finally that nothing would happen , and there was a gray outside the window , but then he heard again the incessant calling . He took a deep breath , and walked into the drawing room . Thapa was standing by the door , his whole body straining away from the stairs . Jago Antia took two steps forward . " Come on , " he said . His voice rustled across the room , and both of them jerked . He read the white tightness of terror around Thapa 's mouth , and as he had done many times before he led by example . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs , and he did not look behind him to see if Thapa was following . He knew the same pride and shame which was taking him up the stairs would bring Thapa : as long as they saw themselves in each other 's eyes they would not let the other down . He had tested this in front of machine guns and found it to be true . So now they moved , Thapa a little behind and flanking , up the stairs . This time he came up to the landing and was able to move out , through the door , onto the balcony . He was moving , moving . But then the voice came around a corner and he stood still , feeling a rush in his veins . It was amazing , he found himself thinking , how localized it was . He could tell from moment to moment where it was on the balcony . It was not a trick of the wind , not a hallucination . Thapa was still against the wall , his palms against it , his mouth working back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It came closet , and now Jago Antia was able to hear what it was saying : " Where shall I go ? " The question was asked with a sob in it , like a tearing hiccup , so close that Jago Antia heard it shake the small frame that asked it . He felt a sound in his own throat , a moan , something like pain , sympathy . Then he felt the thing pause , and though there was nothing but the air he felt it coming at him , first hesitating , then faster , asking again , where shall I go , where , and he backed away from it , fast , tripping over his heels , and he felt the railing of the balcony on his thighs , hard , and then he was falling . <p> The night was dark below . They plummeted head-first from the belly of the plane into the cool pit at a thousand feet , and Jago Antia relished the leap into reality . They had been training long enough , and now he did not urn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew his men and their skill . The chute popped with a flap , and after the jerk he flew the sky with his legs easy in the harness . Then the only feature he could see was the silver curve of the river far below , and then quite suddenly the dark mass of trees and the swathe of fields . There were no lights in the city of Sylhet , but he knew it was there , to the east , and he knew the men who were in it , defending against him , and he saw the problem clearly and the movements across the terrain below . <p> Then he was rolling across the ground , and the chute was off . Around him was the controlled confusion of a nighttime drop , and swiftly out of that formed the shape of his battalion . He had the command group around him , and in a few minutes they were racing towards their first objectives . Now he was sweating freely , and the weight of his pistol swung against his hip . He could smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first gray , to the east , the harsh tearing noise of LMG fire flung the birds out of the trees . Delta Bravo I have contact over . As Jago Antia thumbed the mouthpiece , his radioman smiled at him , nineteen and glowing in the dawn . Delta Bravo , bunkers , platoon strength , I am going in now . Alpha Company had engaged . <p> As the day came they moved into the burning city , and the buildings were torn by explosions and the shriek of rockets skimming low over the streets and ringing off the walls . Now the noise echoed and boomed , and it was difficult to tell where it was coming from , butJago Antia still saw it all forming on his map , which was stained black now with sweat here and there , and dust , and the plaster knocked from the walls by bullets . He was icy now , his mind holding it all , and as an excited captain reported to him he listened silently , and there was the flat crack of a grenade , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he saw that Jago Antia was calm as if he were walking down a golf course in Wellingdon , not a street shining with glass , thousands of shards sharp as death , no , he was meditative and easy . So the captain went back to his boys with something of Jago Antia 's slow watchfulness in his walk , and he put away his nervousness and smiled at them , and they nodded , crouched behind cracked walls , sure of each other and Jago Antia . <p> Now in the morning the guns echoed over the city , and a plummy BBC voice sounded over a Bush radio in the remnants of a tailor 's shop : " Elements of the Indian Para Brigade are said to be in the outskirts of Sylhet . Pakistani troops are dug in ... " Jago Antia was looking at the rounded curves of the radio on the tailor 's shelf , at the strange white knobs and the dial from decades ago , at the deep brown wood , and a shiver came from low on his back into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not name it , and yet it broke his concentration and took him away from his body and this room with its drapes of cloth to somewhere else , a flickering vision of a room , curtains blowing in a gusting wind , a feeling of confusion , he shook his head and swallowed . He curled the knob with the back of his hand so that it snapped the voice off and broke with a crack . Outside he could feel the fight approaching a crisis , the deep whiplash of the 7.62s and the lighter Pakistani fire , cresting and falling like waves but always higher , it was likely the deciding movement . He had learnt the waiting that was the hardest part of commanding , and now the reports came quickly , and he felt the battle forming to a crescendo ; he had a reserve , sixty men , and he knew now where he was going to put them . They trotted down the street to the east and paused on a dusty street corner ( the relentless braying scream of a Bren nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the street , a white three-storied house with a decorative vine running down the font in concrete , now chipped and holed . " Tall enough , " Jago Antia said : he wanted a vantage point to see the city laid out for him . He started off confidently across the street , and then all the sound in the world vanished , leaving a smooth silence , he had no recollection of being thrown , but now he was falling through the air , down , he felt distinctly the impact of the ground , but again there was nothing , no sound . <p> After a while he was able to see the men above him as he was lifted , their lips moving serenely even though their faces were twisted with emotion , they appeared curved and bent inwards against a spherical sky . He shut and opened his eyes several times , searching for connections that seemed severed . They carried him into a house . Then he was slowly able to hear again , and with the sound he began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside his head , in a place in which he had never felt pain before . But he strained and finally he was able to find , inside , some part of himself , and his body jerked , and they held him still . His jaw cracked , and he said : <p> " What ? " <p> It was a mine on the corner , they told him . Now he was fighting it , he was using his mind , he felt his strength coming back , he could find his hands , and he pushed against the bed and sat up . A corpsman pushed at his shoulders , but he struck the hands away and took a deep breath . Then he saw his leg . Below his right knee the flesh was white and twisted away from the bone . Below the ankle was a shapeless bulk of matter , and the corpsman was looking for the artery but as Jago Antia watched the black blood seeped out onto the floor . Outside , the firing was ceaseless now , and Jago Antia was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer knew where his boys were . The confusion came and howled around his head , and for a moment he was lost . " Cut it off , " he said then . " Off .

" No time . Cut it off now , " he said , but the corpsman was dabbing with the bandages . Jago Antia said to Jung : " You do it , now . Quickly . " They were all staring at him , and he knew he could not make them cut him . " Give me your kukri , " he said to Jung . The boy hesitated but then the blade came out of its scabbard with a hiss that Jago Antia heard despite the ceaseless roar outside . He steadied himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , and there was impossibly the sound of the sea inside him , a sob rising in his throat , he opened his eyes and fought it , pulled against it with his shoulders as he raised the kukri above his head , against darkness and mad sorrow , and then he brought the blade down below his knee . What surprised him was the crunch it made against the bone . In four strokes he was through . Each was easier . " Now , " he said , and the corpsman tied it off . Jago Antia waved off the morphine , and he saw that Jung the radioman was crying . On the radio Jago Antia 's voice was steady . He took his reports , and then he sent his reserve in . They heard his voice across Sylhet . " Now then , " he said , " Finish it . " <p> The room that Jago Antia woke up in had a cracked white ceiling , and for a long time he did not know where he was , in Sylhet ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house of his childhood after a fall from the balcony , or in some other room , unknown : everything seemed to be thrown together in his eyes without shape or distinction , and from moment to moment he forgot the flow of time , and found himself talking to Amir Khan about cricket , and then suddenly it was evening . Finally he was able to sit up in bed , and a doctor fussed about him : there were no injuries , the ground was soft from the rain , his paratrooper 's reflexes had turned him in the air and rolled him on the ground , bur . he was bruised , and a concussion could not be ruled out . He was to stay in bed and rest . When the doctor left Thapa brought in a plate of rice and dal , and stood at the foot of the bed with his arms behind him . " I will talk to my cousin tonight .

Then the man took the thali from Thapa and walked slowly into the house , and as he came closer Jago Antia saw that he was in his late forties , that he was heavyset , that he was neither ugly nor handsome . " My name is Thakker , " he said to Jago Antia before he sat cross-legged in the middle of the living room , in front of the stairs , and lit the diya .

He walked out into the horizon , mass upon mass of dark heads piled up thousands of feet high , and as he watched a silver dart of lightning flickered noiselessly , and then another . Now his back began to ache slightly , and he shook his head slowly , overwhelmed by the certainty that he no longer knew anything . He turned around and looked up the path , into the house , and through the twilight he could see the tiny gleam of Thakker 's diya , and as he watched Thakker lifted the thali and walked slowly towards the stairs , into the shadow , so that finally it seemed that the flame was rising up the stairs . Then Thapa came out , and they stood in the garden together , and the breeze from the sea was full of the promise of rain . They waited as night fell , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chanting , and then , very faint , that other voice , blown away by the gusts of wind . Finally  --  Jago Antia did not know what time it was  --  Thakker came down the stairs , carrying the thali , but the diya was blown out . They walked up to meet him on the patio , under the faint light of a single bulb . <p> " It is very strong , " he said . <p> " What is it ? " said Jago Antia angrily . <p> Thakker shrugged . " It is most unmovable . " His face was drawn and pale . " It is a child . It is looking for something . Most terrible . Very strong . " <p> " Well , get it out . " <p> " I can not . Nobody can move a child . " <p> Jago Antia felt a rush of panic , like a steady pressure against his chest . <p> Thapa said , " What can we do ? " <p> Thakker walked past them , down the stairs , and then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who it is ? " Jago Antia said nothing , his lips held tightly together to stop them from trembling . " It is most powerful because it is a child and because it is helpless and because it is alone . Only one who knows it and who is from its family can help it . Such a person must go up there naked and alone . Remember , alone and naked , and ask it what it seeks . " Thakker wiped away the white powder from his forehead slowly , and then he turned and walked away . It was now drizzling , fat drops that fell out of the sky insistently . <p> Out of the darkness Thakker called . " You must go . " Then a pause in which Jago Antia could hear , somewhere , rushing water . " Help him . " <p> At the bottom of the stairs Jago Antia felt his loneliness like a bitterness in his nostrils , like a stench . Thapa watched from the door , remote already , and there seemed to be nothing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old house , the wind in the balconies . as Jago Antia walked slowly up the stairs , unbuttoning his shirt , his pulse was rushing in his head , each beat like an explosion , not out of fear any more but from a kind of anticipation , because now he knew who it was , who waited for him . On the landing he kicked off his shoes and unbuckled his belt , and whispered , " What can you want from me , I was a child too . " He walked slowly around the balcony , and the rain dashed against his shoulders and rolled down his back . He came to the end of the balcony , at a door with beveled glass , and he peered through it , and he could dimly make out the ornate curves of his mother 's dressing table , the huge mirror , and beyond that the bed now covered with sheets , he stood with his face against the cool pane . He shut his eyes . Somewhere deep came the poisonous seep of memory , he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother was looking at him , he eyes unfocussed in a kind of daze . She was a very beautiful woman , and she was sitting in front of her mirror now as she always did , but her hair was untidy , and she was wearing a white sari . He was sitting on the edge of her bed , his feet stuck out , and he was looking at his black shoes and white socks , and he was trying to be very still because he did not know what was going to happen next . He was dressed up , and the house was full of people , but it was very quiet and the only sounds were the pigeons on the balcony . He was afraid to move , and after a while he began to count his breaths , in and out . Then his father came in , he stood next to his mother , put a hand on her shoulder , and they looked at each other for a long time , and he wanted to say that they looked like their picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he knew he could n't so he kept himself still and waited . Then his father said to his mother , come , and they rose and he walked behind them a little . She was leaning on his father , and they came down the stairs and everyone watched them . Downstairs he saw his uncles and aunts and other people he did n't know , and in the middle of the room there was a couch and on it lay his brother Sohrab . Sohrab had been laid out and draped in a white sheet . There was a kind of oil lamp with a wick burning near Sohrab 's head , and a man was whispering a prayer into his ear . There was a smell of sandalwood in the air . Then his mother said , " Soli , Soli , " and his father turned his face away , and a breath passed through the room , and he saw many people crying . That was what they always called Sohrab . He was Soli , and that was how Jehangir always thought of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father too , and he was alone , and he did n't know what to do , but he stood straight up , and he kept his hands by his sides . Then two men came forward , and they covered Soli 's face , and then other people lifted him up , and they took him through the door , and for a long time he could see them walking through the garden towards the gate . His mother was sitting on the sofa with her sisters , and after a while he turned around and walked up the stairs , and above there was nobody , and he walked through the rooms and around the balcony , and after a while he thought he was waiting for something to happen , but it never did . <p> Jago Antia 's forehead trembled against the glass and now he turned and walked down the corridor that ran around the house , through darkness and sudden light , and he walked by a playroom , and then his father 's study , and as he walked he felt that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him . He heard the voice asking its question but his own desperate question seemed to twist in his throat and come out only as a sound , a sort of sob of anger . It went into the room that had been his room and Soli 's room , and he stopped at the door , his chest shaking , looking at the floor where they had wrestled each other , the bureau between the beds on which they had stacked their books and their toys . The door creaked open under his hand , and inside he sat on this bed , in the middle , where he used to , and they were listening to the Binaca Geet Mala on the radio , Soli loved his radio and the Binaca Geet Mala . He was lying on the bed in his red pajamas and the song went Maine shayad tumhe pahale bhi kahin dekha hai , Soli sang along with it , Jehangir was not allowed to touch the radio , but when Soli was away he sometimes played with the knobs , and once he switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away speaking angrily in a language he did n't understand , it scared him and he ran away from it , and Soli found his radio on , and then there was a fight . Jehangir lost the fight , but Soli always won , even with the other boys on the street , he was fearless , and he jumped over walls , and he led them all , and at cricket he was always the captain of one side , and sometimes in the evenings , still in his barrister 's clothes , their father watched their games in the garden , and he said that Soli had a lovely style . When he said this the first time Jehangir raised his head and blinked because he understood instantly what his father meant , he had known it all along but now he knew the words for it , and he said it to himself sometimes under his breath , a lovely style , a lovely style . Now Soli raised himself up in bed on an elbow , and Amir Khan brought in two glasses of milk on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat as he did on Soli 's bed , and tonight he had The Illustrated Weekly of India in his hand , folded open to a tall picture of a man with a moustache and a bat , and he said , " Look at him ; he was the Prince . " So he told them about Ranji-Sinhji , who was really a prince , who went to England where they called him nigger and wog , but he showed them , he was the most beautiful batsman , like a dancer he turned their bouncers to the boundaries with his wrists , he drove with clean elegance , he had good manners , and he said nothing to their insults , and he showed them all he was the best of them all , he was the Prince , he was lovely . After their father left Soli put The Illustrated Weekly in his private drawer , and after that Jehangir would see him take it out and look at it , and sometimes he would let Jehangir look at it , and Jehangir would look at the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opaque eyes , and he would feel a surge of pride himself , and Soli would have his wiry hand on his shoulder , and they would both say together , Ranji-Sinhji , Ranji . <p> That summer one Sunday afternoon they were dozing in the heat when suddenly Burjor Mama came in and tumbled them both out of bed , roaring what a pair of sleepyhead sissy types , and they laughed with delight because he was their favorite uncle . They knew his arrival meant at least two weeks of unexpected pleasures , excursions to Juhu , sailing trips , films , shows and sizzling forbidden pavement foods . Their mother came in and hugged him close , and they were embarrassed by her tears , Burjor was her only younger brother and more precious for his profession of soldiering , she was exclaiming now how he was burnt black by the sun , what are they doing to you now , and he was really dark , but Jehangir liked his unceasing whiplike energy and the sharp pointed ends of his handlebar moustache . Barely pausing to thump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole family , Amir Khan included , and he whisked them off for a drive , and he whistled as he drove . On the way back Jehangir , weighted down with ice cream , fell asleep with his head in his mother 's lap , and once for a moment he awoke and saw , close to his face , his mother 's hand holding her brother 's wrist tenderly and close , her delicate fingers very pale against his skin with the strong corded muscles underneath . <p> And Jago Antia , walking down the corridor , walking , felt the sticky sleep of childhood and the cosy hum of the car and safety . And then he was at the bottom of a flight of stairs , he knew he had to go up , because it had gone before him , and now he stumbled because the pain came , and it was full of fear , he went up , one two three , and then leaned over , choking . Above him the stairs angled into darkness and the roof he knew so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling , and the voice was speaking somewhere ahead , he said , " I do n't want to go , " but then he heard it again . He knew his hands were shaking , and he said , " All right you bastard , naked , naked , " and he tore at the straps , and then the leg rolled down the stairs to the bottom . He went up , hunching , on hands and knees , his lips curled back and breathing in huge gasps . <p> Burjor Mama bought them a kite . On Monday morning he had to report in Colaba for work , and so Jehangir 's mother brought up his pressed uniform and put it on the bed in the guest room . Jehangir lay on the bed next to the uniform and took in its peculiar smell , it was a deep olive green , and the bars on the front were of many colors but mainly fed and orange , and above a breast pocket it said , B. MEHTA . Jehangir 's mother sat on the bed too and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Burjor Mama came out of the bathroom in a towel . As he picked up the shirt , Jehangir saw under the sadra , under and behind his left arm , a scar shaped like a star , brown and hard against the pale skin . Then Jehangir looked up and he saw his mother 's face , tender and proud and a little angry as she looked at Burjor . After breakfast Soli and Jehangir walked with him to the gate , and he said , " See you later , alligators , " and in the afternoon they waited on the porch for him , reading comics and sipping at huge glasses of squash . When the taxi stopped at the gate they had run forward , whooping , because even before he was out they had seen the large triangle of the kite , and then they ran up without pause to the roof , Soli holding the kite at the ends , and Jehangir following behind with the roll of string . Jehangir held the roll as Soli spun off the manjha , and Soli said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tie the kite string , once up , once down , and then they had it up in the ail , it was doing spirals and rolls , and Soli said , " Yaar , that 's a fighting kite ! " Nobody was flying to fight with nearby , but when their father came up he laughed and watched them , and when they went down to tea Soli 's fingers were cut from the manjha , and when Jehangir asked Burjor Mama said , " It 's ground glass on the line . " <p> Now he came up the stairs , his stump bumping on the edges of the stone , and his palm scraped against something metal , but he felt the sting distantly and without interest . The next day Soli lay stretched across the roof , his mouth open . Jago Antia pulled himself up , his arms around a wooden post , and he could see the same two-level roof , Amir Khan 's old room to one side , with its sloping roof coming to the green posts holding it up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then a three-foot drop with a metal ladder leading to the lower level of the roof , and beyond that the treetops and the cold stretch of the ocean . He let go of the post and swayed gently in the rain . Soli walked in front of him , his hands looping back the string , sending the kite fluttering strongly through the sky , and Jehangir held the coil and took up the slack . It flew in circles above them . " Let me fly it , " Jehangir said . " Let me fly it . " But Soli said , " You ca n't hold this , it 'll cut you . " " I can hold anything . I can . " " You ca n't , it 'll hurt you . " " It wo n't . I wo n't let it . " And Jehangir ran forward , Soli danced away , light and confident , backwards , and then for a moment his face was surprised , And then he was Lying below , three feet below on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antia dropped to his knee , then fell heavily on his side . He pulled himself through the water , to the edge , next to the metal stairs , and he peered down trying to see the bottom but it seemed endless , but he knew it was only three feet below . How can somebody die falling three feet ? He heard the voice asking its question , where shall I go , and he roared into the night , " What do you want ? What the hell is it you want ? " But it would n't stop , and Jago Antia knelt on the edge and wept , " What do you want , " and finally he said , " Look , look , " and he pushed himself up , leaned forward , and let himself go , and he fell : he saw again Soli backing away , Jehangir reaching up trying to take his hand away from the string , Soli holding his hand far up , and Jehangir helpless against his strength . Then Soli smiling , standing , and Jehangir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his small body against Soli 's legs , Soli 's look of surprise , he 's falling , reaching wildly , Jehangir 's hand under the bottom of Soli 's shorts , he holds on and tries , holds and pulls , but then he feels the weight taking him over , and he wo n't let go , but he has n't the strength , he 's falling with Soli , he feels the impact of the bricks though Soli 's body . <p> When Jago Antia stirred weakly on the roof , when he looked up , it was dawn . He held himself up and said , " Are you still here ? Tell me what you want . " Then he saw at the parapet , very dim and shifting in the gray light , the shape of a small body , a boy looking down over the edge towards the ocean . As Jago Antia watched , the boy turned slowly , and in the weak light he saw that the boy was wearing a uniform of olive green , and he asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , but then his voice caught , because he was remembering his next and seventh birthday , the first party without Soli , and his parents holding him between them , soothing him , saying you must want something , and he looking up at their faces , at the lines in his father 's face , the exhaustion in his mother 's eyes . Burjor Mama sits on the carpet behind him with head down , and Amir Khan stands behind , and Jehangir shakes his head , nothing . His mother 's eyes fill with tears , and she kisses him on the forehead , " Baba , it 's all right , let us give you a present , " and his heart breaks beneath a surging weight , but he stands up straight and looking at her and his father , he says , " I want a uniform . " So Jago Antia looked at the boy as he came closer , and he saw the small letters above the pocket , J. ANTIA , and the sun came up , and he saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the eyes he saw his vicious and ravenous strength , his courage and his devotion , his silence and his pain , his whole misshapen and magnificent life , and Jago Antia said , " Jehangir , Jehangir , you 're already at home . " <p> Thapa and Amir Khan came up the stairs slowly , and he called out to them , " Come , come . I 'm all right . " He was sitting cross-legged , watching the sun move in and out of the clouds . Thapa squatted beside him . " Was it here ? " <p> " He 's gone . I saw him , and then he vanished . " <p> " Who ? " <p> Jago Antia shook his head . " Someone I did n't know before . " <p> " What was he doing here then ? " <p> " He was lost . " He leaned on both their shoulders , one arm around each , for the descent down the stairs . Somehow , naked and hopping from stair to stair , he was smiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still and forever Jago Antia , that for him it was too late for anything but a kind of solitude , that he would give his body to the fire , that in the implacable hills to the North , among the rocks , he and other men and women , each with histories of their own , would find each other for life and for death . And yet he felt free . He sat on the porch , strapping his leg on , and Amir Khan brought out three cups of tea . Thapa wrapped a sheet around him , and looking at each other they both laughed . " Thank you , " Jago Antia said . hen they drank the tea together . <p>
