Emmy and her little brother Max ( and with names like those , you can bet their folks are PBS donors ) find a magic dragon scale and are whisked off to Dragon Land , where they encounter a gaggle of warm , goofy reptilian friends to whom they are just as strange as the monsters are to them . Besides fantasy and rich , hand-painted scenery , this animated series offers an encouraging message  --  do n't be afraid of new situations  --  to a young audience exploring its own realm of freakish curiosities . <P>  --  J.P .
