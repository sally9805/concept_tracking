The Diamond Mountains : January 26 , 1998 At first he did n't hear it . The noise was a long way off and hundreds of meters below , a distant growl gusting on the wind . Trudging slowly up the hillside , Kang kept his head down , ignoring both the wind 's moan and the sound that it carried in its jaws . The cold made him clumsy . Twice he 'd slipped on the ice , and twice he 'd broken the fall with his hands , plunging his fingers into the crusted snow . With the holes in his gloves , it was like grabbing broken glass . Even so , he 'd surprised himself by coming as far as he had -- and in the dead of winter . He was , after all , a cripple . But tough . Korean tough . And though others had come this way before -- he 'd climbed through a ghost forest in which a thousand pines had been reduced to stumps -- they 'd had two good legs to carry them . While he had only one . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as he climbed higher , Kang saw pines that had been flayed alive , the bark stripped from their trunks for food . Or what passed for food in the famine years . The soft wood , just beneath the bark , filled the stomach . And while it was barely digestible , it was pleasant to chew . It took away the hunger pains -- at least for a while -- and the bark itself could be used to make a weak tea . Still , taking the bark killed the trees , and wounded the land . It was the women , mostly , who climbed the hills to look for wild grasses , bark , and firewood . Until the sickness had taken her , as it had taken so many others , Kang 's wife had climbed this very hill , armed with the same folding saw that he now carried , and the same length of rope . It was she who 'd told him to go in this direction . And though the way was impossibly steep , he 'd kept his promise and done as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trek a dozen times , trading the wood that he 'd gathered for herbs , rice , and a pair of old boots . By now he knew the hills above Tasi-ko as well as he knew the cracks in the ceiling above his bed . He paused for a moment to catch his breath , and gazed at the uphill terrain , calculating the most efficient way over the rocks , deciding ahead of time where to set each foot . This was more complicated than it might otherwise have been because one of his legs was made of wood below the knee and was insensitive to differences in footing . An open area stretched ahead of him , and he picked his way carefully across the snowfield , wary of crevasses . Finally , he crested a ridge and came upon the place that he was looking for , a grove of sturdy pines , bristling with green needles above the snow . As always happened when he came here , his wife 's face flashed before him and his eyes brimmed with tears . Then he lurched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a twig from its trunk and sucked at the resin . As he did , he glanced around for a suitable tree , one that he could cut with his saw and drag to the village . And that 's when he heard it , heard it for the first time in the silence of the pines : riding on the back of the wind was a separate and distinct noise , a mechanical whine that he recognized in an instant . It was the sound of deliverance , the clamor of rescue . Hobbling back to the ridge , Kang squinted down the hillside to the road , where a convoy of trucks rolled toward Tasi-ko , miniaturized by distance . All in all there were six troop transports , a jeep , and a couple of flatbed trailers with orange bulldozers strapped to their backs . Watching them , as Kang did , it was possible to trace the path that the convoy had taken , winding its way through the valley . The chained tires , chewing into the snow and ice , churned up the earth so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had drawn a line across the jagged contours of the land . For the first time in weeks the corners of his mouth lifted and Kang smiled . With a grunt of relief he sat down heavily in the snow and , using a small tool he carried for the purpose , adjusted the screws in his artificial leg . Things would be better now . Not that they could have gotten worse . This was the most monstrous winter in anyone 's memory , a season of paralyzing cold in which hunger had turned into famine , and famine to plague . Even now , thirty-one people -- a fourth of the village -- lay on the floor of the factory , their bodies stacked like cordwood . ( This building , shaped like a coffin and made of cement , was a place where brooms -- good brooms -- had been made for more than twenty years . Now , Kang thought , the building was as dead as its inhabitants . Without fuel , the lathes had fallen silent even as the air grew still and cold . ) Daunting from the outside , the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men , women , and children whose blistered limbs had turned a startling blue in the days before their deaths . As the only medical worker in Tasi-ko , it had been Kang 's responsibility to carry the bodies to where they now lay , awaiting burial in the spring . Until he 'd seen the trucks winding toward the village , Kang had begun to doubt that , by spring , anyone would be left to bury the dead . And if by chance someone was , it seemed unlikely that it would be him or , if it was , that he 'd have the strength to wield a pick and shovel . Now he felt ashamed , ashamed of the bitterness in his thoughts . At some point , perhaps when his wife had died , he 'd surrendered to pessimism . He 'd begun to think that the suffering in Tasi-ko had gone unnoticed , or that it was being ignored because the village was remote and insignificant . These were subversive thoughts , as Kang well knew . If shared , they might weaken the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as subversive . Clearly , the life of a farmer in Tasi-ko was worth as much as that of an engineer in Pyongyang . The proof was there , on the road below . It had simply been a question of time , and the allocation of scarce resources . The army 's presence was a rebuke to his negative thinking . The trucks would have food and medicine in them -- and doctors , real doctors , not medical workers like himself . These were people who had gone to the university in Pyongyang . They 'd know what to do . Whereas he could do nothing . In less than a month he 'd seen the village decimated by an illness whose symptoms were so violent and strange that , on hearing of them , a doctor had been sent to Tasi-ko from the Institute for Infectious Diseases in the capital . The doctor had been very short and very old -- a compact little nut of a man with large , yellow incisors . He chain-smoked imported cigarettes and talked in short bursts , punctuated by long silences . Kang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be important . But even so , Kang did n't like him . In the end the doctor examined a dozen patients , four of whom had since died . He made notes of their symptoms and questioned Kang about the progress of the disease . He took blood samples from four of the villagers , and arranged for two of the dead to be wrapped in sheets and taken to the capital for autopsies . As the doctor was leaving , Kang asked what he should do in his absence , but the old man did n't answer him . He lit another cigarette and , leaning out the window of his car , pointed toward the building where the dead were kept . " All this , " he said , " Spanish Lady . Spanish Lady did this ! " Though it was n't Kang 's place to contradict a senior physician from Pyongyang , he could n't help himself . As the car began to pull away he jogged beside it . " But , Doctor -- this is not correct ! We have n't had any visitors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , and Kang shouted out : " What can I do ? " The old man turned in his seat for a last look , and shook his head , leaving Kang in the road , thinking he was mad . But that did n't matter now . The old man was back . He 'd come with medicine -- and bulldozers to bury the dead . Kang knew that he should hurry down the hill to help the soldiers . But the cold made him hesitate . Whatever cures the army might bring , whatever food they might bring , firewood was nearly impossible to come by , and it would be a waste to have climbed so far , in such cold , only to return empty-handed . Leaving the ridge for the wooded hillside a hundred yards away , he pounced on a small tree and , kneeling in the snow , sawed furiously at its trunk with his little folding saw . The pitch was sticky and gummed the teeth of the blade , but in the end the tree keeled over , and Kang scrambled to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base of the pine , he turned and hurried back up to the ridge , dragging the tree behind him on its leash . At the crest of the ridge he stopped to catch his breath , and what he saw puzzled him . About a kilometer south of town half of the convoy -- three trucks and a flatbed -- pulled to a halt in the middle of the road and waited . Meanwhile , the other trucks continued on their way , rumbling into and ... through the village . Except for the jeep . The jeep pulled into the little square that , in better days , had served as a marketplace for local farmers . Idling in the cold , it drew the villagers like iron filings to a magnet , though Kang knew what the real attraction was : the promise of medicine , food , and news . He started moving again , but then he hesitated . The convoy south of town had not moved . Its trucks sat in the middle of the road , their engines stilled , while soldiers stood around , smoking cigarettes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the scene was being repeated . The second half of the convoy rolled to a stop about a kilometer past Tasi-ko . Soldiers jumped from the backs of the trucks , then stood and waited . It was a disquieting sight , even from so far above . The village was being quarantined . And though it disturbed Kang to see Tasi-ko isolated in this way , he began to see the wisdom of it . Whatever the pestilence might be , it would have to be contained . Betrayed by China , battered by floods , and beset by famine , his country would be hard put to withstand yet another disaster . Once again he was thinking dangerously , seditiously . But what he thought was the truth . And a second truth was that he was very tired and , being tired , he lacked the energy to " weed the garden of his mind . " This was the metaphor that Kang had been taught in the army , when he 'd served for six years as a medical officer in a reconnaissance unit at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still others were vipers . Constant vigilance was needed to correctly identify each . But " constant vigilance " required more energy than Kang could spare . Over the years , he 'd lost too much -- his leg to a land mine , his wife to sickness . For the past week he 'd eaten little more than wild grass , and now -- now , his mind was anything but a garden . It was a ruin , and he just did n't care . What more could the world do to him ? Suddenly , an electric bullhorn crackled and whined in the square . Kang strained to hear what was being said , but as the words floated up the hillside , they softened in a way that made them impossible to understand . But he could see their effect : repelled now , the people withdrew from the jeep and , one by one , disappeared into their homes . Before long the village -- a cluster of decrepit wooden houses surrounded by fallow fields and an abandoned factory -- looked eerily empty . Only then did the jeep pull away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled north to rendezvous at the second roadblock . First a quarantine , Kang thought , and now a curfew . But in the middle of the day ? Why ? And what about the doctors ? Where were they ? Kang 's face , impassive for so long , crumpled into a frown . What he was seeing did not make sense , and his instincts told him to be wary . And though it seemed unlikely that anyone would notice him from so far below , he removed the red muffler that his wife had made with the yarn from an unraveled sweater . He tucked the muffler inside his jacket and sat down on the tree that he 'd been dragging . Then he snapped a twig from one of its branches and began to chew it as he watched the road . Over the course of the next hour nothing much happened . Except for soldiers and the barricades , the Pyongyang road remained empty . Too empty . Never busy , it was now entirely deserted . Not a single car , truck , or pedestrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were other barricades , farther from town , and that the ones he saw served a purpose far different than he 'd imagined . They were n't there to keep the traffic out . They were there to keep the people in . Kang 's heart wobbled in his chest . And then , abruptly , there was movement . As if on cue , soldiers at both ends of the village scrambled to the side of the road , where they hunkered down in ditches . Kang did n't know what to make of it -- even when he saw the plane , coming over the mountains . Like every other plane he 'd ever seen , this was a military aircraft . Its aluminum skin was a dull brown that seemed , almost , to absorb the sunlight . Kang watched the plane as it drew closer to Tasi-ko , its engines rumbling in the frigid air . Suddenly , a piece of the fuselage detached and fell , tumbling , toward the village . Kang did n't believe what he was seeing . The plane banked to the east , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unthinking , jumped to his feet . He opened his mouth to shout or to scream -- at the plane , at the village , at the soldiers -- but it was too late . The world pulsed . There was a flash of light , and a low whummmmp that sucked the air out of the sky . For an instant Kang saw an incinerating wave of light roll outward in every direction from Tasi-ko . Then a tidal wave of heat smashed against the ridge , bowling him over . He gasped to breathe , gasped again , then panicked with the realization that there was no air in the air -- only heat , and the smell of burning hair . They 're killing everyone , he thought . Frantic , he slipped on the ice and landed hard , flat on his back . A shower of light went off behind his eyes and something cracked , deep inside his head . Kang 's vision shuddered and the last thing he saw , before his senses shut down , was Tasi-ko , shuddering in a sea of flames . When he woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the smell of smoke . His face felt as if the skin had been peeled from his cheeks , and the back of his head was pounding as rhythmically as a drum . With the fingers of his right hand he touched the place where the pain was , just behind his ear , and instantly drew back , shocked by the lump that was bleeding there . For a moment his stomach swayed , and it seemed as if his chest was about to turn inside out . But nothing happened . Machines growled in the distance , off to the left and far below . Below . Where was he ? Slowly , Kang sat up and looked around . He was on a ridge , just like the one above Tasi-ko . The ground was slick with ice , and here and there tree stumps poked from the snow . Turning toward the noise , he saw bulldozers moving back and forth across a field of rubble , lit by the headlamps of half a dozen trucks . He was on an overlook , above a construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been gathering wood and ... The pain in his head made it impossible to think . A stream of broken images meandered around the inside of his skull : a brown plane ; a jeep ; his wife 's face -- fire . He needed a doctor , and instinctively he called out to the men below . But , of course , they could n't hear him . Struggling to his feet , he made his way down the hillside , calling out against the bulldozers ' rumbling noise . A spray of small stones and rocks preceded him in a little avalanche and , as he drew closer , he saw for the first time that the construction crew consisted entirely of soldiers , and that the soldiers were wearing gas masks . Strange . He was halfway down the ridge when one of the soldiers saw him and began to shout . Relieved , Kang paused to catch his breath and , standing amid a clutch of boulders , waved and shouted back . Then a peculiar thing happened . The soldier raised his Kalashnikov to his chest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peppering the air between them with short bursts of gunfire that sounded , almost , like the telegraphic code that ships use at sea . And as that happened , the moment expanded . Suddenly , Kang knew where he was -- which was just where he seemed to be : on the ridge above Tasi-ko . And then he remembered : they 're killing everyone . The boulder beside him was spitting stones as 9mm slugs slapped into it . Even so , Kang did n't move . His eyes were in the distance , ignoring the soldiers as they ran toward him , staring instead at the cratered wasteland that lay , smoking , in the headlights of the trucks . Tasi-ko was gone . The realization frightened him even more than the guns , frightened him in a way that he had never felt before . Because this was a fear that had no point of origin or focus . It came from within and without at the same time . It was terror , pure and oceanic , and it radiated from him like heat from a fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrambling up the hillside from rock to rock , moving from one shadow to another . Behind him , his pursuers gave ground as they moved deeper into the cold , dark , and unfamiliar hills , swinging their flashlights in great , useless arcs . Soon it was obvious that they had no idea which way he 'd gone and that , in fact , they were beginning to worry about their own whereabouts . Still , Kang kept moving . Far from feeling the usual clumsiness of his wooden leg , he covered the ground with immaculate economy , invisible as a shadow in the night . And though his lungs were on fire and his quadriceps were drained , he moved higher and higher into the mountains until the soldiers ' voices dwindled to nothing and the bulldozers fell silent . After four or five hours in the freezing cold , his shirt was soaked with sweat and his stump was a bloody mess . His fingers were frozen , his skull was fractured , and his face was a blister . The parts of him that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . But he kept on moving , and eventually he found a sort of track that led downhill . Following it , he emerged from the mountains just as the night grayed toward dawn . Finding himself beside the Victory Road , he followed the highway without thinking or caring where it went . The truth was : he had nowhere to go and , clearly , he was dying . The likelihood was that whatever energy he had left would soon disappear . He 'd sit down for a rest , and that would be that . If he was lucky , there would be a tree , and he could lean back against it ... close his eyes ... and just let go . He looked forward to dying that way , like an old monk , dreaming the world . Indeed , the image lifted his spirits and , as he walked beside the road , he kept his eyes open for the perfect tree . The death-tree . His tree . But it was nowhere to be found . Morning molted into afternoon , the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into evening . Night fell , the temperature dropped , and still Kang kept walking . So it went for a second day , and then a third . Instinctively , and without thinking , Kang trudged toward the one place he knew as well as the environs of Tasi-ko . This was Korea 's Demilitarized Zone . A closely watched no-man's-land that runs for more than a hundred miles , stretching from the Yellow Sea to the Sea of Japan , the DMZ was at once a nature preserve and a killing floor . Honeycombed with tunnels and bristling with land mines , it was a ribbon of green in a sea of mud and ice -- tranquil , forested , and dangerous . Gateway to the Vampire South . Perhaps he would find his tree there .
