<p> Getting advice is n't the problem when you 're shopping for a personal computer as a family holiday gift . <p> The world is filled with computer experts who know just what you need . Trouble is , especially for first-time computer buyers , these experts sound as if they are giving out recipes for building a small nuclear device . <p> They tell you about 32-bit addressable microprocessors , 64k caches , CD-ROMS and v42 bis compatible modems . <p> If these terms are as familiar to you as the words of your favorite holiday song , you do n't need - and probably do n't want - this advice . But if you just want to buy a computer that will let you write a few letters , run a spreadsheet and play a game or two , we should talk . <p> Do n't look for a course on computing here . This is for someone who wants quick advice on how to buy a computer . <p> Let 's divide your big task into little chunks , with answers to some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need ? <p> A. Surprisingly , it does n't matter that much . Most computers are assembled with parts from various manufacturers . There is little danger of getting a poorly made computer if you buy it from a reputable , local computer store . <p> Q. Should I buy an Apple Macintosh or an IBM compatible ? <p> A. Once upon a time , Apples were easier to use and IBM compatibles were better bargains . But the difference is blurring . Now both are fairly easy to use and offer good bargains . It is best to buy a system like the one you use at work or the one used by your friends . <p> Q. What do you recommend ? <p> A. The bargains now are in the group of IBM compatibles with the 80386SX processor chip . Do n't worry about what sets that chip apart from others . Just know that it 's modern enough so your computer wo n't become a high-tech antique overnight . You can buy this model , complete with almost everything you need , for as little as $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of computers with older chips - the 8088 , 8086 and 80286 . <p> Q. The ads just confuse me - can you help ? <p> A. Read them with the same care you 'd use with automobile advertising . <p> For instance , some stores advertise stripped-down computers - without a monitor , hard disk or much memory - and put a low-ball price on the ad . When you compare prices , make sure you compare systems with the same accessories . <p> Q. What extras do I need ? <p> A. Look for a computer that comes with a monitor , big hard disk , plenty of memory , some computer programs and two floppy drives . You can save money by buying everything you need in one package . <p> Q. What does that stuff do ? <p> A. The monitor is like a small television . As you 'll spend a lot of time looking at it , make sure it 's easy on your eyes . You need a color VGA monitor . Avoid CGA and EGA monitors - two lesser grades . A VGA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Computer memory is confusing . There are two types , both measured in megabytes . <p> One type is storage memory offered by a hard disk . That type of memory is like a closet - long-term storage for programs and data . Make sure you get a lot . The more megabytes , the more room . Get at least 60 megabytes . Like the closet in your bedroom , hard disks fill up fast . <p> The other type of memory is temporary storage called RAM : Random Access Memory . Instead of the long-term storage of a hard disk , RAM is short-term memory used to juggle data while the computer is turned on . More RAM lets a computer handle tougher tasks . Get at least two megabytes of RAM - four is even better . <p> The disk operating system is a program that gives your computer the basic information it needs to work . Your computer should come with this program - called DOS - already installed . That way , all you 'll need to do is plug it in and turn it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that 's the one you get - it 's a lot better than earlier versions . <p> Floppy disk drives read information into a computer . When you buy a program , it will come on floppy disks . You stick them in a drive to copy them to your hard disk . There are two major sizes of floppy disks , 5 1/4 inches and 3.5 inches , so you need a drive in each size . <p> Q. Should I buy a computer through the mail ? <p> A. You can save a few bucks by ordering from a mail-order company . But it may be a poor bargain . If you buy at a local store , you can go to real live humans for help . If you get a lemon , you can put it in your car and take it back . Big computer stores sell at prices close to mail order . <p> Q. What sort of programs will I need to get started ? <p> A. Several computers such as the IBM PS/1 and Radio Shack 's Tandy 1000s come with easy-to-use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll want to add programs later . But get familiar with these basic programs first , before shelling out at least $ 400 for more-complex programs . <p> Q. Wo n't I need a printer ? <p> A. Yes , but you can postpone buying one for a few months while you learn how the computer works . If you do buy one now , consider one of the improved models of ink jet printers . Letters are sprayed on the paper by tiny ink jets , producing a page that looks like it was printed on an expensive laser printer . You 'll pay about $ 500 . Two of the best are made by Hewlett Packard and Canon . <p> Compiled from staff , news service and published reports . <p> Bill Husted 's column and other computer news and features are available on Access Atlanta , The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 's electronic information service .
