Even with the Dow Jones Industrial Average flying high over 8000 , few on Wall Street say they expect a crash anytime soon . Indeed , the world is a prosperous , friendly place these days , and the coffee-shop buzz is , " How do I get in the market ? " not " How do I get out ? " But make no mistake , the stock market could crash again . Mechanically , there is nothing in place to guarantee that the Dow wo n't fall 1000 points by lunch and another 800 points in the afternoon . Get real ! An 1,800-point decline today would be the same 23% drop that occurred on Oct. 19 , 1987 . And that plunge took place after the Dow had already fallen 17% from its speculative peak three months earlier , which was 10 years ago this month . An exact recurrence would put the Dow at 5200 by mid-October . <P> Of course things are much different . The economy is on a firmer footing . And since that horrendous crash , much has been done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms and mutual-fund companies have invested billions of dollars in technology so that they can answer all the calls and execute all the trades on the busiest days . The New York Stock Exchange , which has never traded even 1 billion shares in a day , currently has the capacity to trade 3 billion shares . On the computerized Nasdaq stock market , capacity was a mere 250 million shares a day in 1987 and is now 1 billion shares , headed for 1.5 billion shares by the end of the year . <P> The N.Y.S.E . has adopted a flight of funny-named trading curbs : " collars " prevent certain computerized stock trading when the Dow is up or down 50 points in a day ; the " sidecar " rule gives small orders priority when the market is moving briskly ; and " circuit breakers " halt trading for 30 minutes when the Dow is down 350 points and for one hour when it is down 550 points . The curbs ensure that investors have time to think . But at the end of the day , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brokers , the fund companies and the exchanges are ready to accommodate them  --  so look out below . <P> Again , this is n't to be taken as a crash prediction . When the bull market finally ends , which it must , it certainly does n't have to be in calamity . The more natural turn would be to a slow , grinding bear market , in which stocks fall some 20% to 30% over a year or longer . No panic . Just a lot of selling , most likely hinged to a downturn in the economy . <P> But it 's worth noting that even with all the adjustments since the ' 87 crash , another meltdown is quite possible . And that has n't been lost on a number of institutions quietly preparing for the worst . Some of the nation 's largest mutual-fund companies , like Vanguard and Fidelity , have detailed battle plans should the market fall apart . Brokerage firms seem less frenetic but no less prepared , as is the government . Maybe these parties are n't as sanguine about the markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
