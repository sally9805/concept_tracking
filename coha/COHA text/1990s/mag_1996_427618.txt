Section : Special report This Cobra attack helicopter was built from surplus parts . The Pentagon sells millions of them a year . Many fall into the wrong hands . <p> To the uninitiated , " military surplus " generally conjures up images of old web belts , clanky canteens and threadbare fatigues sold in funky stores at the edge of fading Army bases . But to a sophisticated few , it means something very different : aircraft , weapons and weapons parts worth billions of dollars . Most taxpayers do n't know it , but every year the Pentagon declares all kinds of equipment  --  attack helicopters , rocket launchers , even Stealth fighter parts  --  " surplus , " or unneeded . Then , through a little-known network of sales offices at military bases , the stuff is offered for purchase to the highest bidder . <p> A three-month investigation by U.S. News in collaboration with CBS 's 60 Minutes has documented serious problems with the surplus sales program . Relying on internal Pentagon records , Customs Service documents and interviews with scores of federal agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons and parts that should have been rendered militarily harmless before sale were not , where weapons that should have been designated for destruction were not and where key weapons parts that should have been prevented from reaching foreign buyers were not . This system " on its best day is morally embarrassing to the government , " says William Portanova , an assistant U.S. attorney in California heading a Justice Department task force investigating the program . " And it never has a best day . It is absolutely a disaster of the highest magnitude . " <p> No Pentagon officials responsible for this program were willing to be interviewed on the record . These are the principal findings of the U.S. News  --  60 Minutes inquiry : <p> Foreign buyers are purchasing many of the Pentagon 's high-tech surplus military parts and shipping them overseas , hiding them in seagoing containers under tons of metal scrap , seizure records show . Customs officials say Iran and Iraq are active buyers , but by far the biggest customer is China . Among the items seized from Chinese " scrap dealers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , radar systems , electron tubes for Patriot guided missiles , even F-117A Stealth fighter parts . Many of these parts , sold as " surplus , " were brand new . <p> So overloaded is the Pentagon 's surplus sales system that some offices responsible for disposing of the materiel have suffered significant breakdowns . At an Air Force base in Georgia , the Pentagon 's surplus sales office lost track of $39 million in materiel . Today , no one can say where the stuff went . <p> The sheer volume of surplus materiel generated by the Pentagon 's downsizing is one reason for the system overload , but the modern Pentagon 's insistence on profitability is another . Last year , the surplus sales system generated $302 million , and it is one of the few Pentagon programs capable of covering its own costs . A Pentagon E-mail message written in April 1994 illustrates clearly the premium placed on profits by senior military officials . Authored by a top-level official and addressed to all surplus sales directors on the East Coast , the memo is blunt : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are : 1 . Profits . 2 . Profits . 3 . Profits . 4 . Profits , " the official wrote . Priority No. 6 on his list was " accountability . " No. 7 was rendering lethal weaponry harmless . <p> Surplus Pentagon weapons are regularly traded away by Army and Navy museums scattered around the country , and some have been responsible for questionable if not illegal activities ( story , Page 39 ) . A federal law allows the museums to trade tanks , jet fighters , and attack helicopters to private citizens for other vehicles or " services . " Two museums are under federal criminal investigations for such activities . <p> Within the cloistered world of the Pentagon , the problems of properly disposing of surplus weapons are nothing new , although the public has been kept largely in the dark . Surplus weapons sales are overseen by a Pentagon office called the Defense Logistics Agency , which manages all the military 's supplies and equipment . The DLA has spent much of the past two decades trading barbs with the four military services about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been virtually nonexistent . Nearly a decade ago , an internal memorandum signed by William Taft , then the deputy secretary of defense , leveled a startling charge . " A joint U.S. Customs-Pentagon investigation has confirmed , " Taft wrote , " that the defense disposal system is a source of supply for arms traffickers . " Since then the number of surplus weapons and critical parts has increased , and the problems have only worsened . <p> Guns and money . How much Pentagon weaponry is getting into the wrong hands is impossible to know , but it is happening , law enforcement officials say . When a Hell 's Angels methamphetamine lab was raided in California last year , police also found military weaponry : three working machine guns and an M-79 grenade launcher . The grenade launcher was traced to a Pentagon surplus sales outlet in Crane , Ind . That same outlet had sold 70 of the launchers in 1989 . Pentagon documents certified that the launchers had been cut into scrap ; in fact , only their firing pins had been filed down . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 41 months in prison for illegal possession of 10 unregistered machine guns ; the man had bought the weapons through Pentagon surplus sales and welded them up to make them work . The weapons should have been mutilated so they could never work . <p> Smuggling is an even bigger concern . A 16-month Customs Service investigation that ended earlier this year resulted in the interception of surplus military parts worth $157 million . Foreign countries can use these parts to resupply their own armies , to find out how American weapons work or to build their own weapons , avoiding years of costly development . <p> Despite a handful of successes prosecuting those who abuse the Pentagon 's surplus sale system , federal officials who have tried to plug the holes in it are frustrated and angry . A few Pentagon officials have found themselves demoted or reassigned for being too aggressive . Federal task forces have been quietly disbanded with few results while prosecutors who take on inquiries involving illegal surplus-weapons sales say they find the criminal justice system unable or unwilling to cope . " Whenever we tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Justice Department said ' No , ' " said Jim Wiggins , a former U.S. attorney in Georgia who investigated surplus-weapons sales . <p> In theory , the system for surplus disposal is simple . Whether it is a part from a jet fighter or a pair of socks , once an item is designated as surplus , it is trucked to a warehouse-cum-sales lot known as a Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office , or DRMO . There all surplus items are checked in and sorted . Then they are offered free to other government agencies and to museums and nonprofits . What 's left after that is sold to the public at auctions where buyers must submit sealed bids . <p> Before that can happen legally , however , weapons and weapons parts must be " demilitarized , " or rendered militarily harmless . Machine guns , for instance , are " demilled "  --  the Pentagon term of art  --  by being cut into six pieces , reducing them to scrap metal . Many electronic parts are demilled by crushing or chopping  --  again , reducing them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance  --  can be demilled by removing key parts . In such instances , buyers get a functional piece of equipment but one that has no military application . Many items , like desks , require no demilitarization . Other things , like parts of military aircraft that have commercial use , can be sold in the United States without being demilitarized , but buyers must obtain licenses to ship them overseas . <p> How or whether something should be demilitarized is determined by its " demil code , " which is normally assigned when a piece of equipment is purchased by the Pentagon . In theory , the codes should reflect how militarily sensitive an item is , and the code for a specific item should rarely be changed . Theory , however , has little to do with practice . Three years ago , for instance , a team of nine demilitarization experts went to Battle Creek , Mich. , the home of the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service . That office is the headquarters of the surplus sales program , responsible for the operation of the 170 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team reviewed the demilitarization codes on 2.6 million pieces of equipment in the 14 million-item inventory . The team found that 45 percent of the demilitarization codes were wrong and that about half the items were coded too leniently . This meant that weapons and weapons parts that should have been rendered militarily harmless before being offered for sale were not . Some .38-caliber revolvers , for instance , were coded demil " A "  --  the same as tables and chairs . Other , far more sensitive equipment was similarly miscoded , the team found . Electronics that guide bombs and aircraft gunnery , sensitive communication and navigation gear , cryptographic equipment , even hardware that allows U.S. fighter jets to jam antiaircraft missiles  --  in those categories , the team found between 80 percent and 90 percent of coding was wrong . In nine tenths of the errors discovered in this instance , the codes applied were too lenient . <p> Such mistakes have consequences . When Pentagon investigator Dave Barrington checked a DRMO outlet at Fort Benning , Ga. , for example , he found three complete TOW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code allowing them to be bought by anyone in the United States . Says Barrington : " You can build yourself an army out of this stuff that 's miscoded . " <p> Defense Department officials blame the military services for the miscoding , since the services assign the codes . The services do n't make coding a high priority because anything dealing with " surplus " is a far cry from their main mission , warfare . <p> The profit motive is also a factor . The more fully-operational weapons the Pentagon sells , the more money it makes . And the Pentagon is interested in selling . To encourage sales , in fact , the Defense Department has set up a Web page on the Internet http//:www.drms.dla.mil listing every piece of equipment that has entered the surplus inventory . Anyone with a computer can call up the listings , type in " missiles " or " bombs " or other hardware and see what 's available . <p> U.S. News did just that . After browsing the Web site at length , a reporter gave Defense Department experts a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the demilitarization codes for each were correct . The experts found that dozens of items had been wrongly coded . " Bomb , gen. purpose , " for instance , had been given the same demilitarization code as a desk chair  --  " A. " Similarly miscoded were " sight , rocket launcher , " " controller , missile , " and " missile guidance set . " All should have been coded " D "  --  for destruction . " This is the computer memory for a Tomahawk cruise missile ! " one of the Pentagon experts exclaimed , pointing to one item on the reporter 's shopping list . " This should be classified ! This is the brains of the missile ! " <p> Even when the Pentagon codes are correct , there is no guarantee that weapons and weapons parts will be demilitarized properly . Curt Murphree , a former Pentagon investigator , recalls one visit to a DRMO near Texarkana , Texas , where he watched a worker trying to cut through the gun barrel of an M-60 tank . " The poor kid had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't cut hot butter . " <p> System overload . At the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Offices around the country , workers and managers say they have been so overloaded with equipment from the massive military drawdown  --  in recent years , the DRMOs have taken in more than $20 billion worth of materiel annually  --  that the demilitarization process was bound to have problems . Easily the biggest occurred at Robins Air Force Base near Macon , Ga . So much property came into the DRMO there three years ago that the system collapsed , and workers lost track of $39,784,198 in surplus equipment  --  about one fifth of their inventory . " The DRMO lost total accountability of ... surplus property , " an investigative board 's report concluded . <p> Investigators assigned to examine the problems at Robins found that the Pentagon 's DRMOs had developed what they called an " expedited processing " program . To speed things up , a Robins DRMO manager told investigators , she falsified demilitarization statements , registering weapons and other equipment as scrap that was later made available for sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One day in 1994 , an Air Force investigator jogging on the base saw a surplus-parts dealer named Hobart Burton carrying an electronic device from the DRMO to his truck . The investigator looked into the truck , jotted down the stock number of the item and checked it later . He found that the device should have been demilitarized but had not been . Not long after that , a team of Air Force and Pentagon agents visited the Burton Electronics warehouse in nearby Montezuma , Ga. , where they found more electronic weapons parts that had not been demilitarized . The agents retrieved a pile of weapons pieces and aircraft parts that had cost the government $40 million when new . Burton said he had bought most of the materiel from other dealers ; investigators believe much of it was sold by the Robins DRMO as scrap  --  for 16 cents a pound . It is not illegal to buy surplus materiel that was improperly demilled , and Burton was not charged with any crime . He is now trying to get his money back . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chinese-owned scrap company was legally buying surplus materiel from Burton and from the Robins DRMO . Further inquiries revealed a score of Chinese dealers operating from coast to coast . Although no proof developed that they acted as agents for China , that did raise concerns . In a memo to his Chinese boss in California , the buyer in Georgia called Robins " the candy store . " The base , he wrote , " will fill our needs into the next century , " according to an investigator who has seen the note . <p> The Robins case had all kinds of reverberations . It led investigators to the discovery of a commercial listing service that offers thousands of military surplus weapons and weapons parts . The listing , called the Inventory Locator Service or ILS , is used worldwide by dealers in aircraft parts to advertise their inventories . Surplus dealers also use it to advertise weapons and weapons parts , all of which is perfectly legal too . <p> Fallout . The echoes from the Robins case would eventually be felt clear across the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a straight-talking businessman who runs a thriving helicopter-repair business about 40 miles south of Missoula . Garlick had modified UH-1 Huey helicopters for logging and construction use . Since the Cobra was a sleek and powerful follow-on to the Huey , he thought it would make a good logger . Garlick obtained an FAA license to build one for logging , firefighting or movie-making purposes . <p> When armed , the Cobra is one of the deadliest military attack vehicles ever invented . Before it is sold as surplus , it must be demilitarized . The demilitarization manual states that Cobra bodies must be cut into at least three parts and that their " airframe must be mutilated by destroying attaching structure by cutting , chopping , tearing , shredding , crushing or smelting to the degree that aircraft will be unfit for repair or flight . " Garlick and other helicopter builders , however , knew that usable parts were plentiful , even at DRMOs . Says Garlick , who has amassed a huge store of Cobra parts , " If they were built once , I can rebuild it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In September 1994 , a flatbed truck pulled into the DRMO at Robins carrying three Cobra bodies that looked as if they had not been properly demilled . Air Force investigators questioned the truck driver , who said the Cobras had been purchased at a DRMO in Groton , Conn. , and were headed for a warehouse in Joshua , Texas , owned by a man named Alan Sparks . " I do n't know why you are so excited , " the man reportedly said . " Sparks has 60 or 70 of these things . " <p> Original crates . Sparks actually had 88 Cobra fuselages , which he hoped to use for logging . He also had the parts to go with them  --  the rotor blades , rocket tubes , gun pods , missile launchers , and weapons controllers , according to Pentagon records . " None of the items were demilled correctly , " a Pentagon memo states . " Some items were in original packing crates . " <p> Word of Sparks 's covey of Cobras shocked Jim Wiggins , the top federal prosecutor for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A tall , sandy-haired man with a deliberate manner , Wiggins had won a Silver Star in Vietnam for piloting a Cobra gunship in a hazardous rescue mission . At the time of the Sparks discovery , Wiggins was overseeing something called the Middle Georgia Task Force , which consisted of military investigators and special agents of the Customs Service and the FBI . The task force had been set up after the $40 million retrieval of property from Hobart Burton . <p> The other person upset by Sparks 's Cobras was Ron Garlick , in Montana , who telephoned the Pentagon to see what was going on . The call was lateraled to investigator Dave Barrington . Garlick was concerned over the Sparks seizures , he said , because he , too , was building Cobras  --  and he saw no reason to give his up . According to Barrington 's notes , Garlick said he " had a significant amount of intact weapons and weapons systems . " Garlick confirms this . " Mine was fully armed , " he says of his chopper . " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there shooting coyotes with them . " <p> Garlick did n't want trouble . The government could have his Cobra weapons , he said , if they " want to buy them . " Barrington finished scribbling his notes , thanked Garlick and hung up . <p> The fate of the Cobras would hang in the balance for months , as a bitter wrangle ensued inside both the Pentagon and the Justice Department . Investigators , federal agents , demilitarization officers and prosecutor Wiggins pushed for seizure of the Cobras . But the Army , which owns most of the choppers , resisted , as did Col. Charles Masters , who was in charge of surplus disposal . Feelings ran so high that Wiggins hauled Masters before a grand jury . Masters says : " Quite frankly , I thought I was close to being charged . With what , I have no idea . " Ultimately , Wiggins prevailed , and the government seized the helicopters and parts from Sparks . But as agents began to plan raids on Garlick and other owners of Cobras , the Justice Department brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might authorize them was just too murky . On September 25 of this year , the FBI sent a letter to the Pentagon advising that 23 Cobras belonging to private citizens had been " discovered during several FBI investigations . " ( U.S. News has located two more . ) Should the Pentagon choose to take " corrective action , " the FBI letter advised , that would be agreeable to local U.S. attorneys . One senior Pentagon investigator calls this the FBI 's " Pontius Pilate " letter . " They 're washing their hands of the whole thing , " he says . <p> Security threats . As worrisome as the Cobras may be to law enforcement , agents say that the greater threat to national security is the shipping of weaponry overseas . In September 1994 , about the time the flatbed-truck driver with the three Cobras was pulling into Robins , Pentagon investigator Curt Murphree got word that a California company named Cal Industries was loading 14 seagoing containers at the Pentagon DRMO in San Antonio . The contents were listed as 240 tons of electronic scrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sensitive weapons equipment , got Customs Service agents to stop the containers and pry them open . What they found were thousands of top-secret encryption devices , hard-cased field computers used for sending coded communications , as well as classified radio transmitter-receivers . None had been properly demilitarized . There was also a pile of banged-up Wang computers , but many still had their hard drives , and two had 5-inch floppy disks in them . One disk was marked " Classified SCI " ( special compartmented information ) . The other was marked " Top Secret , SCI . Contains Special Intelligence . " Murphree checked and found that the equipment had come from the most secure sector of Kelly Air Force Base , known as " Security Hill . " " None of this material , " Murphree said , " should have ever left the DRMO . " The equipment 's intended destination was Hong Kong , a common transshipment point for goods bound for China . Kelly Air Force Base took it all back . No charges were filed against Cal Industries , which had bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Attorney Wiggins , " the way we handle this stuff so recklessly , it 's hard to pin anyone down or hold them liable . " <p> For 16 months , U.S. Customs ran an investigation that targeted surplus smugglers , says John Hensley , the special agent in charge of Customs Service investigations in Los Angeles . Dubbed " Operation Overrun , " the investigation resulted in nine seizures of $157 million worth of parts bound for China , Hong Kong , Vietnam , the Philippines , Taiwan and elsewhere . None of the items seized had been licensed for export . Included in their overseas-bound shipments were radar systems , electronic-warfare black boxes , and some bizarre items  --  10,000 new **27;1422;TOOLONG suits headed to Ukraine . <p> In one case , records show , 28 boxes of tank and howitzer parts , valued at $800,000 , were found buried inside a container beneath automotive parts . In another , bound for Shanghai , agents found 37 separate inertial guidance devices for the F-117A Stealth fighter and F-111 bomber . New , the devices had cost the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible said they could not explain how the devices had been sold intact . <p> Of the many countries pursuing Pentagon surplus weapons , China is clearly running hardest . " China is the most aggressive country worldwide in the acquisition of military hardware , " says customs agent Hensley . " Anything that seems to us to be mid-tech , or slightly out of date , is high tech to them . They can leapfrog R &D; costs . They either reverse-engineer this stuff , or if they get enough , they just use them . " <p> Operations . Customs agents are now convinced that a Chinese surplus-smuggling operation began as many as 15 years ago , when a flood of Chinese men and women entered the United States , established themselves as residents and then set up shop . Operating with little more than a fax machine and a bank account , they apparently form the lowest tier of the Chinese espionage network , agents say . <p> The buyers hunt surplus sales outlets for military electronic parts . When they find what they want , they bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $50,000 or $100,000 for scrap are not unusual . Sometimes they buy huge piles of scrap knowing that valuable pieces of electronics equipment are included , or they share purchases with legitimate scrap dealers . One dealer with Chinese affiliations , says investigator Barrington , " was the high bidder on every piece of scrap electronic equipment on the East Coast . " <p> In a year and a half of intense investigation of these buyers , the Customs Service has never found a smoking gun  --  a written shopping list from overseas , or anything that could link particular Chinese scrap buyers to Beijing or its defense agencies . " I think the reason for that , besides good intelligence tradecraft , is that they do n't need to communicate directly , " says a customs agent . " These people have been doing this for 15 years . They know exactly what their country wants . " <p> Last March , after 16 months of dogging leads , the Customs Service abandoned Operation Overrun . The agency had run out of time and money ; the investigation had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in seizures , only two criminal cases had been brought . A man named Richard Li had been intercepted smuggling sensitive electronic gear to Hong Kong and pleaded guilty to smuggling . A second man is currently under arrest , and his partner is on the run . Customs Agent Hensley says the investigation clearly put pressure on the network of Chinese traffickers . But he also is certain that once the pressure is off , the smugglers will resume their operations . " We definitely think they 'll spring up again , " he says . " The Chinese can get up to speed to buy the stuff again , and the U.S. is the biggest warehouse in the world . " <p> One of the biggest listings of warehoused arms and arms parts can be found on a system called the Inventory Locator Service . ILS is a business located in Memphis . ILS offers a computerized classified listing to paid subscribers . About 3,000 aircraft-parts sellers and users worldwide subscribe to it , for a fee of several hundred dollars a month . The sellers list their inventories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they browse for purchases . ILS President Bruce Langsen says the computer system is queried about 26,000 times each day . <p> Heavy-duty stuff . Pentagon investigator Barrington remembers vividly the first time he tapped into the ILS database . A former police officer and Army Criminal Investigations Division agent who won a Bronze Star in the gulf war , Barrington went to work for the Defense Logistics Agency in 1994 . Back then , he thought he had a pretty good sense of the international arms market , but the stuff he saw listed in the ILS database disabused him of that . " I ran weapons , machine guns , flamethrowers and components of guided bombs , " he says . " And immediately , I was getting hits ! " <p> A printout Barrington made from his ILS visits is an eye-popper . It runs 26 pages , single spaced , and lists such items as AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles , GBU-10 guided bombs , Maverick missiles , machine guns and grenade launchers . Virtually everything on the list should have been demilitarized , and probably destroyed  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out where the stuff came from , Barrington began to check those items against sales at DRMOs . Checking more than 100 weapons parts advertised on ILS , he found that one fifth had been sold to surplus dealers in just the past three years . All were available in the United States . With more research , he came to believe that the heavy-duty weapons , the bombs and rockets and missiles , had probably been sold legally by the Pentagon to foreign governments , which then sold them as surplus . Brokers using ILS then offered them for sale . <p> Langsen , the ILS president , says he has provided law enforcement agencies access to his company 's computer listings , but he did not know the details of their investigations . Because there are 30 million items listed on the inventory , Langsen contended that searching for weapons is not easy . But when U.S. News gave him the stock number for a grenade launcher , Langsen was able to find it pretty quickly . " From what I have learned in the past 48 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to need to find a better way of combing the database . We are not an armaments database , and we do n't want to become an armaments database . " <p> The U.S. News test of the ILS system shows how easily surplus weapons and weapons parts can be purchased by the public . Using a dummy letterhead , the magazine sent letters to many of the companies listing weapons parts on ILS , requesting price quotes and availability for a variety of weapons and parts . The sellers responded with price quotes for 35 items , ranging from bomb-arming devices to circuit cards for nuclear submarines ' targeting systems to the key components of night-vision scopes . U.S. News even bought some , and , with 60 Minutes , went undercover to talk with surplus dealers . Several dealers said that in buying aircraft parts at DRMOs they often scooped up a lot of other hardware , such as weapons parts . They said they listed it all on ILS hoping that someone would spot it and buy it . <p> Some dealers said they would n't sell weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the system had almost no controls . " I could sell this to you , " one weapons dealer explained , " and you could sell it to someone else , and he could sell it to someone else . " Another dealer wrote that he had the parts we ordered , such as a pilot 's targeting screen , known as a heads-up display , for an F-16 fighter , and had bought them from a DRMO but wanted more information about our company before selling to us . Another offered to ship us a similar part , with no questions asked . <p> One company , Aviarms Support Corp . in Westbury , N.Y. , had a different story . A manager there said the items the company advertises on ILS are held by Israeli , German and Dutch companies for whom it acts as a broker . Many of the U.S. weapons parts came from the surplus stocks of the Israeli and German militaries , he said . Had they been demilitarized ? No , he said , they were all in good working order . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " F-117A fire control memory . " Asked how Israel could have obtained surplus parts for the U.S. F-117 Stealth fighter , the manager checked his computer . Aviarms was brokering it for an Israeli company , which got it from a German company , he said . He could trace it no further . <p> Barrington was outraged by what he found on ILS . His last year at work was consumed with tracking DRMO sales of sensitive weapons parts and trying to get his superiors at the Defense Logistics Agency to take action . He sent E-mail after E-mail message up and down the command chain . " Below are a few examples of obviously Demil-required property offered " at DRMO sales , he wrote in August 1995 : " Payload section , nuclear missile . Warhead components : DRMO San Antonio ... Multipurpose display , F-117A Stealth Fighter : DRMO McClellan Air Force Base , California ... F-111 Navigation and attack computer : McClellan Air Force Base DRMO ... Heads-up display , F-111B fighter-bomber : DRMO Davis-Monthan Air Force Base , Arizona . " <p> Barrington had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the logistics agency , but little was done . There were no seizures , no attempts to recover the items . On June 5 , Barrington sent a final E-mail to his bosses . " Nearing the end of the trail here . I know all of you are very concerned about the OBVIOUS total lack of control of our vital defense technology and hardware , but I ca n't help but wonder after nearly two years of almost DAILY findings such as those above , why the government has not seen fit to attempt to recover ANY of the thousands of sensitive or classified items discovered via ILS . " Barrington then quit to become a Baptist minister . <p> While no senior Defense Department official was willing to meet with U.S. News and 60 Minutes to discuss these problems on the record , a group of knowledgeable middle-level Pentagon and Defense Logistics Agency managers met reporters and confirmed many of their findings . The officials quibbled with some assertions . For instance , they acknowledged that there has been pressure in the past to cut corners to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits , profits , profits " memo . But they also insisted that the new management at the Defense Logistics Agency is not profits driven . The officials blamed the four military services , which control most of the demilitarization codes , for writing the codes too leniently and for failing to change them when errors are pointed out . They said the DRMOs are no longer accepting items with demilitarization codes that had been phased out two years ago . <p> They also said some fixes are in the works . One of their main goals , the officials say , is to set up a centralized demilitarization code office , which will assign and control all the codes , and try to enforce them . The first step toward that , they say , should occur next year . Investigations underway at two Pentagon museums could also result in tightening of the current rules allowing bartering of government aircraft for a variety of services . <p> If those steps happen as planned , they will clearly result in some improvement , but the problem is so great that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" Demil code " assigned . <p> All items and their parts in the U.S. military inventory are assigned demilitarization ( demi ) code letters when they are purchased .

It seemed crazy , but we thought we 'd try . We first obtained a printout from a former Pentagon investigator of the weapons and weapons parts listed on the Inventory Locator Service , a subscriber-only computer database of equipment that aircraft parts dealers have for sale . While most of the 30 million things on ILS are airplane parts , it is possible to search the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons-related items . <p> Using a non-U.S . News letterhead and a rented post office box , we wrote to 32 companies asking for price quotes on such things as Maverick antitank missiles , Sidewinder air-to-air missiles , GBU-10 guided bombs , 40-mm grenade launchers , and flamethrowers . We also asked for quotes on high-tech parts , such as cruise-missile antennas , Hawk missile-launcher parts , night-vision scopes and cryptographic equipment . <p> Some of the items we asked for had been sold at Pentagon surplus sales . Some were listed as classified . All should have been demilitarized and most destroyed . <p> Eighteen of the companies responded with price quotes . We received no quotes on bombs and rockets  --  investigators told us that arms sellers typically prefer dealing with foreign governments or arms dealers . One company said it had bomb arming devices and a control box from an A-4 fighter . The company said it had bought the weapons at surplus sales but wanted to know more about us before selling . The company offering grenade launchers asked how many we wanted . When we said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no price quote . " A flamethrower we sought was for sale for $5,000 , but it was World War II era . We wanted something newer . <p> Our luck was better on the high-tech weapons parts . We got price quotes for 35 items . An antenna for a Harpoon cruise missile was $9,625 . A bomb arming device could be had for $375 . A Cobra attack helicopter weapons controller was $2,500 new , $1,500 used . Tomahawk cruise missile parts were also available . The key part for a night-vision weapons scope , the image intensifier , was $1,100 . An electronic countermeasures test set , classified " confidential , " could be had for $9,780 . <p> In the end , we ordered the night-vision image intensifier , the bomb arming device , an A-4 Fighter navigation circuit card and a missile navigation part that the Pentagon says should definitely be destroyed , not sold . Most arrived courtesy of UPS within a week . We bought the Hawk missile voltage controller over the counter in Texas for $325 in cash , while we chatted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ championship game . As we left , the woman wished us a pleasant day . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Wish list .
