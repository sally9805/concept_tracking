IT 'S ( REALLY , REALLY ) OVER <P> The fat lady has sung . The most spectacularly miserable marriage of the century is officially over . Prince Charles and DIANA are now free to hit the singles bars . Oddly enough , they did n't . On the day the divorce was finalized , Diana went to a party at the English National Ballet , still wearing  --  it was noted in bold type by the press  --  her wedding and engagement rings . Charles ponied up the $31 for the final divorce fee , but he let London retailers know he would no longer be paying his ex 's shopping bills . He spent the week at the family manse , Balmoral , lying low after he was snapped ambling with Camilla Parker Bowles two weeks ago . There were no official divorce souvenirs , but a radio station in Derby had a special breakfast party , with a band playing cheery songs like D-I-V-O-R-C-E . <P> DIVIDED AT BIRTH <P> They 're sisters , they 're Brits , and they 've both been in Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMMA and SOPHIE THOMPSON end . " Emma loves Austen , but I 've never been a great reader . As a child I read Peanuts and Asterix , " says Sophie , who plays the woebegone Miss Bates in Emma and the difficult sister Mary Musgrove in Persuasion . While Emma studied at Cambridge , Sophie left school early , and says her favorite hobby is " gluing things . " Her mother Phyllida Law , also in Emma , is now making a movie with Emma , but the three have no plans to make a film together . " I think people might get very irritated , " says Sophie . " They 'd think , ' Oh , that 's enough of them . Get ' em off ! ' " <P> THE NEW ODD COUPLE <P> BURT BACHARACH , swinging elevator-music king , and ELVIS COSTELLO , curmudgeonly Scot , have teamed up to create a song for the movie Grace of My Heart . It was n't a close collaboration : the tune was written mostly by playing eight-bar snatches into each other 's answering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 've talked about doing an album together , " says Bacharach . " We 've even got a concept . " Costello may have time too ; he keeps hinting that he 's on his last tour . And Bacharach is enjoying a steep rise in grooviness , especially in England . Says Mr. B. : " I think the English have very good taste . " <P> SEEN &; HEARD <P> Now that John Kennedy has his own magazine , George , he can turn the tables on the National Enquirer . He told Oprah , no stranger to tabs herself , that after he printed an interview with the Enquirer 's founding editor Iain Calder , the scurrilous Scot called to complain that he 'd been misquoted . <P> Being sued for a million bucks is no cause for Michael Jackson to observe court decorum . Jackson , who 's in litigation over his nonparticipation in the money-losing Jackson Family Honors , played peekaboo , giggled and danced before testifying . His lawyer claims he was " nervous .
