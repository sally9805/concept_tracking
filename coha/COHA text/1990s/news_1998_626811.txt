<p> Win or lose , the Astros have a way of giving fans their money 's worth and then some . <p> For the second day in a row , it was 11 innings for the price of nine . This time , the local nine ran out of miracles in a game decided more by strategic circumstances than Astro-nomical good fortune . Chicago manager Jim Riggleman won a late-inning chess match with counterpart Larry Dierker as the Cubs edged the Astros 2-1 in 11 innings Sunday before a record regular-season crowd of 52,199 at the Astrodome . <p> On a day when hits were harder to come by than one of the 20,000 Beanie Babies the Astros gave away , the Cubs got the one that counted most - a bases-loaded single by pinch hitter Manny Alexander , who put the Cubs ahead in the 11th and set the stage for closer Rod Beck to atone for his blown save the night before . <p> The Astros put the tying run in scoring position in their final at-bat , but their chances of victimizing Beck two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of running up the score on rookie phenom Kerry Wood . Wood did n't figure into the decision , but he allowed just three hits and struck out 11 in eight impressive innings . <p> The Cubs took two of three games from the Astros in the series , which attracted 149,242 fans , an Astrodome record for a three-game set . The Astros hold an eight-game lead over the Cubs in the National League Central , although the weekend series put a damper on a good homestand during which the Astros won eight of 10 games . <p> " It 's too bad it had to end this way , but this was still a great homestand , " Dierker said . " The Cubs should be proud of themselves and the series they played . We had a hard time just winning one game against them . " <p> None of the three games was decided by more than two runs , and the Astros expect more of the same next weekend when they visit Wrigley Field for three games against the Cubs . <p> " I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dierker said . " They 're going to be fired up , but we could end up taking two of three at their place , just like they did here . " <p> Sunday 's game was a pitcher 's duel few people could have anticipated . Dead arm or not , the Astros expected Wood to hold down the score , just as he did the first time he faced them this year when he tied a major-league record with 20 strikeouts . <p> But the wild card was Astros righthander Sean Bergman , who has been inconsistent since the All-Star break . Bergman picked a good time to rediscover his game , matching Wood zero for zero on the scoreboard . Bergman tied a career high with nine strikeouts and held the Cubs to just four hits in eight innings in one of his best outings of the season . <p> But neither Wood nor Bergman was around when the game was decided by players who were mere spectators when it began . <p> Cubs outfielder Brant Brown led off the 11th with a pinch-hit double off Astros reliever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Mickey Morandini grounded into a fielder 's choice , but Brown delayed the putout long enough to allow Morandini to take his place at second . Powell ( 4-5 ) walked Mark Grace to give the Cubs runners at first and second , and after Sammy Sosa advanced the runners with a groundout to short , Dierker summoned lefthander Trever Miller from the bullpen with lefthanded-hitting Henry Rodriguez due up . <p> Riggleman countered by sending righthanded-hitting Glenallen Hill to the plate as a pinch hitter for Rodriguez . But Dierker had anticipated that move and had Miller intentionally walk Hill to bring lefthanded-hitting Lance Johnson to the plate . <p> " We knew everything that was going to happen , except we did n't know if they were going to let Johnson hit or if they were going to pinch-hit for him , " Dierker said . <p> The final move belonged to Riggleman , who sent the righthanded-batting Alexander to the plate and watched the reserve infielder punch a grounder through the right side of the infield for the game-winning hit . It was the fourth game-winning RBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a pinch hitter this season . <p> " I just did n't get the job done , " Miller said . " I got him to hit a ground ball , but it was still a hit . I 've got to be able to get the out . " <p> Second-guessers might question why Dierker did n't leave Powell in the game , which likely would have kept Riggleman from pinch-hitting for Rodriguez , who struck out twice Sunday and annually ranks among the league leaders in whiffs . Powell was n't one of the doubters . <p> " We did the right thing , " said Powell , who lost for the first time since joining the Astros in a trade at the All-Star break . " In that situation , you have to play the percentages . I could see the reasoning behind it . I was n't making real good pitches . For some reason , I 'm having trouble locating the ball . " <p> That was n't the case for Bergman and Wood , both of whom made it a difficult day to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the last time he faced the Astros , but he managed to overpower them with his blazing fastball and keep them honest with a sharp-breaking slider . <p> " He was throwing 98 mph , " Astros second baseman Craig Biggio said . " He does n't have a dead arm . " <p> The three hits were the lowest total the Astros have accumulated since Wood held them to one questionable hit May 6 . <p> " He was n't quite as good as the last time , but he was still good enough to shut down a pretty good hitting team , " Dierker said . <p> So was Bergman , who showed off his best slider of the season . His only mistake - if you want to call it that - was an 0-1 pitch low in the strike zone that Sosa hit over the right-field wall for his 47th home run of the season in the fourth inning . <p> " When he hit it , I did n't even think it was gone , " Bergman said . " But he 's a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . When he hits a pitch like that out , all you can do is tip your hat to him . " <p> The Astros ' only run came in the fifth when Carl Everett , who was 2-for-3 , led off with a double and scored on Ricky Gutierrez 's sacrifice fly to center . <p> " I was just trying to hit the ball hard somewhere , " Gutierrez said . " I was fortunate to get a ball up in the zone . Wood was tough . He has an outstanding fastball and good breaking stuff . He got big outs when he had to . " <p> . . . <p> Astros ' top crowds <p> Sunday 's game against the Chicago Cubs - a Beanie Baby promotion - produced the Astros ' second-largest crowd ever in the Astrodome . In addition , the series against the Cubs drew 149,242 , setting an Astros record for a three-game series .
