I AM PROPPED UP IN MY HOSPITAL BED , reading the New York Times , as I have every day since the age of ten . Although my eyes are burning , I read . A war criminal has evaded capture in Bosnia . One former Kennedy wife complains of the manner in which she was dispatched ; another stands loyally alongside her philandering husband . The Dow Jones may soon break eight thousand . The Red Sox have beaten the Yankees . I can only manage the headlines , but still I read . <p> A doctor enters . <p> " So , Mr. Gloucester , " he says , setting his hand , not on my shoulder , but on the bed next to my shoulder . Then he reaches behind him for the chair . <p> " First name 's Gloucester , " I tell him . " Remember ? " <p> We had this conversation yesterday , word for word , gesture for gesture .

Sure . Yeah . " <p> I suppose when he got into this field , he was like Sisyphus pushing the rock up the mountain . Then one day , incredibly , the rock stayed up at the summit . Just a few loose pebbles came cascading down . I 'm one of the loose pebbles . At the AIDS Resource Center they are having a workshop on reentering the workforce ; Thursday evenings , from seven to ten , a group called Lazarus meets . I will not be reentering the workforce ; I will not be joining the Thursday evening group . <p> " Mr. Uh  --  " <p> " Barrows . " <p> " Any relation to the senator ?

He does not put his hand on my shoulder and attempt to make eye contact . I am grateful for this . Forty-seven , he says , telling me the result of some test from the printout in his hand . Twenty-two . My white blood cell count is holding steady . The Dow Jones is up . My CD4 cells are down . <p> " Your cholesterol 's one-fifty . That 's great , " he says , and we both laugh . <p> " I could go eat some lard , " I say . <p> " Haagen-Dazs , " he says . <p> " Well , I guess I do n't have to worry about my heart .

" <p> " Yes , " I say . <p> " Now about your eyes ... " he says . <p> My ancestors pepper the passenger list of the Mayflower ; a great-great-grandfather gave Henry Adams a black eye , an event unrecorded in his Education . I am not from the most distinguished branch of the family , I must admit . I am a younger son , descended of younger sons . My father found the notion of knotting a piece of silk around his neck anti going out to earn a living a puzzling one . Instead he went to the Gardner , read the Times , and watched his investments . <p> Between my junior and my senior year at Choate , while the kids from nouveau riche families headed to Europe , those of us from solid old families worked at canneries on the Cape or waited tables in Newport . Perhaps Chairman Mao got the idea of sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I worked at a bar in Provincetown . That summer on the Cape , I learned that other people had middle names like Ann or Thomas , not fine old family names , names that could n't go to waste . I gathered in the kitchen with my coworkers to make fun of the fags . ( I modestly admit I did the best imitations . ) A few years later , in a history class at Harvard taught by a junior professor ( he was not given tenure ) , I learned that via such mockery was justified class antagonism thwarted . About the same time , in an expensive psychiatrist 's office , I was learning why my imitations had been so apt . <p> During a junior year at Oxford , I got the hang of the British way of doing things . Private proclivities could be just that : one could couple dutifully , beget sons ( and daughters ) ; heterosexual activity could be like a twice-a-year trip to the dentist . <p> And what of Patricia , my poor wife ? She was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was her chance for making a decent match . She got my name , sons out of her loins . Although I was n't what one in a court of law would call faithful , still I kept my compact . Our marriage was loveless , granted , but unlike many of the romantic pairings around us , after a few years we had not gone fetid and bitter . <p> She divorced me shortly after my diagnosis : public humiliation was not part of the bargain . <p> Sons ? Two . ( Like most children , mine probably counted the issue of their generation and thought , they did it twice . They were wrong , of course , but not by much . ) <p> Ah , my sons , my sons ! <p> Pardon me , I grow bathetic . It is an unpleasant side effect of my condition . <p> Dexter , my elder ( and , I must admit , my more favored ) child , seems to be weathering this well . There is a gap of nearly a decade between him and Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etcetera . ) Dexter is on the partnership track at Burton , Myers g : Dudley . <p> But my poor , loony Charlie ! He was sixteen when I had my first opportunistic infection . Charlie found it embarrassing to ( a ) have a father ; ( b ) have a father who was dying ; ( c ) have a father who was dying of AIDS . <p> Charlie is twenty now . He has a band . His band is called Anti-Man . <p> " Are you lesbians ? " I asked . <p> No : it 's an ecology thing . They are in favor of one species becoming extinct : Homo sapiens . Charlie is a fount of information : how many pounds of laundry detergent are used per capita in the United States each year . ( Pardon me , I have forgotten the exact figure . The dementia , you know . ) Charlie does not wear deodorant ; he launders his clothes but rarely ; he bathes every other week . Not only is he sparing the environment by this ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such enormous effort to escaping its animal origins , and this act  --  or rather , I should say , omission  --  reminds us we are merely gussied-up primates . <p> A neurologist enters my room and asks me to repeat a string of numbers . He asks me to track his moving finger with my eyes . He says " OK " and leaves . <p> At the moment , Charlie is in England . He checks in weekly , via telephone ( I pick up the tab ) . On his most recent call , he told me he had been at Stonehenge , where he dropped acid and watched the sun rise , in honor of the summer solstice . He informs me that this was " cosmic , " and " heavy , but , you know , not in a bad way . " Charlie and I seem to have what psychologists call good communication . My own father was a remote figure . At Charlie 's age , had I had any experiences that were either " cosmic " or " heavy "  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share these with my father . <p> They are in and out of my room all day : an infectious-disease resident , an ophthalmologist , a physical therapist , an occupational therapist , a social worker  --  she by the name of Ms. Brenda A. O'Malley , the only one among the lot who dresses in clothes like those people in the outside world wear . The rest wear pale-green scrubs that make them look like children on a Sunday morning , playing hospital in their rumpled pajamas while their parents sleep in . <p> Ms. O'Malley sets her black satchel on the floor , and I see that it contains a book called Appreciating Opera . Dear Ms. O'Malley wants to improve herself . Forgive me my many petty cruelties , but understand : I must now seize all the opportunities . I will not get to be a garrulous old man . ( I wonder if the A. on her nametag stands for Ann . ) <p> Ms. O'Malley is accompanied by someone called the Discharge Planner . <p> " I do n't know much , " Ms. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " <p> " I 've always been comfortable , " I say . I allow the word to roll around in my mouth . Does comfortable mean capable of being comforted ? <p> Ms. O'Malley and the Discharge Planner speak with me about spending down . They say that even quite considerable assets can be eaten up . <p> Munch , munch , munch , I 'm a goat out to lunch . It 's a line from a book I read the boys when they were little . It cascades through my head all afternoon . Munch , munch , munch , I 'm a goat out to lunch . <p> Later , my son Dexter pops in . <p> " I ca n't stay long , " he says , his eyes darting about . <p> Dexter leans his right ankle against his left knee . " Dad , " he says , <p> " I want to ask your input on something . Christi What a word ! Advice , Dad , I want your advice . " Dexter drums his fingers against the aquamarine vinyl arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a lag time of a few seconds while I figure out that this is my brother , the good senator  --  has suggested that Dexter make a run for attorney general . If my son is elected , the correct form of address for him will be " the Honorable Dexter Barrows . " My Dexter ! <p> " Well , Dad , the other thing is  --  well , money . " <p> Ah , yes . <p> My lawyer is another numbers man . This many hundreds of thousands here ; this many hundreds of thousands there . Sheltered , he says . When he says " trust " he is talking about something that can be established with a wave of a pen . Guardians . Majority . Structure . Assets . Closely held corporations . Durable power of attorney . He also talks about something referred to as " in the event of your , uh  --  " <p> I call my progeny together : faithful son and prodigal , who has cut short his English adventure to return to my bedside . Dexter arrives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape . I can no longer read . Read print , as Ms. O'Malley would say . <p> I had several mistaken impressions about this process of going blind . I thought it was going to be Keatsian . I thought the light would fade , grow dimmer and dimmer and then flicker wanly out . But no , it 's quite Byronic . Dexter comes in and finds me sitting in the dark , switches on the light . <p> " Christ , no . Jesus God . " I put my hands over my eyes . " The light ! " <p> " What ? " he says . " What ? " <p> " Turn off the fucking light ! " I shout . <p> " Christ , Dad , " he says . The swearing in each other 's presence is new . Then : " Sorry , " more annoyed than repentant .

" <p> " The infection is n't responding to treatment , " I say . <p> " What does that mean ? " Dexter asks . <p> " It means I am going blind . " <p> " Oh , God , " Dexter says . He folds himself double , pounds his fists on the edges of the orange plastic chair in which he is seated . " Oh , Jesus . Oh , fuck , " he says . <p> " Dexter , " I say . " Dexter . I 'm sorry  --  " <p> " Dad , " he interrupts me . " This guy that 's treating you , are you sure he 's good ? " <p> " Yes , " I say . " He 's very highly thought of . " <p> " Yeah , OK , " Dexter says . " But will you just get a second opinion ? " <p> Poor Dexter . He can not believe that all my wit , all my urbanity , my cultivation , my money , my taste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me now . <p> The other issue of my loins enters the room , shaggy , redolent , muttish , ruttish . <p> " Do n't turn on the light , " Dexter warns . " Dad 's eyes ... " <p> " Hey , bro , " Charlie says , hitting Dexter 's arm . <p> " Hey , man , " Dexter says . " How was Europe ? " <p> Charlie leans over and kisses me . He bicycled to the hospital from his shared house in Somerville , and a droplet of sweat drips off his face and onto mine . <p> " What 's up with your eyes ? " <p> " By my lusts were my eyes put out .... " <p> " He has an infection . It 's not responding to treatment . He 's going to get a second opinion . " <p> " Dad , " Charlie chides , " it 's cool that you 're gay . " <p> I never thought of myself as gay . Rather , as having a bad habit particularly resistant to being broken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt ( that endless gray Puritan ocean ) ; a behaviorist prescribed a rubber band around my wrist that I would snap when any " troublesome thoughts " surfaced . <p> " Well , " I say , " my sons . " I push a button , and my bed rises up into a throne . " My kingdom shall be divided . " <p> I give them a brief overview of the trusts and the guardians , the process of spending down . Medi-Medi , I explain , as Ms. O'Malley explained it to me . Given my foresight in applying for SSDI , I have been Officially Disabled for more than the requisite seventeen months , so Medicare has kicked in ; and once I am asset-free , Medicaid will also .... The details  --  for instance , that Charlie 's birthright has been put into a trust , with Dexter as trustee  --  I glide swiftly over . ( I fear otherwise Charlie 's portion might end up tossed to street children in Saigon  --  excuse me , Ho Chi Minh City  --  or donated to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer will go over the details with them , tomorrow in his office , at ten . The papers have been drawn up . The instruments will be signed and duly witnessed . <p> Dexter shakes my hand  --  shakes my hand !  --  and leaves . <p> I walk my elbows back along the white sheets , lower my torso . " You talk , Charlie . " <p> Like Hamlet , he has undergone a sea change . No , he has not decided to follow his brother into public service . But the whole trip was  --  well , a trip . He has gotten in touch with his heritage  --  not , you understand , Governor Bradford and his dour **29;982;TOOLONG grandfathers . His mother came from Main Line Philadelphia Quaker stock , and he has , with great enthusiasm , been reading about the early doings of Quaker founder George Fox . " Those guys were really radical , Dad , " he says , growing so excited that he sprays me with a soft offering of his saliva . " Oops , sorry . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march through the streets naked . Through the streets of London . It was shocking because you could n't tell people 's rank  --  I mean nobody looked rich or poor when they were naked ; they just looked , you know , like naked people . I mean , I 'm descended from them . " <p> He is going back beyond this , to the days when our forebears worshiped stocks and stones . He has discovered the pagan gods of Albion ; the band is going to rename itself Magog , after one of them . They will sing of a happier time , when we all lived in huts of twigs and mud , with our goats and pigs and sheep wandering happily in and out of the manse . <p> Then he is silent . After a while he says : " Mom says , uh , she says hi . " <p> " Tell her hi from me . " <p> He sits there , studying the elongated tips of his fingers for so long that I wonder if he has n't perhaps imbibed some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dad . Do you worry about the end ? I mean , about really suffering ? " <p> I find it slightly amusing that my son thinks this does n't qualify as real suffering . I must wear it well . <p> " Because , Dad  --  I would do anything for you . If you ever  --  wanted-anything  --  " and I understand he is volunteering to help me kill myself . " You know , Dad . You know . " <p> I strove to break my son of the habit of saying " You know . " I am glad I did not succeed . I reach out and rub his shoulders . " Charlie , " I say . " Charlie . " <p> The Discharge Planner has done her work . Like pus oozing from an orifice , like noxious effluent into the harbor , I have been discharged-into a supported-living situation , a motel-like building that , though only a few years old , has already begun to go to seed . I am taking classes at an organization called Beacon for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even before I joined this elect company , I found the name a strange one-whatever did blind people want with a beacon ? <p> The Beacon for the Blind van drops me off at my apartment . In dim light , the world has become a work of abstract expressionism . ( Bright light has become a work of pain . ) I sit on the couch covered with such cheap material that even through my trousers it makes my flesh prickle . I lean over and turn on the radio . " What sort of an effect do you think this will have on Senator Barrows 's career ? " I must admit that my heart leaps  --  my brother in trouble ! My handsome , heterosexual brother ! My brother the senator , with his house five times the size of the one that was once mine ! And then I remember Dexter 's alliance . Or perhaps it is now a misalliance . <p> " Well , " the commentator sounds vaguely amused . " I do n't think the problems that our state 's other political dynasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this situation . I think it 's a lot more likely that their reaction will be ' Enough is enough . ' It 's also safe to say that either of these problems coming alone might have been seen differently  --  but the fact that Senator Barrows seems to have left his son to struggle alone with quite a severe drug problem while he himself was off pursuing this-relationship ... " <p> It turns out that my seventeen-year-old nephew , Joshua , was found in a hallway in Roxbury " suffering from an apparent drug overdose , " in the words of the Boston Police . ( I am no monster : the minute I hear this I feel guilty for my momentary thrill of joy . ) His mother was unreachable , on a photo safari in Kenya ; when Joshua came to , he gave the nurses , who had been unable to reach his father , a number where he could be contacted . His father was chauffeured to the hospital by a woman the tabloids will describe as " a voluptuous blonde . " An enterprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , interviewed her friends and neighbors : the scandal broke . <p> Four hundred years ago our ancestors would have been put in stocks or in the dunking chair . My sister-in-law is shown disembarking from a plane , looking grim and weary . Joshua enters a fancy drug-treatment program , the senator 's office issues a statement filled with " profound regret " and a plea to be allowed " to work with his wife and son to do all we can to heal the difficult situation in which we now find ourselves . " <p> The press carries reports that Joshua prostituted himself to support his drug habit . Dexter has himself photographed at a childcare center . Dexter has himself photographed coaching a youth hockey team in Dorchester . I learn that while Dexter does not believe we can use volunteerism as a substitute for social programs that are both needed and cost-effective , he believes our society has become increasingly fragmented : we have an obligation to work together for the common good . I am surprised Dexter is not shown in some similar pose with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " spun . " <p> But no , Dexter patiently explains when he comes to visit me a week after my discharge : his campaign is aimed at the " demographics " that he has n't got . He reports on the results of various focus groups , which assure him that " the gays , " as he puts it , will vote for him without his extending any particular nods in their direction , while the white working-class vote  --  <p> " Well , Dad , I did n't really come over here to talk to you about demographics and focus groups . " Dexter is telling me that he is going to marry . He tells me his fiancee 's name . I do not recognize it . I was not aware that he even had a steady girlfriend . <p> " Sure , sure , " he is saying . Do n't I remember  --  she came to the summer house a couple of years ago ? <p> I remember a girl , broad-shouldered , big-boned , athletic , a trifle too hearty , given to guffawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the sort who will still look girlish at fifty . I remember that she and Dexter occupied separate bedrooms , at a time when it was tacitly agreed that no concessions to propriety were needed . <p> " Has she been your girlfriend all this time ? " <p> " No . We 've been friends for a long time . I think it 's not bad groundwork . " <p> He would like , he is telling me , to move into the flat I have left empty in Louisburg Square . Of course , I tell him . Dexter will bed his bride in the same room in which I , on rare occasion , bedded his mother . He will walk in scuffed brown leather slippers down the uneven , charming front steps to retrieve the morning papers that land in the bushes , as once I walked in scuffed brown leather slippers . <p> " Is this on account of Rob 's shenanigans ? " <p> " It moved the timetable along a little bit . " <p> This is how we know the truth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a few degrees to the left . So my son will enter a marriage  --  loveless sounds too harsh , though there will be no love there  --  a marriage of affection , a convenient arrangement . He will follow in his father 's footsteps . <p> Charlie arrives at my door with an offering of fresh-baked whole wheat bread . " I made you one myself , but it came out kind of like a brick . So I bought you this at the Zen bakery . " <p> " Thank you , Charlie , " I say . When I was sighted , I would have called this action I now make " fumbling " ; now I understand that I am searching the air for the proffered loaf . <p> Dexter thinks a brilliant doctor could cure me ; Charlie thinks whole wheat bread and Chinese herbs could cure me . Despair is a meal you eat alone . <p> But I share the Zen loaf with Charlie , nibbling on my portion : I 'm afraid of what it will do to my fragile digestive system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depress you . " <p> " It 's  --  " I want to say something clever , but I have nothing clever to say . " Yes , " I say . " Yes . " <p> " Do n't you want some art to hang on the walls ? I could ask Mom-that Jasper Johns print , you really loved that . " <p> How Patricia and I had rowed over that when we split apart ! Our twenty-five-year marriage may have been a sham in some ways , but , as that junior professor at Harvard taught me , bourgeois marriage was primarily an economic arrangement . How we fought over the spoils . Recently diagnosed , knowing I would soon , too soon , leave this world of things forever , how I clung to every molecule I possessed . And our convenient marriage , our rational marriage , our placid marriage , turned into an orgy of smashed crystal and slammed doors . I screamed words I could n't have imagined coming out of my mouth : " You ugly bitch ! You ugly , dog-faced bitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was free to scream , " You faggot ! You fucking little cocksucker ! " And then I was free to come back with something even crueler ; and then she was free , etcetera . Was it exhaustion that finally made us abandon the battle ? Or fear of how much further we might go ? <p> " I could n't see it well enough , Charlie . " <p> " Really , Dad ? " <p> " Really . " If I put my face a few inches from it , perhaps I could see an inch or two of color , which would no doubt awake in me the memory of the whole .... I do n't want to tell Charlie how flimsy , from where I am now standing , all the things of this life are . Those things , those things ! The cars and country houses and charming hand-painted , three-footed teapots bought at the Paris flea market , the first edition of To the Lighthouse , the old Billie Holiday 78s , the antique weathervane , the quilt my great-great-grandmother sewed .... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I say . <p> A month has passed .

" <p> " Death . " <p> I meant to say it with a certain ironic flip , but I did n't quite pull it off . Suddenly , there death is  --  not a man in a black hood from a Bergman movie , not a Day of the Dead figurine brought back from Mexico  --  but my death , my very own death , my one and only death  --  hunched naked in the air between us . <p> " Yes , " she says , and nods . <p> I hate her .

I hate her for loving me , because I do think for a few seconds after I said the word death , she did love me , as momentarily and intensely as I hated her . <p> And then : she looks down , smoothes her skirt .

Only Charlie and I are left . <p> " I 've been trying to call Dexter , " I confess . " I 've been calling him , but he has n't  --  " <p> " I really wanted to buy that statue for you , Dad . " <p> " No , Charlie , but  --  " <p> " I really wanted to . " " It 's just that I 'm so tired , " I say . <p> " Are you too tired to go home ? Do you want to stay here ? " <p> I had meant I was tired in a more general way , but suddenly I want nothing more than to sleep , to sleep now , to sleep here . <p> " Just for tonight . " <p> " You can sleep in my bed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just tonight . I 'm tired . I 'm just tired . " <p> " Do you want to go to bed now ? " he asks . <p> But when he leads me to his room , and I sit down on his bed , the sheets are gritty to my touch . " Would you mind , " I say , " terribly ? Changing the sheets ... " <p> " Sure , Dad , " he says . I stand up gingerly , and he yanks at the sheet , reeling it toward him like a fisherman his net . <p> He disappears down the hallway , returns . <p> " Hey , Dad , you got any quarters ? " <p> " Charlie ? " <p> " For the laundromat . " <p> " Oh , do n't  --  " I say . " Do n't you have a spare sheet ? " <p> " It 's cool , " he says . " The laundromat 's not far . " <p> I reach into my pocket , feel for quarters . Quarters are easy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in a public laundromat since that summer on the Cape . <p> " Yeah , Dad . It 's great . You going to be OK ? It 'll take me about an hour and a half . " <p> " I 'm fine , " I say . <p> " I could bring the boombox in here . I have some opera CDs . Well , one , I think  --  " <p> " No , " I say , " I 'll just rest . " <p> " You sure , Dad ? " <p> " I 'm sure . " <p> I curl up like a fetus on the bare blue-and-white mattress ticking , my head on the naked white pillow , which for some reason has the word Pillow repeated again and again on it in letters several inches high . <p> I do not drift off to sleep . Drifting is something that happened in that other world . Here fatigue wars with pain , which wars with a restless feeling in my legs . <p> At some point Charlie returns , shakes me awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he unbuttons my shirt , kneels at my feet and utilaces my shoes , pulls my feet free , tugs off my socks . He leaves my trousers on and takes me back to bed . <p> When I wake in the morning , a breathing blue blur is lying on the uncarpeted floor next to me . I can just make out unkempt hair rising like a halo around a head . I smell his smell . <p> " Charlie , " I whisper . " Charlie . Are you there ? Charlie ? " <p> He grunts . " Dad , " he mumbles . " Dad . " <p> <p> By Anne Finger <p>
