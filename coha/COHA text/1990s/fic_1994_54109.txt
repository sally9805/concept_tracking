ContentsPART TWO PART THREE # PART ONE <p> IN THE AUTUMN OF MY senior year of high school my Shadow spoke to me . The summer before that , John F. Kennedy was nominated/or president and my mother died behind the wheel of her car . <p> Until then my Shadow had been vague , hard to pinpoint , a secret friend who slipped in sometimes to get me into trouble . My mother 's Shadow , on the other hand , was clear and mean and often appeared when she drank . It was n't just two sides of the same person . As a little kid , at least a few times , I saw Mother and Shadow together . <p> Her death hardly gave me pause . Since she had been drinking , I managed to tell myself it was the Shadow who had died . As always , my mother would show up sweetly apologizing for being late for the funeral . <p> Aged sixteen , I told no one any of this . The Code of Silence for the Boston Irish was simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lots of things you did n't even tell yourself . <p> When he came to the wake , my stepfather had little to say . His divorce from my mother when I was ten was devastating . Not that Frank was all that great . Usually he ignored me . What I appreciated about him was that , like most people , he had no Shadow . While he was around we looked like a TV family . <p> All around me , aunts and cousins broke down . Gramny , my grandmother , aged visibly at the death of her youngest . Grand-Aunt Tay was badly shaken . I alone was dry-eyed . <p> On one occasion or another at the wake , each of my uncles , Bob the lawyer , Mike the cop , Jim who had the bar in Field 's Comer , got lit and talked to me about Ellen , their little sister . She had been their father 's favorite . I was the first and favorite grandchild . Terrible Tom Malloy , my grandfather , had founded the bar and the family fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fear of him . <p> Jim , the eldest , shook his head sadly . " They had hopes for you , Kevin . School and all . When you have time to recover , you have to think about your future . " <p> My plans included college but otherwise were vague . I thought sometimes about a .38 that rested in the upstairs hall closet . <p> The day of the funeral Aunt Tay hugged me . I do n't think anyone else has ever been called that . Teresa was her given name , like the saint , and she was very proud of it . But when , as first grandchild , I called her Aunt Tay , it stuck . Even Gramny , her sister , began calling her Tay . <p> This thin , white-haired lady with great blue eyes looked at me and said : <p> <p> BY FELL NIGHT <p> When I was small and down or scared , we had recited this verse . Tay Fallon was a storyteller , a poet . I tried to slip by her , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> <p> BY FELL NIGHT <p> She repeated and stood in my way . With a bored sigh , I gave the response : WITH STICK AND BONE <p> " Dilleachdan , " she said in Gaelic , which I did n't understand . " It 's hard for those of us with the gift . " It would n't surprise me if she knew I was thinking about the revolver upstairs . Tay had been born with a caul and claimed a kind of second sight . <p> She insisted that I too had a gift , . though what it was she never said . All I knew for sure was that I lived under a teenage curse : I was too smart to be a tough kid and too screwy to be a smart kid . The high school drama society was where I hid out . <p> Maybe the ability to see and to believe two completely different things is the very base of second sight . My mother had always said she wanted her effects to be given away to charity . That fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faceless guest room . Still , I managed to believe in one comer of my mind that she was alive . <p> In an Irish household of my grandmother 's generation , the eldest male , whatever his age , was Himself . His wishes might not all be law , but his every failing would surely be ignored as long as possible . My grandfather had died before I could remember , so when my mother moved in with Gramny and Aunt Tay , I became Himself . <p> That fall , I strained against the ropes and found there were none . My all-boys public school downtown made everyone wear coat and tie . But away from there , I started dressing like a street punk and growing my hair like JFK 's . I carried cigarettes and even smoked a few . I Shuck sips of whiskey at home and found winos willing to buy me half pints . At the Y where I had learned to swim a couple of years before , no one noticed when I started showing up again . <p> My grandmother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorchester , was a minefield of memorabilia . But my favorite was the .38 hidden in the upstairs hall closet . Oiled and cleaned and wrapped in a piece of chamois , it was something I was n't supposed to know about . <p> At first all I did was take it to my room and spin the cylinder . A box of ammo was wrapped with the revolver , but at that time , I never loaded it . Once , I put the barrel to the side of my head and pulled the trigger . When I did , I felt that someone was with me . But when I looked , I was alone . That time , I was careless about putting the revolver back . <p> Tay noticed . Had I been a few years younger , she might have whipped up some dark and special tea to snap me out of it . Instead , feeling in need of help , she leaked word discreetly to her nephew Bob , the lawyer . Bob 's wife , Aunt Alice , had a friend who recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him twice a week . <p> Tuesdays after school and early on Saturdays , I went over to Kenmore Square and talked to Dr. Charles Petrie , a fat middle-aged guy with nubby sweaters . Tuesdays , in blazer and loafers , I told him about my school problems . <p> " The Drama Society , remember , sir , I told you they 're doing Shakespeare 's Henry the Fourth , Part One . I told Mr. Royce , the faculty advisor , I wanted to be Hotspur , a great part , this rebel who stutters when he gets excited . " Petrie nodded like he knew the play . " Yesterday , I found out I 'm Poins , who 's this minor accomplice . And he 's not even in the last part . " <p> A pause followed until it occurred to Petrie that I had stopped talking . " What , " another pause , " was your reaction to this ? " <p> " I got real pissed . " <p> " Yes ? " He wrote that down . " Go on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen other analysts . Tuesdays , there was a receptionist and the place was full of patients : unhappy fat ladies , tense guys clutching briefcases . The entire building was busy . <p> Saturdays , the building was quiet and the office empty when I 'd come in wearing black chinos and a warm-up jacket . Petrie and I never talked about my mother or the gun or what it was I did after leaving the office . <p> One Saturday I told him , " I 'm in this long hallway , a sort of gallery with this soft kind of light and these middle-aged guys standing there . One of them looks at me , and says , ' You 're twins . ' " <p> The phrase " middle-aged guys " seemed to interest the doctor . He nodded and wrote that down . " Do you remember any more of your dreams ? " he asked . <p> I almost never remembered dreams . The week before , a guy called Joe had actually said that . Looking where he did , I glimpsed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practiced in mirrors . Then the kid was gone and Joe shook his head , saying , " Just seeing double . " <p> While I wondered how to explain that , Petrie said , " Time 's up , Kevin . See you Tuesday at three . " <p> Emerging from his office I found the waiting room no longer empty . A patient with long strawberry blonde hair sat on a couch leafing through a New Yorker . <p> She wore slacks and ankle-high riding boots . One of them rested on the low table in front of her in a way that was absolutely cool . With the dead accuracy of a kid , I realized she was a crucial few years my senior . I also knew that skin and bones like hers were expensive . <p> When she looked up , it was right into my wide eyes . From my limited experience of lovely girls , I was prepared for her to realize our differences in age and sophistication , frown and go back to her magazine . Instead , she nodded like she understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got from Petrie . Smiling , she asked , " Is your shrink giving you anything good ? " <p> Not sure what she meant , I shook my head . She nodded toward one of the offices . " I 'm seeing Kleinman , a dullard but occasionally useful . My name is Stacey Hale . " Stacey held out her hand . <p> " Kevin Grierson , " I said and took it . She left something in my palm . " Next time , have him give you those . " I looked down at a green , heart-shaped pill . " Dexedrine , " she said . " You 're here on Saturdays ? " Dr. Kleinman 's door opened as I nodded . <p> Out in the hall , I still saw her face . The pill was a little bitter when I washed it down at a water fountain . At first , I felt nothing . But by the time I reached the Y , I was sailing . Far away kids shouted in the pool ; in the gray lighted Gallery middle-aged men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ten dollars to pose , " and led me into an alcove . " Open your clothes . Let them slip down . Yes ! Jacket and shirt off your shoulders , hands behind you like you 're cuffed . Look tough . " I gave my practiced hard smile . " Freeze ! " He was creepy but he did n't touch me . Besides , all this felt like it was happening to someone else . <p> That afternoon , I bought a milk shake at a luncheonette and could n't finish it . Inside my head , something crackled like the blue sparks on streetcar wires . Gray and dowdy streets slid by around me until I found myself standing at a fence watching an engine shuttle cars in the Boston and Maine yards . In the distance , slanting October sun hit the John Hancock tower and I thought about Stacey . <p> Tuesday in blazer and slacks , I looked at Dr. Petrie and said , " You know , sir , there 's this kid in school who was having trouble like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it seemed to help . " <p> The drug never again worked like that first time . But by Friday when we read through Henry the Fourth , I already knew all my lines and most of everyone else 's . <p> Saturday morning , tingling from speed and anticipation , I came out of Petrie 's office and found the waiting room empty . Stacey 's doctor did n't even seem to be there . I was stunned . Outside at the curb sat a red MG with its motor running . Only when the horn blew did I focus . " Hey ! " I said . <p> Stacey smiled . " Can I ask a big favor ? " Anything ! She must have seen that . " This is a no-parking area . Could you find a place for it ? Oh , do you drive ? " <p> I shook my head , ashamed to let her down . She turned off the motor . " Then can I ask you an even bigger favor ? " Any plan imaginable could be canceled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the motor and pretend you 're going to pull out . " She tossed me the keys and went into the building , saying , " I 'll buy you lunch . It will be a chance to talk . " <p> Conscious of the immense trust , I sat vigilant in that front seat . Once or twice , I turned on the ignition and ran the motor , looking front and rear for the police car that never showed . <p> Later that day , in some town like Needham , we stopped at a drive-in and sat in the car nibbling hamburgers . Neither of us had much appetite . We giggled about that , then each took out a green pill and washed it down with the last of our Cokes . " How did you end up seeing Dr. Petrie ? " <p> Wanting to make an impression , I told her , " Playing with guns . That made them think I 'm suicidal . " <p> She looked at me , nodded and said , " Yes , they would . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves were changing . We parked on a road overlooking a gold and red valley and she told me , " I have to see a shrink to fulfill a probation requirement . There was a little party at school , kind of an orgy actually , and I ran amok . You know how it is . " Only able to dimly imagine , I nodded . <p> " Kleinman at least understands it 's all a game . He gives me prescriptions , collects his fees and does n't interfere . " She laughed . " The only trouble I have with speed is that once in a while , out of the corner of my eyes , I see this snake dart . " <p> Emboldened , I told her , " Sometimes , just for a second , I see this Shadow beside me . He has my face . " <p> She stopped laughing . " There 's someone you might want to talk to . He 's called Dr. X. I 'll mention you to him . " She started the car . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In Dorchester , neighborhoods went by the names of Catholic parishes . Mine was Mary , Queen of Heaven . " Queena Heaven . You can drop me at any MTA station . " <p> " And miss seeing a place called Queena Heaven ? Just give me directions . " It was dusk as we arrived . Stacey glanced at Snyder 's Market and the Stop and Shop , the bars , the Shamut Bank and the elevated station . We drove up the steep hill past the brick gothic church . <p> The street I lived on ended with a cement wall . Beyond that , row after row of wooden three deckers marched down to the Boston harbor and ten thousand diapers flew like banners from their back porches . <p> Seeing my grandmother 's house with Stacey was like seeing it for the first time ; I noticed how gray and spooky it looked in the dying light . " Hey , " I said , " it 's haunted but what the hell . " <p> She leaned over and ruffled my hair . Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her interest in me was a mystery I did n't want to unravel . <p> Next Saturday , I watched her car again . Afterward , Stacey found a deserted stretch of road and gave me my first driving lesson . Several times our hands touched and a jolt went through me . When she dropped me off at home , I said , " Dr. Petrie is n't doing me much good . What about this guy Dr. X ? , " <p> Stacey kissed me on the mouth and said , " We 'll see . " She must have known that she owned my soul . <p> Inside , my grandmother , a flurry of flour and white hair , was busy in the kitchen . " Jimmy , my love , " she said , mistaking me for her son the bar owner , " run down to Snyder 's for some baking powder before he closes . " <p> The following Saturday , very tense , Stacey asked , " Do you have any pills ? " Feeling I 'd failed her , I shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . When Stacey came out she had been crying . <p> She sat for a moment before saying , " I 've got a scrip . But I 'm broke . " Desperately , I searched my pockets and came up with sixty cents . " This is bad , Kevin . I need something or I am going to flip out . " My heart leaped at this opportunity . I had her drive me to the Y. <p> Saturdays , they gave kids swimming lessons . We swam bare ass and got yelled at by counselors in trunks . But some of us found out that instead we could walk past the locker room into this long gallery where kids got treated with great respect . <p> There , frosted windows set in deep alcoves let in a pearly light and older guys always stood around the door . When I came in , one of them whispered , " Fred . " Everyone always whispered like it was church . Fred was the name I used . This was the guy who said he was Joe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe and generous . He made a little gesture indicating both of us and we stepped into one of the alcoves . Deftly he positioned me on a window ledge and showed me his bald spot . My eyes went out of focus . Far away , someone whistled the theme from The High and the Mighty . Joe stuck the money in my pants and murmured , " You 're a good kid , Fred . Where do you live ? " <p> " In a projects , " I told him and waved good-bye . <p> When I proudly handed her the money , Stacey regarded me curiously . Innocent in a strange kind of way , I could n't imagine why . A few minutes later she came out of a drug store already looking much better and said , " You are definitely ready for Dr. X. You can learn a lot . But watch out for him . And remember you come there as my friend . " <p> That struck me as odd . " Is he a psychiatrist ? " <p> " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She took Beacon Street out of town . <p> I remember asking , " His name is Dr. X ? " as she turned off Beacon and down a curving suburban road . Ponds lay behind stands of trees . Victorian mansions spread over the tops of hillocks . <p> " He needs to protect his identity . There are a lot of things society just does n't understand . " <p> Without slowing , she drove through a set of open iron gates , went up a curving driveway and parked under a portico . " He has a nice house , " I said . <p> " Actually , this is my mother 's place . He practices here while she 's away . " Before getting out of the car , Stacey slipped some of the pills from the bottle into her pocket . <p> She called , " Hello ? " when she opened the front door . The place was quiet , dark with the curtains mostly drawn . On the hall table was a used Kleenex and a coffee cup filled with half-drowned cigarettes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried into the rag . <p> To our left was a book-lined room that I identified as the library . A figure in a black suit stirred on a couch , a small man with a round face and a fringe of gray hair . " A new communicant ? " he asked in the voice of a testy troll . For a bad moment I thought that this was Dr. X. <p> " Hello , Max , " said Stacey . " Max was once an Episcopal priest , " she explained as she led me through a big kitchen . It stank of garbage and dirty dishes . On the table lay an open dictionary with pages hollowed out to create a pocket . On a sideboard a silver bowl had been polished till it shone in the gloom . Upstairs , someone put on a record , jazz piano . <p> Lonely notes echoed through the halls . Stacey opened a door and motioned me down a flight of stairs . At the bottom was a low , windowless room . Walls , ceiling , floor were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceiling . The only furnishings were a white table and two chairs . <p> At the table facing the door was a guy , older , maybe thirty . A black beard made it hard to tell . " Dr. X , " said Stacey , " this is Kevin . " He was big and looked like he had once been fat . He wore a blue Oxford knit shirt outside his pants . <p> " Hi , Kevin . " Dr. X rose to shake my hand . " Stacey 's talked about you . " <p> " And look what he bought us . " She held up the vial . <p> " Oh boy , vitamins ! Thanks , Kevin ! " Grabbing with the impulsiveness of a kid , he washed down a couple of the pills with the contents of a huge pewter stein that he picked up from the floor beside him . " Stacey said you were acting . What play. ? " <p> Self-consciousness seized me . " Henry the Fourth . It 's pretty stupid . Just school . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the vial in his pocket . " It 's about the demimonde . " He waved his arm to indicate the house , the three of us . " About the street and rich people slumming . Wonderful lines ! Falstaff says , ' Let us be Diana 's foresters , gentlemen of the shade , minions of the moon . ' " <p> " I just have a small part . Poins , he 's a . . . . " <p> " Poins ! " Dr. X slapped his hands together . " Terrific ! Poins is the knife , the street trickster . Even Falstaff is wary of him . Poins is some kind of disinherited son . He and Prince Hal are very young . Boys are natural street people , powerless , disposable . Poins disappears from the play because that happens to people like him . " <p> Dr. X in his exuberance walked over to Stacey , put his hands on her breasts , and kissed her . He looked at my sudden jealousy and smiled . She excused herself and went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known what play I was in and read up . If so , that was more trouble than Petrie had ever taken . <p> I sat in one chair with Dr. X opposite me and we listened to distant music . " Thelonius in San Francisco , " he explained , taking out the vial and offering me a pill . He handed me his stein and I washed it down with warm beer . <p> Soon , my attention to detail became more intense . The only thing on the table was a blank prescription pad . I noticed the name Blumstein at the top . In a far comer of the floor was a bolt lock . It took me a moment to see the outline of a trap door . The music from upstairs changed at one point . Dr. X 's mouth moved like he was tasting the notes . " Could , playing Bach 's Goldberg Variations , " he said . <p> That first Saturday , we talked for hours . Some of the insights which bowled me over are true of any unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien in this land . In this world . " <p> Other things he saw were phenomenally accurate . " You have , let 's see , three uncles , " he said , staring into my eyes with his intense pinned ones . " The youngest one 's a pries . . . no , a lawyer . The middle one 's a cop , of course . And the oldest one does what ? Runs a bar . " <p> Never had I discussed my mother 's family with Stacey . He smiled at my surprise and said , " What makes this an Irish joke is that the bartender has all the money . " <p> At that moment someone knocked on the door upstairs . Dr. X rose , shook my hand , and said , " See you next Saturday ? " as if he looked forward to it . I nodded eagerly . <p> A fox-faced man with red hair , the next patient , brushed past me on the cellar steps . Stacey was not to be found on the first floor and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library couch . " Go in peace , " he said as I left . <p> Outside was a cold drizzle . That did n't bother me . My pulses skipped . Lights were on in other houses . But Stacey 's , when I looked back from the end of the driveway , was dark . Then I saw her at an upstairs window . My heart bounded with speed and passion . She saw me . Or rather she saw the one who for a moment stood beside me . Because he blew her a kiss and she returned it . <p> Too excited to let that worry me , with a Bostonian 's sixth sense , I headed for the nearest streetcar stop . <p> In the play , Falstaff says about Pores , " If men were saved by merit what hole in hell were hot enough for him . " Monday at rehearsal , remembering all Dr. X had told me , I bounced on my toes and talked like Fred who lived in a projects . <p> " Easy does it , Grierson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is Shakespeare , not the Untouchables . " <p> Over the next couple of weeks , I saw Dr. X regularly . Like amphetamine , he was never as good as that first time . When there were pills on the table he 'd give me an upper or a downer . If there were n't , he borrowed some of mine . <p> I came to understand that there were ways in which he was a fool . Sometimes he said stuff like , " I 'm a quarter Irish , a quarter French , a quarter English with a bit of German and smattering of Jew . Blood boils in me . " He called speed vitamins and claimed it enabled him to read other peoples ' minds . <p> Despite that , he had his moments . " Who is the third who always walks beside you ? " he once asked . " When I count there 's just you and me . But when I look there is always another walking beside you . " Later I realized he was paraphrasing T.S . Eliot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He followed it up . " Everybody 's got another self , Kevin . Most people , the dull , the mundane , never show it . But some get to let that dog run . " <p> Every Saturday , I drove with Stacey out to her house . I thought about her constantly . Everything else , school , family , Dr. Petrie , even the Gallery , was backdrop to those rides . Yet , each week she seemed a little more distant . We talked , but any mention by me of Dr. X and she became silent . <p> Max was always present and there were others : college guys in tweed jackets clustered around a lady who smoked a pipe , a man in a turtleneck who played guitar , girls wearing leotards , a very light-skinned negro man with a much older white woman . <p> One week when we came in , Max sat in the library with a plump pale girl close to my age . Stacey grimaced and muttered , " Slug , " under her breath . <p> Max introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of finishing herself . " He added , " We have an oubliette , you know , " as if he could n't imagine my not wondering about that . <p> Everyone , but especially Dr. X , needed more and more drags to function . When I went downstairs after meeting Lisa , he waved a prescription at me . " Kevin , there 's a druggist in Coolidge Corner . A careless guy . I want you to go over there and break this . No one would suspect your choir boy face . " <p> It struck me as a bad idea . I shook my head and Dr. X told me , " You refuse because your mundane persona still holds sway . There 's a little treatment I recommend . Isolation . Once you 're alone , the stronger part of your personality can take over . " <p> Suddenly understanding I looked toward the trap door and repeated the unfamiliar word , " Oubliette . " <p> Dr. X smiled like I was a prize pupil . " From the French oublier , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't be in there long . Maybe a couple of days over the Thanksgiving weekend . " At the time , nothing more was said . <p> The Saturday before Thanksgiving , Stacey and I found Max and everybody else downstairs in Dr. X 's office . " Just in time to witness a graduation ceremony , Kevin , " said the doctor , unlatching the door to the oubliette . <p> He opened it to reveal a wooden ladder leading down to pitch dark . From below a tiny voice cried , " It 's cold down here . I 've come to terms with myself . " <p> Dr. X descended . Max waited at the top of the ladder . He extended his hand to Lisa . Her eyes were empty . All she wore was one of Dr. X 's big Oxford weave shirts . " Lisa was bold enough to want to confront herself , " said Dr. X , glancing at me . Max and the others smirked . <p> When Stacey and I went back upstairs , she looked at me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks and said , " Kevin , this is no place for you . I thought you could handle Dr. X. But my judgment was off , maybe my timing . You 're almost ready , but you 're still a kid . He sees your potential too . Get out of here before he hurts you . " <p> She kissed me on the mouth and said , " When I need someone , I 'll call and you 'll be ready . " On my way home , I managed to forget the warning and the brush-off and remembered only the kiss . <p> The first thing I did when I got in the door was to turn off the fire under a pot in the kitchen . Tay still worked as secretary to professors over in Cambridge . That day she was helping one of them sort his papers . <p> My grandmother was present but not totally accounted for . She sat in the living room in the midst of boxes of photos and papers . With a bright smile she said , " Here 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken before the turn of the century , a baby stared wide-eyed in the midst of a vast christening gown . <p> " Nah , this is me , Gramny . " I was in a snapshot of my mother , my grandfather , and myself on the front steps of the house . My mother stood looking up proudly at Terrible Tom Malloy , saloon owner , ward heeler , legendary terror . He looked like a meaner , smarter version of his sons . <p> He stared right at the camera with clever , cold eyes . One arm he had around my mother . I was a blurry bundle in the other . I remembered when I was about ten my mother telling me about her father . " Your uncles are still afraid of Daddy . If the old man came back and told them to , they 'd all line up to get hit . " <p> We sped off from a family gathering like it was a getaway . She had suddenly pulled me away from my cousins and loaded me in the car as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I make them afraid of me too . " She laughed . " I just did it now . " The laugh scared me more than the driving . It meant that my mother was drunk and her Shadow was at the wheel . <p> The next picture I found was a familiar one of my parents ' wedding . It was wartime . In the background girls with flowers , guys in uniforms smiled at the couple walking arm in arm . In a spring dress and wide hat my mother , beautiful as some half-remembered forties movie star , leaned on my father 's shoulder and smiled at the camera . <p> My father in his navy blues stared bewildered and adoring only at her . He came from New Jersey , met and married my mother while waiting to go overseas . With hundreds of others , he died when the cruiser LaSalle went down in the South Pacific . He had almost no family . Once I had imagined 1 was secretly the son of a hero , the Lone Ranger , maybe , or Ted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to fantasize . <p> " Poor lamb , " said my grandmother , looking at my father . " He had n't a piece of meanness in him . " She put out her hand and I helped her upstairs for a rest . <p> Back on the couch , I found photos of my mother from childhood up to the time of her second marriage . For a long while there was nothing . As she got older she hated to have her picture taken . <p> Then at the bottom of the box was one I had never seen . A few years before , Aunt Alice had taken candid photos with her new flash camera . Alice was no artist , the pictures were unfocused , feet and heads were cut off , radiators were centers of attention . <p> But in one , she had caught my mother walking into a room with a glass in her hand . At first , the photo appeared to be a double exposure . Two mothers looked up . But instead of being identical , one wore a tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked angry at being caught . <p> That night after the TV stations left the air , I sat sleepless at the kitchen table staring at papers . Some documents had my name on them . Every time there was a creak or bump in the house , I half expected the front door to open and my mother to come in . Once I looked up to find Tay watching me . <p> " Ah , Kevin , you 're so wise and owl-eyed lately . And you have n't been eating . There 's ham and eggs in the ice box . " <p> " I 'm not hungry . " <p> " Cocoa then . You always liked me to make cocoa . " Tay moved to the sink to fill the kettle . She looked over my shoulder at a picture of my mother at her junior prom . " She was her father 's favorite . " I nodded , interested . <p> Then she said , " Remember the story I told when you were small . How once there was a king with three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited him very well indeed ? And as it happened . . . . " <p> Impatient at what I saw as bedtime stories , I said , " And she gets cheated and gets turned into a magic hawk or something . I remember but I 'm a little old for that . There 's stuff about me , Tay . . . I need to figure things out . " <p> She waited , but words could take me no further . After a long pause , she reached out and patted my hair . " Faileas , " she said . <p> It did n't occur to me that she recognized my trouble and was also struggling to put words to it . Sullen , I turned away from her . That Monday , I took the double photo of my mother and the papers with my name on them to school and stuck them in my locker , intending to study them later . <p> That year , family Thanksgiving was at Uncle Jim 's house in Milton . Crying , " God bless us , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins as soon as we came in the door . <p> Thanks to the speed , I ate almost no dinner . But I drank quite a bit . Afterwards , kids laughed and screamed , women washed the dishes and my uncles leaned on the furniture with their glasses . As the oldest nephew , I was allowed in their presence . <p> They were talking about Kennedy . " Sure , a great day for the Irish , " said Bob with a phony brogue . <p> " The black Irish , " said Mike . <p> " That 's niggers to you , " Jim said and they looked my way , noticed my distaste . <p> Uncle Bob poured me a beer . " From what I see , you 're not much interested in school . College has gotten really expensive . Maybe you should think of the navy . Three years , see the world . " <p> " My boards and SATs are fine . I 'll probably go to BU . " <p> Jim said , " Bob went to college and law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has finally got his head above water . Me , I got an eighth grade education and I 'm the one everyone comes to for dough . The thing is , now there is no dough . " We were sitting in his twelve room house . Neither of his brothers seemed to be hurting . <p> " Granddad put aside money . My mother . . . . " <p> " Your mother raised an aristocrat , " said Bob , sounding aggrieved . " Boot camp would be a change for you . " <p> " Kevin never listens to anyone . Maybe he 's in love , " said Mike , giving me the dead-eyed glance cops reserve for outsiders . " You got a girl friend , Kev ? " <p> How to explain about Stacey and myself ? I just shrugged . But I started thinking of her . Then Jim remarked , " Dad used to say when he took off his belt , ' Whip a young dog who 's too big for his pants and puppy drawers fit him fine . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no joking . <p> When I was small , they had sometimes intimidated me . Even at sixteen , I was skinny and my uncles were all big . But I remembered what my mother had said about them and their old man . Full of pills and booze , I just stared the way my grandfather did in the picture . For that moment , I was not alone . They choked like they had glimpsed my Shadow . <p> It was late when I saw Tay and my grandmother home . All my thoughts ran to Stacey and I slipped away . Connections were slow . It was alter one when I looked up at dim lights flickering in her second floor windows . I had to knock for some time before Max appeared . His pupils small as BBs , he waved me in like I was expected . <p> " Stacey ? " I wanted to know . He ignored the question . <p> Lisa sat in the kitchen with a trace of drool beside her mouth , sorting pills . " Once my inhibitions got broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm the woman of situations . Yesterday , for instance , the situation was that everyone needs to get sleep . So I cashed prescriptions for these . " She handed me a pill shaped like a torpedo . <p> Thelonius played upstairs . " Isolation and realization , " said Max and poured Johnny Walker . " Drink up . " I marveled at how little effect any of this had on me and my Shadow . <p> A time later , I found myself up on the second floor knocking on a locked door . After a while , the music and voices inside stopped . In the silence , I called " Stacey ! " The door swung wide and Dr. X stood in an open bathrobe . He was semi-hard . Behind him , a slab of moonlight , maybe streetlight , fell on a slim figure on a wide bed . " Stacey ? " I stepped into the room . <p> " Do n't let him see me , " she said . Immediately , Dr. X turned on a lamp . Stacey was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with the bathrobe cord . Instead of getting mad at Dr. X , she said to me , " What the hell are you doing here ? Did I invite you ? " <p> Dr. X laughed . " Look at how angry this makes him . Wait downstairs , Kevin . There 's something we have to do . " I knew what he intended . But I obeyed . <p> My heart should have been crushed . I should have been staggering and falling down . Instead , remote and cold and wide awake , I moved with great purpose . Down in the kitchen , Max gave me another pill . I yawned and pretended to lose my balance when he led me to the white room . I slid down the wall and lay on the floor with my coat as a pillow . <p> Max watched me and then went back upstairs . I slept open-eyed the way sharks do . Everything was red and grainy and I could see myself lying on the floor . " You 're in the Eye of Storm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a while before Dr. X appeared . He held me up while Max emptied my pockets . I watched them guide me toward the open trap door with my head lolling , empty pockets hanging out like dogs ' ears . <p> As Dr. X opened the trap door , I made it as easy as possible for Max to hold me upright . When they brought Lisa out of the oubliette , Dr. X had gone down to help her . As I watched from above , he descended again . <p> That 's when my Shadow and I made our move . Max , stunned , looked from the zombie he held upright to the figure who grabbed him . Dr. X , wide-eyed , breathed , " Doppelganger ! " <p> Then I swung Max over the trap door . I planted a shoe on his skinny ass and shoved him down on top of Dr. X. I slammed the trap door and locked it shut . On the table were my keys , wallet , and cigarettes . There was also a prescription pad . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. X said calmly , " I thought you were more mature than this , Kevin . Just undo the latch and we can talk . " Upstairs on the kitchen table were many pills which I scooped up . Only then did the booze and drugs start to hit me . My stomach lurched , blood banged in my head . <p> Upstairs , Stacey cried out like she was still tied up . I waited but she did n't say my name . I needed fresh air . " Do n't forget to call me ! " I yelled and headed for the front door . She started to wail . <p> In the library , the situation was that Lisa snored with her mouth open .. " Do n't do the thing that will get you killed , little boy , " Dr. X yelled while pounding the trap door . " I see death around you . Cold nights and bad days , Kevin ! " <p> In the first light , water trickled in gutters . The air smelled of wet dead leaves . A voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamins . " I did n't turn to look . The face of your Shadow is always closer to your fears than your hopes . <p> PART TWO Back home , I got to my more without encountering Tay or Gramny . A red torpedo from the cache put me out . Late in the day , I looked at the foot of the bed and saw a guy with a banged up face and hair that looked like the army had gotten him . <p> It took me a moment to recognize my Shadow . He smiled like that hurt him and spun the cylinder of the revolver . " This is one sport you 'd be good at , " he said as he aimed at his temple . " Mom liked to play roulette too . Only , she did it with a car . " <p> He pulled the trigger . I jumped as the hammer clicked on an empty chamber . " People kill themselves when they do n't have the nerve to kill someone else . Like Mom with her brothers . She could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know they screwed her out of money . Instead of getting mad at them , she killed herself . <p> " Do n't make that same mistake . You do n't have to kill . All you have to do is show Uncle Jim that you are n't afraid . Take the gun and visit him today . I 'll be there . We 'll talk about our future . And his . Do it or you 'll end up looking like this . " <p> There was more but all of it scared me and I woke up dry-mouthed , soaked in sweat . More drugs kept me awake and distracted . Till dawn , my thought were all fantasies about Stacey and me . Somehow I was older , more dangerous , and driving a black Thunderbird . She got very excited each time I saved her from Dr. X. <p> That morning , nerves pulsing in my skin , I went to Petrie 's office on the chance I 'd meet Stacey . It turned out to be the last time I saw him . At one point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he looked up at me squirming in my seat and said , " You seem to be having side effects . I 'm canceling your prescription . " <p> Afterwards , as I should have known , there was no sign of Stacey . Things started to jump like on a bad TV and I saw a red MG out of the comer of my eye . When I turned , it was gone . Not wanting to be alone , I headed for the Gallery . <p> Joe might be there . He had once seen my Shadow . That Saturday , the place was busy . Lots of guys stood at the door . Kids had come from the pool wearing towels . I spotted Joe talking to one . He looked my way , amazed , like he saw double again . But he made the gesture indicating him and me . <p> As I stepped forward , Max appeared on my left . He had a bad gleam in his eyes . His hand was in his pocket . At my right hand was Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prior date ! " <p> " Joe ! " My shout got the Gallery 's attention . Guys peered out of alcoves . Dr. X got his hand over my mouth . Max snapped something and stuck it up to my nose . It smelled like sweaty socks . <p> " Amyl nitrite , " I heard Joe say as my head spun . Guys started zipping their flies ; boys edged away . " You 're hijacking the kid ! " <p> " I 'm a licensed psychiatrist , " Dr. X told him . " This is an escaped patient ? ' Their voices sounded like I was under water . Then the hands were gone from my face . <p> People started to run . A fleeing kid opened a fire door . An alarm began ringing . Someone yelled , " Raid ! " Fresh air rushed in and my head cleared . Max was on the floor with a bloody lip . <p> I saw that Joe had slammed Dr. X against a wall . " Get out ! " he yelled . Like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a while I just put distance between that place and myself . Finally , pain stabbed my side and I lay behind an empty loading dock in an alley . My heart would not stop pounding . My nose bled . I passed out wondering what had happened to Joe , who had fought for me . My Shadow said , " None of this would have happened if we 'd gone to visit Uncle Jim . " <p> Later I was awake and dry-heaving through the fence around the train yard . A cop car raced by and I tried to shrink into the sidewalk . My Shadow said , " Stacey told Dr. X where you 'd be . " All I wanted was to die . <p> Then I stood beneath an el with a steam whistle screaming inside my ears . A hand was in my pocket . Said my Shadow , " Take a red . Steady your head . " I tried to swallow dry-mouthed and choked on the pill . If Dr. X did n't kill me , I thought , my Shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pill and prescription onto a busy expressway . To exorcise my double , I chanted over and over , " Stay away from me . Stay away from me . " <p> Blood pounded like something was busting out of my brain . He whispered in my ear , " You 'll miss me while I 'm gone . " Later , huddled aching on a park bench , I spotted a flash of red . When I turned , there was no MG . My Shadow was gone and I felt empty . <p> On the roaring subway home I frantically searched the faces visible amid bags and boxes from Filene 's and Jordan 's , from Raymond 's and R.H. White 's . A woman on the first burst of Christmas shopping formed the word " Disgusting " as she and her friend stared at me . <p> At Queena Heaven it was cold and dark . My head spun as I tried to be sure everyone else off the train left the station ahead of me . Across the avenue , bodies glided , street light gleamed off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playground for the first skating of the year . <p> Crossing the street , I sat not far from a small fire on the shore . People warmed their hands . Little kids whose parents had forgotten about them slid by on their shoes . One old couple skated arm in arm . At the center of the ice , guys played freeform hockey . <p> It was important to pull myself together . I promised God a lifetime of monastic devotion if he would just make my head stay still . After a bit , my breathing slowed , the ringing in my ears died down , my brain slipped a cog or two . <p> Before me , goalies crouched in front of improvised nets . Pucks hissed , jumped on ice bumps . Bodies collided . A kid who had been my best friend in sixth grade skidded twenty feet on his back . <p> We barely nodded now . But seeing him evoked hot afternoons crouching shiftless waiting for grounders at third . More than memory , it was a dream which smeared time and circumstance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench . Walking up the hill I was going home to my parents . <p> Not my stepfather , my real father . He and my mother and I lived in my grandmother 's house . Just the three of us . I knew they would be standing outside in summer sunlight , she in her picture hat , he in his navy uniform . I would tell them about my Shadow . They would explain that it was a nightmare and I would rest easy in their arms . <p> Not even the sight of that house in darkness stopped my dream . Lights were on in the living room . From the front hall I saw my grandmother sitting on the couch with all the lamps lit and the family photos spread out before her . She had made tea . Laid out three cups . " Here he is after all ! " she exclaimed , like she and my parents had been worried . <p> I stepped into the room . " Kevin , " she said . " Dr. Exelman has been waiting for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X , as he moved between me and the door . " Did you forget about the overnight seminar ? " He wore horn-rimmed glasses I had never seen before . They helped mask the swelling of one of his eyes . His smile was vitamin enriched . <p> A battered suitcase from the upstairs closet stood next to the couch . " Dr. Exelman helped me pack a change of clothes and your tooth brush so you 'd be ready as soon as you came home , " My grandmother smiled brightly as I stood paralyzed . <p> " We had a long talk about you , how smart you are , " Dr. X chirped , " about your amazing family . Now , Mrs. Malloy , I 'm afraid we 're late . We have to hit the road . " He picked up the suitcase and stepped forward to put an arm around my shoulder . <p> " First , let me use the bathroom . " I ran upstairs . My thought was of the .38 . The door to the closet was ajar . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Reaching up , I pushed aside the imitation alligator binocular case , the bag full of Christmas ornaments . I tore through the shelf . <p> " No , the gun is n't there , " said Dr. X. " I remembered your mentioning it , so I looked . I also tried to find my property which you stole . " He stood at the head of the stairs . " You caused me considerable professional embarrassment , Kevin . Are you going to summon your imaginary friend ? I 'm ready . " " Get out of this house ! " I stood all alone . <p> Dr. X advanced slowly , speaking hypnotically . " You bad little boy . First you are going to return the vitamins and minerals you stole . Then you , and I hope your Doppelganger , are going to come out to the house for a little therapy . " <p> The back stairs were at the end of the hall . I edged toward them . " Stand still , Kevin , " Dr. X said softly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Granny . " He stepped forward and grabbed my arms . <p> Below , the front door opened and a voice called , " Mary ? Kevin ? " It was Aunt Tay . " Mary , do we have guests ? " <p> " Dr. Axelrod came by to take Kevin on a trip . They 're upstairs . " <p> Dr. X did n't hesitate . " Stacey 's the one who told me how to find you here . Told me to bring you back . " My body felt weightless as he propelled me down the stairs . <p> Before us in overcoat and suit , a hat set on her head , stood Aunt Tay . " Yes ? " she said in a voice which had quelled generations of graduate students . <p> " Pardon me , madam , " said Dr. X. " But young Kevin is due at an overnight seminar the school has organized . And I " <p> " Indeed ? " She looked at me . " Kevin ? " <p> I tried to speak . No sound came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " I 'm his guardian . " <p> " Ah , his Aunt Tay ! He 's mentioned you . His grandmother and I have already discussed this . " He started forward . I bobbed with him like a balloon . My grandmother stood at the living room door . These two women were so frail . I did n't want anything to happen to them . " If you will excuse me , madam , " said Dr. X , trying to move past her . <p> Aunt Tay did not step aside . Instead she looked at me and said , clear and steady : <p> <p> BY FELL NIGHT <p> My mouth would n't work . She repeated : <p> <p> BY FELL NIGHT <p> Again I could n't speak . " An interesting folk rite , " said Dr. X. " Perhaps <p> I can return someday and record it . " He made to move past her . Tay said : <p> <p> BY FELL NIGHT <p> And what sounded like my mother 's voice back when I was a little kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> <p> BY BLACK LIGHT <p> And I turned to see my grandmother answer , her voice young : <p> DOWN NARROW ROADS <p> When Tay said : <p> <p> BY CAT 'S SIGHT <p> My grandmother responded : <p> THROUGH TIMES HARD AS ROCK <p> Dr. X said , " This young man has prostituted himself . He stole pills and prescription pads . He needs treatment . " <p> <p> BY OWL 'S FLIGHT <p> Said Tay . My own voice way at the back of my throat was more a moan than anything as I answered along with my grandmother : <p> PAST FEAR THAT FREEZES BLOOD <p> " Ladies , " said Dr. X. " Kevin , here , is a most rare and fascinating case . Doppelganger syndrome . In other words , he has a double . " Giving no sign that she had heard , Tay chanted : <p> <p> BY MAIN MIGHT <p> Dr. X tugged at me but I would n't move . " Let me work with Key . . . . " Something crackled like ice breaking . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OVER NIGHTMARE 'S DARK BRIDGE <p> Tay never raised her voice : <p> <p> BY ALL RIGHT <p> Our final response was : <p> I WILL COME TO YOU <p> A silence followed . Dr. X tried to speak and could n't . My grandmother could . " My son is a police officer , " she said . " Get out of this house , or I 'll have you arrested . " <p> Tay stared stony faced . It took a long moment , but Dr. X finally let go of me and backed out the door . He made certain signs with his fingers like he was warding off evil spirits . <p> " Who was that ? " my grandmother asked as the door closed . Then she felt tired and went upstairs to rest . The last few days and the weeks before that and the months all the way back to summer caught up with me . I slumped against the wall . <p> Tay led me out to the kitchen , fed me bread and butter , hot soup and cocoa . She sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ca n't be so . But even if they are , I love you . " <p> I could n't reply . <p> " With your mother too , I called it Faileas . It was too much for her , poor pet . " <p> " Faileas ? " I got out the words with difficulty , my throat was so tight . <p> " A Shadow . Such as you have . Sometimes you should pay a little attention to what old women say . Not always , mind you . At my age , words whiz about in the head like bees . " <p> I looked at her , wanting more , and she asked , " Remember the story I used to tell about Prince Caoimin ? How at his birth all the small folk , the fairies good and bad , stood over his crib and hurled wishes at him ? One side wished him happy days , the other grievous nights , one side great wealth , the other bitter poverty , one the hand of the princess , the other lonely death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown up for such things . But think how it could be that there were just too many wishes for one tiny baby to handle . Maybe in their trying to win the wishing they put too great a burden on one small head . " <p> Once , I would have grown impatient . But this lady may have saved my life with a poem , so I listened . " When your mother was born , your grandmother knew she would have no more children . Your grandfather had won her with his brains and charm . But he had his black side , all drinking and violence . His sons are well enough but they feared and respected only that black side of him . <p> " Mary wanted something better for Ellen . She tried with my help to give her blessings . We thought we had succeeded . But your grandfather had his hand on her too . She was his favorite and deep in her lurked the very essence of him . It was the same when you were born . We wished but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she rose to take it off the flame , her step was a little unsteady . " All of us from myself to the Pope have two selves , good and bad . It 's the way we are . What was sad was to see your mother as pained as one who 's been cut in two , unable to be at peace until she died . " <p> When she sat back down , the house was absolutely silent . Maybe it was my Shadow 's being absent , maybe the drugs and terror were shock treatment . But at that moment I realized that my mother was never coming back . I remembered the two faces in the photo , smiling and apologetic and scowling and malign . Good and bad , both halves of her were dead . <p> That night , finally , I was able to cry for her . Right then , I cried for all poor souls who find themselves cut in two . I cried for my grandmother and for Tay and myself . I cried for drunks and users , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Sweet Jesus , that night I cried for us all . <p> PART THREE FOR THE next week or so , I was stunned by grief . The world was a distant rumor . At school , kids talked about applying to Harvard and MIT . My mourning was so delayed that no one but Tay recognized it . No Shadow dogged me , no red MG flickered at the comer of my eyes . Common sense should have kept me away , but stark loneliness drew me to the Y. <p> Saturday morning , the Gallery was silent and empty . As I paused , an iron hand grabbed my arm . Turning . I saw a raincoat and a long Irish face , a cop . " Looking for the pool , son ? " Jumping at the bait , I nodded eagerly . He led me to the locker room and said , " Another bathing beauty , " to a big man with a Y sweatsuit . <p> The trap sprang . They knew . With a sadist 's smile , the man pointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scared , I obeyed . They laughed when I shivered bare ass , unable to meet their eyes . " MOVE IT , LITTLE GIRL ! " I ran to the piss and chlorine stinking pool . <p> A hunting party of counselors in trunks waited there . They knocked me into the water and held me under . They cheered when I choked and stamped my hands when I tried to get out . A couple I knew from school or the Gallery . They were the worst . <p> Then they were gone . I heard their shouts as they turned the showers on a fully clothed kid who would n't strip . He saved me . Slipping , gasping , shinnying wet into pants , shoving on loafers , I grabbed my jacket , abandoned everything else and got away . <p> Coming home frozen and half drowned , I felt I could fall no lower . I was wrong . Uncle Jim stood in the kitchen washing dust off his hands . " Here he is , " Gramny said brightly . I was glad she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Jim did . " Enjoy your swim ? " he asked . All I wanted was to get to my room and lick my wounds . But sensing my weakness , he followed me into the hall . " Your Uncle Mike tells me they got a vice sweep on . " He saw me wince . <p> His breath was boozy as he said , " We got some matters to discuss . Like your future . " Noticing I was still damp , he added , " Maybe you should go in the navy , you like water so much . " <p> The navy sounded like three years worth of what had just happened to me . I was still shaking . " Let 's talk later , Jim . " <p> Angry , he always got quiet . But he never lost the smile . " Is it the dope that makes you not understand me ? We 're going to have a little walk and talk . " As with the man at the Y , I saw he meant me harm . And again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back door . His Caddy was parked at the end of the driveway . " You look like shit . I see you wasting your time in school . I want you to pre-enlist before graduation , not wait for the draft . I want it settled today . " <p> " My college boards are good enough . My mother said there was the money her father left . " I sounded pathetic . <p> We paused next to the fence at the end of the street and he said , " Like we 've been trying to tell you , there is no money . It got used up . On your mother . On other stuff . Understand ? " <p> Not knowing what to say , I just stared at him . Fast as a snake , the back of his hand caught the side of my face . My head bounced on the chain links . He hit me again . Far below , Boston Harbor spun . I tasted blood . <p> " Understand ? " he repeated . This time I managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time someone took you down a few pegs . " He hit me again . My head jerked back . <p> " You think I do n't know about your personal habits ? The goof balls ? About how you earn pocket money ? I look at you and I know . " With each question , he shook me . " Understand ? " <p> Instead of nodding I dodged . He hit me left-handed on the side of the head . My ear rang . " Big commotions here last week , " he said . " Morn let it slip about some guy looking for you . Shithead , keep your freak friends away from her and Tay . Understand ? " <p> I nodded but he smacked me anyway . " Understand ? " <p> " Yes , yes I understand . . . please do n't ! " <p> " And while you live in this house , which wo n't be for long , you keep your hands off what does n't belong to you . What did you do with that .38 ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It did n't come , though he did n't believe me . " There 's other stuff missing . Papers . More . . . . She forgets . Mom took your mother 's death hard . Me too . I 'm not letting you get like your mother . " Reflectively , Jim banged my head against the fence a couple of times . <p> He pushed me toward the car . " Get in . We got to do something about you . " I noticed Mrs. Reardon next door , a delivery boy from Snyder 's among others , observing with great interest the public display of my fall . Word would get around Queena Heaven . <p> The afternoon seemed flat and metallic , unreal even while it happened . Jim drove to Field 's Comer and brought me into his bar . We went back into his little office . " You could save us both trouble , if you knew about those documents . " My mind was frozen . I really did n't remember taking them . He gave me a whiskey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain in my mouth . " You got nothing on under your coat . What the hell 's wrong with you ? " <p> He made me put on a white shirt a few sizes too big . Then he took me to a barber who was an old army buddy . " Kevin is going in the service , " he announced as clippers ran over my temples . <p> Afterwards he stopped in another place to drink and place a couple of bets . I sat beside him in shock . The face in the bar mirror was no longer mine . <p> Jim 's beating was professional . The face was unbruised . But swelling had turned the eyes into narrow slits . The hair was gone except for a half-inch-high swath on top of the head . It was the face the Shadow had worn in the dream the week before . <p> Jim saw my expression . " Any further thoughts on what happened to the .38 ? " he asked . Once I remembered the dream , I knew where the gun was . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Jim knew just how to put someone over the edge . <p> At the recruiter 's office , the sergeant was another of Jim 's pals . I signed papers there too . The sergeant said it was good doing this now and that they 'd take me right after school . He gave me something for Tay to sign as my guardian . By then none of this mattered . <p> To make sure I had nothing to live for , Jim said as he dropped me off , " You 've been hiding behind women too long . Next weekend , I 'm moving you out of here to somewhere that I can keep an eye on you . Get Tay 's signature . Any whining to her and I 'll kick your ass . " <p> Tay was home when I walked in the door . " Oh , Kevin , " she said and other stuff . But my ears hummed and I did n't hear . What had happened hurt too much to tell her . My future was hell . But it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I fell face down on my bed and passed out . <p> When I awoke , it was deepest night . Confused , aching , Igot up and took off the unfamiliar shirt with prickly hairs down the back . Guys from school had seen me that morning . Nowhere in the city could I hold up my head . But I had the cure . <p> On my desk was a note from Tay , a plate of sandwiches and a glass of flat ginger ale . The note read : <p> <p> BY ALL RIGHT <p> I WILL COME TO YOU <p> It meant nothing to me . I could n't eat . But my thirst was intense , so I drank the soda . <p> The house was cold , silent . In my grungy jeans , I padded down the hall and opened the door of what had been my mother 's room . In the dream , my Shadow had said , " Her brothers are still afraid to go in there . " <p> Remembering , I lifted the mattress . There was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was load the revolver and blow off the side of my head . Picking it up , I saw a vial of pills . <p> " Shoot yourself , " said a voice behind me . " And you finish Jim 's work for him . Like our mother did . He set you up for this . Look , I laid something aside . A couple of those codeine will cut your pain . " <p> The magic my Shadow brought was black . But it was magic . " How 's life been without me ? " he asked . " Pool parties ? Manly outings with Uncle Jim ? Going to send me away ? No , huh . " <p> Back in my room , stoned , I held the revolver at the ready and looked in the mirror again . Instead of a face I did n't recognize , I saw a face that could be anyone : all-American boxer , army recruit , hired killer . And this time , I saw it twice . <p> I slept most of Sunday . Not wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could do was pat my hand . Monday morning on my way into school , I saw a familiar face . One of the guys from the Y pool . Hate twisted me . Standing in his path , I looked death into his eyes . By himself , he was frightened . And he should have been . I had a loaded .38 in my school bag . <p> In study hall that day , guys stared at me and whispered a story that was going around . I dropped Dexedrine and looked at the papers from my locker . I got scared , then angry . Documents ran from my grandfather to my mother , from my mother to me . I owned a share of the house and Jim was trying to throw me out . It seemed I owned a small part of his bar . Without Tay 's signature the army enlistment was worthless . <p> The Drama Society rehearsed after school . A couple of people looked at me strangely . Grebesky , a forward on the hockey team , was Mistress Quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't remember his lines . Nobody laughed as Mr. Royce , the drama advisor , kept prompting him . <p> In my ear , the voice said , " Early tomorrow , we 'll go visit Uncle Jim and have a little talk . " The thought made me uneasy . <p> Then I realized there was a stir on stage . " Take five , " said Mr. Royce . " Grierson , get down here . " <p> At first , I thought I 'd missed a cue . Wondering what the big deal was , I came off the stage into the gloom of the auditorium . And my eyes bugged . Royce stood in the center aisle . Stacey was with him . " Nothing to worry about , Grierson , " he said . " Your cousin assures me it 's just a minor family emergency . " <p> " They were really nice about letting me in , " said Stacey in an unfamiliar bright , chirping voice . She had on a blue dress with a Peter Pan collar . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smiled girlishly . " Sorry to take Kevin away , Mr. Royce . It was fascinating watching you direct . " <p> Royce stared at her , enchanted . Girls hardly ever entered the school . I could hear the guys on stage behind me , panting . It turned out we came from a real affectionate family . " Hey , cuz ! " I said and kissed Stacey on the mouth . <p> " Very good , Grierson , you can go . Try to pay more attention , " said Mr. Royce . As I picked up my coat and book bag he added roguishly , " . You never told me you had such a lovely cousin . " <p> " Right , " I muttered as we walked through the rotunda and out the door . " I can imagine that coming up in conversation . ' Do n't give me detention , sir , I have a lovely cousin . ' " <p> " He 's a filthy pervert , " Stacey said matter-of-factly . Out on the street , she glanced around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need your help . " <p> I was looking too . Now that she was n't putting on an act , Stacey seemed tense , desperate . I stayed cool . " What 's wrong ? " <p> " Dr. X. He 's up in New Hampshire , collecting money , drugs . He 's coming back tonight . Then he 's taking me to Mexico . " She took my hand . " Kevin , he 's crazy and I 'm scared . " <p> I wanted her . My life depended on it . But I just said , " Do n't go . " She shook her head . " It is n't that easy . Things are slightly out of control . My mother and stepfather are coming back next week . Dr. X threatens to stay in the house and confront them . My father has wanted to hospitalize me all along . If I ca n't straighten the situation out , my mother will let him . " <p> Because of how she had helped wreck my life , I said , " You told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lived and about the Gallery . " <p> " No , I said you were n't ready yet . And he forced me to tell . I was stuck in the god-damn oubliette . In my own house . You humiliated him and he took it out on me . Today he locked me in the bedroom but I got out . Kevin , I recognized something in you the first time we met . Seeing you now , I know you can get rid of Dr. X. " <p> I hesitated . But my Shadow whispered , " Dr. X is a punching bag . Tell her about your fee . " <p> " Before I get rid of Dr. X , " I told Stacey and used the same gesture Joe in the Gallery used to indicate the two of us . <p> She said , " You 're a creep . " But the deal was made . <p> Looking up and down the block , I asked , " Where 's the MG ? " <p> " Dr. X has it . He says it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get it back . " She started walking toward the streetcars and I followed . " When I first met him he seemed brilliant . After what you did to him , everything dried up , the drugs , his power . Everyone who hung around deserted . Even that toad Max . " <p> We did n't speak much on the steamy , crowded ear out to her mother 's house . Anticipation kept me hard and on edge . I watched Stacey . She was beautiful . There 's a brief time in youth when depravity does no more than refine the features . <p> By night her stop looked like something out of a European spy movie , gleaming tracks , frosted breath , figures walking in overcoats as faces at lighted windows moved past in the other direction . " In case this is a trap , " said the Shadow , and I slipped the revolver out of the bag into my overcoat pocket . <p> The house , it turned out , was dark and silent . Stacey picked up a half empty bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the master bedroom . We both took a swallow . As we undressed , I took deep sleeping breaths and watched Stacey . <p> In soft light , she stepped out of her dress and her shoes , undid the stockings and slipped them off . She took off her bra and slid out of her panties . She sat on the bed and beckoned . <p> I 'd dreamed this scene often . But all my experience was of people doing things with my body . Now that it was time to act , I smelled piss and chlorine , heard laughter . Remembering the shame , I froze . Those bastards that Saturday had crippled me . <p> " It 's easy . Maybe even fun , " my Shadow whispered . My hand brought up the bottle and I took a swig . My feet had trouble finding the floor . But Stacey wanted this to work . She put one hand on my waist , the other on my thigh , and guided me gently . When I came , it was a relief and wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point I felt like we were a pair of beating wings . I remember running my hands over every inch of her skin . I wanted , like I never had with anyone , to make Stacey want me . Caught in the moment , I forgot there was a meter running . <p> But Stacey did n't . The last thing she did was to kiss me long and hard on the throat just below my chin . " Something for those gorillas at school to see , " she whispered . Then she rose and I noticed that exactly half an hour had elapsed . <p> We smoked a cigarette , had some more whiskey . " Sorry to spoil things , " Stacey said , " but he 's going to be back soon . " We dressed and she got busy . <p> Dr. X had already begun to pack . She moved a suitcase and a cardboard box full of papers down to the front hall . " He can take his things . What I want out of him is all the keys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ever . " <p> We put most of the lights out and Stacey went back up to the bedroom . After a few minutes she put on a record , the Goldberg Variations . I sat on the stairs with the .38 . <p> Dr. X drove up fast . The car door slammed ; his key was in the front lock . For an instant I panicked . But my Shadow whispered , " This will be fun too . " My hands steadied as I slipped off the safety . <p> Dr. X flicked the switch in the front hall and the first thing he saw was his belongings . He looked flabby and flushed , like he had been drinking . Out of the darkness I said , " Good evening , Dr. X. " <p> It took him just a moment to recognize my voice . " You little pussy . She let you fuck her . Now she thinks you 're going to save her ? No witches to help you ? Weird kids like you disappear and nobody is at all surprised . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun . Dr. X faltered . My pulses jumped . " Stacey wants the keys back . Lay them down on the table and you can take all of this you can carry . Understand ? " <p> " I 'm taking the car , " he said and turned to leave . For a moment the gun was leveled at the back of his head . Then I raised it and squeezed hard . <p> WHAM ! The revolver jumped like a snake . The explosion and the impact of the bullet in the wall above his head were simultaneous . I had never fired a gun before . But I heard myself say , " That felt good ! " <p> Dr. X stood frozen . " Empty out your pockets . Understand ? " I said . He did n't jump fast enough . " UNDERSTAND ? " <p> When Stacey came out of the bedroom and stood at the head of the stairs , I had Dr. X lying face down on the floor . She went and called a taxi . <p> " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Dr. X. " But I also see you turning that gun on yourself unless you 're careful . I know what you 're really into , Kevin . Forget that spoiled bitch . You need a man like me . " <p> For a while , I listened appreciatively . I really had learned stuff from him , and he talked a great show . But he began to whine and I had to press the gun into the back of his head to shut him up . When the taxi came , I let him take his belongings . <p> As the taillights disappeared down the driveway , Stacey descended and looked at the hole in the wall . " Firing that gun was really stupid , " she said . " 1 hope I can get all this fixed up before Mother gets back . " <p> I unloaded the revolver , stuck it back inside the book bag . " I do n't even know his real name . " <p> " Botley , Herbert Botley . He taught freshman psych . " Stacey sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It occurred to me that it would be nice to be close to her again . Reaching out , I suggested , " Let 's go back upstairs . " <p> " That was n't part of the bargain . Do you let your customers have extras ? " Startled , I was silent . She showed me to the door without a kiss . " I 'm leaving right after you . Repairmen will be here in the morning . Do you need money to get home ? " <p> I shook my head . " Maybe I can call you . " <p> " I do n't think so , " Stacey said , dosing the door . <p> That just about broke my heart . At the same time I kind of admired how she had carried everything off . It was cold . I stuck my hands in my pockets and listened to my Shadow . <p> " Tomorrow we visit Uncle Jim . We go out early when he 's nice and hung over . Wait in the garage . Show him the gun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We want money and we want him to stay far away from us . But I do n't think that will be a problem . A bullet or two in the dashboard of his Caddy and he 'll cry real tears . " <p> I felt better about it than I had before . But I still was n't happy . " What about school ? " As we approached the station , a streetcar swung out of the dark a few hundred feet down the track . We picked up our pace . <p> " Forget school . Tay understands what 's happening . Or thinks she does . She 'll cover for us . Forget Boston . We should go to New York before Christmas . Find girls who make Stacey look like Grebesky . Sugar Daddies . Guys like Joe but rich . We should go to college there . " <p> It sounded good . We crossed the outward bound tracks as the streetcar stopped . My Shadow boarded right behind me . <p> <p> By Richard Bowes <p> Richard Bowes makes his third appearance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All three of his stories , which stand alone , are about Kevin Grierson at various points of his life , and all three will appear in Richard 's novel , Minions of the Moon .
