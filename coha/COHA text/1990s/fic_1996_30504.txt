January 14 , 2000 Seymour Island , Antarctic Peninsula There was a curse about the island . A curse proven by the graves of men who set foot on the forbidding shore , never to leave . Seymour Island made up the largest ice-free surface on or near the whole continent of Antarctica . It was a singularly ugly place , inhabited only by few varieties of lichen and a rookery of Adlie penguins . The majority of the dead , buried in shallow pits pried from the rocks , came from a Norwegian Antarctic expedition after their ship was crushed in the ice in 1859 . They survived two winters before their food supply ran out , finally dying off one by one from starvation . Lost for over a decade , their well-preserved bodies were not found until 1870 , by the British while they were setting up a whaling station . The restless ghosts of the explorers and sailors that roamed the forsaken ground could never have imagined that one day their resting place would be crawling with accountants , attorneys , plumbers , housewives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships to gawk at the inscribed stones and ogle the comical penguins that inhabited a piece of the shoreline . Perhaps , just perhaps , the island would lay its curse on these intruders too .... The impatient passengers aboard the cruise ship Polar Queen saw nothing ominous about Seymour Island . Safe in the comfort of their floating palace , they felt only excitement at a new experience , especially since they were among the first wave of tourists ever to walk the shores of Seymour Island . Many had traveled Europe and the Pacific , seen the usual exotic places travelers flock to around the world . Now they wanted something more , something different ; a visit to a destination few had seen before , a remote place they could set foot on and brag about to friends and neighbors afterward . As they clustered on the deck near the boarding ladder in happy anticipation of going ashore , aiming their telephoto lenses at the penguins , Maeve Fletcher walked among them , checking the bright orange insulated jackets passed out by the ship 's cruise staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship and shore . Maeve was three years shy of thirty , with a master 's degree in zoology . Energetic and in constant motion , she towered above the women and stood taller than most of the men . Her hair , braided in two long pigtails , was as yellow as a summery iris . She stared through eyes as blue as the deep sea , from a strong face with high cheekbones . Her lips always seemed parted in a warm smile , revealing a tiny gap in the center of her upper teeth . Tawny skin gave her a robust outdoorsy look . This trip there were ninety-one paying passengers on board , and Maeve was one of four naturalists who were to conduct the excursions on shore . Maeve was scheduled to accompany the first party of twenty-two visitors to the island . She checked off the list of names as the excited travelers stepped down the boarding ladder to a waiting Zodiac , the versatile rubber float craft designed by Jacques Cousteau . As she was about to follow the last passenger , the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boarding ladder . " Tell your people not to be alarmed if they see the ship sailing off , " he told her . She turned and looked up the steps at him . " Where will you be going ? " " There is a storm brewing a hundred miles out . The captain does n't want to risk exposing the passengers to any more rough water than necessary . Nor does he want to disappoint them by cutting short the shore excursions . He intends to steam twenty kilometers up the coast and drop off another group at the seal colony , then return in about two hours to pick you up and repeat the process . " " Putting twice the number ashore in half the time . " " That 's the idea . That way , we can pack up and leave and be in the relatively calm waters of the Bransfield Strait before the storm strikes here . You have your portable communicator should you encounter a problem . " Maeve held up the small unit that was attached to her belt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say hello to the penguins for me . " " I shall . " As the Zodiac skimmed over water that was as flat and reflective as , a mirror , Maeve lectured her little band of intrepid tourists on the history behind their destination . " Seymour Island was first sighted by James Clark Ross in 1842 . Forty Norwegian explorers , castaway when their ship was crushed in the ice , perished here in 1859 . We 'll visit the site where they lived until the end and then take a short walk to the hallowed ground where they are buried . " " Are those the buildings they lived in ? " asked a lady who must have been pushing eighty , pointing to several structures in a small bay . " No , " answered Maeve . " What you see are what remains of an abandoned British whaling station . We 'll visit it just before we take a short hike around that rocky point you see to the south , to the penguin rookery . " " Does anyone live on the island ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research station on the northern tip of the island . " " How far away ? " " About thirty kilometers . " They could see the bottom clearly , now , naked rock with no growth to be seen anywhere . Their shadow followed them about two fathoms down as they cruised through the bay . Maeve felt a tinge of regret she could n't quite understand as the yellow-and-white Polar Queen grew smaller in the distance . For a brief moment she experienced the apprehension the lost Norwegian explorers must have felt at seeing their only means of survival disappear . She quickly shook off any feelings of uneasiness and began leading her party across the gray moonscape to the cemetery . She allotted them twenty minutes to pick their way among the tombstones , shooting rolls of film of the inscriptions . Then she herded them around a vast pile of giant bleached whale bones near the old station while describing the methods the whalers used to process the whales . " After the danger and exhilaration of the chase and kill , " she explained , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blubber into oil . ' Cutting in ' and ' trying out , ' as the old-timers called it . " Next came the antiquated huts and rendering building . The whaling station was still maintained and monitored on an annual basis by the British and was considered a museum of the past . Furnishings , cooking utensils in the kitchen , along with old books and worn magazines , were still there just as the whalers left them when they finally departed for home . " Please do not disturb any of the artifacts , " Maeve told the group . " Under international law nothing may be removed . " She took a moment to count heads . Then she said , " Now I 'll lead you into the caves dug by the whalers , where they stored the oil in huge casks before shipping it to England . " From a box left at the entrance to the caves by expedition leaders from previous cruises , she passed out flashlights . " Is there anyone who suffers from claustrophobia ? " One woman who looked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm afraid I do n't want to go in there . " " Anyone else ? " The woman who asked all the questions nodded . " I ca n't stand cold , dark places . " " All right , " said Maeve . " The two of you wait here . I 'll conduct the rest a short distance to the whale-oil storage area . We wo n't be more than fifteen minutes . " She led the group through a long , curving tunnel carved by the whalers to a large storage cavern stacked with huge casks that had been assembled deep inside the rock and later left behind . After they entered she stopped and gestured at a massive rock at the entrance . " The rock you see here was cut from inside the cavern and acts as a barrier against the cold and to keep competing whalers from pilfering surplus oil that remained after the station closed down for the winter . This rock weighs as much as an armored tank , but a child can move it , providing he or she knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed her hand on a particular place on the upper side of the rock and easily pushed it the entrance . " An ingenious bit of engineering . The rock is delicately balanced on a shaft through its middle . Push in the wrong spot and it wo n't budge . " Everyone made jokes about the total darkness broken only by the flashlights as Maeve moved over to one of the great wooden casks . One had remained half full , and she held a small glass vial under a spigot and filled it with a small amount of oil . She passed the vial around , allowing the tourists to rub a few drops between their fingers . " Amazingly , the cold has prevented the oil from spoiling , even after nearly a hundred and thirty years . It 's still as fresh as the day it came from the cauldron and was poured into the cask  --  " Maeve was abruptly cut off by the scream of an elderly woman who frantically clutched the sides of her head . Six other people followed suit , the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to the other , stunned at the look of intense pain in their eyes . " What is it ? " she shouted . " What 's wrong ? Can I help you ? " Then suddenly it was her turn . A daggerlike thrust of pain plunged into her brain , and her heart began to pound erratically . Instinctively her hands pressed her temples . Then she was struck by a tidal wave of dizziness rapidly followed by great nausea . She fought an overwhelming urge to vomit before losing all balance and falling down . No one could understand what was happening . The air became heavy and hard to breathe . The beams of the flashlights took on an unearthly bluish glow . There was no vibration , no shaking of the earth , and yet dust began to swirl inside the cavern . Everyone began to sag and fall to the ground . One moment people stared at death from an unknown source . Then inexplicably , an instant later , the excruciating agony and vertigo began to ease . As quickly as it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted to her bones . She leaned weakly against the cask of whale oil , eyes closed , vastly relieved at being free of pain . No one found the voice to speak for nearly two minutes . Finally , a man , who was cradling his stunned wife in his arms , looked up at Maeve . " What was that ? " Maeve slowly shook her head . " I do n't know , " she answered dully . With great effort she made the rounds , greatly cheered at finding everyone still alive . They all appeared to be recovering with no lingering effects . Maeve was thankful that none of the more elderly had suffered permanent damage , especially heart attacks . " Please wait here and rest while I check the two ladies at the entrance of the tunnel and contact the ship . " She swung open the massive door and walked through the portal until the beam of her flashlight vanished around a curve in the tunnel . As soon as Maeve reached daylight again , she could n't help wondering if it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blue . The sun had risen a little higher in a cloudless sky . And the two ladies who had preferred to remain in the open air were lying sprawled on their stomachs , each clutching at nearby rocks as if trying to keep from being torn away by some unseen force . She bent down and tried to shake them awake but stiffened in horror when she saw the sightless eyes and the gaping mouths . They were dead . Maeve ran down to the Zodiac , which was still sitting with its bow pulled onto the shoreline . The crewman who had brought them ashore was also lifeless , the same appalling expression on his face . In numbed shock , Maeve lifted her portable communicator and began transmitting . " Polar Queen , this is land expedition one . We have an emergency . Please answer immediately . Over . " There was no reply . She tried again and again to raise the ship . Her only response was silence . It was as if Polar Queen and her crew and passengers had never existed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
