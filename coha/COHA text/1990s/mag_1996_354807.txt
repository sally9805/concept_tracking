LAST TUESDAY AFTERNOON , RON BROWN found himself with some time to spare in Paris before flying on to the Balkans . So he went over to the U.S. embassy and engaged Ambassador Pamela Harriman in a stroll along the Seine . As they walked and chatted , the Commerce Secretary could barely contain his enthusiasm over a scheme he had just cooked up involving 200 Big Macs , which he had managed to persuade a McDonald 's manager in Croatia to give him , free of charge . His plan was to pick up the burgers in Zagreb , fly them to Tuzla and pass them out to the U.S. troops he would be visiting . That gesture was pure Ron Brown : part theater , part business , with an eye on self-interest and a generous touch . <P> The purpose of Brown 's trip was to demonstrate U.S. support for the peacekeeping effort in the Balkans , as well as to lobby on behalf of the 12 American industry leaders in his delegation who hoped to grab a piece of $5 billion in reconstruction aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his party spent the night in Zagreb , then proceeded to Tuzla , where the Secretary delivered his Big Macs . The troops were thrilled . Then around 2 p.m. , Brown 's entourage boarded an Air Force T-43 for the coastal town of Dubrovnik , where one of the worst storms in a decade was raging . <P> Just after 3 p.m. , the plane suddenly disappeared from the radar screens in the Dubrovnik control tower . It was more than four hours before the truth emerged : the aircraft had slammed into a rocky hilltop nearly two miles from the airport . With the exception of a fatally injured flight attendant who died on the helicopter ride to a nearby hospital , every passenger was dead by the time Croatian rescue teams reached the site of the crash . <P> In Washington , a city famous for counterfeit displays of emotion , Brown 's demise at the age of 54 immediately transformed the corridors of power into a theater of genuine shock and grief . And as his sea of mourners gathered at one another 's homes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life : a fan of Hermes ties who liked to dine in deep-fry joints ; a defender of the little people who enjoyed being chauffeured around in limousines ; a dealmaker who could talk policy ( if only to better horse-trade on Capitol Hill ) ; a big-time Washington lawyer who never gave up public service ; a man of conviction who often skirted the ethical edge ; a keenly optimistic black man in the white establishment . His resume contained a gold-plated series of civil rights achievements , even if he refused to let them define him only in terms of race : first black chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee ; one of the first black partners in his Washington law firm ; first black Democratic Party chairman . There were many other firsts as well . <P> The morning after the crash , U.S. Army Brigadier General Michael Canavan phoned from Dubrovnik to inform Harold Ickes , Clinton 's deputy chief of staff , that Brown 's body had finally been identified . Famous for his steeliness , Ickes opened the 8:30 a.m . White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call for business as usual . But within minutes he had turned the meeting into an impromptu wake , with staff members swapping fond anecdotes and roguish tales , all of them rich in laughter and full of deep pride in Brown . Even Ickes told one .
