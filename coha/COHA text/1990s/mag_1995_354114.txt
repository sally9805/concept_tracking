THE GEEKS HAVE A WORD FOR IT : vaporware . That 's what the computer industry calls hopeful promises offered in place of slow-to-materialize products , whether hardware or software . And while there 's nothing especially vaporous about the 26-year-old global computer network known as the Internet , the estimates of its size that have been tossed around during its meteoric rise to celebrity over the past two years have been pretty mushy . As seemingly straightforward a question as how many people use the network has produced answers that range from 3 million to 60 million . Most of those numbers are little more than guesses , some highly educated , some less so . But none are substitutes for the statistically defensible research demanded by investors and publishers who view the Net as a fast-growing market and a new communications medium . <P> Last week , though , the hard data finally arrived . Nielsen Media Research  --  the folks who do the famous Nielsen TV ratings  --  unveiled the results of what seems to be the first solid , scientific survey of the Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. and Canada . Most earlier surveys relied on figures obtained through questionnaires or by counting the number of Internet host computers and multiplying that by an estimated number of users per host  --  a fudge factor that is particularly difficult to measure when an Internet host computer can be anything from a single workstation to a gateway computer serving an entire university . <P> The Nielsen survey , by contrast , used the same random phone-calling techniques employed by political pollsters and marketing firms . Commissioned by CommerceNet , an industry consortium looking to boost business online , the study was based on interviews with more than 4,200 North American households  --  a sample that experts say is large enough to be taken seriously . <P> For those who had staked their reputations  --  not to mention their assets  --  on the assumption that the Internet was a lot bigger than the pessimists said , the news was good . According to Nielsen , approximately 37 million people in the U.S. and Canada have access to the Net  --  either direct or through a friend , a colleague or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Online . That 's more than the number of TV viewers who tune in to ER each week . Some 24 million people used the Internet during the past three months  --  a number that represents 11% of the population 16 and older . On average , those users logged nearly 5 1/2 hours online each week ; some of that time was undoubtedly taken out of hours they would have spent watching TV . <P> The news that the Internet is fast approaching mass-market proportions was well received on Wall Street , which has been gambling wildly on Internet-related stocks in recent months . Shares of companies with an Internet connection  --  any Internet connection  --  jumped sharply last week . America Online , which declared its third stock split in a year , closed up 12 3/4 points for the week , representing an increase of more than 470% in the past 12 months .
