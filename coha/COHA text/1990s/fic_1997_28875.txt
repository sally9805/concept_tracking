Everything and the Moon Chapter OneKent , England June , 1809 Robert Kemble , earl of Macclesfield , had never been given to flights of fancy , but when he saw the girl by the lake , he fell instantly in love . It was n't her beauty . With her black hair and pert nose she was certainly attractive , but he 'd seen women far more beautiful in the ballrooms of London . It was n't her intelligence . He had no reason to believe that she was stupid , but as he had n't shared two words with her , he could n't vouch for her intellect either . It certainly was n't her grace . His first glimpse of her came as she flailed her arms and slipped off a wet rock . She landed on another rock with a loud thump , followed by an equally loud " Oh , bother " as she stood and rubbed her sore backside . He could n't put his finger on it . All he knew was that she was perfect . He moved forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of stepping from one stone to another , and any fool could see that she was going to slip , because the stone she was stepping onto was slick with moss , and Splash ! " Oh dear oh dear oh dear oh dear ! " Robert could n't help but grin as she ignominiously hauled herself to the shore . The hem of her dress was soaked , and her slippers had to be ruined . He leaned forward , noticing that her slippers were sitting in the sun , presumably where she 'd left them before hopping from stone to stone . Smart girl , he thought approvingly . She sat down on the grassy bank and began to wring out her dress , offering Robert a delicious view of her bare calves . Where had she stashed her stockings , he wondered . And then , as if guided by that sixth sense only females seemed to possess , she jerked her head up sharply and looked about . " Robert ? " she called out . " Robert ! I know you 're there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her before , certain they 'd never been introduced , and even more certain that even if they had , she 'd not be calling him by his given name . " Robert , " she said , fairly yelling at him now . " I insist you show yourself . " He stepped forward . " As you wish , my lady . " He said this with a courtly bow . Her mouth fell open . She blinked and scrambled to her feet . Then she must have realized that she was still holding the hem of her dress in her hands , baring her knees for all the world to see . She dropped the dress . " Who the devil are you ? " He offered her his best lopsided smile . " Robert . " " You are not Robert , " she spluttered . " I beg to differ with you , " he said , not even trying to contain his amusement . " Well , you 're not my Robert . " An unexpected surge of jealousy raced through him . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's ... I fail to see how that is your concern . " Robert cocked his head , pretending to give the matter ample thought . " One might be able to broach the argument that since this is my land and your skirts are soaked with water from my pond , then it is indeed my concern . " The color drained from her face . " Oh , dear Lord , you 're not his lordship . " He grinned . " I 'm his lordship . " " But , but his lordship is supposed to be old ! " She looked most perplexed and rather distraught . " Ah . I see our problem . I 'm his lordship 's son . The other his lordship . And you are ... ? " " In big trouble , " she blurted out . He took her hand , which she had not held out to him , and bowed over it . " I am extremely honored to make your acquaintance , Miss Trouble . " She giggled . " My name is Miss Big Trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any doubts about the perfection of the woman standing before him , they melted away under the force of her smile and obvious sense of humor . " Very well , " he said . " Miss Big Trouble . I should n't want to be impolite and deprive you of your full name . " He tugged on her hand and led her back to the bank . " Come , let us sit awhile . " She appeared hesitant . " My mother , bless her soul , passed on three years ago , but I have a feeling she would have told me that this is a most inadvisable idea . You look as if you might be something of a rake . " This caught his attention . " And have you met many rakes ? " " No , of course not . But if I were to meet one , I should think he would look rather like you . " " And why is that ? " She quirked her lips in a rather knowing expression . " Come now , are you looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He smiled over at her , sat down , and patted the ground next to him . " There is no need to worry . My reputation is not so very black . More of a charcoal gray . " She giggled again , causing Robert to feel as if he must be King of the Universe . " My name is actually Miss Lyndon , " she said , sitting beside him . He leaned back , resting on his elbows . " Miss Big Trouble Lyndon , I presume ? " " My father certainly thinks so , " she replied pertly . Then her face fell . " I really should go . If he caught me here with you . . . " " Nonsense , " Robert said , suddenly desperate to keep her there beside him . " There is no one about . " She sat back , her manner still somewhat hesitant . After a long pause she finally said , " Is your name truly Robert ? " " Truly . " " I imagine the son of a marquess would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid so . " She sighed dramatically . " Poor me . I have but two . " " And they are ? " She looked sideways at him , the expression in her eyes most definitely flirtatious . Robert 's heart soared . " Victoria Mary , " she replied . " And you ? If I may be so bold to ask . " " You may . Robert Phillip Arthur Kemble . " " You forgot your title , " she reminded him . He leaned toward her and whispered , " I did n't want to scare you . " Oh , I 'm not that easily frightened . " " Very well . Earl of Macclesfield , but it 's only a courtesy title . " " Ah , yes , " Victoria said . " You do n't get a real title until your father dies . Aristocrats are an odd lot . " He raised his brows . " Such sentiments could probably still get one arrested in some parts ...             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
