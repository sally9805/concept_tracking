PERFORMER : BARBRA STREISAND <P> ALBUM : BACK TO BROADWAY <P> LABEL : COLUMBIA <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : The singer follows up her smash 1985 album of show tunes with / an even smarter , sharper collection . <P> Barbra Streisand does n't sing , she emotes . She ascends octaves with the zeal of a new initiate in a 12-step program . She deconstructs melodies and remakes them in her own image ( she once asked Stephen Sondheim to rewrite Send in the Clowns ) . She tends to avoid singing one note when three or eight will do . All her emotions are bigger than life  --  bigger than the afterlife if you include On a Clear Day You Can See Forever  --  and every sentiment seems to end in multiple exclamation marks . <P> In other words , Streisand and Broadway are a perfect match . She launched her career in 1962 with a debut in the musical I Can Get It for You Wholesale and springboarded to the movies after her starring role in 1964 's Funny Girl . In 1985 she scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of songs by such composers as Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein . Her non-Broadway hits have never been very credible , and they 've proved to have the shelf life of sugary foodstuffs on convenience-store shelves . It 's hard to listen to You Do n't Bring Me Flowers , her 1977 duet with Neil Diamond , without thinking of eight-track tapes and the Carter Administration . <P> Back to Broadway is full of songs that are crafted to stand the test of time  --  and to some extent already have . Streisand 's voice glides through Johnny Mandel 's elegant orchestration of Some Enchanted Evening like a glamorous tourist passing through the lobby of a grand hotel . She follows that up with a no-frills version of Everybody Says Do n't ( from Anyone Can Whistle ) performed as an unabashed , up-with-people showstopper . When Streisand hollers , " I insist on miracles , if you do them/ Miracles  --  nothing to them ! " a listener is compelled to believe that this amazing woman  --  who has won a trunkful of Oscars , Tonys and Grammys  --  knows a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> If this album has a failing , it 's that Streisand 's song selection is a bit too classic and safe . She includes two songs from Guys and Dolls despite the fact that she did one from that show on her first Broadway album . She closes with a tune from Sunday in the Park with George despite the fact that her first album started off with a song from that show . Back to Broadway 's idea of adventure seems to be the inclusion of two Andrew Lloyd Webber songs from his yet-to-open musical adaptation of the film Sunset Boulevard . There 's also a version of Webber 's song The Music of the Night from The Phantom of the Opera , $ recast as a duet between Streisand and Michael Crawford . Three Webber songs is four too many . <P> There 's a lot more of Broadway that Streisand could and should explore . It would have been a welcome touch to include selections from more adventurous productions such as the jazzy Jelly 's Last Jam or maybe the AIDS musical Falsettos . Streisand 's return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a three-peat . Perhaps this is just her early theater training showing through : Always leave them wanting more .
