COVER STORY The First Lady no one knows . <p> I confess I 've always had a soft spot for Hillary Rodham Clinton . But then , asked to name my favorite Marx Brother , I usually cite Margaret Dumont . In A Night at the Opera and A Night in Casablanca , she was the haughty , imperious grande dame standing on her dignity while Groucho prowled around , waggling his cigar at every other woman in sight . The rock , the anchor of every great double-act is always the straight man , and the best straight man-or woman-is one who never really gets the joke in the first place . <p> And so it goes in that long-running gag-fest Two Terms at the White House : Like Groucho , the leering Clinto waggles his ( unlit ) cigar and staggers from one catastrophe to another , but through it all Hillary Rodham Dumont remains ever more serene and queenly . It 's a magnificent performance , and harder than it looks : While most of the country seems content to have a president who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pretending that the thongs and DNA are n't there . To the public , Bill 's the funny one , with his amusing pants-drops and distinguishing characteristics . But , to old showbiz pros , to connoisseurs , that kind of shtick 's a little obvious : The genius in the act is Hillary . Not many of us would relish having to stand in front of an audience and crank out the same old lines night after night at rally after rally , in the stilted cadences of that computerized voice in your car that tells you to fasten your seat belt : " I. Am . So . Proud . Of . My . Husband . And . Our . President . Bill . Clinton . " <p> One can sympathize with Mrs. Clinton 's frustrations , but even so she seems determined on a huge gamble : The stooge has decided to step out as a solo act , a star in her own right . The precedents are hardly encouraging . True , Dean Martin made it after Jerry Lewis , but the First Lady does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazingly , she 's all but decided to run for New York 's Senate seat . Local Democratic-party bigshots are deliriously egging her on with cries of " Six more years ! " HER TIME TO SHINE ? <p> Now you might disagree with my take , but that 's okay . With the First Lady , you can fumble around but you can never really get a firm grip on her : She remains all things to all men , unlike her husband , to whom all women are all things . To me , she 's Margaret Dumont . To the American people , she 's the beloved First Doormat . To those feminists who drove around with " I 'm Voting for Hillary 's Husband " stickers , she 's always been the star : It 's just taken the rest of us a while to figure it out . But now we 're ready , and so 's she . It 's Tina after Ike ! Cher after Sonny ! The diva without the dork ! Or , at any rate , Ethel Merman at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own life to promote a child prodigy who 'll never grow up : " What did it get me ? Scrapbooks full of me in the background . " Not anymore . The First Lady is stepping into the spotlight to claim her due : " This time-for me ! " <p> And who can blame her ? To the investigators in Ken Starr 's office , she 's always been the brains of the Clinton operation . In It Takes a Village , the account of her first steps in breast-feeding is prefaced by an aphorism : " We learn the rope of life by untying its knots . " Mrs. Clinton 's trick was in preventing the rope of her life from unraveling completely : Though one might detect a pattern of behavior from that long-ago Arkansas land deal to the firing of the travel-office staff , she was too clever to leave any fingerprints . Unfortunately , the chief executive of Clinton Scandals , Inc. , left her husband in charge of one small branch office : sex . And , sadly , Mr. Clinton 's small branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , the president left a trail of fingerprints and more on everything and everyone he touched . In the biographical dictionaries , instead of a few vague references somewhere in the 15th paragraph to " controversies surrounding their financial affairs , " the entry for William Jefferson Clinton will now begin : " Second president to be impeached . " His hapless consort 's only chance of rewriting history is to gamble on double or quits : " William Jefferson Clinton , 42nd president , now best remembered as husband of 44th president , Hillary Rodham ( q.v . ) . " <p> But , if you do n't buy the First Doormat or First Feminist , how about this ? To Tony Blair , in one of his creepier bits of sucking-up ( even by his standards ) , she 's another Princess Di . The two women shared , apparently , the same " qualities of dignity and grace . " At the White House banquet at which he made the observation , the thought hung awkwardly in the air , it being perfectly obvious that the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they 're both strong women married to wimpy , weak-willed adulterers . But try to picture Princess Hill demurely fluttering her kohl-ringed eyes and murmuring , " Well , um , you see it was all a bit difficult because there were really three of us in this marriage " - actually , for the Clintons , make that 33 . <p> No , if Mrs. Clinton 's a princess of any kind , she 's a pre-Diana royal duchess . In Britain , Bagehot advised the Royal Family not to let " daylight in on the magic , " something that 's proved all but impossible in an age of forensic media scrutiny . But Mrs. Clinton has managed it : She 's spent her entire adult life in public , and yet the mystery has been illuminated by not a shaft of daylight . Indeed , media deference in the United States is curiously reminiscent of that in Britain up to 20 years ago , when lame , awkward attempts at humor by , say , Princess Alexandra or the Duchess of Gloucester were fawningly hailed as evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bill Clinton has discussed his boxers and briefs on TV ; taken his penis along to a naval surgeon to be examined for the Paula Jones suit ; and had his semen processed by the FBI crime lab . Now imagine asking Hillary what kind of bra she wears . We know everything about Bill Clinton except an inkling of what his wife is like . After a year of unparalleled public scrutiny , the truth of their marriage is more unknown and unknowable than ever . Is it , as longtime friend Sen. Dale Bumpers suggested , that Hillary was blissfully unaware of Bill 's lapses ? The First Family , roared the old Ozark hogswill peddler in a teary speech during the president 's trial , " has already been about as decimated as a family can get There 's been nothing but mental agony , sleepless nights " Maybe he 's right , but who knows ? Maybe back home Bill and Hill were watching ol ' Dale and weeping with laughter . TRUE CLINTONISM <p> " We all have a little Clinton in us , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask itself right now is whether any of us really need a little more . The Clintonistas ( and there are still quite a few of them out there ) are beginning to come on like those old-time Soviet Communists who used to insist that , despite all its evident failures , there was nothing wrong with Communism : We just had n't had the right type of Communism . Likewise , we 're told after eight years , there 's nothing wrong with Clintonism : We just have n't had the right Clinton . It is , in its way , an audacious plan : an artful way to dodge the Twenty-Second Amendment and ensure that the Clinton era stretches lazily into the new millennium , to the 2008 presidential election and beyond . If it works , it will at least legitimize retrospectively Hillary 's tenure as First Lady . This is the only country in the Western world in which the consort of the head of government is given a semiformal role , an office , and a staff . Mrs. Clinton 's presence in the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president . If that marriage is a sleazy travesty of what most Americans , even today , understand by the term , then Hillary Rodham Clinton is not merely the most pathetic First Lady in history but also the most illegitimate First Lady . <p> For a year , Mrs. Clinton provided the respectable cover for the people 's torpor : " If Hillary does n't care , " they told pollsters , " why should we ? " Some went farther . The Republicans , wrote Susan Ager in the Detroit Free Press , " are punishing Bill Clinton for thrusting upon America a First Lady who is smart , gutsy , accomplished and opinionated . " <p> Mr. Clinton has certainly been thrusting upon America , but the First Lady is one of his less successful efforts . " Smart " ? How many other smart women would let themselves be maneuvered into posterity as a creepy psychological case study in denial and displacement ? " Gutsy " ? Undoubtedly . She pioneered the White House scorched-earth policy , assailing her husband 's accusers as " a vast right-wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-wing conspiracy , it seems most likely to turn out to be a cunning plan to plant an oral-sex fiend in the Oval Office who 's too busy being serviced or sued by subordinates to attend to his left-wing wife 's schemes for mandatory federalized child care . " Accomplished " ? Well , sadly , between the sex and the lawyers ' meetings and golf with Vernon Jordan , the Clinton presidency ran out of time to accomplish things : That 's the problem with trying to promote your agenda through a more popular , likeable partner . " Opinionated " ? Absolutely . Mrs. Clinton has publicly come out in favor of a Palestinian state , not exactly a surefire winner in a New York Senate campaign . <p> Still , for now only two obstacles stand in her path . The first is the soi-disant " feral New York media " : The First Lady could suddenly find herself facing brutal , searing questions like , " Mrs. Clinton , do you think part of the reason for this vast right-wing conspiracy is that many Americans still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart , gutsy , accomplished , and opinionated ? " " I 'm glad you asked me that , Katie " The New York Times , for one , has already lapsed instinctively into the same disapproving tone of moral equivalence that distinguished much of its Cold War coverage . The First Lady and Mayor Giuliani : She 's " controversial , " but so 's he ; she inspires as much enmity as affection , but so does he ; she 's ruthless and unforgiving towards her enemies , but so 's he ; she has n't been hit on by Bill Clinton recently , but neither has he . On the other hand , she looks good in pants , while he looks better in Julie Andrews 's dress . So at least the voters will have a clear choice on something . <p> The other obstacle is the people of New York , renowned for their tough , in-your-face savvy . They 're not like those patsies in New Zealand , to whom Mrs. Clinton revealed , concerning the distinctive spelling of her first name , that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everest . Those schmucko losers Down Under lapped it up , at least until the great man pointed out that he had n't conquered Everest until 1953 : Hillary Rodham was born in 1947 , when Sir Edmund was an obscure New Zealand beekeeper and an unlikely inspiration for young parents in a Chicago suburb . If she tries that sappy stuff in the Empire State , she 'd better make sure it 's a beekeeper from Plattsburgh or Binghamton . <p> But by then it 'll all be over . Nothing in Hillary 's past suggests anything other than a tin ear for democratic politics . It was the First Lady , remember , who advised her husband to come down tough on Ken Starr in his speech to the nation after his grand-jury deposition last August . For three minutes , the public got a glimpse of the real Bill Clinton-petulant , vengeful , unrepentant-and his presidency briefly trembled . This is the woman who paid tribute to the murdered Yitzhak Rabin by recalling how , during negotiations with Yassir Arafat , she was generous enough to offer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her smoke-free White House policy , if it were really , truly important to Middle East peace . Now there 's tolerance for you . <p> The cruel fact is that , whenever the citizenry have been exposed to the smart , gutsy , accomplished , opinionated side of Hillary , they 've recoiled in horror . She has a basic likeability problem , an observation I offer not in a mean-spirited partisan way because , God knows , the GOP 's got it in spades . But she 's the one woman President Clinton will never have to say " You might want to put some ice on that " to . She puts ice on everyone else : In the hurly-burly of a Senate race , she 'll be frosting up the room at a hundred paces . If the Democrats want to nail their colors to the Clinton mast yet again , let them go ahead . Even the Republicans may not screw this one up . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> By MARK STEYN <p> <p> Mr. Steyn is a columnist for Britain 's Daily Telegraph and Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
