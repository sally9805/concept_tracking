Orde stood atop the flat stone in Garber Park  --  talking . It had been four years since I 'd cut my wrists . I still carried my woodbound book , but the tide had changed to The History of the Coming of Light . " You are but a base stock . " Orde spoke in a commanding but intimate voice . It was drizzling on and off that day , so his audience was smaller than usual  --  fewer than eighty of his open-air congregation were there . Winos and unemployed clerks , dark-skinned nannies and their wealthy charges , the few blue novitiates ( those who learned from the light but had not witnessed it ) , including me . And Miles Barber . Miles was a homicide detective who dropped by about every other week or so . He usually came after the sermon . He did n't seem to like hearing Orde 's words . Barber was investigating the deaths of Mary Klee , Carla MacIlvey , Janet Wong , and a man whom people in the park knew only as Bruce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had privately nicknamed Mack the Flask . They were also regulars at Orde 's sermons , friends of mine . Among the first friends I 'd ever known . " You are but a base stock , " Orde said again . " Vegetables cooked down in an earthen pot . Soup with only the slightest hint of flavor left . One after the other there is no difference in you . You live and die , come together and fall apart , you have children and give them empty names . You are barely there and fast dissipating ; like the shit in a chamber pot spilled in the sea , you are flotsam having found your way to the edge of a decaying pier . " Everyone stood close around Orde 's stumplike rock . For all Orde 's certainty , his voice was soft . His followers , acolytes , and devoted friends found that they had to push closely together to hear the words . Down in Berkeley , even in the city , they called us the Close Congregation . We crowded together because the sermons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his words that we clung to one another as if we were holding on to his voice . We were lulled and exalted because in some way the truth he told was him , not just some abstract idea . " You 're way out from the heart of your origin , cut off from the bloodline that could provide the nutrients of true life . You are dying , unpollenated flowers . " Orde looked around with a kindly expression . " Your death means nothing . Your lives are less important than spit on the sidewalk . I ca n't even call you the seeds of something larger , better . You , who call yourselves living , are really nothing but the dead flakes of skin that some great shedding beast has left in his wake . The pattern of life is in you , but it is inert and decaying .... " It seemed true to me . I felt lifeless ; I felt inconsequential . Just months after his bout with the blue light , Orde had come upon me in the quad at Berkeley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that it was true . " You are born dying and so are your children . And even though your leaders claim that you are making advances through the generations , you know in your heart that it is n't true . You get better at making mechanical things , chemical things , but you ca n't make better art . You ca n't understand the real in even a stone . The stone exists , but if I were to ask you what it was , what it really was , you would n't even understand the question . And if you did understand , you would pull out pencil and paper , microscope and atom smasher to try and answer . You would attempt in words to explain that it would be impossible to know the nature of being stone . " A breeze kicked up just then . Orde raised his head and smiled . " You would be better off putting your finger to the wind , my friends . Lick your fingers , everybody , " he said . Most of us did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top to bottom . I still remember the first time I did this exercise for Orde . I held up my hand and felt that most familiar and exquisite sensation . The air cooling my finger , drying it and moving on into the sky with the moisture of my life . I was desperate back then . " It feels good , does n't it ? " Orde asked . Many nodded . " It 's like the cold kiss of a spirit beyond your ability to see . You can feel her only for a brief moment and then she 's off . " We nodded some more . " You are lost , " Orde said . He stepped off his rock , walked into the crowd , cleaving the congregation , and went up into the trees . Feldman and Alexander , two of Orde 's larger acolytes , blocked the way to anybody who wanted to follow him . He would be gone for the rest of the day . He 'd probably go down to San Francisco , in the secondhand brown suit I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was time to look for a mate again . Many of the Close Congregation followed him up to the point of the large carob trees into which he disappeared . They pressed up against the large bodyguards and called out , " Orde ! Teacher ! " I did n't go running after him . I had been with Orde for nearly four years by then . I 'd left everything behind me and joined the Close Congregation . Orde and his words were my only connection left to life . The day we met I 'd intended to kill myself . I 'd been with him ever since . I knew he 'd be back . I was one of the few who knew where he lived in town . I collected donations from the Close Congregation , kept his bank accounts , and paid his bills . Orde had a lot of money in the bank , the large donations he collected himself in private interviews , but he spent very little of it . I controlled the checkbook , but all I craved was his truth . Orde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image , feel every sensation he described . His metaphors ( what we thought were metaphors ) took on a palpable reality that hung in our nostrils , stuck in the back of our throats . Halfway through any sermon I would notice that I was no longer listening to his words but instead experiencing the phenomena he described . " Hello , Chance , " Miles Barber said . He had come up behind me while everyone else drifted after Orde . " Detective Barber . " " Where 's your boss gone ? " the policeman asked . " I do n't know , " I said . " He does n't check in with me every time he splits . " " He go off like that often ? " " You know as well as I do , " I said . " You come up here enough . " " He always go alone ? " Detective Barber asked . " We 're never alone , Officer . " Barber 's hair was thick and black , but his eyes were light gray . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That day it was an iridescent gray-green two-piece suit with a single-button jacket . He looked and sounded as if his entire life were just off the secondhand rack . " I do n't care about your blue light bullshit , kid . I wan na know if your boss disappears with people from this group into the woods . " " You asked me that before , " I said . " I can arrest you anytime I want , kid . " " Yes , you can , Officer . " Barber took me in with his eyes . I had known many policemen . Ever since I was a child they 'd been rousting me . I knew when a cop hated me  --  my big frame , my black skin . But Barber did n't have time for that kind of hatred . He had a job to do , that was all . I would have liked to help him . But I could not . I could n't , because helping him would have condemned the dream . Barber was a cop , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidence to prove it , and sent the wrongdoers to jail . He was n't concerned with the subtleties of truth and necessity . He could n't see above the small laws that he worked for . I wondered , as he interrogated me for the fifth time , if he knew how close he stood to his precious truth . Did he know that three and a half years earlier I had been summoned from my Shattuck Avenue dive by Orde ? A man , I forget his name , who lived two floors below knocked on my door a little after 11:00 P.M. " Phone , " he said . Before I could get the door open he was already going back down the stairs . There was a pay phone on the second floor that we all used to receive calls . I was surprised because no one ever called me . My mother never even knew the number . " Chance ? " " Teacher ? " I asked . I had never seen Orde away from the park except for that first time we met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been a member of the Close Congregation . " Come to me , " he said and then he gave me the address . I was flattered by the call . I did n't ask why or if it could wait till morning . I just told him that it might take a while because I had no car or bike or money for the bus . " Hurry " was his reply . I found myself running down the nighttime streets of Berkeley . Orde lived in a small house about six blocks down from Telegraph . There was no path through the uncut lawn to his door . I could feel the wet blades of grass against the bare sides of my sandaled feet . He opened the door before I reached it . " Come in . " The small entrance area had a doorway on either side . The room to the left was empty and dark except for a single flickering flame that I thought must have been a candle . The room to the right had an electric light burning behind a half-closed door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Orde commanded . He gestured toward the flickering dark . I obeyed him not because I felt I had to . I wanted to please him because when he spoke he seemed to understand all the pain of my life . He never blamed or made empty promises ; he simply explained and left me to make my own choices . We sat on the floor in the dark room on either side of a fat candle . He wore black slacks and a loose collarless shirt that was unbuttoned . The light played shadows on his shallow chest and gaunt face . His blond hair was in shadow , making his bronzed skin seem pale . " You are half of a thing , " he said , speaking softly and with no particular emphasis . But I felt the words wrap tightly around my mind . " The lower half , " he continued . " The tripod , the foundation , the land below the stars . " I wanted to get up and run . Not to escape , but to work off the elation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep before waking , like I was before blue light . I look upon you as you would see a man who used his head to hammer nails . Poor fool . " The image was so clear in my mind , I worried that it might be a flashback to an old acid trip . " Do you understand ? " Orde asked . " I think so . " " What ? " " The blue light is God , " I said . " No . I do n't think so , " Orde said with a little wonder in his voice . " No . Not God , but life . Not lies or hopes or dreams . Nothing that is to come later , but right now . Right now . Here . " I had never experienced anything like sitting there receiving his words . The only thing even approaching it was an early memory I had of my mother 's trying to show me the San Bernardino mountain range . I was three or four , and she held me in one arm while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out was " far away " and colors . But as she kept explaining and pointing , I slowly made out the mountains she described . The elation I felt at realizing mountains for the first time was a weak emotion compared with what Orde made me feel there in the darkness . I 'd heard him speak many times before , but it never had that kind of impact . It was as if I were transformed temporarily and for a brief moment I saw through his eyes , shared his expanded awareness . " Do you understand ? " Orde asked again . I nodded . " Can you see what I 'm saying ? " " It 's like the whole world , " I said meaninglessly . " Everything . " " Everything must change , " he said , making sense out of my nonsense . " But in order for that to happen we must multiply . We must grow until every animal and fish , every rock and drop of water is one . Everything must merge . " " Like an explosion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . But it will never be unless we can mate . " " Why ca n't you ? " I asked . " I do n't know . I try , " he said . " But my blood is too strong . It devours the egg . " My eyes had adjusted to the darkness by then . There was a wooden bench behind Orde and a pile of clothes or rags on the floor . He stood up and walked toward the door with the electric light shining behind it . I followed him into the light . It was a small dinette separated from the kitchen by a waist-high wall of shelves . A large table , topped with red linoleum , dominated the room , but it was the small corpse slumped back in one of the chrome chairs that captured my attention . It was Mary Klee , one of the Close Congregation . Head thrown back , dark foam down her chin . One eye was wide-open while the other was mostly closed . She wore jeans and a T-shirt . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table before her . I 'm sure I would have been sick if I was n't still stunned by the power of Orde 's words . " I hoped that if we shared blood , her cells might have been strengthened . " There was no apology in Orde 's voice . " But even just to drink some of it , she died . " He stood for a long time then , pondering , I suppose , the future of his race  --  the generation of blue divinity . I sat down across from Mary , looking into her cockeyed stare . I 'd never seen a corpse before , but then again , I 'd never believed in God before Orde told me that there was something higher than God . The silence continued for half an hour or more . " Can you drive a car ? " he asked finally . I must have nodded . " Put her in the car in the backyard and take her somewhere , " he said . There was a junkyard in Alameda I knew . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the way out I wondered why I obeyed him . " It 's only words , " I said out loud . " Only words , but Mary 's really dead . " But I knew the answer . Those words had transformed me , made me believe in something that I could be a part of . Orde did n't mourn Mary . How could he ? People were , at best , coma victims in his eyes . He had n't murdered her ; he had tried to elevate her life . Detective Barber interrupted my thoughts . " I know you think that he 's your friend , kid , " he said . " But you knew those people too . If you think he cares more about you than them , you 're wrong . MacIlvey was his girlfriend and she 's dead . " " We 're all dead , Officer , " I said . " Some of us just do n't know it yet . " Barber shook his head at me . He was a good guy . At that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget the sad truth of Orde 's prophecies.
