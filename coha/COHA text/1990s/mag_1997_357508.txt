There is an expression in Brazil  --  dar um jeito  --  that , loosely translated , means no problem is unsolvable and no barrier too great to cross . Dr. Randas Jose Vilela Batista adopted this attitude in dealing with the patients in his tiny rural hospital outside Curitiba , in the south of Brazil . Many of them were dying of congestive heart failure , which caused their hearts to weaken and enlarge . Because he lacked the resources necessary for the standard American treatments for the disease  --  drug therapy and heart transplant  --  Batista needed to come up with a different solution . The one he finally adopted appears to be a relatively simple procedure , but it has shaken the world of cardiac surgery and offered new hope to people suffering from congestive heart failure . Batista 's radical concept : Since the diseased heart is too big , why not cut off a slice or two and make it smaller ? <P> Batista 's procedure could not have come at a more propitious time . Each year congestive heart failure is diagnosed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain , they believe these patients ' hearts were impaired either by damage resulting from a heart attack or by a viral infection . When thus weakened , the heart tries to compensate by stretching its muscles to help it beat . But as the heart 's muscular left ventricle expands , it becomes less efficient at pumping blood through the body . Patients in late-stage heart failure pump as little as 15% of the blood that enters the heart back into the body , compared with 65% to 70% for those with a healthy heart . Patients ' symptoms include general feelings of weakness and shortness of breath as a result of the poor circulation . <P> What makes Batista 's procedure so revolutionary and so controversial is the seeming paradox of cutting away heart muscle to make the heart stronger . As Batista boldly excises chunks of the heart ( some pieces are the size of a normal heart ) and sews the heart back together , surgeons around the world are watching with both skepticism and awe . <P> Neither of the standard therapies for congestive heart failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Medications such as ace inhibitors keep the body 's blood pressure down , making it easier for a weakened heart to circulate blood , but they do not fix the organ . In late-stage heart failure , the only option is a heart transplant . But while as many as 50,000 people in the U.S. alone need a heart transplant , only 2,500 transplants are performed there each year . Heart transplants have proved quite effective , with mortality rates of only 20% after a year ( but 20% to 30% of patients die while waiting for a donor ) . For those deemed unsuitable for a donor heart  --  some of the elderly or those with chronic diseases like AIDS or cancer  --  there is little hope .
