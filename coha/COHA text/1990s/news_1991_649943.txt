<p> A pastoral letter on Christian-Jewish relations and anti-Semitism was read today during masses in all Roman Catholic churches in Poland . Signed by the nation 's bishops , including its primate , Josef Cardinal Glemp of Warsaw , the letter reflects the appeal to combat anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe made by Catholic and Jewish representatives at a joint meeting in Prague last September . The letter also follows the emotional controversy about relocating a convent from the Auschwitz concentration camp site . Reminding Polish Catholics of the Jewishness of Jesus and his mother , the bishops recapitulate the Second Vatican Council 's affirmation of Christianity 's debt to the Jewish people and repudiation of the charge that Jews bear responsibility for the death of Christ . The excerpts here , on Polish-Jewish relations and the Holocaust , were translated by Thomas E. Bird of Queens College , City University of New York . <p> With the Jewish people , we Poles have particular ties as early as from the first centuries of our history . Poland became for many Jews a second fatherland . The majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the territories of the previous and current Polish commonwealth . Unfortunately , in our century this particular land became the grave for several million Jews . Not by our wish , and not by our hands . <p> Here is what our Holy Father said recently , on Sept. 26 of this year , about our common history : " There is still one other nation , one particular people : the people of the Patriarchs , of Moses , and the Prophets , the inheritors of the faith of Abraham . . . This people lived side by side with us for generations , on the same land , which became , as it were , a new fatherland of their diaspora . <p> " This people underwent the terrible death of millions of their sons and daughters . At first they were stigmatized in a particular way . Later , they were pushed into the ghetto in separate neighborhoods . Then they were taken to the gas chambers , they underwent death  --  only because they were children of this people . <p> " Murderers did this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One can not dishonor a land by the death of innocent victims . Through such death a land becomes a sacred relic . " <p> Many Poles saved Jews during the last war . Hundreds , if not thousands , paid for this with their own lives and the lives of their loved ones . For each of the Jews saved , there was a whole chain of hearts of people of good will and helping hands . The express testimony of that help to Jews in the years of the Hitler occupation are many trees dedicated to Poles in the place of national memory , Yad Vashem , in Jerusalem , with the honored title , " Just Among the Nations , " given to many Poles . <p> In spite of so many heroic examples of help on the part of Polish Christians , there were also people who remained indifferent to this incomprehensible tragedy . We are especially disheartened by those among the Catholics who , in some way , were the cause of the death of Jews . They will forever gnaw at our conscience on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped and did not stretch out a helping hand to a Jew during the time of danger or caused his death , we must ask for forgiveness of our Jewish brothers and sisters . <p> We are aware that many of our compatriots still remember the injustices and injuries committed by the postwar Communist authorities , in which people of Jewish origin also took part . We must acknowledge , however , that the source of inspiration of their activity was clearly neither their origin nor religion but the Communist ideology , from which the Jews themselves , in fact , suffered many injustices . <p> We express our sincere regret for all the incidents of anti-Semitism which were committed at any time or by any one on Polish soil . We do this with the deep conviction that all incidents of anti-Semitism are contrary to the spirit of the Gospel and  --  as Pope John Paul II emphasized on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the war  --  " remain opposed to the Christian vision of human dignity . " In expressing our sorrow for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forget that we consider untrue and deeply harmful the use by many of the concept of what is called Polish anti-Semitism , as an especially threatening form of that anti-Semitism ; and in addition frequently connecting the concentration camps not with those who were actually involved with them but with Poles in a Poland occupied by the Germans . <p> Speaking of the unprecedented extermination of Jews , one can not forget and even less pass over in silence the fact that the Poles as a nation were one of the first victims of the same criminal racist ideology of Hitler 's Nazism . <p> The same land , which for centuries was the common fatherland of Poles and Jews , of blood spilled together , the sea of horrific suffering and of injuries shared , should not divide us but unite us . For this commonality cries out to us  --  especially the places of execution and , in many cases , common graves . Together we await the Messiah , the Savior , although we , believing that He is Jesus Christ of Nazareth , await not His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty of the manger in Bethlehem but in power and glory . <p> The most important way to overcome the difficulties that still exist today is the establishment of a dialogue which would lead to the elimination of distrust , prejudices and stereotypes , and to mutual acquaintance and understanding based on respect for our separate religious traditions as well as opening the way to cooperation in many fields . It is important , moreover , that while doing this , we learn to experience and appreciate the proper religious contexts of Jews and Christians , as they are lived by Jews and Christians themselves .
