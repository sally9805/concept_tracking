<p> WHEN the 14th Dalai Lama was given the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 , the Chinese  --  who had overrun his country in 1951  --  reacted predictably . They called the award " preposterous . " <p> The United States also ignored the honor , pointing up the reason why the world has been so slow in recognizing the virtual holocaust of a 2,100-year-old civilization that has been happening in the Himalayas for the past four decades : Tibet is a nation with no strategic or military value . <p> But it also is a country of nonviolence and compassion , and gained enough worldwide sympathy to create " The International Year of Tibet "  --  with the exiled Dalai Lama touring North America last year to give cultural lectures , lead peace and meditation workshops and Tibetan monks participating in art exhibits . As part of the year  --  which continues through March  --  the Castro Theater will present for eight days the Best of the Tibet Film Festival , the beginning of a 15-city Tibet film festival tour .

Instead , in order to receive permission to travel , they had to assure Chinese authorities that they were retracing the early 1900s route of the famous French explorer Alexandra David-Neel in the provinces of Amdo and Kham . Once in the country called " the altar of the world , " the French crew discovered that more than 6,000 monasteries  --  repositories of the land 's benign spiritual and cultural heritage  --  systematically had been destroyed . Film makers were allowed to photograph only the reconstruction of a few temples , which , they say , now are used as tourist attractions .

The film makers were forced to develop their negatives in Beijing , where a military committee edited all signs of the Chinese presence  --  such as soldiers positioned behind every dancing group and praying monk . <p> The film is narrated by Hollywood star Richard Gere , a practicing Buddhist who helped found Tibet House in New York , dedicated to promoting the understanding and appreciation of Tibetan culture . <p> Against the scenic grandeur of the country and the gentle images of its dancing , chanting , praying people , Gere 's chilling narrative recounts the political and spiritual disasters suffered since the Chinese occupation . He recounts that more than 1.2 million people  --  one sixth of the population  --  have been killed , and Tibetans have become a minority in their own country through forced abortion , sterilization and resettlement . Wildlife has been wiped out , rivers polluted . Nuclear missile sites cover the plateau . <p> Another American who has become deeply involved in the struggle to save Tibetan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internationally acclaimed film " Lord of the Dance : Destroyer of Illusion " ( January 28 ) , which he shot in Nepal during two months of 1984 . This remarkable work , which came out in 1985 , focuses on the festival of Mani Rimdu , a ritual of compassion and empowerment , which goes back to the ninth century . Kohn shot the ceremony at the Chiwong monastery in a remote area of Nepal near Mount Everest , since Chinese authorities no longer permit it to be held in Tibet . <p> For Buddhists , Kohn said , the cause of all suffering is illusion . " To help people destroy their illusions is the greatest thing you can do for them , " he said . One person designated to do that is an exiled abbot , Trulshig Rinpoche , the 11th incarnation bearing the name " Precious Destroyer of Illusion , " who presides over the ritual . <p> Of all Tibetan art forms , Kohn said , ritual is the most complicated . It is meditation acted out . " It 's a challenge for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The film 's narration was drawn from the text of the ritual . " <p> The Lord of the Dance is a god who embodies the ultimate in compassion , and compassion is the greatest goal of Tibetan religion , Kohn said : " Aspiring to be Lord of the Dance is aspiring to be perfectly compassionate . " Tibetans believe , he said , that human beings can become perfect on this earth . " To achieve this they must practice . Part of the reason for a festival like Mani Rimdu is to give monks the chance to rehearse at being perfect human beings . " <p> The ritual takes several hundred hours . " It has a marathon quality to it . Even the dance in the film took 14 hours to shoot  --  they danced from 6 in the morning until 8 p.m . " Kohn , who studied at Trulshig Rinpoche 's monastery Thubten Choling in northeast Nepal , has seen present-day Tibet . <p> " It 's heartbreaking , " he said , " like visiting Paris during the Nazi occupation . Soldiers everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fear in people 's faces . " <p> Since Tibet was invaded by China , it is only in the out-of-the-way places that the culture is being preserved , he said . " But what is left  --  the fringes , really  --  are only a pale reflection of what was . In the old capital Lhasa there were monasteries with more than 10,000 monks in them . When there was a dance festival it was not with a dozen dancers but 400 . And there were not 1,000 spectators but , 20,000 . " <p> Among those working to preserve the Tibetan culture in exile are a young husband-and-wife film team , Tibetan Tenzing Sonam and Ritu Sarin , who live in London . Their 1991 film , " The Reincarnation of Khensur Rinpoche " ( January 29-30 ) is a tale laden with the country 's spiritual beliefs . <p> The film follows the story of Choenzey Dakpa Samdub , a 47- year-old monk dedicated to searching and finding the reincarnation of his master Khensur Rinpoche , the revered monk who died at Drepung Monastery ( relocated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current abbot receives a letter smuggled out of Tibet concerning a 3-year-old who has displayed an affinity for all things religious , the Dalai Lama divines that the boy is most likely the reincarnation of the dead master . <p> Sonam explained the artistic circumstances that created the film . " In 1988 , we met Choenzey , who is our main character , and found our story . I 'm Tibetan , and I am quite used to reincarnation , it 's part of our culture . Choenzey was a cook at the monastery where we were guests , and he was in the process of looking for his master 's reincarnation at that time . " <p> The film makers thought his search would make a " fantastic film . " <p> " The difficulty is that when we spoke to the Dalai Lama , we asked him when the boy might be found , " Sarin said . " He said it could be two years or 10 . So that meant traditional financing was out . " <p> Three months later , the couple learned that Choenzey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him . <p> " He had gone into Tibet in secrecy , " Sonam said . " The Dalai Lama confirmed the boy was the reincarnation as did the Nechung oracle who was consulted . We had permission to film while the oracle chanted through his medium . But we were sworn to secrecy until the boy was safely out of Tibet . " <p> Actually , they had a remarkably easy time smuggling the boy out , the film makers said . A young Tibetan couple took traders back and forth between Tibet and Nepal , and they pretended the child was their son and took him across the border to Kathmandu . <p> From Kathmandu , Choenzey escorted the little lama to Sarnath , a Buddhist sacred site , near Benares , where the Dali Lama was teaching . " All the monks came out to greet the child , offering the ceremonial white scarf , the symbol of respect , " Sonam said . <p> In the film , the Dalai Lama is seen performing a symbolic ceremony , cutting the last lock of hair from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The spiritual traditions of Tibet continue through yet another generation . <p> Among the other films offering audiences an in-depth look at these traditions are : " Tibetan New Year ( January 28 ) , " Menri Monastery " ( January 28 ) , " Song of Tibet " ( January 29-30 ) .
