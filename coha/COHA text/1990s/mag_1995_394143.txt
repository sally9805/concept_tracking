MEMBERS OF THE GRADUATING CLASS of 1995 , faculty and staff , parents , family and friends . Let me add my own word of warmest congratulation on this happy occasion . You graduates , with the help of your parents and teachers , have successfully completed the course of studies at a prestigious institute of learning . You have survived the homework , the quizzes , the term papers , the book reports and the tests in a program distinguished for its fidelity to the great educational tradition of the Jesuits and their lay colleagues . You all look happy and proud , and you should . You earned it . But excuse me if I inject a note of healthy realism into this joyous day 's proceedings . Remember what Archie Bunker used to say to his wife every evening when he came home from work ? " It 's a jungle out there , Edith ! " Indeed it is . And to survive and prosper in that jungle , you must be very careful about the way you try to profit from your education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the things you have picked up in your four years will be very useful . You have amassed huge amounts of information , facts and skills . You have learned how important it is to feel good about yourself . You have been accepted into some of the better institutions of higher learning , where the process of self-improvement , so happily begun , will go on apace for several more years . With hard work , ingenuity , luck and a little help from your friends , these will some day help you make enough money to buy enough things to insure your self-fulfillment and lasting happiness . On the other hand , some of the other things you may have picked up range from the useless to the dangerous . Some well-meaning teachers have probably tried to infect you with some of their own idealism . In one way or another , they have all tried to develop in you a moral sense that values such qualities as honesty , generosity and even sexual responsibility . Some have attempted to distract you with talk of social consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry for those less fortunate but even obliged to try to help them . You probably still have some of their slogans rattling around in your heads  --  like " men for others , " " for God 's greater glory " and " the following of Christ . " In your religion classes and liturgies and retreats , they have tempted you to look for some larger meaning in life , to dabble in questions of ultimate concern , to question whether there is more to life than earning , spending , accumulating and consuming . There is only one sure way to insulate yourself against all this fuzzy idealism . Remember the goal . Remember why you came to high school in the first place , and why you 're going to college in the next place . What 's the bottom line ? The bottom line : How much do you make a year ? How much do you own ? How good is your credit ? Next year , and the year after , how much more will you be making and how much more will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are what you drive . " Do n't forget the most basic doctrine of our national religion : Happiness can be bought . Money buys products , and products can fulfill us and satisfy our deepest human needs . The religious people tell you that we are created to love persons and use things . But practicality demands that we love things and use people . Do n't let relationships or religion or idealism get in the way as you claw your way to the top . It 's worth it , because in the game of life , the one who dies with the most toys wins . DO N'T GET ME WRONG . I 'm not against religion , so long as you keep it in its proper place . Religious consumerism is all right , but Christian discipleship is not . Let me explain . Discipleship , the following of Christ , implies that in setting your priorities , God 's will and the values of Jesus Christ will play an important part . Thus , in deciding what to do with your life , how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you actually try to find out what God wants and how Jesus would want you to act . This kind of religion is a major distraction . It might make you doubt whether this job is really worth doing , even for big bucks . It could make you wonder how faithful you are in your relationships . It might even damage your self-image by making you feel guilty about such trivial matters as infidelity , greed and superficiality . It could even make you question the whole world view of rugged individualism . This is scary stuff indeed . On the other hand , religious consumerism is O.K. What do I mean by religious consumerism ? Think of the church as a store and your pastor as a storekeeper . On the shelves of this store are such handy items as christenings , weddings , wakes , funerals and safe schools for your children . Drop in when you need one of these services . Otherwise , stay away . IF YOU THINK I 'M EXAGGERATING the pitfalls of Christian discipleship and the dangers of taking religious education too seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardiman graduated from Fairfield University , a Jesuit institution in Connecticut , in 1992 . On that occasion he received the Loyola Medal , the university 's highest honor . Here are some excerpts from his acceptance speech : My life has been ruined . I have come to know what Jesuit education truly is , and a life turned upside down is one of its many implications . I have found that faith and Jesuit education are two-edged swords . I have also learned that faith and the Ignatian tradition serve to afflict the comfortable . They have challenged me to reject the militarism , consumerism and materialism glorified by our society and to attempt to " live simply , that others may simply live . " I have come to value a new definition of success during my time at Fairfield . I am challenged daily to remember that all that I do is done " for the greater glory of God " and that all my actions affect the people of God in a positive or negative manner . In my service to the guests at soup kitchens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here at school , God is at the heart of my every action and interaction . I realize that many people will dismiss my thoughts as naive and something that I will grow out of when I enter the " real world . " But the " real world " can be found where the people of God are suffering , working and praying to make God 's earth a more human place . As you can see , my life is truly ruined according to today 's standards , and I am happy for this . Well . Sad stories like this one are mercifully rare . Fortunately , there are many high school graduates like yourselves who have kept clear heads and gone on to college with their priorities and goals in order . We know this thanks to an annual survey of incoming college freshmen conducted by the American Council on Education and by the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles . Over 200,000 freshmen at 390 institutions are interviewed every year . Among other things , they are asked whether certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two of these goals are developing a meaningful philosophy of life and being financially well off . Over a 20-year period a smaller and smaller number have thought that developing a meaningful philosophy of life is important . On the other hand , each year a larger and larger number identify financial prosperity as a key goal . The head of this research project concluded : " Students tend to see their life being dependent on affluence and are not inclined to be reflective . Our data confirm the decline in interest in existential questions .... Obviously , we are seeing something very profound in our society . Despite Newsweek 's announcement that greed is dead , our data show that it is alive and well . " I ASKED SOME OF MY STUDENTS at Regis High School what they thought about all this . One of them wrote : " There is n't very much to think about the survey . The way the world is now , being well off should be an important thing . A meaningful philosophy of life can not help you in the real world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These students are very clear about what the real world is and is n't . It 's about making money and buying things . It 's not about religion or ideals or integrity . This same survey has shown that , despite widespread publicity about AIDS , there has been a steady increase in college freshman who agree that if two people genuinely like each other , it is fine for them to have sexual relations even if they have known each other only a short time . The real world , to them , has nothing to do with service to others or social responsibility or finding meaning in their work or even wondering what life is all about . It 's certainly not about God or religion or finding their place in the universe . It 's about earning and buying and accumulating and consuming as conspicuously as possible . All the other stuff is unreal . In a junior class at my school , we recently played a Billy Joel song , " Angry Young Man . " The singer says he has outgrown idealism and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has renounced all activism on behalf of justice . He is convinced that taking moral stands has no effect on real life , so he has decided to look out for his own survival . Here are the comments of three of my students :  --  Although I can see what those who protest against injustice are saying , and I sympathize and identify with them as well , as far as practical and sensible considerations go , I think Joel has the upper hand . Results make more concrete sense than abstract feelings .  --  In a serious situation , I would hope that I would act in a principled manner . However , as I get older and have more to lose , I think I will " harden " and start looking to survive as best I can .  --  I think Billy Joel is a lot like me . There are a few people of conscience who care about others , but most people are just out for Number One , and I presume that I will become just like them . For I must get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taught the same things you have , are very selective about what they take seriously . They 're ready to dump the morality , the ideals , the vision communicated by the school . They 're ready to sell themselves at the very first opportunity to get ahead . They are survivors . They have survived Christian education and are ready to make it in the real world . How about you ? Are you ready ? Well , it 's time to wrap this up . At the end of graduation addresses , speakers always tell the graduates to " go forth . " So ... Go forth into the world and join generations of bright young Americans who have survived religious and moral education in church-related institutions and did not let it get in the way of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . Work hard . Accumulate . Exploit . Enjoy . Invest . Buy . Consume . Get rich , be happy and feel good about yourself . Maybe , down the road , you 'll meet one of my former students who wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one basic goal in life : to look good , eat good and smell good . For instance , take the students in this school . Do n't believe the bull they tell you , that they chose to come to this school because " I 'll be better able to execute my role as a Christian , ' or some other pious statement . They chose to come here to get into a good college , which in turn will get them into a high-paying job . " AS FOR THE REST OF YOU , those who want something more out of life than to look good , eat good and smell good , who think you 're called to something higher than conspicuous consumption in a hedonistic , materialistic vacuum  --  the people who founded your school and keep it going are proud of you and wish you well . They even hope you get rich . They agree with the wise man who said " I 've been rich and I 've been poor , and , believe me , rich is better . " But they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more to life than making a living . And to each of you , whether disciples or religious consumers , congratulations on successfully finishing this chapter in your life , and best wishes in the next installments and in all the rest of your story .
