The Body Armor Emporium opened down the street a few months back , and I tell you , it 's killing mom-and-pop bulletproof vest rental shops like ours . We 've tried all the gimmicks : two-for-one rentals , the VIP card , a night drop . But the end is near , and lately we have taken to bringing the VCR with us to the shop , where we sit around watching old movies . <p> Lakeview was supposed to expand our way , but receded toward the interstate , and here we are , in an abandoned strip mall , next to the closed down Double Drive In where Jane and I spent our youth . After K-Mart moved out , most of the stores followed , leaving only us , a Godfather 's Pizza , and a store , I swear , that sells nothing but purified water and ice . It is afternoon , near the time when Ruthie gets out of school , and behind the counter , Jane and I face 40 acres of empty parking spaces while watching Blue Hawaii . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real time killer , and the way Jane sighs when Elvis scoops the orphan kid into the jeep tells me this movie may make her cry . " When 's he going to dive off that cliff ? " I ask . " That 's Fun in Acapulco , " Jane says . " We used to have it on Beta . " She sets down her design pad . " God , remember Beta ? " <p> " Jesus , we were kids , " I say , though I feel it , the failed rightness of Betamax smiling at us from the past . " I loved Betamax , " she says . <p> I only rented one vest yesterday , and doubtful I 'll rent another today , await its safe return . There are n't many customers like Mrs. Espers anymore . She 's a widow and only rents vests to attend a support group that meets near the airport . The airpark 's only a medium on threat potential , but I always send her out armed with my best : 36-layer Kevlar , German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trauma plate that slides into a Velcro pocket over the heart the size of a love letter . The Kevlar will field a .45 hit , but it 's the trauma plate that will knock down a 12-gauge slug and leave it sizzling in your pantcuff . I wear a lighter , 2-panel model , while Jane goes for the Cadillac-a $1400 field vest with over-shoulders and a combat collar . It 's like a day-long bear hug , she says . It feels that safe . She has n't worn a bra in three years . <p> The State Fair is two weeks away , which is usually our busiest season , so Jane 's working on a new designer line we think may turn things around . Everyone 's heard the reports of trouble the State Fair has caused other places : clown killings in Omaha , that Midway shootout in Columbus , 4-H snipers in Fargo . <p> Her custom work started with the training vest she made for Ruthie , our 14 year old . It was my idea , really , but Jane 's the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the bottom ring of Kevlar removed , so it 's like a bulletproof bolero , an extra set of ribs really . The whole lower G. I. track is exposed , but fashion , comfort , anything to get the kids to wear their vests these days . Last week I had Jane line a backpack with Kevlar , which I think will rent because it not only saves important gear , but protects the upper spine in a quick exit . Next , I want to toy with a Kevlar baby carrier , but the problem as I see it will be making a rig that 's stiff enough to support the kid , yet loose enough to move full-speed in . We 'll see . <p> Through the windows , there 's a Volvo crossing the huge lot , and I can tell by the way it ignores the lane markings that it 's not the kind of person who cares about the dangers of tainted water and stray bullets . The car veers toward Godfather 's pizza , almost aiming for the potholes , and Jane sniffles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . " Remember Ruthie at that age ? " I ask . <p> " You bet , " Jane says . <p> " Let 's have another baby . " <p> " Sure , " she answers , but she 's only half listening . She really gets into these movies . <p> After Elvis is over , Jane makes ice teas while I drag two chairs out into the parking lot so we can enjoy some of the coming evening 's cool . We bring the cordless phone , lean back in the chairs and point our feet toward sunset . This time of day brings a certain relief because even in September , a good vest is like an oven . <p> There is a freedom that comes with doom , and lately we use our large lot to play Frisbee in the evening or football in the near-dark , with Ruthie always outrunning one of us for the long bomb . Some nights the Filipinos who own the water store drift out under the awnings to watch us . They wipe their brows with apron ends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Honestly , I 've lost most of my spirit in the fight against the Emporium . When we opened , we were cutting edge , we were thinking franchise . Our customers were middle class , people like us ; they still wanted to believe but understood that , hey , once in a while you needed a little insurance . Their lives were normal , but nobody went out on New Year 's without a vest . To buy a vest ten years ago was to admit defeat , to say what 's out there is n't just knocking at the door-it 's upstairs , using your toothbrush , saying good morning to your wife . <p> As the sun sinks lower , we watch the first pizza delivery boys of the evening zoom off in their compact cars , and it 's a sight that hurts to see . These are high-school kids , most of them too poor to afford or too young to appreciate the value of a vest . I mean , they 're going out there every night as is , which makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to make excuses when they came in to rent a vest-vacationing in Mexico , weekend in the city , reception at a Ramada Inn , flying Delta . Now they 're haggling over expired rent-9-get-1-free coupons . Now they 're going to the Emporium to buy 16-layer Taiwanese knock-offs for 300 bucks . The Emporium is 24-hours , something I 'm philosophically against : you should see the tattoos on some of those guys coming out of there at 3:00 a.m . These days people are making the investment . They 're admitting the world 's a dangerous place . <p> Across the parking lot , we see Ruth peddling toward us . She 's wearing a one-piece red Speedo , her training vest , and the Kevlar backpack . Her hair is still wet from freshmen swim practice . She meanders over , awkward on a Schwinn she is now too big for , and peddling big , easy loops around us , announces that she 's an outcast . " Only dorks wear their vests to school , " she says . " You 're killing my scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , the last light on my feet , being the center of my daughter 's universe for a few minutes . Ruth pedals then coasts , pedals then coasts , the buzz of her wheel bearings filling the gaps in our afternoon , and I almost forget about the Emporium . <p> Later , after Jane leaves to find Ruthie and take her home for the evening , I 'm sitting in the shop when Mrs. Espers comes in . She looks a little down , is holding the vest like it 's made of burlap and I know the feeling : it 's been one of those days for me too . <p> " How was the support group ? " I ask as I fill out her receipt . <p> " I 've crossed the line , " she says . <p> " How 's that ? " <p> " I 'm not afraid of flying anymore . " <p> I 'm not sure what this means in terms of her group , of whether she 'll no longer be needing my services , but you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'm not afraid of anything , " she says with a certain formality . <p> " Wow , good , good . " <p> She pauses at the sight of her held-out receipt and shakes her head no . " I 'm sorry , Bill , but I 've made the decision . " <p> She says this and leaves , and I 'm left thinking she 's decided to go to the Emporium to make the purchase . I figure some flying counselor talked her into the idea of permanent protection , but it is when I go to throw her vest atop the " in " stack , when I remove the titanium trauma plate that I know she will never wear a vest again . The shiny titanium is lead-streaked , and as I rub my thumb in the indention some bullet has made , I can still feel her body heat on it . <p> I float out into the parking lot and watch her red taillights disappear into the night , and know that she 's right , she 's free , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a handicapped parking spot , rubbing the titanium , and I lean against the old shopping cart bin . The faint laughter of distant gunfire comes from the direction of the railyard , and I look at the lighted windows of the few shops left in the mall , but can only see the darkened stores between them . In my hands , the bright titanium reflects the stars my 14-year-old already knows by heart , but I no longer have it in me to look up , to lift my head to the place of our dreams , Jane 's and mine , when we were 18 . <p> I wander the mall , waiting for my wife to return , something which takes longer and longer these days . She gets a little melancholy now and then , needs a little space to herself , and I understand ; these are hard times we 're living in . Leaving the shop wide open , I head for the Godfather 's . But when I get there , I 'm confused because I see my daughter through the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Ruth is leaned up against an ancient Donkey Kong machine , talking to a delivery boy on a backwards chair . She is wearing her training vest with nothing on under , you can tell , and this boy stares at the exposed plane of her stomach . She has her cheek against the side of the video game , chatting about something , while the boy subtly marvels at how the fine hairs around her navel hum pink in the neon beer light , and I am roaring through the door . I walk right up to my daughter and thump her trauma plate to hear the squish of a cigarette pack and the crack of a CD case . Out of the pocket that should cover her heart forever , I pull Aerosmith and menthols . I grab her by the wrist . " Where 's your protection ? " <p> " Jesus , Dad , " she says and starts to dig in the backpack at her feet . <p> The pizza boy looks like he 's about to pipe in , and I wheel on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Dad , nobody wears their vests to school . I 'm a total outcast . " <p> This is my daughter . This is the age she is at . <p> Jane eventually returns , finds me watching Cool Hand Luke in the dark store , and neither of us says anything . She puts her hands on the counter when she comes in , and I ask no questions about where she 's been . I place my hands on hers , stroke the backs of her fingers , and then turn out the lights , closing up shop a little early . <p> Lately we have taken to cruising late at night under the guise of R &; D. We 'll pull the tarp off the ' 72 Monte Carlo her mom left us , the car Jane used to run wild in . It has the optional swivel passenger seat , black leather , that can turn 180 degrees . We grab the foam cooler and Jane swivels the seat all the way around so her feet are on the backseat and her head reclines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wherever she wants to go . We 'll glide by the boarded-up Ice Plant where we once drank on summer nights , feet dangling off the loading ramps . We prowl past by the Roadhouse with our lights off and count the Ninja motorcycles lined up out front . The cemetery these days is fenced and locked and a security guard cruises the old stadium in a golf cart , but we circle nonetheless . <p> Midnight finds us rolling through the waves of the old Double Drive In , the gravel crunching under our tires , the Monte Carlo 's trunk bottoming out like it used to , and all the broken glass , beer caps and bullet casings now sparkle like stars . <p> We park and sit on the warm , ticking car hood and look off at the Emporium across the street . We have his and hers binoculars , 7X40s from her father on our tenth anniversary , and we sit here , side by side in the dark , as we check out their customers . We train our lenses at the bright displays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is that Fred Sayles ? " she asks . " By the baby armor . " <p> I focus in on him fondling the competition 's goods . " That son of a bitch . " <p> " Remember the night he streaked through the second feature ? " <p> " We all turned on our headlights . The Day the Earth Stood Still , right ? " <p> " Plan Nine From Outer Space , " she says . " Remember window speakers ? " <p> " Remembr high-point beer . " <p> " Nash seats . " <p> " Trunkloads . " <p> " Keys left in the ignition . " <p> " Mars Invades . " <p> We both look up . <p> II . <p> It is a moment near the end of things , a point at which , seated in a lawn chair amid the vast emptiness of a K-Mart parking lot , Jane is forced to reflect . Her husband is giving driving lessons to her daughter , who loops circles around Jane in the old Caprice they are now reduced to driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane 's thoughts , which come to focus on the notion that Ruthie 's 16 , and Bill should have taught her this a year ago . <p> The Caprice stops , backs up , parallel parks between a pair of worn yellow lines somehow chosen from the thousands in front of the closed-down discounter . It 's just like Bill , she thinks , to worry about lines when there 's not another car for miles . Jane lifts her hand and the sun disappears . In this brief shade she notices the moon , too , is up there . <p> Check your mirrors , she can hear Bill say , even from here , as he trains her daughter to always , always be on the lookout . But Jane knows Ruthie 's come to be on intimate terms with her blindspot . It 's one of the few things they share these days . <p> Behind her their small rental store is empty . These days , the final ones , he has a VCR running all day in the shop . Over her shoulder she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it feels like it is their whole history looming behind them : the mom-and-pop store , those liberal-arts dreams , their own let 's put on a barn dance notion of being their own bosses , here , in a strip mall . She has the cordless phone with her , but it does n't ring , has not in we do n't talk about how long , and Jane reclines some in the heat , points her feet toward the horizon . <p> Look out , Bill yells , you just hit a Volvo , and slaps the dash for effect , leaving Ruthie momentarily breathless : she swivels her head to see the chrome and glass she must have missed , but there is only 40 acres of empty parking . <p> The sun swoops low , Ruthie pedals off to junior-varsity swim practice , and no , Jane says , not The Treasure of Sierra Madre again . On the counter before them are two dozen bulletproof vests frayed to the point that they would n't stop slingshots and 60 or 70 videos Bill got cheap when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we are , Jane thinks , between a chapter-11 pizza joint and a store that has made the switch from water to spirits . This is the place we are at , around the corner from the drive-in theater where she and Bill spent their youth , a place she wo n't even look at because these days , even worse than hope , nostalgia is her enemy . <p> Bill shrugs his shoulders , lights a menthol , and pops in Viva Las Vegas , as if Elvis can soothe her anymore , as if Elvis was n't 187,000 miles away . <p> Jane begins to toy with the register , hitting no sale , no sale , a sound she knows can wound him . But Bill 's busy doing " R Sr D , " as he calls it . First he thought bulletproof teen wear would save the business , and he made Ruthie wear a " training " vest to school for two years to drum up business . Now she wo n't take the vest off for her life . <p> His ongoing obsession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 times , and if there 's anything that offends Jane more than the grandeur of his optimism , it 's the notion of wanting to make infants bulletproof , of fusing the two ideas into the same breath . The whole idea is fatally flawed , she knows as she teases the few remaining twenties in the register . It 's not what 's out there you need to look out for , but what 's closer , what 's making your cereal crackle , what 's tinkering in the garage , or crashing all around like unseen cars . <p> Bill tuggs the straps of his Kevlar carrier , trying to simulate every force that could come between a mother and child . Then he begins stuffing the carrier with video tapes-Clint Eastwood , Annette Funicello , Benji-until , he seems to decide , the carrier takes on the mass and weight of a small person , and he is off on tonight 's R &; D , running laps around the abandoned drive-in to gauge the carrier 's give and take , its ability to cradle a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jane unfastens the chest-crushing vest , and it smolders off her with all that body heat . She pinches the sticky shirt from her side , runs her hand underneath , over creases in the skin she knows are red . She wakes up some nights , thinking the oven has been left on . She can feel the coils glowing downstairs , but she wo n't go check , she wo n't give it that . Now she pulls the twenties , tens and fives from the till , for safety 's sake , she thinks , so she can feel the lightweight cash in her pocket . <p> Wandering , she strolls along the grit-worn sidewalk , stares at stars through holes in the K-Mart awning . This way it all looks black up there , the occasional star the rarity . There are bullet holes in the masonry between her and the old Godfather 's , and she stops to twist her pinkie in the lead-traced pocks . Mr. Ortiz , the Filipino who owns the liquor store , has started keeping a gun in his register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there 's a weight in the cash drawer that nearly pulls the register off the counter when he makes a sale . <p> There was a day when she was scared of guns , when the vest store seemed like the right idea , a public service even . Jesus , they had really said that to each other . Though she has never touched a gun , she 's confident now she could heft one pretty handily , squeeze off a few rounds , rest it warm against her cheek and smell the breech . <p> Where the masonry meets glass , she thinks she gets a glimpse of him reflected out there , an aberration in the dark lot . Behind her , she 's sure it 's his arms glinting , racing nearly invisible in a sheen of black Kevlar . But she does not turn to be sure . <p> At the pizza joint , she sees through the window her daughter stretched across the empty bartop , drafting two beers into Styrofoam cups . Ruthie 's hair is still wet from j-v swim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now she 's got her trauma plate pulled out and is using it as a lipstick mirror , drinking between applications . This is something Jane has never before seen , Ruthie so loose with her trauma plate , and this makes Jane stop outside and stare . <p> There is a boy , one of those big Ortiz kids it looks like , and he and Ruthie are drinking hard and fast together . Jane looks at them for some time through the soap paint on the window , an interstellar pizza scene . Ruthie laughs , they drink , something is said to her , and she punches him hard . He thumps her back , there , in the chest , and then she 's holding him again , cupping his chin in the open throat of her palms , the Vulcan oven glowing behind them . She holds him , they dance three slow steps , he spins her . They drink , they laugh , they box each other 's ears , they drink again , laughing ' til fine mists of beer shoot pink from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a careless spirit Jane has forgotten . As she sees them whisper , she remembers a time before Bill , and tries to read her daughter 's lips . Ruthie rubs her forehead against the jut of this boy 's cheekbone , whispering , and Jane almost thinks she can make it out-let 's make a break for Texas , her daughter might be saying , and I want my Monte Carlo back , Jane thinks . She imagines a car she will never see again , enters it under maroon T-tops , feels the rocking slosh of dual fuel tanks , smells the leather , hears the spark plugs crackle to life , and swivels in custom seats to see it all disappear behind her . <p> Later , after she has dropped Ruthie off at home , Jane steers the Caprice the long way back to the shop , where she will wait out the last hour with Bill before closing . He will want to make love tonight , she knows-Westerns always do that to him , especially The Treasure of Sierra Madre-and that 's okay with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She slowly eases past the Body Armor Emporium , and just getting caught in its gallery lights is enough to draw her in . She 's been here before , enough times it would kill Bill to know . Inside , the lights are of the brightest variety , the walls white , expansive , always that smell like aspirin coming off the rows and rows of black nylon vests . Jane could care less about every vest in the world , but she runs her fingers down whole groves of them because unlike her husband , she feels safe in the arms of the enemy . <p> There is a tall man , older , with close-cropped grey hair and no-fooling shoulders he seems almost embarrassed of-a by-product of the joy of exertion-and he beckons her into the fitting mirrors where she sees herself in satellite view , from three different angles . For a moment , there are no blindspots and she is at ease . This man takes her measurements quietly , as he has done many times beforehumming and storing numbers in his head-the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings of her pelvis and cliffdives down to her pantcuffs . He is calm , confident , placing his hand warm on her sternum to demonstrate where the trauma plate will be . She closes her eyes , remembering a time when she still believed , feels his fingers measuring over , under the cups of her breasts-Jane inhaling-for the purchase she will never make . <p> III . <p> Let 's say you 're 17 . Your mom checked out a while ago . Some nights she just disappears , the Caprice peeling out in front of the family rental store , and maybe you 'll see her near morning , standing out there in the parking lot , buzzed , taking pot shots at the giant drive-in screens two miles away . <p> Your old man 's a little wacked-out too . Let 's say you 're crashed out with Hector , both of you sleeping in the Home Improvement section of K-Mart , his hand over the nylon vest he again tried to remove tonight , and even though you quit the team , you 're dreaming you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Halverson is yelling in the dream but you can go no faster . Hector is swimming under you , upside-down , telling you use your back , your chest , put your shoulders into it , but it is useless because these are the parts of you that are always , always off limits . <p> So you 're sleeping , 3:00 a.m. say , when your dad rents a vest to some punk who uses it to rob the Filipino drug store two doors down , and after , Mr. Ortiz , Hector 's dad , stands waving his Colt .45 and saying he 's going to put a hole in your old man big as a mantel clock . And there is your father , facing him in a vast black parking lot , wearing an Israeli alz-hesjhad 48-layer combat field vest and he 's shouting come on , come on and get some . You watch this scene with Hector from the bankrupt pizza place , both of you curious if his dad will shoot your dad , and Hector tells you he 's heard there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its way toward Kevlar . Like a cross between Tanqueray gin and burning hair , he says , a green-black gum . You remember that Canis Major was wheeling overhead that night . <p> Let 's say that Pluto 's gone , that the little planet swings wide one day and never comes back . Your varsity swim coach is also your Advanced Placement Astronomy teacher , and in AP Astronomy , the boys never stop because yours are the only breasts that are a mystery to them . It 's a game they play , rapping on your titanium trauma plate when they pass in the hall , though you know the spirit of their fingers goes deeper , and you learn to put your arms up in anticipation . In class , the sun and earth are two white dots , while Pluto 's historical orbit , as Mr. Halverson calls it , races away with his running chalkline across four blackboards . Sometimes he lectures directly to the Kevlar outline of your chest . These boys have never seen Pluto , have never reached for it across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , as if they can feel its loss , just out of reach , as Mr. Halverson 's orbit line comes to a halt at the end of the black slate . <p> There 's nothing out there but starlight and locomotion , Halverson tells you at night swim practice . You think about this for 5,000 yards , back-stroking through the blue lanes , the steam rising off your arms to the batter-black sky . <p> And this is what you come home wet to , the place where you grew up : a hole in the wall behind a dumpster that opens into the dust-flashing cavern of a closed-down K-Mart . Here is where you learn to drive at 13 , racing rusty carts full hilt through Automotive . Among the smashed racks of Entertainment is where Hector always waits for you . You first kiss in the room above , with mirrors that are really windows , lookouts over a discount wasteland . Through the ductwork , you can hear the non-stop static of your old man 's stupid movies . You hear him joking through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you when you fly on an airplane , he says to a rare customer , it 's safer , because the odds of there being two bombs on board are astronomical . <p> You 've slept with seven boys in here , making love , they call it , for your sake , but you know better . Through the hole , into the dark K-Mart , they come , and you are waiting for them . But none ever fingers your ribs , strokes your shoulders , handles that hollow under your heart because every time one starts to tug on those Velcro straps you are in terror . That is your event horizon , Mr. Halverson calls it at swim practice , the speed beyond which you can no longer safely swim without changing your form , the point at which you must let yourself be taken by your own current . Safety is your enemy , he likes to say , and you know he 's right . In your own K-Mart you 're safe , vested , with 36 layers of Kevlar to help you take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Speedo , wet , leaning over the starting block , dripping on the springboard , it 's like being naked under floodlights , unshouldered and alone . That 's what made you break the school record in the 400 Individual Medley last month-the arm-throwing terror of being vestless before the shouts of those who want the most from you . You took your little trophy-a golden girl , hands up , chest out-and quit the team . <p> Karen Coles , whose locker is above yours , is seeing Mr. Halverson . Everybody knows since she crashed his Volvo last week . But only you 've seen the notes that have floated through the cracks into your locker , only you know that she veered on purpose , that she was testing what was between them when she crossed the centerline , that she was saying I love you even as the airbags blew in their faces . <p> Your father is different since Mr. Ortiz fired those warning shots in the parking lot that night . He tries to be even more happy-go-lucky , but there is a nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one on the lookout now . He has bought a gun , a little silver number , your mom calls it , and she stores it under her end of the counter . You remember the excuse he gave , leaning down to you at 14 : it 's for that one bullet , that one well-intended bullet , and after that the odds say you 're good . This is the line that made you cinch your Velcro straps and wonder if you 'd hear the bullet coming . But now you wonder if deep-down , your old man is n't disappointed Mr. Ortiz did n't shoot for the heart . At home , you turn the oven on before climbing into bed . <p> It is the last of the warm days , the end of the semester nearing , one more ' till you graduate , and Mr. Halverson has saved the best for last : black holes . For now , the black and the hole do not seem to concern him . It is a thing called the event horizon he describes , the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know this is going to be his big metaphor for life , his contribution toward bettering your future , a lecture , you can tell , he has made before . He draws a big , easy circle on the board and asks everyone to reflect a moment on the point of no return . But you know it is a mistake to call it that because nothing ever returns , really . Orbits are only historical . You like the swim-team explanation better : call it a line beyond which you can expect only a change in form and high rates of speed , a point of sudden inevitability . You lean back in your desk , you foot looping big , easily drawing his attention , and with a rift in his breathing , he returns his lecture to an institutional mode , comparing the point of no return to drugs and drop-outs , to the joys of college learning and beyond . And we all know what happens in the black hole , he concludes , but his heart is no longer in it . You know those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night , you sweat . You dream in shades of pink and green of gin and burning hair . In the morning , you , your mom , your dad , all eat breakfast in boxer shorts and bulletproof vests . Dad has a VCR set up on the table and watches Clambake ! while your mom stares at her cereal . <p> You had been thinking about it this way : there 's a ring around the thing that draws you near-the palms of Hector 's hands , say , or your reflection in Halverson 's glasses-and to cross that line is to be taken , swept , changed . But today you see it different . Today , standing in the empty AP classroom , not wanting to believe the rumors that Halverson 's fired , packed up in his rental car and gone , you wonder where is your event horizon , where is the line beyond which something will forever be drawn to you . His handwriting is still on the blackboard . Binary star homework due Tuesday , is all it says , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stupidly waiting under the Styrofoam-coat hanger model of the solar system you reach up and set it in motion . But the hand-colored planets swing too smoothly it seems to you , too safely Halverson would say , and plucking Pluto from the mix sets the model wildly spinning . <p> So it 's not just anybody waiting for you in the K-Mart after school , not just some boy grabbing you by the vest straps and pulling you to him , but Hector . It 's Hector 's drugstore heart thumping next to yours , Hector 's letterman chest against yours , Hector 's diveteam hips gaining on yours and you want to believe , you want . <p> Hector has his father 's gun , you your mother 's , and you will ask the boy you love to break the plate guarding your heart . Hector has a Monte Carlo and you 've seen the movie Bullitt enough times in your dad 's shop that there 's a California roadmap in your head as clear as the grooves around Steve McQueen 's eyes , deep as the veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The line must be crossed . He 's ten feet from you , a parking space away . You hand him your mother 's silver little number . It will knock you down , you know , there will be that smell , but soon there will be no more vests , no more fears , only Hector 's fingers on the bruise he 's made , on your sternum , and the line will be crossed , the event set in motion , at the highest of speeds . <p>
