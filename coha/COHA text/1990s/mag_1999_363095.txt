No cultural phenomenon has been more studied and worried over than the effect of television on children . Parents wring their hands over content . Media watchdogs make careers launching competing studies . But while the grownups present position papers , guess what the kids are doing ? They 're alone in their bedroom , watching television . According to a major study measuring the media consumption of 3,000 kids , ages two to 18 , released last week by the Kaiser Family Foundation , the typical American kid spends about 5 1/2 hours a day " consuming " media ( computers and music , but mainly TV ) at home . For kids eight and older , the time jumps to almost seven hours a day . <P> In the interest of disclosure , let me say that I love television . I grew up watching it , even spent several years working for a network . I continue to be a zealous consumer . Some people can deconstruct the tiniest movement of the stock market ; I can tell you what happened last night on Buffy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio is a hefty 3:2 . I have the same respect for television that an avid deer hunter has for guns  --  in order to appreciate the pull of the medium , I think you first have to understand its firepower . But when a typical adolescent is putting in the equivalent of almost a full day at the office in front of the tube , I say we 're into serious overkill . <P> For me , the largest concern is where they are watching television . Two-thirds of all kids eight and older have a television in their bedroom , says the Kaiser report . And a third of kids ages two to seven have TVs in their room . That 's way too many kids spending way too much time alone in their bedroom with only Kermit the Frog and the offspring of Aaron Spelling to keep them company . So the first thing parents should do is take the TV out of a kid 's room . Like computers , televisions should be where parents can at least tell if they are being used . Even those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( half the parents surveyed had no rules about TV ) should at least know if the set is on . The data from this study show that television viewing is becoming an increasingly private , isolating activity , with homes having on average three TVs . Because of this , parents should develop some basic guidelines for family media use . <P> Here are mine : the television should not be on during mealtime or while a child is doing homework . Kids should ask an adult for permission before turning it on . Parents should convey to their children that watching television is a planned activity . A friend of mine goes through the TV listings with his three sons to discuss what they 'd like to watch , and I think that 's a great idea . The TV should be turned off when a particular show is over . Parents should also make an effort to become familiar with the shows that their kids watch . Television can provoke useful conversations within families , much as I remember having with my parents when we watched All in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in only one direction . Kids should be encouraged to watch some of the shows their parents regularly watch , whether it 's 60 Minutes , The Antiques Road Show or Gilligan 's Island . They may tell you they 're lame , but who knows ? Your kid might be impressed that you know all the original plots to the shows on Nick at Nite . The point is , you  --  not the television  --  get to be the parent .
