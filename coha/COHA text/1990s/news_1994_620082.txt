<p> SOME QUESTIONS ON INVADING HAITI <p> Editor  --  American troops may soon be invading Haiti , on a righteous mission that risks turning into a nasty , complex , unpredictable , protracted mess . A few questions before the soldiers land : <p> * Is it sensible to take this course when our vital national interests are not at stake , and when 73 percent of Americans questioned in the latest ( September 8-11 ) poll do not believe the U.S. should lead such an invasion ? <p> * Is President Clinton wise to seek approval for his plan from the United Nations while refusing to do the same from Congress ? <p> * Is one factor motivating the president the belief that he must follow through on earlier threats to remove the Haitian junta since anything less would further deplete his dwindling store of credibility ? If so , is committing American troops to a dubious foreign venture the appropriate way for a president to compensate for inconsistent leadership in other policy arenas ? <p> * What is our plan if President Aristide is restored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to protect Aristide from assassination by guarding him with non-Haitians ? If so , would he not appear to his own people as a puppet of the invading forces ? <p> * If Aristide does survive as president , what will be his relationship with the foreign troops who restored him to office ? If he expects them to follow his orders , are they obliged to obey even if they question the wisdom or necessity of his commands ? If foreign troops take orders from their own countries or the U.N. , would n't this arrangement visibly undermine Aristide 's efforts to take control in his own country ? Might not a successful operation , in short , place the invasion forces in a classic no-win situation ? <p> If President Clinton speaks to the American public before proceeding with this so-called " police action , " he would do well to address questions such as these . This would show that he has thought about a few of the problems that might arise in the days following our memorable victory at the Battle of Port-au-Prince . <p> DAVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> . <p> ' NO MORE BODY BAGS ' <p> Editor  --  Please convey the message to Mr. Clinton and Mr. Christopher , no more body bags are wanted . No to Haiti invasion plans . <p> MICHAEL W. ANDRE <p> Grass Valley ( Nevada County ) <p> . <p> GOP HYPOCRISY <p> Editor  --  A note on irony and Republican hypocrisy  --  <p> The purple oratory then-President Bush used to drum up zeal for the Persian Gulf war stressed our moral obligation to oust a ruthless aggressor from Kuwait and return it to its rightful , albeit unelected , despotic ruler . <p> No oil in Haiti  --  merely a democratically-elected president also ousted by a usurping force . <p> No longer a " vital interest " ? <p> FRANCES WHITNEY <p> Oakland <p> . <p> EXTINCT NOW , EXTINCT LATER <p> Editor  --  The letter from Robert A. Sturgeon ( Chronicle , September 3 ) and other recent letters arguing that it does n't really matter if we cause the extinction of endangered species  --  since all species will become extinct someday anyway  --  reminds me of a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why everyone always makes such a big deal about the Holocaust . After all , most of those exterminated would be dead by now anyway . <p> JAKE WIDMAN <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> OTHER PERSPECTIVES <p> Editor  --  In Gary Waltrip 's letter ( Chronicle , September 9 ) he implies that children would be better off if they were taught more morals and values in school . That is probably true . However , he also implies that the correct way to do this is from a Christian perspective . Would he still want more morals and values taught if they were from , say , a Muslim , Jewish , or Buddhist , etc. , perspective ? It seems that he only wants morals and values taught if they are the ones that Christians advocate . <p> SIMON FRAZIER <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> WILSON 'S SPECIOUS VETO <p> Editor  --  Earlier this week , Governor Wilson vetoed legislation that would have provided domestic partners a few of the privileges mechanically awarded to church/ state-sanctioned hetero-couplings . In doing so , he offered the crowd- pleasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the institution of marriage . " <p> What a specious , nonlinear justification . Of course , the governor 's action wo n't bolster the institution of marriage one bit ; people will continue to marry and divorce to their heart 's content . <p> Except gay and lesbian people . Without addressing himself to this constituency , and without ever mentioning the words " gay or lesbian " in his veto message , he fails to lift his pen and sign a bill that would give these Californians a smattering of the rights others enjoy . <p> BRUCE HINTON <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> COASTAL CLEANUP <p> Editor  --  As daily reports of crime and conflicts consume the headlines , it is easy to become cynical and wonder if there is anything one can do to make a difference . Public service deeds do n't make the headlines as easily as scandals , so it often appears that there are quite a few crooks and selfish con artists and only a handful of people dedicated to a cause greater than themselves . In fact , there are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working toward the good of the environment and others . <p> Every year , the Center for Marine Conservation sponsors an International Coastal Cleanup where thousands of unpaid volunteers rid the beaches of unsightly debris that fouls our beaches and threatens marine life . In California , the event is co-sponsored by the California Coastal Commission . On a single day last year , over 50,000 Californians showed up , cleaned 480 miles of beaches , and collected 512,537 pounds of debris . <p> On September 17 , thousands of your neighbors will forget about the negative headlines and make some good news of their own on our beaches . We urge you to join us , come out and see for yourselves , and leave with the satisfaction of knowing just how many people are willing to work together for a larger , common cause . If you want to help , call 1-800-CMC-BEACH . <p> WARNER CHABOT <p> Center for Marine Conservation <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> A NEW HUMANISM <p> Editor  --  Debra Saunders ' columns are usually refreshing , displaying a certain angry edge in analyzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Independent Policy Forum luncheon seminar with Charles Murray , her anger was misdirected . <p> In contrast to the claims in her column , Murray has been unequivocally clear in his contempt for the destruction  --  economically , socially and intellectually  --  of the disadvantaged . As opposed to the blather of those who apologize for the status quo or some new bureaucratic nightmare for the poor , Murray is seeking to carve out a new humanism for communities  --  a humanism based on real empowerment . There are many things we can do now to overcome the enormous problems facing the underclass , but government edicts and pork are not some of them . <p> Collectivist means to achieve social ends have proven both disastrous to the downtrodden ; and , moreover , the politics of bureaucracy is the major technique for suppressing those desperately in need of social and economic progress . Murray 's call for deregulating the city is hardly a gimmick . Ms. Saunders , for instance , should be well aware of the thousands and thousands of bureaucratic absurdities destroying city life in San Francisco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation , to " public works " inanities , to the downward spiraling " tragedy of the commons . " <p> In the future , I hope that her column and your editorial page will not exhibit such misguided leaps . <p> DAVID J. THEROUX , president <p> The Independent Institute <p> Oakland <p> . <p> WHAT GUINEA PIGS ? <p> Editor  --  Daniel Chaffin 's letter ( " Californians Used as Guinea Pigs , " September 5 ) , did not deserve the space , because the writer was wrong . The Orion program never reached the testing stage . The test of a nuclear rocket motor , not covered by any test ban treaty , went as planned . Releases were lower than predicted , and exposures , if any , were known to be less than the difference between a Los Angeles resident staying home for a day or going to the beach , something they choose without worrying about background radiation from sunshine . No one used Californians as guinea pigs . <p> A. DAVID ROSSIN <p> Los Altos Hills <p> . <p> JOE VS .
