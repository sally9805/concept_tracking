<p> When Hong Kong and Malaysia placed curbs on their stock markets last week , the outcry from foreign investors was immediate and indignant . The governments were committing heresy , these critics said , by turning their backs on the free market in the search for a quick economic fix . <p> But Hong Kong and Malaysia are not playing to an international audience . They are struggling to ease the pain of a punishing economic downturn on their people . In these straitened times , when people are more worried about getting by than going global , building walls around some Asian markets has become an increasingly attractive way of holding the economic typhoon at bay . <p> As emerging markets from Brazil to Russia tumble into crisis , Asia 's isolationist tendencies are alarming senior American officials and could set a profoundly dangerous precedent for the global economy . <p> " We could have an unraveling of the global capital markets if the countries that opt out do better than the countries that stick to the orthodoxy , " said Paul Krugman , a professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most major Asian countries still operate reliably open markets . But as the regional financial crisis sinks into a prolonged recession , it has shaken the faith of many here in the free-market system . <p> " It 's no longer writing on the wall , " said Sir Donald Tsang , the financial secretary of Hong Kong , who sought to curtail certain types of stock trading and ordered a big government intervention in the stock market late last month . " People have begun to close up . Look at our Malaysian friends . " <p> On Sept. 2 , Malaysia discontinued trading in its currency , the ringgit , and imposed sweeping capital controls on its markets . Among the provisions : currency held outside Malaysia will become worthless in a month ; foreign investors can not withdraw their capital for a year . Some analysts said Malaysia had effectively checked itself out of the global economy . <p> Hong Kong 's approach was quite different . Rather than close off its markets , it plunged into them with a ferocity that left investors slack-jawed . Between Aug. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $15 billion to buy shares in an effort to prop the stock market . It also passed new regulations that restrict the short-selling of stocks and rein in the free-wheeling futures market . <p> Unlike Malaysia , Hong Kong 's currency is still fully convertible , and there are no restraints on moving capital in or out of the territory . <p> Still , Malaysia and Hong Kong have a common complaint : the global market  --  with its sharp-eyed speculators and will-o ' - the- wisp capital flows  --  is causing too much pain . With their stock markets crashing , unemployment soaring and currencies under attack , these governments feel they can no longer give foreign investors carte blanche in their markets . <p> " We 're seeing a general loss of patience with trying to satisfy the international marketplace , " Mr. Krugman said . " International investors demand a lot , and it 's starting to look like these countries ca n't do it while rebuilding their economies . " <p> The appeal of capital controls is that they enable governments to pursue economic policies  --  such as lowering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . Malaysia slashed rates after its intervention , giving an immediate lift to its stock exchange . If it had tried that when the ringgit was convertible , it almost certainly would have led to a further devaluation . <p> With Indonesia , Thailand , and South Korea suffering from similar ills , such a strategy might be appealing to their Governments as well . One significant complication is that these countries are receiving loans from the International Monetary Fund , which favors open markets . But Mr. Krugman noted that Russia was getting I.M.F . loans , even though it had suspended trading of the ruble . <p> Mr. Krugman has been both an observer and a player in the recent debate over free markets in Asia . In an article in the last issue of Fortune magazine , he proposed capital controls as a way for Asian countries to gain breathing space in order to repair their economies . <p> Scarcely a week after Mr. Krugman 's article appeared , Malaysia 's Prime Minister , Mahathir bin Mohamad , announced his country 's new restraints . Mr. Krugman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Mahathir said the Fortune article lent a veneer of academic respectability to the move . <p> " The whole thrust is that in extreme circumstances , government intervention is kosher , " said Noordin Sopiee , chairman of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies , a research organization in Kuala Lumpur , which helped draft Malaysia 's new regulations . <p> Meddling in the markets is nothing new in Asia , or in much of the rest of the world , for that matter . Japan and South Korea have both intervened in their stock markets , while Taiwan imposes a modest form of capital controls . China maintains capital controls and a nonconvertible currency . But as Asia 's growth exploded in the 1980 's , most of the countries in the region adopted at least the semblance of a free market . <p> And why not ? In 1996 , Thailand , Indonesia , Malaysia and the Philippines enjoyed a net capital inflow of $96 billion from foreign investors . Outposts like Hong Kong and Singapore became gleaming financial centers by promoting their hands-off governments and open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prevailing ideology is that you must not touch market forces . " <p> American officials are rushing to reassert the free-market standard around the world . Lawrence H. Summers , the Deputy Treasury Secretary , said in a speech in Washington on Wednesday : " It would be a catastrophe if countries were to develop the idea that somehow withdrawing from the global system was right , and that building the right foundation for a market economy was wrong . " <p> Malaysia has come under withering criticism from foreign investors , who say that its controls will scare off investment , retard economic reform and end up hurting the very people they were supposed to protect . <p> " Capital controls are like heroin , " said Mac Overton , a fund manager at MBF Unit Trust in Hong Kong . " Once you get addicted , it 's hard to get off . " <p> Mr. Overton was equally critical of the Hong Kong government , which he said had artificially inflated the stock market by buying so many shares . Moreover , he said the government had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hong Kong an uncertain affair . <p> " How do I know they 're not going to change the rules again ? " said Mr. Overton , who said he had sold all his Hong Kong investments . <p> The economist Milton Friedman , who is a self-described fan of Hong Kong , said the government 's intervention was a " crazy idea . " <p> " Hong Kong has essentially undermined its reputation as a financial center , " Mr. Friedman said in a telephone interview from his home in Northern California . " It can not remain a financial center if it manipulates its stock market . " <p> Sir Donald acknowledged that Hong Kong 's intervention had alienated some of its staunchest supporters . But he said the government had little choice but to act because the former British colony was under attack by a cabal of foreign hedge funds . In what he called a " double play , " Sir Donald said the hedge funds speculated , in succession , against the Hong Kong dollar and the stock market . <p> Since the Hong Kong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed exchange rate , the brunt of the attacks was absorbed by the stock market , which dropped 16 percent in the first two weeks of August . <p> " The attack was sustained and professional , and we believed that if we did not do anything about it , the consequences would be calamitous , " said Sir Donald , who will meet with investors in the United States and Europe later this month to reassure them of Hong Kong 's commitment to an open market . <p> Hong Kong 's buying spree lifted the stock market out of the doldrums , though it surrendered much of its gains this week . The benchmark Hang Seng index declined 3.5 percent today to close at 7,578.48 . <p> The long-term consequences of the campaign are potentially thorny , however . Hong Kong spent $15 billion of its $96 billion in foreign reserves to buy stocks . And it is now the largest shareholder in several of the territory 's leading companies , including the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation . It is unclear how the government can sell off these holdings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government has been widely supported by the people of Hong Kong . A recent survey commissioned by The South China Morning Post showed that economic confidence was rising and approval ratings rose sharply after the intervention . <p> " The government can not let it get worse and worse , " said Shee Leng Leng , a 29-year-old homemaker . " How do you define a free market ? Nobody will regard Hong Kong as a free market if it becomes too bad . " <p> In Malaysia , officials said capital controls would give the Government the chance to repair the economy . They said such repairs would be impossible if Malaysia continued to be buffeted by sudden outflows of capital or speculative attacks on its currency . <p> " Our belief is that the international currency trading system has gone stark raving crazy , " Mr. Noordin said . " Making a rapid rush for a tranquil harbor was a wise course . There seemed to be no alternative . " <p> But outsiders are skeptical that Malaysia will reform its debt-laden banking system or tackle endemic corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahathir 's capital controls are a logical extension of his past practice of blaming foreign currency speculators for the economic collapse . Officials point to a rise in the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange as evidence that Mr. Mahathir 's policies are striking a chord with the public . <p> Appeals to nationalism are not limited to Malaysia . In Hong Kong , which prides itself as the multicultural hub of Asia , the debate over government intervention has taken on a distinct us-versus-them tone , with officials and legislators repeatedly drawing a line between local " investors " and foreign " speculators . " <p> For his part , Sir Donald sought to dispel any notion that Hong Kong was blaming outsiders for its economic ailments . " We love foreign investors here , " he said emphatically . " It 's a bit unfair to tar my name with some other foreign leaders who might have different notions .
