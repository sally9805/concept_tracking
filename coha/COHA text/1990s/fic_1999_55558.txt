IF I WERE TO SEE THINGS in a fateful manner , more than likely I would have gotten a job with the telephone company straight out of high school . I'd'ye been one of those pole guys wearing a silver hard hat . If not that , maybe I'd'ye become one of those motorcycle daredevils who circled a stadium until getting enough speed , then jumped fifty parked junkers . I could 've gotten a job selling new cars , probably , or ended up asking students if they wanted pizza or a cheeseburger in the high-school cafeteria . It seems like I could 've turned out to be one of those lawyers fighting the tobacco industry . If I believed that everything happens for a reason , then these were my only choices . <p> I always thought my story began at age fourteen , when the woman who served mashed potatoes daily in my junior high lunchroom hit me from behind at sixty miles an hour . I was on a Schwinn ten-speed going up Powerhouse Road in first gear . She drove a big light-blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down for a second in order to push in her cigarette lighter . I do n't remember any of this , of course . Someone estimated that I flew thirty feet before a telephone pole stopped my flight ten feet up , that I hit the thing upside down and backwards and slid down slowly and landed on my neck and shoulders , feet in the air , knocked out . <p> Twenty-five years later I 'm able to understand that this was my rebirth  --  that sliding down that telephone pole headfirst was similar to sliding down the birth canal , etcetera . Whenever any of these goddamn stupid Pentecostals and Baptists asks me if I 've been borned again , I can say Uh-huh and not think anything about it . I can take a lie detector test and pass that question . <p> If I believed in fate and whatnot , maybe I should 've started training immediately for the Tour de France or something , but that would 've been nearly impossible . First off , I hurt my hip and limped for the rest of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concussion was lasting , and for a few years I kind of forgot where I was , or why I went , or where I meant to go . If I 'd 've begun a training regimen , more likely than not my father would 've had to come pick me up a hundred miles from home once I realized I 'd forgotten to drop bread crumbs along the way . <p> The bottom line is this : instead of understanding that nearly dying at fourteen should 've given me some direction in life , it only pissed me off . It kind of got me frost-hardened , like a good pepper plant in late March when freak weather tests it . As soon as I woke up three days later in the hospital ( where my father visited almost hourly ) , I crawled over the hospital-bed guardrails and thought only one thing : I have to get the fuck out of Gig . <p> I do n't think of myself as more pessimistic than the next boy brought up in a town where the high-school driver 's ed teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episode only made me think that  --  if the telephone pole had n't been there-perhaps I 'd 've been knocked clean out of the county , that I could 've landed in a town with a local newspaper that came out twice a week , or one where they sold square pieces of cheese in the grocery store . I took the accident as an omen , sure , but not the kind of sign my old childhood neighbors took twenty-five years later that caused fake tornadoes to scatter their trailers , so their entire lives could be unwrapped on national television . <p> " You have to go help your father out , " my wife said to me . " The least you could do is pull mobile-home axles out of the way so the search goes better . " <p> I said , " Everyone could go to jail for this , Martha . Understand , it 's against the law . " <p> Here 's the story : I crawled out of my hospital bed and tried to hitchhike away . My father caught me on Highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gig until the age of eighteen , he 'd make sure to have enough money to let me go off to college twice and never come back . And that 's what happened . Let me make it clear that I got along with my father well , and we saw each other often . He took roadtrips at least once a week , whether I lived a hundred or three hundred miles away . <p> Now . Basically , the town of Gig had n't kept up with the nation 's economic recovery ; no new business had opened up in two decades , and the closest towns with factories  --  Columbia , Augusta , Charleston , and Greenwood  --  stood between 70 and 120 miles away , which was too far a commute for anyone with a car that still had fins . My father called me just as I started a new semester teaching pop culture courses at a college in the mountains of North Carolina , a place where rich parents sent children who did n't have the grades or test scores to get in state schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporated literature , philosophy , and art , plus I got to design a new course a year involving my area of interest . This particular semester I taught something called " Movie-Set Backgrounds  --  the Signifier and Signified . " <p> Anyway , my father called , asking my help in pretending to look for victims in this fake tornado scheme . I put him on speakerphone because my wife never wanted to miss a word my father thought up . " We need you here , son . We need someone here who can speak right and convince the media that what happened actually happened . We 're down to a population of less than three hundred . " Then he hung up and called back presently . <p> I knew he was up to another scam . Whenever my father thought up things he should n't have thought up , he called and talked in one-minute intervals , seeing as he thought the government tapped all phone lines . I probably should mention here that my father 's the driver's-ed teacher and coroner . In Gig  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to possess any medical background . The coroner needed to know that a person burned like barbecue probably died from a fire , and that someone with a bullet hole in his or her head probably died from a gunshot wound . The coroner needed to understand rope burns and elementary mathematics . There was no test : just a vote , and slight postelection ceremony . <p> Of course , my father got voted in as coroner back when people only died of old age and car wrecks . I guess the townspeople figured he should be coroner seeing as it was his fault for not teaching kids how to drive well , and that he only needed to know basic math for people who died of natural causes . My father named me Park , because of his job . It could 've been worse . He could 've named me Brake , or Signal . My father and I got along , even though I told him he had no right to let people call him Dr. Bardin just because he was coroner . I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it ? " <p> My father said , " Bigger . " He 'd once helped Big Jim Shorts fit deflated footballs on plain opossums . Big Jim told people they were special armadillos . He did n't bother to paint them or anything , so the animals were known as Spalding and Wilson . My father got the idea from an old man up in the mountains . It got Big Jim a letter from the SPCA . <p> I said , " I had another dream that I should never come back home . I had a dream that I 'd get hit by another car . " For some reason I 'd make a yearly point to tell my father how I considered myself born again when I slid down that telephone pole , that my rebirth involved a Ford Galaxie , etcetera . My father made a point to tell me that my birth involved a brand-new 1957 Oldsmobile , a trip to Myrtle Beach , and a supper involving fried oysters and calabash shrimp . <p> My father did n't hear me then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . We polled everybody old enough to pee standing , and it came out unanimous . We 've got a guy with a wrecking ball he ai n't used since the last silo , and two tow-truck drivers who promise to donate their time and money knocking over trailers and jerking roofs from their rafters . We got enough bulldozers . I know you 're not one to ever get your hands dirty . I know you people living in your ivory towers fear blisters and calluses more than anything else . But I bet your dean would be proud of you on the TV when they ask where you 're from and you say you teach at that college , and so on . It 'll make you look like a humanitarian and everything . " <p> I stood in my kitchen and stared hard at the clock , trying to make the hour hand spin backward . I said , " Y'all do n't even have insurance . Most people down there do n't believe in insurance . I do n't get the scare . " <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We just want some attention . Federal funds will take care of what the insurance do n't . Listen , every other American gets prayers sent their way when there 's a flood , earthquake , hurricane , tornado , or killing spree . Gig deserves it . Hell , influenza do n't even visit us anymore every winter , Park . " <p> I thought this : my people want pity . It 's the first time , ever , I 'd thought about the citizens of Gig as " my people . " I did n't break down crying or anything . I said , " You know I 'm not worried about blisters and calluses , Dad , " and he hung up . I nodded when Martha came out of the bedroom with a packed suitcase and our tent . At that point I realized that my story would begin elsewhere . <p> I picked the time I got hit by a Galaxie at random , really ; actually , I spent more than a few months of my childhood wearing white gauze wrapped around my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was uncoordinated . To be honest , most of my dozen concussions occurred right after my father said , " Hey , Park , see if you can ... " either jump off the roof , or hold tight to the sideboard of a VW while he backed full-speed down the driveway before hitting the brakes , or slide down a steep hill on a snow disk without going in the creek , etcetera . One time he put my bare shoulder against the back of the house and let me shoot his 30.06 . It backfired , my head hit the bricks hard , and I was out . I think I was seven that time . <p> My mother  --  who left us when I was only four  --  was a deep-socketed woman , and my father said that 's the only feature of hers that I owned , I 'm no psychologist , but I 'd bet that somewhere in his subconscious he wanted me to hit my head until my eyeballs popped properly forward and filled their surrounding and protective bones so he would n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Throughout my childhood my father offered only non sequiturs about my mother , things like , " Your mother went off to work at the eraser factory . " <p> I never knew what he meant , and I did n't ask . Usually I sat off in a corner , my head lolling back and forth uncontrollably . I know this : my mother called herself a professor , though she only taught typing and shorthand at a technical college in south Georgia . Somewhere along the line I got in my head that she was a true feminist , and that she taught future secretaries little tricks so they could fuck up their bosses and whatnot , and later take over entire corporations . To be honest , I think she taught regular old shorthand and typing , though , out of those odd-shaped Gregg hardback books . <p> Martha and I drove back roads south to Gig  --  as if there were a choice . The interstate systems that crisscross South Carolina  --  namely 95 , 26 , and 20  --  do n't come close to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd not noticed in a while . Our trunk and backseat were packed , and she carried two books : one on first aid , the other Thucydides ' History o the Peloponnesian War . I said , " I do n't know if I need to tell you that this is all a secret , honey . You understand how this is the dumbest scheme my father 's ever told me about . " <p> My wife pulled her left leg sideways on the front seat and turned halfway . She looked like a 4 . She said , " It 's another adventure with Dr. Bardin . I think it 's a cool idea . " Among other things that I 'll get to later , Martha worked at the local School for the Deaf . She was the librarian . She spent most of her time in total silence , outside of someone dropping a book on the carpet . " You 're going to inherit your daddy 's land someday . There 's no reason why it should n't get a boost , no matter how . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a habit . It 's the major reason why she never drove when we went somewhere . I never picked up the language , for I knew enough of French and bread-making : I figured my brain was filled up enough . Sometimes when I kneaded dough Martha would say something like , " You just signed out Hotdog OK , Coffee , Land of Fuck-Whip , ' " or whatever . Sometimes I could n't even eat what I 'd baked after she told me what I signed making the stuff . <p> I said , " All these television stations now have Doppler radar , and Super Doppler . I do n't know how the people of Gig are going to be able to convince anyone that a tornado hit when the weather map showed no storm activity in a two-state area . " <p> " That 's what makes this so exciting . That 's what makes it a challenge , Park . How 're you going to explain it , seeing as you 've been voted spokesperson ? " <p> I said , " Deus ex machina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident I could pull it off . I 'd once taught a course called " What the Hell Was That ?  --  A Look at Greek Tragedy Through Textual Hermeneutics . " <p> I dodged dead animals . Martha repositioned herself and said , " Hey , I hope that old clothing store 's still open in Gig . I bet I can get some good old mannequins out of that place , seeing as they 'd have to be scattered by a fake tornado . " <p> This is Martha 's other job , her real job , the job she does before and after work signing Dr. Seuss and Uncle Remus stories : my wife makes chip-dip holders and hors d'oeuvre trays out of mannequins . She cuts through the belly with a jigsaw , sands down the rough edge , repaints the torso , and sticks a Tupperware container in the cavity . What started off as a minor escapade at flea markets has turned into a legitimate moneymaking business . Her pieces sell at between one and two hundred dollars at boutiques and art galleries , mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not making dip holders out of the torsos , she 's making smoking stands from the legs . <p> " You 've never been to Gig , " I said . " How do you know about a clothing store ? There 's nothing in Gig . People who want to wear clothes need to drive far away , or make them out of feed sacks . A lot of people in my hometown go naked , honey . I did n't want to tell you that . " <p> We 'd only been married two years . We drove up to Gatlinburg to one of those wedding chapels and honeymooned in Dayton , Tennessee , where the Scopes Monkey Trial took place back in 1925 . Martha and I met at the School for the Deaf when I got hired through grant money to teach a week-long seminar on the " History of Silent Movies and Their Impact on Existentialism . " <p> Martha said , " Your daddy brought me pictures . Your daddy thinks that even if you 're not happy about your growing-up years , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you ask me . " <p> The town council voted to use tax money to buy my father a camera so he could take pictures of dead people . My father rode around , more often than not , in the passenger seat of the driver 's ed car , slamming down the instructor 's brake in order to take snapshots of things he thought interesting . Mostly he took photographs of birds and farm animals . I suppose it 's possible that somebody 's cow got loose in front of Fashions by Lemuel , next to Gig 's Froggy Diner . <p> I did n't hear what Martha said . I drove south , trying to think of how to describe a tornado without saying it sounded like a freight train . <p> Here 's the layout : to the south , north , and west of Gig stands the Savannah River Plant , a place where nuclear bombs were supposedly made back when I grew up falling down , where now only forty-nine other states and no telling how many foreign countries armed with merchant ships sent their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money received from this storage rental will go to education , so that glowing students can sit in front of computers or something . The legislature votes yearly that gambling and the lottery 's a sin , and that even though other states amass enough money to put their students in state colleges for free , South Carolina 's children are better off in the long run drinking tainted water , etcetera . <p> I do n't get it , but do n't need to , seeing as I left Gig for good a few years after I thought my story began . <p> Martha and I drove down Highway 25 until we reached the 125 obtain-pass-at-gate road that no one used anymore , then five miles south took an illegal dirt road to the left . I knew that either no one would be monitoring the little cameras nailed to various withered trees , or that they would n't be in working order anyway . We crossed over steamy creeks with wretched half-trunks poking out , past clumps of moss that weighed down their shriveled hosts . Martha quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my old stomping grounds , " I said . " Gosh , I remember playing hide-and-seek out here at night with my friends when we were kids . It did n't take much to find anyone . " <p> Martha clucked her tongue . " Every sci-fi movie about the apocalypse should be filmed down here . This is creepy . " <p> I drove right at ninety miles an hour . It 's not like any cops , pedestrians , or oncoming traffic would be around . I said , " We 're about twenty minutes away . We 'll be coming up on the west side of town . " <p> I knew that if what Dad told me was true , he 'd have people up and down Old Spook Pond Road watching for strangers . He 'd have some kind of walkie-talkie system going in case someone drove up confused . The people of Gig would n't want anyone seeing them knocking down their own trailers , of course . <p> Martha and I entered town from a road no one used , one that probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing as talk abounded of lizard monsters and other assorted nuclear swamp beings . We crested the only hill in the area , and I stopped . Below us , in a beautiful , panoramic way , the townspeople could be seen working hard together : a wrecking ball swung purposefully and knocked down a single-wide with one stroke . Both tow-truck drivers hooked up their lines and stood cars on end . People crouched atop their own houses and ripped off shingles whole sheets at a time . Big Jim Shorts practiced with his fainting goats and his small herd of cows he taught to play dead . Right in the middle I saw my father , standing atop his driver's-ed car , bullhorn in hand , giving either directions or a pep talk , nodding up and down like a preacher on a trampoline . <p> My wife and I watched my people pushing mopeds and bicycles into ditches , and some woman on a bulldozer drove around aimlessly , pushing over pine trees . Behind her , two boys with rakes tried to hide the tracks . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away . Sometimes I wonder if I come from a sect who broke away from the Travelers , like maybe everyone around here did n't like picayune scams . " <p> Martha nodded . She said , " It 's not unlike watching an ant farm , Park . I 'll admit this is a little weirder than I imagined . " In town-which basically consisted of Lemuel 's clothing store , the diner , a barber , and ten vacant storefronts  --  people broke windows and scattered the glass on the sidewalk , as if the panes had been sucked out by a tornado . It might be easier to see my hometown by what it does n't own : there were no 7-Eleven-type stores , no grocery store , no laundromat . There was n't an old-fashioned feed-and-seed , no dry cleaner , furniture store , pharmacy , army-navy surplus , ice cream parlor , no H &; R Block . People had to lose a quarter tank of gas to go fill up at a station forty miles away . There used to be all these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was once a drive-in theater on the outskirts of Gig , but the last movie shown was Deliverance : I think everybody quit going once they thought Hollywood only made realistic movies that offered no means of escape for the citizens . <p> I watched the town idiot  --  who used to be my English teacher in high school  --  throw his unicycle up into an overgrown wisteria . <p> Both churches , long out of use , were leveled . I was n't sure if anyone held faith in Gig anymore , but I knew that believers must'ye driven to Augusta or someplace on Sundays . The two ministers who used to tend First Baptist and First Pentecostal left around the time Nixon resigned . I remember one old preacher telling my dad that he could n't live off IOUs in the collection plate . <p> I said , " It 's not unlike one of those Broadway musicals . " I reached under my seat and pulled out a thermos of martinis I 'd brought along . Martha opened the glove compartment and removed two plastic fold-up travel cups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no appropriate toast to make . Martha signed something that I did n't quite catch , outside of the motion for " insane . " I decided it was time to go on down and help my father . <p> Get this : I drove slowly about fifty yards before someone noticed that a stranger approached . I 'm not sure who gave the signal , but the people of Gig  --  even the fainting goats  --  all fell down at once , as if something from the heavens had picked them up earlier and now dropped and scattered them simultaneously . <p> One summer when I was twelve  --  only halfway through my series of concussions-I somehow got a job helping Daney Mitchell clean his barn and outbuildings , load up what he could sell on the back of his pickup truck , and drive to a flea market in Columbia . Daney Mitchell needed to move out of state . He said he could n't take the pressure of being a celebrity where the last famous person happened to be a member of the Confederate army . <p> Daney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he 'd gone on a killing spree down in Charleston . Evidently he poisoned some rich people , and stabbed some other rich people , and shot a lawyer or two , and maybe even burned down a jewelry store . His actions kind of multiplied each year . Whatever he did , according to everyone , got him a death-penalty sentence . On the morning of his execution the guards came in and asked what he wanted for his last supper . Daney Mitchell supposedly sat there staring off . <p> One guard said , " You can have anything you want . Steak . Shrimp . Macaroni and cheese . " <p> Daney Mitchell said , " I want a tire . I want a big raw rubber tire . " <p> At six that night  --  of course he was to be electrocuted at midnight , just like in the movies I showed my students when I taught a seminar called " Gangsters , Molls , and Hegelian Dialectic "  --  the guards brought him a Goodyear , but no knife . Daney Mitchell said thanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only got about halfway through eating that tire bite by bite , holding it on his lap in the little cell like a giant doughnut . At midnight they led him into the execution chamber , strapped him up , and pulled the lever . <p> He just sat there with a hood on his head . He did n't shake , throb , or have his eyeballs pop out . According to my people , Daney Mitchell had so much rubber inside his body  --  and he rubbed trace amounts of the tire all over his skin , too , an invisible sheen  --  that he 'd become nonconductive . Somewhere in his sentence there was a loophole that stated if he survived the shock , then he 'd be let free , which is just what happened . <p> Every one of those Believe-It-or-Not types of magazines and books had big write-ups on Daney Mitchell , though I never saw one . As a matter of fact I never looked , seeing as I did n't want to know the truth . For me , Daney Mitchell was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm sure that when I tried to hitchhike out of Gig , Daney Mitchell 's story , somewhere down in my unconscious , is what made me stick out a thumb . <p> I did n't ask Daney anything , either . We loaded his pickup with old single- and doubletrees , yokes , plow stocks , barrels , barn spikes , and whatnot , and drove to the capital to sell them off at a place that became the state fair once a year . Daney drove and said , " I got this story to tell you , Park . I want you to listen closely , OK ? " <p> I said , " I promise . " I thought he might let me in on how to chew a tire correctly should I ever practice heinous and horrific actions that would earn me a death sentence . <p> Daney rolled his window up so I could hear better . He said , " One time the ears died , and the rest of the body tried to figure out who needed to bury them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes could go out , bury the ears , and find their way back . But the eyes did n't want to go outside the body , and said they might just bury the ears and never return , what do y'all think about that ? The lungs said they could n't go , because they were like fish out of water when they left the body . The spleen and liver chimed up , saying they were needed to stay inside the body to clean up what the blood brought to them , and mentioned how the rest of the body would wither off by the time they got back from burying the ears . " <p> This is no lie : about this point I thought about jumping right out of the truck . I 'd already had a couple concussions at thirty miles an hour , and figured fifty would n't be that different . I said , " I 've never heard this one , " hoping it was only a joke and not something with inner meaning . <p> Daney Mitchell said , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hear this one in all of South Carolina , boy . " He said , " OK . The heart went the same route as the liver and spleen , and the intestines said they might get mistaken for a snake outside the body and some woman with a hoe would chop them in pieces . So . The body just lay there with dead ears for a while until the organs all said , ' I think the larynx should go . The body can live without a larynx for a good few days , in case burying the ears takes time . ' The larynx said , ' I do n't want to go out there , ' and so on , but he got outvoted and had to go . The other organs shoved him right outside of the body . <p> " Well , I 'm not quite sure what a larynx looks like , but the larynx never came back . I do n't know if it got chopped up like the intestines thought they would , or if it just dried up and died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears . But I know this : once the larynx was gone , the rest of the body died soon thereafter . When the lungs started to hurt , and then the heart , the larynx was n't there to mention it to the brain . When the kidneys failed and the intestines formed tiny holes in themselves , the larynx was n't there to explain some things , to yell out a warning , if you know what I mean . " <p> This was summer . Men on tractors worked their fields . I could n't get out of my mind a pair of ears in a little box underneath the soil . I said , " They should 've picked the appendix . It 's not much use anymore , from what my daddy told me . " <p> Daney Mitchell , the man who beat the electric chair by eating a tire , nodded . He said , " That 's not bad thinking . But you know what-even the appendix still had hope of doing something . You ca n't vote for something to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential . The body needs to understand that , Park . The body needs to understand that it needs a larynx maybe more than it needs anything else . " <p> Daney Mitchell honked his horn and laughed out loud . When I was a first-year college student I realized that he probably did n't eat a tire and miss the electric chair . I realized that Daney Mitchell , more likely than not , only left his parents ' farm and went to further his education , that his parents were embarrassed about a kid from Gig wanting to do something besides farming , that more than likely it was Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell who made up the story of Daney going to jail . <p> I realized that Daney Mitchell was a communist . <p> " I see a couple of them trying to crawl under debris . Man , they got this thing down to a science , " Martha said as we continued down the western dirt road into Gig . <p> The first person I made out beside my father was Daney Mitchell . Daney never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his forehead and did n't make eye contact with the car that penetrated the ruptures and limits of my hometown  --  which , of course , happened to be my car . Daney patterned the berm a hundred yards from the first church demolished , and I pulled up next to him and said , " I knew you 'd be back . " <p> Daney said , " It was terrible . It was something no one expected . It sounded like a train , man , " which reminded me to think up similes for the television crews my father told me to expect . <p> I leaned over my wife and said through her open window , " Mr. Mitchell , it 's Park Bardin . I know all about the tornadoes . " I wore my seat belt , and remembered how there was n't a cop within miles . <p> Daney Mitchell , who was n't but fifty years old  --  I 'd thought of him as being fifty when we did n't sell any single- or doubletrees , any yokes , harnesses , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier  --  put his hand in his pocket and said , " Hey , Park . Your daddy told me you 'd be showing up to help us out . " He bent down and stuck his hand past Martha . " Hot damn , that was a close one , " he said , then turned around and yelled to everyone acting knocked out , " It 's OK ; it 's only Dr. Bardin 's boy . " <p> My people got up as if they 'd practiced doing handsprings . I blew the horn a couple times , just like Daney did driving to the flea market a generation before . I said , " You 're back , again , " to Daney . I put the car in park and got out . It was n't like I had to pull over on the berm or anything . Martha opened her door but just sat there . <p> Daney said , " I come back and forth , you know . I go away , and then I come back , and then I go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's not all that much different than being a human tide , Park . Sometimes I think I can get out of here , go to Detroit or someplace that needs some common worker 's sense put in , and then the next thing you know I need to come back here where people still know me for who I am . For people who still respect me for beating the odds and all . Your daddy tells me you 're teaching college . I guess you understand what I mean . " <p> I did n't say anything about the tire . I said , " I know what you mean . This is my wife , Martha . She 's got her own communist tendencies , " even though she did n't . <p> My father came running up and said , " Park , Park , Park , " like that . I 'd not seen him in a few months , and he 'd grown a look about him not unlike that of a man standing in the shadow of a sudden dark and fishy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I still think this is a dumb idea even if y'all have gotten it down to a regular ballet . I thought you needed us here to get our hands dirty and whatnot . " <p> Martha got out , kissed my father on the cheek , and grinned . Daney Mitchell put both his hands in back pockets . My father said , " Ah , hell , I just said that to get you pissed off and down here . We 've been turning the town over for a week now . We 're just about ready . " Then he looked at the sky and said , " How 's the world of meteorology ? Today 's a good day for meteorology , ai n't it ? " <p> I looked at my wife . I said , " I do n't know . " <p> My father said , " You teach meteorology . Give us the go-ahead , boy . There are some cloudy conditions in Alabama . How long you think it 'll take for the storm front to hit us ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things , Dad , but not meteorology . They teach that at state colleges . They teach meteorology at schools with real science departments . " <p> Everyone from my hometown started back working at what they needed to tear down . I knew the faces , but not many of the names . There seemed to be an inordinate number of dogs roaming around . My father said , " Oh . " <p> " You 're thinking of anthropology . I teach a course sometimes about how human beings are different because they have opposable thumbs . I do n't know about the weather . " <p> My father said , " Well , a tornado just passed through here , as far as I 'm concerned . I 'm the coroner , so I guess I know tornadoes as well as you do . Goddamn , it 's been bad . " He waved his arm behind him . He did one of those sweeping game-show things for me to look at all the destruction . " I think we 're about ready . We 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get you to call up all the television stations or something . " <p> Daney Mitchell said to me , " This might be the best idea I 've come across . Understand this was n't my idea , but it 's a good one . " <p> Martha said , " Where should we pitch this tent ? " and pointed in the backseat . She hitched her pants by the naked loops , as if she grew up in Gig . <p> My father , Daney Mitchell , and I said , " Not yet , " at the same time , which kind of scared me . <p> I said , " You got the Doppler radar thing and the Super Doppler to worry about . How 's everyone going to explain a series of tornadoes when the radar showed nothing ? " <p> Martha closed the passenger door . She walked down an embankment to help people scatter picnic tables and whatnot . My father said , " We thought you 'd be able to explain that . " <p> Daney Mitchell bowed up . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doppler do n't mean jack shit . Let me tell you this , and I 'm a man who knows : they keep telling you and telling you about their radar , but in reality it 's just a few guys they hired to stand in fields twenty , fifty , and a hundred miles away . They got cellular phones . When things look bad they call up the TV station and say things look bad . That 's it . Think about it . There 've been enough tornadoes and hurricanes no one expected , not to mention plain old thunderstorms . Fuck America . Fuck everyone . " <p> I looked at my father and said , " See ? " <p> My father said , " Your head 's been hit hard too many times , remember . " He said to me , " You 're still the man who 's going to talk to everyone . We voted . " <p> Daney Mitchell nodded . He motioned for Big Jim Shorts to go ahead and knock down the power lines , seeing as no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telephone from his pocket . He closed his eyes and made a noise not unlike the air escaping a body 's lungs when something of consequence was about to take leave . <p> The first woman to talk to me was n't from one of the big networks . She was n't a woman who 'd worked her way up from college , from a local station last in the ratings or whatever . She was from Augusta , Georgia , where everyone waited and waited for a golf tournament once a year . The first reporter on the scene was a woman named Jill Shore , and she bobbed her head at the end of every sentence . <p> I 'd been the one to call her , of course . Daney handed me a few numbers ; I called people in Charleston , Augusta , Columbia , and Greenville , and I suppose regular idiot weathermen interrupted programming to say there was a tornado watch for central western South Carolina , that they had reporters going to the scene , etcetera . <p> Jill Shore 's cameraman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I knew he wanted to somehow work his way up from cameraman to anchor , from anchor to daytime soap operas . Clint wore blue jeans one size too tight and put mousse in his hair . When he shook my hand , he went past my palm and grabbed my wrist . It was like some kind of hipster handshake , or some Star Trek cult handshake . I did n't get it . It gave me the creeps . <p> Or maybe it was Gladys Phillips moaning from beneath her house trailer , pretending to be trapped . <p> Jill Shore said to me off camera , " I need to get some facts before we go live . Are you from here ? " <p> Martha sat on a nearby stump with her head in her hands , faking sobs . I said , " I 'm from here originally . I just happened to be visiting my father . I come to visit my father , you know , maybe once a month . " I gave her my name , and so on . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that moment I realized I was n't a good son , was n't a good Gigian , or Gigite , or whatever people from Gig called themselves . <p> Jill Shore bobbed her head . She said , " Was it like a freight train ? " <p> Two ambulances screamed in from Barnwell , the nearest town . I pointed to where Gladys Phillips whimpered , where ten or twelve men  --  including my English teacher , Daney Mitchell , and my father  --  pretended to move awnings , statuary , pink flamingos , whirligigs , garbage cans , and a lawn mower from the front door facing skyward . I said , " Yes , it sounded like a freight train . And it was very windy . " <p> Jill Shore said , " OK . " She turned to Clint Winchester and asked , " Are we ready ? " Clint nodded , and a red light came on his little minicam . <p> Someone behind us yelled out , " My baby , my baby , " like that , realistic . <p> Jill Shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene in the small town of Gig , South Carolina , where a number of tornadoes have set down . All around us is death and destruction . I 'm here with Park Bardin , and Park , you were just visiting here , right ? " <p> She turned her body ninety degrees and pushed the microphone my way . I froze . It was n't so much that behind me a bunch of people I barely remembered yelled out , knowing their lines and places . It was n't so much that I felt some kind of moral obligation to report the truth , or that I felt deep down my wife would judge me for playing along with my people 's scam . I did n't think about any of those **25;1052;TOOLONG scenarios I liked to teach to rich kids without proper college-board credentials . I said , " It sounded like a hundred crazed women screaming all at once . It sounded like a hundred crazed women , all angry at their husbands , on their way to one of those conferences where people chant out things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 've heard that it sounded like a freight train , " Jill Shore said to me . <p> I thought , Do not say that it was windy ; do not say that it was windy , like every other trailer-park tornado victim says . I said , " It came out of nowhere . It sounded like a hundred crazed screaming women aboard a freight train . It 's all melted now , but that tornado brought along with it hail the size of hermit crabs , or gallstones , or Amish dumplings , or shrunken heads . " <p> Jill Shore turned to face the cameraman . She said , " Our meteorologist Gene Frank is back at the studio to tell us what we can do to escape catastrophe during tornado season . " <p> Evidently the people in Augusta saw something we did n't see in Gig . Of course my father and his comrades had knocked down the power lines . Jill Shore turned to me when we were off camera and said , " Amish dumplings ? What are you , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got up from her stump . I said , " Well , at least I can pronounce words . I 've seen you on TV before . At least I know the state capitals , and how to say them , pinhead . " <p> Some real reporters showed up soon thereafter , including stringers for CNN . I stood on my spot with the town of Gig behind me and waited to give answers better than the first . In my mind I developed images of funnel clouds descending . I thought about a course I could teach in the coming year called " Theater of the Absurd and the Aerobics of Country Music Lyrics . " The people of Gig feigned sighs , moans , applause , and cheers . Stray dogs roamed freely . Clint Winchester tried to turn his camera in the direction of what happened . Someone wheeled out some generators and got some spotlights going so we could work all night picking up debris and investigating the damages . The EMS men and women got Gladys Phillips out of her flipped trailer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's growth . She used to teach Sunday school before the preachers left . She cut hair all day Saturdays and most weekday afternoons . Gladys sewed the cheerleaders ' uniforms , and spent her own money taking kids to Governor 's School for the Arts auditions , though none of them ever got accepted . <p> Gladys shoveled mashed potatoes onto Gig children 's plates at the junior high school , and made me the human being I turned out to be . <p> The next morning I stood on a makeshift soundstage made out of pallets recovered from the old Devore lumberyard , a place that had n't been in business since someone around Gig discovered either bricks or mobile homes . I tried to look into the cameras and appear both concerned and honest , even conjured up a tear when we got word that one of those fishermen with his own Saturday-morning show set up a fund for the people of Gig because he 'd once had help with a flat tire on his boat trailer nearby . Martha stood behind me , signing like crazy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone from one station said the governor had declared Gig a disaster area and that federal funds would be showing up soon after the Red Cross volunteers did . I could only think to myself : My wife ' s mannequins with guacamole bellies make more money than what 's coming here . There 's something wrong with the way things work . <p> When the cameras were n't rolling , Martha and I pretended to clear paths , to comfort men whose dreams appeared shattered , etcetera . <p> " Now we 're getting the attention we deserve , " my father said to me between interviews . He did n't move his lips or anything . " Look at all the women . " He pointed at reporters , camera crews , and volunteers . <p> It was at this point that I realized there were no women left in Gig to speak of  --  that they had either died off or taken the same road out of town that my mother took . There were n't any children under the age of puberty , either . Maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women and children left for relatives ' houses far away or L-shaped motels up and down the little-used two-lane roads that used to be major New York-to-Florida thoroughfares . <p> I said , " Is this whole thing going on because y'all could n't get any women to stay in Gig ? " <p> My father still spoke without moving his lips . " It 's almost a shame that a bunch of men are going away in the Red Cross van way over to Columbia . They 're keeping up a front , you know . We held a lottery to see who 'd go and who 'd stay around . I 'm thinking that even the ones who have to go are going to meet some people , though . Old man Becker broke his own ankle on purpose just so he 'd get to meet a nurse . " My father wore this khaki outfit that , I suppose , he was sworn to wear during crises . It had a badge on the left shirt-pocket and everything . He stood next to me surveying sham damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing this , Park . Goddamn , I might send a letter to the president of Bangladesh next time they need to fake monsoon season so those Hollywood people get everybody to send five bucks a month . " <p> Martha came down the street lugging two mannequins . She said , " Look what Lemuel gave me . He said he 'll tell the insurance people they flew away . " She kissed me on the cheek . <p> I said , " Do n't talk to any of the men again , Martha . Promise me this : do n't talk to any man from Gig . I 'll explain later . " <p> She put the mannequins in the tent we had pitched and never crawled into , ten yards from where I 'd done all the interviews . The only chance I had to speak with Martha during the evening of the catastrophe was in between my interviews and her looking for someone 's pet rooster . She said to me , " This is what I imagine football to be like . These are all like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying " Let 's get in the tent and do an end-around " about ten minutes after she 'd vanished , of course . <p> As the sun hit midmorning , my father said , " Here come the contractors , " and pointed at two vans driving slowly into town . " They 'll need a place to stay . We already got Johnny Bishop 's Rest-a-Bit cleaned up and ready for strangers out on Old Savannah Road . We did n't tear off its roof . " <p> I said , " Dad . There are n't any kids in Gig anymore . Who exactly are you teaching at the high school ? " <p> This man stuck a microphone in my face and said he was from Channel 9 Live Action News , like there was n't but one of them . He asked me to give a description of how everyone down here deals with tornado seasons , year after year . I said , " The South blows . It really blows in the South . " <p> My father said , " Ca n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pushed the reporter away . To me he said , " There ai n't no kids at Gig High . We have n't had a child in school since ten years after you left . We make up names and pretend . We send in fake test scores to the Department of Education , fake attendance rolls . All of us go into work every day , but mostly we play cards . I ai n't ever told you this one ? " <p> I said , " You must 've had something else on your mind . " <p> My father said , " We 're real proud . Last year our kids scored fifty points above the state average on the SAT . It was a regular minor miracle . It 's also a miracle that no one 's ever shown up and checked on us . We got it figured out if they do , though  --  field trip , the flu , cut day . " My father looked into the distance and gave a thumbs-up . Big Jim Shorts fired up a bulldozer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a ride in the driver's-ed car and still sit in the passenger seat . I like to think that I 'm teaching a ghost how to drive . " <p> I called out to Martha , " Pack up the tent . " <p> We got home in time to turn on the Weather Channel and see replays of my interviews and more updated segments . Sure enough , each meteorologist got on there and said Doppler radar just missed it : sometimes the heavens opened up within a micronanosecond not yet known to man or machine . <p> Daney Mitchell took over as spokesman for Gig , evidently . He did n't cry or anything , but he looked right in the camera and said that if anyone out there could find it in themselves to send money , the people of Gig would appreciate it . He said , " We do n't really need toys or clothes . This was a freak tornado . Nobody 's clothes or toys got injured . Hey , if any of you women out there got a vacation coming up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which I 'm sure went over well with the feminist set . <p> Martha said , " I know you 're embarrassed , Park , but it 's not your fault . Sure , I know that some members of the psychology profession think environment plays a larger part in the psyche than anything else , but do n't worry about it . If I were you I would n't think twice about maybe later on in life thinking up ways to scam people out of their time and money and emotions . " <p> I pressed the button on the answering machine and got bombarded with every student I 'd ever taught calling to say they saw me on television . Instead of writing down their numbers on the pad I kept nearby , I scribbled an idea for another special course : " Friedrich Nietzsche and the History of Counterfeiting God . " I said to my wife , " Man , this is trouble . Somehow all of this is going to come back to me . I do n't want to spend time in prison for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What would you want to spend time in prison for ? " She stood up her two new mannequins and said , " The fingers are cut off these things . I bet Lemuel cut them off on purpose , so people in Gig would feel at home in his store . " <p> I said , " I do n't want to go to prison for anything . I do n't want to do anything . I do n't want to teach , and I do n't want to work a nine-to-five job . I hate to say it , but if my people pull off this stupid fake tornado , truly I ca n't see what use there is to live a regular life . " <p> Martha pulled the jigsaw and extension cord out into the living room . She said , " I 'll vacuum up the mess , " and excavated the mannequins ' bellies within two minutes . Martha said , " I might paint these things with an eye toward what happened in Gig . I 'll paint overturned trailers all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed a bourbon and bourbon . I sat at the table and thought about what I needed to teach in the morning , or what I 'd say . " My father told me he still had all the receipts from everything he ever bought my mother . He said he was going to tell the insurance agents that her jewelry box went missing . " <p> My wife did n't look up . She said , " I 'll admit that your daddy might get himself into trouble . I 'll admit that the guy who never really ate a tire and everybody else might get in trouble . You do n't have to worry , though . Believe me , Park , you have an alibi for all this . " <p> I did n't want to hear it . I said , " I 'm right on camera telling the world about a phantom tornado , you idiot . " <p> My wife laughed . " There 's that old cliche . Behind every successful man , you know . " <p> I did n't get it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non sequiturs sometimes . " I 'm not exactly successful , " I said . I drank from my bourbon . I drummed my fingers on the table . I looked over at Martha setting a Tupperware bowl in a mannequin . I thought about a woman from CNN wearing a dress and rubber galoshes . " What did you sign behind me when I gave those interviews ? " <p> Martha looked up . " Let 's just say that you wo n't be getting in any trouble should word leak out . Let 's just say that I may have mentioned how it was a terrible scene  --  just like you said  --  but that it was n't your fault . That you did n't have anything to do with it . That you did n't even know these people anymore . " <p> I did not answer my wife . I did n't look up or thank her immediately . I thought forward , and could only wonder how my father and his friends would defend themselves , and speculated that their only argument might be similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury that living in such close proximity to a nuclear dumping ground caused a certain paranoia and lack of understanding reality . I saw myself on the witness stand , too , explaining how I grew up in a place where the most famous person ate rubber , where the driver's-ed teacher felt it necessary to teach specters what they needed to know most , namely how to operate a vehicle on their way to a more conducive place to haunt , a place where their own stories could begin . <p> <p> By George Singleton <p>
