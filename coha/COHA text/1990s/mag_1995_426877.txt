Section : Culture &; ideas When exotic species invade a habitat , it can be ecologically disastrous <p> Jonathan Saito of the Hawaii Department of Agriculture has a mission impossible . Armed with a flashlight and aided by a beagle named Juice , he is charged with searching the underbodies of jets arriving from Guam for brown tree snakes . But Juice 's nose only reaches partway up the plane 's massive wheels , and Saito 's flashlight barely illuminates the cavernous wells overhead . Indeed , his best hope for saving Hawaii from the snakes that ate Guam 's birds is that the plane will leave on time . A prompt departure means that the wheel wells will still be cold from the flight , and chilly snakes are generally too sluggish to slither from the plane onto the ground . <p> The brown tree snake is just one of the rapacious biological invaders that have wreaked havoc around the world . Carried by a burgeoning tide of international travel and commerce , ever more plants and animals are colonizing new landscapes . While some foreign species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economies and ecosystems . The brown tree snake slipped onto Guam from southwestern Pacific islands in the late 1940s . Since then , it has wiped out 9 of 11 native bird species , leaving the forests eerily quiet . This nocturnal climber also goes after sleeping babies  --  though the bite is n't fatal . And thanks to the snake 's fondness for climbing  --  and shorting out  --  electrical lines , Guam experiences a power outage approximately every four days . <p> Prolific plants . Other biological nightmares : The invasive purple loosestrife , which chokes wetlands and waterways throughout the Northern tier states , causes an estimated $46 million in losses annually . Weeds such as yellow star thistle and leafy spurge gallop across 4,600 acres of Western federal lands every day . The zebra mussel hitched a ride from Europe to the United States in the ballast of oceangoing ships in the late 1980s . Now , it clogs water intake and treatment systems throughout the Great Lakes and the Illinois and Hudson rivers . <p> The costs are huge and growing . According to a 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species each year cost American farmers $2 billion to $3 billion in crop losses and about $2 billion in pesticides . They also imperil significant parts of America 's biological heritage . In many places , invaders are transforming diverse ecosystems into impoverished communities composed of a handful of cosmopolitan weeds . Indeed , some conservationists now rank invasive species among the top menaces to endangered species . " We 're losing more habitat here to pests than to bulldozers , " says Alan Holt of the Nature Conservancy of Hawaii . <p> Staring at the future . According to the OTA , this Pacific island hub is a harbinger of what other places will face as global commerce and travel continue to swell . As a remote archipelago , Hawaii was particularly vulnerable to ecological disruption when Polynesian voyagers arrived 1,600 years ago . Having evolved in isolation for millions of years , many native species had discarded evolutionary adaptations that deter predators . The islands abounded with snails with no shells , plants with no thorns and birds that nested on the ground . Polynesian hunters promptly wiped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stowaway in their canoes also did serious damage . The Polynesian rat flourished , decimating dozens of species of ground-nesting birds . The first Europeans and their many plant and animal companions unleashed an even larger wave of extinctions . In 1778 , for instance , Capt . James Cook brought ashore goats , which soon went feral , devastating native plants . <p> Today , more than one half the state 's free-living plant and animal species are of foreign origin . Even the leis visitors get at airports are made mostly from nonnative blooms . Roughly 20 new invertebrates , mostly insects , become established each year . Typically , at least one will prove to be a real biological bully that will cost millions of dollars to control . <p> Biologists Art Medeiros and Lloyd Loope of Haleakala National Park on Maui often feel they are fighting an endless ground war . The park is home to a legion of endangered plants and animals found nowhere else in the world . Six years ago , officials completed a 50-mile , $2.4 million fence to keep out feral goats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to recover , rabbits released into the park by a bored pet owner launched their own assault . Staffers got to work with rifle and snare , but soon after they 'd bagged the last of the rabbits , axis deer  --  miniature elk from India  --  began hopping the fence . <p> Those are just the warmblooded invaders . Medeiros and Loope also are developing chemical weapons for their , thus far , losing battle against the Argentine ant . This tiny terminator threatens to wipe out the park 's native insects and the rare native plants that depend on the insects for pollination . " It 's an eraser , " says Loope . " Shake down a flowering bush inside ant territory and you 'll get five species of native bugs ; outside their range , you 'll get 10 times that . " <p> Killer shade . Another potential " eraser " at the park gates is the Jackson 's chameleon , a colorful Kenyan native that dines on insects and snails . Then there 's the dreaded miconia . Since it was introduced to Tahiti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call the " green cancer " has overrun more than half the island . Its dense foliage shades out other plants  --  from competing trees to the mosses that anchor soils and hold rainwater . As a result , many plants have been pushed to the brink of extinction , and mountainsides are eroding , silting over coral reefs that help sustain fisheries . <p> Maui has several entrenched miconia groves that local , state and federal agencies are spraying with poisons . But when the enemy produces 80 million seeds a year , chemicals only buy time , says Medeiros . The only way to contain the infestation , he says , is to locate and import the fungi and bugs that prey on miconia in its native Central and South America . <p> But siccing pests on pests poses its own problems . Some recruits have run amok , doing as much ecological damage as the pests they were meant to control . In the 1880s , for instance , Hawaiian sugar-cane growers brought in mongooses to prune mice and rat populations . Prune they did , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts have been more successful in recent years . Nearly 90 percent of the agents released in the past two decades have been known to attack only the target pest , according to a study conducted jointly by researchers at the Hawaii Department of Agriculture and the University of Hawaii . <p> By all accounts , preventing invaders from gaining a foothold in the first place is an even better strategy . A recent report by Chris Bright of the Washington D.C.-based Worldwatch Institute recommends , among other measures , that importers be made liable for damages caused by the exotics they introduce and that emergency-response teams be established to jump on new infestations . <p> But even in Hawaii , strengthening defenses is difficult . Many segments of government and industry still have n't awakened to the severity of the problem , contends Larry Nakahara , chief of the state Agriculture Department 's plant quarantine program . He just hopes that it 's not an eerie quiet in Hawaii 's forests that sounds the alarm . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The terminator .
