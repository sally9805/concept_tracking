<p> If you call Bishop John Shelby Spong 's office these days , while you wait for the bishop to pick up the telephone , you 'll hear an instrumental version of the Christmas carol " What Child Is This ? " <p> It is a question Spong and other Christian scholars have been asking with increasing volume and frequency over the last few years . A rash of liberal-to-radical books and seminars have sought to further the quest for the " historical Jesus , " the actual Jewish man who walked the earth and founded the movement known as Christianity . Some theologians make a distinction between the man Jesus and the divine " Christ of faith . " <p> For Spong , the Episcopal bishop of Newark , N.J. , the baby Jesus of Christmas carols is not the child of a virgin mother impregnated by the Holy Spirit . And that 's not the only Christmas tradition he throws out in his book " Born of a Woman , " recently released in paperback . <p> And Spong has company . <p> Scholars have discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last decade controversial books on the life of Jesus have made their way into the popular culture . Many include chapters that attempt to refute the historical and scientific accuracy of the Christmas stories . <p> But those same ancient Christmas stories are a revered staple of the Christian church , held as gospel truth - literally - by millions of the faithful . <p> Still , people on both sides of the argument over the historical accuracy of the Scriptures agree that what they say is less important than what they mean . And people on both sides of the dispute do identify themselves as believers - Christians trying to come to terms with their faith . <p> The virgin birth appears widely in creeds and catechisms . Protestants affirm it regularly in the Apostles ' Creed , which says Jesus was " conceived by the Holy Spirit , born of the Virgin Mary . " And the new Catechism of the Catholic Church , released in English this year , spells out plainly the church 's doctrine that Mary was a virgin when she became pregnant with Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in Nazareth or Bethlehem , whether Mary was a virgin or not , are certainly not as important to me as the relationship Jesus has to healing , his relationship to sin , that is , his speaking for and acting on behalf of God , " said David Moessner , associate professor of New Testament at Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur , who believes the virgin birth actually occurred . <p> Even evangelist Billy Graham , who may be the world 's best-known Christian , told Time magazine he believes in the virgin birth but " it is not necessary for one 's salvation . " <p> On the other side is John Dominic Crossan , a former priest who says the infancy narratives are fable . The stories are " neither factually , actually or biographically true , " said Crossan , whose book " Jesus - A Revolutionary Biography " was published in 1994 . <p> But , he adds , " The Christmas story . . . is not about the biology of Mary . It 's about where do you find God ? Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find him in a peasant child , born in someone else 's stable , born pretty far down in the pecking order of the world ? That 's the challenge of the stories and of Christmas . " <p> Spong also discounts the shepherds in the fields from Luke 's Gospel and the magi from the East introduced by Matthew . <p> " The whole reason for raising this issue is that I think most modern people , if they think about it , would say virgins do not have babies , angels do not sing to hillside shepherds and wise men on camels do not follow stars . Nor do stars travel slowly enough to be followed by wise men on camels , " Spong says . <p> Yet literalism can be intense on both sides , said George Vanderlip , an adjunct professor at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena , Calif . One side is obsessed with the accuracy of every word and letter of the Scriptures , while the other side is equally focused on scientific and historical truths . <p> " When we get hung up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " Vanderlip said . " That 's the tragedy of it . " Vanderlip is author of " Jesus of Nazareth , Teacher and Lord , " which was released this year . <p> Some scholars continue searching for clues <p> Some of the popular Christmas symbols are portrayed in ways that do not even accurately reflect the Bible - which is both history and theology , said Gerald Borchert , professor of New Testament at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville . <p> " Part of our problem is that we 've learned most of the Christmas story from Christmas cards rather than from the text , " he said . <p> Despite this emphasis on the larger meaning of the Scriptures , some scholars continue to examine the minutiae , searching for clues about Jesus . <p> Just this fall a controversial group of biblical scholars unanimously agreed that Jesus ' father was human , not divine . <p> Fellows of the Jesus Seminar , organized in 1985 by former Emory University professor Robert Funk , cast their votes by colored marbles signifying probability . A black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray means probably not , pink means probably and red means the scholar is certain that an event or saying actually occurred . After a two-hour debate at their most recent semiannual meeting , the fellows voted unanimously for a human father . <p> Why this spate of literature and seminars that seem to debunk Christmas stories and other tales of Jesus ? <p> Marcus Borg , professor of religion and culture at Oregon State University , thinks the interest may be linked , consciously or unconsciously , to the approach of the year 2000 . " I think Jesus is likely to be in the news for the rest of the decade , " he says . <p> A growing awareness by Americans of a wide variety of religions , and an increasing level of literacy among some parts of the population , also contribute to broader ways of looking at the Scriptures , he says . <p> Borg 's own spiritual journey is detailed in his 1994 book , " Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time . " <p> " I knew Jesus was ' born of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he wrote . But with increasing skepticism , he went from being a young literalist to an adult atheist before coming back into the faith as a nonliteralist . <p> The microscopic examination of the birth narratives illustrates the kind of debate that is taking place about Jesus in general . Critics cite several difficulties with the Scriptures , including : <p> The impossibility of nailing down all historical events referred to in the birth narratives - things such as a census , a slaughter of children and an astronomical phenomenon that could have created an unusually bright body in the heavens . <p> Apparent disagreements between accounts in Matthew 1:1-17 and Luke 3:23-38 over the ancestral line of Jesus . <p> The lack of any account of the virgin birth in letters from the apostle Paul or in Mark , which many believe is the oldest of the four Gospels . <p> The commonness of stories of divine conceptions - including those of Plato and Romulus and Remus - within other religions and pagan mythology . <p> Defenders of the faith counter with their own arguments : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories . Censuses were taken ; Augustus was emperor and Quirinius was governor of Syria about that time . <p> The authors of the Gospels of Matthew and Luke knew at least as much about what happened at the time as a roomful of 20th-century scholars with a box of colored balls . <p> The detail in the stories , from tracing genealogy to describing the psychological reactions of Mary and Joseph , make them different from pagan accounts of miraculous conceptions - and , therefore , more believable . <p> A God who could create the universe could certainly make a virgin pregnant . <p> The Bible says so . <p> And , whereas those who take the stories literally may be unable to prove every aspect of them historically and scientifically , neither can their debunkers disprove them , said evangelical scholar Scot McKnight , associate professor of New Testament at Trinity College in Deerfield , Ill . <p> " If you operate from the standpoint we use in the United States that a text is innocent until proven guilty , " he says , " there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used by both sides to reach different conclusions - the harmony between the accounts of Jesus ' birth in the New Testament and the Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah . Those who hold orthodox views say the Gospels are a fulfillment of what was predicted . Critics say the Gospel stories were created from the prophecies to make them more convincing . <p> Since it is unlikely that either side will be able to prove its position , the bottom line is - so what ? <p> Some Christians find liberation in being able to reject the specifics of the nativity stories , Borg said . " Traditional literalism tends to turn Christianity into a religion of bondage , " he said . " It requires that I believe something that does not make sense . " <p> Others think the destruction of the faith will come by casting out what has heretofore been considered biblical truth . <p> And still others find the whole argument distracting . <p> Scholarly arguments often seem irrelevant <p> " There are many of us who are just as smart who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y , " said Luke Johnson , professor of New Testament at Emory University 's Candler School of Theology . Scholarly arguments over historical accuracy often seem irrelevant to the faith , he said . <p> " If the only thing your professors have given you is the ability to dissect the text into itty-bitty pieces , that 's like going to medical school and being taught only to perform autopsies . " <p> What Jesus stood for during his lifetime and the resurrected , living Christ in the world today are what count , said Moessner of Columbia . <p> " If I did not believe God raised Jesus from the dead - that there is life out of nothing - I would not be teaching at a theological seminary . I would not want to waste my time , " he said . " It 's not incredible to believe that the God who raised Jesus from the dead is the God who brought life to Mary 's womb . " <p> John P. Meier , a Catholic priest and professor of New Testament at Catholic U niversity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship between the historical accounts and the message of faith they are intended to convey . <p> " Christianity , unlike some religions , is connected to a historical event - the life of Jesus , " Meier said . <p> To Meier , who accepts the truth of the virgin birth , the miraculous conception , like the resurrection of Jesus , represents the life-giving power of God . <p> " Yes , " he said simply when asked whether he believes in the virgin birth . <p> " If you asked me could I prove it historically - no . I could n't prove the trinity historically . I could n't prove the Resurrection historically , " said Meier , author of the recent two-volume study of Jesus called " A Marginal Jew . " <p> " If we could prove it all , " he said , " it would be a matter of historical investigation . There would be no need to talk about faith at all . "
