Their bad reputation notwithstanding , female spiders rarely attack and devour their mates . Even in the case of the infamous black widow , if a male courts at the proper time and approaches the female with the proper caution , he will survive the encounter . The females of the species Pisaura mirabilis , however , do like to snack while they mate and will consider only a suitor bearing a large nuptial gift  --  in the form of a fat , juicy insect . The courtship ritual of this common European nursery web spider is unique among the 30,000 or so known species of spiders . Upon reaching maturity the males virtually cease eating . They turn solely to courtship , and instead of devouring the insects that they ambush , they carefully wrap the prey , clasp the silk-enshrouded corpses in their jaws , and set off in search of mates . <p> Once a male locates a female , he approaches her cautiously and tilts backward to present the prey held in his jaws . At the same time , he raises and vibrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of his jaw , which contain special sperm storage sacs ) . The female passes her own pedipalps over the insect , as if measuring its size with calipers . She will summarily reject males bearing very small nuptial gifts and simply walk away . If the gift is acceptably large , the female bites into it and begins feeding , but she may walk away to eat it elsewhere , dragging the hapless male beneath her . <p> Once she is occupied with her meal , the male gingerly releases his grip on the prey and swivels underneath the female to insert a pedipalp into one of two openings in her abdomen . After mating for about an hour , he swivels back to his original position , briefly bites the prey , then pivots in the opposite direction to fertilize the female 's second genital opening with his other pedipalp  --  a process that takes another hour . The male bites into the prey one last time  --  an act that often precipitates a furious struggle for its possession . If he succeeds in wresting it from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The quality and quantity of silk that the male produces are pivotal to the outcome of these sexual encounters . A nuptial gift can be made larger and more enticing if wound in many layers of silk ; even a smallish insect becomes acceptable if suitably wrapped . This is not quite the deception that it appears , however , for spider silk is high in protein , and females consume the wrapping as eagerly as they do the gift . Furthermore , the silk is costly for the fasting male to produce because it uses up precious calories . <p> The silk serves another important function : during copulation , the male 's only hold on the nuptial gift is a tether of silk attached to his spinnerets . Because a female will often try to make off with the gift before the male has completed transferring his sperm or sometimes without mating at all , the strength of the silk line is vital in holding on to the insect  --  and his mate .

But the female benefits from the nuptial gift in several other ways . Its size undoubtedly has a bearing on how many eggs she can lay . ( We have found that P. mirabilis fed one housefly per day produce nearly twice as many eggs as those given one fly every three days . ) And since the nuptial gift is one of the last meals a female will have , its size also determines whether she will survive long enough to protect her offspring until they molt and disperse to hunt on their own . After laying her eggs , she will not eat again . The single batch of eggs is her lifetime reproductive effort , and her devotion to protecting the egg sac is total  --  leaving no time for hunting . For several weeks , she carries the egg sac in her jaws and immures herself within a silken cocoon , leaving only to warm her eggs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she constructs a tentlike nursery web , suspends the egg sac inside it , and guards it with her life . This care is essential ; when we removed some females from their guard duty , spiders of other species quickly moved in and devoured the young . <p> Parasitic ichneumonid wasps are another threat . They can pierce the spider 's egg sac and place a single egg of their own inside . The egg quickly hatches , and the wasp larva eats all the spider eggs before pupating , leaving the unknowing female spider fiercely guarding a young wasp . The rate of this parasitism rises from zero to more than 40 percent of the egg sacs as the summer progresses . Mating early in the season is therefore vital . But so are a few good meals . Well-fed females tend to produce eggs earlier and the eggs develop several weeks faster , reducing the likelihood that the clutch will fall prey to wasps . <p> PHOTO : Grasping a katydid in his jaws , a male nursery web spider prepares to wrap his catch . <p> PHOTOS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands of silk from his spinnerets .
