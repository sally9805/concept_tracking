Electronic almanacs in the palm of your hand . // I WAS RUNNING OUT THE DOOR TO catch my plane to Los Angeles on my way to use the venerable 60-inch telescope at historic Mount Wilson Observatory . Being too busy packing and making other arrangements , I never found the time to plan my observing time . Luckily , I carried aboard my personal digital assistant ( PDA ) , a pocketsize computer that is typically used as an address book , appointment calendar , and organizer . While we were cruising at 30,000 feet , I pulled it out , turned it on , and up came a star chart for me to outline my observing . I breathed a sigh of relief . There is no doubt that computers have profoundly affected the world of astronomy for amateurs and professionals alike . New hand-held computing technology has enabled yet another revolution . This time the breakthrough is true portability . The amateur astronomer can now predict celestial events and run computer simulations without either a desktop or notebook computer . PDAs weigh in at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket , and boast powerful processors and operating systems . Once again the computer is poised to assist viewing of the heavens - anytime or anywhere . Even at 30,000 feet , or even in orbit . One of the most popular of these new hand-held computers is the Pilot from 3Com Corp . There are several models available , the most advanced of which is called the Palm III , which sports a 16megahertz 68325 Dragonball processor and supports up to 12 megabytes of RAM . It also features a 160-by-160-pixel backlit LCD screen , floating-point-decimal calculations ( vital for astronomy programs ) and an infrared transceiver for sharing data with other Pilot users . There is even support for networking ( TCP/IP ) , e-mail , and Web browsing on its four-shade monochrome screen . The Palm III runs a special operating system called PalmOS , which is a powerful and flexible system that is surprisingly easy to write applications for . In fact , much of the software you will find for the Pilot ( astronomical or otherwise ) has been written by amateurs and is widely available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found inputting information into the Palm III unexpectedly easy and intuitive . The Pilot comes with a pencil-like stylus used for writing on the screen and clicking on icons . The computer recognizes handwriting written in a shorthand called Graffiti , which uses simple strokes to represent alphanumeric characters . Although it may sound difficult in concept , Graffiti took me all of five minutes to learn and an hour to master ! Even better , I have found that this method of writing results in nearly perfect recognition by the Pilot - very impressive by any standard , and especially so given my lessthan-stellar standard handwriting . Nevertheless , writing is n't required for many astronomical applications - just click the on-screen buttons . Photograph Personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) provide computing power in the palm of your hand . // Installing software onto the Pilot is incredibly simple . Information can be uploaded or downloaded by slipping the Pilot into a cradle connected to your desktop computer running Windows 95 or MacOS . Hit a button and everything on your Pilot is backed up onto your local computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilot loses battery power , gets stolen , or breaks , all your data remains safely copied onto your desktop machine . You can also add entries to the built-in programs using the desktop software . Most of the astronomy programs for the Pilot require a freeware software module called MathLib . It works with PalmOS version 2.0 or higher to provide various trigonometric and logarithmic functions . Another often-required resource is CASLrt , the module for the Compact Application Solution Language , which allows writing programs for the Pilot that are nearly as fast as those written in native code . CASLrt and MathLib can both be downloaded from the Internet . A number of my favorite Palm III astronomy programs were created by Marvin E. Wilborne III and include such titles as J-Moons ! , Sun ! , Sol ! , and Moon ! His J-Moons ! ( $5 shareware ) graphically displays the configuration of Jupiter 's Galilean satellites for any date and time . It even allows you to invert the field to better match the view through an astronomical telescope . J-Moons ! also lets you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals and is handy for searching for satellite eclipses and occultations . The orbital calculations take about two seconds for each iteration . Sun ! ( $5 shareware ) provides a wealth of information about sunrise , sunset , length of day , and more . Once I input my latitude , longitude , and Universal Time offset , my hand-held computer also displays the beginning , end , and length of civil , nautical , and astronomical twilight , as well as the Sun 's distance , angular diameter , ecliptic longitude , and right ascension and declination for any date and time specified . Sun ! even displays a compass on the screen so that aiming your Pilot toward the Sun ( or a shadow by changing the direction 180 ) reveals where north , south , east , and west are . A similar program called Moon ! ( $10 shareware ) calculates the Moon 's rise , set , and transit times , as well as local parallax and lunar distance . Sol ! ( $4.95 shareware ) is a faster version of Sun ! optimized for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are an avid Moon-gazer , you should also try two other lunar programs for the Palm III . Moon ( $5 shareware ) by Alex Garza displays a calendar on the screen with the phase of the Moon in each square of the calendar . Clicking on a date displays a box with the percent phase , Julian day , number of days into and left in the year , and the time into the current lunar cycle . Moon Phase ( freeware ) by Steven Kienle offers a large image of the current phase of the Moon , a display of the Moon 's age in days , and a table of the dates of quarter , new , and full phases for the current month . It also has an option to invert the Moon display for the Southern Hemisphere . Another interesting application for accurately computed lunar data is scheduling certain religious holidays and events based on the lunar calendar . One such astronomy program is Zman ! ( $14.95 shareware ) , which is designed to inform Jews of the proper calendar dates and times for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the most advanced astronomy software I have found for the Palm III is called Star Pilot ( $30 shareware ) from Star Pilot Technologies . This program generates star charts for any place on Earth for the past , present , or future . You can control the stellar limiting magnitude , toggle planets and stars , search by star or constellation names , and even display constellation lines . The registered version comes with the search features and a more extensive star database . Although slow by conventional desktop standards , what Star Pilot and the other Palm III applications lack in speed they make up for in portability // Star Pilot 's searchable mini star atlas offers the basics . Enter your location , select and center an observing target , then call up some details . // A series of Pilot programs by Marvin E. Wilborne III offer a variety of celestial information , including the positions of Jupiter 's Galilean satellites and almanac data for the Sun and Moon . // Although I 'm most familiar with the capabilities of the Palm III , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on other types of hand-held computers such as the Newton MessagePad ( now discontinued ) , the Psion 5 , and various computers that use Microsoft 's Windows CE operating system . Many of these machines are capable of stellar navigation , navigation with road-map displays ( using a Global Positioning System receiver ) , and more . These programs just scratch the surface of what is possible with hand-held computers . As PDAs catch up with the speeds and capabilities of current laptops and desktop machines , we can expect to see many more astronomy applications . It may not be too long before you can use a PDA to control your telescope and predict flyovers of Earth-orbiting satellites . PDAs put astronomical computing literally into our shirt pockets and offer assistance whenever and wherever we may look at the heavens . // AstroPilot by SanSoft is another PalmOS program providing handy astronomical data .
