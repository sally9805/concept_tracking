Capella is a superlative star , being the sixth brightest star in the night sky . It 's also northernmost of the 25 brightest stars visible from Earth . This northerly position means that observers in the United States can see Capella nearly year-round . Whereas most bright stars are at their best during only one or two seasons , Capella lights the early evening sky from September through June . Capella 's brilliance and position attract observers , but so does its color . Capella is a yellow star with a spectral type of G , just like the Sun , and is the only bright G-type star in the night sky visible from most of North America . Despite the similarity in color , Capella actually differs greatly from the Sun , for Capella is a giant star several times larger than the Sun . Because of its size , it radiates over 100 times more light into space than the Sun does . If we viewed the lesser light of the Sun from the 43 light-year distance of Capella , we would n't see much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely visible to the naked eye . Giant stars like Capella are in a more advanced stage of their life cycle , or evolution , than the Sun , so they provide a window on the future life of Sun-like stars . Giants have evolved from stars born with less than eight times the Sun 's mass , stars that constitute the vast majority of the Milky Way Galaxy . ( The few stars born with more than eight Suns become supergiants rather than giants and eventually explode as supernovae as they die . ) Gianthood therefore represents the future of many stars , including Sirius , Procyon , Vega , Alpha Centauri , and the Sun . But because the giant stage is a short phase of a star 's life , giants are rare . They account for less than one percent of all stars in the Galaxy . For example , more than a thousand stars lie within 43 light-years of the Sun . Yet only three in this region are giants  --  Arcturus in Bootes ( 34 light-years from the Sun ) , Pollux in Gemini ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43 light-years from the Sun ) . Because of their proximity , these giants give us a ringside seat for viewing the advanced stages of a star 's life . Capella is of particular interest because astronomers in recent years have made precise observations that pin down Capella 's exact state of evolution . And Capella is especially useful for another reason : It 's a double star . Unlike other nearby giants , Capella actually consists of two giant stars that revolve around each other . Because each star feels the other 's gravity , astronomers can determine the mass of both stars . Learning their mass is an important step in understanding these stars because mass is the key determinant of a star 's life , evolution , and eventual death . Capella 's two stars lie so close together that no ordinary telescope has ever split the pair . Nevertheless , astronomers first discovered the star 's double nature nearly a century ago . Astronomers at Lick Observatory in California were recording spectra of stars in order to determine their velocities toward or away from Earth . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compressed and dark lines in its spectrum shift to shorter , or bluer , wavelengths . If a star moves away from us , its light waves get stretched and the spectral lines shift to longer , or redder , wavelengths . In August 1899 , after recording several spectra of Capella , Lick astronomer William Campbell noticed that these spectral shifts varied from night to night , which indicated that the star 's velocity was changing . Campbell correctly concluded that another star was tugging on the main one . A few spectral lines from this second star even appeared in the spectra , confirming that Capella was indeed a double star . The spectral shifts repeat every 104 days , so the two stars revolve around each other this often . As astronomers now know , both stars are of spectral type G but they have slightly different temperatures . The warmer ( type G1 ) has a temperature of 5700 kelvins , and the cooler ( type G9 ) has a temperature of 4900 K. For comparison , the Sun ( a type G2 ) has a temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each emits much more light than the Sun does . The G1 star emits about 75 times more light than the Sun , and the G9 star emits slightly less , about G5 suns . Both stars also have similar masses , with the cooler , G9 star being slightly more massive . Astronomers deduce the similarity in mass from the orbital velocities of the stars . Consider Earth and the Moon : The Moon moves quickly in its orbit but Earth moves little in response because it is far more massive . In the case of Capella , the spectral shifts reveal that both stars move in their orbits at similar speeds , indicating that they have similar masses . Knowing the ratio of the masses , however , does not reveal just how much mass each star has . In order to determine that , astronomers must also know the separation of the two stars . The greater the separation , the greater the masses of the stars ; that is the farther apart they are , the more mass they must contain in order to whip around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two stars lie so close together , measuring their separation was a challenge for a long time . But in 1919 , astronomers at Mount Wilson Observatory in California observed Capella through an interferometer . This instrument studies the light waves arriving from each star . Two mirrors can slide along the beam of the interferometer , producing different separations between the mirrors . At certain separations , a light wave from one star arrives in sync with a light wave from the other star and adds to it , producing a large amount of light . At other places , the light waves from the two stars cancel each other and produce darkness . These alternating patterns of light and dark depend in part on how far one star is from the other and , therefore , reveal the stars ' separation . According to this work , the two stars are about 110 million kilometers ( 70 million miles ) apart , as far as Venus is from the Sun . This distance , plus the velocities and orbital period , implies that the warm ( G1 star has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star has 2.7 solar masses . During the 1990s astronomers have exploited this technique further , refining the stars ' separation and also finding their diameters . They find that the G1 star is nine times the Sun 's size and the G9 star is 12 times larger than the Sun . Tagging beside the two yellow giants is a companion star . It , like Capella , is a double star , but one containing a pair of faint , red dwarfs . Together , the two stars generate only one percent of the energy of the Sun . They lie quite far from their brighter siblings ( at least 0.15 light-year or about 1.4 trillion kilometers ) . But astronomers suspect the red stars are linked to the yellow ones because the stars have similar distances from Earth and similar motions through space . If so , Capella is really a quadruple system , consisting of four separate stars  --  two big and bright ones , and two small and faint ones . The two red dwarfs are at the beginning of the main sequence phase of their life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the yellow giants of Capella are moving through a quickly changing part of their life cycles as they near their ends . The new data on these stars have helped astronomers pin down just where these stars are in their evolution . Both stars were once on the main sequence , as the Sun now is , fusing hydrogen into helium at their cores . Because the stars are more massive than the Sun , they were hotter and bluer . In fact , while on the main sequence , both stars probably resembled the blue-white B-type star Regulus in the constellation Leo . After a star exhausts the hydrogen at its core , it leaves the main sequence . The core is now full of helium , so the star begins to burn hydrogen in a layer surrounding the core in order to provide the energy the star radiates away at its surface . The new source of energy causes the star to expand and cool , making a star like Capella turn white and then yellow . As the star expands and cools further , it brightens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core contracts and gets so hot that the helium in it begins to burn , fusing into carbon and oxygen . The rapid onset of helium burning causes an abrupt change in the star 's brightness and color . The star 's core expands , but its energy output drops . This causes the outer layers to simultaneously shrink and heat up . So the star becomes yellow again , and also smaller and fainter than it had been when it was an orange giant . Where do the stars of Capella fit into this evolutionary sequence ? Astronomers agree that the less massive star  --  that is , the warm G1 star  --  is in an early phase of giant evolution , having just left the main sequence . It is burning hydrogen in a layer surrounding its core and has not yet started to burn helium . More uncertain is the status of the cooler G9 star , which has slightly more mass than its mate . Since a more massive star evolves faster , it must be in a more evolved state . The question for astronomers is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time , so that like the other star it is burning only hydrogen ? Or has the star already gone through the orange giant phase and begun to burn helium ? Recent observations suggest that the second possibility is the truth . The G1 star helps astronomers decide , because it formed when the more massive G9 star did and so it must be the same age . Models of stellar evolution imply that the only way the G9 star can be burning hydrogen is if this star is younger than its mate . Because both stars have equal ages , the models indicate the cool G9 star must have evolved to the point where it ignited its helium . In 1991 Danish astronomer Johannes Andersen and his colleagues argued this case . Andersen 's team noted that the orbits of the two Capella giants around each other are circular , whereas most binaries with similar periods have highly elliptical orbits . This suggests that Capella 's orbit was once elliptical but has become circular . Such circularizing of the orbit results from the gravitational force that each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends in part on how close one star is to the other . The closer the stars are , the faster their orbits become circular . Although ordinary telescopes can not split the pair , the stars of Capella are nevertheless 110 million kilometers apart . This is so far that circularization would take longer than the Galaxy is old , if the stars were always as they are now . But the rate of circularization also depends on the size of the stars : The bigger they are , the faster the rate . In fact , the circularization rate varies as the eighth power of the star 's diameter ; that is , it goes 256 times faster for a star twice as large as another . If the cooler star of Capella had once been an orange giant several times larger than it is now , then in only a few million years the original elliptical orbit would have transformed into the circular one that astronomers see today . Thus , the star now must be in a later stage of evolution , burning helium in its core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an advanced evolutionary stage of the G9 star . Catherine Pilachowski of Kitt Peak National Observatory in Tucson , Arizona , and lames Sowell of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta measured the amount of lithium in the two Capella giants . Lithium provides a probe of a star 's evolution because the element is fragile and burns up at even modest temperatures . Lithium can survive at a star 's surface , which is relatively cool , but gets destroyed if it is dragged into the star 's hot interior . When a yellow giant expands into an orange giant prior to helium ignition , the surface layers of the star get churned up and pulled inside , where the lithium is destroyed . Pilachowski and Sowell found that the warmer G1 star has a normal amount of lithium , similar to the amount it was probably born with . This confirms that the star has only recently become a giant . But the cooler G9 star has 160 times less lithium than its mate . This suggests that the G9 star was once a larger orange giant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , the star is a hotter but smaller object that burns helium at its core . Models of stellar evolution predict the future of the helium-burning G9 star . As the star consumes is helium , its core fills with carbon and oxygen . When no more helium remains in the core , the star burns helium in a layer surrounding the core . Soon , hydrogen reignites in a shell outside the helium-burning layer , so that the star burns both hydrogen and helium . During this stage , the giant again expands , making its surface cooler , redder , and brighter . The star first becomes an orange giant and then a red giant . At some point the star kicks off its outer atmosphere , exposing its hot carbon-oxygen core and forming a planetary nebula around itself . Once a mighty giant , the star is on its way to becoming a humble white dwarf the size of Earth . The models of Capella 's evolution also yield an estimate of the system 's present age , because the rate of evolution depends on the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the temperatures , luminosities , and states of evolution of the stars , they can calculate Capella 's age , which comes out to about 600 million years . That is an interesting number because it is also the age of the Hyades , the nearest star cluster to Earth . The Hyades are 150 light-years away and form the face of the Bull in Taurus , which lies next to Capella 's home of Auriga . Furthermore , the motion of Capella through space matches that of the Hyades . Perhaps Capella once belonged to the Hyades and got kicked out . Or perhaps , 600 million years ago , a huge cloud of gas and dust in our part of the Galaxy gave birth to a horde of new stars , including the Hyades and Capella . Capella gives astronomers great insight into the nature of giants , stars that are rare but represent a common phase of stellar evolution . Indeed , many o the bright stars in the night sky will someday become giants . One of the first will probably be the blue main-sequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Sun and so is more massive than the stars of Capella . Regulus will enter the giant stage in less than 100 million years . Following Regulus into gianthood will be bright , white , A-type main-sequence stars that speckle the night sky , stars such as Sirius , Vega , Altair , and Fomalhaut . Each of these will , in its turn , run out of hydrogen in its core , expand into a giant , and shine forth even more brightly . The same fate also awaits our Sun . Billions of years from now , after all those other stars have died , the Sun will exhaust the hydrogen at its core . It will expand , cool , and turn orange and then red , shining with Car greater intensity than it ever has before . At that future date , perhaps the Sun , as Capella does now , will attract astronomers who seek to fully understand the advanced stages in the lives of the Galaxy 's stars .
