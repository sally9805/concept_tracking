It 's happened to all of you . You 're in the car , headed who knows where , and you come to this town that is n't happy being just another place , because what does that mean today ? It means you 've got a Dunkin ' Donuts and a Taco Bell , like every other place in America . Big deal . <P> A town needs an identity , or it does n't exist . Something nobody else can claim . <P> Welcome to the Carpet Capital of the World ! <P> Yeah , so it 's just rugs . But now they 're on the map . <P> And do n't say you have n't stumbled upon one of those places in the minivan , children strapped in behind you in those church pews  --  or maybe in a roadster , top down , the wind laughing through the sparse seedlings of your new plug-a-rug  --  and wondered how a nowhere burg like Dalton , Ga. , comes to carpet the planet . Or how a look-fast town , a highway blur , becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Storm-Watching Capital ( Bandon , Ore. ) of the universe ( or so they claim ) . <P> And what 's it like to live , work and play in one of those dozens of places that dress up billboards , fly flags and erect monuments and museums to a product or an idea ? You 've come to the right place , because we have all the answers , centered , as we are , in the news and information capital of the world . We have sat on porches and in parlors , toured factories and roamed Main Streets . We will now take you to the fireworks capital of the entire galaxy  --  or at least of Pennsylvania  --  and whisk you into the clouds to meet the too-young millionaires in sandals and cutoffs who populate the top of a Dallas skyscraper ( bloody video-game capital of the world ) . <P> As different as these worlds are , they are a part of the same thing . The secret capitals of America . <P> The making and remaking of identities . Enterprise . Pride . Work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in northern Alabama , drive into the center square in the little town of Albertville , and you 'll know the full passion of American industriousness and hometown pride . There , perched nobly atop a sleek granite platform and gleaming under a stubborn sun that hogs the sky , is a nickel-plated fire hydrant . <P> Albertville is the fire-hydrant capital of the world . What , you thought they just sprouted out of the ground ? Somebody has to make them , and in Albertville ( pop . 17,145 ) even dogs know what puts food in the bowl . They leave the town monument alone , despite the urge . <P> When the whistle blows at 3 o'clock in the hydrant factory , a redhead named Opie races away in a pickup and begins a second back-breaking job to help pay for the dream house he is building on seven lakeside acres of peace and quiet . <P> In Pittsburgh , Pa. , a wild-haired doctor finishes a round of surgeries before noon , gets into a Mercedes and then motors an hour north to help his 73-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . <P> This is a story of ingenuity big and small , noble and flat out cash driven . It all began , for sure , at the very foundation of American capitalism . The lemonade stand . <P> Who among us , in our childhoods , did n't see some kid selling lemonade on a corner and plot to steal a piece of the action with a better drink , a nicer stand , a smarter gimmick ? <P> In some respects this is a story of grownup lemonade stands . <P> Of the will to work .
