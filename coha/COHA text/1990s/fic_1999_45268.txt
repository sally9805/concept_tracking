Satursay , August 12 , 194- , 11:47 P.M. <p> The story comes to the city as a newcomer , searching for a place to be born . But the story is not particular . It falls in love with the first place it sees . Once it touches down , it immediately begins to spread out-to populate itself . As it recognizes its presence , it learns its name-then realizes that it has not yet willed itself alive . Drawing first breath , the story opens its mouth : shots ring out . Sirens cut through the night . The priest gives the cop his last rites as the officer 's peaked cap washes toward the sewer grate in the johnny-pump run-off . Some ghoul snaps a picture and the flash freezes the only eyewitness , Gertie Schmerz hereinafter known as Goity Shmoitz . <p> " Goity , " says the captain , his face ashen , " what 'd you see ? " <p> Goity 's looking up beyond the glare of the city , of Rikers and Optimo Cigars , of the red and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's not looking at the cop in the gutter . She ca n't face the captain or the smashed window of the held-up liquor store . She 's looking up , past the trestle , past the baleful glow of the shepherd 's crook street lamps , past the hanging cornices . She grabs the captain by his blue serge sleeve-gold braided and too hot for this muggy night . " Jeez , Captain-didja see that ? " The captain follows her gaze . " Get a load of them , " says Goity . " They 're coming faster now-get a load of them shootin ' stars ! " <p> Sunday , August 13 , 12:35 A.M. <p> Goity wears too much perfume , thinks the captain as he walks past . Apart from that , she 's a pretty classy dame . <p> Detective Flynn hereinafter referred to as Det . Flan has trouble concentrating on anything besides Goity 's sumptuous bust , a poetic miracle even in these lousy precinct overhead globelights , hanging as they do from chains . <p> " Lemme call my ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home by now , " says Goity , who , believe it or not , is utterly unconscious of her beauty . Det . Flan picks up the heavy black bakelite phone and sets it down next to her , directly on his left thumb . " Be my guest . " <p> The phone is a classic : designed by Henry Dreyfuss when he worked for Bell Labs in Jersey , before he sculpted the gleaming stainless steel prosthetic claw-arm for the VA , and long before he designed the mobile ICBM launcher that looks like a matchbox toy in the old photos from the DOD . The phone is a classic all right ; it makes an audible clunk as Det . Flan pulls his thumb out from underneath it . Goity 's conversation with her mom is a classic too . " Did I wake ya ? Na , do n't worry , Ma-and do n't tell Papa . Sure I 'm all right . Yeah , yeah , I 'm OK . Do n't wait up now . OK . OK-wait a minute . " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ma I 'm OK will ya ? She do n't believe me . " <p> " Mrs. Shmoitz , " says Det . Flan , " your daughter is just fine . " He seizes the opportunity to wink at Goity . " She 's sitting right here at my desk at the Io9th . I 'm just asking her a few questions and then I 'm driving her straight home . Sure I got the address . Yes , Mrs. Shmoitz , she 's absolutely fine . " Built like a brick shithouse , he thinks , becoming momentarily aware of his carotid artery thrumming against his shirt collar . <p> Out on the street , there are people like Joe , the blind newspaperman on Goity 's corner , and the little boy who plays handball off her stoop , who hardly notice Goity at all . <p> 10:58 A.M. <p> No leads , so Det . Flan decides to run in some local roughnecks . Maybe Goity can make one of ' em in a lineup . That does n't pan out , so she 's spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk-thousands of ' em . <p> " Well , he was n't no Negro , I 'll tell ya that . He was n't no Perta Rican neither-and he was n't no Jap or no Chinaman . . . " <p> It is a painfully slow process of elimination , ameliorated somewhat by the outline of Goity 's jugs , attempting like a surging tide to escape the confines of her most classy chiffon bougainvillea blouse . <p> " It was n't none of these palookas , " says Goity , shutting the heavy volume of defiant , rageful , and defeat-suffused faces . " Got any more ? " Church bells from St. Bonaventure 's blow through the open windows . <p> " Sure , " says Det . Flan , " plenty . " A fly lands on the back of his neck . He swats it . It 's a yellowjacket . " Jesus , Mary , and Joseph ! " he yells , leaping up . Really he feels like hollering shit ! but he does n't want Goity to think him vulgar , particularly on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says heading for the first-aid kit mounted on the wall . Reaching for the Caladryl he notices , over his shoulder , how the rotating fan , mounted above the doorway , blows Goity 's red hair just so as she looks through the window toward the echo of the bells . <p> The young criminal has divided the loot with no accomplices . He-himself the ringleader , himself the entire gang-is cleaning his gun , holed up in a rooming house halfway down a street named for a recessive gene . <p> He parts the curtains and looks out the window at the ugly globes atop the immense Manhattan bridge . A man in a sleeveless T-shirt is walking toward the johnny-pump with a stilson wrench on his shoulder as a crowd of expectant kids gathers round . <p> That tomato wit ' the red hair that looked me in the eye when I came bustin ' out shootin'whatta tomato ! Four .32 caliber cartridges clatter to the uncarpeted floor . Sure she got a good look at me , probably even saw my scar , but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I would n't mind gettin ' to know her . He ruffles his wad , the one that came out of the cash register of O'Dwyer 's Wines &; Liquors . I 'd take her to Radio City for a double feature . Then we 'd watch ' em skate in the rink . Then I 'd take her to Schrafft 's for a banana split . She 'd like that , I 'll bet . Hell , I 'd even put on a white shirt and a tie if I had one . <p> Sunday , August I3 , I998 , I:I9 P.M. <p> " Ya got an awful lot of this wrong , " says Goity in the solarium of the nursing home . She 's cranky , but she 's allowed . And anyway , the air conditioning is losing its battle against the muggy afternoon . " Jeez , whydja want to write about all this stuff that happened before you was born ? What made ya want to write about me ? " She coughsrummages in the pockets of her robe . Finds two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doll an ' run down to the commissary an ' pick me up a pack of Pall Malls ? " <p> Sunday , August 13 , 1:22 P.M. <p> " Say kid , there 's a goil wit ' red hair up on the toid floor-I got two bits here says she 's got a name . " <p> " Yeah , you mean Goity-Goity Shmoitz . " The kid holds out a palm grimed from hours of solo handball . <p> " An ' who 's livin ' wit ' her ? " The kid looks at him like he 's a moron . <p> " Her old man and her old lady-whaddya think ? " <p> " Anyone else ? " <p> " Say , what about my two bits ? " <p> " Anyone else livin ' wit her ? " <p> " They got a dog named Frankie , a dachshund-an ' two cats . Now can I have my quarter ? " <p> Sure , kid , sure . Knock yourself out . " <p> " Thanks . " <p> " do n't tell nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The kid has just scored himself a triple feature , half a dozen jawbreakers and red licorice helix sticks-and even a pinwheel to put over his baby sister 's crib if there 's any breeze to turn it-when he gets back from Coney Island . <p> Goity , as it happens , is already at Coney Island and enjoying the fine surf today . She gets salt water in her mouth and hair , and because she 's such a strong swimmer , ventures out a little beyond the breakers where , in the calm , she practices her crawl parallel to shore . She rolls over and into a lazy backstroke . Then she spreads her limbs like a starfish , arches her back and floats . Occasionally a cool slap of wavelet breaks against her left side and right away seeps into her swimsuit like she 's the beach . The sun 's so bright , there 's fireworks when she closes her eyes . And when she sees Det . Flan , she laughs at the wasp sting on his neck coated with dried Caladryl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest and how he treated her like a lady . And when the fireworks show her the young criminal , she sees his scar , his closecropped widow 's peak and the eyes that looked through her , and open pop her eyes . She ca n't see Helen Colosi or Sadie Starkowitz who work with her at Gimbelswere working with her the night the bomber plowed into the Empire State building-what a smack ! - and were working with her on VJ day when everyone ran into the streets and some sailor grabbed her behind and yelled , " keep your motor runnin ' sugar , I 'm comin ' home ! " and she said " whaddaya mean ya moron , you are home , " and they got swept up by the surging crowd . <p> No she ca n't see Helen or Sadie , but they 're probably getting burned to a crisp and wondering if she 's drowned-if they 're not too busy flapping with some sailors back from South Pacific for whom there is nothing like a dame . But without turning her head she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lifeguard has been whistling for God knows how long because by now she 's way out and drifting further , and she 's making her way through the breakers , watching out for the undertow and trying not to get hit from behind , when she sees the small body tossing that the lifeguard missed ' cause he only had eyes for her , and she drags him onto the beach , his little trunks half falling off and as white as a flounder at Pecoraro 's and before Helen and Sadie can run up yelling Jeez , ai n't that the little kid always hanging round your stoop ? Goity 's already pumping up and down on his pale belly remembering what Popeye did to Olive in some cartoon and just like that , up comes a big stream of water and he coughs and his eyes half open and he coughs more and starts to bawl as Goity sits him up and hugs him to her strong swimmer 's bazooms and the lifeguard runs up kicking sand , yelling " gangway , gangway-give ' em some air ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M . <p> " I want the darkest whole wheat toast you got . " She holds up a slice . " Even darker , " says the young criminal . She pops the toaster back down again . The orange coils of the Proctor Silex underlight her pointed chin in an instant Hopper missed , to his everlasting detriment , before she flips the spigot of the coffee urn , then turns and sets the steaming mug down before the young criminal at the counter of any Rikers anywhere . Smoke billows from the toaster . " Now , " he says , " now . ' <p> " Light and sweet , honey ? " she asks as Det . Flan slides onto a stool nine spaces down the counter from the young criminal . <p> " Nah , Dottie , " he says , " lemme have it black . Say , Dottie , something 's burning . " <p> " It was for him , " she says , baffling her voice against the back of her hand , and rolling her hazel almond eyes-alive beneath her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young criminal munching his incinerated toast . " Takes all kinds , I guess . " <p> The young criminal drinks his coffee with cream and so much sugar you could stand a spoon up in it . Ashlike crumbs of his devoured toast speckle the robust china dish with Rikers imprinted in gray on the white institutional glazing . On the counter next to his plate lie a dime and an Indian head nickel , buffalo side up . Toast and coffee costs a dime . The nickel 's for her . Big spender , Dottie thinks as she rings up the cash register which sounds like the sleigh ride she could really use in this heat wave . So well greased is the shaft of the stool formerly occupied by the young criminal that it is only now that its spinning comes to a halt , warmth emanating from the leatherettecovered cushion-a perfect orange disk like the sun creeping over the cornices and flashing on the El tracks outside Goity 's window . <p> Goity 's alarm goes off as a train rumbles in . She bats at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the pillow . " Ow ! " And then she feels the tightness of her face and forehead and she remembers sunburn and Coney Island and the kid , Richie , who 's always on the stoop , playing handball . <p> 7:26 A.M. <p> I wonder if she saw my hand shake drinking my coffee , or if that dick made me before I took off My hand never used to shake . But I ai n't been sleepin ' . And I never shot no one before . Never had to . An ' a copper to boot . He conjures the not inappropriate image of the electric chair and feels his young cheeks sliding toward George Raft . An ' I ca n't stomach nothin ' but black toast . And then he thinks : Jeez , I got ta get this off my chest , and wonders if that priest down the block from where Goity lives would turn him in . He looks like a regular guy , but you never know . The young criminal walks toward the church and up the steps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that a pistol in his pocket , or-in the quiet of the sanctuary-is he just glad to see Goity Shmoitz as her red curls tumble from beneath her blue stained-glass shawl ? <p> " Son , you 're a day late if you came for high mass , " says the priest , laying a hand on the young criminal 's shoulder . The young criminal whirls around . <p> " Father I- I- " <p> What follows is the expected interchange during which the priest assures the young criminal that his confession will remain between himself , the Holy Father , and the stones of St. Bonaventure 's . And then comes the inevitable spilling of the beans , after which the young criminal feels his soul much lightened and Father Flanagain finds himself deeply troubled and in a bind , not least because his brother is a detective , and a man-a cop-has been murdered . Never , never has Father Flanagain 's collar felt so tight . Father Flanagain walks down the aisle to the portico to get some air where , hidden by the shadows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goity Shmoitz , negotiating a half-run in her rayon-silk skirt with the big buttons running up the front , trying to catch the El to her job at Gimbels . It 's gon na be another scorcher-I shoulda worn the seersucker-omi , god ! Father Flanagain sees them stop dead , feint to one side in unison , then to the other , then brush past-the young criminal ducking his head as if holding tight to an invisible fedora caught in a cloudburst , and Goity , her face drained of color-yesterday 's sunburn momentarily blanched . Goity does n't look back . The young criminal hurries on . Father Flanagain muses , then returns to the cavern of his church as Goity disappears up the steps vibrating with the oncoming El . The young criminal walks swiftly in the laddered shadow of the trestle rails , and the city engulfs them all . <p> 10:45 A.M. <p> Goity 's selling coitins on five-that 's her job at Gimbels . Sadie sells hats and gloves on Main and Helen sells perfume-she 's an expert-Goity always takes her advice on eau de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on break in the salesclerks ' powder room , Goity smokes her first cigarette , which is a mixed blessing because now she has something to do with her hands when she 's nervous , and can look sophisticated-maybe even sophisticated enough to get kicked downstairs to Cosmetics on Main-but in the meantime she 's feeling like she 's gon na throw up . " There-now exhale , " says Sadie , demonstrating for Goity her own perfected flared-nostril dragonstyle maneuvers . Goity makes a good faith attempt . " Now , dontcha noives feel a whole lot calmer ? " Goity coughs , nods , then shakes her head , turning green through her sunburn . <p> 11:57 A.M. <p> Fray Flanentonces : this is what his newest parishioners from the island of Puerto Rico call him . And indeed sometimes his soul feels as frayed as the hem of the hassock he unburdens himself of , and lying down in only his T-shirt and boxers , drifts into an unaccustomed , torpid siesta . He dreams that his testicles have become a pair of bells , one higher pitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an invisible hand , they at first call and respond , then begin banging together in a discordant cacophonythe little one cracking the larger , and the larger one knocking the clapper out of the little one 's mouth . But in their damaged state the bells multiply wondrously until they form an immense carillon which bursts out of his pants and rages into his eardrums . In reality , the chimes have not been ringing long . He looks at his alarm clock which informs him that it is high noon and he swiftly attains the realization that he is not Gary Cooper . <p> Five minutes later , rehassocked , he pushes open the creaking thigh-high door and enters the squad room of the 109th . Det . Flan , sleeves rolled up and wearing suspenders , leaps to his feet . " Padre ! " he cries embracing his kid brother and digging a knuckle into his ribs . " Padre-what brings your eminence down to the one-o-nine ? " <p> 3:15 P.M. <p> Goity no longer wants to throw up . In fact , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroic efforts in selling some floral valences to a biddy from Forest Hills and looks forward to the end of the workday-to strolling past the statue of Minerva and the Bell Ringers , now silent and covered with pigeons having just rung seven bells and all 's well , and to another smoke even , this time in the window of the White Tower with Sadie and Helen , and that girl from Foundations on 3 and Ethel from Macy 's coats , where a man none of them have seen before will wave to them and then take the photo that ends up in The Family of Man just after the Frenchman on the picnic blanket salting a hard-boiled egg and right before the Congolese drinking a trickle of water from a calabash . <p> For a goil comin ' into her own in the big city , it do n't get much bettern ' this , she 's thinking as a hidden form displaces the draperies , and scared as she is she runs after him and catches only a glimpse , his arm over his face as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wooden slats of the escalator going down . Now she 's got the willies bad and , there being no customers , she straightens up the draperies like her life depends on it , all the time with one eye over her shoulder wishing some biddy would get off the Up escalator to bother her and say honey , pay no attention . Pay no attention to the man behind the coitin . <p> 7:27 P.M. <p> It 's bright white in the White Tower where Goity and Helen Colosi , Sadie Stark , that girl from Foundations on 3 and Ethel from Macy 's and Vera ( I think her name is ) from Altman 's are lingering over their coffee and cigarettes and the photographer who shoots them makes sign language , points for them to turn a certain way , tilt a chin just so and then when he 's snapped , a wink and a thumbs up and he looks nothing like the man behind the curtain . <p> Tuesday , August 15 , 2:45 A . M. <p> Father Fray Flanagain dreams of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . He dreams an ailanthus tree is growing out of the belfry of St. Bonaventure 's . He awakens bathed in sweat . <p> The young criminal , sleepless as a ghost , consumes mug after mug of neon-lit coffee and himself revisits a host of places he 'd just as soon forget and reads , like the screen credits of the movies he inhabits between bouts of coffee , the scenarios he 'd pay good money to undo . Perhaps if he 'd met Father Flanagain sooner . And Goity . Maybe if they 'd all grown up together . <p> The cook , waiter , and cashier look more or less like the Three Stooges , and one rod in his pocket reminds him of Goity and the other of the cop falling like an overdressed blue serge telephone pole with double-breasted brass buttons and a peaked hat . And it 's this second rod that speaks loudest , telling him to put that cup back in the saucer in the tiny pool of overflow and lay the crust of burnt toast down on the figured industrial-strength plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Three Stooges behave more or less like the Three Stooges-Curley even slamming his hand in the now empty cash drawer and howling appropriately-but there is no comfort when you 're a Stooge and no customers neither and no casualties that wo n't heal themselves . And since this time there are no stiffs , no meat wagon , and no coroner , Det . Flan-who even looks a little like Errol Flynn in the right lighting-never so much as hears a murmur about the penny-ante stick-up at the Midway Diner on Ninth and Twenty-ninth . <p> Det . Flan , however , has his own reasons for not being tucked into bed at this unholy hour . It is his job , indeed his vocation , to be staring at eleven cats in various stages of disrepair , wending around and perching on the strangled , pungent-smelling body of their late can-opener , a widow in her fifties-no apparent motive , forced entry , or valuables missing . More flashbulbs . And then , of course , the big question is whether he 'd rather be seeing two red afterimage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hollow sockets of the near and soon-to-be corpses after his tank crashed the gate at Dachau . <p> 2:53 A.M. <p> Father Flanagain dreams of a winged horse bedeviled by flies . <p> 4:12 A.M. <p> It is still nearly two hours before dawn will break and longer still till sun glints off the curving beams of Gustav Lindenthal 's Hell Gate bridge or throws shadows of Roebling 's arches over the already bustling fish market . Othmar Amman 's George Washington Bridge shimmers in the steel of its own vibration-hardly any traffic at this hour and no Boy Scout troops breaking step to march upon the heights of wooded Fort Lee . No waiting either way down at Holland 's tunnel . A lighter bound from the Army Terminal to the railhead in Jersey crosses paths with the pilot boat of a freighter out of Rotterdam and the ferries to and from Staten Island lie safely tucked into their berths , like sleeping pigeons in a rusting-out cornice . Gulls cry and buoys clang , yes , but no one sweats out a confession in the back room of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Det . Flan , pacing up and down the sidewalk in front of Goity 's house , has nothing to interrogate but shadows . <p> 6:16 A.M. <p> It 's altogether suffocating but he does n't feel like waiting anywhere else except on the platform where the buses come and go . The Greyhound for Kansas City has been idling there for what seems like an hour before the driver in his gray peaked hat and a corncob pipe like " Foxhole " Doug MacArthur swings open the door , saunters down the steps and opens the luggage bay . " Foxhole " Doug gives the young criminal the once-over : no suitcase and goin ' to Kansas City , eh ? he thinks and walks around to check the rear tires . By the time he returns to the front again , the young criminal 's already on board , sitting midway down the left row , chair tilted back and sleeping like a baby-his ticket propped up in his half-opened hand . " Foxhole " Doug pushes the brim of his peaked hat up on his forehead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket , tears it along the perforation and replaces the stub in the kid 's half-opened hand . The young criminal does n't stir . He wo n't wake up till Indiana where he 'll have to take a leak real bad . <p> 8:15 A.M. <p> Choich bells are ringin ' . Her mom is dissolving in tears and even Papa looks like a misty Teddy Roosevelt climbed down off of Mt . Rushmore . When she throws her bouquet , Sadie and Helen grab for it , but the goil from Foundations on 3 turns out to be next to get hitched . And as Father Flanagain beams , she finally gets to take a good look-though he 's already threaded on the gold ring and kissed her-at her new husband , the man she 's bound to for richer or poorer , in sickness , in health , for as long as they both shall live . And it 's him ! - the guy who shot the cop , the man behind the coitin , and even though he 's throwing rice with the rest of ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his eyes kind of flash , like Custer when he sees how bad the traders have been robbin ' the Indians . " Oh jeez Mom-it 's eight-fifteen for cryin ' out loud , why dintja wake me ? I 'm gon na get fired for sure ! " <p> But her mother did n't wake her because Goity looked so tired when she came home last night and she figured she needed her beauty sleep and would call in sick in the morning and Goity does n't get fired even though she 's fourteen minutes late-late enough for Gertrude Schaller , whom nobody calls Goity , to tug at her bun and tell Goity she almost reconsidered promoting her to Cosmetics on Main because of her tardiness , but she 's going to give her the benefit of the doubt since she looks so sophisticated lately even though she 's sixteen minutes late and her seersucker skirt 's on backward-now go powder your nose young lady and do n't thank me . <p> 9:03 A.M. <p> School is boring and he 's not half as good at it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day feeling lousy . But today , uh-unh-no one 's gettin ' him into that classroom on a sunny day like today-and even though he always goes alone , he likes it better that way , likes to stand all the way at the front of the train , not being crowded by no one , with the chains jangling-especially when it 's an El but even when it plunges deep into a tunnel-especially when it 's going to Coney Island . And though he 'll catch hell-that was Father Flanagain 's voice at his back bounding up the stairway : " young man and just where do you think you 're going ? " - he still has two bits in his pocket and a whole day ahead of him like an open field of ocean and sand and he will change into his swim trunks in the moving shadows beneath the boardwalk , leaving his clothes in the damp by a piling and afterward dry off stretched on the beach and before sneaking under the turnstile and heading home , he 'll buy a pinwheel for baby sister and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now you might think : this is a heck of a place to quit-I was just getting going . But I got ta tell you-whatever happens-between you and me , this story 's not over . Not for Goity , not for the young criminal , not for Det . Flan nor Padre Flanagain , nor Helen Colosi , Sadie Stark , the girl from Foundations on 3 , nor the guy who snapped their picture at White Tower-nor Richie , the kid whose baby sister is lying in her crib , staring at the pinwheel spinning like a turbine in the breeze of the broken heatwave . <p> It 's 2:23 P. M. eastern standard , daylight savings time , Ides of August 1998 , and it 's not over , this story ; not yet . <p>
