<p> TWO issues charge the air in this tense city : widespread concern for personal safety and how a responsive , civic environment can be forged in a city that increasingly acts and sounds like a war zone . <p> " Post-riot L.A. is a place now where a lot of 15-year-olds do n't think they are going to live to 16 , " says a staff member of an antigang organization in the city . There were 800 gang-related homicides in the city last year . <p> Los Angeles is also a county where several members of the board of supervisors use heavily armored cars , some driven by armed drivers . <p> " We did n't get to this point overnight and we 're not going to move away from this overnight , " says Los Angeles police Lt. John Duncan about safety in the city . " But once the city gets past these trials " - referring to the civil trial of police officers in the Rodney King incident and the trial of trucker Reginald Denny 's assailants - " then maybe we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No time to lose <p> What needs to be done in Los Angeles can not wait , according to many of the 21 candidates in the mayoral race . Mayor Tom Bradley is retiring after 20 years in office . The city 's long-range problems are the same as in the rest of California : how to revive a sagging economy , create more jobs , and unravel the knot of social problems that leads to crime and fear . <p> " What is wrong with L.A. , " says mayoral candidate Richard Riordan , " is that we are atomized . We do n't know our neighbors , and we need to help each other make our communities safe and clean . " <p> Another candidate , Julian Nava , proposes an urban civil corps of 8,000 to patrol streets in armed pairs as a supplement to the police . " The patrol would give residents the feeling of security and meet our immediate needs as well as long-range image restoration , " Mr. Nava says . <p> Rebuild L.A. , the organization started just after the riots last April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglected areas " in Los Angeles County with a poverty level of 20 percent or more of the population . <p> Within some of these areas Mayor Bradley started a Neighbor to Neighbor program this January to empower neighborhoods to act together for change . " We want to leave a foundation in a community , " says Marcello Howell , a special counselor to the mayor and director of the Neighbor to Neighbor program , " so that people know how to organize with real clout to get things done . If the neighbors want to get rid of the guy selling dope on the corner , or solve a housing problem , they 'll mobilize to do it . " <p> The program has hired and trained 23 organizers who , in turn , train hundreds of community people and volunteers in leadership and mediation . Some of the volunteers have gone door-to-door conducting surveys to determine the high-priority neighborhood issues . Another part of the program is the involvement of 700 at-risk students from 14 high schools in after-school activities , including training in leadership and mediation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and includes summer employment for teenagers . <p> " We also hold neighborhood forums , " Mr. Howell says , " to break down cultural barriers and get people talking to each other . " <p> On April 4 , local television station KABC will televise a three-hour community town-hall gathering put together by the Neighbor to Neighbor program . Twenty billboards sponsored by the program have been placed throughout the city to promote racial harmony . The billboards depict huge hands of all colors clasped in harmony . <p> The Neighbor to Neighbor program may serve another purpose : to help deter future rioting , no matter what verdicts are handed down in the trial of the L.A. police officers and Mr. Denny 's alleged attackers . <p> " We want people to know how they can mobilize peacefully , how they can voice their displeasure in a pro-active way , " Howell says . <p> As a result of the riots , the Los Angeles Police Department has initiated community advisory councils that meet with area commanders to discuss and solve community problems . " We 've also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in specifically dealing with large crowds during civil disorders , " says Lieutenant Duncan . " Before , we had only a general plan to fit all occurrences , including earthquakes and floods . " Few foot patrols <p> Lack of resources and the size of the city have prevented police Chief Willie Williams from putting a large number of officers on foot patrols . " Community policing has been a little hamstrung , " Duncan says . " We have around 7,700 policemen , and about 425 square miles to cover . Our first priority is responding to calls for service . People want the police to respond , and every time we assign police to the special units or the streets , that 's one less person answering radio calls . " <p> Violence in Los Angeles schools , the nation 's second-largest school system , has been occurring more and more often . Two recent fatal shootings of students at Fairfax and Reseda High Schools led to a $ 1.7 million expenditure for hand-held metal detectors to be used at all schools . <p> Previously the Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of concerns about creating a police-state environment . Educators also doubted that detectors would stop the flow of guns . In January the board adopted a policy of automatic expulsion for any student coming to school with a gun . Many parents want more security guards or undercover agents at schools to protect their children . <p> Violence has become so commonplace on school grounds that each school in the Los Angeles Unified School District has its own " crisis team . " At each school , teachers , nurses , psychologists , counselors , and administrators are ready to provide help at a moment 's notice . Another 30-to-40 school psychologists are ready to go to anywhere there is an emotional crisis . <p> State Attorney General Dan Lungren has recently proposed that every school in the state create an anticrime plan , and all prospective teachers must take a course in school safety . He said schools should be " islands of safety " with " gun-free " zones surrounding school campuses . Antigun curriculum <p> Last month , following a visit by former White House press secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antigun curriculum to be taught in 20 elementary schools . Developed by the Center for the Prevention of Handgun Violence , the program helps children learn the difference between TV violence and the real thing , how to be safe in the presence of a gun , and how to resist pressure to play with or carry a gun . <p> Severe education-budget cutbacks have limited school programs in Los Angeles for the last decade . " What is happening in L.A. schools , " says Mike Davis , a writer on Los Angeles issues and a teacher at the Southern California Institute of Architecture , " is that the opportunities and resources are being reduced . <p> " We are disinvesting in our schools . We spend over $ 20,000 a year to incarcerate someone , and only $ 4,000 a year on a kid in school . The opportunities that I had as a kid have virtually disappeared in L.A. "
