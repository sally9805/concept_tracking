Out there on surgery 's cutting edge , as it were , everyone is potentially Dr. Victor Frankenstein , M.D. For , as the movies nearly always have it , there comes a time in every eminent croaker 's career when chimpanzees just wo n't do experimentally and the advancement of science requires a little ( strictly idealistic ) body snatching . <P> In Extreme Measures , the bodies are still warm and kicking . Also writhing and babbling , at least in the case of one victim who escapes from his medical abductors and turns up in a New York City trauma room presided over by Dr. Guy Luthan ( Hugh Grant ) . There the poor fellow sets all the diagnostic dials to spinning inexplicably . Not to mention Luthan 's highly ethical brain . For the man dies in mysteriously untreatable agony , and then his body disappears before a proper autopsy can be performed . Investigating , Luthan soon finds himself conspired against  --  with his job , a fellowship , life itself all placed in fairly suspenseful , smartly realized jeopardy by director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , however , who the source of his troubles is . The minute Gene Hackman appears as world-class physician Lawrence Myrick , oozing menacing bonhomie , a quality this splendid actor has virtually patented , we have our suspicions . It 's the extent and passion of the conspiracy he has mounted to protect his research that is surprising and scary . That air of earnest befuddlement Grant has deployed to such good comic effect in the past serves him  --  and us  --  very well in this very different context . He 's willowy and vulnerable in a way we no longer expect to find in action-movie protagonists , and for this film his affect is the great redeeming virtue . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
