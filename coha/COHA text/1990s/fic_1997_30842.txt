... Mo had bound the package to the roof of the car by lacing what looked like clothesline through the windows . He changed lanes and the lumpy object swung side to side under the ropes . " He do n't watch out , he 's gon na lose that sucker , " Lula said . She beeped her horn at him . " Pull over , Peckernose ! " She gave the Firebird some gas and tapped Mo 's rear bumper . I was braced against the dash , and began chanting under my breath . Holy Mary , mother of God . . . please do n't let me die on Route 1 with my hair looking like this . Lula gave Mo 's bumper another whack . The impact snapped my head and caused Mo to fishtail out of control . He swerved in front of us , a cord snapped loose and a garbage bag whipped off and sailed over our car . Lula moved in one last time , but before she could make contact the second cord broke , another garbage bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and onto the hood of Lula 's Firebird , landing with a loud WUMP ! " EEEEEEEEEEH ! " Lula and I screamed in unison . The body bounced once on the hood , and then smacked into the windshield and stuck like a squashed bug , staring at us , mouth agape , eyes unseeing . " I got a body stuck to my windshield ! " Lula yelled . " I ca n't drive like this ! I ca n't get my wipers to work . How am I supposed to drive with a dead guy on my wipers ? " The car rocked from lane to lane ; the body vaulted off the hood , did a half flip and landed faceup at the side of the road . Lula stomped on the brake and skidded to a stop on the shoulder . We sat there for a moment , hands to our hearts , unable to talk . We turned and looked out the back window . " Dang , " Lula said . I thought that summed it up . We looked at each other and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse and cautiously inched back , staying to the shoulder , out of the traffic lane . She stopped and parked a couple feet from the body . We got out of the car and crept closer . " At least he 's got his clothes on , " Lula said . " Is it Harp ? " " That would be my guess . Hard to tell with that big hole where his nose used to be . " The drizzle had turned to a driving rain . I pushed wet hair out of my eyes and blinked at Lula . " We should call the police . " " Yeah , " Lula said . " That 's a good idea . You call the police , and I 'll cover the body . I got a blanket in the back . " I ran back to the car and retrieved my pocketbook . I rummaged around some , found my cell phone , flipped it open and punched the on button . A dim light flashed a low battery message and cut off . " No juice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the phone on last night . We 'll have to flag someone down . " A dozen cars zoomed past us , spraying water . " Plan two ? " Lula asked . " We drive to the nearest exit and call the police . " " You gon na leave the body all by itself ? " " I suppose one of us should stay . " " That would be you , " Lula said . An eighteen-wheeler roared by , almost sideswiping us . " Ditch staying , " I told her . Lula cut her eyes back to Harp . " We could take him with us . We could ram him into the trunk . And then we could drive him to a funeral parlor or something . You know , do a drop-off . " " That would be altering the scene of a crime . " " Altering , hell . This dead motherf fell out of the sky onto the hood of my car ! And anyway , he could get run over by a truck if he stays here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transit when he bounced off the Firebird . And he would n't look good with tire tracks across his chest . " Okay , " I said . " We 'll take him with us . " We looked down at Elliot . Both of us swallowing hard . " Guess you should put him in the trunk , " Lula said . " Me ? " " You do n't expect me to do it , do you ? I 'm not touching no dead man . I 've still got the creeps from Leroy Watkins . " " He 's big . I ca n't get him in the trunk by myself . " " This whole thing is giving me the runs , " Lula said . " I vote we pretend this never happened , and we get our butts out of here . " " It wo n't be so bad , " I said to her , making an effort at convincing myself . " How about your blanket ? We could wrap him in the blanket . Then we could pick him up without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all right , " Lula said . " We could give it a try . " I spread the blanket on the ground beside Elliot Harp , took a deep breath , hooked my fingers around his belt and rolled him onto the blanket . I jumped back , squeezed my eyes closed tight and exhaled . No matter how much violent death I saw , i would never get used to it . " I 'm gon na definitely have the runs , Lula said . " I can feel it coming on . " " Forget about the runs and help me with this body ! " Lula grabbed hold of the head of the blanket , and I grabbed hold of the foot end . Harp had full rigor and would n't bend , so we put him in the trunk headfirst with his legs sticking out . We carefully closed the lid on Harp 's knees and secured the lid with a piece of rope Lula had in her trunk . " Hold on , " Lula said , pulling a red flowered scarf from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a flag . " Do n't want to get a ticket . I hear the police are real picky about having things sticking out of your trunk . " Especially dead guys .
