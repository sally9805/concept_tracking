THE DAY THEY MARCHED The article , " The Day They Marched " ( Oct. 1999 ) , was the most compelling and moving article I have ever read . I was less than two months old when the march took place , and I have always wanted a clear account of what happened on that glorious day in August of 1963 . The article was written with such insight , realism , emotion and truth that it actually brought tears to my eyes . I felt the pain ; I felt the job ; I felt the need to bow down and pray , thanking God for where I am right now . I have never read a piece that actually made me feel as if I were right there , in that one moment of time where God 's children came together for a great cause for the greater good of mankind . Thank you , EBONY and Mr. Lerone Bennett Jr. , for allowing me to be there , to be a part of that powerful march for freedom , 36 years later . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of every child 's education on history , not only Black history , but American history . LAYMENTHA A. REED Churchview , Va . FUBU Thank you for your recent article , " FUBU : Young Businessmen Score With " For Us By Us " Clothing Line " ( Oct. 1999 ) . It 's inspiration to my soul to hear of our people 's tremendous success in the business circles . It 's so true what one of the FUBU founders said about being inspired to go to work . Truly , there is nothing better than finding your own niche because once it 's found , you live for it and excel in it . I sincerely hope that more Black Americans will learn from this article . It 's an excellent example of our capacity to make an impact economically and empower more of our people . TINA CRUM Chicago , Ill . FOR BROTHERS ONLY In response to your " For Brothers Only " column , " When A Sister 's Love Has A Price Tag Attached " ( Oct. 1999 ) , women do want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all truth , that 's not what men really want . Brothers are more attracted to the big hair weaves , two-ton makeup , and ultra-tight , very revealing clothes that high-maintenance women wear . They are easily spotted miles away . Well known for not having enough money to buy lunch for each day , let alone pay any of the accumulated bills for the month , these women invest only in their looks . Men willingly pay up just so that they can have these trophies on their arm for showing off , especially to other male counterparts . Meanwhile , real women only request some intimate time together and it 's like pulling teeth . Real women have jobs , pay their own bills and dress with class and decency . Our noses are not stuck way up in the air . We give our Brothers encouragement and support , not put them down or criticize them during hardships . This does not mean that we are trying to trap them into marriage , but to develop respectful and meaningful friendships , possibly companionships . Apparently some men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If these men insist on emptying their pockets on gold-digging women , it is time that they took a good and hard look at what they really want in a woman and at the women they are dating . Do n't get me wrong ; I do n't envy these women for having a " good game , " but I do n't like being categorized with them either , because I am a real woman . TONIA ALLISON Baltimore , Md . I am responding to the " For Brothers Only " article that appeared in your October issue . I am a Sister and I agree wholeheartedly with the gentleman , Kevin Chappell , who wrote it . Far too many of these female groups and singers are talking about what a man can do for them and not what they should be doing for themselves . In the beginning , I do believe that these songs were meant strictly for entertainment , but somewhere along the way they got carried away . Brothers need to realize that these songs do not represent all single women out there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't get something for nothing . " But in my Sisters " defense , we know there are a number of " good-for-nothing types of Brothers " out there ; we just have to escape or avoid those Brothers and continue to look for a good MAN . NADIA N. DAVIS Forrest City , Ark . I must applaud Kevin Chappell on " When A Sister 's Love Has A Price Tag Attached . " When I first heard those songs , I could n't believe what I was hearing . I said to myself , " Not my Sisters , too . " They have jumped on the bandwagon and have joined the rest of the media in " dogging " our Black Brothers . It illustrates to our Brothers that we ( Sisters ) have also turned our backs on them . Then we have the nerve to question their decision to date outside the race . VERONICA WADE Hollywood , Fla . WHITNEY HOUSTON I loved your article , " Whitney On Tour With New Style And New Attitude " ( Sept. 1999 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hook . It was my first time going to a concert . I am pleased that it was a Whitney one . She had so much energy and so much love for her audience , and the audience showed a lot of love for her as well . Her daughter was cute also when she came out and did her part for " My Love Is Your Love , " ( she was so cute ) . Then to top off my great evening , I got to meet the real Whitney Houston . Not through the TV screens , but actually face-to-face . She is so pretty and so nice . Most people portray her as stuck-up or selfish , but she 's nothing like that . She took time out to talk to me and my best friend , Joi Harrell , and gave us her autograph . Although she had to rush to her next-day concert in Detroit , she took about 20-30 minutes to talk to us . She gave nice embracing hugs to everyone who was with us . So all of that was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real Whitney Houston . Thanks , EBONY , for supporting and writing great articles about Whitney ; she really deserves it ! Park Forest , Ill . JANINE JONES CHANTE MOORE I would like to thank you for the article , " Chante 's Got A Man At Home And A Baby , Too " ( Sept. 1999 ) . I am glad Chante 's back ! I have been a fan of hers since the beginning of her career . She influences people . I am a young West Indian female . I love listening to her music because it deals with life , love and hope . Chante is talented and gorgeous . She deserves to have a good man at home . Chante says , " Do n't give up your search for love ; it 's worth the wait . " ( Taken from Chant , 6 's album , A Love Supreme ) . I think she 's right . I wish her happiness and success . God bless ! BUVAL CELINE Martinique , F.W.I. I enjoyed the September article on Chante Moore . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is a beautiful individual , outside as well as inside . Her inner beauty was shown when she stated : " ... you would n't raise your voice to your boss , so why would you raise your voice to your man ... " I never looked at it in that manner . When we are hurting ( for whatever reason ) , we sometimes fail to look at the " person " in the picture . I have been married to my soulmate for 29 years and this statement really gives me a new outlook on how I should " tone " down my voice when speaking to the father of my children , the love of my life , my joy in the mornings , my all in all . As my husband always says to me : " It 's okay my love to disagree , without being disagreeable . " ( I apologize darling ! ) So thank you , Chante , and I hope that your relationship will continue to flourish and blossom for many more years to come . Blessings to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Finally , after a long wait , a prominent Sister with a positive message about Brothers . Thank you , EBONY , and Chante Moore for providing us with much-needed relief While no African-American man is perfect or without flaws , I have been disturbed and saddened that after fighting the majority media for fair depictions of our race , the songs and books written by many of our own Sisters ( i.e. The Color Purple , Waiting to Exhale and TLCs " Scrubs " ) are so depressing and so full of negative stereotypical images of Brothers with no morals or scruples . Surely , some Brothers deserve the negative depictions , but , as Chante notes , we are not all bad , and there are a lot of good Brothers out here trying to do the right thing . Thanks again for providing a refreshing perspective . Keep up the good work ! MARLON PRIMES Cleveland Heights , Ohio After reading the article , " Chante s Got A Man At Home And A Baby , Too , " I felt I had to write . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her beautiful daughter and her extraordinary relationship with Kadeem of over six years . She spoke more than once about putting the Lord first in her life . However , I wonder what kind of message she thinks she 's sending to children and teenagers by having a baby and living with a man she 's not married to . If they 're so in love and have that much respect for each other , why do n't they get married ? S. A. CHAPMAN Atlanta , Ga . DRIVING WHILE BLACK As a White man married to a Black woman , I have a special perspective to share with respect to " Driving While Black " ( Sept. 1999 ) : Driving while Black and White in the same car . In 1995 , my wife and I were visiting our son and my father-in-law in Texas . I , my wife and dad were on Interstate 10 , west of Houston , when a Texas Highway Patrol cruiser passed us at high speed , then abruptly slowed to less than 40 miles per hour in front of us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't stop us , but it was obvious that he was running license plates and records on us , and his actions not only made me fear for our safety but actually endangered other motorists . It 's about time that we , as a society , crack down HARD on racial profiling . Everyone should understand that stopping or interfering with someone because of his or her race , or the race of his or her companions , is just criminal . At the very least it constitutes false imprisonment , conspiracy to violate civil rights and a hate crime-and it may also be felony assault , carjacking and kidnapping as well . It can be prosecuted under existing laws IF the courts have the resolve to do it . Racial profiling is n't likely to stop until the courts start prosecuting police for their crimes . Maybe when it is made clear to police that they will go to prison if they stop someone based on race or if they lie under oath , they will cease and desist from these illegal acts . In the meantime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of color regard them as merely another criminal element to be contended with . All too often there is a basis in fact for this . CHAD WOZNIAK Westminster , Calif . I thank you for the article , " Driving While Black , " which is one of the most informative and interesting articles I have ever read . As a young Black man , I have been stopped in Montgomery , Ala. , several times for no reason at all . Fortunately , I was not physically Continued on Next Page harassed , but I was given tickets for something I did not do . I agree with NAACP President Kweisi Mfume when he said , " Silence is our worst enemy . " I , too , think that we should protest loudly and clearly when there is a demonstrated incident . The five recommendations made by the ACLU to end " driving while Black " harassment are excellent . One of the recommendations I am beginning to follow is collection of city-to-city traffic-stop data on a voluntary basis . I thank you again for information on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will help other young Black men and women when we are caught in that situation . JARIAN D. REED Montgomery , Ala . I want to commend EBoNY and Joy Bennett Kinnon for the article , " DWB : Driving While Black . " This is such an injustice that has plagued our Black people for many years . But it seems it received little national attention until the April 9 , 1997 , devastating ordeal endured by Major Aaron Campbell Jr. , a high-ranking police official in Florida . Those of us who know , love and support Major Campbell have witnessed the toll that this ordeal has taken on him and his family . God works in mysterious ways ; it took a person of Major Campbell 's prominence to be subjected to this kind of humiliation and morally indefensible practice to trigger public awareness , resulting in recommendations and actions from the ACLU and other organizations to end racial profiling and other DWB harassment . Now there is a toll-free number for DWB complaints and a pamphlet on what to do if you are stopped . Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do hope that all of your readers cut this information out and carry it with them . NIKKI YOUNG Miami , Fla . Your recent article , " DWB : Driving While Black , " was very informative . It goes to show you that we are still being treated unfairly . There is no reason for us to be treated unfairly just because of the color of our skin or just because of the car that we drive . It 's time that we start standing up for our rights and start making a positive change for our future and for our children . DOMINIC SIMMONS Sumter , S.C . D.L. HUGHLEY I truly enjoyed the article , " D. L. Hughley : TV 's Hot New comedy Star " ( Sept. 1999 ) . He is a wonderful role model for teenagers , like me , everywhere . I find it incredible that he went from being a gang member to being a successful comedian and having a hit television show . His life proves that anything is possible when you have God on your side . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think The Hughleys is gold and will last just like The Cosby Show . RAVEN N. JAMISON Chicago , Ill . SISTERSPEAK I really enjoyed reading the " Sisterspeak " column , " 10 Things Black Women Can Do Right Now To Make Our Lives Better " ( Sept. 1999 ) . As a young , Christian and collegiate Black man , I enjoyed reading about a Black woman wanting to be independent . Too many women expect a man to " carry " them rather than " walk " with them . There 's something very attractive about a fit , intelligent , upto-date Christian woman . I hope that Black women will feel inspired by this article . A new millennium is approaching , and I hope women take the initiative to take care of their mind , body and soul . SHAWN LEWIS Montgomery , Ala . DATE WITH A DISH Numerous accolades are due the author , Ms. Charlotte Lyons , for her excellent article , " Date With A Dish : Greens , Greens And More Greens " ( Sept. 1999 ) . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her illustrative/colorful display of those edible/nutritional greens and her extensive , accompanying article . Incidentally , I have n't consumed any Swiss Chard since the Depression era , " The Dirty Thirties , " in Oklahoma , " the Sooner State . " My late mother grew and prepared this rare and savory item for our family 's occasional " culinary/cruciferous vegetables . " FRED H. CHILES Washington , D.C. Thank you for the greens recipes in September " Date With A Dish . " I have a few tips for the " Kenyan-style Collards in Lemon Sauce . " I am a Kenyan and was very excited to see this recipe . However , some tend to think that boiling the collards just tends to make the greens lose flavor and vital nutrients . It would be advisable to steam them instead . Also , the collards can be mixed with pumpkin leaves to add color and flavor . CHRISTINE KOECH Lynchburg , Va . HALLE BERRY/DOROTHY DANDRIDGE Halle Berry 's performance in Introducing Dorothy Dandridge was radiant and moving . Berry 's efforts have focused needed light on racism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actresses , preventing them from obtaining leading-lady roles . It 's evident that Black women are discriminated against and devalued , but when your own people try to lower your status , that 's especially painful and disheartening . This is why it deeply disturbed me to see Berry " publicly " degraded , dehumanized , slandered and victimized by some organizations ( not EBONY ) that practice callous and irresponsible journalism . For certain Ms. Berry 's faith is strong ; how could it not be , considering what she has been through ? Ms. Berry never forgot that God knows the truths and the untruths and what is real and imagined . It 's definitely not surprising to see Eric Benet developing a friendship with Berry because she has never given up on Black men . R. C. G. St. Louis , Mo . ERIQ LaSALLE I would like to thank you for the article , " Exclusive : " ER " Star Eriq LaSalle Tells Why He Balked At Interracial TV Love Affair " ( Aug. 1999 ) . I have never watched the television program , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive . But because of your article , I am Mr. LaSalle 's No. 1 fan . And , I definitely plan to support NBC and ER by watching the program . I have so much respect for Mr. LaSalle " stepping up " and being a " real man . " Mr. LaSalle , you set the fine example that MEN protect their communities , women and children . Thank you for being sensitive to , and respectful of , Black women ! I wish only the best to you and your fiancee . And thank you again , EBONY , for raising this Brother up for all the world to see . As we move forward into the new millennium , it does give me hope that we have Brothers like Eriq LaSalle leading the way . JUDY SMITH Riverside , Calif . In your August magazine , Eriq LaSalle spoke so eloquently about his problem with his interracial TV love affairs . As I read your article , I was very impressed and pleased that , finally , someone was speaking on behalf of the Sisters . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end I saw him with the " fairskinned woman , " as he referred to her . My whole attitude changed . I said to myself , " Here we go again ! " All these beautiful " whole Sisters " out there and the one that caught his eye was halfWhite . This is the preference of many athletes and entertainers . It makes me sick to know that we live in a society where you have a better chance of succeeding if certain physical characteristics are present . LORI WEAVER Philadelphia , Pa . GHANA 'S SUMMIT SUCCESS I , too , believe that we must strengthen the bonds of heritage and history that tie Black Americans to Africa . " Ghana 's Summit Success " ( August 1999 ) was very informative , and I thank you , Charles Whitaker , for writing this article . It 's good to see Blacks forming an organization for the advancement of Africa and African-Americans . Manv Black leaders came together at the **25;798;TOOLONG summit to involve themselves in the development of Africa . Although this is the first time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such a conference as well as to learn how I can become involved . We as Black Americans need to be aware of such an event so we can become involved . RAHEEM HAWKINS Montgomery , Ala . <p>
