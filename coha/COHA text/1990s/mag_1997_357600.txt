The grab-bag adjective new age does n't even begin to embrace it . No , this is beyond that , this display arrayed before anyone taking a stroll down the midway at the " Whole Life Expo , " the country 's largest and most successful holistic fair , which packed more than 20,000 souls into an arena in Austin , Texas , last week and is on its way to a city near you . <P> We 're talking Siberian shamanism , telepathic healing , trance dancing , past-life regression , herbalism , Tantra toning , spirit walking , aura reading , reflexology and aroma therapy . See auras , or , if you still do n't see , get a photograph of your aura with " the world 's first and only patented electromagnetic-field photographic system . " Learn about brain longevity and intuitive soul painting . Experience a magnetic sleep pad . Get an " acro-massage , " in which you balance upside down on the feet of the masseur . Have your tongue , iris and fingernails analyzed for larger body ills . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for psychotropic ethnobotany seminars that will take you into the wilds of Mexico searching for and studying hallucinogenic plants . Or , if you 're more the tentative sort , buy books . Among the subjects : UFOs , yoga , Buddhism , Christian Science , dance , meditation , prayer , death and dying , and angels . <P> In the sea of exhibits , everything is hands-on . There are massage tables everywhere , and people are always handing you a sample of wheatgrass juice or some chartreuse-colored miracle supplement that will do everything short of rotating your tires . Someone named Lissa from Montana explains how a small , stainless-steel medallion known as the BioElectric Shield ( $139 ) can be " the most powerful protection on the planet " against everything from computer screens to microwaves and cell phones . <P> How does it work ? " It 's a precision-cut quartz matrix , " she explains . Ah . <P> Three booths away , Phyllis Light , a telepathic healer with a resume that includes certification as a rebirther , Gestalt therapist , acupressurist and neurolinguistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him unstuck from where it got lodged 19 lifetimes ago . Ouch . <P> She mentions casually that she is in touch with " higher beings . " <P> All this may seem to be on the far edge , but in truth the crowd is heavy with folks wearing boat shoes and J. Crew shirts . The overflow throngs at the Austin expo are emphatically not wearing sarongs , and they do n't have full-body tattoos or multiple piercings . There is barely a dreadlock to be seen ; the average age of the expo attendee is 38 , and the average wallet is fat . After all , this is the same bunch that has caused sales of natural products to rocket from $4.2 billion in 1990 to $14 billion in 1996 , and sales of organic foods to rise from $1 billion in 1990 to $3.5 billion in 1996 . So after 15 years of staying put in San Francisco , where it was first organized by a dozen or so holistic merchants , the expo is on the move . It has shows planned for Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show . And get used to it , because expositions like this one seem destined to be a fixture of the end of the century .
