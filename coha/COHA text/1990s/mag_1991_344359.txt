" Ten thousand people , maybe more , " goes the line in The Sounds of Silence . Make that many , many more . An estimated 750,000 , in fact , equivalent to the entire population of Baltimore , all crammed into a single patch of New York City 's Central Park . PAUL SIMON was back , a decade after his first free concert there , but this time things were different . Unlike in 1981 , he did n't invite his erstwhile partner Art Garfunkel to join him . Simon , now the Midas of polycultural pop , seemed determined to banish the ghost of the folk-rock sound that made him famous . Backed by a 17-piece band , he kicked off the show ( broadcast live on HBO ) with the rousing samba tattoo of The Obvious Child , from his album The Rhythm of the Saints , and kept up the momentum with 2 1/2 hours of undulating , Afro-Caribbean-flavored music . The older songs that were included were transformed , including a reggae-tinged Bridge over Troubled Water and a percolating version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Overall : no Art , but plenty of artistry . G.G.
