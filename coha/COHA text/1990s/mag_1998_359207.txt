Picture this scene from a recent hit movie . It 's night . A car idles at a railroad crossing , waiting for the train . Inside the car are a man and a woman . She 's pregnant . She asks the man to feel her stomach  --  her baby is kicking . It 's the kind of dewy moment that would n't be out of place in a financial-services commercial , or maybe one for tires . <P> But wait . Bam ! The couple 's car is rammed from behind by some bad guys in a van . They 're trying to push the couple 's car onto the tracks . Ding , ding , ding ! The train is coming ! Screech ! The good guy accelerates , and the bad guys ' van ends up on the tracks instead . Wham ! Kapow ! Impressive fireball ! Fortunately , one of the bad guys is still alive and has time to look up and react  --  Wuh-oh !  --  just before the van is hit by a second train on parallel tracks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same movie when another bad guy had time to look up and react just before being run over by a truck . <P> Crunch ! <P> Mindless , sadistic violence juxtaposed with rote sentimentality : this is how Hollywood has finally solved the family-values conundrum , the question of how to entertain the blood- and sex-starved masses and be morally proactive at the same time . Well , dig this : Explosions are cool , and so are intact families ! That 's the message promulgated by Lethal Weapon 4 , in which the above-mentioned scene takes place . As Mel Gibson 's character comes to terms with impending fatherhood and Danny Glover 's with impending grandfatherhood , the film wends its curious way , alternating crashes and neck breakings with scenes of limp domestic comedy  --  scenes that would n't be out of place on Home Improvement , except that Tim Allen never says lines like " This fing guy ! What the f ! " <P> Lethal Weapon 4 is only the starkest example of a trend that has seen virtually every action movie released this summer freighted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the unprecedented effect of elevating teary-eyed hugs to the same level of cinematic importance as blowing up the Chrysler Building . The emotional climax of Deep Impact , for instance , occurs when Tea Leoni 's reporter character embraces her estranged dad as they stand on a windswept Atlantic beach . ( Father and daughter then find real closure when they , the Chrysler Building and the rest of the Eastern seaboard are smacked by a mile-high tidal wave . ) Armageddon , the summer 's other film in the **32;6546;TOOLONG genre , ends with Bruce Willis telling young-stud Ben Affleck to " take good care of my little girl " and then , during a stressful moment involving a nuclear weapon , having a vision of his little girl ( Liv Tyler ) in her wedding dress . The message here is : Explosions are cool , and so are sappy dads who normally hide their mushy sides behind tough-guy dialogue like " Let 's chew this iron bitch up ! " <P> Even old rogues like Zorro and Godzilla have been reinvented as family men this summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brood of babyzillas left unattended in Madison Square Garden . Lost in Space , which was released last spring , was already about a family back when it was a crummy TV show . As a crummy movie , it turns itself into a cautionary tale about bad parenting , complete with an It 's a Wonderful Life-like parallel universe in which we see what becomes of latchkey kids on other planets ( nothing good ) .
