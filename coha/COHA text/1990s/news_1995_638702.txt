<p> The television program " Inside Edition " is one of those broadcasts that mature and self-respecting adults will rarely admit to watching . In its way it is to news and information what " Baywatch " is to drama and literature . <p> To judge from a Nov. 15 broadcast in which " Inside Edition " gave viewers a wretchedly distorted view of current practices in the mining industry , the program producers should change the show 's name to something more honest , say " Insidious Edition . " <p> If the television broadcast were the only forum in which these issues were being presented falsely , it probably would n't be worth further discussion here , but in fact " Inside Edition " just happens to be the worst of a very bad lot . <p> It combines almost all of the worst aspects of television journalism . It overpromises and overdramatizes . It under-reports in the sense that it skips over important details , and lumps together unrelated issues . Finally it oversimplifies its message to the point where Tarzan and Jane might become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , the message was " mining bad , " " miners steal land , " and " miners hurt land . " <p> Intermixed with these simplistic messages and background music of " America the Beautiful " were pictures showing a variety of lovely U.S. vistas that , the report implied , the mining companies are fairly itching to destroy . <p> No where in the television report was there so much as an explanation of what is likely to happen as a result of mining legislation now before Congress , or so much as a hint of whether mining contributes anything of benefit . The uninformed viewers might well have been forgiven for believing they too could buy a gold mine worth billions for $ 100 . <p> The reality of the mining law and its implications for the nation 's future are , unfortunately , not quite so simple . <p> The contents of proposed legislation is important because at the minimum it does attempt to address the real - as distinguished from the imaginary - defects in existing mining law and answer the legitimate criticism without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like their cars , busess and bicycles to be made of metal . They like to have gold in their wedding rings , and silver in their authentic Indian jewelry . To get those things and thousands of other products does require a little mining . <p> So what are the main criticisms of the 1872 Mining Law and mining in particular , and how do mining interests respond to them ? <p> Here are some of the points gleaned from the " Inside Edition " account and other sources : <p> 1 . Mining companies are able to buy federal land at $ 5 an acre and are then free to extract minerals from it with little or no requirement that they not pollute the land . <p> This sort of claim makes as much sense as saying that the only thing you need to make a Hollywood film is a camera and the ability to smile . Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. , the chief target of the " Inside Edition " report , tried unsuccessfully to communicate with the producers and reporters and explain the way the mining law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the written information . Instead the reporters staged a filmed confrontation in New York with a company executive which it was hoped would be embarrassing . The reporter , Steve Wilson , shoved a microphone into the executive 's face and asked if he thought it was fair for his company to extract millions in minerals without " paying " for them . <p> Had Wilson been really concerned with the answer to that question he might have read part of Cyprus Amax 's statement to the audience . Among other things , that statement said the company ca n't " buy " land at $ 5 an acre and , in the real world , has to pay millions to develop mining claims . It said that the company paid $ 215 million in taxes and government fees last year , including federal and state tax , severance tax , sales and use tax , franchise tax , property tax , and federal and state royalties . Finally , it said that the company has so far invested $ 100 million in trying to perfect specific claims on Colorado land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought for less than $ 900 . <p> 2 . Mining companies do n't have to pay royalties to the government . The 1872 Mining Law was written with the obvious congressional intent to encourage development of the nation 's natural resources . It has been amended many times , but always it has been assumed that mining would employ workers , generate raw materials for manufacture , enrich the economy and produce tax revenues , all to the public 's benefit . <p> In fact , mining has done all those things . There was no provision in the law for royalties covering mining on federal lands either on net or gross receipts . Nor was there any provision for a price to be paid for the surface value of the land . <p> These concepts , however , are now embodied in legislation pending in Congress . The Republicans propose that royalties net profits only of 3 percent to 5 percent . Critics of the legislation want to impose royalties of 8 percent or more on gross receipts , a fee high enough to make sure than many mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to compare hard-rock mining with oil exploration , where royalties are in the 12 percent range , but mining for gold is n't the same as mining for oil . Where a proven oil field might produce great wealth with little additional labor or capital investment , hard-rock mining often requires years of very high labor and capital costs . <p> Likewise , critics are n't satisfied by provisions that mining companies pay a fair market surface value . They believe they should have to not only pay royalties on production , but pay something up front for the value of the minerals , piled on top of the considerable costs associated with perfecting the mining claim . <p> 3 . Mining companies can sell the land for purposes other than mining and pocket huge profits . This claim is largely a canard in which mining critics continually cite the same few cases of past abuse . <p> The secretary of Interior has had the authority to suspend a mining patent if the land were being used for other than mining purposes . In a few cases there may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though it is the rule . " Inside Edition " cited what it said was a particularly alarming case out of Arizona . The program showed pictures of a hotel and golf course development in Phoenix , which the reporter said began life as a mining claim and cost the owner just over $ 100 . It was later sold , the reporter said , to developers for a $ 40 million project . " Inside Edition " made it sound as if the outrage occurred only minutes ago . <p> In fact , " Inside Edition " missed the " inside " story . Here it is : The land involved , in fact , was supposed to be a sand and gravel mine on the outskirts of Phoenix about 40 years ago . In the mid-1950s Congress exempted " common minerals " such as sand and gravel from the federal act . At the same time Phoenix was expanding and when its boundaries reached the site of the proposed gravel mine , the city government acted to prevent the mining operations . Locked in and prevented from mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , which was later developed for a golf course and hotel . The development has been used ever since by mining critics as proof of how bad the law is . What did they want to happen ? Stop the growth of Phoenix ? Have gravel mines within city limits ? The more important point is that the legislation before congress now includes reverter clauses that would elminate even the few cases where there has been abuse . The legislation would assure that - never mind the Interior secretary - federal land claimed for mining could not be used for other purposes without first reverting to the federal government . <p> 4 . Mining , because it can despoil the land , produces no offsetting benefits . The truth is new mining in the United States has been brought to a standstill . Mining companies are for the most part devoting more and more of their resources to overseas development . <p> The top 10 countries in terms of current interest include Argentina , Brazil , Kazakhstan , Peru , Chile , Ghana , South Africa , Indonesia , Uzbekistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place , pending new legislation . <p> Congress is trying to resolve the twin issues of what to do about damage from old mining activity and what to do with the regulation of new mines . <p> One of the changes proposed is to use some of the estimated $ 175 million in new revenue from royalties and land sales , and apply it to cleaning up past pollution . <p> There are ongoing arguments between the two sides on how much should go to cleanup work . There are also arguments about how to make the rules of cleanup consistent in the various states . <p> As much as " Inside Edition " and other news programs might wish to make mining into a simple dispute between the " good guys " and the " bad guys , " it is not a simple issue . If the nation wants to create funds to clean up past pollution , it will need a healthy mining industry to finance the process . If it wants to keep the cost of minerals and metals down for the benefit of the consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations .
