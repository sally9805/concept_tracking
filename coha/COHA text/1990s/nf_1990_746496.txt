HEALTH POLICY <p> Health practitioners and others interested in health care policies are aware of the multiple environmental contingencies that interact to influence health policy . These policies are covered almost daily by newspapers and other mass media and are reviewed in trade and professional journals ( such as Journal of the American Public Health Association , Public Health Reports , and Science ) to keep social workers and others informed . It almost seems that Americans have become accustomed to multiple and , at times , apparently contradictory findings from biomedical research . We have also heard an on-going health policy debate . As part of that debate , social workers , in particular , are interested in the profession 's influence on health policy . <p> Selected issues that do or will affect the nation 's health policy are discussed here . Health care policy is broadly conceptualized here to include issues related to health care delivery , biomedical research , education and training focused on health , and disease prevention and health promotion . Factors that influence health care delivery and are perceived to affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings are emphasized . In addition , two questions were taken into consideration when the issues presented below were selected : ( 1 ) What are-the factors that are expected to influence social work departments in hospitals and mental health settings ? And ( 2 ) how do these factors differ by geography or in other ways ? <p> Many of these issues are not new , and social workers have discussed them in forums and publications . The Annual Meeting and Educational Conference of the Society for Hospital Social Work Directors of the American Hospital Association and the society 's training events , and the National Association of Social Workers Annual Meeting serve as forums for reviewing health policy issues . In addition , several recent articles have focused on policy issues . For example , Berkman , Bonander , Kemler , Marcus , and Isaacson ( 1988 ) suggested that these policy topics deserve special attention : health care financing , Medicare and Medicaid , long-term health care , primary health care , special populations , and social work services . Rossen ( 1987 ) added that the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . She identified several factors that will influence that change : The increase in the numbers of elderly people , rising health care costs , ethical issues related to health care access , consumerism , hospital competition , cost containment , and case management . Black ( 1984 ) urged that opportunities for social work creativity and leadership have emerged that include reclaiming social work 's focus on community health , and providing clinical services for people who face complex value and lifestyle decisions . <p> All of these topics and issues are important , and because of their complexity they may seem formidable to some hospital and mental health personnel . But social workers have focused on formidable issues for quite some time and many are aware of the multiple changes that are taking place . Within the framework of those changes , the following issues are presented that have national importance . Environmental Issues <p> Health Care Quality . Quality care is becoming an issue for almost every patient who comes into contact with the complicated health care delivery system . For example , even though only 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission on the Accreditation of Health Organizations UCAHO ) , JCAHO wants greater emphasis on quality care ( Koska , 1989 ) . JCAHO identified several quality problem areas for hospitals seeking accreditation . Forty to 88 percent of hospitals were cited for the following reasons : drug usage evaluation , inpatient safety management , medical staff monitoring and evaluation , surgical case review , inpatient life safety , radiological monitoring and evaluation , governance , nuclear medicine monitoring and evaluation , pathology/lab monitoring and evaluation , clinical privileges , and special care monitoring and evaluation . In fact , JCAHO is planning to require that hospitals report statistics on how well patients are cared for by increasing data collection from one indicator of patient care for each specialty to four indicators next year ( Okie , 1989 ) . <p> Another noteworthy shift involves the accreditation group itself and their name change . The accreditation organization for hospitals recently expanded their focus . Their traditional focus has been on hospitals and their name reflected that focus  --  Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals . Now their emphasis includes not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission on the Accreditation of Health Organizations . Could this foreshadow other changes ? <p> Available Resources . As we move into the 1990s , many Americans are realizing that resources are limited . Health care costs are now growing faster than inflation and are taking a larger portion of the gross national product ( GNP ) . Health care expenditures in the United States are expected to reach $544 billion and to account for more than 11 percent of the GNP ; public sector spending is expected to account for 41 percent or $223 billion of that amount ( Durenberger , 1989 ) . Restructuring the nation 's $600 billion-a-year health care system has been the focus of many national groups and committees . A recent advocate is the Social Security Council 's chairperson , whose goal is to restructure the nation 's fragmented health care system into a coherent and efficient whole that would provide all needed services to every American and curb overutilization and medical inflation ( Rich , 1989 ) . Although more than 30 million Americans are not covered by health insurance , a driving force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby boom generation , which will be ready for retirement in the near future . The chairperson added that it is time to review and revise policies before the surge in elderly population ( Rich , 1989 ) . <p> Hospital Competition . During the past several years , more hospital advertisements have appeared , particularly in newspapers and on television . Some of those ads have included descriptions of luxurious rooms with meals prepared by chefs , and apartment settings for family and friends to visit and stay , if necessary . These advertisements suggest that this quality does not cost much more , but that it is worth the additional cost . Thus , the physical environment becomes the standard of quality . <p> Hand in hand with hospital competition is cost containment , a major national effort of the past several years to control expanding health care costs . It has been suggested that cost containment is taking precedence over other factors ( Leukefeld , 1989 ) and that diagnostic related groups are the most powerful approach for cost containment and establishing payment rates for providers . Changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growth in health maintenance organizations , which provide comprehensive medical services to enrolled subscribers in a prepaid system of care . Preferred provider organizations also are used to enhance efficiency and control costs by providing a network of physicians and hospitals for certain health services to a specified insured population at previously negotiated rates ( Brown , 1983 ) . <p> Cost containment may have affected rural hospitals in a special way  --  by causing their closing . In fact , it has been suggested that approximately 600 of the remaining 2,700 rural hospitals are likely to close by the end of 1990 ( Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , 1987 ) . Mullner , Rydman , Whiteis , &; Rich ( 1989 ) , in their epidemiologic case-control study of 161 closed rural hospitals and 483 open rural hospitals ( matched 1 to 3 ) , found that four variables positively correlated with risk of closure : ( 1 ) for-profit ownership ; ( 2 ) nongovernment , not-for-profit ownership ; ( 3 ) presence of a skilled nursing or other long-term care unit ; ( 4 ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wakefield , Schultz , Williams , &; VandenBos ( 1989 ) indicated that 24 percent of the U.S. population ( 56 million people ) live in nonmetropolitan areas , and they suggested that in many ways rural America appears to be little different from urban America . They added that individuals who live in nonmetropolitan areas are older , less well educated , more racially and ethnically homogeneous , and have lower incomes . However , Hogan ( 1988 ) found , in a study of rural hospitals , that rural hospital closure may harm the elderly . An analysis of distances New York rural residents traveled for hospital care indicated that few residents 75 and older went beyond their county for health care ; most were hospitalized locally . Twenty-nine percent of residents went outside their county for care , presenting an interesting dilemma for rural residents because hospitals usually serve other community functions in addition to patient care . Patient Care Issues <p> AIDS and HIV Infection . Acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) is having a major impact on urban public hospitals . The U.S. Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than 270,000 people will develop AIDS in the United States , that 1 to 1.5 million people are now infected with the virus that causes AIDS , and that 54,000 people will die from AIDS each year ( Coolfont Report , 1986 ) . Gay men and intravenous drug users are the two major risk groups for the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Recent attention has focused on intravenous drug users , who make up 31 percent of adult AIDS cases , are disproportionately black and Hispanic , usually are in major urban areas , and are changing their behaviors only to a limited degree ( Leukefeld , 1988 ) . <p> During the early 1980s , when the AIDS epidemic was beginning , public hospitals were starting to have funding problems . At that time , public hospitals had a growing proportion of resources devoted to bad debt and charity care  --  an increase of 11 percent from 1980 to 1982 ( Hadley &; Feder , 1983 ) . AIDS has exacerbated the problem , because many people with AIDS are both medically indigent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , in 1987 , public hospitals lost an average of 8218 per AIDS patient per day , which was more than 5 times the average daily loss for all hospital patients . Andrulis suggested that in light of the AIDS epidemic , health care decisions will determine whether public hospitals face the epidemic adequately or become crippled . He suggested three policy alternatives . First , a status quo response that would place the responsibility for care increasingly with the public sector . Public hospitals would suffer most because there would be no incentives for private providers to treat AIDS patients . Second , incremental change that would provide financing to keep pace with AIDS hospital care and the continuance of Medicaid support . Third , fundamental and systemwide change that would recognize long-term needs , including growing numbers of persons with AIDS in public hospitals , and incorporate a comprehensive and coordinated approach . Clearly , HIV infection remains a challenge for social work and other health practitioners as well as for researchers who are attempting to develop a vaccine . However , behavioral change remains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus . <p> Drug Abuse . The media is currently awash with stories related to the availability of drugs , drug abuse , and , more specifically , tragedies related to crack cocaine . Crack is highly addictive , inexpensive , available , and can be purchased in most American cities on the street and in crack houses . In response to the drug problem , the president recently appointed a drug czar and forwarded the 1989 National Drug Control Strategy to Congress for their consideration and action ( National Drug Control Strategy , 1989 ) . This strategy establishes national priorities and suggests that the country 's drug problem is getting worse . The strategy outlines national priorities related to drugs for the criminal justice system ; drug treatment ; education , community action and the workplace ; international initiatives ; interdiction efforts ; research ; and intelligence . Unfortunately , the increasing infant mortality rates are being related to crack use by inner city mothers . <p> The problem is real and highlighted by the Gallup Poll conducted in 1989 , which found that Americans see drug abuse as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation , 1989 ) . Drug abuse also is an issue for hospitals , especially public hospitals in urban areas , and when combined with AIDS among intravenous drug users , it is a major factor in public hospital crowding and loss of revenues . Hospitals and social workers are becoming actively involved in drug and alcohol abuse treatment and drug testing to identify on-the-job drug use ( Eisner , 1989 ) . <p> Elderly . The number of elderly people is increasing in the United States at a faster rate than the general population . Indeed , 11 percent of the population is 65 years and older and that group is projected to become 19 percent by the year 2025 ( Taueber , 1983 ) . Greene ( 1989 ) identified four demographic factors related to elderly people that will affect demand for hearth care services : First , the frail elderly , often defined as those older than 75 , are at high risk for physical and emotional health problems . In addition , they frequently lack social and environmental supports . Second , the number of older women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group older than 75 by the year 2000 , and they will require specialized services . Third , many elderly people who are members of racial minorities are considered at higher risk and will probably need additional services and supports . Fourth , although the elderly are healthier and more active than before , ill health is associated with becoming older and precipitates a variety of health-related issues . <p> The American Hospital Association ( AMA ) has suggested that hospitals , if they wish to establish themselves as leaders , will need to target aggressively and serve the expanding elderly market . To that end , AHA has outlined what can be done to meet the more complex and chronic illness needs and the special social needs of elderly people ( AMA , 1989 ) . AHA stressed discharge planning for elderly people that could begin at the time of hospital admission or before admission . Social work practitioners and educators should be mindful of this expanding population and be prepared for their needs . <p> These issues are examples of the varied issues that drive health policy . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas for attention . Common themes include financing within a changing environment and the needs of people with AIDS and the elderly . Perhaps health and mental health social work practitioners would identify different issues from the ones presented here . Nevertheless , this is a ripe area for research that should move beyond the deductive approach used here . <p>
