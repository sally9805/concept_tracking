ContentsPrologue 1 . 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9 . Epilogue # Over the last several years , Richard Bowes has staked out an area of urban fantasy all his own . In a shadowy New York City , characters who are part myth , part reality wander the streets . In " Streetcar Dreams , " he mingles his New York with current Jungian play therapy to come up with the last  --  and perhaps the best  --  Kevin Grierson story . <p> Prologue Our eyes finally met on this August morning , you a creature of light and I a middle-aged man in a rumpled suit . When I saw you my eyes filled with tears . I had only just figured out who you are . You have been aware of me for our whole lives . In the last few days , I 've thought a lot about my past . Now is the time to tell what I remember . <p> My name is Kevin Grierson . Last night two things happened : an old lover died and I talked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time we 've met in over twenty years . Besides looking a lot like me , he now looks just like Death . But I am a New Yorker and try to take these things in stride . <p> Three days ago , Sunday night at dinner , old friends reminisced . They are all slightly brittle careerists my age who had come to New York for school or their first jobs , and never left . As they talked about their early days , I sat silently and remembered my own first , desperate attempt on the city . <p> 1 . It began on a raw night in 1960 with my Shadow and myself under the elevated train platform at Field 's Comer in Boston . Our plan was simple , stupid , speed fueled . My parents were dead and I felt it was better to die than go back to school . Across the street , under the neon Malloy 's Bar and Grill sign , was my Uncle Jim 's place . I held him responsible for at least half my troubles . In my overcoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance our trip to New York . <p> My Shadow said , " I 'll check the place out . " I stood behind one of the iron El pillars and watched a skinny sixteen-year-old dodge traffic . <p> Then a voice in my ear said , " Rest easy . " Uncle Mike the cop patted me down , took the piece out of my pocket . " In the car , Kevy boy . Your friend keeps his distance if he knows what 's good for you . " We sat in the front seat of his Chevy . " You running away ? I 'm not going to stop you . " Mike broke open the .38 . It was loaded . " Coming back here to shoot Jim ? " <p> " Just scare him . " I saw my Shadow start to cross the street toward us and signaled him to stay back . <p> Mike seemed amused . " You with a gun is scary . But the sight of your playmate there is what 'd do him in . Jim takes things hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first double I ever saw . What is it Aunt Tay calls them ? Faileas ? Shadows ? Your mother had one too . Jim loved his little sister even so . And now you . It kills him . It kills me too . I look at my kids , I think about if that happened , what would I do ? Shoot them ? Shoot myself ? " <p> He let that sink in . Then he said , " You 're leaving you need money . It 's not a great bet . But I 'll put some dough on you not coming back . Jim will too . How much do you want ? <p> " Two hundred , " I said . I saw my Shadow beside a pillar shake his head . " No . Make it two fifty . " That seemed like big money . I was a stupid kid . My double was too . <p> He had big ideas about sugar daddies and lovely ladies in Gotham . What we found was a lot of people smarter and tougher than both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed and money gone , we sat on the stairs at Grand Central Station . Messed over body and soul , I turned to the dirty , strained face that was also mine and said , " This was your idea . What are we going to dot " All I got back was a duplicate of my own baffled expression . " Get lost , " I said . " Get lost ! " <p> As he faded , my bad side , my Shadow , whispered with real surprise . " Guess we ca n't live on my brains and your ass . " <p> Without him , I lost virginity I had n't known existed . One night I wandered around Hell 's Kitchen west of Time 's Square , and a guy smiled in passing . He seemed okay . I wanted someone to talk to and to take care of me and a place to be warm . <p> Down an alley we went and through a door . In a cellar room , he put his hands on my shoulders , ran me up against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept away from me was so creased by a thick scar that it looked like it had been crumpled . " Do n't be scared , little boy , " he said . " I 'll make sure this NEVER happens to you . Now let 's see what you got . " <p> A week later , out on the Deuce in a thin jacket and jeans , I cried on the skinny shoulder of Veronica , a young Spanish drag , in the lobby of a SRO hotel . She said , " Honey , Scar Face is the lowest . " Fishing a dime out of her bra , she asked , " Anyone you can call ? " <p> There was . Lots of my family were not anxious to see me again . But my Grand-Aunt Tay begged me to come back , wired the money . Many kids in my situation do not get that grace . <p> 2 . That was the memory I ran like a tape at Addle and Lauren 's place in Kip 's Bay Sunday night . Dinner was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friends . I let the conversation pass me by . As has happened for more than twenty years , the wine and grass did too . <p> Always when this happens , I pictured Leo Dunn , the man who brought me off booze and drugs . He sits in a big chair in his upper East Side apartment , his head framed by winter light from a window . " Your addiction is a Silent Partner who will lie and cheat , who will steal everything and leave you broke and holding the bag . " When he had said that I started calling my Shadow the Silent Partner . Mr. Dunn has been gone for twenty years now ; his image is like a talisman rubbed smooth with use . <p> No doubt my dinner companions attributed my being present and unaccounted for to George Halle 's having just been taken off life support . A wondrous soul , George had set me up in the world and now I was helping him out of it . <p> They were his friends as well as mine . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one closest to him . Spouse , lover , relative , business partner , are all ephemeral ties , easily broken . In the age of AIDS only primary caregiver continues until death does us part . <p> At some point the other guests said good-night , patted my hand , told me when they 'd visit the hospice . Finally Lauren and I sat in the ground floor consulting room as Addie listened to her answering machine . Lauren massaged my neck . " Think about Christmas in Santa Fe , " she murmured , including me in their plans . When her lover hung up , she said , " Talk to you during the week , Kevin . " <p> Addie told her , " I 'll be up in a little while . " Then we two sat with the lights dim and the windows open on the back yard and midnight . Here in the center of a block of five-story town houses ; street noise was muted . A couple argued at an open window , a hundred air conditioners hummed , but Manhattan in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tug hoot on the East River , the rumble of a long freight train on the Queen 's shore . <p> For a few minutes of harmony , we listened to each other breathe . Long ago , before she met Lauren , after I left George , there was Addle and me . One summer and fall , we went everywhere : plays , leather bars , Hoboken , bed . In my relations with humans , that species whose shadows do n't speak to them , I specialize in six weeks of frenzy and a lifetime of exchanging casserole recipes . <p> Middle age helps reduce all our faces to professional expressions . Addle , for instance , radiates calm and compassion , a handsome priestess . I have the antique toy dealer 's look of quizzical appraisal . But we knew each other before we had fully developed our masks . <p> " Let me show you what I found . " Addie rose and I followed her into the blue room . She flicked a switch and a light came on over the sand table . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the floor . A construction was still intact . <p> Addie started taking it apart . I saw a hill molded in the fine , white sand , the sides embossed with sea shells . Turrets and walls ringed the top . At its foot were a two-inch tall bear dressed in a clown suit , a trio of jolly , fat Chinese men , a smiling lady rider on her circus horse . <p> My first take was that it was a happy scene . On second glance , I saw that the hill was armored : a closed , empty castle . And the figures all faced away from a small pit in the sand where the figurine of a little girl lay face down . " The poor kid who built that , " I said . <p> Addie nodded . " We made progress yesterday . I left this up so Laurie could photograph it . " Addle is an analyst . Children are her specialty , Play Therapy one of her tools . On white shelves , built at child 's eye level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , African-American wedding parties and elephant-headed gods , pirates and nurses , three-masted junks , Madonnas , yellow dump trucks , lambs , chariots , anything kids might need to recreate their interior landscapes on the sand table . <p> I 'd helped her find a lot of these items . It 's what had brought us together . We had both found jobs that let us play with toys . " See what 's new ? " she asked . I heard a collector 's pride in her voice . <p> The streetcar stood , green and boxy , trolley up , between St. Francis with birds on his shoulders and a family of giraffes . The color was wrong and the shape , but it made me jump . " You 're uncanny ! It 's so long ago that I told you about the Streetcar Dreams . And I had one last night for the first time in years . " She gave a smug smile as if this was an elementary trick of her trade . <p> I turned to the shelves , saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Union Square subway station . Lots of people and noise . I went up stairs that exist only in these dreams to a platform with tracks at ground level , not down in a pit like subway trains . <p> " Streetcars stopped running in this city before I moved here . But one swept out of the dark . Orange , cigar-shaped , like they had in Boston when I was a kid . I boarded by the side door , sat at a window . The car started , lights and signals flowed past . We burst out of the tunnel and it was all black and white , New York in a 1940 's photo . " <p> As I spoke , I put the toy streetcar down on the sand and ran it back and forth to make tracks . I took buildings from the shelves , sets of European row houses , a gas station , a fire barn and crowded them right next to each other on one side of the tracks . On the other side of the tracks , I placed battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The streetcar seemed to run down the West Side waterfront , city blocks on the left , piers on the right . It was wartime . " I placed marching khaki soldiers and navy blue sailors in the landscape . <p> " Then I spotted a figure I seemed to recognize walking by . Not a child . Not an adult either . " Searching Addie 's shelves which held everything from Mongols to angels , I found nothing that looked right . " Whoever , whatever it was started to turn toward me . And I woke up before I saw the face . " <p> " Was it your Doppelganger ? " I had told Addle about my Shadow long ago . She had taken it well , though in psychiatry a belief in a double is the kind of thing that turns up in schizoids facing death . <p> " No . But my Shadow was on my mind . He has n't been around for years . Then a couple of weeks ago , a boy I 'd just met was convinced he already knew me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if I had an evil twin . And today , after the dream , our paths crossed . I think he wants to talk . It looks like he 's very sick . " <p> " Oh , Kevin ! " Addle hugged me . " You know this is probably a way of dealing with all that 's happened to George . " <p> She 's smarter than anyone I 've known since Leo Dunn . But she thought I was hallucinating . Besides , I 'm her friend , not a client . I was imposing . " You 're right , " I said rising . " It 's late . Sorry . " <p> " Not at all , " she said as best friends do . When we kissed on her front stairs , huge apartment towers across the way made me feel like we were miniatures on her sand table . <p> It had been a long day . I took a cab instead of walking the twenty blocks down Second Avenue . Stuyvesant Park was empty , its gates locked for the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The park shows up in a lot of movies . Odd since with iron fences , the Friends ' Meeting House , the statue of One-Legged Peter Stuyvesant , the flowers planted by the Episcopal Church ladies , it looks like something from a more quaint and quiet town . My apartment faces the north side of the park . I 'm on the third floor . It 's a quiet building . Everyone else in the co-op is middle-aged too . <p> On my answering machine were messages from Edwin Sandler , a remarkably rich antique toy collector , and Oscar Klackman , a minor skell and forger . I had business with both of them . The Dolbier collection , a million dollars worth of antique toy soldiers , was going to auction the next day . <p> Listening , I got into some pull-ons . The last message was a voice hesitant and lost . " Kevin , " a long pause . " Maybe I can see you later . " Matt Daniels was the young stranger who had thought he knew me the first time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I looked out the window and saw the streets full of cadets in overseas caps , cop shoes , paramilitary uniforms . A group of gay kids in sneakers , button-front boxer shorts and crew cuts passed by . The rival tribes eyed each other warily . Senior year of high school I got forced into both those styles . <p> 3 . Not everyone was happy when Grand-Aunt Tay brought me back from New York . The family house was being sold . My future got decided that Christmas as I lay in bed too sick and numb to care . Even Tay seemed angry . When I was a kid , she had taught me songs , told me stories about elves and changelings and people with Shadows like mine . " Do n't you be mad at me , Tay , please , I could n't stand that . " <p> And she said , " I 'm not mad at you , Kevin . I 'm afraid for you . " She recited a poem . Only now do I understand . At the time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> preJust we three go sailingMe , Myself and IOver walls and fencesThrough the night we fly At that time in Irish Catholic Boston , a young man in trouble with God and law was treated to a dose of military discipline . My share of the sale of the house sent me to Saint Sebastian , Soldier and Martyr in New Hampshire . That winter , I marched , went to morning mass , studied , exercised , prayed , got penitential hair cuts and took cold showers . For all but the last activity I was in some variation of a uniform much like the police cadets wear . <p> At St. Sebastian S &M,; no one knew anything about me , which was good . Beer , let alone drugs , was unobtainable and the brothers of the Sacred Cross made sure even sex with yourself was n't easy to arrange . One of my roommates prepped for West Point , another prayed in his sleep . <p> My grades were bad . I could n't focus . The face in the mirror seemed to be a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hid razor blades , tested pipes to see if they could hold my weight . <p> That 's when the dreams began . In them , I woke up in apartments I 'd never seen before , talked to people I did n't recognize . Once , I snapped open something like a switchblade . When someone made a heavy pass , I heard my voice whisper , " I 'm not real good at close body work . " My Shadow woke as I slept . <p> Around then I turned from thoughts of offing myself to Science Fiction , Childhood 's End , Twilight World , Citizen of the Galaxy . Alternate worlds , mutant teens , alien conquerors are an easy fit when you 've just done fifty push-ups because your brass was n't shined , a Doppelganger cruises your dreams and a man in a dress lectures you about chastity . <p> The brothers always had the final word . The last day of spring term , I sat at the back of the class reading A Canticle for Liebowitz , trying not to notice the graduating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Grierson will be with us this summer , " said the teacher and the seniors snickered . Summer term was the black hole , punishment detail . The uniform featured khaki shorts . <p> In 1961 , being a guy was defined by jeans , black chinos , pegged slacks . The only males between six and forty who wore shorts in public were dorks , fairies , social cripples . <p> Two weeks later Uncle Bob deposited me at the Park Square bus station . " This is your last chance , Kevin . Blow it and you have no place to go . " He seemed as amused as a lawyer ever gets to be by my public depantsing . I stared at my bare knees feeling like all I needed was Mickey Mouse cars and , maybe , polka-dot boxers to make my ensemble complete . <p> Uncle Bob drove off and a car full of kids came by . They honked and when I looked their way , they gave me the finger . In my boy scout outfit and last-all-summer crew cut , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no control over his life . These guys were going to the beach , to see their girl friends , to parties . My life was going to be barracks mental hospitals , prisons . <p> Just then , I caught a glimpse of a familiar figure walking up to the Staler Hotel across the street . My Shadow 's hair and clothes were cool . He wore a great pair of shades . When I looked again , he was gone . <p> But I took that eye flash as a kind of promise of what could be . Summer term was kind of loose . I cheated , I flirted , I lied . I even studied . My SAT 's and College Board scores were impressive . I 'd forgotten I was n't stupid . The brothers took credit for turning me around . I knew better . <p> Aunt Tay arranged my late admission to huge , anonymous Mass . Arts and Science . College was good to me . I majored in English but hung around the drama department . I looked young . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the important thing was that amid the general dislocation and chaos of school , I finally learned to play the role of a human well enough to pass . <p> I 'd had plenty of time to edit and shape my adventures . " It was speed and booze , " I told my dorm mates in the hard-ass version . " This lady stepped on my heart so I stole a gun , held up my uncle and took off for New York ... " Certain details got omitted . My Shadow especially . <p> More poured out with Sarah , a girl I 'd met . " Chicken hawks jump-started me before I knew what was going on . After my mother died , that scene became a big school and family scandal . The only thing I could think to do was run . New York was bad . Since then , I 've been afraid to let anyone touch me . " <p> Self-serving no doubt . But getting to take the lead for the first time in my life with someone I cared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay tangled together in the borrowed apartment , though , I saw my Shadow looking on . He had been left out of this account too . <p> The campus was connected to Boston by a streetcar line . Ever since I was a little kid , I had loved the cars , the old square orange ones , the new cigar-shaped model , liked seeing them lined up in the yards , loved the trolley sparks on wires in the dark , the rattle of the change box , the sway of the ride , the clatter of the wheels . <p> One October afternoon , broke and hung-over , I headed into town . The car rolled through the wooded suburban landscape , past a big house I recognized . In the months before New York , I 'd known the daughter of the place . In rosy memory that time had been full of drugs , sex and ready cash . <p> At that moment , a voice whispered in my ear , " Found your life lacks a certain zest ? " I said nothing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My Shadow said , " I want to make up for what happened . " When I did n't reply he said , " Without you , I do n't even half exist . " <p> This time I would be in control and use my Shadow . I dictated terms . " You stay away from school and my family . Weekends , I 'll come in town and we 'll get together . " He kept his side of the deal for a long while . Going into Boston , I 'd take the streetcar and he 'd appear as the suburban landscape rattled past . <p> In town , I slipped into the life he 'd established . My face gave me a juicy role : Angel With A Blade . " Bad little boy ! " giggled a fat john , slapping my butt . I flicked open my Shadow 's gravity knife and put myself firmly back on top . <p> Booze and drugs made it possible for me not to wonder why I was doing this . It was the age of Speed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a hero . Junior year , I stood in a pad in Cambridge as a fat lady in an orange muumuu counted out two hundred black beauties for me and my customers . Meanwhile , a skinny , shirtless guy with wild eyes and a machete stuck in his belt tried to focus on my Shadow , who lounged in the doorway . " He 's not her double , " my Doppelganger murmured later , " But he 's something damn close . " <p> Time ran fast and I turned twenty-one in the spring semester of senior year . After graduation I planned to move to New York . All the kids in the drama department were doing the same , so there would be safety in numbers . I had n't told my Shadow . Gotham was where you gave your past the slip . <p> Early one morning , the phone in the hall of the residence house cut through my hangover . On the other bed , my roommate snored in counterpoint to the ringing . It was right outside our door and nobody was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing on the cold floor , I went out to the hall . The phone stopped in mid-ring . <p> And there he was , wearing my bathrobe and my face , speaking in my voice . " Oh my God ! Thanks , Uncle Bob . I do n't know what to say . I 'll be over there as fast as I can . " <p> As he hung up , I whispered . " We had a deal . What are you doing here ? " <p> His eyes , when he turned to me , were unreadable . " Aunt Tay died . " I doubled up like I 'd been hit in the stomach . He put the robe over my shoulders . " You 'll need something to get you through this , " he murmured . " There 's a half pint of whiskey in the pocket and some dexies . Do you really think you could survive here or in New York without me ? " he asked . <p> " Fuck you , " I said . But I did n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we two were alone . I showered and dressed in what Tay and I called my confirmation outfit : blue blazer , gray slacks and a rep tie . I stuck sun glasses and the bottle in my pockets . <p> At that hour nobody much was around the campus . The streetcar , though , was full of commuters . We passed the big old house . Over the years , it got more deserted-looking each time . <p> I put on my shades , got off at the next stop and walked up there . Through the windows , I saw furniture covered with cloths . I went around to the back , found a porch and sat on the stairs . The garden was overgrown , but flowers had started to bloom . Birds sang . A car door slammed a few houses down . <p> I took out the bottle and drank , a sip at first , then a swallow . " Let me find you some more , " said my Shadow . Alone , I thought of Grand-Aunt Tay . The last time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me when I came back from New York . " What was it again ? " I asked and she said : <p> preJust we three go sailingMe , Myself and IOver walls and fencesThrough the night we flyPeople half awakenHear us pass and prayOut of fearing for our souls , Wo n't we rest and stay And I said , " Gee , I thought I had problems and there are only two of me . " Tay smiled then and so did I. That was the memory of her that I wanted to save . <p> 4 . My door buzzer yanked me back to the present . I stumbled off of the couch , went to the intercom and said , " Wha ? " <p> " Kevin ? " The voice was slurred , uncertain . " Can I come up ? Please ? " It sounded like Matt . But after ringing him in , I stood ready to slam the door on the off chance I found my own mug coming at me . <p> Street fashion in clothes and hair were a flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face belonged to Matt Daniels , stoned , good-looking and twenty-three . Our first meeting , with him convinced he knew me , should have made me wary . Instead , I had let myself grow fond of this stranger . My Shadow is clever that way . <p> " Key ! " His body vibrated slightly as he leaned against me . He smelled of smoke and booze , Obsession and sweat , the scent of the clubs . His dark hair was short and slick as an otter 's . " Sorry I woke you , " he said . " Andre 's gone crazy . I ca n't stay there . I need to lie down . " He shrugged . The rest was up to me . Doubtless I was not his resting place of first resort . But his vulnerability chilled me . <p> In the bedroom he sprawled in nothing but his tan and the tattooed wings over his left nipple , the winding snake on his right thigh . Neither of us was real excited . He smiled , puzzled , as I tucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living room . <p> Leo Dunn once told me , " We have to perform a delicate balancing act : to remember our addiction , to be aware of it , without ever letting those memories engulf us . " Mr. Dunn had identified my Shadow as the manifestation of addiction and depravity . I dozed off wondering why , if the Shadow was evil , I was not all that good . <p> The next thing I knew , I was sitting at the rear of a moving streetcar . The neighborhood through which we rolled was not unlike the one where I grew up . For the first time , I noticed the driver . He looked straight ahead but I knew he had spotted me in the mirror . I counted a dozen passengers . Even from the back they all seemed familiar . <p> Then I realized they were all people I loved who had died . I was about to get up and go to them when I saw someone in the distance waiting for the car . It was the figure from my last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Addie . <p> Before we got close enough for me to see the face , a telephone rang and I opened my eyes . The sun shone at a late morning angle . My voice message clicked on behind my head . I lay on my living room couch . After the beep , a familiar voice asked , " Grierson , where the hell are you ? " <p> " Ah . Mr. Sandler , " I babbled , trying to figure out what day it was . " How are things in California ? " Edwin Sandler is the fat kid who owns all the toys . Malcolm Forbes probably had more . But Forbes is dead while Sandler walks among us still . You may have seen him on the news when he bought an old Southern Pacific roundhouse to accommodate his vintage electric trains . George and I have acted as his New York agents for almost twenty years . <p> " Did you look at the Dolbier Collection ? You were supposed to call . Is lot 98 authentic ? " <p> It came back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , hollow cast , old . Intensely desirable , at least to Sandler and a limited number of other people . " I had someone look at the lot , " I lied . " He says yes . But I 'm on my way up to Masby 's for the pre-auction viewing . " <p> " Well , if it 's authentic , I want it . Do n't let that little fart Jonesy get it . He 's beaten us out a couple of times recently . You have the list of other lots I 'm interested in . But 98 is the important one . And I do n't want to pay more than the estimate . " Then with no change of tone , he said , " I hear George is n't doing so well . " <p> Some days I was able to spend twenty minutes or half an hour before getting wrenched by a reminder of George . " That 's right , " I managed to say . <p> " It 's a shame . You and he are young men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventies . He has n't come near either of us since George 's illness became general knowledge . I thanked him for his concern and said good-bye , very tired of Sandler and this whole business . <p> It was well after ten o'clock . My mind was a blank as I sat up and looked at the catalog again . On the cover , under the title , The August Dolbier Collection , Antique Toy Soldiers 1885-1920 , I had written , " Ozzie Klackman . Masby's. 11 A.M. " <p> I put a kettle on the stove . In the bedroom , Matt lay , arms and legs akimbo , like he had been knocked flat . When I touched his chest , he stirred . I showered , shaved , had tea and granola . I changed into blazer , slacks and rep tie . I believe that outfit inspires trust . It also reminds me of Tay . " Do I have time for a shower ? " Matt stood , hesitant , rubbing his eyes , one foot on top of the other . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pity the poor urchin . " But waking up with no clear idea of where you 've been and where you 're going next is a hard way to start a morning . I wanted to tell him that . I even thought of telling him he could stay . <p> But if the advantages of commodity sex are neatness and anonymity , those are also its drawbacks . I did n't know where to begin . So I just said , " Sure , " and turned to answer the ringing phone . <p> " Hey , Grierson , you said be at Masby 's at eleven sharp , Monday morning . I 'm here with my meter running . Where are you ? " <p> " At home , Ozzie , otherwise you would n't be speaking to me . " Every trade has its skullduggers , resurrectionists , procurers . Antique toys is no exception . Ozzie Klackman is all those things and more . <p> " Sharp , sharp . Everyone 's always saying ' Old Kevin G. is going soft . ' But I tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his marbles and he 's selling them at twenty bucks a pop in that swank little Greenwich Village boutique of his . ' " <p> " Hang on . I 'm on my way . " <p> It had taken Klackman to remind me about my own store . I dialed Half Remembered Things . After many rings Lakeisha answered , sounding out of breath . " You just got a UPS delivery , " she said . " From Maryland someplace . Gettysburg ? " <p> " Gaithesburg ? " Vaguely I recalled purchasing a load of 1950 's tin wind-up cars . " I 'm not going to be in until late this afternoon . " Remembering myself at seventeen , I had qualms about leaving her in charge . " Will you be okay ? " <p> " There is no doubt in my mind . " She was offended that I would question this . It was reassuring . Parts of my life still ran in an orderly way . <p> By the time I was at the door , Matt was set . " Hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm supposed to start at a restaurant part time ... " I put a few tens in his T-shirt pocket . There 's a cosmic daisy chain in which I get to pay back everything I earned in trade plus interest and inflation adjustment . <p> As we walked down the stairs , I said , " The first time we met , you mixed me up with another guy . Have you seen him since ? " Caught , he paused before he shook his head . Matt is incapable of lying . That is , like then , he ca n't hide it when he 's not telling the truth . <p> We were on the sunlit sidewalk . Over in the park , the fountain played , a day-care center 's worth of tiny kids ran and screamed . A young Latino lady in silk drawers rode by on a bike and looked Matt 's way . I said , " The one you met is my Shadow . " How to explain ? " A slightly less than imaginary friend . " <p> Matt looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought he was going to add , " As real as you . " Instead he said , " Sorry to bust in on you last night . " <p> " I was happy for the company . " We had walked over to Third Avenue . He touched my shoulder as I hailed a cab . " See you tonight ? " I asked and he nodded . Driving away , I looked back and saw him at a pay phone . I wondered if he was on his way to my Shadow . Heading uptown to Masby 's Auctioneers , I thought of how there was no way to warn the young about pain . <p> 5 . In the Autumn of 1969 , a couple of years older and even dumber than Matt , I stood in a kitchen in Cambridge Mass . The woman in the muumuu watched me zip up my fatigue jacket . I was so thin that there was room in my clothes for me and several pounds of methadrine . She stopped mumbling chemical formulae long enough to tell the skinny guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The skinny guy still wore no shirt but now had a Colt automatic stuck in the waistband of his bellbottoms . He had grown a big mustache and his skin was so taut that every rib looked ready to burst out . He pushed open the back door and said , " All clear , " in a crazed chipmunk voice . <p> Outside the kitchen , an alley ran between wooden houses . Where it opened onto the street , my Shadow stood in a jacket and tie . It made the pair inside too jumpy when they saw both of us together . <p> " Walk easy , " he said . " The heat is only interested in the Commie commune . " As we headed for the Central Square subway , Sisters ' School kids , home for lunch , ran past us , past a three-story house with red trim and pictures of Che Guevera in all the windows , past the detectives in their car . <p> Two hours later , I walked through Logan Airport , dressed in the jacket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea was to look like a student , or like the bright young copywriter I had been a year or two before . Then I caught sight of myself in a mirror , minus an overcoat on a chilly day , wearing the shades it was best never to take off , hair down to my shoulders because barbers gave me the same feeling as dentists . I looked like nothing so much as a speed courier . <p> Guys in uniform moved toward me , blocked the exits , called to each other . I bit my tongue hard , got ready to bolt . The voice in my ear said , " Off-duty pilots , chauffeurs . Nothing to do with us . Take a deep breath . " <p> Northeast Airline 's three P.M. New York shuttle was full enough to give me cover but not so crowded that my Shadow could n't have the seat next to me . Salesmen bent over reports . A silver wing shone outside the window . I had just snorted junk in the bathroom and was serene . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Buy your ticket , " my invisible friend told me . I drew out the crisp tens I 'd put aside and realized too late that one was still rolled up from my bon voyage blast . <p> The last leg down from Cambridge was by cab . " We split with the crank , " my Shadow told me . " Burn everyone before they burn us . Leave no forwarding address . " <p> Ahead of us , the setting sun balanced on the towers of Manhattan . Behind us rose a sickle moon . " Where would we go ? " I asked . <p> " Anywhere . We are about to earn fifteen hundred for delivering sixty-five grand worth of crank . We can go anywhere . " I shook my head . The Spanish cabby paid us no mind . We got out in the fragment of a neighborhood where the Queens Midtown Tunnel opens onto Manhattan . <p> Angie 's loft was upstairs in a two-story building on a truncated block . No one else lived on the street of garages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city like a river . I rang and waited where Angie could see me from his window . <p> " No wonder they call drug couriers mules , " my Shadow whispered . But when I shivered uncontrollably and had trouble stopping , he shut up . Sometimes I scared us both . <p> Finally , the buzzer sounded . Inside was a flight of stairs . At the top was a door with a peephole . Again I waited as they looked me over . " Run ! " my Shadow suddenly cried . And I almost did . <p> The door flew open . A guy put an automatic at my forehead and gestured me inside . His eyes were dead , cold pins , his mouth a slit . But on his throat was a long curved scar like a smile . Other hands grabbed the bag and hauled me into the room . <p> Angie and Lars , his partner , lay face down on the Persian carpet in a pool of blood . I got shoved onto the floor near them . My Shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> 6 . Outside Masby 's on Park Avenue I paid the cabby and sized up the crowd . Despite the auction being in the off-season , most major collectors or their agents had gathered . I was willing to bet that none had my exact business background . Masby 's staff assigned me paddle #163 . <p> Stepping into the showroom , I nodded to the big white-mustached guy who 's a retired colonel , to the Trasks , a husband-and-wife team of gnomes , and to Maxwell Jones , a shiny-faced child of sixty-five . Klackman , my hired accomplice , lounged against a display case . We pretended not to see each other . <p> Recorded marches played . Tiny conveyer belts drew handpainted guardsmen in red coats , hussars on plunging horses , through display dioramas of castles and battlefields . American Indians in wild , impossible costumes galloped forever around a wagon train . The figures were eighty , ninety , a hundred years old . The kids for whom they had been bought were aged or dead . But here perpetually was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I represented Sandler . Eyes followed me as I approached lot #98 , Rare , maybe unique , it stood in a display case by itself : French army medical figures , horse-drawn ambulances , supply wagons , hospital tents , stretchers , patients , nurses , doctors . It was attributed to William Britain Ltd. , the famous English toy company , made in its Paris office circa 1910 . The estimate was $20,000-$24,000 dollars . Sandler always gave a bonus when I bought an item for the estimate or under . It would take some doing in this instance . <p> Madge Brierly , the decayed gentlewoman whom Masby 's has employed ever since I can remember , asked if I wanted the case opened . I nodded and asked , " Are you working the phones ? " <p> " But of course . " <p> Examining a two-inch-tall hand-painted doctor , I tried to remember all that George had taught me . The uniform , once brilliant red and blue , the bright cheeks and black mustache , had in age acquired a nice patina . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for toys is their passage through the hands of their young owners . Unworthy , at first , of adult attention , few survive intact . " Much pre-bidding ? " I kept my voice low . Such information is confidential . <p> Her shrug indicated that pre-auction bids were less than the estimate . " It seems August Dolbier 's reputation was n't the best . " <p> Right on cue , a voice called , " Grierson ! " Heads turned . Madge stepped away as if to avoid contamination . Shabby , grinning , in need of a shave and doubtless a drink , Ozzie Klackman approached . In a loud , hoarse whisper I hoped everyone caught , he told me . " Anybody can have old antiques . But how many can have brand new ones ? " <p> Value in an antique depends on rarity and integrity . Repairs , repainting , diminish the worth . Fraud and forgery are not uncommon . Those are Klackman 's specialties . Everyone knew Klackman had worked for Dolbier and that Dolbier had been untrustworthy . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was his work . <p> The figure looked authentic to me . I replaced it in the case and went on to view other lots . Then the crowd began to buzz . The auction was ready to start . Usually , I stayed at the back of the hall . Today , I was up front in plain sight with Ozzie right beside me . <p> Hillary Westall , chief auctioneer , bright and stiff as a toy soldier himself , stepped to the podium . Madge Brierly stood at his left , receiver to ear , ready for phone bids . All attention focused on Westall as he said in clipped tones , " Lot #1 , Britain 's set #6 . Boer Cavalry . Original box . Circa 1902 . Bidding will start at $1,000 . It is with the room . " <p> Klackman said nothing . I raised my paddle to establish my presence . " $1,000 . Do we have $1,250 ? " Madge signaled that someone on the phone had topped my bid . The phones were my problem and my opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . <p> Westall looked my way on each lot . I raised my paddle regularly . Klackman said , " Hey , you got that one ! " a few times . <p> " Lot #71 . Lucotte Napoleonic General Staff . Thirty pieces . Circa 1890 . Bids start at $1,200 , " said Westall . <p> A moment later Klackman whispered , " That asshole Jonesy got it for twice the estimate and the only part of it that 's authentic is the tail on Napoleon 's horse ! " I made like I was very annoyed at having lost . <p> A few minutes later , timing it carefully , I rose and walked up the aisle followed by a grinning Klackman as Westall said , " Lot #98 , Britain 's depose . Medical ... " Jonesy glanced at us sharply and immediately turned his attention back to the podium . <p> More than face or paddle number , location is identity . An auctioneer looks to the place where she or he last saw the bidder . Giving up the place I 'd established signaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on lot #98 . <p> " We start at $17,500 . " Immediately , a phone bid came in and Madge relayed it to Westall . Only those in the room had witnessed Ozzie Klackman 's fouling the authenticity of this lot . A phone bidder might still be willing to shoot for the moon . <p> Phone bids came in for $18,000 and $18,500 . But those on the scene congratulated themselves on their first-hand knowledge . <p> As I reached the front window , Westall said , " We stand at $19,000 for a unique artifact . Going once ... " I stood behind all the other bidders directly in Madge Brierly 's line of sight . She gazed off , thinking , perhaps , of better times . I smiled and lifted my paddle . She listened to a phone bid and looked right through me as she relayed it to Westall . <p> " $19,500 . The bid is with the room . Do we have $20,000 . Going once , twice ... " <p> I waved my paddle frantically . Madge squinted , perhaps her eyesight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " $20,000 . Thank you , " he said and everyone present assumed it was a phone bid . <p> Then people actually on the phone raised it to $20,500 and $21,000 . Again I waved my paddle . Again Madge looked my way but could n't find me . " Going once , twice ... " I handed the paddle to Klackman who waved it back and forth like he was guiding a dirigible in for a landing . She nodded and spoke to Westall. " $21,500 . Going Once . Twice . Sold to paddle #163 who has chosen to migrate . " <p> Jonesy turned around amazed and Ozzie Klackman said , " Hey , my meter is running ! " In the foyer , I passed him three hundred dollars in tens and twenties and he said , " Very slick , Mr. G. Especially the part where you became the Invisible Man . " His voice in my ear that afternoon had reminded me of my Shadow . <p> After I 'd arranged payment and shipping on Sandler 's lots , Madge Briefly and I slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had iced tea and chicken salad while she polished off a surprising number of vodka and tonics and dished the auction world establishment . <p> I mentioned having been afraid that she was n't going to recognize my bid and Madge said , " It was odd . I could see that oaf Klackman all too clearly . But you , somehow , kept getting lost against the sunlight in the windows . " <p> Before we parted , I surprised myself by saying , " A good-sized collection is about to come onto the market . Toys of all kinds . " The collection I had in mind was the inventory of George 's and my store . Until that moment , I had n't known I was about to sell . <p> When I was thirteen , I gave away my toys because I thought I was grown up . Actually all that had happened was that someone had sex with me . I thought of that as I paid the cabby on the corner of Bleeker across from HALF REMEMBERED THINGS . <p> The store exists among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as a ten-year-old boy 's bedroom , circa 1954 . The cowboy and rocket ship decor was George 's last project . <p> Inside , framed by Howdy-Doody drinking glasses , a mint Fun On The Farm Game , Sergeant Preston of the Yukon lunch boxes , Lakeisha was on the phone . She buzzed me in without hanging up . Lakeisha is the daughter of one of George 's nurses . Just out of high school , she is , like it or not , on her way to St. Regis College in Rhode Island this fall . George wanted very much for her to go to school outside the city . <p> She might have done something with her hair since Saturday . But I was n't sure , so I said , " You look wonderful , " which is always safe and true . The curves of her chin , the lines of her cheek are flawless in the way black faces can be . I looked at the register and saw that we had done seventy-four dollars and ninety-five cents business that day . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man from Saturday came back and bought the doll house chair , " Lakeisha said after hanging up . " Some people left messages . " She looked past me out the window . <p> Turning , I saw her confidante , Claudia of the three-inch green nails with smiley faces painted on them and Claudia 's boyfriend James , a chubby , good-natured kid . Standing behind them on the corner was Lakeisha 's latest , Lionel , a wiry little snake . Lakeisha is unlucky in love . " You want to go ? " I asked . And as the words left my mouth , Lakeisha said goodnight and that she 'd see me tomorrow . <p> My shop-keeper neighbors do n't like seeing African-American kids around . I watched Lionel , almost lost in his baggy clothes , put his arms about Lakeisha . They seemed so young and vulnerable . In the two years I 've known her , a couple of Lakeisha 's friends have been killed . Claudia 's arm was slashed on the subway . Even Lionel I recognized as a fellow changeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human child . <p> The first couple of phone messages were routine business . A lady asked if we sold sex toys . Some guy wondered if we had Mr. Potato Head WITH his pipe . Then I heard Gina Raille ask , " Kevin , can I talk to you ? " Even before returning that call , I knew it was about my Shadow . <p> Gina and I go all the way back to college . Of all the bunch from the drama department , she 's the one who 's still acting . This summer , she stepped into a feature role in the musical Gumshoe ! <p> A few weeks before , we had run into each other one evening on Broadway and Tenth by Grace Churchyard . She looked at me with curiosity and concern and asked , " Key , do you have an evil twin you never told anyone about ? There 's this guy around the theater district . He 's raddled , wild . Maybe it 's my imagination running away , but he seems to recognize me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's kind of stupid but ... " Gina shook her head . She had known me in my really bad years . <p> When I got her answering machine , I asked , " Hi , Gina , did my double show up again ? " <p> She picked up . " Yes ! And he 's uncanny . He 's not you . But he 's close . He got into the theater today . We were rehearsing with new cast . He 's done it before . This time he got backstage . I actually spoke to him . He knows a lot about all of us . He wants to see you . Wants you to meet him at the theater . Gumshoe ! is dark tonight . But tomorrow , would you come ? Please ! " <p> She was afraid . " I 'll be there . " We made arrangements . " Gina , I 'm sorry this happened . " <p> " Hey , why the hell could n't he go up the street and haunt Phantom of the Opera ? " <p> Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to meet my Shadow next evening . I looked around at the French puppet theater , at the red American Flyer wagon filled with ABC blocks and made a note to begin an inventory . <p> Then , for a moment , I was aware of an unfamiliar room as pale as a ghost moon . On its floor was a mattress with my Shadow lying on it . His skin was tight over bones , his eyes hollow . My death mask . I thought of the time I lay on the bloody carpet while my Shadow cut a deal for both our lives . <p> As I locked up HALF REMEMBERED THINGS , I thought of the years that followed the bargain . They were like Tay 's stories of time spent in the World Under the Hill . Only glimmers remained . I walked across town piecing fragments together . <p> 7 . One night that I remember , I sat dealing in the Eatery , nicknamed the Speedery , across from the Fillmore East . At my table , a hip , stylishly androgynous neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured , " You need a gimmick that will keep a john 's attention ... " <p> Outside the window , a black Charger pulled up and beeped its horn . My Shadow nudged me , whispered , " Smiley-Smile . " I got up , walked past boys thin and brittle as wine glasses , past twitching , toothless old crank heads and the girl in a witch 's hat who revolved slowly outside the door . The guy with the slit mouth and dead eyes sat in the front seat of the car . I found it easier to look at the smile on his throat as we exchanged drugs and money then parted . <p> Back inside , I found my Shadow whispering to the kid , " ... Russian roulette . You must know about that . Your folks being Ukrainian . " The kid listened with such fierce devotion that I felt sick . <p> Another night , we walked , my Shadow and I , through the cavernous , deserted Newark train station . In a far corner , lights shone in one ticket window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us had any idea how we had gotten there . Then I saw a figure who seemed all silvery and flickering like a silent film . I felt my Shadow beside me suddenly snap to attention . <p> On a later night , in a junk haze , I rode through wintry streets in the back seat of a big car . My coat and shoes were gone . The heads of the driver and the man with him in the front seat flickered . Smiley-Smile shivered in a T-shirt between my Shadow and me . This time , his eyes were n't dead , they were wide and scared . When I looked , he screamed at me , " What the fuck are you staring at ? " <p> The Silent Movie figure beside the driver half turned to face us . That let me see the butt of the automatic in his jacket . I did n't know the make and did n't want to find out . " Shut up now , " he said and nothing more . It seemed that the guy beside me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , I 'd discover I was too . So I left everything up to my Shadow . <p> My next memory is of a white room and a guy around my age in a white tunic asking me my name . I tried to answer but found my mouth hurt too much . Besides , I did n't remember . Then he asked , " You know where you are ? " I shook my head and he said , " Roosevelt Hospital . In Hell 's Kitchen . In New York . Does any of that mean anything to you ? " It did n't . <p> " You were found with damaged nose cartilage , a couple of broken teeth and a three-inch gash above your left eye . Your skull was exposed . We practically had to close you up with bailing wire . It wo n't be pretty . You have a concussion . And amnesia . You know what that is ? " I was n't even curious . <p> Afterward , a gray-haired man in a baggy suit read from notes . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic Shipping And Transfer Building on Twelfth Avenue . You know where that is ? " I shook my head . <p> " Someone called the police to say there was trouble . The first officers on the scene found you face down in the elevator . The door was opening and closing on your head . You had no wallet , no I.D. , no coat , no shoes . You had opiates , amphetamine and alcohol in your system . Any idea how any of this happened ? " <p> Faces flickered in my memory . " Silent movie people , " I told the detective . He waited . But when I added nothing more , he closed his notebook . <p> A little later , someone said , " Kevin ! " Friends had found me . They brought back a lot . Relatives called and more memory returned . But everything . Out of the hospital , I crashed on peoples ' couches , stayed with Sarah , my girlfriend from college . <p> My nose was only a little bent , my teeth got fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red gash . The street had reached out and marked me . I thought of Scar Face my first time in the city , of old Smiley-Smile . What I saw in the mirror was a mug that would not look out of place in a gutter . <p> Life was flat except for a tantalizing sense that part of me was missing . One night on an East Village block lighted by a silvery city glow , a figure in a doorway said " Hello , Kevin . " And I remembered my Shadow . <p> " What happened in that cellar ? " I kept my distance . <p> " The Silent Film boys . Real nasty what they did to old Smiley . You were going to be next . I scared them off . " He stepped closer and I saw a scar just like mine . I knew he was lying about scaring anyone off . We had both come close to buying it . But when he held up a sheaf of glassine envelopes and said , " I got works . " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my collaboration . <p> 8 . I reminded myself of that as I arrived at the Cabrini Hospice , a few blocks north of my apartment . It was there that I practiced my part time job as an angel of death . <p> George 's sister Corrie was just leaving . She said , " A small seizure last night . I cut his nails . " We nodded , dry-eyed this close to the end . Corrie is his older sister . She and her husband are going to retire to the Yucatan . Their plans are on hold . <p> In the course of twelve years , I saw George through clinics and wards , support groups and marches . His will to live was a wonder . Now , finally , emaciated , small as a monkey , he lay on his left side with his eyes closed . Single , wirelike hairs still grew out of his head . Treatment for fungal growth made it seem his face had been scoured by fire . <p> I took his hands and rubbed them . It is felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world , retain the sensation of touch . He had been shaved . A tiny fleck of blood had dried on his chin . <p> Beside the next bed , an Italian woman in her sixties murmured over her dying son . Maybe she was saying the rosary , maybe she was talking to him , saying things she could n't while he was conscious . It 's what happened with me . All that evening , I sat with George , remembering , speaking softly . <p> " My life got saved by my bad heart and your good one , " I said . In the early eighties . I was the sick one . A couple of my valves gave out , delayed payment for the booze and drugs I 'd done years before . The illness and bypass operation took me out of circulation for a few years . <p> " You dragged me back to life when all I wanted was to die . You smuggled in tiny bites of forbidden desserts , took me to see Sundays in the Park . A very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two laughing . " George brought me back healthy to a world where he and everyone else had started to die . <p> It was late . The Italian woman had left . Rising to go , I leaned over George . " Back when we first met , I was n't sure it would last long . I feel it again , that this was just a stop on the way . But you are the very best . I hope I 've felt for you what humankind calls love . " <p> 9 . Two guys knelt on a mattress on the floor of a second-story room . The light was neon shining through the open windows . But I saw the tattoos . Matt Daniels , his body made liquid by junk , arched his back , leaned into the one behind him . <p> My Silent Partner wore only a sweatshirt and that hung off him . His legs were like sticks . I saw lesions . He stroked his partner 's back and got ready . Then he sat down and drew Matt to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rattle of the wheels on the tracks that brought my Shadow 's eyes back into focus . It was the burst of sparks from the trolley wire right outside the window . In that brief flash I saw his look of surprise , even of alarm . <p> At that I awoke . Lying in bed , with The Weather Channel on the screen . I remembered coming home from the hospice , getting a call from Eugene Sandler , eating supper , watching TV . I flicked it off and went into the living room . <p> Four in the morning is the Devil 's Matinee . It 's when human confidence is weakest and he whispers all our deepest doubts and fears . " Now , you know where Matt was last night , " said the voice which was also mine . " You and I were together a long time , Kevin boy . Everyone else is dead or dying . I 'm the only one who wants you . " <p> Always at such bad moments , I wanted to call Leo Dunn . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relic worn smooth by years of use . " Despite what Dunn may have told you , we 're not that different , " the voice whispered . <p> Out my window , in the park , leaves shimmered slightly , street lights gleamed off the back of Peter Stuyvesant 's statue . A figure sat absolutely still on a bench , For a moment , I thought it was a kid of maybe thirteen . On second glance I saw an adult , though maybe not male or human . This was the figure I had seen in the streetcar dreams . When I looked more closely it was gone . I kept watch but it did n't return . <p> With the dawn came a telephone call . " You awake , Kevin ? " It was Addle . " Come on up and have breakfast . " Within the hour , I sat in the back yard with my feet up , telling her and Lauren a lot of what had gone on . Lauren , who had n't heard about the Streetcar Dreams , asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " That I remember ? Way back . Maybe the Fall of ' 73 . I was in my late twenties and really strung out , living in this flea-bag hotel , the Victoria , up on the Square , pulling stupid , dangerous , penny-ante stuff . If I had n't been white , I 'd have been in jail . My Shadow ran my life . With my permission . I was like a zombie . <p> " Then , one night , I found myself in the Seventh Avenue IRT Station which was an arm pit even back then . I got on a streetcar , not questioning how that was possible . It burst out of the subway onto these World War Two era New York streets . Guys in uniform , women in hats , Buy Bonds posters . <p> " My father got killed in the South Pacific . He sailed from New York . Maybe that 's the connection . The next thing I knew , we had rolled into what looked like my old neighborhood in Boston . Compared to Hell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . I wondered why , since it was so easy to get to , I did n't just live here and commute to the Square ? <p> " Then I saw this kid , thirteen or fourteen , walking down the street . Suddenly , I knew if he turned , he 'd be me just before my Shadow poked into my life . That jolted me awake . <p> " But I wanted to go back . My Shadow was bothered , asked me what was wrong . The dream was something I knew about and he did n't . There was n't much of that , so I kept it a secret . " <p> Both Addie and I watched Lauren for her reaction . Checking her cameras and equipment , she asked , " Did having the dream change anything ? " <p> " My memories of those years are not real coherent , " I said , " But , yeah , I had the dream a few times . The next event in my life that I 'm sure of is that I gave my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So , it 's a lucky dream , " Lauren said and hefted her bags . " My Italian grandmother used to play the numbers . She had these Dream Books . " <p> " My Irish grandmother did too ! " I said . " I 'd forgotten Dream Books . Each dream had a three digit number . You had the dream ... " <p> " You looked up the number and played it . " She kissed Addie and me . " Streetcar Dream . Play it is my advice . " We were all laughing . " See you , Kevin . " <p> Addie saw Lauren off . When she came back , I was in the blue room looking at the toy trolley car , thinking about my Shadow . " Some of her hunches verge on the uncanny , " Addie said . Then she asked , " Do you want me to come with you to the theater tonight , Key ? " <p> " No . But thank you both so much for listening . I 've begun to understand something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not trying to have me locked up . " <p> " Not that the idea has n't crossed my mind . Laurie and I will be on call for George tonight so you wo n't have that to worry about . I 'll notify Cabrini . And I want to hear from you tonight after you do whatever you think you have to do . " <p> On the way out , I passed her first client of the day , a Latin kid , maybe ten , accompanied by a nanny . He looked straight ahead , walked like an automaton . <p> At the store , I updated the inventory lists . Tourists , a couple of young guys from Baden , drifted through . Later that morning , I got a call from Meg Briefly up at Masby 's . " You mentioned a collection for auction , Kevin . " <p> As we discussed that , Lakeisha came in with her headphones on , gave me a chill , dead-eyed look and went in back . A Haydn Quartet played on the radio . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the minuet . <p> Lakeisha was in the stock room , face on her arms , sobbing in great regular gasps . This would have to do with Lionel . I took out one of the earphones and said , " Men are pigs , honey . " <p> When she looked up , her eyes were awash . " Lionel said he saw you last night uptown following us . " I shook my head but felt a chill . " You closing this place ? " she asked with a hiccup . <p> " Probably . " I shrugged . " You 'll be going away to school . " <p> " What makes you think I 'm going ? " <p> " Because if we have to , your mother and I will stuff you in the trunk of a car and haul you up to Rhode Island . " I wondered if this was any different than my getting sent to Saint Sebastian 's . But Lakeisha stopped crying and seemed thoughtful . <p> Then a customer buzzed at the door . It was a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with the Hopalong Cassidy blanket in the window , " she told me , baffled . " His birthday is coming up . " <p> I nodded , discreet and worldly , a guy who would not come between a middle-aged man and his cowboy blanket . " The price is three hundred . " Her eyes widened . The past is always just a bit more expensive than we thought possible . We settled for two sixty-five . <p> As we boxed the woman 's purchase and saw her out of the store , I felt my Shadow very close . " How about lunch ? " I asked . Given a choice of anything from French Provincial to Shezuan Chinese within a two block radius , Lakeisha wanted McDonald 's . Over on Sixth Avenue , I had a salad , but I stole a couple of her fries . They were delicious . <p> " Kevin , you feeling okay ? " she asked . <p> " I 've got the life habit pretty bad , " I told her . <p> " Major commitment ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the day off . I did n't want my Shadow anywhere near her . <p> The air turned silvery and a thunderstorm moved across Greenwich Village , settling the dust and driving some tourists into the store . They looked around wide-eyed and left as soon as the rain stopped . All the while , I was aware of my Shadow 's dry heaves and throbbing spine , not pain but its evocation . <p> Then it was time to put on my jacket and tie , lock up the shop , hail a cab and go to meet the old Silent Partner . On the way , another thunderstorm , intense but tiny , moved uptown like it was part of the traffic . <p> It outran us as we passed Forty-Second Street . The evening sun slanted through Hell 's Kitchen and into Times Square . Theater marquees , the headlights of cabs and limos reflected off the wet , steaming pavement . <p> Cops , uniformed and plainclothes , were out on foot , in cars , and on horseback . The city is twisting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disney theme park . But between the cracks , I spotted trade and dealers , all races , all young , emerging from doorways as the rain passed . For those on the old and the new Deuce the theater crowd has always been like the nightly passage of a magic ship , lighted , loaded with riches , quick to vanish . <p> Gumshoe ! plays the Savoy , a nicely faded old house . This is n't the show about the fall of Saigon , or the singing alley cats who go to heaven on a manhole cover . It 's the one written by French people about the private eye in New York in the ' 30 's , the one where the blimp crashes on stage . <p> At the box office , I gave my name and almost immediately a voice at my elbow said , " This way , Mr. Grierson . " I turned to find a guy with the slightly puffy face of a retired cop giving me a slit-eyed stare . With my Shadow around , I 'd have to get used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down a few steps . Above us hung an old Manhattan skyline painted loud and flat . Spots dimmed and brightened and from the dressing rooms , a tenor ran the scales . The property manager and her assistant readied a bouquet of roses , a vast spangled bra and bright silver revolver . The security man opened a fire door and I followed him into an alley where Gina , all henna-wigged and kimonoed , stood among the company smokers . <p> " Tobacco Road ! " she said when she spotted me . We embraced carefully because she was made up and stepped away from the others . " He was in my dressing room . He knew everything . What went on at MAS . That time we found you in the hospital . Things we all said and did . It was so scary . He would n't let me leave until I promised to get you up here . Then he was just gone . " <p> She ground a butt under the toe of a purple sling-back . For just a moment I caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bother you again , " I told her and knew I had to make sure that was the case . <p> " Kevin , you 're wonderful ! " Maybe she too glimpsed that other country where we were still kids . <p> Then someone said , " Ten minutes , please , " and security led me to a seat in the orchestra . <p> " When my friend shows up , we 'll leave by ourselves , " I said . The cop nodded but did n't smile . The seat next to mine was empty . The house lights dimmed and the conductor brought down his baton . <p> The third year of a show is when the awards are won , the original stars are gone , the audience is tourists from Iowa and Okinawa . That evening , Gins , as the owner of a Times Square nightclub , gave it her considerable best . The dancers still strutted their stuff and everything was bright and loud . The plot involved a private eye , a taxi dancer and reincarnation . Once or twice I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't shown in the second act , when Gina and a Nazi spy had a nifty tango number . Then the blimp smashed into the Empire State Building . It was terrific . In the moment of silence before the reincarnated taxi dancer stepped out of the rubble into the arms of the detective , my Shadow said , " I made you sit through this as punishment . " He was back and I did n't tell him to disappear . <p> The main theme played for the dozenth time . " Let 's take a walk west . " We went up the aisle during curtain calls . Gina got a great hand . We hit the sidewalk and mingled with a phalanx of a theater party from Sunset Boulevard headed for Eighth Avenue . <p> " Like old times , huh , Key ? " A linen jacket that could have been one I 'd had ten or twelve years before hung stained and flapping around his bones . His hair was long , disordered . His eyes burned maliciously in a pale face . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out . Now I remember the things you forget . " <p> On Eighth , a remnant of the strip still jumps : porn shops , live action theaters , bang-and-walks for the love that just wo n't wait , tourist hotels for the discriminating out of town Suit John . " They want to call it Clinton , but it 's still Hell 's Kitchen and the Kitchen starts right here , " said my Shadow as we crossed Eighth and headed down a side street . <p> " Okay , you dragged me back here , " I said . " Any particular reason ? " <p> " I thought we 'd walk around the old neighborhood , savor some memories . " A couple of bars lighted the block . He looked back to see if we were followed , then slowed . " Your life without me was as stupid as that musical , " he said . <p> Ninth Avenue has become quite gentrified , all renovated walk-ups and ethnic restaurants , while retaining convenient clusters of drug dealers on every block . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish guys in a doorway discreetly noted my Shadow 's passing . They did n't see me at all . <p> I followed my Shadow into a liquor store where he pointed to a bottle behind a bulletproof shield and said , " Daddy , buy me that . " He stuck the pint of Wild Turkey in a jacket pocket as we turned west again . Halfway down the block , we stopped in front of a flight of cement stairs . They led to a brick alleyway and a door . " The site of Scar Face 's apartment is not exactly a big nostalgia stop for me , " I told him . <p> He faced the dark areaway . I heard a seal snap , saw him lift the bag to his mouth . I tasted old memory , felt a forgotten burning in my throat and chest . " I wanted to remind you of the trouble you get in without me , my boy . I followed you here like I did all those other times you sent me away . To make sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " That 's because you needed to keep me alive . It took a while to figure out . But without me , there is no you . " We continued west . On the blacktop of a park at Tenth Avenue , thin forms moved under the lights . I heard shouts , a laugh , the drum of a basketball . " Nice job you 're doing on poor Matt , " I Said . <p> " Matt 's a cute , talentless suburban kid . Do n't get sentimental . These days , tricks have the lifespan of dogs . " He led me across Tenth and down a block where teenage girls and their babies sat on tenement steps , past a high rise with a doorman and the old Grand Central Railway cut where far below , in pitch dark , a jungle whispered over rusting tracks . <p> No one else was on foot as we crossed Eleventh Avenue . I followed my Shadow down a side street lined with parked trucks and shadowy loading docks . At the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towers in New Jersey . My Shadow pointed and I looked up at the sign ATLANTIC SHIPPING AND TRANSFER . " This is where the cops found you that time , " he said . <p> " Remember the Silent Film People ? They 're smugglers . Not of this world . Smiley Smile crossed them somehow . They thought we did too . They had something nasty planned for the three of us . There are passages under these buildings that go God knows where . They dragged Smiley down one . We broke for it and they pistol-whipped you . " All of this sounded quite possible . <p> My Shadow popped a pill , raised the bottle . I gasped as he swallowed . " I stood them off , rang the bell until help came . Instead of running , I saved both our asses . " Now he was lying . We had both come close to buying it and he had n't saved us . The cops who got there in time to scare off the Silent Film People had been called by someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . Guys cruised for trade . A car with Jersey plates turned onto a side street . We went that way , past guys waiting in a vestibule . <p> My Shadow ignored them . " Ever think of how many in the family were , what should we call it ? Gifted ? I do n't mean just the ones with Shadows . Think of Aunt Tay . Remember those poems ? " <p> pre " Just we three go sailingMe , Myself and I " I was aware we were being followed . But he looked toward me for the next lines and I said : <p> pre " Over walls and fencesThrough the night we fly " " Second verse ! " he said , laid back his head and chanted : <p> pre " People half awakenHear us pass and pray " Someone whispered behind us . Instead of turning , I said : <p> pre " Out of fearing for our soulsWo n't we rest and stay " And suddenly no one was following us . Out of the corner of my eye , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . " Strong magic , " said my Shadow . " You ever ask yourself what the poem is about ? Like , if you 're me , and I 'm myself , then who is I ? Tay herself probably did n't know . " Our minds had been running along similar lines . I shut up and waited . <p> We stood outside a renovated building on Tenth . Years ago it had been a flophouse called Mother 's . While staying there I 'd discovered Mr. Dunn and left my Shadow forever . " Leo Dunn ! " my Shadow said . " He took all our sins and put them onto me . But assuming I 'm absolute Evil , how come you 're not exactly Good personified ? You ever wonder about that ? " <p> When I said nothing , he offered me a swig and chuckled when I shied away . After washing down a pain killer , he tossed the empty bottle in a trash can . Along with a contact wooziness , I caught an aching deep in my Shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . <p> " Right . Except the AIDS safety net is pretty frayed and you happen to be using the identity . Try walking into a hospital and saying , ' Hi , I 'm dying and I have no prior record of existence . ' I 'm tired , " he said . " I 'm always tired . And in pain too , of course . Walk me home . " <p> He headed west and I followed . " Any idea how you got sick ? " I asked . <p> " Mostly my time was one long doze . But you were n't exactly living your life to the full . I existed on your margins . On occasion I woke up and got real solid . People were doing drugs , screwing like it was going out of style . Which it was . Maybe I was n't real careful . All I know is that as I got sicker , I 've had trouble dozing out . Irony ! AIDS made me alive . " <p> We walked up a stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubs like an approach road to any American city . Everything was closed for the night . Trucks whizzed by . " Mostly , " he said , " I 've tried to stay out of your way . But this concerns you . After Mom died , her Shadow disappeared . No one saw Grandad 's double once he cooled . And it works the other way too . " <p> It was what I was afraid of . But I just shrugged . " You 're sure about that ? Substance and Shadow snuff out together ? " <p> " Yeah . I 'm sure . But there 's a possible escape . One thing I know . You and I are n't exact opposites . Like , say I 'm Death and Darkness . Then you should be Immortality and Light instead of just some poor fool scrambling to stay afloat . If we are Me and Myself in the poem , then I is a creature of Life and Goodness . " <p> A tenement stood alone among parking lots . Half its windows were tinned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building . " This is where I live . " <p> " Second floor , " I said , remembering my dream of the night before . <p> That surprised him . But he grabbed my wrist and said , " I need to use the identity while I look for number three . What has to happen is we go upstairs . Change clothes . Change places . You can fade out a little . I 'll be a better daddy than you ever were to me , make sure you get drugs and booze , your pick of the runaways . Refuse and I 'll fucking wreck your life . " <p> As he spoke , I summoned a memory of being a little kid staring down a subway tunnel for the first glimpse of a streetcar . Then , over my Shadow 's shoulder , I saw a single headlight . Above it , behind his window , floated the motorman . I waved and he smiled . My Shadow turned , then jumped away from me like he 'd been burned . <p> The car stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I told him , " I know the one you 're talking about . Maybe there are answers . I doubt if they 'll be ones we 'll like . I have a feeling I 'll find out very soon . Anyhow , I 'll take care of you . Tell Matt what it is you need . We 'll use him as a go-between . Other than that , stay away from my friends . " <p> My Shadow stared after me as the car swept away . My heart turned over at the sight of him sick and desperate and so close to being me . <p> On the car , the first passenger I saw was George . He looked as he had when we met twenty years ago . I knew he had died during the night without me present . I tried to say something and could n't . I sat down and he took my hand . " Look , " he said and pointed outside . In black and white were sailors and women , young and laughing , my parents among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself huddled on a mid-town corner , a scared runaway . Ten years later , scarred and red-eyed , I crossed the street on some bad errand . The car ran out of the night and into the dawn . I saw myself first in my thirties and then gray-haired striding on various missions . <p> When I looked around the car at everyone I had known and lost , I wanted to go and hold each one . I wondered if I too had died . If so it was n't so bad . " A Streetcar Named Death , " I said . George laughed and touched my face . I realized we had stopped . <p> The other passengers smiled as if amused at a befuddled friend who had gotten on the wrong car . The driver turned around . He was Leo Dunn . " Kevin , where the hell do you think you 're going ? " The door opened . " It is n't your time or your place . " <p> Then I found myself on the corner of my block . Fire engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The morning air was a sticky melange of exhaust , coffee , piss , burned toast , and garbage . <p> In front of my building stood Addle and Lauren , looking stricken . They 'd been told George was dead and now wondered what had befallen me . Lakeisha was crying . And sitting on the stairs , unknown to the others , was Matt , scared and strung out . <p> Then , walking toward them , I saw you watching over me like a guardian angel . Looking directly at you for the first time , my eyes teared and I started to draw deep sobbing breaths . <p> Epilogue Now it is evening and my friends have departed . Matt will fetch my Shadow as you wish . You sit in my house . Your face I see is not youthful but is rather untouched by time and this world . If Aunt Tay was right we will be off and away . If my Shadow 's hopes are realized you will save him . Whatever my own fate , I know I am lucky to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often survive in the world of man . And if we do it 's usually as drunks with glistening eyes , crazies , hooded figures in doorways in the rain . This morning most strangers who saw me crying in the street looked away and hurried past . But a few souls paused and pitied and wondered why . With your permission , this is for them . <p>  --  written in the city of New York <p> <p> By Richard Bowes <p>
