Contents2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # 1 <p> THERE WERE MANY GENIUSES at the Museum of the Mind , but Elliot Suskind was n't one of them . Stuffed away in a cluttered , windowless cubicle at the end of a dusty hall , he spent his days in quarantine , devising publicity events to call attention to the museum 's exhibitions . His job consisted largely of recycling adjectives : breathtakingly innovative , he called the exhibitions in his press releases  --  radiant , blinding , ingenious , and so on . Meanwhile , up and down the corridors of brightly-lit staff offices where the legitimate work of the museum was carried out , brilliance hung in the air as thick and fragrant as fog . Doug Escobar , for example , a neurobiologist who 'd recently been awarded a MacArthur grant to support his work on spinal fluid : brilliant fellow . What a head on that guy ! One door down from Escobar sat moody , preoccupied Arthur Wexler , a slump-shouldered physicist who 'd brought in a grant from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise dimensions : again , brilliant . And how about Ellen Watanabe , across the hall from Wexler , who just three weeks ago was eating her supper at the White House with all the other Rockefeller Foundation Fellows ? Was she brilliant , or what ? Suskind bad spotted her in a film clip on the evening news as he ate his takeout Stir-Fried Happy Family from the Chinese place around the corner : there she was , sitting under the glare of klieg lights , right next to the secretary of labor , probably chatting up a storm about prenatal brain growth as she nibbled at her blackberry sorbet . <p> Brilliant , that 's what they were , every one of them : brilliant , brilliant , brilliant . <p> Which was why , when Doug Escobar poked his head into Suskind 's cubicle about ten o'clock on a Monday morning in late spring , Suskind welcomed him with a tentative , bashful grin . No one had stopped by in several weeks , and lately he 'd begun to think  --  even to hope  --  that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forget that he was there . He did n't blame them , either . He was on his way OUT at the Museum of the Mind , and he knew it . His cubicle should have been cordoned off with orange tape from the Department of Health . <p> Escobar leaned against the porous fiberboard of Suskind 's cubicle and smiled briefly . " So , Elliot  --  we 're all waiting . " <p> " Waiting ? " <p> " The publicity on Remembering the Way  --  the navigation and memory show , " Escobar said . He pantomimed knocking on a door . " Hello ? Anybody home ? Talk to me . " <p> " Oh , yeah . Right . Sure . Of course . Remembering the Way  --  navigation and memory . " <p> " C'm on , Elliot . Wake up . We 're still waiting on the opening-day stuff . You know  --  the cheese . It came up again in this morning 's staff meeting . The guys upstairs thought it was in the can already . You 've blown every deadline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped up and ready to go two months ago . We 've given you one chance after another , Elliot . We open next Monday . So what 've you got to show me ? " <p> Suskind put down his Chronicle and straightened in his chair . " I 'm working on it , Doug-o , " he said , though that was more or less a lie . " I really am . I 'm going full steam ahead on this one . Gangbusters . Hold everything , stop the presses , full cheese ahead . " <p> " Next Monday . That 's exactly one week from now . " Escobar drummed his long , brilliant fingers on the doorjamb , apparently unamused . " You know how many days that is ? " <p> " Do n't tell me , " Suskind cried in mock desperation . " Let 's see ... it 's an odd number , " he said . Escobar turned abruptly and vanished . " Oh , come on  --  that was a joke , " Suskind called after him . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I was kidding before ! " <p> Everyone at the Museum of the Mind knew Suskind could n't tell his ass from his elbow , and they were n't very pleasant about it , either . Why could n't they give him pep talks and kid him playfully , like Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig did in Batboy for the Yankees , a novel he 'd read as a child ? Batboy for the Yankees followed the adventures of a fat kid who had no business being a batboy , no business at all , but was given a chance with the team anyway ; and thanks to the Babe 's manly encouragement , he made good . What an inspiring book ! So here he was , years later , Elliot Suskind , Batboy for the Brilliant Guys  --  only nobody was giving him any pep talks , and he certainly was n't making good . How could he ? After all , at heart he was still the same Suskind who 'd flunked high-school trigonometry  --  the same guy who 'd never been able to solve for x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and metamorphic rocks . Elliot Suskind , grown stout and bald at fifty : what right did he have to shoot the breeze with the staff of the Museum of the Mind : MacArthur grantees , fellows of the Rockefeller , Guggenheim , and Ford foundations , internationally known biophysicists and semioticians , neurobiologists and psycholinguists and geneticists  --  geniuses , every single goddamned one of them ? Last week in the men 's room he 'd taken a pee right next to an emaciated little guy in a pink shirt , who 'd been short-listed for the Nobel Prize in Physics . The Nobel Prize ! <p> For over a decade now , Suskind had observed them day after day in silent awe , sighing hopelessly in the face of their radiance as he went about his pedestrian business , the hack work of his job . Once , long ago , he had reveled in the thrill of their company ; but now he shriveled in their presence , done in by the knowledge that for every one of them there were a hundred , a thousand , ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bell curve , all the run-of-the-mill schmucks out there who did n't have a clue . <p> Stuart Wisotsky 's presence did n't make things any easier . Wisotsky , a noted pain-perception expert ( the Wisotsky , in fact  --  as in The Wisotsky Ladder of Pain ) , dropped by Suskind 's cubicle at least once a week to poke him in the shoulder and ask , " Did that hurt ? " If Suskind did n't respond , Wisotsky would poke him harder and demand , " Did that ? " Then he 'd taunt him with questions like , " Tell me how neurons work , Elliot . Come on , this is a science museum , you should know this , any schoolboy should know this . It 's in The World Book . It 's on Sesame Street , for God 's sake . Did n't they teach you anything in college ? You did go to college , did n't you ? Tell me about neurons . Tell me about synapses . Say something chatty about the medulla oblongata . Anything at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  have n't got a clue . I 'm too stupid , " Suskind would say with an engaging smile . <p> The truth was , Suskind wished he knew about neurons and synapses . Who would n't , in his situation ? He wanted to be able to hold his own when the subject of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials arose in conversation . He would have loved to throw in a remark or two about the latest developments on the aphasia and apraxia fronts . He might as well have tried to fly . <p> As a child Suskind had been besieged by curiosity . He would store up ponderous and pressing questions all day long , and when his father pulled into the driveway after a long day at the shoe store , little Elliot would meet him by the garage and pour his heart out : Why does a week have seven days , Dad ? What happened before time started ? Hey , Dad , why do the hands of a clock turn clockwise ? Where 's the end of the universe ? Listen , Dad , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of a map ? Suskind Senior would listen to his son 's questions , looking at him in mournful silence for a minute , and then announce , " Do I look like I know ? " <p> But there was no use blaming his father . The poor man sold women 's shoes for a living , for God 's sake  --  how was he supposed to know why the hands of a clock turn clockwise ? Suskind 's father spent a career  --  a lifetime  --  peering hopefully up one skirt after another , and when he died at the age of seventy-two , he was still at it , on his knees as always , felled by a heart attack as his arthritic fingers strained to fit a pair of pumps . ' " Sonuvabitch , " he said softly , and then his head pitched forward like a coconut right into his last customer 's lap . <p> No , the fault was Suskind 's own , he was the reason his life had tumbled into the toilet . There was no mystery as to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one mistake , just one !  --  but there was no point in rehashing all that now . As doddering old Rabbi Futterman had once told Suskind 's Hebrew-school class , If the mistake you make is bad enough , one is all it takes . As it happened , Rabbi Futterman was referring to Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden , but at age nine , Suskind had taken the warning personally , and for years afterward had worried obsessively about making the one mistake bad enough to be all it took , constantly questioning himself and looking over his shoulder uncontrollably . And then , when the moment finally came , he was n't even watching . <p> Once , long ago , he 'd had a family : a wife named Brenda , a son named Nick . Then Suskind made a mistake : he let go of Nick 's hand for a brief moment . And Suskind 's wife and child went away forever . Oh , Futterman , Futterman , did you have to be so right ? <p> This was ten years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Saturday in early December , Suskind took him downtown on the N-Judah for a morning stroll through Union Square : Nordstrom 's , I. Magnin 's , Macy 's , and the rest were having pre-Christmas sales . Traffic was terribly congested , the sidewalks choked and menacing , panhandlers everywhere , throngs of tourists from every corner of the globe yakking in a host of languages and gesticulating wildly , moving in tight-packed herds . In the clamor Suskind grew rattled , yanking Nick across tense intersections , lifting him by one arm like an awkward sack of groceries despite the boy 's insistence that he wanted to walk . Horns honked , bleating their protests through the bedlam . Suskind held Nick 's tiny hand firmly but tenderly as they threaded through the hordes ; they were headed toward a toy store in Maiden Lane where Nick had once seen , he was sure of it , the biggest stuffed bear in the world  --  and then , in Wilkes-Bashford 's windows on Post Street , a camelhair blazer caught Suskind 's eye , and he stopped short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part around him . He 'd stared at the jacket a good minute  --  no , thirty seconds at the most  --  before he realized in a heartbeat of panic that his son had drifted away from his grip . He shouted Nick 's name into the crisp air , ran down the sidewalk like a madman , pushing people out of his way . <p> A desperate hour later , they were reunited in the lobby of a seedy , sour-smelling police station on Sansome , a few blocks north of Chinatown . Suskind swept his son into his arms , pressed his face into the boy 's coat and cried for several minutes . At first he cried out of love for his son ; then he realized uneasily that he was crying because he was moved by his own tears . Meanwhile Nick ran a hand through Suskind 's thinning hair , a gesture as gentle as the brush of a bird 's wing , and murmured , " Do n't cry , Daddy . Do n't cry . " <p> They rode home in a taxi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pushed to the brink and then snatched back again . But when he told Brenda this miraculous tale  --  miraculous , yes , because it seemed amazing and wonderful that in the midst of those crowds he 'd been reunited with Nick , the boy unhurt and smiling and calm  --  she did n't see it quite that way . Moments later , in fact , working in a silent , white-lipped panic , she was packing two bags  --  one for her , a smaller one for Nick . The veins in her neck pulsed as she stalked from one room to another , hurling clothing into the suitcases , snatching pictures from the walls , utterly impervious to Suskind 's entreaties . <p> In a bitter phone conversation the week after her departure , he pleaded for another chance . " To do what ? " Brenda cried . " To kill our only child ? You want me to give you another whack at it , so you can drop him down a manhole this time ? Put him in the garbage disposal ? Look , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're sorry , but sorry does n't do it , sorry 's not enough . " Her voice broke . " What if they had n't found him , " she sobbed , barely able to get the words out . " You want another chance ? Well , there are n't any other chances . Get a lawyer . " <p> She 'd only moved across the bay to Walnut Creek , but it might as well have been Bucharest . Over the past ten years , relations between them had settled into a state of protracted trench warfare , punctuated by a series of feints and flank movements , with Nick playing the role of Belgium , a piece of hotly-contested , heavily-bombed real estate between them . In the end Brenda was the wilier , and so Suskind was left at long last with little more than an album of dog-eared , poorly-focused snapshots and  --  gathering dust in a drawer  --  a manila envelope full of unused , nonrefundable tickets to whale-watching expeditions ; Warriors , Giants , and A 's games ; Alcatraz tours ; zoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fifteen now , a wide-hipped , disaffected boy with a nose stud and an amazing capacity for boredom . To Suskind , he 'd turned into a stranger  --  which was n't surprising , considering that they 'd spent no more than an occasional weekend in each other 's company for ten years . The Nick he knew  --  the only son he really had  --  lived only in Suskind 's memory : a kindergarten boy , still soft-skinned and smelling faintly of oatmeal and raisins  --  the sad-eyed little fellow who 'd stroked his head so sweetly all those years ago . <p> 2 Suskind glanced at his watch : nearly ten-thirty already . One week to go  --  this was ridiculous . He 'd known about Remembering the Way for months , of course , and had done nothing . How had he allowed this to happen ? He tried to focus his thoughts , scrambling through the rubble of his imagination for ideas : navigation and memory , memory and navigation  --  remembering where you 've been so you can get back there someday . He got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a file drawer , wound them up , and let them march single file off the top ledge of his cubicle into a wastebasket . One by one they waddled to their deaths , and Suskind provided a tiny scream for each as it fell . <p> Christ , what did he know about navigation and memory ? He got lost whenever he left the city , even just going over the bridge to Berkeley . And what was the big deal about memory , anyway ? OK , so it was nice to know where he 'd left his car keys . And sure , no question about it , it came in handy if you were playing Trivial Pursuit . But why in the name of God should he have to remember with such devastating clarity the soft , sweet joy of holding Nick in his arms for the first time ? Better to live with amnesia , the past a blank wall behind you . Why recall in such meticulous detail the stab of terror as he realized his hand was empty , that Nick 's little fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relive that awful moment ? All it did was make him miserable  --  and that , Suskind had decided , was the fundamental role memory played in his life : it was the spring out of which his tragedies flowed ; it reminded him of all he 'd had , and all he 'd lost , and who he 'd been when he and the worm were whole . <p> One feature of Remembering the Way was going to be a maze for children  --  the carpenters in the museum 's workshop were almost done with it . Maybe the grand opening could incorporate some version of the maze , Suskind mused . That might be fun . He spent a few minutes doodling , trying to position a miniature maze on the museum 's front lawn , where most grand openings took place . But then suddenly the picture grew dark ; he envisioned a small army of hysterical kids getting lost in it , their angry parents storming the doors . No , no , not a chance , he told himself a moment later , and threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geniuses , deal with the lawsuits . <p> Escobar would be back tomorrow , standing in the doorway of Suskind 's cubicle , tapping his brilliant fingers against the jamb  --  and he 'd be back again the day after that , too . And if Suskind did n't come up with something by Wednesday , he 'd probably be out on his ear . This was the eleventh hour . There would be no more second chances this time , no more Stuart Wisotsky coming to poke him in the shoulder and give him grief , no more taking a pee next to pink-shifted Nobel shortlisters . He shut his eyes and saw his job like a ship sailing out of a harbor , smoke rising from its stacks , confetti streaming in the air . Good-bye , job ! Bon voyage ! Fifty and finished . Brenda had warned him repeatedly : she had friends in the court system who would make sure that if he lost this job and fell behind on his child-support payments , he 'd see Nick again when hell froze over . Brenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried up and blown away years ago . In fact at times she seemed almost to like him , though he knew it was a dry and dusty sort of affection  --  the fossilized imprint of something dead . But none of that really mattered , she 'd reminded him more than once . Bitterness , love : these were luxuries she could n't afford . She had bills to pay  --  that 's what mattered . She depended on his financial support to keep Nick clothed and fed . <p> The phone rang in his cubicle , snapping him out of his gloom , and he answered it at the third ring . " Mr. Suskind ? " a woman 's voice asked . " This is U.C. Med Center calling . Dr. Stanley Agron asked us to call you . Dr. Agron is your mother 's cardiologist . Your mother 's in intensive care right now . " <p> " My mother ? Oh , no . What 's wrong ? What happened ? " Not now , he thought  --  I do n't have time for this now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The doctors are waiting for test results , Mr. Suskind . I 'm sure Dr. Agron would be glad to speak to you about your mother 's condition . He 's still with patients right now . " <p> " Her condition ? What condition ? I had dinner with her a week ago  --  she was fine , " Suskind said , then sagged into the receiver , admitting to himself that fine was stretching it a bit . OK , so she 'd seemed somewhat livelier than a month before  --  but eighty-three was eighty-three , after all , and his mother 's dancing days were behind her . Sure , she 'd kept up a raspy patter throughout their meal , regaling him with the ongoing saga of her Hadassah group ( their latest luncheon ; how much they 'd raised for the hospital in Israel ; how Hilda Feingold 's daughter-in-law , the shiksa , had just redecorated the living room ) , then quizzing him as always on the wretched fine points of his life . And yes , her appetite had picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd managed to make her way through half her plate ... but then she fell asleep in the car and snored as he drove her home , and when he grabbed her arm to steady her as she got out , the flesh above her elbow had no substance ; it felt dead  --  feathery and soft , like cool linen over jello . <p> As it turned out , she 'd had a stroke . " Something medium to large , " Dr. Agron told him an hour later in the damp , dim waiting room outside intensive care ; and Suskind , unable to stop himself , remembered his late father , the shoe salesman , and pictured the stroke as a size 10 1/2 D in cordovan . " We 'll wait a day or two , see how she 's responding , " Agron continued . " My guess is she probably aspirated some food . Tomorrow morning we 'll get some tests back that 'll tell us a lot . My guess , she had a heart attack , too . Enzymes 'll tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're giving her medication to take the fluid off . " <p> " Congestive heart failure ? Oh , Christ . Goddammit , " Suskind said disgustedly , as if the whole thing might have been Dr. Agron 's fault . <p> " It 's something she 's been flirting with now for a couple of years . We 've been doing everything we could . But given your mother 's age , and her history of heart disease . . . " Dr. Agron smiled and shrugged , then put a hand on Suskind 's shoulder . The doctor was a beak-nosed little guy with an enormous dowager 's hump under his white lab coat . Hell , man , Suskind thought , do something about that hump , why do n't you ? You 're such a good doctor ? OK , so fix it ! Who wants a guy who looks like Quasimodo working on his mother ? <p> After Agron said good-night , Suskind listened to the doctor 's heels clicking away down the linoleum corridor , beating a gay tattoo like a tap-dancer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lay propped up in her bed  --  asleep or comatose , who knew ? Intravenous units were dripping clear liquids into her forearms , both of which were already blooming with black bruises . A forest of monitors surrounded her , beeping and whooshing and ticking . Her teeth were out , and her face was changed utterly by the lack of them  --  shrewder , almost mischievous  --  like one of those leprechaun faces carved out of dried apples that were sold at craft fairs . He realized he 'd never seen her this way before . Fifty years old , and he did n't know what his own mother looked like ! Her mouth fell open in a snore , and as the overhead light caught her chin , he saw a sparse cluster of whiskers there . My God , he told himself with a sigh , you live your whole life with dignity , even heroism  --  then at the end , this is what happens to you . <p> " Oh , I 'm glad you made it over tonight . Let me have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him said , and Suskind whirled from his mother 's bedside . A small , bearded , bespectacled man stood with his hat in his hands , silhouetted in the rectangle of light flooding through the door . It was  --  could it be ?  --  old Rabbi Futterman : Jacob Futterman , the man who 'd driven him kicking and screaming through the lessons leading up to his bar mitzvah . <p> " Hello , " Suskind said , as much a question as a greeting . <p> " Good evening to you , also . Look at you , all grown up . You 've lost your hair , " Rabbi Futterman said , and moved closer . But no , it could n't be . Futterman had been an elderly man , frail and saintly , already well past retirement age when Suskind stood at the bimah , reading his Torah portion  --  and that was thirty-seven years ago . The man would have to be close to a hundred now . No  --  a decade past it , maybe more . <p> " Rabbi Futterman ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Who else ? " the rabbi softly replied . He set his hat carefully on the edge of a small table . <p> " Rabbi Futterman  --  my gosh . I have n't seen you in ages , " Suskind said , and felt suddenly ashamed . " I had no idea you were still around . I thought you were probably  --  retired by now . You know . After all these years . " <p> " You thought I was dead , " Rabbi Futterman said lightly . " I would n't blame you . I 'll tell you the truth : sometimes I think I 'm dead , too . " <p> Suskind smiled lamely . " Well , I know the feeling . " <p> " I 'm semiretired , " the old man admitted . " But I do n't want to give it up completely . You know the old Yiddish saying ? The hardest work is to go idle . It 's true . Rabbi Mink does the Saturday morning service now . You have n't met Rabbi Mink  --  no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tells me his suits cost six hundred dollars . They 're Italian . Can you imagine that ? You should see these suits  --  they 're very nice . He drives a German car . " The old man shrugged . " But I like Rabbi Mink . He handles all the bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs and the weddings . The kids love him . And I do the funerals , the hospital visits . At my age it 's appropriate  --  like a dress rehearsal , I tell myself . So what about you ? I have n't seen you in ages , Elliot . You do n't go to shul with your mother ? " <p> " No . I fell away from it , I guess you could say . Over the years , kind of . You know  --  one thing and another . I got so busy at work . Maybe that was it . " Suskind ran a hand over the nubby white bedspread covering his mother 's legs . What was he supposed to say to this old man ? What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What kind of work do you do ? Do you mind my asking ? " <p> So Suskind explained his job at the Museum of the Mind . He did n't have the energy to go into it very deeply . He briefly described Remembering the Way . " You should come see it , " he told Rabbi Futterman . " You might like it . It 'll be opening in a week . If I can figure out the publicity , that is . That 's my job  --  the cheese , they call it . " <p> " Ah , well . The cheese . It sounds very important . Well , it 's wonderful to see you , Elliot . God bless you . I should be going now . My doctor tells me I should be in bed by eight , but who listens to doctors ? Before I go , pray with me for just a moment . " It came out halfway between a question and a demand , and before Suskind could reply , the rabbi had laid a gnarled hand on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunched over and rocked slightly as he chanted , and Suskind found himself hunched and rocking , too . <p> Later that night Suskind phoned Brenda and told her the news . " I 'm sorry , Elliot , " she said in an aggrieved voice , as if the call might be an accusation . <p> " Oh , do n't be sorry , " he told her . " She 's eighty-three . It was bound to happen . " <p> " Do n't tell me not to be sorry , Elliot . I said I was sorry , so let me be sorry . " <p> " Brenda . Please . Not now . " <p> " You caught me at a bad time . It 's been one of those days . One of those months . " She paused . " So what are they telling you ? About your mother , I mean . " <p> " They do n't know yet . They 're waiting on test results . I can call back another time if you 'd like . " <p> " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could hear her lighting a cigarette  --  the flick of the lighter , then her sharp intake of breath , and then the exhale , long and smooth . <p> " You 're smoking again ? " <p> " You know , " she said a moment later , " you 're not the only one with regrets . " <p> " I know that . " <p> " No , you do n't . You think you have a monopoly on regrets , Elliot . You think everybody else strolls along through life as happy as a dog with a stick , and meanwhile you 're the sensitive one , the one looking back and wishing things could have turned out differently . Elliot Suskind , The One With All The Regrets . " <p> She 'd been drinking ; he could tell from her cadence , the way her sentences rose and fell . She was romantic when she was a little drunk . One night three years ago he 'd taken her to dinner in the city to celebrate a promotion she 'd received at work ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a glass of wine with her sand dabs , and over coffee she leaned across the table and kissed him full on the lips  --  the first time she 'd done that since she 'd walked out the door . <p> " Are you OK ? " he asked . <p> " Do n't ask . " <p> " How 's Nick ? How 's he doing ? " <p> " Oh , terrific . He talks back . He 's flunking two classes . I do n't know him anymore . " <p> " Let me talk to him , OK ? I 'll see what 's going on . " <p> " He hangs out with trash . Last week he was caught shoplifting at Tower Records . " <p> " Oh , Christ . Shoplifting ? Are they going to prosecute ? " <p> " It 's his first offense . They have this diversion program . He has to go in on Monday and apologize to the manager . Then he has to do some community service . Sweeping streets , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of my rope with him . " <p> " Let me talk to him , Brenda . C'm on . Put him on the phone . I 'm his father . " <p> " He 's at the movies with a bunch of his shitty little friends . " <p> " All right  --  will you tell him I called ? I want to talk to him . He should know about his grandmother . Maybe he could call her up or something . He 's old enough to get involved . " <p> " He 's a baby , Elliot . I mean , I see your point  --  but he does n't even know your mother . How often have they seen each other ? She sends him a card a couple times a year with a check for twenty-five dollars . She has n't raised it in ten years . " Brenda fell silent then , and Suskind could hear her blowing smoke into the telephone for a few moments . Then she murmured , " I 'm sorry . I 'll give him the message , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hope she  --  " <p> " Yeah . Well , thanks , " he muttered . " And I 'm sorry Nick 's been giving you problems . Shoplifting  --  Christ , maybe we should go for family counseling or something . You know  --  to get some professional help . We 're a family , are n't we ? I mean , sort of , anyway . " <p> But Brenda did n't answer . Instead , without a good-bye , she softly hung up the phone . <p> 3 As happened so often , the walls of his apartment began to close in on him after his talk with Brenda , and so Suskind went out for a late bite to eat . At Yet Wah , the Chinese place around the corner , he sat at a small table by the window and ordered a bowl of hot and sour soup , a small plate of pot stickers , and a platter of lo mein with scallops in a spicy ginger-garlic-scallion sauce . He was slurping the soup when Randy , his downstairs neighbor , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ array of tattoos , shambled in and was seated back by the kitchen . Randy had moved in over a year ago , and though Suskind had tried to make small talk with him a few times , the kid had n't proved to be much of a conversationalist . For one thing , there was the safety pin in Randy 's tongue , which Suskind imagined made it difficult to say much more than hello . Besides , the kid seemed genuinely shy . The few times they 'd run into each other in the dank , odoriferous lobby of their building , Randy had merely mumbled a few apologetic phrases and excused himself , swaying all the while , like a flagpole in a strong wind . When he was n't pedaling around the city delivering packages ( he was a bicycle messenger , Suskind had gathered during their brief exchanges ) , Randy hung out at his apartment listening to unimaginably bad music , cranking it up so that Suskind was often forced to flee into the clamor of Clement Street just to get a little peace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive doses of illegal drugs down there . He probably spent half his paycheck every week having new parts of his body pierced , paying good money to strangers to have a cowbell attached to his penis . <p> But none of that mattered at the moment . It was ten o'clock at night , and Suskind 's son was at the movies with his trashy friends , probably plotting a bank heist at this very moment ; his mother was dying , his job was in the crapper  --  and so he could n't eat alone right now . He could n't sit by himself ; his own presence at the table was too oppressive to bear . So Suskind rose and waved his napkin in Randy 's direction . The kid gazed back stolidly for several seconds , a glazed and solemn expression stamped on his face ; then he smiled and approached Suskind 's table . " Hey , it 's you ! It 's Upstairs Dude . How you doing ? I 've never seen you here before . You eat here a lot ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? No point of both of us eating alone . " <p> Randy sank into a chair . " This is something , " he said . " I was thinking about you yesterday , man  --  last night , really . Was my music too loud again ? I mean really , be honest . " <p> " Last night ? Oh , I do n't know , " Suskind said . " How loud is too loud ? " Of course it had been too loud . Who was he kidding ? The floor of his apartment had thumped until three in the morning . He 'd watched the floorboards vibrating , and he could have sworn they jumped with each beat . But what was the point in saying anything now ? <p> " Man , I 'm working on it  --  honest , " Randy said , and shook his head . " I 'm trying to get it under control . But it 's hard . You know what I mean ? It 's very hard . " <p> Suskind smiled and nodded , imagining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a battle for control of the volume knob . " Oh , that 's OK , " he said . <p> " You look beat , man . You mind me saying that ? " Randy asked . <p> Suskind 's pot stickers came just then , and Randy eyed them with tender admiration . " Go right ahead , " Suskind said , and slid the plate across the table . " They 're very good here . " <p> " Hey . Thank you , " Randy said . He discreetly removed the pin from his tongue , then tucked two dumplings into his mouth . " Oh  --  oh . These are incredible , " he moaned , pounding the table gently with a fist . " Man . Ah . Oh , yes . Oh , yes . " He pushed the plate back toward Suskind . " Go ahead , man . Try one . They 're dynamite . " He watched with a soft smile as Suskind ate . " So hey , " Randy said . " Upstairs Dude . Tell me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Eh , " Suskind replied . " I 've been better . My mother 's sick , she 's in the hospital . Eighty-three years old . I like her a lot . She 's up at U.C. Med Center . You ever been there ? " <p> " Oh , no . Oh , man . Hospitals  --  no way . That 's awful , man , " Randy said . He screwed his face up until it looked like a prune . <p> " And then at the same time I 'm screwing up royally at work . I 've got this project that 's not going anywhere . If I do n't solve it in a week , I 'll lose my job . Really I 've only got a couple of days , at this point . I 've known about it for months , and I just have n't been able to get anything done . I 've been feeling sort of rotten lately , you know ? Just sort of down in general . So anyway , the way it looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what . They 've had it with me , and I do n't really blame them . And if I lose my job , my ex-wife is going to make it so I ca n't see my kid at all . I 'm sure of it . " He picked another pot sticker off the plate and examined it briefly before popping it into his mouth . " Other than that , " he said , " everything 's just peachy . " <p> " Whoa . That 's some load , " Randy said . " That is some regulation bone-banger shit . " He shook his head and squirmed in his seat . " So  --  what kinda project is it ? " he asked . The lo mein came , a mountain of it , and now there was no hesitation between them ; Suskind asked the waiter for an extra plate , and when it arrived he put half the noodles onto it and passed it across the table . As they dug in he explained his job at the Museum of the Mind , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more gusto than he 'd been able to summon for Rabbi Futterman . Randy ate with utter abandon as he listened to Suskind 's tale of woe , dousing his food with hot chili oil and soy sauce , using first chopsticks , then a fork , and finally his fingers to hoist the noodles to his mouth . <p> He was silent for a while after Suskind finished his explanation . At last he smiled broadly and said , " Hey  --  you know what ? I think I might be able to solve your problem , man . " <p> " Oh , yeah ? What did you have in mind ? " Suskind asked . " You think maybe you could get me a job as a bike messenger ? I can ride a bike  --  honest . OK , so I 'm a little fat . But still . " <p> All that was left of the platter was a small pool of sauce ; Randy dragged an index finger through it , then lifted the finger delicately to his lips and sucked on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this , " he said , and leaned across the table conspiratorially . <p> 4 " A race , " Suskind said to Doug Escobar at nine o'clock the following morning . He sat at the edge of his chair in Escobar 's office , beating a syncopated rhythm out on his knees . " That 's my big idea for our openingday celebration  --  a bicycle race across San Francisco . A whole crew of bike messengers . You 've seen them around town  --  they 're crazy , they 're daredevils , they 'll do anything . I happen to know one , which is how I came up with this . I 'm meeting with the management of one of the delivery firms today , to get the ball rolling fast . These guys are in fantastic shape  --  they pedal uphill all over the city . They 're maniacs . They love racing . Lots of them compete in the race circuit when they 're not working . A couple of them are in training for the Tour de France , for Christ 's sake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bike race that 'll force them to follow complicated routes through the city . Fiendishly complicated  --  that 's the phrase . I love it  --  fiendishly complicated  --  do n't you ? I 've never used that one before . They 'll have to navigate their way  --  we 'll throw up roadblocks , make them go in circles , send them all over the place . The finish line will be on the front lawn of the museum . Balloons , popcorn , hot dogs for the kids . So  --  Voila ! Our big event for the opening day of Remembering the Way . Well  --  what do you think ? " <p> Escobar looked up from the computer flow chart spread across his desk and slipped his reading glasses off his nose . " These bike messengers  --  they 're insured through their employers ? " <p> " Absolutely . " <p> Escobar raised his eyebrows and smiled faintly . " Brilliant , " he said at last . <p> Brilliant ? Had Escobar just called one of Suskind 's ideas brilliant ? He 'd never done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's idea ; it was Randy 's . But still . Brilliant . <p> " Oh , thank you , " said Suskind breathlessly . <p> " Au contraire  --  thank you , " Escobar replied , and flashed a wan smile as Suskind bowed his way backwards out of the office , bumping into chairs and toppling a table lamp as he went . <p> Back in his office , Suskind called Mercury Deliveries , Randy 's employer , and asked to speak to a woman named Temple , the supervisor and dispatcher for the firm 's messengers . She also handled community outreach programs , Randy had told him  --  Temple , he said , handled everything . Her voice had the tonal quality of a circular saw biting into concrete , and Suskind , grimacing , had to bold the receiver several inches from his ear . " Museum of the Mind , eh ? " Temple said . " I saw one of your exhibits a couple of years ago . It was n't my kind of thing  --  but then , I 'm hard to please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've always been this way . I lack generosity , I 'm cold and unforgiving , I 've got the heart of a snake . Now what 's on your mind ? " <p> Suskind launched hesitantly into the same spiel he 'd just given Escobar . It left him winded , and he sat breathless when he was finished , waiting for her response . <p> " This is Randy 's idea , is n't it , " Temple barked . " That little pinhead is always coming up with schemes like this . He 's a troublemaker and a liar , and he 's been nothing but grief for me ever since he walked in the door . I wish he 'd get hit by a bus . No , wait , that 's too harsh . I wish he 'd just go away  --  let him work for somebody else for a change . See how they like it . " She paused . " But in spite of all of that , I 'll consider going along with this ridiculous idea . I did n't say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and I 'll tell you why . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Because I 'm a big woman , that 's why . Sometimes I think I 'm too big . " <p> " Well , I 'm glad you are , " Suskind said fervently , as if he 'd been asked to vote on the matter . " Now , can we talk specifics ? Logistics ? I really need to be up and running on this . " <p> " Thursday , noon , " she snapped . " My office . Bring along your proposed routes . I 'll look them over , give you a quick thumbs-up or thumbsdown , and that 'll be the end of it . " <p> " Any chance we could get together before then ? I 'm just awfully anxious to get  --  " <p> " Thursday noon . Come over here any sooner than that , I 'll bite your head off . " <p> " I have a feeling we 're going to get along just great , " Suskind said , and quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital to see his mother and found Dr. Agron at her bedside . Slats of sunlight streamed in through the blinds , striping the sheets and turning them , in Suskind 's eyes , into a gigantic prayer shawl , like the oversized , shroudlike ones worn , when Suskind was a boy , by the old men of his synagogue  --  trembling , rheumyeyed old cockers , refugees from Europe 's horrors . He stepped back toward the doorway . " Here 's what we 've got , " Agron told him sotto voce , clicking his mechanical pencil in and out . " First we 've got a stroke  --  maybe because she aspirated some food , maybe not , still hard to tell . Then we 've got a heart attack . And now we 've got pneumonia on top of it all . " He grasped Suskind 's shoulder and guided him into the hallway . " Look , I 'll be straight with you  --  your mother and I go back , I know her now for over forty years  --  she 'd want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be . God bless her , she 's not in a good situation . With the pneumonia and the rest of it , we may need to put her on a respirator pretty soon . I want to warn you , though  --  you put her on , it might be hard to get her off it . I do n't think she 'd want to go on the machine , but we do n't have a signed living will , so we 're probably going to have to go ahead and do it  --  unless you tell us not to . It 's your call . " <p> " What are you saying ? What 's my call ? " <p> " We 're giving her diuretics to get the fluid off her lungs , but we run the risk of dehydrating her . We 're doing what we can to control her blood pressure , but it keeps jumping all over the place . The stroke  --  well , what can I tell you ? If we 'd caught it within seven to ten hours , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " What 's my call ? " Suskind repeated in a louder voice . " What am I supposed to be deciding here ? " <p> Agron shrugged . " We start her on blood thinners , we 're liable to get her involved in some internal bleeding , which is all we need right now . We do n't give her blood thinners , she 'll have another stroke . You see what I 'm getting at here ? " He dropped his hand from Suskind 's shoulder and slumped . His hump seemed to swell just then , as if it were inflatable , like a balloon . " You 're her son  --  you decide . " <p> " Decide what ? OK , I 'm her son  --  but I 'm in public relations ! You 're her doctor  --  you 're supposed to make the call ! I do n't know what the hell you 're supposed to do . That 's why you have the white coat and I do n't . " <p> Just then a gaggle of lab-coated interns and residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they walked . Dr. Agron looked at his watch , clapped Suskind on the shoulder blade , and muttered something vaguely encouraging that Suskind did n't quite catch . Then he joined the parade as it moved slowly down the wide passage . Suskind watched Agron 's hump receding down the hall under the bright lights . <p> His mother 's eyes were open when he walked back into her room , and she smiled at him . He clasped one of her hands ; her soft , plump fingers closed around his thumb and squeezed it . " Hey , you 're up , " he said . " Welcome back . Where 've you been , stranger ? Where 'd you go ? " <p> " Tartakow , " she whispered . Then her eyes shut again . <p> She 'd gone looking for Tartakow twelve years ago , at the tail end of a Hadassah-sponsored tour of Eastern Europe . Newly widowed , still spry and feisty , she 'd insisted on looking for it  --  the miserable shtetl her parents had left at the turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be nearby  --  right in the neighborhood  --  and who knows when I 'll be back that way again ? I want to see it . Alex Haley went back to Africa  --  so I 'm going to Tartakow , " she said . " It 's my roots . " And so while everyone else on the tour stayed in Warsaw and enjoyed a stunning evening of ballet and a special farewell banquet in the great hall of the Zecheta Gallery , Miriam Suskind took the train to Lublin and then rented a car , a tin can with a manual shift , and headed into the rolling grasslands of the Polish countryside , searching for the remains of the wretched little town from which her parents had fled . <p> Weeks later , back home in San Francisco , she regaled her son over the phone with the tale of her adventure . " Oh , you 'll be proud of your little mother , " she told him . " Tartakow does n't show up on any map , but I figured , listen , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I drove and I drove . I read the road signs  --  I knew where I was going . I remember my father telling me it was near a market town , Sokal . Papa , may he rest in peace  --  I 've told you this story  --  heard from somebody in his Landtsleit society that Tartakow was completely destroyed in the war . The news killed him  --  one day he was fine , the next day he took to his bed , and that was that . I poured him a glass of schnapps  --  he just waved it away . And believe me , your grandpa liked his whiskey now and then . Anyway  --  so I get to Sokal  --  not a problem . An awful place  --  a pigsty like you would n't believe . I ask for the way to Tartakow . Tartakow , ' this fellow says to me , this is at what they call the Jewish Museum  --  a miserable little building with a Star of David on it , the place smells like a sewer and looks like it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , this old guy behind the counter  --  older than me , I mean  --  he gets out this big book , like a ledger , leather-bound , and he thumbs through it , and then he says to me , in Yiddish , he says , Finished . ' He makes a gesture like he 's slitting his throat . Finished , ' he tells me again . So to make a long story short , I never got to Tartakow . Nobody knows where it is ; nobody remembers . How can that be ? Can a town just vanish ? That 's what I want to know . " <p> Suskind remembered that conversation as he stood at his mother 's bedside . Twelve years had passed , but he recalled vividly what he 'd thought of as he 'd listened to her story on the phone . He 'd thought of a Holocaust documentary he 'd seen one day long ago in Hebrew school ; it might have been the year of his bar mitzvah . He remembered sitting in a classroom in the basement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the movie screen , listening to the whir of the projector . In the semidark he could see his fingers splayed on his desk like crab claws . The film was composed of snippets of Nazi footage about the death camps , intended for German wartime audiences , interspersed with animated maps that showed troop movements and mounting death tolls . The Nazi segments still carried their original strident , barking voiceover narration , none of which Suskind could understand . One long shot showed smoke coming out of a tall chimney . At the time none of this made much of an impression  --  it was just another movie about how everybody hated the Jews , and Suskind would rather have been outside playing basketball . But there was something about the shot of the chimney that had struck him , and as he listened to his mother recounting her Polish adventure , he saw the plume of smoke again in his mind , and now he knew what it was : it was the smoke from the ashes of Tartakow . <p> " Hey , Morn ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets to caress her hand . " Tartakow ? Remember that trip you took to Europe not long after Dad died ? " But she 'd fallen asleep again . <p> 5 When Suskind got to his cubicle at ten o'clock Wednesday morning , there was a small , weather-beaten man in a dusty navy-blue suit camped outside his doorway puffing on a cigarette , despite large No Smoking signs prominently displayed everywhere in sight . The man was wearing a fragrant , sweat-stained straw fedora and thick-soled boots caked with what Suskind hoped was mud . " Zeldin , Sol , " the man said in a smoker 's voice , and held out a gnarled , leathery hand for Suskind to shake . " My old friend Futterman called me this morning . I owe him big-time , on account of past favors too numerous to mention . Anyway , here I am . At your service . " <p> " You 're here to see me ? " <p> " You 're Suskind , Elliot ? " <p> " I am . " <p> Then I 'm here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , then motioned the little man inside and into an easy chair . Suskind sat down behind his desk and watched the smoke from Zeldin 's cigarette wafting toward the ceiling . He rummaged through a desk drawer looking for something resembling an ashtray , found nothing ; so finally he scooted a metal wastebasket across . Zeldin leaned back , took off his fedora and brushed at some invisible substance . His scalp was brown and nearly hairless , covered with spots that looked precancerous . <p> " I said a misha heirach for your mother this morning already ; she should live to be a hundred , " he said , puffing mightly . He held the cigarette between his thumb and middle finger . " I knew your father , by the way , may he rest in peace . Sunday mornings when you were a baby we 'd meet , a group of us , at Beckman 's Dell on Arguello . The smoked sable was only so-so , but the company was a pleasure . Your father was something . The stories he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man could sell shoes  --  I say this with reverence . It 's a gift . " <p> " Yes , he always enjoyed his work , " Suskind said . " So Rabbi Futterman called you ? " <p> " This morning he called , " Zeldin replied , and squashed his butt against the inside wall of the wastebasket . " I was on the toilet . At my age you do n't pass up a chance for a good b.m . It can be the highlight of your day . Do you mind ? " Zeldin asked , and took out a pack of cigarettes . " I ought to quit . But what else do I have ? You 're young , you 've still got all your faculties . At my age I should do whatever feels good . " <p> Suskind shrugged , then cocked his head and watched Zeldin light up . Inside his skull he heard the ticking of a clock . There were phone calls to be made ; he had to get ready for tomorrow 's meeting with Temple , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my God , there was the hospital , always the hospital awaiting him . " What-what can I do for you ? " he asked at last . " You have to understand , with my mother sick and all that ... " <p> " My friend Futterman thought I might be of use to you , " Zeldin said . " You mentioned something to him about an exhibition here ? Something you 're working on at the moment ? " <p> Suskind bristled . This was always the way it was with his mother and her friends . " I mentioned my work , yes , " he said . " I do n't recall saying I needed any help with it . " <p> " Is that so . Well , he got it wrong , then . He thought I might be of some use to you . I drove down from Philo this morning . You would n't believe the traffic ! So many people ! " <p> " That was very kind of you . Actually , I was in a jam with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already . I 'm sorry you made the trip for nothing . " <p> Now it was Zeldin 's turn to shrug . " Like I said , I owe Futterman big-time . Well , obviously it was some sort of misunderstanding . " He clamped the cigarette in his mouth and pushed himself up from the easy chair with a grunt . <p> " What do you do up there in Philo ? " Suskind asked , suddenly a bit ashamed of his testy reply a moment before . " Sit down a minute , finish your smoke . I 'll get you a cup of coffee if you like . " <p> Zeldin sat down again and flicked ashes into the wastebasket . " Homing pigeons , " he said . " I 'd love a glass of tea if you got it . " " Homing pigeons ? " <p> " Not a business  --  more a hobby . At my age , who needs a business ? But I wo n't kid you  --  I know more about homing pigeons than anybody on the West Coast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one pant leg . " I 'm what they call an expert , " he added , and blew a smoke ring upward . " Traffic ! The people out here ! Gevalt ! It took half a tank of gas just to get me here this morning , with the honking and the beeping and the mishegoss . " <p> " Pigeons ? " Suskind repeated . <p> " Homing pigeons , " Zeldin corrected . " This exhibition  --  why anybody would put on an exhibition about memory and navigation without homing pigeons is beyond me . I mean absolutely beyond me . " Zeldin paused and coughed . " Just picture this , Mr. Suskind : a flock of homing pigeons , " he said , then he shut his eyes and flung out his free hand dramatically . " Think of it  --  all those wings ! " The arc of his hand described a broad expanse of sky , the panoramic dappled blue that hung above the waters of the bay  --  the bay Suskind might have gazed at from his cubicle window , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhaling deeply now , a decrepit yellow smile spreading across his weathered face . " Take it from Sol Zeldin  --  this what I 'm describing to you would be genuine real crowd-pleaser . " <p> " Well , gee , " Suskind said at last . " That 's something , all right . A whole lot of homing pigeons , hmm ? " he asked . He saw pigeon shit raining from the sky . " That 's very interesting . Actually , though , I 've already solved my problem for opening day . It 's all worked out . Things were a little tense for a while , but thank God , I 've got that part covered . Thank you for your willingness to help out , though . Like I said , I 'm sorry you drove all the way down here for nothing . " He reached for his wallet . " I 'd be glad to pay you for the gas . " <p> " You mentioned a glass of tea , maybe ? " Zeldin licked his lips . " A sip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suskind . I promise you . I know you 're a busy man . " <p> Suskind fetched a cup of tea from the vending machine , and when he brought it back , Zeldin sipped it through a sugar cube he retrieved from a pocket . When he 'd drained the cup , he said , " You know , everybody 's got a theory about homing pigeons . " He produced a Kleenex and wiped his lips . " Professor Slotkin at Harvard says it 's all because they got a built-in gyroscope in their brain . Professor Plotkin at Yale says they can read the angle of the sun  --  bingo , homeward bound . But I 'll tell you a secret . " He leaned across the desk and laid a hand on Suskind 's arm . " Slotkin , Plotkin , the rest of them , degrees on top of degrees , but they know from bubkes about homing pigeons . Why is a homing pigeon a homing pigeon , you ask ? I 'll tell you : for one reason only . A homing pigeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wants to go home  --  so he goes . " At that , he nodded as if acknowledging applause , then clapped his hat back on his head dramatically and folded his hands over one knee . <p> " Well , gee . Is that right ? " Suskind said at last , and gave a tentative , fleeting smile . Then he glanced at his watch . He could n't help himself . He had things to do . <p> Zeldin regarded him skeptically for a moment ; then , before Suskind could thank him again for his time , the old man muttered a gruff goodbye and scuttled out the door , leaving a brown scrape of something pungent along the floor as a memento of his visit . <p> If it were n't for that shit-colored smear on the tile and the smell of cigarette smoke that hung in his cubicle like incense , Suskind might have been tempted , half an hour later , to wonder if Zeldin had ever been there . The real world rolled along merrily just outside his door . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office  --  workmen pounding together the maze for Remembering the Way . Specialists from the California Academy of Science were putting finishing touches on a gigantic rotating tank to be filled with eels , which would demonstrate their navigational genius three times a day during the exhibition 's run . Carpenters and technicians from the museum 's video department were setting up a series of interactive video stations , each of which would tell a different story . Suskind had seen them all : one showed how bees performed elaborate dances to lead each other to honey and then back to the hive ; another recounted how the sextant was invented ; another followed a group of puffins , who navigate the frozen seas with unerring accuracy ; another , aimed at children , showed a simple method for charting a course by the stars . <p> One video struck Suskind like an arrow in the heart ; it featured the odd story of Violet Beecham , an elderly woman now living in Bodega Bay , who 'd spent most of her eighties sketching uncannily accurate pictures of Witbury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd lived for the first four years of her life . She 'd never been back to Witbury , and her technical skill as an artist was minimal  --  yet her memory of the town 's ancient streets and buildings was preternaturally perfect : as the video demonstrated , the town , which had fallen into an intractable economic depression after World War I and been bypassed for the most part by twentieth-century progress , still existed cottage by cottage , lane by lane , cobblestone by cobblestone , as Violet Beecham had drawn it . <p> How could Tartakow , his grandparents ' tiny shtetl , have disappeared from the face of the earth  --  vaporized , transformed into smoke and ash  --  while not so many miles away ( on a wall map of Europe he spanned the distance effortlessly between his thumb and index finger ) , Witbury had been preserved so completely , so lovingly , as if trapped in amber ? It made no sense . <p> The day stretched ahead of him , full of promise . Suskind filled his coffee mug in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a map of San Francisco , staring at it with an intensity he had n't felt in months . OK , he thought , save yourself , you fucking idiot . It 's the eleventh hour . Someone 's thrown you the rope . Now grab and pull yourself out before you drown . This time , Suskind knew , everything was going to have to come off perfectly . <p> He 'd found out the hard way over the years just how fickle an opening-day crowd could be . Once upon a time he 'd had a reputation as an impresario , thanks to extravaganzas like the Tower of Babel , an event he 'd devised for the Language Acquisition show eleven years ago . What a job it had been , locating all those native speakers , sixty different languages among them  --  and what a group : a United Nations gathering , all of them in traditional dress , chattering away at one another in Ibanag and Noghai , Tongan , Kashmiri , and Chuvash , waving their hands , cracking jokes in Samoan and Veps and Gujarati @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Baluchi , declaiming in Nicobarese . <p> With such pandemonium , something was bound to happen : an innocent remark in Papango turned out by chance to be insulting in Muong , and the ensuing melee was caught on film , captured by local TV crews hoping for a story on a slow news day . All three local , network affiliates ran the tape that night , and in the following days , crowds poured through the museum 's gates , the turnstiles whirling like the blades of a window fan . In the parking lot one afternoon , Suskind counted license plates from eighteen states . It was his finest hour . <p> But now the Tower of Babel was ancient history . In recent years he 'd come up with a string of disasters , like the Our Amazing Brain grand opening , for which he 'd booked a slate of intellectual geek acts , turning the museum 's front lawn into a carnival midway , complete with barkers ranting at the crowds . The headliner , a wizened little fellow from San Pablo who billed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify the day of the week that April 20 fell on in any given year . Someone from the crowd would yell out , " 1693 ! " and Mr. Mnemonic would hesitate for an awful , strangling moment , then croak out his reply : " Wednesday . You can look it up . " Then he 'd mop his brow with a red bandana and wait for the crowd to applaud politely . Unfortunately , that was the entire act , and after an hour of this the people drifted away . Reviews in the next day 's Chronicle and Examiner were devastating , and despite months of careful preparation , Our Amazing Brain closed in just two weeks . <p> The following spring Suskind had been given a shot at redemption with What Are the Chances ? , an exhibition devoted to the mathematics of probability . This time his scheme drew the massive throngs he 'd dreamed of  --  but when it was discovered that the bevy of good-looking Berkeley coeds he 'd hired to work the crowds were running a fixed game of three-card monte in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , and every penny of revenue generated by increased attendance went straight into the pockets of well-coiffed Montgomery Street lawyers . <p> That was all behind him now . He was turning a new page  --  no , scratch that : he was starting a whole new book . Poor old Mr. Zeldin , driving all the way down here for nothing ; Suskind would have to thank Rabbi Futterman the next time he saw him , and let him know the problem had gone away . He had to admit , though , that for a minute there he 'd been touched by the old guy 's homesick-pigeon spiel . But who had time to be touched ? Not Suskind  --  not right now , thank you . He leaned back , shut his eyes , and saw a small band of bicycle messengers careening through the mazelike course of city streets , screaming like banshees as they crested impossible hills , taking comers at a forty-five-degree slant , pedaling at impossible speeds , an inch away at any moment from skidding knees-first into the pavement . He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the museum 's finish line : Look ! Here they come ! The whir of the pedaling lost amid the screams of the onlookers , bloodied knees pumping in a frenzy , riders bent double , butts high , riding side by side now , leaning well over their handlebars to meet the tape .... Oh , yes : Suskind the impresario , maestro of all he surveyed , back in business after all these years . <p> 6 That night he went to the hospital again . His mother drifted in and out of consciousness , but even when she seemed awake , she was not altogether herself . Glucose and other fluids still seeped into her bruise-blackened arms . At one side of the bed her urine , a deep umber , dripped into a heavy plastic pouch . She had kicked the covers off , and her legs lay splayed on top of the sheets , covered with inflatable stockings that looked like they 'd been designed as instruments of torture . A moist , musty odor-death ? decay ?  --  hovered faintly in the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the doctors had ruled out any nourishment by mouth  --  liquid or solid-for fear she 'd aspirate something into her lungs and complicate her pneumonia . Her lips were cracked , covered with thick , flaky goo , and she was desperately thirsty . So Suskind dipped a small sponge stuck on the end of a lollipop stick into water , then held it between his mother 's lips and let her suck on it for a few seconds at a time . Her eyes were closed , and she sucked on the sponge with pure pleasure , wrapping her toothless gums around it . <p> The stroke had left one corner of her mouth paralyzed , so that when she opened her eyes sleepily and tried to smile at him , her expression was deeply ironic . " Hey , Mom , " Suskind said . He brushed a hand gently over her forehead and up into her sparse , wiry hair . Her forehead felt cool . " How you doing ? " he asked . " You feeling any better ? " <p> She stared back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You want to know something ? I 'll tell you a secret , " she said in a sandpapery voice . " Getting old is hell . " <p> There she was : Miriam Suskind , his wisenheimer mother ! " Mom ! " he said . " You 're back . Hi there . " <p> But then her eyes clouded over , and in an instant she was gone again . Suskind sagged , his elbows suddenly on her bed , his head propped in his hands . For God 's sake , where was Rabbi Futterman ? He needed to be here for stuff like this . What did Suskind know about it ? Getting old is hell ? Well , he had news for her : getting to be middle-aged was n't a day at the beach , either . Futterman should be here to say something comforting to her  --  something wise and avuncular . What else did he have to do ? Play golf ? Sit around his stockbroker 's office , watching the ticker tape ? He straightened up and tried to regain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you today ? " he asked her . <p> His mother opened her eyes to glistening slits and glared at him , still smirking . <p> " Ma ? " he said . " Has Rabbi Futterman been by ? " <p> " No , " she croaked , and shook her head in irritation , roiling her eyes as if the question had been patently ridiculous . <p> " I saw him here last night , " Suskind told her . " We had a nice little talk . He looks amazingly healthy , considering his age . He 's ancient . He must be over a hundred , is n't he ? " <p> Again she shook her head . Then she shut her eyes , and in a breath she was asleep . <p> Randy was lurking in the shadows when Suskind entered the foyer of his apartment building that evening . " Hey , you think my idea might work out ? " he asked . <p> " Yeah . Yeah , I do . In fact , I think it saved my job for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Randy . <p> " Wow . You owe me one , " Randy said in an awestruck voice . " Unbelievable . Nobody 's owed me one in , like , forever . Hey , listen  --  a bunch of us from Mercury , we 're having a party Saturday night . You want to go ? " <p> " Oh , gosh , I do n't know . Thanks for the invitation , " said Suskind , smiling ruefully . " I do n't do much partying , to be honest . And anyway , with my mother in the hospital ... " <p> " Oh , yeah , hey , how 's she doing ? " <p> " Not too well . At her age  --  well , anyway , I think I 'll probably want to go over and spend some time with her . You know how it is  --  every time I see her , I think it might be the last time . " He opened his mailbox and extracted a small pile of bills and credit-card offers . <p> " Yeah , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get out once in a while , though  --  have a little fun . You know ? Brighten up your day , man . We have these great parties . A good time is had by all , and that 's no lie . We 're looking for one more guy . And I think it 's you , Upstairs Dude . " <p> " They need a guy ? " Suskind asked . " I do n't know . I 'm fifty years old . ! do n't think I 'm a guy anymore . Guys are mostly about twenty-five . At least that 's my impression . " <p> Randy smiled . " See , you 're really funny , man . You 're a gas . You ought to get out , have a few laughs . Come on . You owe me one , right ? Saturday night , eight o'clock . Chance to meet all the guys from Mercury . The guys who 'll be in the race , you know ? " <p> Suskind 's eyebrows went up . " Well , look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Maybe you 're right . Maybe I ought to take a break . I 'll keep it in mind . " <p> " You could just come and go  --  very informal , like . Keep it in mind . " Randy scribbled an address on a soiled scrap of paper and thrust it into Suskind 's hands , then disappeared into the shadows of the foyer . <p> 7 When Doug Escobar , Ellen Watanabe , Stuart Wisotsky , and Arthur Wexler stopped by Suskind 's cubicle Thursday morning to offer their condolences about his mother , he was busily plotting the last of the opening-day bicycle routes on a large foldout map of San Francisco , in preparation for his meeting with Temple . He used a yellow highlighting pen to indicate the route , smiling to himself with pleasure as he laid it out . This one started at the end of Battery East Road , near the south entrance to the Golden Gate Bridge , and wound in drunken circles through the narrow roads of the Presidio before zigzagging through the Marina , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Addition , and up again over Nob Hill on its way to the museum 's broad lawn facing the Embarcadero . <p> He looked up , startled , when Escobar and the others walked in . Stuart Wisotsky reached down as if to comfort Suskind , then pinched him fiercely on the soft , sensitive flesh just above his elbow , his fingers digging in as if he truly meant to tear off a nice meaty piece and wolf it down . " Describe that pain to me in ten words or less , will you ? " Wisotsky asked . " Just kidding . Really , though  --  that hurt like a sonuvabitch , did n't it ? " <p> " Hey , would you look at that , " Escobar exclaimed . " Here lie is , hard at work on the big race . Are n't you ? " he said , turning to Suskind . " Well , Elliot , that 's just grand . It 's damned professional of you to be here at your desk pumping out the old cheese when you really ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 're doing . You 're probably going through one of the stages of grief right now , so do n't worry about making sense or keeping up appearances . We 're going to cut you a tremendous amount of slack for the time being , given your situation . Babble if you want to . Just say anything that comes into your head and it will be OK with us . " <p> Ellen Watanabe gripped Suskind 's shoulder lightly and smiled at him , a brave hint of moisture in her eyes . " Elliot , I just wanted to stop by and tell you that I 'm thinking about you , and sending my best wishes your way , " she said in a trembling voice . " I wish there was something else I could say , " she added . <p> " That 's very kind of you . Oh , hey , listen , Ellen  --  you know what ? " he said . " I saw you on television not long ago ! I was having supper , and there you were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bash for Rockefeller Fellows . Rockefeller Fellows ! Hey , they should call them Rockefellows ! " <p> A cloud descended over Ellen 's glistening porcelain face . <p> " Whoa , I like that , " Suskind continued . " Rockefellows ! What do you think ? " <p> " That 's very amusing , " she said ; her eyes were dry now . <p> " What did I tell you ? He 's babbling . I wish he was n't , but he is , " said Escobar to no one in particular . " My God . You really are in one of the stages of grief , " he muttered . " Well , keep up the good work . We 're all counting on you , Elliot . Now we 've got to be going  --  busy , busy , busy , " he added , and patted Suskind on the head . <p> Arthur Wexler lingered after the others had left . " Can we talk a minute ? " he asked . " It 's important . " <p> " Sure , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wexler had never spoken to him until this moment , not so much as a simple hello in eleven years  --  not a wave , a raised eyebrow , an acknowledgment of his existence . Suskind had long ago dismissed him as one of the museum 's squadron of silent geniuses  --  the ponderous , tongue-tied pundits who roamed the bright halls bumping into each other absent-mindedly , free-floating through an intellectual atmosphere that was more profound , more complex than anything ordinary language could express . <p> Or so Suskind had always assumed , until now . Wexler began , leaning forward and putting his forearms on Suskind 's desk . " You mind if I unload on you for just a minute ? My wife left me three years ago . Twelve years of marriage down the drain like that , " he said , snapping his fingers . " She took our two children with her  --  boy and a girl . I 've seen them a total of six times in three years . Last time I met them at the airport I wore a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can you imagine it ? A big sandwich-board thing  --  I hand-lettered it , WEXLER , in these big block letters . Look , you and I do n't know each other  --  but I hope it 's OK that I 'm telling you this . I thought maybe you 'd understand , with your morn and all . I guess I just figured you 'd know what I 'm talking about . And anyway , you 're Jewish , are n't you ? " <p> " Yeah , " Suskind said , and then shrugged . " More or less . " He thought of his encounter with Rabbi Futterman at his mother 's bedside , the old man 's gnarled , liver-spotted hand on his shoulder like a benediction . But still , what had it amounted to ? A moment of peace and introspection , perhaps , but that was all , punctuated by a few mumbled Hebrew phrases he did n't understand . For all he knew , Futterman could have been ordering in a pizza . <p> " I thought so , " Wexler told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't it ? " <p> " I guess so . I do n't know . Does it ? " What did Wexler have in mind ? Were they supposed to share some sort of secret Jewish handshake , scarf down herring in sour cream , start davening together in an expression of ghetto brotherhood ? <p> " I do n't know . I was just asking . " <p> " Oh , that 's OK , " Suskind said . <p> " I think it 's awful about your mother . Mine died last year . I 'd been expecting it ; she 'd been sick a while  --  cancer  --  but still , it damn near killed me. ! had to call my kids and tell them their grandmother was dead . God , it ruined me . They cried on the phone for half an hour . " <p> " I called my son the other night , " Suskind said . " I wanted to tell him his grandma 's dying . He was n't at home  --  he was at the movies with his trashy friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit . That 's all there is anymore  --  sex and violence . Anyway , he still has n't called me back . I think my ex-wife forgot to give him the message . " <p> " My ex-wife does that , too . Take a message , I tell her . How hard can it be ? But she never does . " <p> " Get this : he 's begun shoplifting . My son , I mean . He 's fifteen now , and the way things are going he 'll probably be in prison by the time he 's twenty . " <p> " Tomorrow 's my anniversary  --  we would have been married fifteen years , " Wexler said . <p> " I would have been married seventeen years last month . I ca n't even remember what it was like to be married . Is n't that something ? I 've blocked out my entire goddamned life , " said Suskind . He was about to go on , but he stopped himself . What was this , a competition ? <p> Wexler got up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for listening , " he said . " I feel a lot better now . " <p> " You do ? " asked Suskind , who felt , if anything , worse than he had before . <p> " Yeah . Funny , is n't it ? I wonder why that is . " <p> " Well , look , you want to have lunch or something sometime ? Talk it out a little more ? " <p> " No , I do n't think so , " said Wexler . " I usually just get some yogurt and sit at my desk . " " Oh . " <p> " But hey , thanks , " he said , and lumbered out of Suskind 's cubicle . <p> Temple Hodge was prettier than her voice had led Suskind to imagine . He 'd envisioned someone in the range of three hundred pounds , slapping a riding crop sharply against her thigh ; he 'd conjured up black knee-high boots , a monocle , and a face crisscrossed by Heidelberg dueling scars . But none of this turned out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hefty side , though her bulk seemed firm rather than flabby . She wore a cardigan sweater over a turtleneck , and a denim skirt , and there was n't a riding crop anywhere in the picture . She sat at a desk dominated by a computer with an oversized monitor , flanked by a control panel filled with flashing lights . " Have a seat , " she said , and poured Suskind a cup of coffee . <p> " I 've drawn up a few routes for you to take a look at , " he said , and pushed a thin pile of papers across the desk . <p> She gazed at the highlighted routes . " So , you 're one of those geeks from the museum , eh ? " she said . " I dated a guy from the physics department when I was in college . Six months , and the guy could never find his zipper . He spent two hours one night trying to unhook my bra . And I was n't even wearing one . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Honest . I 'm just the publicity guy . I 'm not one of the geniuses . " <p> Temple looked up and stared at him sharply . " No , I guess you 're not . OK , you want my cooperation ? I do n't care . Fine  --  let the little shits kill themselves , that 's my attitude . They want to race all over town running into roadblocks  --  that 's their idea of fun  --  fine by me . But I 've got a company to run . This is a service business  --  my drivers are out hurt , I ca n't provide service . I ca n't provide service , I do n't get paid . I do n't get paid , I bite somebody 's head off . Get the picture ? " <p> " I 've got it , you bet , " Suskind said . <p> " OK , so here 's the rules . One : no big free-for-all with messengers banging into each other on the curves . I 'll give you six racers  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's fine . " <p> " Do n't say That 's fine ' until I tell you to say That 's fine . ' Two : start time  --  zero-eight-hundred hours . Three : finish  --  no later than eleven-hundred hours . Those are my terms . Do n't ask for any changes . Like the menu says , no substitutions . You ask for changes , I 'll bite your head clean off right here and now . " <p> " Is that it ? Just three conditions ? Really ? And you 'll arrange for six racers to compete ? " He would have leaned across and kissed her forehead , but he felt sure , somehow , that if he tried anything like that , she 'd bite into him like a pit bull . <p> " Now that you mention it , just one more thing . Randy tells me he invited you for Saturday night ? " She regarded him with her head cocked and one eyebrow raised . <p> " Uh , yeah . He mentioned that . I told him that with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the fourth condition . I left that one out . Unless you think I 'm being unreasonable . In which case  --  " She flashed a smile full of strong white teeth . <p> " Oh , no . Not at all . " <p> That evening at the hospital Suskind let his mother suck on the tiny water-soaked sponge for quite a while . He knew he probably should n't ( the nurses had warned him she could n't swallow properly , and the water might find its way into her lungs ) , but she was so desperately thirsty that he could n't help himself . Her eyes were closed , and apart from her sucking she seemed inert , insensate . The goo on her lips was taking on a life of its own , so he peeled some off , working carefully so as not to cause any bleeding . The whiskers on her chin had grown . He stared at them as she sucked the sponge . Maybe in a day or two he could shave her , or have one of the nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheeled cart being pushed up the hall ; someone shouted something from the nurses ' station  --  or maybe it was just a television set . The last rays of sunset poured into his mother 's room , a deep red-orange , even deeper than the color of her urine . The light ran in a broad swath over the cabinets beneath the windows , then down across the linoleum floor and up again , onto the white bedspread , casting everything it touched in a rich display of umbers and siennas . How odd that the longer he stood here , letting his mother suck on this tiny sponge , the more ordinary it all began to seem : the cart 's clatter , the whiskers , the ruckus by the nurses ' station , the last golden glow of sunset  --  he might get used to this . This might turn into the rest of his life . <p> It was some time later  --  half an hour or longer , he could n't have said , but now he was standing in the dark  --  that a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned and saw a figure silhouetted in the light of the hallway . " Nick ? " he asked . " My God . Is that you ? " <p> Nick approached . " Morn said you called , " he said . Apparently shoplifting agreed with him ; he 'd grown taller , thinner , perhaps even more handsome , since Suskind had seen him last . <p> " How 'd you get over here from Walnut Creek ? " Suskind asked , and took a diffident step toward Nick , as if to hug him . Then he stopped . As always in the presence of his son , he felt his throat closing up . Had his own father ever felt such heart-pounding terror and love for him as he pulled into the driveway at day 's end ? If so , Suskind had never noticed it . <p> " I hitched , " Nick said . He grinned . " It took all day . It was really cool . I skipped school , but hey , it 's for a good cause , right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Does your mother know where you are ? " <p> " No . " Nick looked away and scratched his cheek . " I was going to tell her  --  then I did n't . " <p> Suskind frowned and blew several breaths out through his nose . " You 're in some pretty bad trouble , kid , " he said at last . " Your mother told me about the shoplifting . " <p> " That was a misunderstanding . " Nick shook his head and retreated a step toward the door . " Hey , look , I should have called first . I just wanted to come over , say hi to Grandma , that 's all . " He peered at her in the dimness . " Gee , " he said , " you know , she looks really bad . I did n't think she was going to look so  --  old . " He glanced anxiously at Suskind . " Is she going to be OK ? " <p> A memory of his father flickered in Suskind 's mind : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Too soon to tell , Nick . She 's an old lady . Sometimes you get sick , you do n't get well again . " <p> " I know that . " <p> " Sit down a while , " said Suskind , patting a nearby bed . " C'm on , take a load off . We 'll call your morn in a minute , let her know where you are . Then I 'm going to buy you some dinner downstairs . They 've got a pretty good cafeteria here . " <p> " Oh , that 's OK , Dad . Thanks , though . I just wanted to  --  " <p> " Do it for me , will you ? " Suskind asked . His voice was suddenly thin and brittle , like the shell of something hollow . " You know what it means to me , you coming here like this ? " And then he knew he could n't say anything at all for a while . Nick sat in the chair nearest the bed . Suskind sank into a low , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark , watching the labored rise and fall of the old woman 's chest . <p> After a few minutes Suskind went down the hall and called Brenda . " That little rat , " she said , her voice full of tears . " I 've been tearing my hair out , Elliot . He 's been gone all day long . When he gets back here I 'm going to kill him . You tell him he 'd better watch out , he 's on thin ice with me . " She sighed , more a shudder . " You mind driving him back ? " <p> " No , no , of course not . But do n't wait up . We 'll get some dinner first . " <p> " I 'm not kidding , Elliot  --  that child is getting to be too much . " <p> Suskind peered into the dark tunnel of his imagination , and saw a faint glimmer ahead . " Well , then think about this : maybe I could take Nick for a while . You know  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he 's at an awkward age . When I was fifteen I stopped speaking to my parents for six months . I ca n't even remember why  --  I just remember doing it . I overheard them one night in the kitchen , I was supposed to be upstairs asleep  --  they were sitting up talking , and my mother was crying . Where did we go wrong ? ' she asked . I was driving them crazy . " <p> " So he gets it from you , then ? Is that what you 're saying ? " <p> " Sure . He gets it from me . What I 'm saying is , just think about it : maybe he needs a male role model  --  an authority figure , I mean . You know  --  a guy . " <p> " Oh , right . You 're such an authority figure . " Brenda tssked and then fell silent . " OK , look , " she added , " I tell you what : let me think it over . Why do n't we talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it would have to be something Nick wanted . And it would have to work out with his schooling and all that . He 's going through a strange phase . " <p> When he got back to the room , Nick was asleep in the chair , his head tilted to one side , his mouth open slightly . The light from the hallway caught his nose stud , which glinted like a tiny jewel . Suskind gazed at his son for a long while . Was this the face of a shoplifter ? Yes , no doubt it was  --  he 'd watched the evening news for too many years to have illusions about such things . But to hell with the evening news  --  what did that have to do with anything ? This was his son , the sweet little boy he 'd carried in his arms . He remembered an incident when Nick was nearly seven ; father and son were reunited for one of their rare and painful weekends together , and Nick brought along his best friend at the time , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the child of a woman who drank . Nick 's birthday was coming up , so Suskind took the boys to lunch at Burger King , then to a Toys R Us at a mall in Lafayette , where he gave his son twenty dollars to spend . " Make it something you really want , " he told him . " Something special . You only get one birthday a year . I 'll wait outside , by the benches  --  take your time . " The boys went off , arm in arm , in search of the perfect toy . Half an hour later they emerged , beaming , each holding a large package . In the car they proudly unveiled their purchases : Zarkon Death-Ray Imploder kits  --  the deluxe models , complete with detachable shoulder straps , Hellotron grenade launchers , night goggles , and extra ammo . <p> That night at bedtime , in response to Suskind 's question , Nick turned to him sleepily , rubbing one eye , and explained , " You gave me twenty dollars  --  I had enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would n't be any fun to have one if he did n't have one , too , Dad . " His voice was soft and patient , his face so solemn , his eyes so trusting  --  it was a moment Suskind would carry with him forever . I bought one or Josh . It would n't be any fun to have one if he did n't have one , too . Suskind had few memories of Nick 's childhood  --  how could he , after all , since he 'd missed so much of it ?  --  but this one he would never forget . How could he ever believe that his son was a bad boy ? This child ? This soft-voiced , golden child ? <p> Suskind let Nick sleep for a while ; then he nudged him awake , and the two of them went down to the cafeteria for wretched hamburgers . Afterward , he drove the boy home . Traffic was light on the Bay Bridge , and they made the trip through the twinkling velvety darkness in half an hour . As they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick turned to Suskind . " Make sure to tell grandma I was there , " he said . " When she wakes up , I mean . OK ? Tell her hello from me . And say  --  tell her I 'll be back , I 'll come see her again as soon as I can . " <p> " OK  --  now you 've got to do something for me , " said Suskind . " Give your mother a hug and a kiss when you get inside , and tell her you 're sorry you worried her . Tell her you 're never going to do anything like that again . " <p> " Anything like what ? " Nick asked , exasperated . <p> " Ever again , in your entire life , period , " Suskind insisted . " And maybe if you 're lucky she wo n't kill you . " <p> Nick frowned and rolled his eyes . " I meant to call her , honest . All I wanted  --  " <p> " I know , " Suskind said . " Good night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at the curb and waved . Suskind waited until his son was safely inside , then turned the car around in the cul-de-sac at the end of the block and drove back toward the city . It was a clear , balmy night , and Suskind opened the window to let the breeze wash his face . <p> 8 The next morning Suskind arrived at his mother 's bedside at six and sat there like a lump , eyes fixed on her chest , hypnotized by the unsteady rise and fall of her breath , for an hour and a half before Dr. Agron and his herd of exhausted , sleepwalking interns filed in . Suskind looked up at them , dazed , as if awakening from a dream . They passed around her chart , pursed their lips and made incoherent clucking noises , then huddled in a hunched ring around her bed and conferred among themselves for several minutes in jargon Suskind had no hope of understanding . Finally they wheeled about and stampeded out , stopping only to clap him on the back one by one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow in the early-morning light . " God bless , she 's not in a good situation , " he sighed . " She 's a sweet woman , your mother . We go way back . She 's always been a sharp cookie . You could never put anything over on Miriam Suskind . " Then Dr. Agron shook his head , shrugged , and turned away  --  so Suskind sat down wearily by the bed again . <p> At ten he went down the hall and splashed water on his face in the bathroom . He was n't gone more than a couple of minutes . But when he returned , his mother was dead . He stood there holding his breath , staring at her chest , expecting to see it expand again laboriously . He held his breath until his lungs were screaming  --  then he inhaled , and stared at her for two more minutes , then five  --  and still his mother 's chest did not rise . Slowly the realization of what had happened crept over him , pressing down upon him , dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all at once he knew that as awful as it had been these past few days to sit and watch her struggle for air  --  terrible as it had been to see her here , in this sad state , a dying bag of flesh , mute and toothless , robbed of her modesty ( her hospital gown had drifted down at times to reveal the stringy , bluish flesh of her breasts , and Suskind , a bottle baby , always averted his gaze )  --  he realized now that he would miss coming here , to this sad , musty-smelling room ; he would miss the darkness of the hospital 's parking garage , the stupid tchotchkes of the gift shop , the awful cafeteria food , even Dr. Agron and his battered troupe of student doctors on their rounds ; he would miss dipping little sponges into water for his mother to suck ; he would miss pulling gently at the goo on her lips , stroking the wisps of her hair back from her forehead , cooing words of encouragement ; he would miss all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for her . Even if he 'd wanted to come back tomorrow and sit by her bedside for another day , watching her die a little bit more , a breath at a time , he could n't . <p> What would he do now with all the hours of the day ? <p> He took her hand in his ; it was still warm , though as he held it he could feel it turn clammy , cold seeping into her fingers as if she 'd slipped on cool silk gloves . Her eyes had retreated into her skull ; one was half-open , and Suskind could n't bring himself to touch it . This was n't his mother . His mother was gone . She 'd been gone for a while , in fact ; what was left in the bed , what he 'd been watching over for the last several weeks , was just the waxy , rotting rubbish we all become , the leftover organs and brittle bones , the debris of a life . <p> He walked to the doorway and leaned against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should go get someone . Usually there was a parade of traffic up and down this hall  --  orderlies and nurses and interns , food-service employees , lab technicians , chaplains , physical therapists , relatives and recovering patients out for their prescribed walks , accompanied by rolling IV units . But now there was no one  --  the hospital might have been deserted for all he knew . Suskind stood there for some time , gazing absently down the silent hall , unsure of where to turn or how to move forward from this spot ; then suddenly he was surprised by the sound of a page being flipped behind him . He turned to see Rabbi Futterman , rocking on his heels , praying by the bed . He wore an oversized prayer shawl , which engulfed his diminutive form completely . A black homburg a size too small perched precariously on his head . He was weeping as he prayed . <p> There were forms to be signed  --  various releases , authorizations , affidavits-and Suskind dutifully scribbled his signature over and over again on the indicated lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' station , Rabbi Futterman called the Mandelbaum Jewish Chapel on Geary to arrange the funeral . Then he phoned the Chronicle to dictate the death notice , which would appear the following morning . Suskind listened to the rabbi 's conversations with one ear as he sat nearby , signing his name to forms . He marveled at Futterman 's ability to focus on such tasks at a time like this . What an odd little guy  --  to show up at just the moment he was needed , dressed in full mourning regalia , ready to leap in , praying and rocking and crying with the pent-up energy of a man half his age . <p> Jewish practice demanded a hasty burial , but this was Friday  --  Shabbas would be starting at sundown , and Jewish law dictated that no one be buried on Shabbas . So the funeral was quickly set for Sunday afternoon at one , at Emek Israel Cemetery down in Colma . " Leave everything to me , " Rabbi Futterman said , and patted Suskind toward the elevator . " This is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest , call your wife , your son . Take a shower , take a nap , relax . Believe me , you 'll feel better . " <p> Suskind drove home in a fog , and once he was inside his apartment , he soon realized that something about the place looked out of whack , and so before he made any calls , he 'd have to get things squared away again . He rearranged the contents of his refrigerator , lining up the bottles and bowls and cartons by size and separating the fruits and vegetables neatly into piles . He got everything out from under the kitchen sink and cleared the cobwebs around the plumbing . He washed out the garbage can and dried it carefully with paper towels . He noticed a layer of grime on the sill of the kitchen window , and attacked it with Ajax and a Brillo pad . Then he went around and attacked every window in a similar manner . He scrubbed his bathtub and mopped the bathroom floor . He could n't remember ever having done that before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He moved on to the living room , where he alphabetized everything-his books , then his records , tapes , and CDs . Then he went into the bedroom , intent upon arranging his wardrobe by color . But his knees suddenly gave way when he saw his bed , and he sat down on it heavily ; in a moment he 'd fallen asleep . <p> When he awoke , the apartment was dark . His alarm clock told him it was eleven-thirty at night , and Suskind knew perfectly well that this was no time to be calling anyone . But he could n't stop himself . Brenda answered on the fourth ring . Her voice was thick . <p> " I 'm so sorry , Elliot , " she said when he 'd told her . " I mean that . Your mother was always nice to me . Even when she was angry . I liked her  --  I never stopped liking her . She was quite a character . I admired her , too . That 's the truth . " <p> " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You sound tired . " <p> " No . Look , I tell you what , though : I need to get off the phone . I 'm sorry , but I really do . Nick 's not home right now . He 's out . But I 'll give him the message , OK ? " <p> " Is this a bad time to call ? " <p> " Sort of . I have some company over . I 'm sorry , Elliot . Bad timing . You 'll get through this , I know you will . We 'll talk about Nick at the funeral , OK ? I 'll see you Sunday . " <p> At eight the next night , Suskind stood in front of an abandoned futon factory , a three-story building of brick and glass tucked into a tiny alley between Sixth and Seventh , several blocks south of Market Street . He pulled out a scrap of paper and checked the address Randy had given him , then shrugged and sighed . The evening had turned subtly from dusk to night , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance , that 's all . Just a Hi , how are you , awfully nice of you to let me come , my mother just died , oh , gee , look at the time , I 've got to go . They 'd understand . Even Temple Hodge would understand . <p> For that matter , anyone would understand . What was a little harder to grasp was what he was doing here in the first place . The fact was he had no business being out on a night like this . His mother had n't been dead thirty-six hours  --  she was n't even in the ground yet  --  and here he was , on his way to a party . He should be at a synagogue somewhere , knees buckling as he fumbled his way through the Kaddish with the other mourners . Better still , he should be home , sitting on the floor in sackcloth and ashes , wailing , rending his garments , refusing food and drink . <p> On the other hand , his mother was dead , and that was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he stayed home . If she were alive , she would n't begrudge him an hour of enjoyment . Besides , Temple had told him flatly that he had to come . All that talk about biting his head off  --  he 'd met the woman , and he 'd seen her incisors . He believed her . <p> If he could just get through this weekend , if he could just stand up straight and sip a glass of wine and act like everything was OK tonight for an hour or so-even forty-five minutes might be enough  --  and then if he could weather the funeral tomorrow ... Monday the show would open  --  he could watch the bicycle racers barreling along the Embarcadero toward the finish line , the crowds would cheer , and when that was finished he could go off somewhere and start rending his clothing , could keep on rending until there was n't anything left of his wardrobe but lint . <p> The door was ajar , so he entered and made his way up wide flights of stairs , heading uneasily through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above . As Suskind reached the second floor , Randy came out into the murky light of the uppermost landing . " Hey , it 's Upstairs Dude , " Randy called down . His voice echoed in the stairwell . " You made it . Come on up , man . Things are definitely happening . Major events are about to unfold . " <p> Suskind climbed faster . The light was bad , and it was n't until he rounded the last turn that he could see Randy clearly . He was naked . <p> No , not entirely naked , it turned out . A network of elaborate tattoos covered his torso , like a black-and-white paisley bodysuit . And then there was the small embroidered sleeve , like a nose warmer , over his penis ; a thin strap around his waist held the device in place . " Dude , " Randy said impassively as Suskind mounted the final steps . " It 's Saturday night live . " <p> " Uh , Randy ? " Suskind said . " Could we talk ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randy drew Suskind inside , through a shattered door frame , into a large , dimly-lit space . A four-poster bed stood in one corner of the room , covered in floral sheets . There was no other furniture . Suskind counted a dozen people  --  men and women , most of them young and slender and very nearly naked . In one corner , sipping a flute of champagne , Temple Hodge awaited him , a serene slit-eyed smile on her face . She wore a serape , thank God , though it was obvious to Suskind that she had nothing on underneath it . <p> " Oh , Jesus , " he whispered . At fifty , his body was n't anything to write home about ; if it had just been his gut he would n't mind quite so much , but lately his ass had been blooming , spreading its wings as if ready to take flight , and he 'd developed what looked like incipient tits . " Randy ? " he whispered . " Listen , I have to tell you something . See , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . The funeral 's tomorrow . I just came by to say hi . " <p> " Oh , wow . That 's terrible . I 'm sorry to hear that , man . That 's really a shame . " <p> " Yeah , well , see , I thought I 'd just , you know , show up here , just to put in an appearance , " Suskind said as sweat dripped down his forehead into his eyes . " What with the race on Monday morning and all . Everything 's sort of happening at once right now , and you know , I just think maybe this is n't the night for me to be doing this . See my point ? " he pleaded . " If I 'd known it was this kind of party ... with my mother dying and all  --  you know ? I mean  --  this is an orgy , right ? " He 'd never been to an orgy in his life . He 'd played spin-the-bottle several times in junior high , but that was as close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orgy ? " Randy asked . His face was guileless . " We.just get together and have some fun , man . It 's no big deal . C'm on , man  --  we 're partners , right ? Big race coming up Monday ! Wow , man , I 'm psyched  --  I 've set things up with Sly and Spanky and Neffball and Geezer and Rat  --  we 're ready to go . Temple 's all excited , too . I think she likes you , man , " Randy added , leaning in and whispering . " I did n't think Temple liked anybody . So come on , man ! I mean , wow , that 's awful about your morn . But you know , maybe you need to let your hair down a little . Get down , stay down , have some fun . " <p> Suskind took a couple of deep breaths . What would he be doing if he were at home right now ? Mourning ? Not likely . No , there was a Rory Calhoun retrospective on TNT ( River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Trigger ) , and probably he 'd be glued to the TV set , wolfing down popcorn and feeling sorry for himself . Oh , what the hell , anyway , Suskind told himself . She 's dead , she 's past caring . Staying home and weeping wo n't bring her back . And so , sighing , he gave in , and unbuckled his belt . Then he hopped around for a moment while he tugged off his shoes and socks , and soon he was down to his boxer shorts . He stood there next to the pile of his clothes , one thumb hooked in the elastic band of his underwear , contemplating the situation . He sensed Temple Hodge 's cold eyes roaming over him , and he managed to flash a weak smile in her direction . He could feel a fist pounding ineffectually inside his chest , trying to break out . <p> " Here you go , man , " Randy said , and handed him a shiny silver codpiece . Suskind flipped his boxers down to his ankles and stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codpiece , strapping its absurd thong around his waist under the overhang of his belly . Oh , shit , he thought , this is it  --  a new low . It was as if he 'd discovered a subbasement beneath the cellar of his life . <p> Temple glided across the room with surprising grace for a woman her size . " Glad you decided to stick around , " she purred . " Nobody likes a party pooper . " She held out a pair of handcuffs . " Welcome to the club , Big Fella . Tonight you 're a shackler . " <p> Big Fella ? Suskind swallowed deeply . The cuffs were heavy , made of no-nonsense forged steel . He turned to Randy . " Hey , " he whispered . " Hey , Randy . Can we talk ? " <p> " Not right now , man . " Randy 's eyes glittered . He ran his hands through his dreadlocks . <p> " Listen , are the handcuffs necessary ? " Suskind asked insistently . <p> " Relax . Everybody 's a consenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , man . " <p> " Yeah , but handcuffs ... " <p> " She wants it that way . " <p> " She ? " <p> " Melanie . She 's ripe , man . Melanie 's into some wild stuff . This is her party . It 's her birthday on Tuesday , so she gets to pick the fantasy tonight . She has a thing about rape . " <p> " RAPE ? " Suskind dropped the manacles , just missing his toes . " Oh , no , " he said . " No , no thanks , I do n't think so . Rape is not in my repertoire . Absolutely not . " <p> " She 's into it , man . I 'm telling you , Melanie 's got this major thing . No kidding . " <p> Three other fellows were standing nearby holding handcuffs . Now they looked at him , then at each other . They were Randy 's age , well-muscled and taut , impossibly thin . One had his nipples pierced by metal toothpicks ; another had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their penis sleeves bulged ; Suskind felt sure that his looked limp and inconsequential by comparison . " Hey , old man  --  you in or you out ? " one of them asked . <p> " Somebody have a problem here ? " Temple asked . She 'd taken off the serape , and she approached him tranquilly , cupping her impressive breasts and pointing them up and out , aiming them at him like two loaded torpedoes . They seemed ready to go off at any second . <p> " I do n't know . In , I guess , " Suskind said , afraid for one irrational moment that if he refused , Temple would fire on him , reducing him to smoking wreckage . He picked up his handcuffs and rattled them half-heartedly . " Ready to roll ! " he said , pumping his voice full of false bravado . <p> " All right then , let 's do it , " one of the other shacklers said grimly . " Ready with the cuffs ? A door opened , and pallbearers carried a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four-poster bed . The springs groaned as she hit the mattress and bounced . Her face was pale and plain , dominated by a wide mouth ringed with slightly smeared red lipstick . She wore a thin nightgown , white faded to a dingy yellow . Suskind peered at her , trying to see if she was actually enjoying this  --  but her face , bland and impassive , gave him no clue . The other shacklers bent to their work , and Suskind tried to follow their lead ; but as he touched her left wrist with the cold metal of the cuffs , the young woman suddenly opened her eyes and screamed . Her voice was lusty , operatic , rising and falling in melodic screams that built to a series of crescendos , then subsided as she gathered breath . Suskind backed away blindly , still holding the cuffs in front of him as a peace offering , but she kept on screaming . Another shackler , his face flushed with indignation , snatched the cuffs away and brusquely finished the job . <p> Other partygoers leaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the nightgown . Spread-eagled , the girl bucked and lunged , still screaming , her breasts heaving , belly rippling , the soft , dimpled flesh of her thighs rising off the bed as if she 'd been struck by lightning . Suskind stood by , his palms moist . In spite of himself , his penis asserted itself inside its ridiculous little sleeve . Oh , no  --  God , how embarrassing ! An erection now ? This was worse than getting one that time in eighth grade , just before he had to stand in front of the class and talk about the chief exports of Bolivia ! What did this say about him ? What kind of a pervert was he , anyway ? <p> Everyone was getting involved now , nibbling at the woman 's toes , climbing over one another to suck at her breasts . Temple Hodge stood by the door , beating out a rhythm on a snare and chanting , " Hey-ya , heyya , hey-ya . " The sound reminded Suskind of the idiotic rituals he 'd had to go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made-up gibberish at each other and dancing around a campfire half-naked while mosquitoes feasted on his shins . Actually , now that he considered it , Temple Hodge looked a lot like Mr. Tillinghast , Suskind 's old scoutmaster , who had the largest breasts Suskind had ever seen on a man . But he did n't have time right now to think about Mr. Tillinghast , because over the beat of Temple 's drum and the drone of her chanting , the woman 's screams were rising ever louder . Her eyes had rolled back in their sockets , and he thought he could see froth on her lips . <p> It was the froth that did it . Too much , Suskind told himself . OK , so he 'd had the beginnings of an erection a minute ago  --  he admitted that . And yes , it was true , his mother had just died , and instead of staying home and mourning , or going to the synagogue to say Kaddish for her , he 'd come to this ridiculous party , where he 'd taken off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total strangers could lick her body . But this was too much . Whoever she was , she was somebody 's daughter , somebody 's sister . Hell , maybe she was even somebody 's mother . <p> And so without thinking , Suskind leaped onto the bed with a grunt and stood there unsteadily , straddling the young woman 's body , rocking back and forth on the flimsy mattress as if it were a dinghy lost at sea . He felt his stomach swaying slightly as he shifted his legs to solidify his stance . " OK , the party 's over " he cried . " The next guy that touches her has to come through me . " <p> For a moment , all movement ceased . Then Temple Hodge flung her drum away and stalked over . " No problem , " she said grimly . Then she reached up and punched him in the face . <p> One blow was all it took . Suskind tumbled off the bed onto his side and scooted across the floor . Pain shot through his rib cage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He retreated to a corner to clear the cobwebs . The room was silent now , except for the throb of blood behind his eyes . The young woman splayed across the bed stared at him with a mixture of boredom and resentment . Suskind gazed back at her dazedly . " Are you OK , ma'am ? " he croaked . <p> " You stupid prick , " she replied . " Who the hell invited you , anyway ? " <p> Suskind bit his lip and hung his head . He could feel his right eye start to swell . <p> " You disappoint me , little man , " Temple said . " I thought I liked you , but I was wrong . I 'm almost never wrong , but this time I was . I should have known better . You science geeks are all alike . Next time I see you I 'll run you down like a dog . " <p> " OK , " Suskind said , clambering heavily to his feet . " I admit it , I made a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can take it from the top of page two , ca n't we ? Pretend I never said a word . " <p> " You , " Temple ordered . " Get out . Now . " She pointed a stern finger toward the stairs , and stood frozen in that position until Suskind meekly gathered his clothing and walked to the doorway . He turned around , hoping to catch Randy 's attention . But all he saw was Temple Hodge , stark naked  --  statuesque , pendulous , imperious  --  still pointing sternly , like the archangel at the gates of Eden . <p> 9 It was a beautiful service . Mandelbaum 's Chapel was full to the very back . A cantor , a young fellow Suskind did n't recognize , sang in a rich baritone . Rabbi Futterman 's eulogy said everything about Miriam Suskind that there was to say , and so plainly that everyone wept . He spoke of her childhood in the Bronx , her marriage to Suskind 's father , their move to the West Coast , her work with Hadassah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casket , a plain pine box , stood on a platform at the front , and Suskind could n't keep his eyes off it . It seemed small to him , a child 's casket , perhaps  --  too small for someone who 'd lived to be eightythree . There was no room for the richness of her life in that undersized box . It all must be elsewhere , he told himself , in that place where abundant lives go , to float through the air unencumbered by flesh and blood . <p> At Suskind 's request , Brenda and Nick sat with him in the front row . At first Brenda had balked . " Just out of curiosity : how 'd you get that black eye ? " she asked in a strained whisper , and when he shook his head wearily by way of reply , he saw her lips tighten , and he looked away . " Fine , " she said . " Do n't tell me . I do n't care . " <p> " It happened last night . It 's stupid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes still averted . <p> " You get into a fight or something , Dad ? " Nick asked . <p> " It was a misunderstanding , that 's all . " Suskind reached out and pulled Brenda and Nick toward him . He could smell Brenda 's perfume  --  could it be the same scent she 'd worn when they were married ? " Look , both of you  --  can you forget about last night ? Nothing happened . Can we be a family today ? " he asked . " Just for a while ? I 'm telling you , I need this , I really do . " <p> After the service they rode together in one of Mandelbaum 's limousines , leading a parade of cars through stop-and-go traffic all the way down to Colma , where , under a bright blue sky , Miriam Suskind 's coffin was lowered into the ground . " Ashes to ashes , dust to dust , " Rabbi Futterman intoned , and with his knotty hands he shoveled the first clods of dirt . Then he handed the shovel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fresh soil , raised and upended it , raining dirt down into his mother 's grave . He was shocked by the thud and scattering scramble the clods made as they hit the raw pine . Such a cruel , primitive sound , like something lifted intact from one of the more violent books of the Old Testament . He handed the shovel to Nick , who took his turn , and then the tool was passed down the line from mourner to mourner , until everyone had taken a turn . Then they moved away from the still-gaping hole , weeping , leaving the rest for the cemetery workers . <p> Nick rode in front on the way back to the city , hoping to pick up driving tips from a professional . In the backseat Suskind and Brenda leaned their heads together and sighed . " So you got into a fight , huh ? " she said . " I did n't think you were the type . " <p> " A guy 's got to do what a guy 's got to do , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was silent . A moment later he asked , " I do n't want to press you , but have you thought any more about Nick ? About letting him come live with me , I mean ? Forget about this black eye . It 's a once-in-a-lifetime thing , I promise you . I do n't want to put any pressure on you about this . I was just wondering if you 'd thought about it at all . " <p> " I do n't know , " she moaned . " I go back and forth day by day . Today , for instance  --  he 's being an angel . This morning he told me he loved me . It 's been a while since he 's said that . What can I tell you ? When he 's like that , I think to myself , How could I ever consider sending him to the city to live ? Even for a week at a time ? " <p> " But the other night  --  " <p> " The other night he was driving me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-year-old cooking sherry under the sink , and I poured myself three fingers and slugged it down . I almost choked to death . Listen , I think I should take it a day at a time for a while . I should n't have said anything . I was in a bad way . " <p> " Wait a second  --  wait a second , " he said in a desperate voice . He felt an invisible rope sliding like silk through his helpless grasp . " Maybe  --  maybe we could work something out  --  some sort of compromise . You know , shared custody . Lots of people do that . " <p> " Oh , I do n't know , " said Brenda wearily . " You want to go through that whole thing again , with lawyers and such ? I hated all that . The problem is , how 's he going to get from Walnut Creek to San Francisco ? That 's a long commute . " <p> " There 's BART . He could ride in , I could drive him back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his learner 's permit . He 's not a little kid anymore . " <p> " You want our son driving over the Bay Bridge ? I do n't think so . " <p> " So I 'll move to Walnut Creek , " Suskind said , bearing down on her . <p> " I 'll rent a place in your neighborhood . Listen : I 'll do whatever it takes . " <p> " I do n't know , Elliot . Let 's talk about it more sometime soon , OK ? <p> I do n't want to make any hasty decisions . " <p> " But in the meantime , there 's a chance this is going to work out , is n't there , " he said . It was n't a question , it was a statement  --  though not necessarily a statement of fact , he realized . <p> Brenda gazed at his face without a hint of romance in her eyes . She traced the outline of his shiner with an index finger  --  her touch so soft that Suskind had to concentrate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell happened to you last night ? " she asked . <p> 10 At nine-thirty the next morning , Suskind prowled the museum 's corridors with morose intensity , like a man on his way to the gas chamber . He 'd held out hope , a tattered shred , until this morning , when he arrived at his cubicle and listened to Temple Hodge 's barking message . " About the race this morning : no can do , " she said . " Something 's come up  --  I 'm sure you understand . I do wish we could have worked something out . But you know how it is . Well , so long , now . " <p> Workmen were still readying the dozens of displays around the exhibition hall , and Suskind was grateful for the ceaseless din of last-minute hammering and sawing , which made it difficult , at least momentarily , for him to attend to the downward spiral of his thoughts . But then his thoughts simply increased their volume , and he was ' forced to listen . The race was off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festivities were ruined . Following that train of thought one more step brought him to the unemployment line  --  which in turn meant there 'd likely be no evenings spent supervising Nick 's homework , no weekends of father-son bonding , no , none of that at all . Oh , yes : Suskind the impresario was back in business , all right . <p> He looked out a window across the spacious front lawn , toward the sunlight dancing on the water of the bay . Eucalyptus trees swayed in the breeze , along with strings of multicolored balloons . Visitors milled about ; there might be two hundred people already here , he estimated  --  maybe more . Crews from several TV stations had set up their lights around the stage area , and thick electrical cables snaked everywhere along the grass . Children ran through the crowd in swarms , some of them squealing with laughter . What were they doing here ? Did n't they know this was a disaster area  --  that they were playing in a minefield , a toxic waste dump ? Did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to lose his job ? <p> Doug Escobar tapped him on the shoulder , breaking his reverie . " Elliot . Speak to me . The race  --  where are the racers ? Where 's the finish line ? I do n't see  --  " <p> " Oh , hi there , Doug , " Suskind said . " Some morning , is n't it ? " He tried a smile , but it died on his lips . " I guess we have to talk , Doug-o . " <p> " Maybe you think I 'm being unreasonable here . Maybe I 'm just supposed to stand by and do nothing . Do you know how long my staff and I have been working on the exhibition ? " Escobar asked . " I 'll tell you : two years . I 've never worked harder on anything in my life . I poured my heart into this thing . I poured everything I know into it , and everything I 've learned . I 'm talking about my career . My career . Do you understand what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your eye ? " <p> " Well , that 's kind of a long story . " <p> " Then I do n't want to hear about it . When 's the bicycle race starting ? " <p> " Well , see , that 's the thing , Doug . See , my mother was in the hospital  --  " <p> " Stop . I 'm very sorry about your mother . I repeat : when 's the race starting ? " <p> " See , everything was all set to go . It really was . " <p> " Answer the question . WHEN . . . IS . . . THE . . . RACE . . . STARTING ? I 'm warning you . " <p> But it was too late now for warnings . Suskind was prepared to go all the way , right on down the line , even if it meant taking off his clothes and showing Escobar where his penis sleeve had tied around his belly . He was ready to lie on his back , spread his legs , and start screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the hell , he told himself , and began to flail away at his buttons . <p> But just as he got to the third shirt button , a large gray van pulled onto the lawn and screeched to a halt , scattering some tourists . Suskind stopped what he was doing and watched with horrid fascination . The driver 's door swung open , and Sol Zeldin hopped out , his head wreathed in smoke . Another van pulled up , then another , and another . Out poured a battalion of old Jewish men , not one of them more than five-and-a-half feet tall . Zeldin waved his arms , and his band of dwarves began to haul large wire cages from the vans , one after another , working with surprising grace and coordination for men their age , until there were twelve cages on the lawn . Even through the glass doors of the museum , Suskind could hear the cooing . <p> " Elliot ? " Escobar demanded . " What is this ? Hello ? Elliot ? Talk to me . Do n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . " <p> " Sit tight  --  I 'll be right back , " Suskind said , and walked outside . As he neared the gathering of old men , the pigeons ' cooing coalesced into something louder , a blanket of sound that rose and thrummed in the air over his head . " Mr. Zeldin , " he called out . <p> Zeldin shook his head sorrowfully . " Oh , Mr. Suskind , am I glad to see you . My deepest regrets over the death of your mother . What can I tell you ? This was such a person ! I wish I 'd gotten to know her  --  I hear such wonderful things . I hope you 're holding up OK under the burden of your loss . My friend Futterman tells me I missed his best eulogy in thirty-five years . I feel terrible about this  --  the debt I owe that man ! I 'm sorry I was n't able to be there , but you got to understand , a show like this one takes time to put together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all at once he understood . " Oh  --  oh no , you did n't . Mr. Zeldin , no . Please . " <p> Zeldin gestured toward the elderly joskies now loitering by the vans . " I had to round up pigeons from all over this half of the state . Those long-distance phone calls ! Do n't worry  --  I can afford it , believe me . I got Sprint . Anyway , for homing pigeons , it 's worth it . And look what we got . " He swept a hand in a broad arc . " Everybody came . Is that something ? I sent out the word , and look at them all  --  here , there . They remembered your father : Suskind , I told them  --  the genius from ladies ' shoesl " He paused and leaned closer ; Suskind could smell the tobacco on his breath . " By the way , if you do n't mind my mentioning it , " Zeldin added in a hoarse whisper , " that 's a nice-looking shiner you got there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he supposed to say ? The eye did n't hurt anymore ; it had turned the vibrant color of an eggplant , and the swelling had receded a bit . The bruise gave his round , boneless face some character . He 'd admired it that morning in the mirror , and he hoped it would stick around a while . He 'd earned it the hard way , after all . <p> " Well , we 'll be set in a few minutes , " Zeldin told him . " If you do n't mind , you could move the crowd back , so everybody can stand clear , and then we 'll let the pigeons do all the work . " <p> " You 're determined to go through with this , are n't you ? " Suskind said . Again he envisioned pigeon shit raining down on innocent men , women , and children , all of whom had expected to see a thrilling bicycle race . " I ca n't talk you out of it ? You 're sure ? " <p> " Talk me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe me , you 're going to love it . " <p> " Well , fine , then . It does n't matter , anyway , " said Suskind . He shrugged in resignation . " I 'll be right back . " He went inside and located Escobar in the staff lounge , where he was busy stuffing saltines into his mouth by the handful . " Doug , we 've had a small change in plans , " Suskind began . <p> Escobar looked up furtively , then went back to his box of crackers . <p> " Instead of the race , we 're doing something even better , Doug . It 's my backup plan . You should always have a backup plan for something like this . Homing pigeons . " <p> " What about homing pigeons ? " Escobar demanded . He sprayed crumbs on the " p " of " pigeons . " <p> " Well  --  you 'll just have to wait and see . It 's a surprise , " said Suskind . How the hell was he supposed to know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to like it , " he added . <p> Escobar crammed another fistful of saltines into his mouth and waved Suskind away . " Get away from me . You 're a criminal . You 're incompetent . You 'll pay for this , " he cried , spraying more crumbs into the air . <p> Suskind walked back outside . The old man reached into his van and grabbed a stepladder and a cordless microphone . He stepped up on the highest rung , switched on the mike , and called out to the people milling about on the lawn . " Hello there , everybody . What a beautiful day we got for this , is n't it ? Welcome to the opening of my friend Elliot Suskind 's big new show , Remembering the Way . Such a smart boy  --  he 's got some head on his shoulders ! His parents , may they rest in peace , would be so proud of him today . " <p> Suskind put his head down between his shoulders at this point , inched his way to the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , do n't let Doug Escobar hear any of this , he prayed . <p> " We 've got a lot of homing pigeons with us here today , " Zeldin continued . " Pigeons from all over the Bay Area , even beyond . They tell me they 're very glad to be here , and they want to show everybody what wonderful little birds they are . They all want to go home for lunch . And we 're gon na let them do it . So just stand back a bit , and these beautiful little sweetheart pigeons are going to put on a show for you . " <p> Zeldin motioned the old joskies working behind him , gathered in a clearing at the middle of the lawn , readying the cages . " Here we have the group from the Noe Valley Homing Pigeon Club  --  Irving Tessler , President . These birds get to take it easy today  --  they do n't have far to fly . How we doing down there , Irving ? " he asked , and a dapper little fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Zeldin said , and a moment later a cage sprung open , letting a dozen pigeons flutter into the air . A smattering of applause washed through the crowd as the birds flew in a lazy circle overhead for a few seconds before angling sharply toward the southwest . <p> Another cage was brought forward . " Here 's the birds from Sausalito , " Zeldin announced . " Barney  --  whenever you 're ready . " The latch sprung open , and again the crowd burst into applause as the birds took flight . Suskind watched the Sausalito pigeons circling cautiously , searching for landmarks , before they formed a loose pattern and winged northward . " Look at them fly , ladies and gentlemen ! They 'll be home in ten minutes . And they wo n't have to pay any tolls to get there , either , " Zeldin cried . <p> Arthur Wexler came out the front door of the museum and loped toward Suskind . " Elliot  --  what 's going on ? Doug Escobar 's in there crying . He 's unhinged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and gazed at the sky . " Oh , gosh , " he said . " Wait a second . What are they  --  homing pigeons ? They 're so beautiful . Oh , Elliot . this is something . Escobar ought to get a load of this . Is this your idea ? This is brilliant . Look at them fly . " <p> Petaluma , Santa Cruz , Stockton , Napa  --  Zeldin directed his crew to release one group of pigeons , then another . The applause faded after the fourth explosion of flapping wings , and everyone fell nearly silent , except for soft " Aaahs , " as one small flock and then the next and the next were set free . Zeldin said nothing more now , except to announce the towns and cities the birds called home : Los Gatos , Saratoga , Half Moon Bay , Ukiah , Sacramento . The only sounds were the metallic spring of cages as they were opened , the murmurs of " Aaah " and " Ohhh , " and then the rapid flurry , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child , a little boy , up in the air . He had short blond hair and wore a sailor 's suit , and he shielded his eyes against the sun as he watched the flock of pigeons flutter away in the sky . Wexler grabbed Suskind 's sleeve and motioned . " Oh , sweet Jesus , " he said . " Look at that kid . " Suskind shut his eyes for a moment , swept under by a wave of regret so strong he thought he might drown in it . He 'd hoped that Brenda and Nicky could be here today  --  but then , who was he kidding ? Hope for whatever you like , he told himself grimly  --  hope is free . Suskind knew very well that there were no miracles in the world ; yes , it was true , Rabbi Futterman was still alive , and that was pretty damned amazing . Perhaps he 'd clung to life all these years just so he could deliver the eulogy at Miriam Suskind 's funeral . But thoughts of kindly , doddering old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rabbi 's ominous warning all those years ago : If the mistake you make is bad enough ... <p> He turned back and searched for the boy in the sailor suit , but the child had disappeared , and there was nothing left to look at but the pigeons . So Suskind lifted his head and opened his mouth in wonder ; and for what must have been quite a while , the birds were all that mattered . Zeldin called them , one group , then another , then another . Lodi , Modesto , Rohnert Park , Calistoga , Healdsburg . The cages sprung open , and Suskind watched with everyone else as flock after flock of pigeons spiraled up in graceful masses of black and white and gray , floating into the sky like ashes , circling unsteadily overhead as if unsure of where to go . Then one by one they remembered , and flew off toward home . <p> <p> By GERALD SHAPIRO <p>
