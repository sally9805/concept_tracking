Monica Grant reached for a final book to add to the stack in her arms . She picked it up , skimmed the back-cover copy , then replaced it on the shelf . It was set in the Caribbean . She 'd already chosen one story set there , plus several others that were set abroad . No , she mused , pensively studying the display before her , she was in the mood for something American , something contemporary , something dramatic . She pondered two other books before settling on a third and tucking it into the crook of her arm with the rest . Then she stole a glance to either side of her . To her relief the aisle was still empty . The bookstore itself was nearly deserted . There was a browser one row to the left in Games and Hobbies , another two rows to the right in Psychology , and several others scattered along the far Non-Fiction rack , She had Romance all to herself . With a smile of satisfaction she snapped up a magazine to camouflage the selections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ambled toward the best-sellers . A first and a second , each by authors she hoped to interview during their forthcoming publicity stops in Boston , topped the pile . Then , with another cautious glance around , she headed for the cash register . Luck was on her side . There was only she and the clerk , a studious-looking young man who tactfully rang up her sales without commenting on either her choices or the sheepish look she was trying so hard to suppress . She half-wished he 'd ask , then she might tell him the tale of her friend in the hospital who was hopelessly addicted to love stories . But he did n't ask , and she left well enough alone . It was only when thebooks were all safely tucked into a bag and hidden from public view that she dared look the clerk in the eye . " Thank you . " She smiled more comfortably . He nodded . " Come again . " " I will , " she said and knew that she would . Next week , next month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 'd be back . Clutching her treasures to her breast , Monica stepped out into the bright midmorning sunshine , took a deep breath of pleasure , and turned to head for home . But just as quickly the breath was knocked from her lungs when a body barreled into her , throwing her against the concrete wall of the building . Stunned , she slid to the sidewalk , oblivious to the shouts around her until one deep voice came through , close by her ear . " Are you all right , miss ? " She gasped in the struggle to catch her breath but did n't move from where she sat slumped against the wall , her legs curled beneath her , her arms gripping herself and her belongings protectively . Her head was bowed , sending curled ribbons of light brown hair cascading over her face like a screen , behind which she slowly regained her composure . " Miss ? " The deep voice came again , and a gentle hand drew back her hair . " Are you hurt ? " Eyes still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think so , " she whispered , but already she felt a stinging in her forehead , another in her shoulder . " Can you stand up ? Again she shook her head . " Give me a minute . " Her rescuer held her arm lightly as he reached into his shirt pocket . " Here , press this to your head . " Without a pause he did it himself . " You 've scraped your temple . It does n't look serious . Anything else hurt ? " Lifting a shaky hand , she relieved his hand and pressed the handkerchief to her temple . " My shoulder . " Only then did she open her eyes to examine the damage herself . It might have helped if it had been winter and she had been bundled up to the hilt . But this was the middle of June , it was hot , and she wore a bare sundress that had offered no protection when she 'd hit the wall . Her shoulder was badly scraped , and she could begin to imagine what her forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She gave it a try and grimaced but succeeded . " It 's okay . Just messy , I guess . " Then she caught sight of the crowd gathered around in a semicircle and winced with distaste . " Okay , folks . " Her attendant understood instantly that she needed privacy and gestured toward the crowd . " Move on now . She 's all right . " When she heard the note of authority in his voice , Monica looked up for the first time at the man who 'd come to her aid . He had crouched down beside her , one knee braced on the sidewalk . He wore navy-blue pants , matching navy shirt with a badge on the breast pocket and the departmental insignia on its sleeve , and the standard patrolman 's hat . Had it not been for the surprisingly warm depth of his brown-eyed gaze she might have stiffened on pure reflex . Instead she could only stare for a perplexed moment before gathering her strength to stand up . He was right beside her , lending his firm support with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist . When it appeared that her legs would hold her , he released her . " Better ? " His voice was as deep and as warm as his gaze . " A little shaky ... but , yes . " She dabbed her forehead with the clean handkerchief he 'd given her , folded it over , then replaced it on the swelling bruise . " I suppose I 'll have a whopper of a headache later . " She laughed weakly , feeling strangely self-conscious . " What hit me , anyway ? " Chancing a glance past him , she saw that the crowd had dispersed , leaving no sign of a guilty party . " A pickpocket " came the quiet reply . Monica 's eyes widened in disbelief as she raised them to meet the more penetrating gaze of the policeman . " The pickpocket ? " His lips twitched . " Unless my buddy catches him , we 'll never know , will we ? " She followed the link of his sight up the street ...        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
