Gail Haynes , surrounded by children from her parish , found reform and support through the Church of Gethsemane , which was started by a group of female exoffenders in Brooklyn . // We already know that many of our communities are in crisis . Instead of complaining or blaming , it 's time we asked , What 's the plan ? What will it take to make our neighborhoods safer ? To make the twilight of our elders ' lives easier ? To ensure that we have the world we 've all envisioned ? As these profiles of social activism show , it takes a commitment to a cause . And more of us are helping our people-35 percent of Blacks reported volunteering in a 1996 survey by the Independent Sector , which tracks such activities nationwide . Often it is only a few hands that raise us all . The next time you see a need , perhaps one of those hands will be yours . A A LIFELINE TO PRISONS Throughout her teenage years , Gail Haynes was a veteran of the street , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostituted herself to cop her fixes . By age 17 , she started the first of many stints in New York prisons . And up until last year , her husband and three children knew her as the shadowy figure who dropped in rarely and randomly . Ten years ago , during one of those appearances , Haynes took her children to a Christmas party at the Church of Gethsemane ( pronounced geth-SIM-an-ee ) , which she 'd learned about through friends , in Brooklyn . A church that serves people in the penal system , particularly women , Gethsemane reached out to the Hayneses . " They helped my kids when I could n't , giving them those hugs , sending them to camp , " says Haynes , now 46 . She was a harder case , her visits to Gethsemane usually followed by a race back to the street . But church elders never gave up on her ; their warm welcomes were followed by stern talks . It was during one of those talks with Gethsemane Minister Phyllis Zoon last year , as Haynes sat in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wanted a different life . Gethsemane grew out of the prison ministry of former head minister Connie Baugh . Many of those she guided behind bars returned to her for religious rites once they got out of jail because they felt shunned by traditional churches . They finally asked Baugh , a Presbyterian minister , to help them start a church . In 1985 a group of 11 female ex-offenders started meeting in a brownstone in East Harlem . By 1986 they had a Presbyterian charter and began looking for a church home . The women discovered one in Brooklyn , an almost abandoned sanctuary in the well-kept Park Slope neighborhood . But they soon found themselves the target of " not in my backyard " protests . They prevailed , going to civic meetings and refuting negative press reports , until the community calmed down . They named their church Gethsemane for the place where Jesus was arrested . Now every Sunday the white stucco walls and oak pews rock with the stirring hymns of 40 to 70 congregants-many are former convicts ; some are homeless or addicts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " explains Helene Means , a founding member and ex-offender . " They help you build for the future . " Gethsemane 's most amazing grace is JusticeWorks , a group within the church that relentlessly advocates for those in the penal system . Eighty-four percent of incarcerated women are jailed for drug-related crimes . Since 1992 , JusticeWorks has held Mother 's Day rallies to protest stiff sentencing and to push for treatment alternatives to prison . The changes they seek to effect would keep the women from being separated from their children . Other efforts include repealing the death penalty and returning the right to vote to prisoners and ex-convicts , who lose that honor in many states . The church also maintains contact with incarcerated men and women ; it has 35 inmates as corresponding members of the congregation . The newly released come to Gethsemane for housing , jobs and service referrals as well as food and clothing donations . And rather than leave their fate up to haphazard public defenders , inmates and ex-cons can turn to JusticeWorks for parole board referrals and courtroom legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her earlier lifestyle : She now has AIDS and spends a lot of her time in anger-management classes . But she and her husband are rebuilding their marriage and her three children , now 17 , 19 and 22 years old , are high achievers . Every Sunday reminds her how far she has come . When she first wanted to become a deacon , she was voted down because of her irresponsible living . Now sober , she 's made the cut . And so the once-wayward sheep now shepherds others . " Before I could n't help anyone because I could n't help me , " she says . " But now I 've earned the right to give back . " OUR ELDERS KEEPERS Eva Davis speaks with a halting voice and knitted brow as she recalls her misfortunes over the past four years . " They took my house away , " she says , referring to the mortgage company she believes swindled her out of the home she once owned . After she moved to a new place , thieves cleaned her out . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she laments . She also has asthma , and a failed hip replacement sometimes makes walking painful . But with all her troubles , Davis finds a smile for Bernice Colbert , one of 55 volunteers for the Network for Elders . Since 1989 , this coalition has helped seniors live with dignity in Bayview Hunter 's Point , one of San Francisco 's most economically depressed neighborhoods . Davis is typical of the more than 300 clients the Network serves . At 60 , she lives alone on a limited income . She does n't have a car , and all too often her medical problems mean trips to doctors on the other side of town . That 's where Colbert and her 1983 maroon-and-white Cadillac come in . She laughs as she talks about maneuvering that big Caddy : " I say God gave it to me , we gon na use it ! " Colbert 's high energy belies the fact that at age 74 she has recovered from two strokes . But she 's still able to drive other seniors to appointments and errands . Colbert has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3-Com Park , the stadium where the 49ers and the Giants play-for 43 years . She signed on as a Network volunteer in 1989 , but now she is also a Network client . " They were trying to take my house , " she says , " but I brought the papers here and the Network helped me save it . " Beverly Taylor , the Network 's volunteer manager , says that , like Colbert , the organization 's 15 most dependable volunteers are also clients . The Network grew out of a coalition of people who saw the need to help elders become independent . It educates the public about services available for seniors , delivers monthly food boxes to the homebound , holds seminars on topics like pain management and arthritis treatments and organizes volunteers to do home repairs and yard work . " Our primary clients are seniors who own their own homes , " says Shireen McSpadden , executive director of the Network .

Bayview also has one of the largest senior populations in the city . " People lose their homes frequently here , " McSpadden says . " We 've been able to keep that from happening . " In this group , anyone can be a decision maker ; by attending three meetings and paying dues of one dollar or more , you become a member and have a vote . " We want to empower elders , " says the Network 's mission statement . And it does . GUIDING YOUNG MASTERS OF ART There was a time when you could pick any wall , billboard or subway station in Boston and chances are Sanmartin Figueroa had tried to destroy it . At 17 , Figueroa , who by age 8 had begun scrawling his tag name , Mart , with fat markers on whatever property he could , is a repentant vandal .

A teacher , Janaya Majied-Janey , coaxed him into staying in school , providing a safe place for him and other young brothers to do their " graf . " " I was into a lot of illegal things , " says Figueroa , a Puerto Rican high-school senior whose caramel-colored skin reflects his African heritage . " I used to roll with the wrong crowd : gangbangers , everything . " Majied-Janey took Figueroa under her wing when he was a sixth grader , after he enrolled in the school where she taught-the Martin Luther King Jr . Middle School in Boston 's Dorchester section . Back then he was a major disciplinary problem to all but Majied-Janey , who shared his taste and talent for art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with troubled kids , had asked her if Figueroa could attend her art class . Before she knew it , Majied-Janey , a mother of five who speaks in a soft , firm voice , began guiding other young Black and Latino brothers who , like Figueroa , were beginning to amass thick juvenile records . Today the boys are known in Boston and nationally as members of the Young Graffiti Masters ( YGM ) , an antiviolence program that channels their creative skills to positive and often profitable enterprises like painting murals for private firms , state-financed billboards and city-owned properties . Their brightly colored scenes include a stunning depiction of Boston 's skyline at a downtown advertising firm , a seascape of exotic fish at a swimming pool and children playing with toys on a school wall . For Majied-Janey , the goal was simple : to affirm the boys ' talents while helping them mature into young men who take responsibility for their actions . " A lot of these kids were misunderstood by the establishment , and as a consequence , they misunderstood themselves , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would pile her charges into her family 's car , ferry them to assignments and feed them with funds entirely out of her own pocket . The program , which now relies on grants and commissions , dispatches young brothers to a number of sites each month , to beautify a corner office or prepare a mural for a gala opening . The boys meet Majied-Janey every day after school at a city-owned community center . They take off for work once they complete their homework . There were times , Majied-Janey says , when she prayed for strength to balance her own family 's needs with those of her adopted family , not to mention the needs of her students . " I looked at YGM as a mission that was given to me , " she says . In 1997 , YGM produced a canvas for First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton . The previous year , they painted a canvas promoting peace for U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno , who praised the program as one that serves kids who are beyond the reach of traditional youth programs .

Their pieces have also been auctioned off for hundreds of dollars each . Fame aside , Figueroa 's change of attitude may be the best measure of the program 's success . " It has helped me focus on art , not just graffiti , " he says . " And all that gang stuff , I 've left behind . " - ZACHARY DOWDY CITIZEN CRIME FIGHTERS Between the latest hip-hop favorites and a stream of R &B; and oldies , 19-year-old Melissa Robinson can be heard most nights on Kansas City 's top-rated radio station , KPRS-FM , urging teen runaways to go home . Robinson 's no deejay ; she 's the runaway prevention and intervention coordinator for the Ad Hoc Group Against Crime , a group organized 22 years ago to fight crime and improve communications between the Kansas City , Missouri , police department and Black residents . One of the group 's latest projects is helping police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're surprised at the number of young people we are able to reach , " says Robinson , who , along with other members of the Ad Hoc Group , calls into KPRSFM each night to encourage young people to resist peer pressure . " We hit them CONTINUED ON PAGE 153 at a time when we know many young people are listening . " Photograph Leaders of the Ad Hoc Group Against Crime in Kansas City , Missouri ( from left ) : Aasim Baheyadeen , Melissa Robinson , Vivian Jones , Alvin Brooks , Annette Johnson and Alfred Lomax. // In addition to tending to runawaysRobinson says the group tracks about 100 cases a month-the Ad Hoc Group runs 11 other community-outreach programs , including conflict resolution and mediation , mentoring , juvenile crime prevention and financial and moral support for families of murder victims . But it is perhaps best known for its highly visible tactics : Some of its 100 volunteers have been known to picket suspected drug houses and drug-selling liquor stores , and to hold candlelight prayer vigils for the slain . Since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved a model of community empowerment , singled out for praise by President George Bush . But it began out of anger , when , 22 years ago , nine Black women were murdered in a manner suggesting the work of a serial killer . The police investigation appeared stalled , and Black residents were outraged . Alvin Brooks , 66 , the group 's founder and longtime president , who was then an assistant city manager , invited several Black police officers to a community meeting . And , of course , the residents vented their anger . But Brooks , who had been a policeman for ten years , knew the value of mediating between citizens and the police . He 'd even written his master 's thesis on nontraditional organizations that act as intermediaries in crises , theorizing that such agents " reduced tension between two groups and thus minimized social disorder . " The meetings continued after the crimes were solved , and the Ad Hoc Group Against Crime was born . Since then , the group has been credited with reducing tensions between the Black community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes through its 24-hour secret-information telephone hot line . The group has grown up . It now has a 29-member board of directors-a cross section of teachers , parents , day workers and corporate leaders-that sets policy and raises funds . Donations from businesses , foundations , government and individuals help support an $800,000-a-year budget , part of which pays 13 staff members . About $10,000 to $12,000 is given each year to hot-line callers . Despite its growth , Ad Hoc , which operates out of a refurbished bank building on the city 's East Side , retains its grassroots connection , says Brooks . From heading off fistfights to holding monthly community meetings with the police , no problem seems too small for the group to tackle . " Every urban community , regardless of race , needs some kind of Ad Hoc Group that does n't see police as adversaries or enemies , " Brooks says . " Most progressive police departments will welcome and accept that . " GLENN E. RICE A LOAN AND A PRAYER Colette Youngblood dreamed of building a business that cared for toddlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative and mother of a teenage daughter , she wanted to open an intergenerational day-care campus on a farm near her home in Prince George 's County , Maryland . She and her husband , William , a business development manager for a computer company , created a business plan but still had a hard time getting bank executives to share their faith . " They liked the concept , but when it came time to commit , they backed off , " Youngblood says . Her pastor , the Reverend Jonathan Weaver of Greater Mount Nebo A.M.E. Church in Upper Marlboro , Maryland , told her about The Collective Banking Group , Inc . He had helped found CBG in 1993 with several other pastors in the Washington , D.C. , area to help their congregations get small-business loans , mortgages and other lines of credit at preferred interest rates . Youngblood was still skeptical , but in May 1996 , she contacted Harbor Bank of Maryland , a predominantly Black bank based in Baltimore that was working with the collective . Within a week , three executives came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In January 1997 the Youngbloods opened Sycamore Hill , a 12-bedroom assisted living center for senior citizens . The center marked the first phase of a $2 million project that will include separate day-care centers for adults and children . " We knew it would work , " she says . " We just needed someone to believe in us . " The couple came to the bank well prepared and were willing to pledge their own money , says Sheila Lawson , Harbor Bank 's senior loan officer . But they also had the power of The Collective Banking Group . Since it started , the collective has grown from 18 to 180 churches in the D.C. area , representing more than 240,000 parishioners . In the first two years , churches deposited over $15 million into four participating banks . Those banks loaned members of the collective more than $60 million . In 1997 about 60 Baltimore-area churches started a chapter , and churches in more than a dozen other cities in the United States and South Africa have contacted Weaver , president of the collective , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collective and their members are encouraged to transfer their accounts to participating banks . In return , they may CONTINUED ON PAGE IS$ receive special consideration when applying for mortgages or small-business loans . Weaver hopes to empower churches and congregations . " They 're not going up against some monolithic institution , " he says . " They 're going with the strength and power of more than 200,000 people . " The collective struggled at first . The churches contacted and interviewed 18 banks in and around Washington , D.C. , looking at their lending records and at the number of Blacks in management on their staffs . After extensive interviews , the collective drafted an agreement it called a covenant for the banks to sign . It called for a CBG member to serve on the participating bank boards and required the banks to provide the best prevailing interest rates on deposits and loans to churches and their members . It also required that the banks tell the CBG the number of loans its members sought and , of those , how many were approved and denied and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including Harbor and Black-owned Industrial and Enterprise Federal Savings banks . Riggs Bank , NA , was the only White-owned institution to join initially . The program 's success has given the CBG the luxury of having other banks contact it to join . Last year it interviewed eight banks and selected two more White-owned banks to participate . As for Colette Youngblood , the same banks that turned her down are now interested , thanks to the CBG . " It 's opened many doors , " she says . " It has truly been a blessing . " To find out how to form a collective , contact The Collective Banking Group 's executive director , Bruce J. Martin , P.O.
