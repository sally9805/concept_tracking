War , we are shocked to discover , is not a video game . Seduced by the antiseptic green glimmers of smart bombs and high-altitude jet jockeys flickering across TV screens , we 'd come to consider international conflict little more than the quick thrill of bloodless lightning victories . This war is not like that . This war is the ruthless reduction of Kosovo : mass expulsion , killing , burned villages , the obliteration of a people 's identity . This war is American soldiers  --  Staff Sergeant Andrew Ramirez , Staff Sergeant Christopher Stone , Specialist 4 Steven Gonzales  --  captured , humiliated , perhaps tried , perhaps killed . This war is sophisticated supertech airplanes dropping tons of ordnance night after night that fail to stop the enemy 's rifle-toting soldiers . This war is Slobodan Milosevic , cleverer and crueler than planners expected , so far getting the better of NATO . <P> Disagreements would not erupt in war , Winston Churchill said , unless the other side also believed it could win . The strongman of Serbia has once again confounded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to fold . He ceded the skies to NATO , letting the bombs and missiles rain down while barely activating his air defenses . Meanwhile , on the ground , his army pursued two-pronged tactics : pushing tens of thousands of Albanian Kosovars out of the country and engaging in a murderous offensive against the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army . <P> And Milosevic seemed to be winning , at least by his peculiar calculus . He has foisted a barbarous humanitarian crisis upon his neighbors and the European continent . The sight of thousands upon thousands of dazed , weeping refugees fleeing for their lives into the region 's poorest , least stable states set off shock waves in the West . The states themselves  --  particularly Macedonia and Montenegro  --  trembled at the very real possibility that Kosovo 's instability was contagious . <P> The wonder weapons of air power looked futile against primitive " ethnic cleansers " with guns . The long-threatened bombing campaign failed to deter the rape of Kosovo and even appeared to be speeding it . Publicly , NATO insisted that the blame for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombs . But privately , officials offered a line that made more sense alongside the awful images . Military planners lamented that bad weather , clever Serb tactics , White House worries about collateral damage  --  and a reluctance to risk pilots ' lives  --  kept them from hitting at Milosevic as hard as they wished . And diplomats complained that the limp military effort was n't bringing the Serbs to heel fast enough . " You want to know the truth ? " asked a senior State Department official who had urged a tougher assault against Milosevic . " We do n't think we 've accomplished anything . " That frustration , in part , led NATO to speed up the pace of its bombing , to launch a precision cruise-missile attack that set key ministries in the heart of Belgrade aflame Saturday morning , to plan a massive pounding over the Easter weekend and to prepare for a much broader campaign  --  one that will look less like a video game and an awful lot like conventional declared war .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
