<p> These are glory days for American democracy . Congress is in an uproar , the wavering White House is acquiring a new sense of direction , and the American voter may soon be treated to a real campaign . <p> The Democrats are acting like old-fashioned Democrats . " Soak the rich " - a phrase born in 1934 to blast F.D.R. 's embrace of Huey Long populism - is the new battle cry of suddenly unabashed liberals . <p> Having suckered President Bush into abandoning his no-tax firewall , Democrats have shifted the focus of the budget debate away from spending and onto the source of more taxes . <p> They call this " the fairness issue . " A central tenet of liberalism is government 's guarantee that everyone , working or not , needy or not , is entitled to what politicians decide is a fair share of what the nation produces . <p> Republicans traditionally grumble that this classic , straightforward demagoguery encourages " class warfare , " turning rich against poor . They get defensive when charged with standing for vested property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party of the people . " <p> But these self-conscious conservatives miss the point of politics in an age of affluence . The fairness issue has been turned on its head . Most people think of themselves as closer to being rich than to being poor , and consider it unfair to carry all those unproductive others on their backs . <p> When these more-rich-than-poor Americans utter such sentiments , old-fashioned liberals deride them not only for being selfish but racist to boot . This swells the ranks of conservatives , because most voters are not so motivated and resent politicians who make them feel guilty . <p> Therefore , Republicans should not fear class warfare ; the almost-rich far outnumber the almost-poor , and most of the people in the middle tend to identify with the almost-rich , whom they want to become . <p> Moreover , most people now know that the target of taxers has to be the middle-class pocket ; squeezing the richies may be egalitarian fun but is not where the big money is . <p> What happens if you surtax millionaire incomes by 10 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jewelry , as the House liberals suggested ? The budget deficit might be reduced by 2 percent , not counting the losses to the Treasury of taxes from people prevented from selling luxury items . <p> The hidden tax increase in that liberal budget proposal is to reinstate " tax bracket creep " - using inflation to automatically increase tax rates . That 's $36 billion out of middle-class pockets for one year 's creep ; prevent indexing for five years , as would surely follow , and you achieve the liberal dream of " fairness " - redistributing income on a grand scale . <p> The Republican President , chastened by a whopping drop in support after waffling on the central promise of his campaign , says he would veto that bill . That fat and easy target will never reach his desk ; Senate Democrats are taking a slightly more sober route of taxing booze and gas . <p> But whatever budget the Democratic Congress passes , its philosophical approach to the deficit will be new taxes in this " in " year and pious promises of reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tax now , cut spending later . <p> This liberal approach will pass over the objections of most of the Republican minority in Congress . Such dissent is healthy ; if it means that the Government shuts nonessential services for a while , that will dramatize the depth of disagreement and bring the voters to the polls . <p> The only way the minority will become a majority is to draw an issue of principle . Within the Administration , Mr. Bush 's Stolypin , Jack Kemp , soldiers on in loyal silence , but in Congress , the Republican minority must hold the Bob Packwood line on tax rates and align itself with the majority opinion in the nation . Where will it all end ? Is n't compromise the name of the game ? The game 's name is political purpose . Compromise should be struck after the will of the people has been expressed . Let Mr. Bush veto the taxation budget , let the Republicans uphold the veto , and let us use this election as a referendum on taxing vs. spending . <p> The current impasse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is the overdue surfacing of basic political difference . <p> A closed-down Government on Election Day would bring out anti-incumbent voters in force . Candidates , take your positions : tax and service reductions vs. tax and service increases . Duck that in your spots and feel the voter heat .
