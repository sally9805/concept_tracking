<p> Effort to get federal funds for light rail has n't ended <p> As was recently reported , the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee declined to approve RTD 's initial request for federal funding of the Southwest Corridor Light Rail Transit project . Although we are certainly disappointed by this decision , it does not signal the end of this critical project . The federal budget process is a long and complicated exercise , which is still in its early stages . <p> RTD and several local governments of the Denver region will continue to pursue federal funding for this project . <p> The next step in our pursuit of these funds is the U.S. Senate appropriations process . We have asked Colorado Senators Hank Brown and Ben Nighthorse Campbell to join Rep. Dan Schaefer , RTD and local governments of the Denver region in pursuing federal funding for the Southwest Corridor Light Rail Transit project . The Denver region has the U.S. Senate to apply objective criteria in the awarding of federal rapid transit funds . The application of fair and equitable criteria will demonstrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comparison with other projects being considered , and show that it deserves to receive congressional funding . <p> THOMAS J. BURNS , Mayor <p> Englewood <p> DENNIS S. REYNOLDS , Mayor <p> Littleton <p> Gardens ' neighbors are placated to an extreme <p> On Thursday , July 20 , I attended a concert at the Denver Botanic Gardens . The Gardens were stunning , the music excellent , the employees gracious . <p> The Gardens has some neighbors , however , who are less than gracious . I first discovered this when I saw the unique official " No Parking " signs that threatened towing from in front of some homes on specific Thursdays ( coincidentally the days of concerts ) . These dates were affixed to the signs in such a way that they could be changed , presumably so that each year 's concert schedule could be accommodated . <p> Can a single homeowner restrict taxpayers ' use of a public road to specific dates and times ? Do taxpayers bear the cost of such signs and enforcement ? <p> To placate these neighbors , music inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 55 decibels at the perimeter of the Gardens ( ordinary speech is 65 decibels ) . If the musicians were " too loud , " a red light flashed - which it did when the drummer , playing solo and unamplified , hit one drum ! The audience of 2,000-plus acoustic jazz lovers seldom talked or coughed in order to hear . The concert ended at 9:15 p.m . <p> The neighborhood 's elite likely enjoy their view of the Gardens , but can dictate how much the Gardens are enjoyed by others . There were no noxious weeds in the Botanic Gardens . The same can not be said about the surrounding neighborhood . <p> LISA MORGAN <p> Berthoud <p> Mental illness insurance bill based on falsehoods <p> The July 14 letter by the Colorado Alliance for the Mentally Ill painted an inaccurate picture . <p> The mental illness insurance bill was defeated because it sought unfair advantage for psychiatrists based on falsehoods , not because our legislators are unfair . <p> HB 94-1259 sought to legislate as law what psychiatrists have been unable to prove as fact . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite millions of taxpayers ' dollars being spent on psychiatric research and an avalanche of media claiming a possible biological link has been found , actual proof of this theory does not exist . Few legislators are foolish enough to mandate unproven scientific " fact " as law . <p> Psychiatrists once referred to their patients as " mental defectives . " The term was replaced with the label of " mental illness " which helped gain insurance coverage . Legislation was passed that forced insurance companies to cover these " illnesses , " and the number of psychiatric " illnesses " mushroomed . In the last 15 years , the number of psychiatric " illnesses " listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illness has almost tripled ! This soaring number of " illnesses " and the fact that the DSM does not list a single biological test for one of the psychiatric " illnesses " is further disproof of the biological theory . <p> It would seem that if CAMI really cared for the mentally ill , we would see efforts to gain for patients the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt was damaging - not to provide additional funds for those performing these unwanted treatments . <p> SHERRY YANDA , Registered Nurse <p> Highlands Ranch <p> Picture and caption were n't in agreement <p> C'm on , guys ! Let 's get it right ! <p> You can try to fool our California imports , but please do n't try to snow us natives ! <p> The caption beneath the picture of Longs Peak in the July 21 edition is incorrect . The picture is obviously of the summit , not the Boulder Field . If a simple caption is not right , how can we trust the reporting ? <p> M. BENTLEY HUTCHINSON <p> Denver <p> Workfare wo n't lift people out of poverty <p> A perspective needs to presented other than the one put forward by the Heritage Foundation and parroted by Joan Beck in her July 16 column . Combined spending on Aid to Families with Dependent Children and other programs commonly called " welfare " totaled $ 24.9 billion in 1992 , or 1 percent of the entire federal budget . Compare that to the $ 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not " an eroded work ethic , " as stated by the Heritage Foundation and Beck , that keeps people on welfare . It is an inability to escape poverty when trying to support a family on minimum wages . Despite working , 7 percent of the workforce - 9.2 million persons - stay poor . Almost 60 percent of all poor people live in families where someone works . Workfare proposals will do nothing to lift people out of poverty . By Beck 's own observation , " low cognitive abilities of welfare mothers ( place ) limitations on job training programs . " <p> Training will not be offered under " reform " promoted by the Heritage Foundation . Women forced into workfare will be stuck in subsistence wages . <p> SUE MITROVIC <p> Boulder <p> House is an eyesore , <p> this neighbor declares <p> Douglas Bruce 's house at 24th and Tremont has stood abandoned and derelict for at least four years . <p> The building has been an eyesore and a neighborhood nuisance . Street people have used it to crash . Crackheads have used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a shooting gallery . How do I know ? Because I live two houses away . <p> When the house caught fire in 1994 , it endangered other houses near it . We got out our hoses to wet our roofs in case the flames spread . <p> After the fire , the rafters were charred and cracked . How do I know ? Because I chased adolescents out of there when they were smoking . I was afraid they would blow up themselves and the rest of us . <p> About three months ago , Bruce made a big show of repairing the house . He rented a big orange dumpster and parked it in front of the house . For a few days some workmen put on a roof . Then all work ceased . It did n't start again until the day before his court hearing . <p> Is n't it surprising he suddenly remembered that he has a house on Tremont ? <p> SARAH GRIFFITH <p> Denver <p> Why does Post attack <p> everything Focus does ? <p> James Dobson is a person of his beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of Focus on the Family . His No. 1 best-sellers include " Love Must Be Tough " and " The Strong Willed Child . " These were and are available in all bookstores ; many people have used his practical advice and listen to him on the radio because of his strong family belief . That 's why the title of his program is Focus On The Family . <p> I for one can not understand why The Denver Post continually attacks anything and everything Focus on the Family does . <p> What on earth can be wrong with millions of men getting together to talk and learn about how to be good providers , husbands and fathers ? <p> SUSANN BROWN <p> Hotchkiss <p> Should we rename <p> our kids ' spotted owls ' ? <p> The July 19 issue of The Denver Post contained the following items : the Susan Smith trial , an article about late-term abortions or " partial-birth abortion " as they are now labeled , and a news clip about a newborn baby with umbilical cord still oozing blood being tossed from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper . <p> Maybe we should rename our children " spotted owls " - they certainly would receive better care in our society . <p> PEGGY DIETZ <p> Littleton
