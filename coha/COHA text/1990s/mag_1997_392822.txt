Now , the powers-that-be in Tinseltown know exactly how loyal the fans of that sitcom really are . A major and unprecedented letter-writing , phone-calling and electronic mailing campaign by fans who demanded that Fox TV bring back the sitcom resulted in the popular show returning for its fifth season . Yvette Lee Bowser , the executive producer who also created the show , told JET : " Definitely , we have a tremendous fan base , particularly in African-American households . We were the number-one comedy from the day we premiered . " The show sustained its status with Black audiences all along , never slipping from atop the perch of most-watched shows .

" We were overwhelmed by the fan support . I ca n't say I was surprised by the fact that fans wrote in because we 've always had huge fan support . I received quite a few letters myself . People wrote me saying the characters were positive and inspirational . It 's wonderful that you 're touching people in more ways than just comedically . " Ms. Bowser pointed out that the campaign to save the show was led by Dallas-based radio personality Tom Joyner and BET talk-show host Tavis Smiley . " They really led the way , " she said .

" It was God 's will . The other show was n't ready , and we were . " Even though the network was slow to bring the show back into the fold , Ms. Bowser said Fox is to be commended for ultimately deciding . Before the network made the announcement that " Living Single " would return , she said the cast had already taped four episodes that were ready to air . " The audience will be pleased that we 're back and with the quality of the shows .

Kyle 's character will be a recurring one this season . " We intend to use him as T.C. is available , and we get more orders for episodes , " Ms. Bowser said . " We 'd very much like to have him back on many episodes . " Because the show was added to the lineup so late , she said there will be tremendous pressure to promote the show ( which premiered Sept. 11 at 8:00 p.m . EST ) to make fans aware that they 're back . And , of course , there 's always that pressure to bring in good ratings numbers . " If people are fans already , they 'll love our shows this year , and those who have n't been fans will be pleasantly surprised .
