PICKING THE YEAR 'S BEST IS always an exercise in nostalgia : looking back a few weeks or months and deciding which people and events are worth remembering . But this year the retro spirit took us back much farther than 1995 . Jane Austen and the Beatles were back , and Bruce Springsteen returned to his roots . Discoveries in science ( cave drawings in France ) illuminated man 's earliest days , and the big news in sports was comebacks ( Northwestern ? ) . Even in politics , Colin Powell harked back to an era when presidential candidates could emerge , Ikelike , untainted by the usual rough-and-tumble . Still , the year also had much that was new : Toy Story and Arcadia , Smashing Pumpkins and smashing TV courtroom drama ( some of it real life ) . All that and some nifty Nikes too . So step up , 1995 , and take a bow .
