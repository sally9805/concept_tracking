HE SAYS BOB DOLE HAS GOT " NO ideas . " And Pat Buchanan has got the " wrong " ones . But walking the path of hubris that led Gary Hart off a cliff in 1988 , Lamar Alexander insists he alone has the " new ideas " a new millennium deserves . So goes the sound bite . But Alexander 's signature proposals do n't always live up to their billing . Many have been kicked around for years , dropped as unwise , shirk the tough calls or come with so few details that they raise more questions than they answer . <P> Take Alexander 's biggest idea , captured in his refrain that Americans need to " expect less from Washington and more from ourselves . " While it sounds like an apt theme for the ' 90s , the problem is that Alexander applies it mainly to needy Americans who do n't vote Republican . He has a radical plan to phase out the federal safety net over five years , for example , and pass the buck to local charities . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans , including Medicare and Social Security , untouched . <P> His welfare proposal largely resurrects Ronald Reagan 's controversial ( and unenacted ) " new federalism , " putting $50 billion yearly in food stamps , nutrition programs and Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) under state discretion , while the Federal Government pays state Medicaid costs . To help local charities pick up any slack , Alexander would offer a $500 tax credit for every American to give to the group of their choice . The idea is to rekindle the personal involvement that G.O.P. virtuecrats like William Bennett say made for more " effective compassion " before Uncle Sam got in the way . <P> Is any of this sensible ? There 's little doubt that it 's time to sort out the confusion between federal and state duties . And by " marrying liberal ends with conservative means , " as Urban Institute scholar Isabel Sawhill says a tax credit tries to do , we may be able to " get past our current impasse and find common ground . " The real question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to devolve , as opposed to more dubiously " national " tasks like bridge building and job training . <P> Critics of devolution argue that these safety nets were federalized in the 1960s and ' 70s because states had failed to provide a floor of support for the neediest . Good intentions aside , the political realities in state capitols have n't changed much since . afdc benefit levels , which are set by the states , have fallen on average 47% in real terms since 1970 . There 's reason to fear that these trends would worsen if states had to foot the whole bill . Under today 's system of federal matching grants , for example , Mississippi thinks twice about cutting a dollar from welfare because it then loses up to four dollars from the Federal Government . Without this incentive , experts foresee a benefit-stripping " race to the bottom , " fueled by states ' desire to be stingier than their neighbors to avoid attracting new dependents .                   @ @
