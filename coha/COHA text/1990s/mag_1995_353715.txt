IT 'S THE OLD FAKE-HASID TRICK <P> Sometimes NYPD Blue stars go naked , sometimes they get all dressed up . DENNIS FRANZ went Hasidic for a day last week , but was n't converted . " It was the hottest day of the week , and we chased a guy down the street 15 or 20 times , " says Franz . " I hope I lost a few pounds . " <P> NEXT : BRAD PITT 'S SYMPHONY <P> Apart from the fact that they both have weird things on their chins , actors ETHAN HAWKE and Kirk Douglas have little in common . But the similarities doubled when Little , Brown announced that it had bought the first literary work by the thinking teenager 's sex symbol ( Douglas is the proud author of three novels ) . Hawke 's book , The Hottest State , is described by its editor , Jordan Pavlin , as being " about first love and heartbreak , about being turned inside out by the intensity of your own emotion . " Little , Brown paid about $300,000 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first novels about first love and heartbreak . Hawke 's will hit bookstores in fall 1996 , but nobody is saying whether the price reflects the quality of the material or the number of girls who will buy it regardless . <P> SEEN &; HEARD <P> The world 's richest man , Bill Gates , and the world 's luckiest hooker , Divine Brown , are both doing commercials for Brazilian TV . Brown , who was " discovered " while working in a white BMW , is promoting Valisere lingerie . " If you do n't want your man looking for someone else , " she says in the ad , " If I were you , I would use Valisere . " Gates is shilling for Unibanco 's online personal-banking services . " Wish my bank had thought of that , " he says . Only one of them is doing it for the money . <P> WHICH PERSUASION ? <P> Was JANE AUSTEN gay ? This question , posed by the normally staid London Review of Books , was the headline for an essay by Stanford professor Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Austen 's letters to her sister Cassandra . The implication has caused quite a kerfuffle among Austenites . " I think it 's about as likely that Jane Austen was gay as that she was found out to be a man , " was one of the more temperate responses . Says Castle , miffed : " For the readers of the LRB , I did n't really expect this to be such a stunning revelation . "
