Travis Lee , the Diamondbacks ' slugging first baseman , was sitting in the dugout at Bank One Ballpark , a.k.a. the BOB , recently , going through the highlights of a season that could end with his being named National League Rookie of the Year . " So far , " said Lee , " I can walk the dog , I can hop the fence , I can trapeze , I can rock the baby , rock the baby cha-cha-cha , orbit launch and rocket launch . " He took a deep breath . " Plus , I can go around the world about 10 times . " // Through Aug. 29 , Lee also had 20 homers and 59 RBIs and was perhaps the most popular Phoenix attraction this side of the pool in the BOB . But big numbers and wide popularity bring nothing more than a polite nod and a shrug of Lee 's sizable shoulders . To get a rise out of him , start talking yo-yo . // Earlier this season , a little bored from too much free time between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a yo-yo he had seen Drew Benes , Arizona righthander Andy Benes 's nine-year-old son , playing with in the clubhouse . Within days Lee had purchased his second yoyo , a Fireball . Then he bought another Fireball . Then a classic wooden Duncan . Then a Stinger , which has two real dead scorpions embedded in its clear sides . When the Diamondbacks visited San Francisco in July , he went to Fisherman 's Wharf and paid $3 for a yo-yo that lights up . " I was excited , " he says . Two weeks later , it broke . " You get what you pay for . " // Lee , a quiet sort , refuses to call his sudden yo-yo affinity an addiction . More of a diversion , he says . Of late , that has n't been such a bad thing . Since returning three weeks ago from a 15-day stint on the disabled list to heal a groin strain , Lee , a 23-year-old from Olympia , Wash. , had played more like Travis Tritt than a guy selected No. 2 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Saturday . " It 's one of the most frustrating things I 've ever gone through , " he said last week . " I 'm completely healthy , and I feel like I 'm swinging the bat well . But for some reason , I ca n't hit the ball . " // Until recently Lee , Rockies first baseman Todd Helton ( .318 , 21 homers , 85 RBIs ) and Cubs righthander Kerry Wood ( 12-6 , 3.36 ERA , 223 strikeouts ) were neck , neck and neck in the rookie of the year race . However , if Lee 's average dips much further ( in a span of 16 games , it fell from .288 to .265 ) , he could fall behind even Montreal first baseman Brad Fullmer ( .286 , 40 doubles , 62 RBIs ) . " You ca n't perform like I have lately and win many awards , " Lee says . // Not true . Lee is a shoo-in for Diamondback with Most Marriage Requests . Fans love him . Women scream his name . Kids-including his teammates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have happened had Lee and his agent , Jeff Moorad , not taken advantage of the system . Two years ago , when he was selected out of San Diego State by the Twins , Lee  --  along with three other draftees-benefited from an obscure rule that makes first-round picks free agents if they are not tendered contract offers within 15 days of being drafted . After Minnesota failed to meet the deadline , the expansion Diamondbacks , still a year and a half from playing their first game , snared him with a $10 million signing bonus . // With millions in the bank , Lee can afford the good stuff . " There 's this one model , " he says , drooling just a bit . " It 's called the Silver Bullet , and it 's about $90 . That 's a lot of money for a yo-yo , but I think I have to buy it . "
