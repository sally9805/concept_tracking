KIT lies on a deck chair by a pool under bright white sunlight . She is wearing a string bikini and very dark glasses . She is wired to a Walkman . On a table beside her is a large container of yogurt and a large pitcher of orange juice . The whole place smells of suntan lotion . There is a chain link fence , upstage , protecting the pool . It is covered by vines and foliage . From behind this fence , we hear the click of a camera shutter . Then another . Then another . Camera shutters continue under . Camera flashes and shutters also from the house behind the audience . KIT addresses these cameras . KIT I hear you . You think I ca n't hear you ? You and your cameras . You 're not the only one who has a camera . She takes a camcorder off a tripod . She aims it at the photographers  --  and the audience . KIT Do you like it ? Getting your picture taken ?

Sandy 's pool . And the photographers are back . Even though Sandy is in court , of course , which they must know .

Guys will always be preliminary to my work with battered women SHEILA , a young black woman , appears from the house with a wheeled cart . The cart holds a TV set , trailing wires , and extension cords . SHEILA is full of energy and dressed rather wonderfully . SHEILA Okay ! I 'm back .

KIT Until the trial 's over , right ? Until they get to pull the switch on her . SHEILA That 's not going to happen . KIT I know that . SHEILA Because you do n't pull switches , do you ?

CANDIDA ( on screen ) Today we are talking to " Mothers Whose Sons are Gay Bar Strippers . " KIT Right on . SHEILA This is not Sir Isaiah Berlin . KIT No , do n't change it . TROY , a clean-cut gay bar-stripper , in a sports jacket and a button-down shirt , gets up to do a bump and grind . The audience applauds , hoots , and whistles , led by TROY 'S MOM . TROY 'S MOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Go , Troy ! p. 7 SHEILA This is a rerun . KIT I know . SHEILA This is a Sweeps Week thing . KIT Is that Troy 's mom ? Really ? SHEILA This needs a context .

They 're both good on TV , whatever that means . Isaiah Berlin , historian , philosopher . And Troy , the Sweeps Week thing . In the Berlin interview , we talked about his essay  --  you know , his essay on Archilochus. . . no , you probably do n't . . . . " The Hedgehog and the Fox . " Because Archilochus wrote " The fox knows many things , but the hedgehog knows one big thing . " And Sir Isaiah asked us to try to go beyond the literal meaning of those words . Beyond the image of the hedgehog in a spiky ball , the fox defeated . Because he thought , taken figuratively , the words might expose one of the deepest differences between writers , between thinkers , between all of us . The fox knows many things , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What does that mean ? I do n't know , but I cried when I heard Isaiah Berlin was dead . Not because of my award  --  it was only an ACE award , I mean you get them for breathing , and they look like hockey pucks . And not because he had died . Not exactly . Because he was eighty-eight , which is not a sad time to die , exactly . But I cried . I probably wo n't even hear when Troy dies . He may be dead already , and nobody knows , unless he 's from a very tiny town and his very tiny hometown paper printed his obit : " Dancer Dies . Appeared on Candida Grey Show . " Fame . It 's strange , is n't it ? ( SHEILA notices KIT might be dead ) Hello ? Earth calling Kit ? ( pause ) You are n't listening , right ? Are you still alive ? No response from KIT .

And Tommy 's on your case . " So , girls , is Sheila working out ? " " So girls , are you getting along ? " SHEILA I 've known Tommy since high school . KIT " So girls , what 's the girl talk ?

With Candida . KIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Sandy said that you were simpatico . And he was n't simpatico . She does n't like him . I mean , I 'm sorry , I guess , since you 're " working together . " SHEILA You do n't think we 're working together ? KIT I mean , I like him . I think he 's cute , but Sandy does n't like him , so she plays this trick on him , okay ? So she tells him that you told us that we had to sign some papers . . . . p. 12 SHEILA Our releases ? KIT So he gets all excited , so he 's fumbling for his briefcase , so he brings out all these papers , and Sandy pretends it 's too dark to read them , and he says that 's okay , he 'll explain , and he explains : " This release is for Candida . This release is for your documentary . " So , Sandy says , well , he did n't explain as well as you did , but she 'll sign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ releases ? KIT So , then she pretends she 's little looped , and she spills the sangria all over the table . . . . SHEILA But . She signed .

" That 's what he told her . p. 13 SHEILA Tommy takes his work seriously . KIT But that 's disgusting , right ? So that 's why Sandy does n't like him . So that 's why she told him how she liked you . SHEILA Let me put this in context for you , Kit  --  KIT No , really , you came up here , and your brought your briefcase out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little looped . . . .

SHEILA I 'm much more serious , in fact . KIT That 's not what Tommy thinks . SHEILA It 's what he knows . Because his last three shows were based on my proposals . KIT No , Sheila .

Tommy says that you 're a sweetheart . SHEILA No . KIT You care . And you let people know that you care . p. 14 SHEILA Tommy does n't think that I 'm a sweetheart . KIT But he said he was here now .

SHEILA She understood your dreams , Kit . . . ? p. 46 KIT What ? SHEILA She understood your dreams . Why was that ? KIT Because she 's the one I told . . . about my father . SHEILA About . . . your father . . . . Is she almost afraid of what she knows is coming next ? KIT And she understood because she said , you know , it had happened to her , her father was the same , you know . . . . SHEILA The same . A hint that SHEILA thinks she 's being conned ? KIT And we made a vow , you know , that our fathers would suffer , and for a long time after that , we would check these stupid kidstuff witch books out of the library and do spells on them , our fathers , late at night . We 'd burn our hair , and curse them so their dicks would rot . Which may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off me then . But I do n't think that was the reason . I think my dad turned off me because I was , you know , twelve , and I started my period . I think he hates women . ( to SHEILA ) I think some guys hate women , do n't you ? SHEILA Is this true , Kit ? KIT Sometimes I think , some guys , they hate women , is that true ? p. 47 SHEILA Oh , Kit . . . . KIT ( blithely ) The other thing that happened when we were twelve , we had this teacher for sex education , Ms. Henderson , and she was always hugging us , and telling us about good touching and bad touching , and telling us to tell , you know , about touching . I liked Ms. Henderson . No , I really liked her . So did Sandy . That 's why Sandy told . She told Ms H. about the stuff her father did to her , and she told me about how good it was to tell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to , because my dad was off me , it was over . I just wanted to forget it , but Sandy said remember that we had vowed to make them suffer , and what if my dad turned into some sex maniac , violating other women . Which I did n't think my dad would do , as it happens , because I thought it was me . I thought my dad could n't help it . I thought it was me . SHEILA Oh , Kit . . . it was n't . . . . KIT But Sandy says " Please , Kit . . . . What about your sister ? " We both had little sisters . So I told . But the weird thing was . . . it did n't feel good telling . Because Ms H. kept saying " Is that what really happened , Kit ? " " Tell me what really happened . Tell me exactly what happened . " And I thought , what 's to tell , eh ? Except your father tells you you 're his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you make him feel , and he touches you , and you know it is definitely bad , even when it feels good , and then he says you can make him feel even better , and he puts his thing in your . . . . He puts his fucking thing in your . . . . I mean , how many ways do you have to say it , but Ms H. keeps looking at me without blinking , which makes her look a little scary . She looks like an android , and she keeps saying " Tell me what really happened , Kit . Exactly what happened . " She did n't believe me . She said " Is that true , Kit ? " And I say " He says You 're my princess . You 're my Princess Roxie " . . . which makes me feel sick just to think about it . And Ms. Henderson looks sick . She looks bug-eyed . What disease is that ? When your eyeballs are paralyzed ? p. 48 SHEILA Kit , you do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is getting counselling . And every week she gets to get off school , and she and her mom get to go to T.O . and talk to this guy . Sandy says that he looks like Willem Dafoe . And I just keep talking to Ms. Bug-Eyed Henderson . . . . And I can tell , she does n't like me . I can tell . She thinks I 'm weird . A very long pause . Long enough so SHEILA turns away and begins to pack up , both disappointed and relieved that it seems to be over . SHEILA That 's good , okay ? No , really , Kit , you did real good . KIT I talked to Henderson till Christmas . SHEILA goes back to the camera . KIT Because after Christmas , she is n't there , and we hear she 's a wing nut , and I ca n't believe that bug-eyed shit was something serious . Then Sandy tells me what she told Ms H. She told Ms H. my life . She said she was Princess Roxie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She says she had to tell my story . She says she could n't tell her story . She said " If you knew what my dad did to me , you 'd understand why I ca n't talk about it . " That 's what she said . That 's what she told me . And I believed her . SHEILA Why , Kit ? p. 49 KIT So you see . I gave her something . Which I like to remember , sometimes , because most times , with Sandy , it was what she gave me , most times , for sure . SHEILA Why is Sandy your friend ? KIT I 've worn her clothes . I 've worn her underwear . . . . SHEILA Kit ? KIT We were fourteen , eh ? And she had this idea we 'd trade brains . For a week , we 'd be each other . We 'd wear each other 's clothes for a whole week , we 'd trade lunches in the cafeteria , and Walkman tapes , and she 'd quite smoking , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to be the other person . She got all our friends to call her " Kit . " They called me " Sandy . " It was wicked . If someone said " Sandy , " I 'd have to answer . If someone said " Kit , " I 'd have to say , like , " Why are you calling me Kit , because I 'm Sandy . " Because she did my hair like hers , and I did hers like mine , and we did each other 's make-up just like we were looking in a mirror . It was better than a mirror . I was looking in a mirror . Seeing Sandy . Being Sandy . . . . Sandy . She is so beautiful . And she knows it . And she does n't care . She would do my eyeliner , I mean , she would do her eyeliner on my eyes , and she 'd say " Sandy , wow , you 're gorgeous ! " And she 'd kiss me . Pause . SHEILA sees new revelations . She prods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . . . . KIT And we handed in each other 's homework , eh ? All week . SHEILA And she 'd kiss you , Kit . . . . KIT But the teachers did n't get it . They thought we were trying to scam something . They did n't see . . . . They did n't see the possibilities . It was an experiment . A psychological experiment . Like the stuff we were studying . Like 1837 . Like Greenpeace . ( she laughs ) So we made detention three times that week , easy , but we did n't care . We could n't stop laughing . It was wicked . Then we wrote in each other 's diaries . First we read each other 's diaries . And Sandy 's diary was all what she wanted this guy , Brad , to do to her , and mine was not . My diary was about my body , mostly . About how I hate my body . Sometimes how I hate my mother . And my father . But mostly my body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks blank ) Kit ? You hate your body . . . . KIT Do you just want to talk about sex ? SHEILA Did I say . . . ? KIT Sandy 's tongue in my mouth ? My dad 's dick ? p. 51 SHEILA I did n't say . . . . KIT This is " Kit 's Video Diary . Chapter 1312 . " Can I say what happened ? What really happened ? Can I say something real ? SHEILA You can say what you want . Now SHEILA concentrates on getting good videotape . KIT So Sandy and I traded brains . And every night for the whole week , Sandy would take my diary and write about how she hated how she looked , how she hated her parents , and I 'd write about Brad trying to undo my bra . Then we 'd read what we wrote to each other , and scream laughing . It was wicked . It was so wicked . So we 'd waltz into the cafeteria every day at lunch . We used to eat with Brad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this week , Monday , Sandy just sat down with Ken , and I sat with Brad , and we did n't say anything , we just were each other . I felt kind of sorry for Ken , because he 's kind of scared of Sandy , but she sits down beside him , and she 's doing my stuff that I liked to do with him . I liked to touch him . I like to touch , I do n't like getting touched , he understood that  --  you understand that , do n't you ? SHEILA Keep going , Kit . . . . KIT He wore this earring , one earring ? I liked to play with it . Sandy 's playing with his earring , and I am telling Brad what a dork he is , which is what Sandy does . She rakes him over . I say " Got another hard-on , Brad . " And I look at his crotch , which is what Sandy would do . And the weird thing is , there 's this bulge in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't know what 's going on , and when they figure out what 's going on , they 're still going crazy . Because I am being Sandy and she 's me , and we 're talking about double-dating Friday night , and the guys are wondering , how far is this going to go ? You can see that they see it 's an experiment . And Brad Sandy and I are laughing . We do n't even have to talk about it . We just know we 're going to do it . Friday . KIT begins to move . SHEILA follows her with the camera . KIT So I 'm in the front seat with Brad , and he reaches for me and he calls me Sandy , and it 's like nothing bad has ever happened . I am Sandy . I am floating and nothing can happen , except I 'll get exactly what I want . Exactly what I wrote about . Brad will kiss me wherever I want him to . And then he 'll jerk himself off , like in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking . But the next thing I know , Ken is swearing at Sandy , and they 're punching each other around in the back seat . And he 's saying , you f-word , you c-word , he 's saying " Damn you , bitch . Screw you . " And he says that Sandy 's making fun of me . And he says it 's not funny . And he 's crying . He 's actually crying . And he 's trying to get out of the car , which makes everything turn into some stupid cartoon , because it 's a two-door , and we 're all clowns piling out of this car . And Sandy 's saying " Oh , Ken , puhleeze . . . . " And I 'm saying " Please , Ken . . . . " And Brad is trying to pull his zipper up and say " Be cool , man , " all at the same time , and Ken just splits . He takes off . And Sandy says " Let him go . " Her eyes were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop crying . And she hugged me . And she kissed my hair . She said " Sandy , you 're crying . " She said " Sandy , do n't please . . . I 'm the one who cries . " I could n't stop crying . . . . p. 53 SHEILA Kit . . . . SHEILA puts down the camera . She hugs KIT . KIT breaks away . KIT So Sandy says " Fuck it . You go find him , then . " So I went . So the first thing that happened , I slipped in the mud , in the creek , I went down to the creek . . . . And the second thing that happened was I found him . . . . He was under the bridge . And someone had left a can of spray paint there , and he was trying to write " Anarchy , " he was screaming " Anarchy ! " And I reached for his hand , and he hit me , by accident , he did n't mean to hit me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said " God , I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . " And I kissed him until he kissed me back , and it was wonderful . His tongue in my mouth . I was floating . I wanted him . And that would n't have happened , except for Sandy . Where 's the camera ? SHEILA has put the camera down . She looks around for it . SHEILA What ? KIT Do n't you want this on tape ? SHEILA Kit . . . ? Are you okay ? KIT I want this on tape . I want this on TV , so come on , Sheila . . . . KIT sets herself up in front of the camera . KIT If it were n't for Sandy , I 'd still be eating Mr. Big bars , and throwing up , and kissing people with my mouth closed . I want to say this on TV . Because she is n't guilty . Even if she says she 's guilty . . . . p. 54 SHEILA Are you sure she is n't guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that when we were kids , of course . . . . That was before she met Bobby . . . . Very distant sound of thunder . SHEILA Forget Bobby . . . . KIT Was that thunder ? SHEILA You and Sandy , Kit . . . . KIT That 's weird , eh ? There 's thunder and the sun 's still out . SHEILA Because no one cares about Bobby . Bobby 's history . He 's toast . Bobby 's in jail , and Sandy 's made a deal to keep him there . KIT You probably think I 'm going to say it 's all his fault . But . . . I mean , I know him and I do n't like him . . . I mean , he wants to be a singer , a rap singer , but he 's pitiful . Thunder . KIT ( she raps ) Just another white boy trying to be bad Just another white boy trying to be bad . . . . Thunder . KIT looks up at the sky . KIT I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up . . . . p. 55 SHEILA Yes . I know he kept beating her up . KIT It 's going to rain . That 's weird , eh ? SHEILA Let 's remember , Kit . Bobby is toast .

He 's the bad guy . . . . You and Sandy . . . . KIT I say " I 've never played strip poker , " and then if I have played strip poker , then I have to drink . And so do you . She drinks . She looks up at SHEILA . KIT You never played strip poker ? SHEILA No . KIT Have you got one ? I 've got another one . I never beat the tax on cigarettes . ( she drinks ) I 've never done cocaine .

That 's why I know . She did n't do it . SHEILA What have you done , Kit ? KIT The true story is that she said that she did it . SHEILA What have you done , Kit ? KIT The true story is . . . . Crack of lightning . Blackout . @x We are in a well-appointed rec room with a wet-bar , a TV , a VCR , and a huge library of video tapes . The rec room is in the basement . There are stairs leading to the first floor . Pot lights over the wet-bar illuminate a vodka bottle , KIT 's glass , and her yogurt . A TV screen is lit , facing upstage . These are the only lights in the room , except for the light over the space where a picture once hung . This picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty , blond , young girl , leans against the wall underneath the light . There is a light from offstage , where a clothes dryer is running . There 's another door , which leads to a bathroom . Unlit . The whole place smells , not unpleasantly , of fabric softener . The stage is empty . SHEILA enters down the stairs . She is carrying too much stuff , the stuff from the deck in Act One . Her briefcase , the camcorder , the tripod , a microphone . Whatever she is n't carrying is already in the room . Her progress down the stairs is awkward . She is wet and grumpy . SHEILA Let 's get all this stuff in out of the rain , you say . And I take the TV , and the VCR , and the camcorder , and the tripod , and the answering machine , and your Walkman , and your tapes , and your sunglasses , and your tie-dyed silk robe . I am lugging your stuff around ? Why ? ( she mimics KIT ) " Sheila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black thing ? " No , Kit , it 's an adult thing . It 's a responsible thing , it 's the way the world works . You clean up your messes . You bring things inside from the rain . What did you bring in ? Your highball glass . Straight to the bar . She dips a finger in KIT 's glass and licks it . p. 60 SHEILA The suburban living room . St. Catharines , 1997 , but it looks like 1950 . There is vodka straight up on the bar . There 's the black velvet painting of Skippy . SHEILA does not want to meet SKIPPY 's eyes . SHEILA But there 's videotape of course . All this videotape . And this letter , framed above the bar . It 's from America 's Funniest Home Videos , I see , and it says " Thank you for your interest . " Right . She might set up her camera so she 's ready to tape . SHEILA Be careful of your videographer , Kit . Because remember what Chomsky says . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sell entertainment . TV sells customers . Try to remember that .

SHEILA You know when I knew that I wanted this story ? I did the research . I saw you on some stupid " News at Seven . " You were protecting Sandy . You were shielding Sandy from some camera . You were crying , Kit . . . . KIT You think it 's hard to cry ? p. 90 SHEILA Kit ? Are you crying ? KIT You want me to tell you what happened ? Everything that happened ? Okay . Why not ? I 'll just look straight at the camera , and I 'll tell you . SHEILA Give me the gun first . KIT No , I think the gun is good . If I 'm waving the gun around . If no one knows what I 'm going to do . Sheila , it 's so lawless . Look , should n't you be taping me ? SHEILA No . I do n't think so . KIT But you 're a journalist , are n't you ? A videographer . SHEILA Yes . I am . But  --  KIT Say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bosnia . SHEILA But would you have that gun , Kit ? If I did n't have this camera ? KIT Sheila ? What ? SHEILA If you try to record the existence of sup-atomic particles , it changes their behavior . Did you know that ? She aims the camera at KIT . KIT is uncomfortable . She puts down the gun . KIT You know what you want when you try something ? Something lawless ? Something wild ? You want more . That 's weird , right ? More . It 's because you get used to it . Because it is n't lawless if you 're doing it . Because everything you do , you make excuses for . I mean , you know that , do n't you ? You do this show , this great show , like " Mothers Whose Sons are Gay Bar Strippers " . . . . I loved that show , that show was fun , but when it 's over , what do you do next ? Sheila ? Then what do you do ? p. 91 SHEILA I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea . Sheila ? Do you want to hear it ? SHEILA No . I do n't . No . KIT " Mothers Whose Sons Are Gay Bar Stripper Killers . " It could be awesome . It could be a Sweeps Week thing . Because there 's Troy , and maybe he saw this " Gay Bar Stripper " on TV and , you know , he got aroused , you know , and , you know , he could n't deal with it , and so , he made up all these canisters of nerve gas . . . . SHEILA Kit . . . no more . . . . KIT Too gross , right ? And not true ? And it has to be true . So you know what could happen ? At the end ? It would be like TV . It would all be a dream . Like the tape of Skippy dying . . . . SHEILA Skippy dying ? She looks at the tape again . KIT I hate this tape . SHEILA You think Skippy is dying ? On that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KIT Whoops . I hit erase . SHEILA Kit . . . . KIT No , it 's okay , Sheila . You do n't want to see it . You do n't want it to have happened . You want to start over , do n't you ? With blank tape . Want to make our own tape ? " Kit and Sheila 's Video Diary . . . . " p. 92 SHEILA Kit , please . . . . KIT " Bimbettes in Canada . " Scene one . Warning . Gunshots . She shoots out the light over SKIPPY 's picture . She laughs . KIT Gunshots . Partial nudity . Strong language and gross jokes about men , right , Sheila ? SHEILA Give me the gun , Kit . . . . KIT Want to play that back ? SHEILA I want you to give me the gun . KIT replays a videotape of furniture , which includes an offscreen gunshot . KIT This camera was n't framed right , was it ? SHEILA The gun , Kit . . . . KIT Or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KIT pops videotapes in all available monitors , and they all display white noise . KIT You want to see what happened ?
