For 11-year-old Carolyn Cross of Palo Alto , Calif. , shopping online is way cooler than your average trip to the mall , and for one very important reason : " You do n't have to get your parents to drive you , which they , like , never do , " she says . Carolyn 's dad Peter might beg to differ about that , but he does agree that letting Carolyn make purchases at RocketCash , an e-commerce site designed for teens , makes things easier on the family . " Carolyn gets to feel in control , but I feel good ' cause her shopping is limited to certain stores and certain amounts , " Cross says . <P> It 's probably only a matter of time before the generation that is pointing and clicking its way into young adulthood abandons the mall for the mouse . With the launch of three websites this year , and some recent legislation that should put parents more at ease , kids can now shop online just like Mom and Dad . <P> The three new sites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
