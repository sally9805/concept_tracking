My favorite riot , funny until it turned fatal , occurred at New York City 's Astor Place Theater in May 1849 , when factions supporting two rival Shakespearean actors  --  William Macready , the mincing traditionalist from England , and Edwin Forrest , the obstreperous , furniture-chewing American  --  became so violent at Macready 's performance of Macbeth that the militia was summoned . The militia opened fire , and 22 boisterous theater lovers died . <P> There are reasons , good or bad , to have a riot : to protest police brutality ; to celebrate winning the World Series . Harvard students once rioted because the university started issuing diplomas in English instead of Latin . <P> But a riot needs no reason at all . It was hard to put one 's finger on what exactly touched off the messy end last week of Woodstock ' 99 , the three-day rock festival held in sweltering heat on an inhospitable decommissioned Air Force base in upstate New York . The overflowing Port-o-Sans that no one bothered to empty ? The formidable mounds of garbage that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle of water , $7.50 for a chicken sandwich ? In retrospect , it seems odd that rock fans would travel halfway across the country and pay $150 a ticket to be treated worse than illegal Cuban refugees . <P> On the other hand , what happened at Woodstock ' 99 ( arson , pillaging , freelance mayhem ) was much in the spirit of the music and of the occasion itself , which , for all the tie-dyed shirts , peace signs , long hair and dope , was only a venal shadow of an irrecoverable ghost . <P> A tamer glimpse of popular culture now : thrashing in the mosh pit in front of the stage , from which security people would occasionally rescue a naked girl , her clothes ripped away by enthusiasts as she incautiously body-surfed the pit . From the stage , Fred Durst , singer for the aggressively untalented rap-metal band Limp Bizkit , made it explicit : he instructed the audience to " start some s . " Which some of the audience obediently did , scaling the sound tower and ripping away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( not just the disorderly ones ) seems to have judged that the organizers violated an unwritten social contract . Things came to a head on the final night ; the crowds made bonfires of accumulated trash heaps and danced around the flames  --  a Dionysian image for the cameras . Rioters , admittedly a small minority of the crowd of more than 200,000 , attacked concession stands and threw tables and chairs onto the flames . The more ambitious attacked an ATM . Someone burned a Mercedes near the stage ; others set fire to 12 tractor-trailer trucks ; propane tanks fired off gaudily . <P> Savagery and innocence commingled oddly . The spectacle had tabloids the next day writing about Woodstock ' 99 as if it were a sort of sock hop for the Children of the Corn . And that , mind you , was before the papers learned about the rapes.
