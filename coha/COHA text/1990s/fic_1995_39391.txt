" You know how long it took me to use a knife again ? " The mother held up her empty hand , as if it could testify on its own . " I could n't slice a tomato , carve meat , anything . I 'd shove it away from me . " <p> The reporter 's hand held a pen . He had a notebook as well as a cassette recorder , and every so often he wrote something down . " What are you writing ? " the mother asked . " What did I say ? " The reporter showed her . He 'd written the word " knife . " That was all . It was a note to himself , he explained . <p> " It 's always in the back of your mind , " said the mother . " It comes out in ways you do n't expect . Like if I see a TV commercial with a little girl in it , it do n't even have to look like her . It still sets me off Is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Hughes said yes , this was fine . He said she should talk about anything she felt like . <p> The mother said , " I am only doing this because it might help jog somebody 's memory . Or whoever 's out there , it might make them come forward . " <p> The mother sat on the living-room couch , which was covered with a tasseled bedspread . The mother 's name was Bonita Poole . Hughes knew from his notebook that she was forty-four years old , divorced , and worked in a factory which made packaging materials . Next to the mother on the couch sat her oldest daughter , Joy . On top of the television set was a picture of the daughter who had died , and an arrangement of dried roses . The roses came from the funeral , the mother said . They were pink roses , faded to the color of old paper except at their tips , shedding petals when nobody was looking . <p> In the photograph the daughter had a waterfall of poufy hair arranged over one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her mouth . A wise-guy smirk , as if she 'd mugged and giggled and stared the camera down , not really wanting to have her picture taken . Her name was Kelly Poole and she was eighteen when she died , one year ago minus ten days . <p> The mother saw Hughes looking at the picture . " Pretty , ai n't she . Those big brown eyes . She favored her Dad that way . " <p> Mrs. Poole and Joy were stamped out of a different mold , fair , with sketched-in eyebrows , and faces as broad and plain as pie tins . Joy was twenty-seven . She looked like she 'd stopped being young some time back , almost with relief . Young had probably never suited her . She was hard around the mouth and soft everywhere else . Flesh mounded up under her T-shirt and stretch pants . Just by sitting , she projected grievance , the unfairness of being large and unpretty and having a sister who 'd been raped and murdered and pushed into a ditch off a county road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's hair , absently , as if it were her own head . <p> Hughes thought , as he often did in the homes of the poor , of expensive magazines , department stores , and banks , everything that implied this room did not exist . But here it was in all its gaping ugliness , turning the lie around ; it was as if nothing else was real except for it . The living room walls were painted a deep flat unconvincing blue . Water stains dripped down from the corners . Plastic curtains hung at the cloudy windows . The kitchen was at the other end of the main room . Boxes of cereal and crackers were lined up on the counter , along with scouring powder and a jar of iced-tea mix . The refrigerator muttered , laboring . <p> Two ceramic plaques in the shape of preening roosters hung over the kitchen table . The smell in the house was of something burnt , with an overlay of cheese . <p> " Tell him about the phone calls , " Joy said . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the mother shook her head . <p> " That stuff do n't have nothing to do with Kelly . It 's just ugly . " <p> " People are sick , " said Joy . " We got calls right after the funeral . People hanging up on you . Or saying things . " <p> " That 's enough , " said the mother . " Like I said . " Joy sat back on the couch , her mouth closing down over another grievance . <p> " Tell me about the psychic , " suggested Hughes . The psychic had told the police where to find the body . The psychic was one of the things that made the case newsworthy . <p> " Oh , him . We kind of gave up on him . " <p> " He moved to Cincinnati , " said Joy . " He was regular-looking . He could of been somebody 's grandfather . " Her tone implied that this was one of his failings . <p> " They give him a sweater of hers . Like a bloodhound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit . " The mother closed her eyes . Hughes had seen the police pictures of the body . He hoped the mother had not . <p> When she looked up again she said , " He ca n't help us with who did it . It 's like the trail 's gone cold . Like he ca n't find her spirit . Do you think people get more dead as time goes on ? " <p> Hughes said he did n't know . He was unsure of what the mother wanted him to say , and unsure of the whole notion . Yes , he might have said , if he 'd thought about it . The dead become more dead . They recede from us little by little , down a long corridor . They forget their names before we do . <p> But the mother did n't want an answer . She said , " He give me all these numbers that were supposed to be license plates of cars . For a while that 's all I did , was drive around looking for those numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . One day I looked at them and said , What is this ? It was getting out of hand . Sometimes I sit and try and make my mind clear , to see if something comes to me . You 'd think if anybody would feel something , it 'd be me . " <p> In his notebook , Hughes saw he had written the word " psychic , " followed by a question mark . <p> " Her father lives in Florida . I had the police call him . We have n't seen him since nineteen seven nine . He did n't come to the funeral . He never kept up with her or his other , that 's Pete . It 's like he never had a daughter . It 's like a car he sold a long time ago , then somebody else wrecked it . " <p> Photographs of the mother 's six surviving children stair-stepped their way across the living-room wall . Some were towheaded and jowly , like Joy , others darker , more angular . Distinctive features  --  a receding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a schematic representation of the marriages , three of them . Someone else might have asked , reasonably , why Mrs. Poole kept on marrying , kept having children , but Hughes thought it was because Mrs. Poole took life seriously . Hughes liked Mrs. Poole , which was different than feeling sorry for her . <p> " Do you want an orange soda ? " she asked . " I run on so much , I did n't think to offer anything . " <p> Hughes said thank you , but not to bother . He closed his notebook . <p> His hand rested on the cassette recorder , waiting and delicate . <p> " I almost forgot you had that going , " said the mother . " Did you get enough for your story ? There 's a lot more about Kelly , but I do n't know if it would be good in a story . She liked baking cakes , fancy ones , with the decorations . She loved kids , she was great with them .

I know that do n't make sense . It 's the exact same jacket you can get at the mall . " <p> Hughes made his thank-yous . He eased out the front door and stood looking at the square of lawn , the clumped brown grass that had already stopped growing . It was the end of September , a bright dry season , when everything in the landscape bleached out . The sun had a squint to it , flattening the shadows . White weeds lined the ditches . Leaves faded and curled under . A dry wind made these leaves click together , and spun the petals of a plastic sunflower stuck at the edge of the lot . A clothesline hung along one side of the porch , freighted with white cotton socks , striped bath towels , T-shirts , stretched-out underpants . The cloth made stiff ridges around the clothespins , as if everything had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him of something . He decided it was the petrified flowers inside . On the street the car he 'd come in was parked , a heavy , shining car that made the small frame houses look stoop-shouldered , flimsy and wrong . He could see the photographer sitting behind the steering wheel , his head back , dozing . <p> The front door opened again and Joy came out . Hughes could n't tell if she 'd wanted to find him , or if it was an accident , his standing there a minute too long . She did n't seem startled at encountering him . She said , " So what are you going to say about us ? " <p> " It depends on how much space the editor gives me . " This was true , although it did n't answer her question . <p> " Uh huh , " said Joy . She folded her arms over her chest . The cool wind roughened her skin , bringing up pebbly goose bumps . " She was my half-sister , " she said . " Kelly was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said managed to convey deep suspicion , belligerent disbelief . <p> " You mentioned phone calls . " <p> " I was n't always the one to answer . The times I answered it was some guy . He 'd say , ' Hey , I did her too , and she was good . ' Talk like that . And a lot worse . That 's what my mother had to listen to . " " I 'm sorry , " said Hughes . There was a place in his mind where he sealed away the knowledge of such things . <p> Joy kept talking . It was as if only certain words fit the shape of her mouth , words she had not been allowed to say inside . " She grew up flighty because she was spoiled . She had to have everything : clothes , a car . She got in trouble once , she was going to have a baby . Mom had to pay for that too . She used to walk around the house without her clothes on , just to show off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't care how that sounds . She knew too many boys and they were all supposed to pay attention to her . But she was my own family . I knew her all her life , beginning to end . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " Hughes said again . He wanted to leave now , to get away from this world of women and their dense , intricate griefs . He looked out past the crimped grass and the gleaming ovals of light reflected in the surface of his car , to the end of the block where the road broadened out into Main Street . <p> " If they found out who did it , I would do anything . I would cut off parts of him . " <p> Hughes did n't respond . Joy said , " You live in Chicago , do n't you ? " <p> " The suburbs , " amended Hughes , then wondered what possible difference it would make to her . <p> " You would n't come to a place like this in a million years except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like she had to be so pretty . <p> Well , she 's dead now because she was pretty and somebody wanted to get her . And you 're only interested in her because she 's dead . " <p> Hughes had never wanted to kill anyone . He considered himself deficient in hatred , or perhaps murder came from something different , something cooler to the touch . He had not wished to kill , even in his imagination , his ex-wife in the last ruinous weeks of their marriage , nor drunks who had stood toe to toe with him in parking lots , nor any of his professional enemies , men who had lied or undercut him . No treacherous friend , no figures of fairy-tale malice from his childhood . ( Hughes had grown up in a place called Licking , Missouri , and he would n't have gone back there in a million years . ) He was as incapable of the thought of murder as of the deed . He recorded the words of those who were capable of both like a sighted man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was another small town burdened with a whimsical name . On its Main Street , two closed-down gas stations faced each other from opposite corners . At one the corroded pumps still stood , nearly paintless , sinking into cracked cement . At the other they 'd dug out the fuel tanks and covered the lot with gravel . ( The new gas station , a self-service franchise that sold packaged sandwiches , milk , and doughnuts , was two miles away on the highway . ) It was a town losing ground by both inches and leaps . <p> There was a Red Star Market , an auto-body shop , and two churches built of the same liver-colored brick , one for the Methodists , one a United Church of Christ . A row of false-front buildings , empty except for the Honeybee Bakery . A gift shop that accommodated a post office . A new flat-roofed mini-mall housing an insurance agency and a laundromat . There was a pizza restaurant , a feed store , a tavern that sold hunting licenses , and a white frame cottage tricked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photographer intoned , as he steered the big car through the quiet streets . " Deep roots . America 's rural heritage . " The photographer 's name was Jencks , and his ambition was to take celebrity portraits . He was a young man , about the age of Mrs. Poole 's daughter Joy , Hughes figured . He wore clothes that Hughes , who was closer to Mrs. Poole 's age , found affected : everything baggy and drab , expensive garments meant to look like they came from thrift shops . His hair was combed back with some product that kept it looking wet . Jencks said , " They 'll never use a tombstone shot . Too kitschy . " <p> " Your talents are wasted on us , " agreed Hughes . He had stopped paying attention to Jencks some time during the 160-mile drive from Chicago . " Turn here . " " It is kind of pretty , " offered Jencks . " It could be on a calendar for an insurance agency . " <p> The shade trees showed spots of pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shining green or blue reflector balls set on pedestals , objects Hughes had not seen since his childhood . Tomato plants and cucumber vines hung on in the gardens . There was a dusty bloom laid over everything , the kindly aspect of decay . <p> " Tell me again , " said Jencks . " Why are we here ? I mean , what 's the big draw ? " <p> " Mrs. Poole wrote the paper a letter . " <p> " The paper with a heart , " said Jencks . His face went slack , as if he had surprised himself and said what he meant . <p> A young man sat on the front steps of a house on the corner . In spite of the cool weather he was shirtless , his lean , elongated chest looking nearly anatomical , a working model of ribs and muscles . He wore blue jeans and scuffed black boots . His hair was shaggy , the color of broom straw , and in his shadowed face his eyes were unexpectedly light and piercing , like a malamute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment before Hughes was borne away . If someone besides Jencks had been in the car , Hughes would have said what he felt , that Kelly Poole had been killed by a boy exactly like that , or maybe that same boy : young , bored , fitfully employed , knowing nothing of himself or anyone else , and with a talent for meanness . <p> The cemetery was a long mile outside of Superior , beyond the remains of a lumberyard . It occupied the grounds of a disused church , the ancestor of one of the new brick constructions in town . The old church was white painted board , outfitted with a steeple , and coming unknit at all its angles . The graves were laid out in rows , like corn . The oldest stones went back to the end of the last century and were smooth , nearly featureless , the dead who had become entirely dead . Some of the plots were ornamented with bits of ribbon , chrysanthemums in coffee cans , or artificial geraniums . " This is so sad , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of wire-and-tissue rosettes , the thick grimed plastic petals . By that Hughes thought he meant it was in bad taste . <p> " Where is it you 'd like to be buried ? " asked Hughes , wanting Jencks to shut up . He 'd found Kelly Poole 's gravestone . It was pink granite with two interlocked hearts , and " FOREVER " chiseled above the name and dates . There was a grain or sheen in the stone , something that sparkled . <p> " Hearts , " said Jencks , meaning it ironically . <p> " She was stabbed in the heart , " said Hughes . <p> Jencks went back to the car for his cameras and worked in silence , kneeling , focusing , squeezing off shots . The cemetery was on a rise , and Hughes looked around him in all directions , back east towards town , north to the railroad tracks and the tree line beyond , south across a chewed-looking hayfield , then west , where the small white sun was lowering itself behind a knobby hill . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its stiff leather cases . He already had pictures of Mrs. Poole and her house , a copy of Kelly Poole 's portrait , and other , possibly useful shots of Superior and environs . " We gone . " <p> " Take me over to Anderson , " said Hughes . Anderson was twenty miles away , the nearest metropolis , where people went when they needed a doctor or a bank , shoes , refrigerators , jobs . " I want to get a rental car . " <p> Jencks said , " I feel obliged to point out that you already have a rental car . " <p> " You 're going back . I 'm staying overnight . I want another crack at the boyfriend . " Hughes was pleased to think that he 'd just had his last conversation with Jencks , although Jencks said a few more things . " Mmn , " said Hughes . " Mmnhm . " At the rental-car office he fished his things our of the trunk and gave Jencks his sunniest smile and wave . <p> Hughes equipped himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He called in for his messages . He tried to reach Kelly Poole 's boyfriend at the number Mrs. Poole had given him , but got no answer . He set up his laptop computer and reviewed his files . More and more , he Liked working outside of the office . He preferred these assignments to transcribing the accusations of one politician against another , or reading the entrails of press releases . He liked being alone in utilitarian rooms and eating out of paper bags . He searched out opportunities for solitude . He had been a reporter for most of his life , and sometimes he seemed to himself like a stirred cup , or a gong beating in a metal chamber , too full of noise and push and other people 's stories : grand , indifferent , tragic , or vapid . Every chord in him had been struck over and over , until the strings were loosened . There was nothing that could not be hyped up , sentimentalized , made obvious and meaningless . <p> But he liked Mrs. Poole . If he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said " God bless you , " or something like that , on his way out he door . <p> Kelly Poole 's boyfriend 's name was Dean Kinshaw , and he ran a car wash and detail shop in Anderson . Hughes was there early , before it opened . It had rained just before dawn . Puddles reflected the moving sky , which was the color of cement and bruise . Cold fogs rose up . The car wash was built of white cinder block and occupied a triangle of space on a commercial artery . Traffic rolled and braked . Hughes sat in the front seat of his rental car , curling his fingers around a coffee cup , breathing in steam and exhaust . <p> There was a billboard overhead , one he 'd seen a number of times since yesterday , an advertisement for a counseling center . " Life Is Hard , " it stated flatly , next to a starkly lit picture of a spectacled man gazing at some unseen inward blankness . The line of his mouth was thin and sealed . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough like him to be a photograph . Or rather , it was his face as it might appear if no one else was watching it . <p> A maroon panel van pulled into the driveway , all its doors seeming to open at once . A small man and smaller woman emerged , followed by three children who seemed to be nearly the same age and size , like a nest of mice . The children carried expedition gear : a portable television , a cooler , paper sacks , gym bags . <p> Hughes stood in the office door until someone , the woman , noticed him . The children were already strewing their goods around the shop , unhooking the vacuum-cleaner hoses to use in tug-of-war , feeding quarters into the pop machine , preparing for their day just as seriously as the adults . When the woman nudged him the man stubbed the end of his cigarette into the concrete and crossed the room . " Help you ? " <p> Hughes introduced himself and gave the name of his newspaper . It was a weighty name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh . It intimidated them , or got them defensive and riled up . Dean Kinshaw reached for the cigarette he 'd been smoking and found it missing . He was older than Hughes had expected , in his late twenties , undersized , hollow-chested , black-haired and pale , with a slight , angular , handsome face . The stray seed of some lost black Irishman , grown up among weeds . <p> " I know why you 're here , " Kinshaw said . " Bonita called me . She 's all excited . I do n't see what she expects to come of it . Talk . There 's things you should n't have to keep saying . " <p> Hughes suggested getting a cup of coffee . Kinshaw shook his head . " Let 's make this one quick . " <p> " Would later today be any better for you ? " <p> " Never would be better for me , " said Kinshaw . He fished in his breast pocket for a new cigarette , setting off a rattle of cellophane . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimney . " <p> " Everything 's bad for you , " agreed Hughes . <p> " I worked nights then . That night . You know that already , I bet . I was over at the foundry . I quit because my nerves went out . I still ca n't do a lot of things . Like drive . You know what I mean ? They put you back together with pills , and the pills make you sweat and pee funny and bite your tongue until it bleeds . Just so you know where I 'm coming from . I do n't see what good a newspaper is here . No newspaper ever raised the dead , last I heard . " <p> Hughes thought of the stream of letters the paper got , the lost and losing causes , petitions for redress of grievances , prayers , confessions , accusations , cranks , victims , unsung heroes wanting to be sung , miracle seekers all . <p> " Do you believe in God , Mr. Hughes ? " <p> Hughes glanced at him , but there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious and remote , gazing out the open door . <p> " No , " said Hughes . " Not lately , I do n't . " <p> " Well I do . I have to . Because God 's the only one who can really kick ass . " <p> Kinshaw leaned in over his lighter . The small flame hollowed out his narrow , handsome face . Hughes felt sorry for Kinshaw , which was different than liking him . Weakness always made him sorry . He thought of Kelly Poole watching Kinshaw just like this , bent over his cupped hands . Hughes tried to make himself quiet inside . He wanted his mind to be as a tree branch is to a bird , he wanted to coax the vision closer , see what she 'd seen in all the faces she 'd known . Kinshaw straightened , calling , " Sharon . " <p> The woman detached herself from the telephone and came to stand beside Kinshaw . She had short brown hair and a round shy face . " This is Sharon . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sharon 's children had the television hooked up and were piled in front of it watching a show , ignoring the adults . Kinshaw said , " Life goes on .

Everybody . Kelly was tough . She fought him hard . Her shoulder was dislocated . I 've already gone and said too much . " <p> " Life is hard , " said Hughes , to no one . He was back in his car , driving the two-lane highway from Anderson to Superior . " Life is hard , and then it goes on . " For some , he added silently . The weather had shifted overnight from dry to damp , the first step down the long slope that led to winter . A shrill unfriendly wind scoured the corn stubble and shredded the leaves . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd complained about it to her girlfriends . The last night of her life she 'd left her mother 's house at ten o'clock . She was bored and fretful , and sometimes kids she knew hung out at the Denny 's seven miles away . It was a school night , but she and her friends were n't very serious about school . They were seniors , and were not expected to take it seriously . <p> At Denny 's she sat in a booth with two other girls , ordering Diet Cokes and french fries . There was never anything to do nights , they agreed . This lace , they said , rolling their eyes . If they lived anywhere else in the world , there would be something to do . Kelly said she was thinking of skipping school the next day . She borrowed three dollars for gas to get home . She yawned and contemplated the tabletop universe of crumpled straw wrappers , circles of damp , the smudged creamer , the cradle of pink saccharine packets , everything familiar and unremarkable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They left Denny 's at eleven-thirty , trotting across the parking lot with their hands in their pockets , shivering . Kelly hopped on one foot , looking for her keys . Her friends waited in their car , the engine running , while she went through a pantomime of exasperation : Do you believe this , how dumb , I mean , really dumb . Then she dredged the keys out and held them up in triumph . <p> Hughes stopped his car in front of the Red Star Market , with its banners advertising pork and beans , heads of cauliflower , dish soap . Two pickups were parked by the feed store , and an old woman with a head scarf like a bandage was entering the laundromat . Wood smoke rose from a chimney down the street . The life of the town had retreated indoors , like a green plant set in a silent room . <p> When he stepped into the wind he tasted stinging grit .

He knew how small towns worked . The man leaned his backside comfortably against the counter . " You 're from the newspaper . " <p> Hughes introduced himself and shook hands . " Bob Larrabee , " the man said . " Care to join us ? " Hughes piloted his coffee cup to their table . There were five of them , substantial men with solid handshakes and meaty , weatherbeaten faces . Hughes edged into a seat and they shifted heavily to accommodate him .

The porch was a broken lump of cement , set at a little distance from the front door . At that moment the light-eyed boy came around the corner of the garage . He was wearing a denim jacket unbuttoned over a T-shirt . As before , he stared at the car , a long , wolfish , disinterestedly rude stare . In his hands were a loop of frayed electrical cord and an open pocket knife . <p> Hughes kept driving , his hands steady on the wheel , but he felt as if an alarm were ringing within him , as if the skin had been ripped from the ordinary surface of the world .

" Hughes asked , just as if he himself had a reason . <p> " Oh , Dean ca n't come out here . So I do . For him , sort of . It 's not a jealous thing with me . It 's real peaceful here , do n't you think ? Some people it scares them . Not me . " <p> " It is peaceful , " he agreed . He felt himself calming . He wanted Sharon to keep talking . He thought this was what Kinshaw valued in her , calmness . <p> " Dean paid for the stone , " said Sharon . " Did you know that ? But he 's never once seen it . He was in the hospital for the funeral . I think one reason he took up with me and the kids is there 's so many of us . No matter what happened , there would still be someone left for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses and beaded on the creamy skin of the roses . " Did you know her ? " <p> Sharon shook her head . " She was so pretty . I 've seen all her pictures . <p> And full of spirit , like a little wild horse . He tells me all about her . She was n't a bad girl , no matter what people say . She was just young . She was perfect the way she was . Put that part in the paper . " Hughes shook his head . " Ah , Sharon . " <p> " Sure you can .

The boundaries of the world were indistinct . The dead were slipping through the tree line , through the soft fences of memory . His own death approached him , neither very far away nor entirely near . He recognized it with a certain relief , as he might recall the name of an acquaintance who had been smiling at him from a crowd all along . He was only one of the dead who were not yet dead . <p> " I should get on home , " said Sharon . " He frets if I 'm not back by dark . Drive careful . You 'll have some real rain up north . If there 's room in your story , put that he will love her forever . " <p>
