The man with the rubber boots stepped into the elevator behind me , but I did n't see him at first . I smelled him though  --  the pungent odor of smoke and cheap wine and life on the street without soap . We were alone as we moved upward , and when I finally glanced over I saw the boots , black and dirty and much too large . A frayed and tattered trench coat fell to his knees . Under it , layers of foul clothing bunched around his midsection , so that he appeared stocky , almost fat . But it was n't from being well fed ; in the wintertime in D.C. , the street people wear everything they own , or so it seems . He was black and aging -- his beard and hair were half-gray and had n't been washed or cut in years . He looked straight ahead through thick sunglasses , thoroughly ignoring me , and making me wonder for a second why , exactly , I was inspecting him . He did n't belong . It was not his building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford . The lawyers on all eight floors worked for my firm at hourly rates that still seemed obscene to me , even after seven years . Just another street bum in from the cold . Happened all the time in downtown Washington . But we had security guards to deal with the riffraff . We stopped at six , and I noticed for the first time that he had not pushed a button , had not selected a floor . He was following me . I made a quick exit , and as I stepped into the splendid marble foyer of Drake &; Sweeney I glanced over my shoulder just long enough to see him standing in the elevator , looking at nothing , still ignoring me . Madam Devier , one of our very resilient receptionists , greeted me with her typical look of disdain . " Watch the elevator , " I said . " Why ? " " Street bum . You may want to call security . " " Those people , " she said in her affected French accent . " Get some disinfectant too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shoulders , forgetting the man with the rubber boots . I had nonstop meetings throughout the afternoon , important conferences with important people . I turned the corner and was about to say something to Polly , my secretary , when I heard the first shot . Madam Devier was standing behind her desk , petrified , staring into the barrel of an awfully long handgun held by our pal the street bum . Since I was the first one to come to her aid , he politely aimed it at me , and I too became rigid . " Do n't shoot , " I said , hands in the air . I 'd seen enough movies to know precisely what to do . " Shut up , " he mumbled , with a great deal of composure . There were voices in the hallway behind me . Someone yelled , " He 's got a gun ! " And then the voices disappeared into the background , growing fainter and fainter as my colleagues hit the back door . I could almost see them jumping out the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led to a large conference room , which at that moment happened to be filled with eight lawyers from our litigation section . Eight hardnosed and fearless litigators who spent their hours chewing up people . The toughest was a scrappy little torpedo named Rafter , and as he yanked open the door saying " What the hell ? " the barrel swung from me to him , and the man with the rubber boots had exactly what he wanted . " Put that gun down , " Rafter ordered from the doorway , and a split second later another shot rang through the reception area , a shot that went into the ceiling somewhere well above Rafter 's head and reduced him to a mere mortal . Turning the gun back to me , he nodded , and I complied , entering the conference room behind Rafter . The last thing I saw on the outside was Madam Devier shaking at her desk , terror-stricken , headset around her neck , high heels parked neatly next to her wastebasket . The man with the rubber boots slammed the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air so that all eight litigators could admire it . It seemed to be working fine ; the smell of its discharge was more noticeable than the odor of its owner . The room was dominated by a long table , covered with documents and papers that only seconds ago seemed terribly important . A row of windows overlooked a parking lot . Two doors led to the hallway . " Up against the wall , " he said , using the gun as a very effective prop . Then he placed it very near my head , and said , " Lock the doors . " Which I did . Not a word from the eight litigators as they scrambled backward . Not a word from me as I quickly locked the doors , then looked at him for approval . For some reason , I kept thinking of the post office and all those horrible shootings -- a disgruntled employee returns after lunch with an arsenal and wipes out fifteen of his co-workers . I thought of the playground massacres -- and the slaughters at fast-food restaurants . And those victims were innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lawyers ! Using a series of grunts and gun thrusts , he lined the eight litigators up against the wall , and when their positions suited him he turned his attention to me . What did he want ? Could he ask questions ? If so , he could get anything he damned well pleased . I could n't see his eyes because of the sunglasses , but he could see mine . The gun was pointed at them . He removed his filthy trench coat , folded it as if it were new , and placed it in the center of the table . The smell that had bothered me in the elevator was back , but not important now . He stood at the end of the table and slowly removed the next layer -- a bulky gray cardigan . Bulky for a reason . Under it , strapped to his waist , was a row of red sticks , which appeared to my untrained eye to be dynamite . Wires ran like colored spaghetti from the tops and bottoms of the sticks , and silver duct tape kept things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunge with arms and legs flapping and flailing for the door , and hope for luck , hope for a bad shot as I scrambled for the lock , then another bad shot as I fell through the doorway into the hallway . But my knees shook and my blood ran cold . There were gasps and slight moans from the eight against the wall , and this perturbed our captor . " Please be quiet , " he said in the tone of a patient professor . His calmness unnerved me . He adjusted some of the spaghetti around his waist , then from a pocket in his large trousers produced a neat bundle of yellow nylon rope and a switchblade . For good measure , he waved the gun at the horrified faces in front of him , and said , " I do n't want to hurt anybody . " That was nice to hear but hard to take seriously . I counted twelve red sticks -- enough , I was certain , to make it instantaneous and painless . Then the gun was back on me . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rafter had had enough . He took one very small step forward and said , " Look , pal , just exactly what do you want ? " The third shot sailed over his head into the ceiling , where it lodged harmlessly . It sounded like a cannon , and Madam Devier or some female shrieked in the foyer . Rafter ducked , and as he attempted to stand upright the beefy elbow of Umstead caught him squarely in the chest and returned him to his position against the wall . " Shut up , " Umstead said with clenched jaws . " Do not call me Pal , " the man said , and Pal was instantly discarded as a reference . " What would you like us to call you ? " I asked , sensing that I was about to become the leader of the hostages . I said this very delicately , with great deference , and he appreciated my respect . " Mister , " he said . Mister was perfectly fine with everyone in the room . The phone rang , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Instead he waved it over , and I placed it squarely before him on the table . He lifted the receiver with his left hand ; his right still held the gun , and the gun was still pointed at Rafter . If the nine of us had a vote , Rafter would be the first sacrificial lamb . Eight to one . " Hello , " Mister said . He listened briefly , then hung up . He carefully backed himself into the seat at the end of the table and sat down . " Take the rope , " he said to me . He wanted all eight of them attached at the wrists . I cut rope and tied knots and tried my best not to look at the faces of my colleagues as I hastened their deaths . I could feel the gun at my back . He wanted them bound tightly , and I made a show of practically drawing blood while leaving as much slack as possible . Rafter mumbled something under his breath and I wanted to slap him . Umstead was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell loose when I finished with him . Malamud was sweating and breathing rapidly . He was the oldest , the only partner , and two years past his first heart attack . I could n't help but look at Barry Nuzzo , my one friend in the bunch . We were the same age , thirty-two , and had joined the firm the same year . He went to Princeton , I went to Yale . Both of our wives were from Providence . His marriage was working --  three kids in four years . Mine was in the final stage of a long deterioration . Our eyes met and we both were thinking about his kids . I felt lucky to be childless . The first of many sirens came into range , and Mister instructed me to close the blinds over the five large windows . I went about this methodically , scanning the parking lot below as if being seen might somehow save me . A lone police car sat empty with its lights on ; the cops were already in the building . And there we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Drake &; Sweeney had eight hundred lawyers in offices around the world . Half of them were in D.C. , in the building Mister was terrorizing . He instructed me to call " the boss " and inform him that he was armed and wired with twelve sticks of dynamite . I called Rudolph , managing partner of my division , antitrust , and relayed the message . " You okay , Mike ? " he asked me . We were on Mister 's new speakerphone , at full volume . " Wonderful , " I said . " Please do whatever he wants . " " What does he want ? " " I do n't know yet . " Mister waved the gun and the conversation was over . Taking my cue from the pistol , I assumed a standing position next to the conference table , a few feet from Mister , who had developed the irritating habit of playing absentmindedly with the wires coiled against his chest . He glanced down and gave a slight tug at a red wire . " This red one here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . " The sunglasses were looking at me when he finished this little warning . I felt compelled to say something . " Why would you do that ? " I asked , desperate to open a dialogue . " I do n't want to , but why not ? " I was struck by his diction -- a slow , methodical rhythm with no hurry and each syllable getting equal treatment . He was a street bum at the moment , but there had been better days . " Why would you want to kill us ? " I asked . " I 'm not going to argue with you , " he announced . No further questions , Your Honor . Because I 'm a lawyer and live by the clock , I checked my watch so that whatever happened could be duly recorded , if we somehow managed to survive . It was one-twenty . Mister wanted things quiet , and so we endured a nerve-racking period of silence that lasted fourteen minutes . I could not believe that we were going to die . There appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was certain that none of us had ever met him before . I remembered the ride on the elevator , and the fact that he seemed to have no particular destination . He was just a nut in search of hostages , which unfortunately would have made the killings seem almost normal by today 's standards . It was precisely the kind of senseless slaughter that would grab the headlines for twenty-four hours and make people shake their heads . Then the dead lawyer jokes would start . I could see the headlines and hear the reporters , but I refused to believe it would happen . I heard voices in the foyer , sirens outside ; a police radio squawked somewhere down the hallway . " What did you eat for lunch ? " Mister asked me , his voice breaking the silence . Too surprised to consider lying , I hesitated for a second , then said , " A grilled chicken Caesar . " " Alone ? " " No , I met a friend . " He was a law school buddy from Philly . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Thirty bucks . " He did n't like this . " Thirty bucks , " he repeated . " For two people . " He shook his head , then looked at the eight litigators . If he polled them , I hoped they planned to lie . There were some serious stomachs among the group , and thirty bucks would n't cover their appetizers . " You know what I had ? " he asked me . " No . " " I had soup . Soup and crackers at a shelter . Free soup , and I was glad to get it . You could feed a hundred of my friends for thirty bucks , you know that ? " I nodded gravely , as if I suddenly realized the weight of my sin . " Collect all the wallets , money , watches , jewelry , " he said , waving the gun again . " May I ask why ? " I asked . " No . " I placed my wallet , watch , and cash on the table , and began rummaging through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next of kin , " Mister said , and we all exhaled . He instructed me to place the loot in a briefcase , lock it , and call " the boss " again . Rudolph answered on the first ring . I could envision the SWAT leader camped in his office . " Rudolph , it 's me , Mike , again . I 'm on the speakerphone . " " Yes , Mike . Are you okay ? " " Just fine . Look , this gentleman wants me to open the door nearest the reception area and place a black briefcase in the hallway . I will then close the door and lock it . Understand ? " " Yes . " With the gun touching the back of my head , I slowly cracked the door and tossed the briefcase into the hallway . I did not see a person anywhere . Few things can keep a big-firm lawyer from the joys of hourly billing . Sleep is one , though most of us slept little . Eating actually encouraged billing , especially lunch when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes dragged on , I caught myself wondering how in the world the other four hundred lawyers in the building would manage to bill while waiting for the hostage crisis to end . I could just see them out there in the parking lot , most of them sitting in their cars to keep warm , chatting away on cell phones , billing somebody . The firm , I decided , would n't miss a beat . Some of the cutthroats down there did n't care how it ended . Just hurry up and get it over with . Mister seemed to doze for a second . His chin dipped , and his breathing was heavier . Rafter grunted to get my attention , then jerked his head to one side as if to suggest I make a move . Problem was , Mister held the gun with his right hand , and if he was indeed napping , then he was doing so with the dreaded red wire held firmly in his left hand . And Rafter wanted me to be the hero . Though Rafter was the meanest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet a partner . He was not in my division , and we were n't in the Army . I did n't take orders . " How much money did you make last year ? " Mister , very much awake , asked me , his voice clear . Again , I was startled . " I , uh , gosh , let me see --  " " Do n't lie . " " A hundred and twenty thousand . " He did n't like this either . " How much did you give away ? " " Give away ? " " Yes . To charities . " " Oh . Well , I really do n't remember . My wife takes care of the bills and things like that . " All eight litigators seemed to shift at once . Mister did n't like my answer , and he was not about to be denied . " Who , like , fills in your tax forms ? " " You mean for the IRS ? " " Yeah , that 's it . " " It 's handled by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here in this building ? " " Yes . " " Then get it for me . Get me the tax records for everybody here . " I looked at their faces , and a couple wanted to say , " Just go ahead and shoot me . " I must 've hesitated too long , because Mister shouted , " Do it now ! " And he used the gun when he shouted . I called Rudolph , who also hesitated , and so I shouted at him . " Just fax them in here , " I demanded . " Last year 's only . " We stared at the fax machine in the corner for fifteen minutes , afraid Mister might start executing us if our 1040 's did n't hurry along .
