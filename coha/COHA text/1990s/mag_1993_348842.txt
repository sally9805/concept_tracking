TITLE : CHARMS FOR THE EASY LIFE <P> AUTHOR : KAYE GIBBONS <P> PUBLISHER : PUTNAM ; 254 PAGES ; $19.95 <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : Three generations of Carolina women , one better than the next , are told by a fourth , the best yet . <P> SOME PEOPLE MIGHT GIVE UP their second-born to write as well as Kaye Gibbons , so graceful and spirited are her fictional histories of North Carolina women . In her fourth novel , Charms for the Easy Life , Gibbons presents Charlie Kate Birch , a midwife and self-proclaimed doctor who meets her ferryman husband as she crosses the Pasquotank River to deliver babies , nurse the sick and lay out the dead . Her granddaughter Margaret , narrator of the book , imagines , " Between my grandmother , her green eyes . . . and the big-cookie moon low over the Pasquotank , it must have been all my grandfather could do to deposit her on the other side of the river . " <P> That 's the first and last romantic view of Charlie Kate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for breakfast , smells of mothballs and ties her " resolute shoes " with 30-year-old laces soaked every Sunday in linseed oil ( " My shoestrings , " she says , " have lasted years longer than most people can stand each other " ) . An eccentric who knows as much about Thomas Hardy 's novels as she does about cirrhosis of the liver , Charlie Kate is in fact a healing genius who uses herbal cures like evening primrose and Saint-John's-Wort , as well as all the modern medicine she can get . <P> But her best healing power lies in her self . She is in full possession of easy-life charm , and it is her " winning streak " of a life that she passes on to her daughter Sophia and to Margaret : " I trusted my grandmother . Everything she had ever said had been true , and I had long since learned to do whatever she told me to do . Trusting her to guide me . . . was like falling backward like her chloroformed women , knowing that not only would I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized I was falling . " <P> Men pass through now and then . But they 're mostly sketchy figures in suits and uniforms , the sorely afflicted or , like the ferryman , no-accounts who come to stud and go off to do something else . In 1910 the Birches move from Pasquotank to Raleigh , where matriarch Charlie Kate raises her daughter and granddaughter , practices medicine and becomes a Wake County legend : " Remember when she got Tessa Jerrod 's arm out of the wringer ? . . . Buttercup Spivey 's dropped kidneys rose . Malcolm Taylor stopped wanting to scratch his missing leg . Everybody saw the miracles all around . " <P> But Margaret 's miracle is her grandmother . From pamphlets on birth control to instructions about courting ( " He 's not going to leave you alone . Not since Satan tackled Eve has somebody gone after a person as hard as he 'll go after you " ) , through the Depression and into World War II , Gibbons paints this medicine woman in colors as pungent as mashed garlic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea . The charm for the reader is that there is still such a thriving population of Southern women left in the author 's well-healed imagination .
