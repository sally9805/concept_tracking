SYMPOSIUM Arts Education in Early Childhood <p> I was recently visiting a class in a child care center . During the activity period , the children were given a choice of centers where they could work or play . One of these was an art center that included an easel and juice cans partly filled with three different colored paints , with brushes on each side . The table in the art center held a large tray that contained several different materials ( bits of colored cloth , feathers , shiny colored paper , and the like ) along with squeeze bottles of white glue . The children who chose the art center could make anything they wanted . There was no interference from the teacher , as long as they used the material " properly . " <p> The teacher told me that she had shown the children how to make collages some weeks before . She wanted the children to express themselves , so she was careful not to interfere with their work or to impose herself on what the children were doing . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their products carefully on a shelf to dry . Each product was duly praised with such phrases as " That 's nice " or " You did a good job . " The teacher told me that art activities are always available to the children during the activity period . Each day , a different art activity was set up : one day , it was collage ; another day , clay modeling ; yet another day , string painting ; and so on . In addition , crayons and markers were always available . <p> Toward the end of the morning , the teacher signaled that it was time to end the activity period . After the children helped to clean up the room , they washed up and sat down on the rug to wait while the tables were set for lunch . While the children were waiting , the teacher played a record on which a single male voice accompanied by a guitar sang lyrics about colors . The next song on the record was about numbers . <p> The two episodes I observed on the same morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost any participant or observer in preschool classes could bring to mind . They are typical of the ways that art and music activities are provided to children in such classes . Of course , there may also be opportunities for children to sing and to move to music . In addition , there may be opportunities to engage in specific craft projects , especially before holidays . <p> But while the activities I observed are typical , are they educationally worthwhile ? The activities were certainly developmentally appropriate . The children were not forced to do things they were incapable of , nor were they subjected to academic learning beyond their capability . But judging these activities to be development tally appropriate is not enough . We must also ask whether the activities are educationally appropriate and worthwhile . One way to answer the question is to determine whether the purposes of the activities were accomplished , and  --  possibly more important  --  whether the purposes themselves were worthwhile . The purposes of the art activities must also be assessed in terms of the goals of early childhood education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the purposes that the arts have served in early childhood education as a way of understanding how the art portion of the early childhood program has developed . Then I want to discuss some of the contemporary proposals for art in early childhood programs . Finally , I will suggest a framework for selecting art activities for early childhood education programs and provide examples of what would be educationally appropriate art activities for young children . Arts Activities in Early Childhood Education <p> Arts activities in early childhood education include the graphic and plastic arts , music , movement or dance , and creative dramatics and other language arts . These serve a number of purposes : they provide a means of expression for children , a vehicle for creative development , a way of symbolizing and communicating knowledge gained in other activities , a vehicle for teaching about aesthetics , and a way to help children access academic knowledge . The arts also serve as a device to help with classroom management . <p> The music activity I described earlier was used both as a classroom management device and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preacademics ) . Although these may be considered worthy goals , they unfortunately have nothing to do with music . Music served only as a vehicle for achieving goals outside of music . What was forgotten was the goal of teaching children about music . <p> What about the art experience I described ? The children in the class had many experiences with many different kinds of art media over time . They may also have had the opportunity to express themselves . Self-expression is an important activity for children , so important that the Convention on the Rights of Children , adopted by the United Nations in 1989 and ratified in 1990 , has an article on the rights of children to self-expression . But how well did the children express themselves in these activities ? Did they learn to control the media that were provided for them to make their expressions more precise ? They might have discovered new uses for the material provided , but could they make these uses part of their repertoire of expression ? More important from my point of view , did the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , teachers in early childhood classes seldom concern themselves with the possible goals of art activities and the relationship of those goals to the arts themselves . This is surprising , considering the traditional importance of the arts in early childhood education . The arts , it seems , have had a central role in early childhood programs since they were first conceived . The performing arts were an important part of the curriculum of Robert Owen 's Infant School , first developed in New Lanark , Scotland , in the early 1800s . Children were provided with opportunities to learn music , to sing by ear , and to dance . They learned Scottish reels , country dances , and quadrilles. 1 <p> Friedrich Froebel 's kindergarten was developed in the 1830s in Germany and accompanied the Germans who migrated to the United States in the 1850s . The occupations were an important part of Froebel 's programs . These activities allowed children to work with clay and cardboard , to draw , weave paper , fold paper , cut paper , embroider , and weave . Songs and games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Within the development of the nursery school in England , the arts were seen as a way to develop children 's imagination . Margaret Macmillan , who created the nursery school in England , was also interested in children 's expression . Children 's artistic expressions were to be products of their imagination . An important goal of early childhood education was the education of the imagination . Since adult intervention could inhibit imaginative expression , children were pretty much left alone in their art . Thus the nursery school provided a rich array of materials and supplies that would enable children to broadly express their ideas and feelings . Children 's imaginations were given free rein , not only within the visual arts , but also in movement and music . Skills were not taught to children , since it was feared that a focus on skill development would limit children 's freedom of expression . Margaret Macmillan was interested in educating the imagination of young children . She saw this as a necessity if the children that she taught  --  children of the poor  --  might someday be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play were the vehicle for this education. 3 <p> In contrast , there was no place for art in Montessori programs for young children . Maria Montessori saw truth as the basis of artistic imagination . According to Montessori , humans observe material reality ; what is created in the imagination is based upon that reality . In Montessori 's view , the early childhood years are best served by helping children gain ways of observing that reality and learning to organize those observations to make sense of them , classifying , seriating , and numerating elements in that reality . Only when children are older and when they can clearly distinguish between fantasy and reality can the imagination be properly educated. 4 <p> Our changing knowledge of child development has led to changes in our conceptions of early childhood education . The child study movement , which developed at the end of the nineteenth century , represented a new development in the study of humanity . It sought to study how human beings changed from birth through adulthood and to examine that change in a scientific way . A number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are observed in children . Each theory suggests a different role for education in general and for early childhood education in particular . <p> For the major part of the twentieth century , the theory with the greatest influence in early childhood education has been the maturationist theory that was proposed by Arnold Gesell and others . This theory suggests that at birth , children have the inherent capacity to become adults . Each child 's particular attributes , including skills and competencies that develop , are genetically determined . In the normal process of development , these attributes would unfold as a result of maturation . <p> The role of education , from this point of view , was to allow the genetically determined qualities of each individual to unfold and to keep the child safe and healthy so that the normal process of development would be able to run its course . Education was to support and follow rather than to lead and extend development . <p> This conception of development greatly influenced early childhood education over a long period of time . Its theory was used , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reconstruct the Froebelian kindergarten into the reform kindergarten . <p> The child study movement , and later the field of child development , was also closely linked with the development of nursery school education ( originally established by Margaret Macmillan in England ) since its introduction in the United States in the 1920s . Laboratory nursery schools , established as extensions of university child development programs , provided a ready source of subjects for child development research . And while the children were held to be used by the researchers in their studies , some sort of experiences had to be provided for them . These experiences were often designed to reflect the latest theories in child development  --  whether related to social-emotional development , cognitive development , or physical development . Thus , studies that described what children were like led to prograins designed to help young children become . <p> Until the 1960s , early childhood education teachers were advised to follow children in developing their curriculum , rather than to lead them . They were to construct an educational setting in which children would be nurtured and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be avoided . Teachers were also to provide children with opportunities to interact with their environment and to use their intelligence to make sense of the environment . While art could help children to make sense of their environment , it was to be the children 's , rather than the teachers ' , sense of the world that was expressed in art . These progressive kindergarten and prekindergarten programs provided opportunities for children to express the ideas they gained through their encounters with their environment . Maturationist theory went hand-in-hand with a romantic ideology of early childhood education. 5 <p> The psychoanalytic movement also influenced the early childhood educator 's view of the expressive nature of art . In this view , while art served to help children express their knowledge of the outside world , it also was a way to express inner feelings , needs , and desires , many of which might be held unconsciously . Children might not be aware of what they were expressing . As a matter of fact , some of these expressions would only come out in artistic form because the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs , and desires in a more direct way . Teachers ' intervention in children 's art work would limit the children 's expression of the unconscious and could ultimately lead to adult neurosis . On the other hand , unfettered expression could be mentally healthy and even serve as a form of therapy for children . <p> Teachers were taught that they might have to intrepret the artistic expressions of children , just as the psychoanalyst interprets the verbal expressions of adults . Because children might not be aware of the meanings expressed in their art work , only through the teacher 's interpretation would the meaning of the expressions be made clear . The child 's personality would become known , and the teacher would be in a better position to design meaningful educational experiences for the child. 6 Often it was felt that the children 's artistic expression served as a catharsis and mental health would be sustained through the arts . The freer forms of expression were valued . More Recent Conceptions of Art in Early Childhood Education <p> Nancy Smith has suggested that the emergence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freer forms of expression in children 's art in early childhood education. 7 The works of many of the modem artists were seen as parallel to the art works of young children . The insights expressed and the forms used by young children seemed much like those of artists like Dubuffet , Klee , Picasso , and other modern artists . It was felt that as children were educated , they lost their capacities to view the world and express views like these artists . In order to keep the natural intuitive expressive forms of early childhood , teachers should avoid imposing technique on children or making them too self-conscious about their artistic production . <p> All these influences-progressive education , maturationist and psychoanalytic conceptions of development , and modem art-converged in the work of Victor Lowenfeld , an art educator who migrated from Austria to the United States at the time of Hitler 's rise to power . Lowenfeld 's influence continues today and his classic textbook , Creative and Mental Growth , 8 continues to be used more than forty years after its introduction . The book , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of artistic expression in young children . It suggests that art education should follow development , and that teachers should not intervene in children 's art work . <p> More recently , this maturational view of artistic development has been criticized . Geraldine Dimondstein suggested that this view tends to inhibit teachers ' fresh perceptions of the specific qualities of children 's art products. 9 Dimondstein suggested that teachers need to interpret children 's art products and determine the next steps for them in artistic development . Art education , at all levels , should be concerned with providing children with experiences and guidance to achieve those next steps . <p> Nancy Smith suggested that there are other elements beyond creativity , imaginativeness , and self-expression that are important in young children 's art . She noted that " art activities are important because they contribute to children 's capacity to make and understand meaning . " 10 Meanings are created through representation and symbolization . That is , the art creation , as it develops , comes to stand for an object , feeling , or idea . Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material , its referent , and the possible modes of correspondence between them . <p> Smith 's view of art is consistent with a constructivist view of cognitive development . Constructivists , including Jean Piaget , Lev Vygotsky , and Jerome Bruner , while having different views of the specific process , all characterize children as actively engaged in constructing meaning from their experiences  --  of making sense of the world . <p> Perhaps one of the ways that we need to judge the quality and appropriateness of early childhood experiences in the arts is in relation to the degree with which they contribute to children 's making sense of their world . Such contributions of the arts to meaning making can be found in the work of the Reggio Emilia nursery schools in Italy . These schools are gaining a great deal of attention in the United States today . They have been characterized as providing excellent early education. 11 The schools offer project-like activities in which children use their own observations to collect information about various aspects of the world around them . They then work with artists to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . A traveling exhibit of children 's work from Reggio Emilia toured the United States recently . While the projects did not focus on art , the representations were certainly artistic in nature . <p> The descriptions , exhibits , and videotapes of the program richly document the ways in which art is used consciously to help children gain knowledge of art material , as well as knowledge of their referent . The teachers and artists actively work with the children to help them see the many possible modes of correspondence between art material and referent . Interestingly , while artists serve as resource persons in these preschools , the program is not described as an art program . Art is used as a vehicle for children to gain meaning from their experiences and to order and express these meanings . The products that were shown , however , were very artistic . <p> Similar work in the arts can be found in Elwin Richardson 's book , In the Early World , and the accompanying film about art activities with young children in New Zealand. 12 Richardson was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his work was in tune with an approach to education that has been called Open Education . Visiting the English Infant Schools that practiced the " integrated day , " one often saw wonderful displays of artistic productions by children . In addition , the importance of the arts in these schools was communicated by the way classes were arranged and how materials , including children 's work , were displayed , and by the way that movement and drama as well as the graphic arts were integrated into the curriculum . The arts were among the ways of knowing that were being taught to children , and these artistic ways of knowing seemed to be equally valued with the sciences , mathematics , or literature . <p> In these programs , the expressions of young children  --  their drawings or paintings or clay works , their dances or dramatic productions  --  were valued both as works of art and as vehicles by which children could gain significant insights about their inner and outer worlds . This use of art as a vehicle for leaming is very different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days of the week . <p> Jessica Davis and Howard Gardner conceive of the young child as artist. 13 As artists , young children need to develop the symbolic tools of literacy in the visual arts . They also need to be able to " read " the aesthetic symbols of their culture . This need to develop literacy in aesthetic symbols is reflected in programs for older children that are characterized as Discipline-Based Art Education ( DBAE ) . This approach suggests that children need to be educated in art production , art history , art criticism , and aesthetics. 14 <p> The notion of the discipline of art as a basis of early childhood programs has not been explored , even by DBAE advocates . In general , it is the performance part of the arts that has been integrated into early childhood programs . It is worth exploring whether we could develop activities that help young children learn about art history , aesthetics , or art criticism , and still be appropriate to the ways that children come to understand the world . But helping children to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to " read " the aesthetic symbols of their culture is an intriguing idea . I think there have been some attempts at this in the visual arts . Much less has been done in the performing arts . <p> Davis and Gardner suggest that their approach has implications for early childhood education . Building on children 's intuitive knowledge , teachers can help children attend to the qualities of their art work . They can also surround children with mature art , especially works that parallel those of children as artists . Teachers can also provide children with tools for art and help them become more competent in their control of those tools . These elements can be provided in a framework of understanding the young child so that what is offered to children is developmentally appropriate . <p> Let me share an experience I had a few years ago with a kindergarten project in Euclid , Ohio , a working class suburb of Cleveland . The teacher , Kitty Rose , had decided that she wanted to experiment with an allday kindergarten ( she started this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimized ) . She did not want to duplicate in the afternoon what she had been doing with the children in the morning . She also did not want to bring the curriculum of the primary grades down into the kindergarten . Her approach was to enrich the kindergarten curriculum . She brought a computer into the classroom and found a retired mathematics teacher to serve as a resource person for the class . She took the children for swimming lessons at a nearby YMCA . Parent volunteers helped her . She brought in a Dalcroze teacher to teach eurythmics , a combination of music and movement . And she found a retired art teacher to develop an art program . <p> Once a month the children went to the Cleveland Art Museum . A resource person there planned a session for them each time . First , the children would be taken to one section of the museum to look at a small part of the exhibit . Once they looked at French impressionist paintings . Another time they looked at medieval armor . After viewing and discussing what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the museum where they did an art project related to the material they had viewed : painting with vivid colors , or making armor out of cardboard , for example . The work they did at the museum was carried over into the kindergarten . <p> I visited the class periodically in my role as consultant . Mostly what I did was validate the teachers ' work and suggest ways of evaluating the program . One time when I visited , I was struck by a set of children 's paintings displayed on the wall . The colors were bright and vivid . The children had used broad brushes . There was a play of light in the paintings . Some of the paintings were representational  --  a house , a flower . Others were not . The sign on the wall above the paintings said , " Painting in the Style of Van Gogh . " I talked to the teacher and learned that during the year , the children had studied the styles of several painters , looking at reproductions and talking about them . The children then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter . It seems to me that this is how young children could approach art criticism and art history and learn to read the aesthetic symbols of our culture . More projects , not only in the visual arts but in the performing arts , need to be developed along these lines . Exploring the Discipline of Art in Early Childhood Education <p> It would be interesting to speculate about applying the concepts of DBAE to early childhood education . While the original proposals recommended a curriculum for kindergarten to twelfth grade , the work developed has focused on elementary and secondary education . It seems plausible that it could be applied to the prekindergarten and kindergarten levels as well . <p> As noted earlier , DBAE consists of four components : art production , art history , art criticism , and aesthetics . Art production is a generally accepted part of early childhood programs and so will not be discussed here . There are many excellent texts on art in early childhood education that provide suggestions for art production. 15 Thus I will focus here on art history , art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the goal of activities that lead to the creation of art products should not be to create a product of which adults would approve . Rather , it should lead to the development of competency in the use of art media that would allow children to express their ideas and feelings with deliberateness and would be the result of children 's intentions , rather than happenstance . It might be best to focus on a limited number of media that would allow the children great latitude in expression and also help them become increasingly more competent in their use of the media . In this way , the children in these early childhood classes would truly become artists . <p> Art history . Research suggests that children below the primary grades lack the understanding of time to gain insights into formal history . There is evidence , however , that these children can learn some history if it is presented in a concrete manner. 16 Consequently , if we are to teach anything about art history to young children , it must be presented in a concrete form . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early Childhood Discovery Boxes of the Toledo Museum of Art , which has developed a set of self-contained activity boxes based on different art themes . Two of these discovery boxes deal with art history  --  one on ancient Egypt and the other on medieval Europe . <p> Each discovery box contains a teacher 's guide , a set of art reproductions related to the theme , a set of costumes and props , a set of books , an audio cassette tape , and other resources . Through the resources provided , the children learn about the time and culture related to the works of art . They can dress up and role-play activities of the period ; for example , writing hieroglyphics , building tombs , or making jewelry of the period that they can wear . They then learn about the works of art of the period , using the museum reproductions as examples . Providing the context information and the props for dramatic play allows the children to gain information about art history in a developmentally appropriate way . <p> Art criticism . E. Cole and C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialogues as they scrutinize a work of art. 17 They suggest using a model developed by E. Feldman , 18 which consists of four stages . The first stage , description , involves fisting all the visible qualities of the work of art . Determining the relationships between these qualities ( line , shape , color , texture , and balance ) is the stage of analysis . In the third stage , interpretation , the children are helped to focus on ideas , feelings , or moods conveyed by the art work . Finally , a conclusion , or judgment , is made about the art work based on information previously derived . <p> Cole and Schaefer suggested using this process with museum reproductions of art that could be kept in the classroom for several weeks . E. S. Richardson 19 suggested that a similar process could be implemented with the artwork that children create themselves . Thus , the children could learn that criticism is a process that they can engage in on a day-to-day basis as they of review their own work . This form criticism is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying within the lines while coloring or putting the eyes in the wrong place on a portrait . <p> Aesthetics . The importance of beauty in the lives of young children has been recognized by some early childhood educators . It has been included in the revised curriculum for kindergarten education in Japan . There are many ways in which we can make children more sensitive to the beauty that surrounds them and understand the aesthetic elements in their culture . A couple of examples from Japan come to mind . <p> Japanese kindergartens are often decorated with a large mural that may cover an entire wall . The mural is made by the teacher and includes a variety of material , including drawing , painting , and collage . The mural may reflect the season of the year or another theme . Often the mural includes many kinds of Japanese paper , reflecting a long tradition of paper making in Japan. 20 Although there is not a similar tradition of mural making in America , such murals could be incorporated into early childhood classrooms , which could be made more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be adopted from Japan is the tokonoma . This is an alcove in the tatami room that is found in traditional Japanese homes and inns . The rooms themselves , their floors covered with straw mats , or tatamis , are sparsely furnished . On one wall there is usually a small alcove that is devoted to the display of something beautiful  --  a scroll , a flower arrangement , or a piece of ceramics , for example . The display adds beauty to the surroundings . <p> Kindergarten or prekindergarten teachers could establish their own tokonoma or beauty area , just as they might have a science or nature display area . An art reproduction or a vase of flowers could be tastefully displayed in this area . The children could observe the display on their own and the teacher could engage them in discussions about ut the display and why it is considered beautiful . Similar displays and discussions were seen in the English Infant Schools during the height of the informal education movement , when children 's expression and aesthetics were valued in schools there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes is the use of art postcards , small reproductions of works of art that can be purchased in museums or gift shops . A. D. Wolf suggests such reproductions of subjects that are appealing to children should be provided for them to handle. 21 Children could learn to match identical reproductions to one another . Later , the reproductions could be paired to similar paintings by the same artist , and eventually grouped by artist . Using this approach , children could learn to appreciate a range of art works and also learn about artists and their times . These materials could be integrated with activities such as discovery boxes Eke those developed at the Toledo Museum of Art . <p> It should be noted that the art activities described are difficult to separate into the distinct elements of the discipline of art . Indeed , they should be presented in an integrated fashion . And the arts should be integrated with other activities in the classroom . Such integration needs to be planned , since activity centers in many preprimary classrooms are as segregated as the different academic subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities around themes or topics , as has been suggested elsewhere. 22 Not only does art production lead to greater conceptualization , as noted in the Reggio Emilia programs , but the roles of children as symbol makers  --  in the arts , in dramatic play , and in language activities  --  are all interrelated . Conclusion <p> The arts have long played an important role in early childhood programs . Unfortunately , they have been trivialized in too many contemporary programs . Rather than being designed to give children greater mastery over the creative process , art activities are too often used to provide children with shallow experiences with a variety of media , or they are used as a vehicle to teach things other than art . <p> If we are to correct this situation , then early childhood teachers must go beyond designing early childhood programs in the arts that are developmentally appropriate ; they should be educationauy appropriate as well . We also need to determine the educational worth of the activity  --  whether children are given greater power to make sense of their world and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disciplines is to help one understand some particular form of knowledge . Thus , science teaches us to think in one way  --  to generate hypotheses and to test them empirically . Mathematics teaches us to think another way . The disciplines of the arts reflect forms of knowledge that are just as valuable to young children at their particular level of development as they are to adolescents at their particular level of development . Each form of knowledge is accessible to young children and activities and experiences related to these disciplines help children think in increasingly more mature ways . <p> In order to achieve that power with children , activities need to be designed  --  to do more than keep children engaged during part of the daily schedule or be used as a vehicle for teaching academics . We have to help children access the core knowledge of that art . In order to identify that core , teachers of young children need to understand it . They need to ask , " What is dance ? When does a child 's movement activity become dance ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatics , and theatre ? " " How does one feed into the other ? " " Can we define the essential elements of each of the arts ? " " What of these elements are accessible to young children ? " <p> We also need to assess our current early childhood art activities and determine their validity for young children within the arts . Are the arts being used simply as a vehicle to achieve goals outside of the arts themselves ? Or are children being helped to understand the aesthetic qualities of their world ? And are children being helped to understand the nature of artistic expression and to use media in more meaningful ways from an artistic point of view ? When these latter questions can be answered affirmatively , then we are providing children with educationally worthwhile art experiences in their early childhood education programs . <p> <p>
