A hospital may be the most fascinating place we never want to visit . We know there are triumphs here : fingers reattached , lungs replaced and babies born , small enough to bathe in a big teacup , who would have had no chance 10 years ago but who now go home and grow up . Maybe they will become doctors too . But it is also a war zone , and if you are not fighting the enemy or loading the weapons or plotting the next campaign , you can hardly understand what a brave , brutal , mysterious place this really is . <P> That is one reason it has been possible for hospitals to reach a point of crisis without most of us knowing how it happened . When your child is lying on a stretcher , or your spouse is worrying about a lump , there is no time to learn about how these places work . You just want them to take care of you . One of the great democratic privileges of American society is the premise that all people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether they have the means to pay for it ; the law requires hospitals to treat anyone who walks in the door . But today that promise is caught in a collision between money and medicine that is occurring in hospitals all over the country  --  nowhere more than in the elite academic medical centers that have always led the way in training the next generation of doctors , inventing the next generation of cures , and providing them to those who could least afford to pay . <P> When TIME set out to tell the story of what is happening , not just on the front lines but also in the backrooms of American medicine , we sought out the kind of institution best equipped to solve the insoluble problem : a world-class teaching hospital where the same urgency and intellect that is applied to saving lives is assigned nowadays to saving the institution itself . All across the country , teaching hospitals are trying to figure out how to marry progress with profits , how to come up with the money that will let them continue to lead the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . <P> Duke University Medical Center is one of the crown jewels of American medicine . In the labs , wards and classrooms spread out over the 210-acre medical campus in the North Carolina Piedmont , doctors are pushing hard against the limits of our imagination : tiptoeing electronically through the brain in search of hidden tumors , inventing vaccines that might turn lethal cancers into treatable ones , even breeding animals whose organs could one day be harvested for transplant to make up for the shortfall in human donors . These men and women muscled their way through college and medical school and internships and fellowships , just for the chance to work 100-hour weeks , live on hospital food , only rarely find time to see their families or to exercise , and drive cars that are not as fancy as the ones owned by their colleagues down the road at the fancy for-profit hospital . They chose Duke largely because of the scientists here and the work they do ; yet they have come to realize that today their survival depends on decisions being made by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
