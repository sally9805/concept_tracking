<p> Central Bucks East High football coach Larry Greene begins hearing the question nine months before his team 's first day of practice : Will East beat rival Central Bucks West on Thanksgiving Day ? <p> " It 's always the first question . You 've got 12 games ahead of you , but the only thing people want to know is if you can beat West , " said Greene . " But I enjoy it . It 's a great experience for the kids . Unless they go to a Division I program , they 'll never experience a game like this . There 's 10,000 people , extensive media coverage and great tradition . " <p> Thousands of turkey dinners were put on hold Thursday across the USA until high school football games were played - not just in big cities such as Buffalo and San Francisco , but also communities such as Bucks County , Pa. , where traditional rivals clashed before a standing-room-only crowd . <p> One of USA TODAY 's Super 25 teams took the field Thursday in Massachusetts , perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut out Framingham North 37-0 . That game kicked off a weekend in which 22 nationally ranked teams face playoff dates . <p> The National Football League 's Thanksgiving Day games , involving the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys , get the most attention , thanks to national television . But a lot of special memories have been forged while playing high school football on Thanksgiving afternoons . <p> " High school football is a family event in its traditions , much more so than college or pro football , " said Dennis Deninger , producer of ESPN 's Scholastic Sports America , a high school sports program that has broadcast a Thanksgiving football special for four years . This year 's show included highlights from games in 10 states . <p> " Going to the big game and having Thanksgiving dinner is part of what you can do in your hometown with the people you love , " said Deninger . <p> " Everybody knows everybody else - ' That 's my son out there ' - and mom , dad , brother and sister are in the stands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> So it was Thursday in Doylestown , Pa . " This game is these kids ' whole life , " said Nancy Loughery , mother of West senior fullback Jack and sophomore linebacker Mike . " We 're totally reliving it all the time . We do n't want it to end . " <p> The Loughery family went to a relative 's home for Thanksgiving , the first time Nancy has n't hosted the holiday . <p> Does the hype affect the holiday ? <p> " I ca n't imagine not going to a football game on Thanksgiving , " she said . " The most important thing is that it 's a good game . These kids are all winners . " <p> The series , which began in 1969 , was destined to become a classic . When Central Bucks East was completed , Route 611 was designated as the East-West border . " There had been talk of keeping the seniors together , but you ended up with a team that had been playing together since 10th grade suddenly divided , " said West 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " East got all the quarterbacks . We got all the linebackers . " <p> West dominates the series 19-2-1 , but it was East that got its share of national attention in 1988 . West had the nation 's longest winning streak at 53 games . Underdog East missed a last-second field goal in a 14-14 tie that ended West 's streak . <p> Thursday , before a crowd of 10,000 , East appeared headed for only its third victory when quarterback Mike Morelli completed a 70-yard , third- quarter touchdown pass to Sean Lenz . <p> But with 1 : 25 remaining , West fullback Dave Binder scored on a 1-yard run . Down 7-6 , West coach Pettine opted to try for the two-point conversion . Just before West quarterback Greg Moyland was tackled , he found Chris Cleland in the end zone for the 8-7 victory . <p> For the first time in series history , the game was marred by a bench- clearing scuffle with five seconds remaining . <p> " I 'm sorry the game ended that way , " said Pettine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gets me concerned . " <p> Said East coach Greene : " This is the worst I 've ever felt after a game . We had it won . It 's absolutely horrible . This will take a long time to get over . " <p> There was a time when Thanksgiving was a traditional football day for great college football rivalries . But for many schools , such as those in the NCAA 's Division I-AA , II and III and other smaller colleges , playoff schedules make Thanksgiving games impossible . <p> Now , it 's almost exclusively a day for high school rivalries . And in some states , that 's becoming increasingly difficult . Washington state has eliminated its holiday playoff games at the Tacoma Dome . <p> But that has n't stopped rivalries such as the ones in Baltimore ( City vs . Poly , 102 games ) and Boston ( Latin High vs . English High , 104 games ) . New York City rivals Xavier and Fordham Prep first played Nov. 27 , 1886 , and have met for 64 consecutive years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco and Washington , D.C. , city championships were on the line when Thanksgiving games kicked off . <p> Some of the other remaining Thanksgiving football treats from across the USA : <p> - Connecticut : " It 's been a tradition here for 1,000 years , " said Al Cramer , assistant executive director of the state 's high school athletic association , which sanctions holiday games for two-thirds of its 120 member schools . " Kids are home from college , they can all go to the games and see their friends , enjoy the big crowds and be home for lunch at 2 p.m . " ESPN 's coverage highlighted the traditional clash between state rivals Ansonia and Naugatuck . <p> - New Jersey : The 23-year football rivalry between Bridgewater East and Bridgewater West ended Thursday ; the schools will merge next season . " It 's a great day , the only problem is that one side or the other is going to be miserable on the holiday because they lost , " said West coach Tony Maglione . <p> Some New Jersey schools had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playoff schedule . " In many , many places that used to have Thanksgiving games , the playoffs have drastically reduced the number of games played on Thursday , " says ESPN 's Deninger . But that did n't stop Rutgers University scouts from fanning out across New Jersey , as well as into neighboring Pennsylvania and other states . " We 've got some guys on the road who wo n't get their usual Thanksgiving dinners until they get home , " said Scarlet Knights recruiting coordinator Fran Foley . <p> - Missouri : Thursday 's game between host Webster Grover and Kirkland was billed as the oldest continuous high school rivalry west of the Mississippi . The series that began in 1907  --  is still burning bright . <p> " We 're two cities in suburban St. Louis that are side-by-side with railroad tracks running through the middle , " said Kirkland coach Dale Collier . " And this is n't just a one-day event . Two weeks ago the schools had a dance and 1,200 people showed up . A man who went to Webster Grove left a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was last Thursday . And the day before the game , this place is a zoo . " <p> - Maine : The 79th meeting of Portland and Deering wo n't count in the league standings , " but do n't try telling that to the players or the community , " said Portland principal Dana W. Allen . " For an average game , we might have 500 or 600 fans , but on Thanksgiving we 'll have 8,000 or 9,000 . We 've played in all kinds of weather , and it 's a great tradition . " <p> One by-product of the increased attendance , according to Allen : " It helps us make our athletic budget , " important when many high school athletic departments are facing lean times . But not every high school football game played Thursday was laden with tradition . In Alabama , Ariton ( 9-2 ) squared off after dark against Southern Normal ( 5-3 ) in a Class 1A playoff game because that 's the only time the stadium in Brewton , Ala. , was available . <p> " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than on the holiday , " said Ariton coach Julius Head . " Eating Thanksgiving dinner and then going out to play football ... It was n't my idea . " <p> One question remains : Does the turkey and dressing taste any better when you 're a winner ? <p> " You bet that it does , " said Bridgewater West 's Maglione.
