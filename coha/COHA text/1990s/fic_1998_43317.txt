Some aspects of business stay the same through changes in technology . Others get really different ! . <p> " Nobody Cares About Your Teenage Angst , " the parrot said . " Yeah , I think that 's i&gt; probably one of the best songs I ever wrote . " For a guy named Jet , he had to flap his wings a lot to keep airborne . He mostly just sat on one of the three wooden beams in his twelve-foot by twelve-foot room , preened his bright green and blue feathers and complained . That is , except when he had a captive audience . " Me and the boys , we 'd knock the kids out with that one . Rogie 'd start poundin " on the skins and Hash 'd be screamin " on the axe . Betcha don " see nuthin " like that these days . " Jet Black paced up and down on the beam that hung at eye level from the ceiling of his private room at the Marilyn Quayle Aviary and Cryogenic Laboratories . Bill , Jet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved and flapped his wings when he talked . He figured the musician probably used to gesture with his hands when he was in his own body . Bill turned away to dish out bird seed and listened politely as the parrot continued . " Gawd , those lvrics were searin ' . I mean-hey ! What 'd ya think yer doin ' ? " " What ? " Bill asked . The sharp tone in Jet 's voice caught him by surprise . Ms. Chan , his supervisor , had warned Bill that Jet had a bad temper and he had been kind of surly when Ms. Chan introduced them , but Bill thought Jet 's bad mood had been due to the presence of Ms. Chan . Her stern businesslike manners certainly kept Bill on edge . Jet was only Bill 's second bird-person , or " client " as the Aviary people insisted on calling them . The first had been a woman whose clone was just about ready to receive her soul , her " essence " she liked to say , back into it . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back to human form and all . Jet was another story altogether . " Jeezus , look at that . You 're spillin " my special Colombian-grown millet and nuts all over the freakin " floor , you moron . " Jet screeched and shook his feathers in irritation . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Black , " Bill said , " I 'll clean it up . " " I 'm sorry , " Jet mocked . Bill was amazed at how much sarcasm the guy could fit into a parrot 's voice . " I 'll say you 're sorry . You obviously do n't know how much that stuff costs . And now it 's in the carpet , so you 'll have to vacuum and I freakin " HATE the vacuum . " Jet 's feathers were completely ruffled and his clawed toes were working back and forth on the beam , wearing splinters free . " I 'll take care of the carpet when you go for your afternoon exercises , " Bill said , trying to placate the angry bird . " Fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freakin exercises . I hate this whole freakin " place ! And I hate being a freakin " bird ! " zI bet you do , but you wo n't be a parrot forever . I 'm sure your clone 'll be ready for you soon . " Bill knew that talking about a person 's clone made most clients happy . It was like talking about an upcoming vacation . This was n't the case with Jet though , and Bill immediately regretted bringing it up . Jet flapped his wings wildly and started squawking and hopping from one foot to the other . Most of what Bill could make out of the noise were swear words . Then Jet flew from one beam to another , squawking louder now and dropping feathers . Bill started talking to the bird in soft , calm tones . He moved deliberately to the wall with the control panel and slowly dimmed the lights and dropped the window blinds . " Shhhh , pretty bird , pretty bird , pretty bird , " he cooed , over and over hoping to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work because Jet landed on a high shelf , panting a little from the exertion . " Do n't you pretty bird " me ! " Jet muttered . By now Bill had the lights as dim as they could go without turning them off . Jet settled in and started preening . " Hey , Mr. Black , I 'm sorry . I did n't mean anything by it , " Bill said . " " I apologize . I 'll leave you for a while , okay ? Anything I can do for you before I go ? " Jet did n't say anything . He warily eyed Bill and bit at the edge of the shelf . " Okay , then , here 's your food . I 'll be back later , and I 'll tell the director that you wo n't need an exercise session today . " As Bill closed the door to Jet 's room , he heard Jet 's parrot voice say , " Yeah , right . Tell the old biddy " e 's shagged out after a long squawk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to his long-time girlfriend and buddy , Diane . " Thanks for meeting me for dinner , such as it is . " " No prob . I got ta eat too . " She paid for her fast food tacos and slipped her wallet into the back pocket of her roomy pants . They took their trays to a quiet booth way back in the corner of the Taco Shak . They sat down opposite each other on the hard benches and Diane tucked her wavy shoulder-length brown hair behind her ears . " So what happened ? " Diane unwrapped her first taco and dribbled hot sauce into it . " Hmmmm ? " " You said it 'd been a long day . Why ? " " Well , first off , Mrs. Legerski 's clone matured enough for soul transfer today . So I lost her as a client . " " Bummer . I know you enjoyed her company . " She wiped a bit of hot sauce away from the corner of her mouth . " Does this mean you 're not getting paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caretakers just get assigned to a new client when they lose the old ones . " He chewed his burrito thoughtfully . " So , are you going to learn how to do soul transfers ? " she asked . " Your guess is as good as mine . I guess if I can stay with the place long enough and take a few courses , I can eventually make it to transfer tech . " Bill took another bite out of his burrito . " I do n't know , those big birds make me edgy . I think I 'd rather be transferred into a cat or something . " " Yeah , you could do that . Almost any animal will do , but you 'd have a harder time communicating what you wanted . And the smaller the animal , the more compressed the information that makes you who you are has to be . " Bill wiped his fingers on a napkin . " Compressed ? Like a computer program ? " " Something like . All the memories and knowledge and emotions and stuff that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downloaded into the host animal . At least , that 's how the transfer techs explained it to me at lunch the other day . " " I guess I get it . But what did you mean by if I can stay with the place long enough , ? What happened today ? " " This caretaking stuff is getting to me I guess . " " Come on , you seemed to like it when you started . " " Yeah . I guess it 's just a little easier when you 're taking care of a petite little cockatiel whose soulmate is getting a new body any day now . " Bill took a long pull off his cola . " Easier than taking care of a large , wicked parrot who has a bitter old rock musician in him . " " Sure it is , " Diane said . She 'd started in on her second taco when what Bill had said sunk in . " Rock musician ? " " Yeah . " " Anybody I 'd know ? " Bill knew how important rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd know who Jet Black was , even though Bill did n't . " Probably , " he answered . " Well , who is it ? " She was leaning over the table so far that her shirt hung open at the neck . Bill enjoyed the unobstructed view of her cleavage . " Diane , I ca n't tell you that . " " Why not ? " " It 's called Patient Confidentiality . " This is sensitive patient information that I ca n't reveal to anyone else , " he nearly quoted it verbatim from the Aviary regulation book . " But you told me who your last client was : Mrs. Legerski ! " " Yes , and Mrs. Legerski had it announced in all the tabs both when she went into the Aviary and now that she 's out . She wanted people to know . This one does n't . Understand ? " " Well , yeah . " Diane sat back up and finished her taco . " So , what happened with the rock guy ? " " Oh , not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw a fit , started flying all around the room and screaming at me . After I calmed him down and left his room , Ms. Chan met me in the hallway . No doubt everyone in the wing heard the commotion . I was afraid I 'd lose this job , too . Anyway , she asked what happened and I told her . " He slurped the last of his cola . " And ? " " And she told me I did the rigiht thing , just like they trained me to do . She was real nice about it . Apologized for assigned me to the guy . Said he goes through cartakers " like parakets go through newspaper . ' " He laughed and added , " I 'll probably be yesterday 's news tomorrow . " " Kind of abusive , is he ? " " Oh , well . Maybe just temperamental . " " Here , let me refill your drink . " Diane took their cups to the fountain . When she returned , Bill asked , " So how as your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " Oh ? " " Yeah , heard back from the latest label . They are n't interested in the demo either . " " Well , then , send it out to the next label on the list . " " They were the last label on the list . " " Oh , " Bill said . " So now what ? " " Well , I guess it 's back to the studio . Except I do n't have enough material for a new demo yet . " She sighed and fiddled with the edge of her napkin . " So , Bill , , " she said , not looking up from the napkin , " Do you think your rocker parrot would listen to the demo cube ? " " What ? " Bill jerked his head up . He nearly choked on his drink . " Why ? " " Well , if he heard the demo , maybe he could , well , kinda maybe sponsor the band , or . . . or even just give a critique or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement . Bill knew what was going on . Diane was building herself up , but he was afraid this was leading to bad news . " Diane , I ca n't do that . This person is n't someone you want to deal with . I do n't want to deal with him as a client ! " " Oh , come on , Bill , " she said , " Please ? " He hated it when she begged like that , because it was so easy to give in . He had to be firm on this . " No , Diane . Trust me , you do n't want to have anything to do with him . Besides , " he said , " I may not be working with him after today . " He hoped . " Oh , okay , " she sighed . " It was a stupid idea anyway . " " So , what are you doing tonight ? " Bill asked after a moment of silence . She shrugged . " Do n't know , no plans . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max , " he said , and then added enticingly , " It 's got Neil Fillmore in it . " She looked at him , a smile gradually growing on her face . " Yeah ? And how 're we going to get there ? " " Hey , I got paid today . We can take the line down and back . My treat . " He was smiling now , too . " So how 're you going to pay for that shiny new mag transport if you blow your paycheck on holos and the line ? " she asked . " Just so happens I 've been saving between a third and a half of each paycheck since I started this job . Just do n't expect holos every night . " " Neil Fillmore , huh ? Okay , you 're on . " She smiled and together they headed for the line stop . The next day Bill was surprised to see that he was still assigned to Jet Black . He 'd been sure the incident the day before would get him transferred at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast , then spent the rest of the morning cleaning the windows in Jet 's room . Bill did n't speak much , except for the polite " Good morning " and " Let me know what I can do for you . " Jet ate at his breakfast without answering . He spent the morning chewing on his cuttlebone , and watching Bill go about his duties . Jet was sitting on a parrot swing in front of a full-size poster of his former body when Bill came back from his lunch break . It was one of many posters tacked up around the room . Most of them had been around from the rocker 's first heyday , or so Bill figured . This one was made of a plasticized paper and had been rolled and unrolled many times . One corner was torn off and another close to it . " So , hey , uh-whats-yer-name , Phil ? Jet asked . " Bill . " Bill picked up a few feathers that Jet had shed in his fit yesterday . He turned to face him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craning his little green head around to look at Bill . Keeping eye contact , Jet stepped around on his swing so that his whole body faced him . " Say , uh , do me a favor , would va ? " Bill hesitated only a moment , then said , " Sure . What can I do ? " " Well , uh , would ya mind playing some music for me ? I got a bunch of CDs over there by the player . " Jet flew over to the ancient CD player . Bill walked over and saw the collection of music , some of it classical , dating back to the " 60s and " 70s . There were a lot of names he 'd never heard of before . By far , though , the majority of the CDs were by Blitzkrieg , the F-15s and Stealth . These were all Jet 's bands from his years as a working musician . He had some solo stuff too . A small memcube player sat beside the CD player , but there were far fewer cubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear ? " Bill asked . " Ya know how ya get a certain song stuck in yet head and ya just got ta hear it or ya 'll go bonkers ? Huh ? " " Yeah , I know how it is , " Bill nodded . " Yeah , well , I got ta hear this one . " Jet reached up with his beak , and tugged at a CD from the Blitzkrieg section . Bill pulled it out of the rack and read the title . " Necrotic Nuisance ? " " That 's the one . It went Uranium five times . " Jet cocked his head to the right in appreciation . Bill tried studying the CD player to figure out how it worked , but Jet shot orders at him too fast . " On-button is there , lower left . Push the open/close button , just once . There , now put the disk in-NO NO ! - Writing side up ! Yeah , right . Now the open/close button again . Good . I really just wanted to hear one song . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the display reads five . Right . Jeez , I need to get a system set up so I can do this . Shit . I just need to get a real body . Shit . Okay , now hit memory , then the play-button . That 's the one with the single right hand arrow okay ? " Bill smiled to himself and complied with all of Jet 's directions . The room filled with the sound of loud distorted guitars and machine-gun-fire drumming . It pounded its way to the very core of Bill 's body , and he wondered if Jet , being so much smaller , felt it even more intensely . Bill worried briefly about the volume , but decided not to turn it down unless told to . It seemed right to be this loud . Screaming vocals bounced eerily around them , first from the left , then behind , somehow jumping to the opposite corner , finally dopplering from below past their heads toward the infinity of up . Even though Bill could n't have heard it , he was certain that Jet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopping around on one leg then the other . The song ended and the resulting quiet was almost as deafening as the music had been . After a moment of profound ecstasy , Bill turned to Jet and said , " Wow ! That was great ! " Jet ducked his head a little and said , " Thanks . " After another moment , he said , " Uh , you can put somethin " else on if you want . Just do n't play anythin " real crappy , okay ? " " Okay , " Bill said then wondered just what the guy 's definition of crappy was . He played it safe , and started Necrotic Nuisance over from the beginning . Even after Jet 's attempt at peacemaking , Bill wondered each morning if he 'd still have a job serving Jet Black . He was never sure if he could get through an hour without calling down the wrath of the old rocker . Sometimes Jet would lash out at Bill for no apparent reason at all . Other times , he seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push Bill 's buttons and start an argument merely for the sake of arguing . Yet there were whole days when the parrot would be eager just to have Bill 's company . He 'd ask Bill about all the things any young adult male human would be interested in . Even then , though , Jet had strong opinions and one of his strongest opinions was that everyone should know what Jet 's opinions were . " So you 're saving to buy yourself a mag , " Jet said one sunny afternoon . " Have you looked at a bunch ? " " Well , yeah , Bill said , uI have my eye on- " " No , wait . Let me guess , " he said . " You want a Penex 1000 , Candy Apple Red with all the latest laser trim and a friggin " top-of-the-line holo memcube player . " Cept you 'd probably play that twink crap that passes fer music now . Never mind that , Billyboy , I think the Penex is the mag fer you . " " Actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Flash ? Are you friggin " crazy ? They 're nowhere , kid . " " Hey , they are n't that bad . Besides , I figure I can afford the down payment for one by next summer , " Bill said , a defensive edge creeping into his voice . " Yeah , sure . Ya might be able to afford a Flash , but deep down , do n't ya really want a Penex ? They 're fast , they 're powerful , and fems fall all over themselves ta ride in one . " " I ca n't argue about that , but I still ca n't afford one , and right now , I 've just got to be realistic . " " Look , kid , I 'm not sayin " yer wrong . Sometimes ya got ta be realistic . Maybe if I'da been more realistic I would n't be in this mess . But I am sayin " do n't be denyin " yerself the pleasure of wantin " somethin " all the way . " " Okay , " Bill said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jet squawked once and ruffled his feathers . Uh-oh , Bill thought , now what ? " Whadya mean , what kinda mag do I have ? Does it look like I have a mag ? What the hell do ya think I 'd do with a mag ? I 'm a freakin " bird ! I ca n't reach the pedals fer chrissakes ! An " ferget about gettin a license Awwkk ! An " where 'd I go ? Aw hell , man . " This turned out to be one of Jet 's milder explosions . He did n't even leave the beam he 'd been perched on . It still left Bill a little unsettled , though . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Black . I guess I thought that you 'd have one in storage , " Bill apologized . " I.et 's get one thing straight here , " Jet said . He flicked his wings to unruffle his feathers and walked to the end of the beam closest to Bill . " The only thing I have in storage is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real mobius strip because I need enough money ta get a clone , but I need the clone fer the tour ta make the money . Or I need the doofuses at the research labs to find a cure for my original body . Ai n't nobody 's gon na pay ta hear a parrot sing . In the meantime , here I sit . Molting . " " I thought you guys sounded pretty good tonight , " Bill said . He sat with Diane on her couch , sharing a pint of strawberry swirl ice cream with her . " Hmm , it was okay , I guess , " she said . She dipped her spoon into the carton and dug out a frozen berry . " Thanks for the ice cream . It gets hot up on stage . " She stuck the berry , spoon and all , into her mouth , then held the spoon with her lips while she pulled her damp hair away from her neck . " You 're welcome , " Bill said . " You do n't sound very up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off tonight . She kept rushing the beat , like she had somewhere eLse to go . " Bill licked his spoon clean and said , " My client said he had the worst time trying to find a drummer who did n't do that . He said it 's like they 're all in a big race or something . " " You seem to be getting along pretty well with your client these days , " she said . " What 's it been , three weeks now ? " " Yeah , I guess it has . " " Not bad for someone who was sure he would n't last another day with the guy . " She waited for her turn at the ice cream . " What did you think of the last song we did ? " " The new one ? Pretty good . It 'll be a knockout once you guys get the chord progressions down . " Bill knew right away that he 'd blown it . Every time Diane gave him that look-the one where she stared at him , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in trouble . " Oh , great , " she said at last , her meaning clear that it was n't great . " The chord progressions are the only thing right with that song . I 'm never going to get enough new material for another demo at this rate . I may have to resort to doing a cover of Free Bird ' , " she snorted in disgust . " Come on , Diane . I 'm not a musician ; what do I know about chord progressions ? " Bill did n't want this evening to go sour . Diane worked hard to get her band out of the garage and into the studio , but her ego had taken a hit with this last rejection . She 'd been pretty glum lately . " Well , you know enough to know what I already knew , too . That song is n't right , for whatever reason . " She scraped the last of the ice cream out of the carton and licked the spoon clean . " I just wish there was someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while we work on more songs . " " I wish I could help you , " Bill said . " Yeah , me too . " They sat in silence for a while , staring at the empty ice cream carton . " Billy , " Diane said , her voice soft . " Yeah ? " You said your client has a memcube player- " " No way , Diane ! " Bill sat up straight . " Aww , come on . You said he sometimes lets you pick the music to play . " " No ! " She looked at him and blinked her long eyelashes at him . " Please ? " " Aww jeez ! Bill ! What the friggin " hell ya tryin " ta do ta me ! " Jet flapped his wings furiously at the memcube player . " Bill ! Turn this drivel off ! Now ! Damn it . Aaawwkkk ! " " Shhh , hold on . " Bill had been afraid of this . He still could n't believe that he 'd let Diane talk him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to push Jet out of his way enough to turn off the player . He took the clear crystalline cube out and was going to pocket it , but before he could , Jet flew past and caught it in his beak . With more grace than Bill could imagine , Jet landed on a shelf on the opposite side of the room and set the memcube between his feet . " We need to talk , " Jet said . Bill felt like Jet had bored a hole all the way through his head with those parrot eyes of his . There 'd be no excuses here . Bill turned to face him straight on . " Okay . " What else could he say ? " Where 'd ya get this ? " Jet asked . He rolled the cube between his toes . " It 's not mine . It belongs to a friend . " " Your girlfriend , huh ? " This took Bill by surprise . " How 'd you know ? " " Hey , hey , hey . I 'm askin " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . " " It 's her first demo , but she 's working on another . " " Yes . " " Jeez , ya stopped the player just in time . She probably does some stinkin " cover of Free Bird , and I really freakin " hate that song , now more than ever , " Jet muttered . He turned back to Bill . " So ya offered ta take it ta good ol " Jet Black . He 's a rocker . I 'll bet he 's got lotsa connections , yeah . An " he 's got nuthin " better ta do than scout out new bands . I 'll just do ol " Jet Black a favor an " let him discover my girlfriend 's band . " Well let me tell ya this , Billyboy , I ai n't gon na discover yer squeeze 's freakin " band cuz I ca n't do a freakin " thing about it . Damn , I ca n't even get my own songs recorded . I 've got ten CDs worth of songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do a damn thing about her band even if I thought they had a friggin " chance . " Jet picked up the memcube in his beak again and with one quick bite , shattered it . Spitting the pieces out , he said , " That 's what I think of yer girlfriend 's friggin " demo . " Bill and Jet stared at each other for a long moment . Bill turned away and headed for the hall . " Where ya goin ' ? " Jet asked . " To clean up the mess . It 's in the carpet , now , so I 'll have to vacuum . " " Aww , Jeezus . . Hey ! Leave it until my freakin " afternoon exercises , would ya ? Aaawwwk ! Oh , shit ! " " He crushed my demo ? " Diane asked . Bill could tell she was hoping he was teasing her . In answer , he handed her the sandwich bag with the shards of the memcube in it . Then he leaned against the refrigerator in her tiny apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tell Diane that Jet said the same thing about it . Who does this jerk think he is ? " She was somewhere between mad and crying . Bill had n't seen her this upset in years . Not since their sixth grade teacher found Diane 's love letter to Danny Greenbaum and decided to read it aloud to the class , complete with lyrics from a Rhesus Monkey song . " Diane , I 'm so sorry , " Bill said . " Bill , " she said , tears rimming her eyes , " now what am I going to do ? " " Come on , Diane . You said everybody , ' d already heard this demo . Chalk it up to practice and you and the gang go in and make the next one . " " You make it sound so easy , " she said between snuffles . " Do n't you think I 've been trying ? We need new material , and I 'm the only one who really knows how to orchestrate . And , and . . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning red . Bill grabbed a tissue for her . It made him feel a little less useless . She quickly dabbed at her eyes and blew her nose and snuffled once more before she continued . " And even if we did have more songs to record , the demo studio costs money and Frank does n't work there anymore . Did I tell you he got fired ? And so he ca n't get us discounts anymore or barter his time , and and and . . . hic and bic ula . hhhhhhhh . " Bill had never seen Diane lose it like this ! Crying herself to hiccups . He cradled her in his arms , her face buried in his chest , and he cooed softly . " Shhhh , now , it 's okay . It 's okay , " he said . The fresh smell of her hair was starting to intoxicate him . " No , it 's not okay , " she said . Most of her words were muffled in his shirt , but he knew what she 'd said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nice . " Sure it is . We 'll think of something . " " Oh , Bill , I do n't know what . " " I 'm sorry , Di . I shoulda known old Jet would do something rude like- " " What ? " Diane asked suddenly . She pulled back from Bill and somehow her tears dried up , though her face was still red and her eyes a little puffy . " What ? " Bill asked . " O my God ! I ca n't believe it ! " " What ! ? " " Your mystery client is Jet Black , is n't it ! No , no . Do n't tell me . I do n't want you to break your confident patient thing . God ! " Diane stood back from Bill a little , and gave him an embarrassed smile . Then she turned away , blew her nose and touched the wreckage of her memcube with wonder . " Bill ! Jet Black crushed my demo ! I thought he was dead ! " Her eyes were shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the strain . " Do n't you get it , Bill ? " Her bright eyes looked up at him , searching his face for a clue that he did get it . But he had no clue to give her . " You 've been slacking on your rock history , man . Do n't you know just who it is you 're dealing with ? Jet Black , hardrocking , hard-living , hard-to-live-with leader of the F-15s and Stealth " Do n't forget Blitzkreig , " he added . " Yes , Blitzkreig . Jet Black is this century 's Mozart . A genius who walks the fine line of sanity . " " I have heard some his work . It 's good . " " Good ? It 's wonderful . Brilliant . Words ca n't describe his music . Bill ! You 're taking care of a legend ! " " Great , " he said without enthusiasm . " It was hard enough to deal with your basic musician . Now he 's legend . " " Get with it , Bill . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . " She sat down on the couch . " So how 'd he supposedly die ? " Bill sat down beside her . " For a long time , everyone thought he 'd died the way most rockers do . Overdose or something related , " she paused to blow her nose , " but then someone from the F-15s let it slip that he was diagnosed with myelonecrotic hypersomethingorother . Whatever it was , it was incurable and fatal and he supposedly died from it . " " But he did n't ! At least his soul , or whatever you want to call it , did n't , " Bill said . " He 's sitting in a parrot body as we speak , down at the aviary . She hugged herself tightly . al ca n't believe it ! " " Believe it , " Bill said . " So how long ago did he , uh , die ? " " Oh , let me think . It must 've been at least twenty-five years ago . " " Yeesch . No wonder he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time . " " Why does n't he just get a clone made ? " " He has his reasons . " Diane asked , " Oh ? " hoping for more explanation . " Patient confidentiality , again , " he said . " I do n't want to make this any more complicated than it already is . But you can fill me in on him , ca n't you ? " " I can tell you about his albums , awards , lawsuits , lovers . Whatever you want . " " Lovers ? " " Oh yes ! Especially zz.min- " " How about a cup of tea or something and you can catch me up on my Jet Black history . " " Sure . Want a dry shirt while we talk ? I 'm afraid I got yours all soggy . Bill looked down at his shirt . " Well , okay . " " Hey Jet , " Bill said , " what do you want more than anything else ? " " Do n't be toyin " with me , kid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else . " Jet was biting at a string of crystals that glittered in the sun . " Yeah , I know , " Bill said . " You want out of the parrot body . How 're you going to do it ? " I 'm warning ya , leave it alone . " Jet 's tone of voice went from being simply annoyed to threatening . " I 'm serious , Jet . think I know what to do . I know we ca n't get your original body cured yet , but I- " " Aawwwk ! What 're ya friggin " talkin " about , Bill ? ! " " Hear me out . Just because Jazzmin- " Stop ! Do n't be sayin " her name around here- " " Jazzmin ? Your ex ? " Jet started squawking and screaming and shouting " Stop it ! " at the most furious rate Bill had seen yet . He 'd expected to get some kind of reaction out of Jet by mentioning his ex-lover 's name but this was far better than he 'd expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . Bill kept egging him on , calling out Jazzmin 's name , until Jet had littered the floor with green and blue feathers . Jet tried dive-bombing Bill and snapping at his ears with his beak . He beat at Bill with his wings , and then Bill brought out the heavy artillery : the vacuum cleaner . One flick of the switch and the vacuum roared to life . Bill heard Jet 's piercing NO " above the din . Jet retreated to a dark corner shelf , trembling with exertion . Bill took a couple of quick runs on the carpet while he had the vacuum going , just for good measure , then flicked it off . Jet was quiet now and Bill noticed that he looked like a feather duster that the cat had played with too long . He tucked his head under his wing and muttered , " Go away . " Bill felt almost as exhausted as Jet looked . It was a big chance he was taking and it could cost him his job . He dimmed the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this is the only way I knew you 'd hear me out . You 're too tired to object . " There was a knock at the door . Bill opened it just a crack to see Ms. Chan on the other side , concern written all over her face . " What is happening in there ? " she asked in a harsh whisper . " It 's okay , Ms. Chan . I have everything under control . " Yeah , right . " You better . Some of our other clients are very upset by the racket coming out of there . If I hear any more commotion out of there like that , I may have to find someone else to look after Mr. Black . Heaven help us . She closed the door . " You hear her , Jet ? " Bill asked . " We may have lost me my job . But I still want you to hear me out . " " Like I seem ta have a choice , " Jet said . His trembling was less violent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This is her ? " Jet gave Diane the once over , flapping from one perch to another to get a full view of her . " Look , sweetie , no offense , but you just ai n't the picture of success . Not in rock . " Diane 's eyes grew huge and her mouth dropped , but she recovered quickly . " You have n't even heard me yet ! " she said . " Yeah , and I do n't have ta . You got ta drop five to ten pounds right off , or move " em up from yer lower half ta yer uppa half , if ya get my drift . Look , I know what I 'm takin " about . " " Okay , five to ten pounds off , not up , " Diane said defiantly . " And what 's with the hair ? What , the cocker spaniel look is in ? I think not ! Awk , I mean , aw hell . We 'll deal with that later . So sweetie , let 's hear yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew she was nervous , but didi n't realize how bad until he noticed how white her knuckles were as she gripped her guitar . With a deep breath , sh switched on her amp and let loose with the best she had . Jet sat silently through the audition then announced his verdict . " What the hell do ya call that ? A song ? You do n't know the difference between a bar and a bridge , a coda from a coma and if ya play that kinda crap to an audience that 's what they 'll be in , a coma ! Jeezus , and those lyrics ! I hardly dare call " em that ! Who in the world told ya you could write a song ! Jet paced back and forth during this diatribe , flapping his wings as he went . Bill watched the whole scene from the corner of the room , holding his breath as though that could give Diane the extra support she needed . He could see she was trembling . " But ! " Jet cackled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so ? " Diane asked . " Hey , I 'm talkin " here , " Jet said . The room went instantly silent and Diana 's lips were clamped shut , with a subtle hint of a smile playing at the corners of her mouth . He laughed , a squeaky kind of sound , and continued , " - and in time I think we can work on yer guitar technique . Between the two of us we may have a chance . " Diane 's eyes were wide and her smile even wider . " Bill ! Did you hear that ? " she laughed . " He said my voice is passable ! Jet Black said that about me ! " Bill smiled . " Yes , I heard . " " Here 's the deal , " Jet said , " My songs , your voice . A first album 's always sorta risky , but we can split the take sixtyforty . Since it 's my songs and my connections , I get the sixty . Of course , anything left over from paying off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , Bill ? " " Huh ? " Bill asked . " Headhunter 's fee ? " The conversation was streaking right past him now . " Sure thing . Should be enough ta pay fer that Candy Apple Penex , doncha thinkk ? " " What ? Now wait a minute  --  " Diane shot him a questioning look that plainly said , Since when hav eyou wanted a Penex ? Bill shrugged back . Jet did n't notice this exchange . " Aw , Jeez , " he said , " if we 're gon na haggle , yer gon na have ta break out my special Columbian , man . " " I't not  --  " " The Colombian ? " the parrot demanded . Mystified , BIll got the bag of seed and poured a handful into Jet 's feeder . " All right ? " he asked . " Perfect , " Jet said , " Gawd , I love talking business over lunch . " No new findings will ever be made if we rest content with the findings of the past . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find anything , he is not even looking . " But surely you are going to walk in your predecessors " footsteps ? " Yes indeed , I shall use the old road , but if I find a shorter and easier one I shall open it up . The men who pioneered the old routes are leaders , not our masters . Truth lies open to everyone . There has yet to be a monopoly of truth . And there is plenty of it left for future generations too . - Seneca ( 4 BC - AD 65 ) ( Submitted by Ted Truscoe )
