<p> When first lady Jacqueline Kennedy showed off the newly polished White House to television cameras back in 1962 , her tour was described as " the greatest sightseeing trip in history . " A new account of the restoration suggests it was a tour de force of diplomacy . <p> The star of an era when first ladies could be taste makers without risking feminist backlash , Jackie emerges in a new book as power broker , balancing clashing styles and interests to create a backdrop worthy of a Camelot presidency . " Designing Camelot : The Kennedy White House Restoration " ( Van Nostrand Reinhold , $ 50 ) is the work of James A. Abbott , 33 , curator of decorative arts at Baltimore Museum of Art , and Elaine M. Rice , 29 , a consultant in Wilmington , Del . Turning graduate research into a hardcover book , Abbott delved into decorator archives , finding some Kennedy correspondence . Rice read the letters of Winterthur Museum founder Henry Francis du Pont . A titan among collectors , du Pont became key fund-raiser for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had rejected his tastes . <p> Today at the National Archives , the authors will lecture after a replay of the TV tour . From Red to Blue to Green , East Room to State Dining Room , first floor to private quarters , they will show how all were central to the public perception of glamour in the Kennedy era . <p> Few administrations have glittered with equal elegance . But each presidential family leaves a stamp on the White House . For instance , the Clintons have introduced crafts . And although Hillary Rodham Clinton has not staked her reputation on decor , green silk going up over historic scenic wallpaper in the family dining room will be judged as on her watch , as will the one-inch gilded balls being added to the upstairs living room ceiling . <p> The Kennedys moved into a White House full of B. Altman department store furniture purchased by the Trumans . Jacqueline Kennedy was determined to leave behind a museum reflecting the 33 families who had lived there . By the time of her TV tour , she was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government storehouses . At her urging , Americans dug into attics and pocketbooks turning up an avalanche of furnishings . By early 1963 , the White House had gathered $ 232,436 in cash , plus 350 gifts of furnishings . The restoration generated national interest , sent prices for antiques soaring and inspired work on governors ' mansions . <p> " Mrs. Kennedy at the White House greatly popularized historical houses and collecting antiques , interesting people in American history , " says William Seale , historian of the White House . But the rooms were first and foremost " settings for politics and ceremony . " <p> " Designing Camelot " is not a book of revelations . But its polite , **28;84;TOOLONG approach will engage those who understand how decor reveals personality . Decorative historians Abbott and Rice figuratively sifted paint chips and fabric swatches and came up with at least one surprise : John F. Kennedy was very involved with the decoration , not only of the Oval Office , which was never completed , but also the family quarters . " He had very strong opinions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great sense of color . <p> To sell such a major decorative project , the first lady adopted the loftier notion of restoration . By enlisting knowledgeable individuals , she assured the seriousness of the endeavor . But experts came with strong wills , and she had to navigate around them . <p> " Mrs. Kennedy was very savvy , " says Rice . " She juggled a lot of personalities keeping everyone happy . " <p> The cast of well-known characters included Sister Parish , an American society decorator ; Stephane Boudin , a prominent aristocratic French decorator ; du Pont , the scholarly collector of Americana ; and Jayne Wrightsman , a collector of French 18th-century antiques who became Kennedy 's mentor . Wrightsman alone survives . <p> In the book , Parish emerges as an anglophile interior designer more valuable for her connections to the fabric house of Scalamandre than for her way with a window treatment . The Kennedys ' personal decorator , she set out to re-create the coziness of their Georgetown house . But accounts of the Yellow Oval Room show how she lost ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly by the first lady , who needed her network of clients as donors . Parish was mollified with a first-floor dining room to decorate . <p> For his part , Franco Scalamandre had two scrapes with the first lady . An early attempt to weave an eagle for the Blue Room chairs was derided by her curator as looking " more like a plucked chicken . " He improved on the design , but then made the mistake of talking to the press . Kennedy switched to a French source , cutting him out . To avoid any political fallout , the fabric was imported indirectly . <p> Wrightsman , a Palm Beach neighbor , had identified the young wife of Sen. Kennedy as a potential first lady and proceeded to teach her what she did n't know . Wrightsman and husband , Charles , became major donors and paid for the Blue Room . Wrightsman also engineered the participation of du Pont as head of a formal restoration committee . <p> Du Pont , who had turned his peerless trove of American decorative arts  --  89,000 objects  --  into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed ideas about period settings had supporters . But Kennedy opted for style over historical correctness . <p> The book recounts how du Pont would visit the White House and command rearrangement of furniture . After his departure , Kennedy would have it moved back again . " He knew he needed to put a good face on all of this , " says Rice . <p> Born a Bouvier , the first lady had France in her genes . So it made sense that the last player to emerge from behind the curtain  --  and most important  --  was Boudin , from the Paris firm of Jansen . He had worked for the shah of Iran , the duke and duchess of Windsor and the Wrightsmans . Described as modest and immensely talented , he did not hesitate to dismiss a ruffled Parish tablecloth as looking " like a fat Spanish dancer . " Neither scholar nor historian , he had chilly relations with du Pont . <p> Boudin used historical elements to create rooms of great presence and beauty . " The French have that way of dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up with something fresh , " says Seale . <p> Nowhere was that more evident than in the Blue Room . The first lady described the finished work as " Boudin 's masterpiece . " Du Pont was appalled . <p> Seeking a buffer between the heavy Red and Green rooms , Boudin dispensed with bold blue walls . He designed a striped white-on-white tented effect reminiscent of Napoleon 's Malmaison . He saved blue  --  a brilliant sky blue  --  for upholstery and a valance circling the room below the cornice . An early 19th-century Savonnerie in pink , blue and gold covered the floor . A French Empire crystal and gilt-bronze chandelier hung overhead . With James Monroe 's 1817 gilded furnishings , it was as formal a reception room as one could find in a European palace . <p> More importantly , it reflected the " sense of state , ceremony , arrival , and grandeur " that Kennedy was seeking for what become known as Camelot . The often poignant photographs , many from the day of the assassinated President 's funeral , were chosen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first lady receives heads of state . " No photo better represents the Kennedy restoration , " says Abbott . " She is using the first restored room as the last image . " <p> Like Camelot , the fragile silks did not last long . Soiled and shabby by early 1969 , they needed replacement . And traditionalists were complaining about chartreuse in the Green Room , fuchsia in the Red Room , and a Blue Room not in blue , but white . Within months of her arrival , Pat Nixon was shopping at Scalamandre . " Certainly anyone that comes in will bring a certain style , " says Rice . " Most importantly , the White House is used ; it is not a museum . " <p> Looking anew through the trained eyes of Abbott and Rice , it is easy to see the Kennedy restoration 's theatrical quality . That was Boudin 's essential gift . Rather than creating a showcase for individual antiques , he made treasures recede into the overall showcase for the Kennedys . " It was a setting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Gaulle , " says Seale . <p> Among lasting legacies , the White House gained a curator , a fund-raising guide book and a committee to preserve the interiors . Somewhat ironically , Kennedy 's attempt to showcase a continuum of history gave way to a philosophy more in keeping with du Pont 's . As curator for the Nixons , Clement Conger moved the collecting focus back to the period of Monroe , where Kennedy started . <p> Only the Queen 's Sitting Room continues to reflect the decor of Jackie Kennedy , but Abbott thinks " it 's still breathing . " He considers the 1995 redecoration of the Blue Room " a direct tribute to Boudin . " <p> The book takes note of a determination to avoid anything contemporary . " Someone might argue that Americans are always hung up about their history because they have such a short history , " says Lisa Podos of Bard Graduate Center for Decorative Arts in New York . " Certainly Jackie Kennedy was very conservative ; that 's how she was brought up . But remember that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was new was too new . " <p> Notions of what is historic and stately do evolve . Rice was willing to take the long view : " Eventually , " she says , " there 'll be a B. Altman period room in the White House .
