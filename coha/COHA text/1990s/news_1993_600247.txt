<p> Call them thugs , muggers , hit men or whatever , but the Knicks ' brand of Big Apple basketball has put them in prime position to become the next National Basketball Association champions . <p> Of course , the defending champion Chicago Bulls , league-leading Phoenix Suns and a few other teams might have something to say about that , but the Knicks are indeed serious contenders . They 're confident yet cautious , and ever so serious . <p> " We 're starting to get an arrogance , " says Doc Rivers , the veteran point guard who came to the Knicks this season with a reputation for being one of the NBA 's finer gentlemen . But he since has been kicked out of two games and suspended for two more . <p> " We 'd like to be arrogant , but we ca n't because we have n't won anything yet , " Rivers says . " We 'd like to have that Chicago Bulls arrogance , but they won two championships . They earned their arrogance . For now , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . A Cleveland newspaper announced their arrival earlier this season with the headline , " Muggers Here Tonight . " <p> Nearly every team in the league has complained about the way the Knicks play , several taking their complaints directly to the league office . Do you think the Knicks care ? <p> " You ca n't pay too much attention to it , " says Knicks President Dave Checketts . " I do n't . All the complaints about us being dirty and too physical have been fed by coaches and general managers trying to get an edge . After the Chicago series last season , one called me to complain about how dirty Charles Oakley and Anthony Mason were . A month later , the same GM called again and wanted to know if either was available . " <p> How does a team get a reputation like the one the Knicks have , and how is it perpetuated ? <p> To begin with , a team has to be good . The Knicks fit that bill . They have been one of the top three teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the best record in the Eastern Conference . <p> Four incidents above all others convinced observers and opponents the Knicks are bad actors : <p> Early in the season , in a game against the Clippers in Los Angeles , John Starks was in the face of former Knicks guard Mark Jackson , now a Clipper , all game , pointing , jawing , talking trash . Teammates Greg Anthony and Mason were also a bit out of hand with their unsportsmanlike behavior . Coach Pat Riley did n't like what he saw and immediately benched all three . <p> Later in the season , Starks - a gutsy former CBA player - knocked New Jersey 's Kenny Anderson to the floor , breaking Anderson 's wrist and ending his season and whatever title hopes the Nets had . Starks was assessed a flagrant foul and later apologized , but the reputation was growing . <p> In a showdown with the Suns in Phoenix last month , a bench-clearing brawl broke out that resulted the suspension of three players and the assessment of fines totaling more than $ 250,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 50,000 for what the league called failure to control their players . The Suns were fined $ 25,000 . <p> In Miami , 10 days after the Phoenix incident , 11 technical fouls and three flagrant fouls were called against the teams , and the game deteriorated into a series of shoving incidents and near-brawls . <p> " I see a team building a particular image and gloating over that image , " says Suns President Jerry Colangelo , who for four years was chairman of the NBA 's rules and competition committee . <p> The Knicks are quick to defend themselves . <p> " I remember when ( the John MacLeod-coached 1990-91 Knicks ) got swept by the Bulls and everybody called this a heartless , gutless team , " says Riley . " Now we 're playing hard and tough , and they 're saying we should be like that again . Well , we 'll never be soft again , not as long as I 'm here . " <p> The Knicks do bristle at the notion they are dirty , however . <p> " We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dirty team , " says Checketts . " People try to make it seem like we accomplished something in an underhanded way . We play hard every game , and nothing is going to change that . " <p> Some opponents , surprisingly , do n't see anything wrong with the way the Knicks play . Charles Barkley , who played nine years with the Philadelphia 76ers before going to the Suns this season , understands the Knicks . <p> " That thing we had against the Knicks back in Phoenix is so overrated , " he says . " Doc ( Rivers ) and KJ ( Kevin Johnson ) got into it , but they were n't doing anything but pushing . If Greg Anthony had n't hit Kevin , it would n't have been a big deal . New York has a lot of bodies and they play physical . They 're better-suited to be physical because there are n't a lot of great shooters on that team . They 're just playing to their style . I respect them for that . If they go out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outscore you , they are n't going to ( succeed ) . " <p> Another veteran , Suns guard Frank Johnson , who played many years in the Eastern Conference and in Europe before becoming a Sun , agrees that the Knicks ' makeup dictates their style . " They are n't dirty , " he says . " They just do n't have the personnel to run all the time . They 're just playing their style at their tempo . They 're playing the best way they can to give themselves the best chance of winning as many games as they can . That 's what every team is trying to do . " <p> If the Knicks are getting away with something , exactly what is unclear . Their opponents are getting 25% of their offense from free throws , compared to only 19% by opponents of the Bulls and 17% by the Suns ' opponents . So if they foul a lot , they also get caught a lot , too . Not to be overlooked is that the Knicks are a terrific team . <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is one of the best defensive teams the NBA has seen in a long time , allowing 96 points a game and limiting opponents to 43% shooting from the field , leading the league in both categories . <p> This team was very cleverly assembled by Checketts . He made timely trades and managed the salary cap as well , if not better , than any team in the league to put his team in this enviable position . <p> While most contenders can barely make one deal because of salary-cap restrictions , the Knicks have seven new players this season , acquired through trades , free-agent signings or the draft : Rivers ( trade ) , Charles Smith ( trade ) , Bo Kimble ( trade ) , Rolando Blackman ( trade ) , Herb Williams ( free agent ) , Hubert Davis ( draft ) and Tony Campbell ( trade ) . They also have three new starters : Rivers , Starks and Smith . <p> Power forward Charles Oakley is the perfect complement to Ewing , and Starks has developed into the one of the top all-around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team is focused . <p> Riley might work his players harder than any coach , but the Knicks have responded . They might not love Riley or always agree with him , but they listen and follow his lead . <p> But this is Ewing 's team , and the All-Star 's only focus is winning the championship . " Nothing else matters , " he says . <p> Says Riley : " I think Patrick feels better about the guys he has now . He wants it , and he wants it badly , and he is n't going to let anybody mess with this opportunity . That 's what leadership is about . "
