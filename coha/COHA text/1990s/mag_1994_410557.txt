As we near the end of our century , there is more spiritual openness and more of a yearning for a religious view of life than there was at its beginning . Part of this new hunger for the sacred is the result of disenchantment with modern substitutes for religious faith . I remember officiating at a baby naming for a family that had resettled in the U.S. from the Soviet Union . The father , taught to revere the icons of the communist state and to regard religion as a reactionary illusion , looked at his infant daughter and asked me , " Rabbi , do you believe in God ? " When I replied yes he responded , " I do n't , but I hope she will . " Modernity has enthroned not only political ideology but technology . The modernist faith in technology as fueled by the hope of total dominion over nature , of being empowered to bend our world to our purposes But as we move toward the 21st century we are sobered by a new sense of limits . Our assertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is also a growing awareness that the most profound answers to life 's most important questions come not from science but religion . This increased openness to religion heightens both the perils and the opportunities for religious leaders . Two historic examples illustrate the signs by which we can recognize perverted religious leadership . The first comes from the history of my own people : In the 17th century a man named Shabbetai Tzevi claimed to be the long-awaited Jewish messiah . Many thousands of European Jews believed his claim . Even when he violated basic moral and ritual requirements of the Torah  --  indeed , even when , under pressure from the Turkish sultan , he abandoned Judaism altogether and converted to the sultan 's religion  --  many aid not cease to believe in him . Tsevi himself and some of the rabbis who supported his claim justified his strange conduct in at least two ways . They claimed that he either had violated ordinary morality in the name of higher principles that had been revealed to him , or that , yes , he did sin and tat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community to redemption by his own immersion in sin Was Shabbetai Tzevi a willful charlatan , or was he merely deluded ? We do not know , but this much is certain : his perversion of spiritual leaders resulted in mass disillusionment within the European Jewish community . Although of a different order of magnitude , last year 's tragedy at Waco , Texas , also reveals the danger of perverted religious authority . David Koresh signed one of the last letters to his people with Hebrew script as " Koresh Adonai , " which can be translated " Koresh is God . " While presumably grounding his authority in Jewish and Christian scripture , he alone determined the norms by which the community and he , the leader , lived . Thus he separated husbands from wives , defined intimacy between husband and wife as adultery and intimacy between himself and any of the women ( including 11- and 12-year-olds ) as proper . He expropriated his followers ' belongings and used their contributions to satisfy his whim for creature comforts and to amass an arsenal . He imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and food deprivation . Though there is much that separates the case of Shabbetai Tzevi from that of David Koresh , each exploited spiritual hunger and violated basic trust From their example we can extrapolate two basic principles : 1 ) Beware of the religious leader who encourages for himself that adoration which should properly be focused on the One he is called to serve ; 2 ) Beware of a religious leader who cavalierly violates deeply held religious norms or redefines what is permissible behavior in ways that obviously gratify his ego and impulses . A Tzevi or a Koresh illuminates by contrast what remains a paramount hallmark of responsible religious leadership : the teacher must model the teaching . As Martin Buber has written , " Either the teachings live in the life of a responsible human being or they are not alive at all . " Religious leaders have often been distinguished from their communities by burdens and privileges . Aaron the priest and his sons had special access to the symbols of worship . They presided at the altar and maintained the holy vessels . They accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders today are also often distinguished by cultic privileges and burdens . If they wear special attire , or stand some distance from the congregation in worship , or accept certain vows which restrict their lives , those acts in themselves do not necessarily constitute holiness . Such actions may be temptations to self-adoration , manifestations of yetzer hara , the evil impulse . In rabbinic Judaism temptation to evil focuses heavily on two sins . The first is idolatry , the worship of false gods , including oneself . The sin of idolatry may be manifest in the leader 's inclination to blur the distinction between his own power and God 's . Even Moses , perhaps the greatest religious leader in the history of Israel , was not immune to this temptation . Some medieval Jewish commentators regarded Moses ' striking of the rock rather than speaking to it as God had commanded as an instance in which Moses arrogate to himself and to Aaron the power of God . Before striking the rock Moses . assembled the people and declared : " Listen , you rebels , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you ? " Here , said Nachmanides , is the core of Moses ' sin . Here is why he was denied entry into the promised land . At that moment he saw himself not as an agent or servant of the Most High , but as the source of the miracle if water gushed from the rock . If the first focus of he ancient rabbis ' discussion of the yetzer hara is idolatry , the second is sexuality . A talmudic tale frames the issue . When a certain rabbi observed a man and woman not married to each other walking down a wooded path he mused : " I must follow them and keep them from succumbing to the evil impulse . " He observed them from a distance  --  and lo and behold , when they reached a fork in the road , they simply separated without having acted improperly . The rabbi , far from feeling relieved , was troubled . We found himself thinking , " If I were in that man 's place , I am not sure I would have been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort in the words of the prophet Elijah , who appeared and reminded him that " the greater the man , the greater the yetzer . " Translation : What makes you think that because you are a religious leader you should be above temptation ? Far from it . The greater a person 's learning , power , authority or charisma , the more energy he or she has for good or evil and the greater the temptation to abuse that energy and power . Even the spiritual virtuoso never has it made . As the Talmud insightfully notes , there is no area where the religious leader 's modeling is more required and none where the temptation to violate boundaries is more acute and devastating than sexuality . A person may turn to a religious leader in time of trouble seeking comfort in the teachings of the faith , resources to cope with the darker side of life , away to resist despair and assert that in spite of everything there is meaning . The religious leader who is cast as counselor mediates for the troubled person not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . In such encounters the religious counselor is in the position of authority vis-a-vis a vulnerable , wounded person . That person needs to feel safe , able to speak honestly d expose pain without fear of exploitation . In this context the greatest gift the leader can impart is trustworthiness . Any betrayal of trust , any surrender to the yetzer is not only destructive to the person but alienates that person from his or her religious heritage , making less accessible the precious balm o faith when it is most needed . The burden of modeling does not impose a standard of perfection . Even leaders are persons who stumble . And may there not be spiritual power in a leader who reveals his humanness , his vulnerability ? The religious leader 's personal share in the drama of confession , penitence , restitution and forgiveness is itself a hopeful model for the community he or she serves . It is unreasonable for members of a religious community to expect their leader never to disappoint them . No life and no person is without shadow . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true of our modeling of faith . A faith untouched by doubt or struggle is not a requirement of religious leadership . It may not even always be helpful . Elie Wiesel , who endured the horrors of the Holocaust and witnessed the death of his father in a camp , at first refused to say Kaddish , the prayer expressing praise of God in death as in life . Ultimately Wiesel recited the Kaddish , which ( in an autobiographical novel ) he calls " that solemn affirmation filled with grandeur and serenity by which man returns to God his crown and his scepter . " Wiesel 's confession of doubt and struggle and his refusal to abandon God have empowered him to help us remain sons and daughters of the covenant in a post-Holocaust world . Wiesel has said : " A Jew can be for God and with God and against God but not without God . " But though religious leaders need not model perfection in deed or creed , neither can they model moral frailty and lapses of faith . The communities they serve must discern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the quality of their leaders ' lives . Especially in a postmodern age where so many ideologies have been discredited , so much disenchantment has been endured , and so many leaders have failed , what we bring most compellingly to the task is our life  --  a life that credibly witnesses to the power of our professed faith . That burden is considerably lighter when the leader confines himself to one-night stands  --  when the leader dazzles and mesmerizes and stirs the soul of listeners and then quickly moves on to another community . The burden is greater , far greater , when the leader lives with the community day after day , week after week , year ' after yea for then the community comes to know us as well as our teaching . This is the vocation of those in every tradition who are called not to be religious geniuses , not to found or radically reshape religious communities , but day by day to teach the faith , bring balm to the troubled , lead in worship , call a community to moral accountability and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
