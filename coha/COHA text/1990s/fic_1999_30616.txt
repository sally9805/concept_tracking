Book One : 1943 I was born in 1904 , so that when I was pregnant in 1943 I was near enough to be past the rightful age to bear children . This would be my sixth , and on that morning in February , the first morning I 'd known I was with child , I 'd simply turned to Leston in bed next to me , the room gray from a winter sky outside the one window , that sky not yet lit with the sun , and I 'd said , " There 'll be no more after this one . " He rolled onto his back , his eyes still shut , the little hair he still had wild and loose on his head . He put his hands behind his head , and gave a sort of smile , one I 'd seen enough times before this . Five times before , to be exact . He said , " Another one , " and kept the smile . Then he said , " What makes you think so ? " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and I paused . I reached a hand up from beneath the quilts , felt the chill of the morning on my skin , that skin the same color gray as the small strip of sky I could see above the box pine and live oak outside the window . I touched Leston 's cheek , did the best I could to smooth out his hair . He was still smiling . I said , " I just know . " Then came the morning sounds , sounds of the everyday of our lives : first the slam shut of the front door as James , our oldest , started on his way to work at Crampton 's Lumber ; then the scrape of our other two boys , Burton and Wilman , from their room above us , the first sounds of tussling and fooling that started now and ended only after dark , the boys back in bed . Those two , I thought as I lay there , my hand back under the quilts to keep warm as long as I could , we 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Billie Jean , my second child , would not be up for as long as I would let her sleep , around her on the bunched and rumpled blankets of her bed the movie magazines she lived for , fanned around her like leaves off a tree . And Anne , my baby , would be stirring soon , then following Burton and Wilman around like a lost dog , wanting only to be one of them , blessed by the rough and tumble of pinecone wars and whittling knives . I heard Wilman say , " That 's not yours , " then Burton putting in , " But it was , " and then the pop and crack of the heart pine floor above us as the two started in on each other . " Boys , " Leston called out , his voice as deep and solid as every morning . The fighting stopped , the room upstairs as quiet now as when they were asleep . " Sir ? " they called out together . Leston smiled , though on my boys ' voices was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the stove . The two of you . " " Yes sir , " they gave back to him , and then their whispering started , and I knew whatever they were fighting over would n't be settled until sometime late in the day , if at all . Leston sat up in bed , turned so that his back was to me , his feet on the floor . He looked to the window , then down to the floor . He brought a hand to his face , rubbed it , ran that hand back through his hair . Wisps of it still hung in the cold air , copper going gray , the line of his shoulders still the same hard and broad line I 'd seen the first time I met him , the same shoulders I 'd held while we 'd conceived each of our children this far . But now , his head hung forward , his hands holding tight the edge of the mattress , I thought I could see for the first time the weight of age upon him , those shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of them already set to working his way through the world , and me with a brand-new one now on the way . Leston had left the quilts pulled back , my face and shoulders and arms out there to the cold . He lifted his face to the gray window again , gave out a heavy breath that shone in a small cloud before him , the room so cold . Leston said , " No more after this will set fine with me . " Then I shivered , felt it through my whole body , a shiver so deep whatever warmth I 'd had beneath the quilts disappeared entirely , and I knew my sleep was over , that day and all the days left to me until this next child was born now begun . I let out a deep breath , too , saw the cloud it made in the room , and in that breath I saw what I 'd known all along , known all the days until this one when I 'd been thinking maybe , just maybe I was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that age was weighing down on hard . I sat up in bed , put my feet on the cold pine floor , my back to Leston . I stood , called out , " Boys , " heard Wilman and Burton holler , " Yes ma'am ! " The floor above us filled up with the scrabbling of two boys trying to get their clothes on , then the rattle of them both on the stairs . I was on my way to the door and breakfast when Leston , behind me and still on the bed , said , " Jewel Hilburn , you take care . " I turned to him , my hand already on the doorknob . He 'd gotten the smile back , his eyes the same deepwater green I 'd known for what felt all my life . I said , " You know I will , " and held my eyes on him . He said , " That I do , " and nodded , and then I was out the door and on into the kitchen . I 'd taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had eased up once I met Leston . Before that , though , before Leston and the stop and start of our having children and trying to feed our own selves , there was a world sometimes I would like to sooner forget than think about at all . But it 's history that matters , what keeps you together in the tight ball of nerves and flesh you are and makes you you and not someone else . I was an orphan at age eleven , my mother dead of a fever , my father not two months before she passed on having broke his neck on a log just under the water at the bend in the Black River , the bend nearest town where the post oak lay low to the water , and where , in spring , light through the leaves breaks across the river so that nothing can be seen beneath . He broke his neck right then , right there , with the quick and simple dare of diving into water , and when I was a little girl of eleven with both my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grandmother I 'd only met three times before , I used to imagine it was n't a fever that killed my mother , but a broken heart at the death of her beloved . But the truth was he 'd moved into a logging shack a year before he 'd broke his neck , and only showed up to our house at twilight on Saturday nights to have at my mother , then to attend church the next morning , his black hair slicked back and shiny with pomade . It was the thick and sweet smell of his hair that woke me up Sunday mornings , me staying up just as late as the two of them the night before , listening through the walls to the mystery they tended to each Saturday night , sounds I 'd hear again only when Leston and I were together , so that on our wedding night twelve years later the low moan he made and the pitch and twirl of sounds I heard coming from me were like the ghosts of my long dead parents , sounds I knew but had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me and me alone . Sunday mornings we would go to church , where we 'd sit in the pew , me between my momma and daddy , their only child . I 'd had a brother , who only now comes to me as part shadow , pail light , a baby born when I was three and who died when I was four , and there are times before I go to bed when I will stop in at Burton and Wilman 's room , sometimes even James ' , though he has fast become a man and lost the look of a child , and I will see in their faces the faintest trace of my brother , the thin baby line of an eyebrow I believe may have belonged to him , the open mouth and pale lips soft with air in and out which perhaps I am remembering , perhaps imagining . No real memories do I have of him , except for the idea somewhere of my daddy holding Joseph Jr . on one knee and playing buggety-buggety , and the picture in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember of my brother , and even calling that a memory is giving the image in my head more credit than is due . After church we would file out of the sanctuary into air even hotter than inside , live oaks thick with gray moss like clumps of a dead man 's hair fairly lit up with the noise of cicadas , everyone everywhere fanning themselves with bamboo and paper fans printed with the words to " Amazing Grace " on one side , Psalm 23 on the other . Daddy would shake hands with Pastor , pass time with whoever might want to , all the time his one arm round my mother 's shoulder , his hair still just as shiny , little runnels of sweat slipping down his sideburns . He acted the part of my daddy , would even on occasion hunch down and kiss me on the cheek , pat my hair , smile at me , though everyone in the entire congregation , and even those heathens not in attendance , knew we no longer lived together . Once we were home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the pat on the head good-bye I hated even more than his showing up at sundown the night before , and kiss my momma full on the lips . Then he would turn , step down off the porch . Without so much as a backward glance or the smallest of waves , he would head off down our dirt road , back to the logging shack not two miles away . Momma and I watched him go each time , watched until the road took him deep into pine and cypress , the green of wild grape vines everywhere that swallowed him up . I wished each Sunday afternoon that green would never let him go , wished he 'd never make it back to whatever pleasures he found during the week , pleasures he wanted to pursue more than plant himself at home with us , his own . We watched him go , and only once we could see no more movement , no more slips of white shirt through the shield of green forest , did we go in . My momma given her whole self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch floor , and moved on inside . I was always the last one out on the porch , just watching that green , hoping he would not find his way out . The day he broke his neck was a Tuesday . I was already home from school , out on the porch with my tablet and thick red pencil , doing my figuring for the next day . I knew even then I wanted to be a teacher , something in me with the need to lead and stand before people and explain in a plain and simple voice bits of the world they could not know were it not for me . I was only eleven , but knew already , too , that my wanting to teach had to do with my momma and how she acted once Daddy had gone , how our trips into Purvis had become ordeals for her , her standing at the dry goods store and touching a bolt of gingham , a tin of baking powder , looking at them as though they were troubling bits of her own history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . I ended up taking her by the hand to Mr. Robineau at the register , where she 'd give her feeble smile to him as I placed our items on the glass counter , him never meeting our eyes but smiling all the same . So that on that Tuesday , when I saw four men through the green of the forest , I was the one to go into the house and take her hand and lead her up from her cane rocker , the one she spent most hours of the day in , and out onto the porch . The men had cleared the trees by then , and I could see them , hair wet , faces white , jaws set with the weight of whatever lay in the doubled-up gray wool blanket they toted , one man to a corner , the middle sagging , nearly touching ground with each step they took . They wore only undershirts and blue jeans , all of them barefooted , their feet red with the dust of the road they 'd walked . I was n't afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oh , " then , louder , " Oh . Oh . " I heard her take one step back , then another , but there she stopped . The men were off the road and onto our yard now , their eyes never yet looking up to us ; men I could n't place from anywhere . I looked behind me to Momma , saw her there with a hand to her face , covering her eyes , the other hand at her throat and holding on to the collar of her dress . I turned to the sound of the men on the porch steps , felt myself backing up too . The four of them moved toward me , struggling with the burden they bore , the wool blanket seeming heavier than anything I 'd seen before . Yet they were gentle with it , eased it up and onto the porch itself and inched toward us , finally letting it down onto the wood with a grace I would never see again . They stood back from it , four men with hands on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them , a man with hair as black as my daddy 's , hair flat and wet with strands of it long down and into his eyes , squatted , his elbows on his knees , eyes still on the blanket . He put out a hand , held it a moment above the wool , then reached down , took hold of the blanket , and pulled it back to reveal to us my dead and naked father . His head was bent back from us , so that what I saw first was his throat , already swelled and purple . His face was gone from me , twisted up and away , and for a moment I had no genuine idea in my head who this was , or why he had been brought here . The blanket had been pulled back far enough to bare his chest and arms and stomach and one leg , the edge of the blanket left just below his waist , so that next I saw the pencil-thin line of hair that started at his navel and traced its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hair anywhere else , his skin already turning the milkwhite of the dead , his arms and the one leg I could see bent at the joints , him all movement and peace . " We was swimming , " the man with the black hair said . He still held the edge of the blanket , and my eyes went to his fingers , watched as he slowly rubbed his index finger and thumb together . " We was swimming , and then he just did n't come up . He was jumping off  --  " " Benjamin , " my momma let out , her word choked and hard in the air . " Stop . " The man , this Benjamin , looked up . His fingers stopped moving , his eyes on my momma . I looked up to her . She still had a hand to her eyes , the other at her throat , and then I moved toward the blanket , toward the body I still did n't know was my daddy . I wanted to see the face , know who it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would see him , two of the men who 'd carried him here moved out of my way , their hands still on their hips . I stood next to this Benjamin , and looked down at my daddy 's face . His lips had gone blue , his eyelids gray , his hair matted and snarled . Benjamin let go the blanket . I did n't move , not yet certain what any of this meant . Then he put his hand to my back , held it just below my shoulder blades . The touch was near nothing , only contact . He said , " Your daddy and me was brothers . " But the words did n't mean anything to me . I was thinking of Sunday mornings and the smell of pomade , and of me sitting between the two of them while Pastor gave up to God our congregation 's prayers , and how my God had finally answered the prayer I 'd been whispering to myself while Pastor pleaded for everyone else : I wanted him never to come back . Here was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jesus ' name what I knew would make my momma and me better off in the long run , no matter what those sounds I heard from their room meant . Which is why I reached down and picked up the edge of the blanket my uncle had let fall , and pulled it back over my daddy , covered him up . The four men were watching me now , waiting , I figured , for whatever might happen next . I said , " Bring him on inside . " I paused , then said , " Somebody go find Pastor , too . " It would be lifetimes later before I knew what 'd really kept me out there on the porch Sunday afternoons long after my momma , kept my eyes on the green and searching for signs of his life . Only after the lifetime between my daddy 's death and my momma dying , two months that could n't be measured by any means of a calendar or the movement of the moon ; then the lifetime spent on the little piece of childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandma , in a house more dead than my parents would ever be . Then the lifetime of school I spent away in Picayune , lifetimes that ended , all of them , with my first night with Leston and hearing the ghosts of my momma and daddy there in the room with me . And since then have come countless nights spent with those ghost sounds surrounding us , the strength and power and quiet warmth of Leston 's hardworked body the surest comfort I have ever known . My silent husband 's language grew to be my own body and how he touched me , the miracle of a callused hand placed gently to my cheek , my neck , my breast word enough of the love he held for me . But on that first night , our wedding night , those sounds of my momma and daddy rose up around us like the resurrected dead : I knew love then , the doom and joy of it , the pain of Leston inside me and the pleasure of knowing the promise of a future . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I loved them both enough to wish my daddy dead , but loved them both enough to wish him back . I have taken care of myself since the moment I pulled the blanket over him , a fact Leston already knew before he 'd even let out his words to the cold morning of our room . I knew what loss was , knew what it was God could take away from you , His answers to prayer sometimes the greatest curse you could call down . But even so , I prayed right then and there , my husband sitting on the edge of our bed and growing old in what seemed only the few moments we 'd been awake , myself going the same way , too , I knew , that the baby inside me would be born alive and breathing , with ten fingers and ten toes . That was all I sought , what I figured could n't be too much to ask .
