<p> THE high school students in Bonnie Beckman 's early afternoon class are discussing today 's assignment : to guess the proper fairy tale from an oblique headline . But conversation quickly moves from their views of the fairy tales to talk about whose child likes what story . <p> " My son likes that book : ' The People in the Neighborhood . ' " <p> " My oldest son - his father 's in jail . " <p> " When are you due ? " Ms. Beckman asks a pregnant teen at one point . " June ? And you are going to the prom in May ? " <p> So it goes with some of America 's most disadvantaged youths - teenage parents . A look at the statistics shows that many of them are drifting toward failure . <p> They are among the most likely students to drop out of school . From there , it 's a short step to long-term welfare dependence . More than half of all welfare households are headed by women who first gave birth before they were 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 billion a year . <p> A three-year-old program here in Ohio , however , is throwing them a lifeline . And it can help them swim against the tide , according to a report released yesterday . <p> " We were somewhat surprised by how well it seems to be working , " says Dan Bloom , lead author of a new study of the program from the respected Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation ( MDRC ) . " The evidence shows that it does have some effect on people 's school enrollment and attendance behavior . " <p> The MDRC study found that 61.3 percent of teens already in school continued to attend classes when they were eligible for the Ohio program , called LEAP ( Learning , Earning , and Parenting ) . That 's a significant jump over those students who were not made eligible for LEAP , of whom only 51.1 percent continued on . The gap was even wider for teens who had already dropped out . With LEAP , 46.8 percent came back to school at some point during the year . Without it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most concrete evidence so far that states can target help to young welfare parents and keep more of them in school . The hope is that more schooling will allow these youngsters to move off welfare rolls and into jobs . Six-year evaluation <p> It 's too early to tell whether that 's happening in Ohio , Mr. Bloom says . The MDRC plans to find that out in the next phase of its six-year evaluation of the program . The social research group was founded by the Ford Foundation and a consortium of federal agencies to test such things . <p> Perhaps the most surprising aspect about LEAP is that it pays teenage parents to stay in school . Those who miss no more than two school days a month ( without a valid excuse ) get an extra $ 62 in their monthly welfare check . Those who do n't get docked $ 62 . The bonuses and sanctions can play an important role in a welfare family 's income , since a mother with one child typically receives $ 274 a month . <p> The program is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child , is on welfare , and does not have a high school diploma or equivalent degree . The cost is relatively low - about $ 300 per teenager per year . Some 20,000 teens have passed through LEAP since the program started in 1989 . <p> Several other states , such as Maryland and Virginia , are experimenting with similar programs that offer financial incentives for school attendance . <p> One of the states with the longest experience with such incentives is Wisconsin . Its Learnfare program , also started in 1989 , docks the welfare check of parents if their children do n't go to school . There are no bonuses . Wisconsin Gov . Tommy Thompson ( R ) wants to expand the program to cover elementary as well as high school students . Sanctions alone hit <p> The idea of using sanctions without rewards has come under fire . One study showed that attendance had improved for some of the students , but critics have charged that the study was flawed . Even President Clinton has criticized the program for helping too few students . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked , " says Mary Ware , project manager for VITAL ( Virginia Incentive to Advanced Learning ) . So Virginia is trying the other end of the spectrum in its three-city pilot program , which has no sanctions . Recipients get around $ 25 a month extra if they meet the goals they set with their coordinators , which includes good school attendance for their children . <p> Although the financial incentives receive the most public attention , they may not be the key to success . Even with LEAP bonuses and sanctions , just over half of the teenage dropouts did not return to school . <p> " What we are finding is that the real incentive is the support of the coordinators , " says Ms. Ware in Virginia . <p> In addition to bonuses , teens in the LEAP program also get transportation assistance , child care , and case managers , who keep an eye on their students and encourage them to stay in school . This human intervention may be just as important as the financial incentives . <p> " For the ones who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. Beckman says about the program . " It depends on LEAP workers . " <p> Perhaps that result should n't be so surprising . Financial challenges are just one of many obstacles these teenage parents face . <p> Antoinette Daniels is a 19-year-old mother and LEAP recipient . She admits she has , in her words , " messed up " in the past . " I did n't get pregnant because my mother did n't love me " or some other psychological need , she says . " I got pregnant because I was curious . " <p> Her school attendance has been checkered . LEAP bonuses have given way to LEAP sanctions for periods when she dropped out to care for her son or , once , out of " sheer laziness . " <p> Now back in school , she has high hopes of going on to college in the field of computers , or accounting . " I plan on making it to the top , " she says . " I plan on being more than I am . " <p> Miss Daniels is pregnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a harder time . Her father is in Denver ; her mother , a crack cocaine addict , is presumably in Tennessee . <p> " I wanted to go back to school , " she says of the time she lived with her mother , but most of their money went to feed her mother 's habit . " If the money was gone , I could n't get bus fare to go to school . " <p> Miss Sutton now receives welfare directly - $ 606 a month to care for her two sons and to serve as guardian for her younger sister . That includes her $ 62 LEAP bonus for good attendance . She is waiting for an acceptance letter from the University of Cincinnati , where she hopes to train to become a middle school teacher . <p> " I refuse to be a statistic , " Sutton says of her welfare status . " It 's a cycle . And I want to be a role model for my two sons . "
