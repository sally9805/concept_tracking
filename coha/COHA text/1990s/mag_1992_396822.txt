TURN ON THE HIGH BEAMS Where you look as you ski is very important . Many skiers focus just ahead of their ski tips instead of looking farther down the hill . This often turns terrain changes , icy spots , or other skiers into surprises that require quick reactions . Many falls or close encounters can be avoided if you simply look ahead . Think about night driving and how you use both low beams and high beams . As a driver , you feel much more secure using your high beams whenever you can , because you can see more of what lies ahead . Apply this principle in your skiing . The " low beam " position is what skiers typically use  --  looking just ahead of their ski tips . Now turn on the " high beams " by turning your head and looking directly down the hill , in the direction of your next turn . Now you have a broad view of the slope . You 'll be aware of other skiers , obstacles , moguls , etc. , you can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll enjoy your skiing more because you 'll have a broader view . This does n't mean you 'll never use the low beams . Good skiers are constantly shifting between low beams and high beams to get both the short and the long view . Developing this skill improves both performance and awareness . How much does it improve performance ? When I was coaching the U.S. Ski Team , we trained our racers to constantly shift between low beams and high beams . When they learned it , we saw improvements of as much as two seconds per run . When you consider that races are often won by a few hundredths of a second , that 's a significant change . Bob Harkins is the director of skier development at Sunday River , Maine . STEER YOUR INSIDE SKI In pursuit of parallel turns intermediate skiers often complain of crossing their tips . Taking the time to focus on what the inside ski is doing will help solve this problem  --  and bring your parallel turn closer to perfection . As an intermediate skier , you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside ski in the turn  --  and edging that ski to shape your turns . Here 's an exercise to show you what to do with the inside ski so that it complements the action of the outside one . Stand on your livingroom carpet at home . With your weight balanced over your left foot , draw an arc on the carpet with the inside ( big-toe ) side of your right foot ( Figure A ) . ( Figure A omitted ) The arc you 've just inscribed on the carpet is similar in shape to the arc your right ski would carve in the snow when you make a turn . Now stand with your weight over your right leg and with the little-toe side of your left foot , try to make a parallel arc on the carpet ( Figure B ) . ( Figure B omitted ) This arc resembles the one your inside ski would carve in a parallel turn . Practice this until you get a feeling for how much your left foot has to rotate in order to draw this smaller , inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so . When you get onto the slopes , ski an easy groomed run and feel the arc your outside ski makes when you turn . Once this is solid in your mind , switch your focus to your inside ski . Remember those concentric arcs that you drew on the carpet , and how you had to turn your inside foot and knee to draw an arc that was complimentary to the one made by your outside foot ? Now try to re-create that complementary arc on the snow by rotating your inside ski as you make your turn . You 'll find that by actively steering your inside ski in this way , your outside ski will turn easier , your tips wo n't cross as often , and your skiing will move closer to that of an advanced skier .

The key to effective ice skiing lies in how smoothly you can create and regulate the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn . On soft surfaces like packed powder , the edges dig into the surface and it is very easy to find a stable base of support . In soft snow , most skiers turn by moving the skis out away from the body and then bracing against the outside ski . On ice it is difficult to get the outside ski to dig in so if you brace against it , the edge is likely to break loose and skid . So on ice , your actions need to be much more subtle . Think of this as " guiding " the skis through the whole turn . That means gentle turning of the feet and legs in a continuous action from start to finish . Instead of cranking your knees into the hill all at once to put your skis up on edge , increase the edge angle gradually by rolling the ankles , knees , and hips forward and to the inside as the turn continues . Be patient and allow pressure to build on the outside ski without forcing it . Practice this gentler style of guiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually work up to more difficult runs . While ice may never be your favorite condition , with practice you will be more and more comfortable on it . And the sensitivity and precision that ice skiing requires will also improve your overall skiing skills for all conditions . Sal Raio is the ski school director at Deer Valley , Utah . TAKE A DOUBLE-POLE BREAK In cross-country skiing , it 's a real advantage to use as many different techniques as possible , to allow certain muscles to rest while using others . Double-poling is a perfect example . Whether you 're skating or diagonal-striding , your legs will supply the lion 's share of the force to propel you along . Double-poling will shift the propulsion power to your arms and shoulders , giving your legs a break while maintaining speed . Racers and recreational skiers alike can benefit from this efficient and powerful stroke . Double-poling is most easily learned on a two-groove set track . Once mastered , the technique is best utilized on flats and gradual uphills , especially when your skis are already gliding too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . Extend your upper body and arms forward , then plant both poles simultaneously and push down and then back . Be sure to extend your arms as far forward as you can before planting your poles . But keep the shafts of your poles vertical as you reach forward . Apply downward force as soon as you plant your poles , getting additional power by bending your upper body at the waist , and continue to push back as your hands pass your hips . As you thrust the poles out behind you , keep your upper body parallel to the ground . Keep the muscles in your legs rigid as you pole . By the end of your double-poling stroke , your weight should be back on your heels , on the rear gliding portion of your skis . This will enhance your forward glide . Even when you start ascending a hill , continue to double-pole as far as you can rather than changing immediately to a diagonal stride . Double-poling is a great break from your usual leg-powered stride or skate . If you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someday .
