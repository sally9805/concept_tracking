<p> You probably do n't know Fair , Isaac and Co. , but the San Rafael firm may have helped determine the dollar-limit on your credit card , whether or not you got an auto loan and even if your tax return gets audited . <p> Fair Isaac develops statistical models , dubbed " scorecards , " that try to predict consumer behavior based on the behavior of people with similar attributes . Its main customers are credit-card issuers  --  banks , retailers and auto companies  --  that want to know which applicants are most likely to be deadbeats . <p> Fair Isaac 's formulas " score " potential cardholders based on a dozen or so factors , such as whether they rent or own a home ( owners get more points than renters ) , their occupation ( professionals usually get more points than retirees , who usually get more points than blue-collar workers ) , and credit-bureau reports ( subtract points for derogatory credit references ) . Higher scores translate into better credit risks . <p> Most scorecards are good for three to seven years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry Rosenberger , Fair Isaac 's president and chief executive , said that as late as the 1970s , scorecards included the presence of a home phone , which at that time was still a luxury for many people . <p> More recently , the 35-year-old company has begun scoring not just potential , but existing credit- cardholders based on their actual activity : Do they pay off their balance each month or make only the minimum payment ? Do they run up their cards up to the limit ? Do they use the card mostly for merchandise or cash advances ? <p> Credit issuers use these so-called " behavior scores " in dealing with consumers . If you miss a monthly payment , for example , the issuer may look at your behavior score to decide if you should get a threatening phone call , a polite letter or no reminder . <p> MORE CARDS NOW SCORED <p> By the middle of 1990 , more than half of the country 's 200 million-plus Visa , MasterCard and Discover cards were behavior scored , up from only 14 percent a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although Fair Isaac contends that computerized scoring is more reliable and less biased than human judgment , consumer advocates point out that it has never been tested by any regulatory agency . <p> " Another problem we have with credit scoring is that most consumers do n't know it exists , how it works , where to find their score or what it means , " said Gerri Detweiler , director of Bankcard Holders of America . <p> Fair Isaac also develops scorecards for auto-loan companies  --  its single biggest customer is General Motors Acceptance Corp .  --  and , more recently , for auto and homeowners insurance companies that want to know which policyholders are most likely to file a claim . <p> IRS ALSO A CUSTOMER <p> Another customer is the Internal Revenue Service , which uses Fair Isaac technology to determine which tax returns , if audited , are likely to produce the biggest tax due . <p> Even though the recession has led to a sharp contraction in consumer credit  --  it was down 2.8 percent in December alone  --  Fair Isaac posted a strong turnaround in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 30 , revenues rose 25 percent to $ 31.8 million and net income , after declining for two straight years , surged 76 percent to $ 2.8 million . For the first quarter of fiscal 1992 , sales were up 23 percent and earnings rose 40 percent . <p> Since January 1990 , Fair Isaac stock , traded on Nasdaq , is up 176 percent to 13 1/4 . The stock is not heavily traded , in part because corporate insiders own 38.5 percent . <p> During the late 1980s , Fair Isaac was suffering from myriad problems : professional-staff defections , increased competition and what Chief Operating Officer Robert Sanderson termed " a general lack of management attention . " <p> SWITCHING EMPHASIS <p> At the same time , the company switched its emphasis from selling to end-users for a one-time fee , to selling through third parties on a per-use basis . These third parties include the nation 's three largest credit bureaus  --  TRW , Trans Union and Equifax  --  and three of the nation 's biggest credit-card processing companies , which handle billing and other services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good one , said Hambrecht &; Quist analyst Dirk Godsey . " I always favor recurring revenue streams to one-time sales . " But short term , the switch hurt profits because research , development and other costs continued to climb , but could n't be recouped in one fell swoop . <p> By 1991 , most of the company 's internal problems had been solved and sales , especially of its newer products , began to perk up . Fair Isaac has three major lines : <p> * Products used to prescreen credit-card applicants for direct mail solicitations . One of these , PreScore , allows credit-card issuers to search through credit bureau files for promising prospects . Several bills pending in Congress , however , would outlaw prescreening of credit-card customers , thus eliminating the PreScore market . <p> * Products used to screen credit applicants . These application screening scorecards and software sold like crazy during the mid- 1980s when credit-card issuers flooded mailboxes with credit- card solicitations . In the past few years , though , sales of these products have tapered off , hurt by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consolidation in the banking industry and loss of market share to its major competitors  --  Management Decision Systems and American Management Systems . <p> CEO Rosenberger admits that " consumer credit is nearly a saturated market in the U.S. To grow , credit issuers will have to retain good customers and get them to spend more . " Which leads us to Fair Isaac 's third product type : <p> * Products used to monitor and control the credit behavior of existing customers . Known as " adaptive control systems " or ACS , this line includes behavior scoring and other mechanisms designed to help credit-card issuers increase usage and reduce delinquencies . <p> The recession , combined with the proliferation of new cards over the past decade , pushed delinquencies from 4.37 percent of outstanding balances in November 1989 to a peak of 6.28 percent in February 1991 . Since then , they have moderated somewhat , to 5.94 percent in November 1991 . <p> ACS helps credit-card issuers decide , among other things , whether they should renew a cardholder 's account , increase the customer 's credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his or her limit . <p> ACS A PROMISING LINE <p> Cato Carpenter , analyst with Alex , Brown &; Sons , said ACS is Fair Isaac 's fastest-growing and most promising line . He said that revenues from ACS were up 85 percent in the first quarter and now account for 35 percent of total sales . <p> Carpenter , who has an " aggressive buy " on Fair Isaac stock , predicts that fiscal 1992 earnings per share will be up 30 percent . <p> H &Q's; Godsey also sees earnings growing at 20 percent to 30 percent annually over the next few years . Yet the stock is selling at just 20 times projected 1992 earnings , compared to 25 to 30 times for other information services companies . <p> Where will this growth come from ? Fair Isaac executives see three major places . <p> * Existing credit markets , especially for adaptive control systems . <p> * Foreign markets , notably Japan , Germany and the United Kingdom . <p> * New U.S. markets . COO Sanderson said his company has barely scratched the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are huge compared to credit cards . <p> One related market Fair Isaac will not enter is home mortgages . " Most mortgage companies do n't have enough bad loans to provide us with the numbers " needed to develop scorecards , Rosenberger said . <p> Nor will Fair Isaac apply its technology to personnel selection , which it tried in the 1960s . Although the experiment was successful in predicting how long an employee would stick with the company , Rosenberger said it was impossible to quantify what made a good worker . <p> FAIR , ISAAC AND COMPANY <p> AT A GLANCE <p> Business : Consumer-credit evaluation systems . <p> Headquarters : San Rafael <p> Employees : 350 <p> CEO : Larry Rosenberger <p> Ownership : Publicly traded on Nasdaq <p> Latest stock price : 13 1/4 , up 1/4 <p> 52-week high-low : 13 1/4-6 <p> . <p>  --  Operating results : ( In thousands ) Revenues Net income 1991 $31,786 $2,757 1990 25,453 1,565 1989 23,239 1,967 1988 21,015 2,374 1987 18,109 2,071 .
