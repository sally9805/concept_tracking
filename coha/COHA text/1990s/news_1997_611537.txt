<p> Charles Fipke began his long-shot hunt for diamonds in a logical place , sampling around the edges of a site in Canada 's Northwest Territories already being explored by diamond giant De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd . Long after De Beers had picked over the ground and concluded Canada was no place for a diamond mine , Fipke and his partners kept scouring the tundra in helicopters and rubber rafts , retracing an ancient glacial trail he was convinced would make him rich . <p> He was right . Roughly a decade after beginning the search , financed by investors who bought stock at 20 cents a share , Fipke and his group stuck a shovel near the edge of a lake and turned up earth dripping with satellite minerals that pointed to a network of diamond-bearing veins further beneath the ground . <p> What he found touched off an exploration stampede that surpassed the last century 's Klondike gold rush and reinforced the gospel of Canada 's mining industry : There 's a lot of stuff under the ground here , and much of it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first diamond mine is now underway northeast of Yellowknife , and Fipke , rather than being considered delusional in his home town of Kelowna , British Columbia , has become a folk hero who made a trusting group of friends and neighbors wealthy . <p> " If I came to you and said , ' I 'm going to Mars , ' that is what it felt like " in the early days of the search , Fipke said . " People did n't believe . . . . They still think we 're a scam . " <p> After a lull in recent decades , Canada 's mining industry has rebounded vigorously in the 1990s . In part , local finds like Fipke 's have buoyed the mining business . Also contributing , however , are hundreds of international exploration projects by Canadian companies pursued in countries throughout Asia , South America and elsewhere . <p> Along with the diamond project in the Northwest Territories , Canadians are developing the world 's largest nickel mine along the Labrador coast . Canadian companies are also at the center of a tangled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's biggest gold mine . The massive Busang gold deposit was discovered by Bre-X Minerals Ltd. , a junior Calgary company whose own penny-stock-to-riches tale was clouded by troubles navigating the Indonesian government . The company 's Indonesian holdings are sought by two larger Canadian firms that appear better positioned to win favor with President Suharto 's government . <p> Back home , smaller-scale miners converged on northern Ontario last fall when part of the province was reopened for exploration . Miners raced through the bush with hammers and signs to mark their plots in a sort of Canadian tradition : the staking rush . In the Yukon , " lifestyle " miners while away the summer panning for gold by hand . Much of Canada is still held by the government as " crown land , " and the provinces generally encourage miners  --  professionals and weekend hobbyists alike  --  to stake claims and see what they can dig up . <p> The mystique is not hard to explain . Canada was built on people 's ability to drag a living out of the ground , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1890s to recent tales like Fipke 's , the romance has been particularly strong with mining . <p> Canadians " have mining in their blood , " said Anne McLellan , Canada 's minister of natural resources . " Mining is the history of the country  --  one of the things that drove the economy and the whole sense of developing the nation . " <p> It has come at a price : Environmentalists estimate that it would cost more than $ 4 billion to clean up Canada 's hundreds of abandoned mines , some of which have left a legacy of pollution in places like Vancouver 's Tsolum River . Fish disappeared from the Tsolum in the 1970s , after a nearby copper mine closed , and there is no national fund or established way to pay for its reclamation , said Alan Young , executive director of the Environmental Mining Council of British Columbia . <p> Modern practices have improved , but " we do n't have any proven answers , and there are still mines going in that will be long-term toxic waste sites , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others tried to address such concerns in 1994 . A series of meetings in Whitehorse , capital of the Yukon , resulted in an agreement in which industry pledged to share the benefits of its activities more broadly and committed itself to better environmental practices , while the government promised to reduce regulatory , tax and other barriers to ensure that the Canadian industry stays competitive globally . <p> So far , there is little question that it has  --  even to the point of challenging long-held stereotypes about Canada 's role in the world . In a country with a reputation for good deeds abroad and caution at home , mining shows Canada 's aggressive , risk-taking side . <p> The Toronto and Vancouver stock exchanges raise hundreds of millions of dollars in capital through low-price , high-risk stocks that finance the exploration activities of junior mining companies like Bre-X or Fipke 's Dia Met Minerals . For each winner , there are hundreds whose dreams never materialize , but the lure of a big strike keeps the money flowing . <p> " It is a dichotomy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Vancouver company that has specialized in financing mineral ventures in newly opened economies . " As a culture , Canadians are averse to risk . In mining , it is the exact opposite . . . . There is nothing that has more romance than exploring for gold . " <p> Or diamonds . Or nickel . Or any of the other minerals that Canadians prospect for across their own country , and , increasingly , in the rest of the world . <p> The overseas projects have not all been smooth . Although the government and mining industry groups encourage companies to follow the same environmental and labor practices abroad as they do at home , Canadian firms in the Philippines and Guyana have been responsible for environmental damage that has activists calling for stricter rules . <p> Bre-X 's Indonesian saga has been controversial as well , entwining three Canadian companies trying to curry favor with one of the world 's most autocratic governments . At stake is a mine estimated to hold as much as 90 million ounces of gold . <p> It has been an intriguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle power more interested in peacekeeping and humanitarian projects than in brokering world-beating deals . Bre-X raised eyebrows when it invited Suharto 's eldest son to share in the project , a key tactic in a country where the president 's offspring almost invariably have a stake in major business deals . But Bre-X was apparently outplayed by Barrick Gold , the mining company developed by Canadian investor Peter Munk . Barrick 's advisers include former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney and former president George Bush ; its Indonesian contacts included Suharto 's eldest daughter . <p> Meanwhile , thousands of miles away , in the central African country of Zaire , political upheaval imperils other Canadian ventures . Rebels who now control vast gold reserves in southeastern Zaire are demanding that Barrick , Toronto-based Banro Resource and Mindev , a Canadian-Belgian firm , negotiate with their self-declared state or lose their concessions altogether . <p> Like the overseas enterprises , Fipke 's diamond discovery in the Northwest Territories also has been dogged by environmental , political and social questions . At its outset , the project will require the destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need a network of roads around the mine site . What that means for migrating caribou herds , or the fishing and hunting patterns of native groups , is anybody 's guess , said Kevin O'Reilly , research director for the Canadian Arctic Resources Committee . <p> Fipke 's company and its senior partner , BHP Minerals , spent millions of dollars preparing environmental studies and have received the necessary federal permits to proceed . But at a time when Arctic and mining policies in Canada are focusing on how to use resources in a sustainable way , O'Reilly said the diamond mine project " really gets to the commitment and capability of the Canadian federal government to regulate development in the north . . . . I do n't think there is a recognition that limits are needed . "
