<p> MATISSE comes to Paris . Or more accurately , Matisse comes home to Paris . The French capital is where , in the first two decades of the century , Henri Matisse 's art flowered into its revolutionary first maturity . The Pompidou Center has given over its entire 5th floor to an exhibition concentrating on that period : " Henri Matisse 1904-1917 . " The exhibition continues through June 21 . <p> It is a splendid show and proving instantly popular . The press preview alone was invaded by more people ( many definitely not bona fide reporters ) than the center 's somewhat discontented staff could cope with . Opening day was dogged by a strike , and thereafter long lines snaked away from the entrance in spite of the bitter cold and a ticketing system that does n't seem to work too well . But Parisians have long loved to line up endlessly for major exhibitions - it 's all part of the occasion . <p> Theoretically this is not a hyped show . Word of mouth among the cultured Parisians generally works satisfactorily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " do line entire walls in some Metro stations . And the newspapers and television give plenty of space to the show . Le Figaro 's women 's page even suggests the return of Matisse chapeaux . Its weekend supplement features food photographs a la Matisse still lifes . <p> But in one sense this show has already been upstaged by the exhibition from which it derives - the giant Museum of Modern Art ( MOMA ) retrospective in New York that ended in January , with its 900,000 visitor total . That exhibition , described by its instigator and driving force , John Elderfield , as aiming to present for the first time ever " the whole Matisse , " is by definition a hard act to follow . <p> Nathalie Garnier , the press contact for the Pompidou show , emphasizes that the center " likes to organize ' focus ' exhibitions . " It is also , she says , one of the most wonderful periods of Matisse 's art that is on view . But she adds that , in all honesty , questions of money also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibition . <p> Three places are especially rich in Matisses : Russia , France , and America . For Mr. Elderfield 's show to be the comprehensive display he intended , he needed cooperation between these countries . MOMA , the Pompidou , and the Russian museums in Moscow and St. Petersburg have all lent substantially to each other : Yet another version of the exhibition will be in Moscow ( July 16 to Sept. 5 ) and St. Petersburg ( Sept. 25 to Nov. 8 ) . Over and above the arrangements between the main institutions , many small museums and private collectors have lent works . <p> In fact , the Paris version of the show is big by most standards . It has a different catalog from MOMA 's book , but it is still thorough and as physically weighty as anyone could wish . But quality in art shows is more to the point than quantity , and some critics are finding the Paris exhibition - even though it is still incredibly difficult to actually look at the paintings because of the milling enthusiasts - less of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matisse than the New York exhibition . <p> By concentrating on one period only , though , the Pompidou show does what Elderfield wanted to avoid at MOMA . The thesis for his show was that Matisse has already been shown in isolated fragments many times . What was needed , he argued , to see Matisse afresh in all his complexity and seriousness , was the ultimate : all of Matisse in one place . Well , all of Matisse 's paintings , anyway . Well , most of them . <p> The truth is that certain key works were not available , " La Femme au Chapeau " ( 1905 ) from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art , for instance . It 's not available for Paris , either , which is even more of a pity , as it was a cause celebre in the period covered . And since all Matisses look far better in the original than in reproduction , this has got to be a painting worth seeing face to face . <p> Again , New York did not have " Luxe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This one belongs to the Musee d'Orsay in Paris , and it is in the Pompidou show . The reason some paintings are refused for large exhibitions is often their condition . With the San Francisco " Femme " however , it is the terms of the bequest that prohibit its traveling . <p> One gorgeous Matisse that was n't in New York but is in Paris is the " Interieur aux Aubergines " of 1911 . It belongs to the Musee de Grenoble . The problem there was that it required restoration , which the museum says could not be carried out quickly enough for New York . Completed in time for Paris , this is the last trip this painting will make out of Grenoble . <p> Any major international exhibition of this kind requires a remarkable degree of coordination among the participants . This exhibition brings to Paris a great many pictures that have been rarely if ever seen here , and that is the direct result of the barter-exchange system that makes such international bonanzas feasible . Without a substantial cache of works to lend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible to take part in a reciprocal exhibition of this kind . <p> In London , for instance , there have been public mutterings because the Tate Gallery , which made moves in the 1980s to borrow the Russian Matisses for a show , appeared to have lost out to Elderfield and MOMA . But Nick Serota , the Tate 's director , said in an interview , " It would always be against the odds that the Tate could organize a major Matisse show of the kind being seen in Paris or New York . " He points out that New York by itself can provide up to 150 Matisses . " And 250 will probably come from other American collections . If you set out to organize such a show from London , you have four Matisses at the Tate . " ( Actually the Tate owns 10 Matisses , but clearly that 's still not enough ) . <p> Serota adds that , in spite of rumors , the anticipated London show would never have been very big because it would have been confined to the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York and Paris . Serota confides , however , that a major Cezanne show is planned for the mid ' 90s and that it will be shared among London , Paris , and Philadelphia . He promises this will be " one of those great exhibitions that happen once every 10 or 15 years . No doubt people in New York and Washington will then be asking why that exhibition is not in those cities ! " <p> Meanwhile , in 1993 , the Matisse show is in Paris , and one of its great virtues , as in New York , is that it brings together paintings otherwise permanently dispersed . The two versions of " La Danse " ( 1909 and 1910 ) are a striking example - one from the Hermitage , one from MOMA . One is lyrical and ecstatic , the other frenetic and orgiastic , yet both have the same basic organization , a nearly identical ring of figures , broad color spaces , and urgent vigorous drawing . It is differences of color and line , intensely subtle , which give to virtually the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning . <p> This is Matisse 's exploration by his own description : He wrote of his work as a struggle , as a reaction and rebellion against copying nature . " These rebellions led me to study separately each element of construction ; drawing , color , values , composition ; to explore how these elements could be combined into a synthesis without diminishing the eloquence of any one of them by the presence of the others , and to make constructions from these elements with their intrinsic qualities undiminished in combination ; in other words to respect the purity of the means . " <p> The Pompidou exhibition , though covering the so-called Fauve period in which color was liberated from mere description in a brilliant and excited extension of the earlier achievements of Gauguin and Signac , does certainly show Matisse as more than a colorist . It shows him ferociously attentive to the primitive force of African sculpture . We see him aware of cubism , investigating some of the essentially linear structures involved in that style . Particularly in about 1914-15 , we watch him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structural elements . <p> Never an abstract artist , Matisse was clearly aware of the potency of abstraction , and as with anything from the outside that he absorbed , his struggle was to make it his own ; to not relinquish his vision .
