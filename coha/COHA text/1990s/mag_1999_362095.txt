Reporters were promised high jinks at the Reform Party National Convention . " Bring your asbestos suit , " chortled Phil Madsen , an aide to Jesse Ventura , relishing a skirmish between his boss and Ross Perot , the party 's founder . " Its going to be hot . " <P> But a leisure suit would have been more appropriate . First of all , Ventura , the party 's highest-ranking elected official and the repository of its presidential urges , did n't show . Bad weather and a bad back kept him in Minnesota . When they got him on speakerphone , instead of taking on Perot , Ventura promised not to run for President ; his grab for power was more a wink and a nudge . He pitched Jack Gargan , a retired financial consultant , as party chairman , but then swaddled the endorsement in protestations that he was n't telling the fiercely independent delegates how to vote . The room , which had sparked with applause at other points in the speech , went silent as Gargan sat in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done for , but Saturday there was a proliferation of Gargan buttons . Many of those who were undecided said the Body had won their vote . <P> But it was n't all about Jesse . The two Perot-blessed chairman candidates had problems of their own . Thomas McLaughlin , a quiet man known for doing the party chores , seemed too retiring in a party where more than a few delegates think the presidency should be filled by Donald Trump . And the other candidate , Pat Benjamin , the sitting vice chairman , was busy tamping down a war between members of her New Jersey delegation . Accusations swirled that Benjamin had kept delegate contact information away from Gargan . " Such lies , " she hissed . Not a great backdrop for a woman promising to be a unifier . <P> Gargan 's strategy , if he had one , was to play the reluctant warrior . His shock troops were made up of three befuddled senior citizens who swooshed around the ballroom wearing GARGAN 'S GEEZERS T shirts . He compared the chairmanship to captaining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " But I 'm not about to let this ship go down . " Proof that he was a hard worker ? He used to drive live chickens to market , a job that meant stopping every few minutes and beating the sides of the truck to keep the birds flapping and alive . During his speech , he listed his credentials as loving poker , pool and motorcycle rides and having an eye for the ladies . " And those are my good qualities , " he told the hooting crowd . <P> One imagined that somewhere the elusive Perot , a man used to having the last laugh in this party , was not having much fun . In his speech he never mentioned Ventura . And he and Gargan , once friendly , have n't spoken in years . Gargan intends to move party headquarters away from Perot 's home roost of Dallas to Gargan 's nest in Florida 's Cedar Key . He and patron Ventura made clear they 're not interested in a third Perot run for the presidency . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gargan said . <P> Getting the party to follow him there will be challenging because Reformers like being , as they say , " individuals . " These are the people to whom society does n't listen much . But here they can be heard  --  and heard and heard , making the debate , with its shouts of " point of inquiry , " its endless amendments and its glacial balloting , seem mad .
