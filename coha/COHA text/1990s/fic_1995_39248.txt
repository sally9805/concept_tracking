George : dumped now , on his way and six months too late but better out of it at any cost ; George like a spectroscope , that device of many colors at last spun from her life and here is Karen , bone-dry for now , dry bones in a dry season and stripped of all but the wire strength of self-interest , spun by the enormities of her choice . Karen the plasma physicist : coat across her shoulders , brown wool winking and tickling against her bare neck , pretty girl , lost girl now , snow in her hair like a fine decoration as she crossed the uneven landscape of the parking lot , as she put her ungloved fingers to the metal handle of the glass doors , as she entered the scents and silences of the building , then her office , sideways to the lab . Her smell here and George 's too like an animal , like the scent of an empty den : once they had screwed themselves tight against the model of the particle accelerator and committed heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place without conscious recognition , without the application of thought . The beige plain of her workstation , the swivel chair that did not move ; her phone , her books , that one window turned to face darkness all through the day , the brick edge of the building beyond which she could see nothing : she had no view at all . Like the galaxies before time , like the blind , bar animals of her breasts sinking underneath his grunts . <p> In the window then Karen 's face : skin on glass on brick . Forty-two years in that face , revolving suns and the motion of planets , the thin imponderable distances between the stars and the holes of the quasars , oh the idiot dance of knowledge gained , knowledge lost . You can do a lot in forty-two years , she supposed , and she had done if not all then much of it in this office , humped George , plotted coefficients : brick on brick on glass on stone . On bone . On the hones of her lost face , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strength : and cunning : and quietude and solitude and force . Karen 's pressure building ; like the oceans between the stars , the sea-lapping of space that forces further motion , the stars locked like stones in that sea : the pulsing tide of the universe . Certainties and uncertainties , theory and proof . Her face in the window looking inward and out , both and neither , eyes open and closing then upon <p> that other face <p> before her in the glass , behind her in the room . <p> No more hallucination than the last time , no sundering of self in the George  --  cast refraction of this room , no , there were the faces again , her own and twice and a third time : she had not moved , three faces and then six , twelve of Karen , the closure of exponential drift as the faces bunched like flowers , skin and eyes in bouquet to stare at her . Blink . Close and open the eyes , brown eves in their etched netting , slow deliberate open and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them still . Faces all over the glass , emergent , hovering like succubi and dreams . She blinked her eyes again , dry staring eyes which had glimpsed the galaxies and the moles on George 's familiar , unloved neck as he had rolled over her in glum ejaculation , forced motion and then the room was empty again , workstation and telephone , machinery and iron swivel chair and the doorway through which she had entered , rectangular and stolid , filled with nothing but the endless drift of all the things she had never seen . <p> Ache in Karen 's neck ; she had been working all day , now with George and his grunts evicted she worked every day , she did not accept or need the idea of time to herself . Time to herself was the custodian of all loss ; she was alone here anyway , was n't she ? and where else would she prefer to be ? The sound from the daytime corridor of movement : people , papers and bodies , the soundless drift of separation , particles of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelt the explosion and reformation of the galaxies and she sought this with the same drab insistence with which George had hustled himself to a kind of consummation : big bang works two ways , sonny boy . Looking up at the window again and there were the faces , the anti- , the proto-Karens , her own face thrown back at her replicated in a hundred near-guises , yes but no , part but not part , some trick not of sight but sightlessness , there were nothing but reflections now . Empty glass , brick walls and the cold noontime dark of promised snow for this conglomeration of Karens , the bright and the dull , the nascent and the aged , the air color without substance , all Karens now : the seven ages of Karen pinned against substanceless color , the frantic departure of those galaxies and formations , exeunt in the aftermath of that terminal , original explosion and Karen saw them again , there they were <p> there they were <p> smiling at her this time , all of them smiling . The multifarious Karens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , brick and glass and she did not move , did not this time blink or rub her eyes or play the games of cognition to prove the lie of dreaming : faces and faces , the wonderful multiplicity of self , their mouths in motion but not in unison as their smiles had bloomed , a thousand time-lapse flowers but now as they moved their lips to whisper in confidence of the thunder amongst the suns she strained to hear : to somehow merge with them , these Karens who were trying to tell her something : to grow wiser with proximity : to turn as quickly as one rounds on a burglar , on a lying , prevaricating lover , to turn in that wheeling confrontation that would at last lock circumstance : to see nothing behind her but her office , papers , devices , machines : to turn again , herself like clockwork to watch them frowning in the glass and without volition her fingers moved to her own pretty , lost , riven face and touched it : her muscles knew that frown , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the faces in the glass seemed to grow larger without moving , to confront her not as her own aspect , eyes in a mirror but in a harsh and open fashion as something not of herself at all . Heisenberg is incomplete , the face said . Observation does not of itself change circumstance . Observation is circumstance and is factored into the phenomena . If chronology is shattered then all is encountered . <p> I do n't understand , she said . I 'm a plasma physicist , I study consequence , not origin . I do n't know- <p>  --  If chronology is shattered , the face said , then causality is no longer a concern , becomes merely another consequence . Develop your premise properly or face disaster again , Karen , disaster far beyond a worthless faithless lover who you knew from the beginning was a disaster , a subatomic particle of a man , your own quark of collision , that 's all he was . You were not only the observer , you were the moving particle , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space and they are wholly interchangeable . <p> No , she said , go away . Get out of my window . Get out of my office . <p> I 'm not an observer , the face said , you 're the observer . I 'm the particle in remission at the heart of the neutron star whose reaction is your anti-reaction . I am the George of your circumstance , that 's all . <p> Oh my , Karen said , oh my you 're a very poor metaphysicist and did not know if she was saying this to the face or herself , mouth open again to say more and the ringing of the phone startling her so hugely that it might have been the music before time , arranged to form the syllables of her name . She nearly fell from her swivelless chair , stripped of balance and the necessity of the moment by the faces as they aligned and then diminished , faded from perspective and view . She picked up the phone and said no and put it down , two tries to replace it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . They had been all around her , those faces , but the one had been the speaker for them all . Why me though ? Why them ? Why now ? Sitting there in the ungiving curve of plastic and metal she felt the active , darting movement of the atoms of self , each of them in direct , pendant counterreaction to profound and critical musings on the other side of the galaxies , before the origin of time . <p> Later : in the Georgeless apartment with the four windows and single mirror and the uneven stains of his advent planted here and there upon the mattress she tried to discover the meaning of the faces , the other , drifting , whispering Karens but found nothing : no Karens : no whisperings , no one but herself alone beside windows matte with winter light and here the view improved but her mood did not , infused with the glare of galaxies and the iron law of Heisenberg , adrift without prospect of redemption . Redemption ? is that what had chased her into Boolean algebra and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a physicist atone for that glimpse of lost selves which she had last retrieved ? No . No . Abandoned lover 's gloom , the panic of the impermanently devastated , the not-entirely broken . I do n't need this , she said aloud , I do n't want this and that if nothing else seemed true : theories were to be unified , order culled or coaxed or battered from chaos , uncertainties grasped only until their quarks and demons could be excised and examined : there was no need for metaphysics , no need for the search of that point where faith , prayer , nonsense and the dark collided , no sense to any of this unless as imposed sense but still , this certainty of being watched , of being seen from everywhere , one monster nexus shared by thousands of observer-Karens , compound gaze drifting toward that locus of self and she the reluctant queen by observation . If each shred of the hologram contains the image entire does it then follow that the image entire , that Karen herself could be considered as a container @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a quandary ; linked to neither history nor circumstance , a body is alone in a room ; observed and unobserved and now she picks up the telephone , that instrument of demonology and summons from all the power of her conviction one face , one voice : George , calls to him across the singing wire and suspension of space and at last his voice can be heard stammering through the thickets of deceit which had been their portion , lost and lonely and deceived and : They 're watching us , George , she says with a doomed and gleeful certainty , they really are and " Karen ? " that separated voice , " Karen is that you ? You sound so or strange , what do you want ? " and she of stared through the holes in the mouthpiece like the empty , pitted shell of the neutron star into which she is fast descending , blind pilot , shielded capsule like a pill down a hungry throat and : They 're watching us ; George , all of us are being watched- by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we have not been and by the power of disassociation , our disassociation . Do you see ? she says and it all seems so clear , to her at least how clear it seems . Lady physicist , lady of lightning and collision and the empty cold spite of the diminished heavens , imploding toward that point of shrinkage in the neutron star . Gather round , George , gather round , we are watching you , all of us are watching you . As you humped so frantic and juiceless in the wretched bed , so the stars and planets tumble haplessly toward final implosion . In their gathering so we are driven apart ; as they bind to one another , so George , we explode . We explode . George , Karen says and in the expenditure of this final insight laughs and laughs , laughs at her bone-dead lover over the wire of their connection while outside , at the farthest spaces of the further stars those calamitous Karens of all lost and simple nights patiently continue to observe . They are not frightened of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factored in . She could not , she could not come and finally that heaving and consequential fall : then she expelled him like a burnt and deadened star ; falling and falling . Like priests on the mountains , the Karens gather and whisper over her new dreams , her old dreams , in the falling and fallen light , in the light that spills and tumbles , falls forever down the emptied panes of glass into the core of the irretrievable stars . <p>
