On Mandy Patinkin 's first day on the Dick Tracy set , a bizarre apparition walked up to the actor  --  it looked like Olivier 's Richard III in a turquoise pinstripe suit  --  and urgently confided , " He has a vision . He has a vision . " The hunchbacked creature was Al Pacino , in makeup and costume as the archfiend Big Boy Caprice , and the object of his admiration was Warren Beatty . <P> In the tabloid headlines of popular perception , Beatty may be typecast as the roguish movie actor , or the legendary roue , or Shirley MacLaine 's current brother , or the man who persuaded Gary Hart to make one last humiliating run for the presidency . But he is also , over the past quarter-century , the movies ' most distinctive producer-star , with Bonnie and Clyde , Shampoo , Heaven Can Wait and Reds to his credit ( and Ishtar to his debit ) . As the only person to have been nominated for Oscars in four different categories on two separate occasions  --  for acting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can Wait  --  Beatty has to be more than an indefatigable stud . He could be a man with a vision . And he is . <P> He had never faced a sterner challenge than Dick Tracy , his adaptation of Chester Gould 's comic strip about the big-city detective with a right-angle jaw . Batman , the comic-strip blockbuster of 1989 , had entranced moviegoers with its dark , brooding take on urban corruption . Would the brighter , perkier Dick Tracy seem of less heft ? More to the box-office point , would young people want to see the movie ? Who is Dick Tracy anyway ? The strip runs in only about half the 550 newspapers that carried it in the Eisenhower years . And who 's this Warren Beatty ? He has n't had a big hit since Heaven Can Wait in 1978 , a lifetime ago for the new movie generation . If kids knew him , it was mainly as Madonna 's 53-year-old boyfriend . <P> Fortunately , Beatty had the vision thing for Dick Tracy . As he expressed it in code to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a live-action comic-strip movie with a " super-real " feel . The style would be " going to the edge and not falling off . " A 1930s city would come to life , not on location , where reality must be counterfeited , but through mattes , combining live action with painted backdrops , which would lend a " magical " air and keep the budget at a bearable $30 million . The final decision was radical : to shoot the picture in seven primary and secondary colors that would define the characters and story while adding a unique visual humor . " Love it or hate it , " Disney movie boss Jeffrey Katzenberg kept saying , " Dick Tracy will look unlike any movie you 've ever seen . " <P> Love it . Dick Tracy 's look surely does merit rapture , but the movie also has wit and grace in a film era of witless gross-out . Scan the bold sweep of the narrative , which poses ripe dilemmas of career , love and family for a loner sleuth . Hum the songs written by Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed by Madonna and Patinkin . Attend to the bold filigree work of the film 's supporting cast of rogues , most of whom are devil- dolled up in grotesque prostheses and outlandish mannerisms but are given ample room to strut their stuff . Their leader is Pacino , who as Big Boy gives Batman 's Jack Nicholson a lesson or two in how to play a comic-book villain : as part psychotic mastermind , part Hollywood dance director  --  a Bugsy Siegel who wants to be Busby Berkeley .
