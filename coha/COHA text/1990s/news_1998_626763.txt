<p> WASHINGTON - If not for the black robe and the polished wooden bench that puts her at least a head higher than anyone else in court , Norma Holloway Johnson could be holding forth in a classroom . <p> Instead , Johnson - a former teacher who grew up in Lake Charles , La. - is chief U.S. district judge in Washington where her strict command of the courtroom and tough talk on punishment has been compared to a trip to the principal 's office . <p> Until early this year , she toiled in relative obscurity , overseeing grand juries and presiding over trials - some involving high-ranking public officials - that often included stern , finger-pointing lectures . <p> Now , one of Johnson 's grand juries is investigating an alleged cover-up of President Clinton 's relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky , and the judge is emerging as a key , yet enigmatic , figure with a penchant for secrecy . <p> Behind the shrouded windows of her second-floor courtroom near the Capitol , Johnson has wrestled with more decisions about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sirica dealt with Watergate a quarter-century ago . <p> So far , Johnson has ruled that Secret Service agents and key presidential aides must cooperate with the investigation being run by independent counsel Kenneth Starr . <p> Johnson also has decided that Starr did not offer Lewinsky immunity , that notes and other documents kept by her first attorney , Francis Carter , must be turned over to the grand jury and that a Starr subpoena seeking a list of the former intern 's purchases at a local bookstore was invalid . <p> Elevated to the chief judge 's post 11 months ago , Johnson brings to the Clinton-Lewinsky case 18 years of experience as a federal judge , 10 years as a superior court judge and a reputation for bluntness and for siding with prosecutors . <p> " Judge Johnson is a tough , no-nonsense trial judge , " said E. Lawrence Barcella , a former prosecutor who represents white-collar defendants . " We 're talking about somebody who has had extensive experience in lots of different areas . " <p> Johnson , who turns 66 in July , jealously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuses to pose for photographs or provide the names of her current or former law clerks . <p> After Johnson 's brother , Lionel Holloway , was quoted in the New York Times discussing their impoverished upbringing , the judge called him to voice her displeasure . <p> " She 's a very private person , " said her brother , a sheriff 's deputy in Lake Charles . " She asked me not to talk to any reporters about her , and I 'm honoring that . " <p> Interviews with lawyers , friends and family members provide a portrait of a conservative , driven woman with little patience for ill manners or foolish behavior . Even as a child growing up in Lake Charles ' poorest neighborhood , Johnson was studious and well-mannered . <p> " She was always serious , always focused . She took a no-nonsense approach to everything , " recalled Frank Pryce , whose grandfather ran a pharmacy where the teen-age Johnson helped run the soda fountain . " She always knew someday she would be a lawyer . " <p> Born to H. Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Normalie . Her parents separated when she was young , but her father lived a short distance away and they frequently visited until his death in the late 1940s . <p> The dominant influence in Johnson 's life was her mother , who taught adult education classes and stressed the importance of education . She demanded top grades and good behavior from her two children , standards that with reinforcement from teachers had become a way of life by the time Johnson reached W.O . Boston High School . <p> Pryce recalled Johnson leaving Lake Charles before graduation and moving to Washington , where she lived with relatives . He moved to the nation 's capital to attend Howard University and frequently ran into her on the street . <p> " She was always on her way to work or going from work to school , " Pryce said . " That 's all she ever did - work and study . " <p> Johnson attended District of Columbia Teachers College and , after graduation , taught junior high school while studying law at night at Georgetown University . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief stint in private practice , Johnson was hired by the Justice Department . In 1967 , the municipal government in the District of Columbia hired her as an assistant corporation counsel . In 1970 , she was appointed to the superior court bench . <p> During his final weeks in office in 1980 , President Carter nominated Johnson to a vacancy on the U.S. District Court . She became the first black woman to hold a federal judgeship in Washington , and in 1997 - just short of her 65th birthday - was elevated to the court 's top administrative post . <p> In June 1964 , she married Julius A. Johnson , another assistant U.S. attorney who later moved to the Labor Department as an administrative law judge . The Johnsons have no children , but helped put four of their seven nieces and nephews through college . <p> While the Clinton-Lewinsky matter has drawn Johnson reluctantly into the national spotlight , this is not her first high-profile case . <p> Saying she wanted to protect the privacy of victims ' families , Johnson ruled in 1991 that NASA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the space shuttle Challenger exploded on Jan. 28 , 1986 . <p> In 1996 , she sentenced former U.S. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski , D-Ill. , to 17 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to mail fraud . " The guilty pleas do n't reflect the breadth of your crimes , " Johnson scolded the former House Ways and Means chairman . " In your important position , you capriciously pursued a course of personal gain for you , your family and your friends . You have stained them , as well as yourself . " <p> Later that year , she was riled by the behavior of Joseph Waldholtz after he pleaded guilty to writing worthless checks and lying on financial forms about the source of $ 1.8 million pumped into the campaign of his wife , Rep. Enid Greene Waldholtz , R-Utah . <p> While awaiting sentencing , Waldholtz continued to bounce checks and stole credit cards from friends and family members , which prompted Johnson to tack an additional four months onto his 33-month prison term . " No sentence is sufficient to atone for your crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 issue of Washingtonian magazine said Johnson 's " judicial temperament reminds many observers of a mean principal . " During a speech to a lawyers group earlier that year , she said everything attorneys need to know about practicing in her court they " learned in kindergarten . " <p> A 1993 Legal Times analysis of appeals court rulings on decisions by Johnson and her district court colleagues found her reversal rate at 19 percent , slightly higher than the average 17 percent . <p> One of her reversals in 1996 was accompanied by a Court of Appeals order transferring the case to another judge after finding that her behavior was " hostile " to the defendant and her lawyer . An appeals court tally found that Johnson had made 65 negative comments to the defendant 's attorney , 55 of those in the presence of the jury . <p> The appeals court finding in that case does not surprise Sol Z. Rosen , a former criminal defense lawyer who has seen Johnson send some of his clients off to prison with a tongue-lashing . " She 's a stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rosen said .
