Almost all of R. Garcia y Robertson 's short stories for F &SF; have inspired covers . " The Moon Maid " is no different . This time , Doug Anderson brings Rod 's vision to life . <p> About " The Moon Maid , " Rod writes , " The story is historical-fantasy , where the ' fantasy element ' is historical ( based mainly on Herodotus and Diodorus ) and the ' non-fantasy ' parts are invention . But that is how we tend to see the distant parts of space-time  --  not as the inhabitants report them , but as we assume ' it must have been . ' " <p> The Laughing Steppe On the first day of her twenty-second spring , a Moon Maid topped a low rise in the Laughing Steppe , riding her dark mare toward a nomad wagon lagger . She was dressed in animal skins , a fur-lined fleece jacket over stag leather pants and calfskin boots ; her hair hung in long black ringlets from a silver crescent-moon comb . Bow , quiver and mirror case banged against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the boreal wind . She was an only daughter , and her mother had named her Aganippe  --  " The Mare that Kills with Mercy . " <p> Wailing drifted over the longgrass from the Cimmerian camp . A cold wind in her face carried the odors of death  --  dried blood , burnt frankincense , anise , and lion scent  --  making her mare shy . Aganippe leaned down , stroking her mount 's shaggy coat . " Easy Melanippe . Ignore the smells and admire the stallions . " Mollified , the black mare set out again , trampling wildflowers pushing up between patches of snow  --  anemones , irises , and wild tulips . <p> The Hetman in his sable cloak met her at the entrance to the lagger , backed by a mob of armed men with fierce tattooed faces . He was twice her age , with a forked beard , frost gray eyes , and a face as long as a saiga antelope 's . In his right hand he held a bronze-tipped spear  --  his left was pierced by an arrow shaft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grease on his cheeks . <p> Aganippe dismounted and gave her name , saying she was from the Lion Shrine . Men stiffened , staring sideways at her , making signs against witchcraft . <p> Grounding his spear , the Hetman spat in his right palm , then reached to shake her hand  --  showing he did not fear her magic . Next to blood , spittle is the most prized ingredient for fixing spells . " Come , " he told her , " see what your lion has done . " <p> Swallowing her anger , Aganippe shook the man 's soggy palm . What did these nomads know about lions ? They were Cimmerian battle-ax folk , kazakhs who called the gods by strange names , raising temples to war and slaughter . Driven south by a bad winter , they had overstayed their welcome . With the grass well up , they should be following the frost line north . Instead they were making accusations  --  threatening to extend the visit . <p> The Herman 's son was laid out on a cart . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the middle and stuffed with straw , galingale , parsley-seed , and anise . Head and shoulders hung at an angle . Older wives were comforting the boy 's mother and her young daughter-in-law , who were down in the dirt , faces furrowed by their own fingernails , shrieking at the heartless gods who let this happen . <p> Aganippe had hoped to see the slash marks of a leopard , but the throat and chest had been torn open by a single bite  --  otherwise the boy was barely touched . Just a claw mark on the thigh , where the beast braced a paw as it bit down . Only one cat killed that casually . <p> Staring into the face of a corpse is sure to make you question where life is headed . Aganippe felt a surge of pity for the child-widow , wondering what it would be like to cleave to one man , to raise his sons , to weave and spin instead of wearing skins and serving the Lion Shrine . The girl had been pretty , with somber eyes and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clutching her remaining child , a baby daughter . Hers was certainly a miserable lot , alone among pitiless strangers , with no son or husband to give her life . <p> Fortunately she would not suffer long . At the funeral a bowstring would be looped around the girl 's neck , with a short stick thrust through it . After an appropriate prayer the noose would be twisted tight , so she might be buried beside her boy husband . <p> Aganippe told the Hetman , " Show me where this happened . " <p> The nomad chief motioned with his spear . Boys took her mare , and she followed the Hetman past where his yurt stood atop a cutbank , closest to wood and water . Human scalps fluttered atop his tall standard-pole , and a hooded eagle preened herself on a padded stand  --  a hunting bird big enough to bring down a young gazelle . <p> Upstream from the yurt , Aganippe saw the deep broad pug marks of a large lion . She knelt and felt the mud . It had hardened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sticking her nose in the nearest pug mark , she sniffed , then went on to the next , and the next , until she had examined every print . When she was done , she rested on her heels , listening to lowing cattle . A cold feeling crept over her . " Did anyone see this happen ? " <p> The Hetman shrugged . " Thralls watering cattle heard a scream and loosed the dogs . " No help there . The knots of cattle by the bank were tended by blinded slaves . <p> Aganippe turned back to the tracks . Utterly illiterate , she had seen enough kill sites to read the muddy bank like a Babylonian scanning a clay tablet . " In late afternoon a young man with a spear and a child with a water jar came down to the stream . " There was a rounded gouge and a circular mark , where the man had leaned on his spear and the child had set down the jar . <p> The long-faced Hetman nodded . " My son took his daughter to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wheat grass on the far bank . " The lion had been waiting for some time , and leaped straight onto the child . Your son dashed to his daughter 's aid "  --  she showed where the boy 's strides lengthened to a run  --  " and the lion turned to meet him , dropping the child . " Aganippe traced out the curving claw marks and the shallow imprint of a tiny body , also the bigger body print where the lion brought the young father down . Then the lion 's prints turned again , vanishing across the stream and into the tall grass , forepaws pressed deeper by the dead weight of the child in its teeth . <p> The only distinctive feature of the pug marks was the way the left forepaw splayed outward , making the killer easier to track . A good omen , she thought . A godsend actually . Something needed to be done soon to appease these Cimmerians . <p> The Hetman led her up to his yurt , sitting her down inside , pouring wine with his own bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by nomad standards , reeking of sweat and urine  --  but he was her host , and wine would brace her for what had to follow . <p> " This is an Oeorpata , " the Hetman told her , laying emphasis on the last word , " mankiller , " which had a double meaning . It was also a name for Amazons , like the Moon Maids of the Lion Shrine  --  mankillers who obeyed no laws but their own . <p> " No , " Aganippe corrected him , " this is a child-killer . " The lion had not turned on the father until the man attacked . That was what scared her most . The beast passed up cattle and sightless herdsmen , waiting patiently until the little girl appeared . And after bringing down the Herman 's son it ignored the bigger meal , turning back for the child . <p> This was a thinking beast who knew humans , a hunter that picked just the prey it wanted , refusing to be swayed . Aganippe had known a man-eating leopard that stepped over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a third . Like humans , lions specialized . Some hunt antelope , others kill cattle . Prides in Libya hunted elephants . But once cats tasted human flesh , and found it easy to take , they almost never forgot . If a lion dragged its prey home , feeding it to the cubs , a whole pride became infected . <p> Luckily none of the local prides had a large active lioness with a splayed left forefoot  --  this looked to be a wandering male who had learned his killing ways somewhere else . <p> The Hetman tugged at his forked beard . " When I sent word to the Lion Shrine , my men protested . They claimed it would slight us if an Amazon brought in the lion  --  though the younger ones are eager enough to lie down in the long grass with any Moon Maid who is willing . " <p> She sipped from the Hetman 's golden cup , carved from the skull of a clan enemy . " And what do you think ? <p> His grief-scarred face softened . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long grass with the Moon Maids  --  but I got only daughters . You might even be one of them . You have the courage for it , coming alone to an angry camp . " <p> Aganippe took this as a compliment . Moon Maids naturally fantasized about their fathers . As a girl she imagined hers to be a famous warrior , a vagabond prince , or some god 's son  --  never a nomad Hetman . <p> " But bravery is not enough . " He tilted his head toward the entrance flap , to indicate his warriors and kinsmen crowded outside . " They are brave . And could easily bring me a lion . I could even kill one myself . But I want you to bring me the lion  --  the beast that took my son and granddaughter . " <p> Aganippe nodded . " That is what I mean to do . " She was not going to kill just any lion . <p> " Then swear to it . " The Cimmerian brought out a great bowl , beaten from a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in blood from his left hand . Lifting his spear , he told Aganippe , " Give me your arm . " <p> A blood oath was totally unneeded , and none too pleasant  --  but to satisfy him , Aganippe bared her arm , holding it over the bowl . <p> The Hetman pressed the razor-edged spear point against her flesh . The spear shaft was inlaid with sea shells , but the point was a local copper-arsenic alloy . He bore down until it drew blood . Then he jabbed the weapon point first into the wine bowl . " This spear was mine , until I gave it to my son . Swear you will bring it back with his killer 's blood on the blade . " <p> Aganippe swore by the Hearth Maiden , by the Snake-tailed Mother , and by the Black-faced Mistress . Then they drank . <p> Wiping blood and wine from his lips , the Hetman added , " And do it soon . Or we will come looking for a lion . " <p> Aganippe took up the spear and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting up in his painted cart , stuffed with straw and spices , wearing his best gold-embroidered jacket  --  all set to go calling . His child-wife sat at his side , dressed in silk and ermine , looking woefully pretty , her hair combed back from her scratched face , her spirit snapped like a broken spear shaft . For the next forty days wife and corpse would go around the yurts , feasting as if he were alive . <p> The scalps overhead snapped in the breeze . Aganippe knew that if she disappointed this Hetman , he had the means to make her wish she were sharing his son 's couch in Hades . She held down another surge of anger . <p> Aganippe had lain with several young warriors , and on the whole rather enjoyed having a sturdy nomad thrusting inside her , galloping in the grass with her calves hooked behind his . But to say that if one of them died then she should be throttled and buried beside him  --  that was absurd . If this was law , Aganippe was happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water 's edge , she went over the tracks until she could see the pug marks in her sleep . Then she set out , looking for dark flecks on the grass tops of the Laughing Steppe . <p> Lions could be taken with a bow and spear . Pharaoh Amenhotep had brought down over a hundred that way . But he went out with a mob of beaters , a chariot to shoot from , and a ring of spearmen to keep the beasts off him  --  outings so ostentatious they could hardly be called hunts . Aganippe had only herself , and her mare . <p> Soon the filthy sprawling camp and its huge bleating herds were swallowed by the great dun-green sea of grass . Aganippe was alone under a sky so vast the sun seemed to shrink into blue emptiness . She could see no more than a few paces into the tall grass  --  a charging lion could cover that distance in half a heartbeat . A twitch in the grass tops would be her only warning . Nor was being mounted an advantage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet . <p> Hearing was her best defense . That man-eating leopard had sprung at her without a sound , but a lion usually gives a low grunt to freeze its prey . Not always though . Lions made silent charges just often enough to keep things interesting . She had managed to kill the leopard , but never a lion . <p> And this lion knew all about hunting people , having taken its prey from under the snotty suspicious noses of a thousand armed nomads . Aganippe would have to meet the beast on its own terms , or not at all . <p> Twice she spotted soft dents where the lion had set the child down , getting a better grip on its kill . By now the beast must have shaken the dogs . The feeding site would not be far off . <p> A little farther on she found it , a blood spattered bowl of matted grass . Aganippe dismounted , holding tight to the spear . She found a hank of honey-brown hair and some chewed bone splinters . Saying a prayer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather , stuffing it into her jacket so the Hetman could bury what was left of his granddaughter . <p> Standing up , she stared about , seeing only swaying grass tops . Her best chance of finishing this quickly was fading . Lions liked to lie up after a meal , usually close to the feeding site , fearing almost nothing and perhaps anticipating a second helping . But this meal was pitifully small , and the lion had been attacked in the act of taking it . No reasons to linger . And now there would be no blood spoor to follow . <p> Seizing her marc 's stiff upright mane , she swung onto her saddlecloth , making a slow circuit to pick up the trail . <p> She found a depression where the lion might have lain up . Otherwise nothing . No claw prints . No pug marks . Not so much as a scat . <p> She took her bearings from the sun , finding she was well to the west of the lagger . If this was a male on the move he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a zigzag course , casting about for sign . All she saw were hump-backed burial kurgans rising out of the dun-colored steppe . <p> Her search ended at the east bank of the Amazon , the broad gray flood cutting through the Sea of Grass between the Dnieper and the Volga , emptying into the Black Sea . Furs , gold , slaves , and amber all flowed down the Amazon , headed for sale in Sinope , Troy , and Tyre  --  maritime cities so far to the south that if you were to show a Cimmerian a ship 's oar he could not name it , or guess what it was for . <p> Lazy smoke rose from farmsteads along the river , where dutiful peat-eating peasants labored alongside their oxen . There was no reason for the lion to cross , but perhaps the beast got thirsty . The scent of the river carried for miles . She rode north , then south along the narrow bank , looking for lion sign . Finding nothing but a small cattle trail . The second time she crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand . Between the wheel marks was a bare footprint twice the size of hers . <p> The spring sun sank on the far side of the Amazon . Even if she somehow found her child-killer now , she would be no match for a lion at night . Tomorrow she would try backtracking . Getting down , she walked her horse toward the Shrine . A warm black drizzle blew up from the south , melting the last of the snow . Wet grass tops whipped at her hips . Near to dawn she heard lions calling  --  a local pride hunting . She took it as a lucky omen . <p> The Lion Shrine 's stockade and wooden tower stood tall and dark above the predawn steppe . Temple bells tinkled on the dawn wind . Walking her mare through the stockade gate , Aganippe found the rammed earth maidan nearly deserted  --  only those who cared the most had stayed up to see her safe . <p> Hippodameia , the horse tamer , fed a low dung fire , looking on as an Enaree fortune teller twisted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eohippe played with a pair of orphaned cubs , watched over by Kali , an aged lioness with a crooked front foot . Kali was too crippled and toothless to be the child-killer , though Aganippe had once seen the grim old girl gum a hapless intruder half to death . <p> Both Eohippe and Horsetamer wore stagskin pants and loose leather jackets  --  though Hippodameia was at the age when she should give up horsetaming , don a bell-shaped dress , and retire to the Inner Shrine . Only the Enaree wore full feminine attire , a tall headdress , dangling jade earrings , and a flounced skirt with a silk-embroidered bodice , padded to enhance the hips and bosom . <p> Young restless eyes saw her first . Setting down her cubs , Eohippe leaped to her feet , taking the mare 's reins and greeting Aganippe with a shy smile , offering a massage  --  " If you wish . " <p> Horsetamer called to the novice to feed and water the mare . " Give her a grass rubdown and a warm stall . I 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aganippe sat down by the dung fire . Hippodameia settled in behind her , taking hold of her tight stiff shoulders . Horsetamer knew every aching fold by heart ; as she kneaded , she called out instructions to Eohippe  --  how best to rub the mare , what sort of feed to give her , which stalls had fresh hay . <p> Horsetamer 's hands worked their way down Aganippe 's spine to the tops of her buttocks . In summers past she had given many such massages . Only then both of them had lain naked in Horsetamer 's warm loft above the stables , lulled by sunshine and the drowsy smell of green hay and horse dung . Hippodameia would press hard with her haunches , her hands stroking Aganippe 's nipples , thighs rubbing bare hips , lips nibbling at the nape of her neck , until the girl rolled over and gave herself completely . But that was summers ago . These days Horsetamer 's hands stayed on her back . <p> " How did it go ? " asked Horsetamer , her thumbs putting parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grunt , " Terrible . " <p> " How terrible ? " <p> " Someone has eaten a Herman 's granddaughter , and I lost the trail . " Botching the track was going to bring no end of trouble , starting with a hard day of backtracking on the morrow . <p> The Enaree smirked , fingering a necklace of colored Egyptian glass . " What does a nomad call it when a cow pisses on his leg ? " <p> Aganippe said nothing . Horsetamer answered for her , " What does a nomad call it when his cow pisses on him ? " <p> " A bath . " <p> Eohippe laughed , but Aganippe had heard it before . And she no longer found it funny  --  not after seeing the Cimmerian 's rage . The Lion Shrine could suffer the same fate as Artemis ' Tauric temple . Marauding Greeks fired the temple and made off with the virgin priestess , avenging some imagined insult . The Taurians had since found it prudent to placate the goddess by sacrificing any Greek landing among them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Brave Pride is at Lion 's Rest , " Horsetamer told her . " Tawny Pride has returned to the Shrine  --  they must have had a successful hunt . Dawn Pride is on the eastern steppe . Goddess Pride has not been spotted since three days ago at dusk . None were seen anywhere near the nomad camps . " <p> Aganippe nodded . Very normal . Lions were surprisingly shy around people . There had not been a killing like this since she was a girl , and that one had followed a lion hunt . The Shrine had successfully kept the peace between men and lions . <p> " We should offer up a big dawn sacrifice , " she decided , " to draw in the lions . Cyme and Phoebe can take the novices out and look for Goddess Pride . " Cyme and Phoebe were the other Moon Maids dedicated to the Shrine . " I 'll do the backtrack . " <p> Having assigned herself the hardest task , Aganippe asked the Enaree , " What does the lime bark say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strips back and forth between long delicate fingers . The Enaree 's painted lips parted , showing pearl-white teeth . " Pray to Apia . " <p> Aganippe nodded her thanks , hiding a twinge of guilt . Since girlhood she had gladly served Our Lady of the Beasts , the Hearth Maiden who presided over warfare , childhood , and the hunt . Apia , the Snake-tailed Earth Mother , was an uncomfortable reminder that maidenhood did not last forever  --  just as the Black-faced Mistress reminded mortals of death . But to Aganippe losing the freedom of maidenhood always seemed like a little death . She would rather have called on the Black-faced One . <p> Eohippe came trotting back from the stables , offering to take over the massage  --  irreparably cute and aching to be taken seriously . Horsetamer said nothing , her thumbs digging under Aganippe 's shoulder blades . The Enaree 's red grin grew into a broad smile , accompanied by an exaggerated wink . <p> How like a man , thought Aganippe . <p> No intact male could serve the Shrine . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blouse , and had hacked off his privates to please the goddess . But sex was in the head , not in testicles or face paint  --  and the Enaree saw Eohippe as pathetically available . Aganippe had only to nod and the novice would be out in the long grass , kneeling naked between the Moon Maid 's knees . The Enaree could not understand her passing that up . <p> But when Aganippe looked at Eohippe , she saw herself , six summers ago , hopelessly in love with Horsetamer . And that had ended ill . She was not a calf-stealer . Standing up , she thanked Hippodameia for the back rub , saying it was time to visit the Inner Shrine . <p> The Inner Shrine was like a burial kurgan , dug into the base of the watch tower  --  flanked by the horse stalls and sweat lodge . She entered through a narrow sloping tunnel paneled with cedar and floored with river stones ; smelling of damp earth . Accustomed to flat open steppe and towering sky , Aganippe always associated going underground with death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn duty by the altar lamps , wearing her sable robe , serpent belt , and cap of priceless sea pearls . She greeted Aganippe with a cold glare . A holy silence lay between them , but Mother had seen the massage in the courtyard . <p> Enough , thought Aganippe . What was the harm in a back rub ? With Mother , everything was suspect . Aganippe was an only daughter . Mother had borne four sons , giving them up to their fathers . Beyond childbearing , she now yearned for granddaughters  --  which Horsetamer could hardly give her . Past reproaches echoed unsummoned in Aganippe 's head . " Do you want to end up like Horsetamer ? Chasing young girls , with only aging friends and ex-lovers for company. ? " <p> Mother did not know the half of it . At Eohippe 's age , Aganippe wanted desperately to be Horsetamer  --  competent , independent , owing nothing to anyone . She had given herself gratefully to the older woman . Now she was not sure what she wanted . <p> All she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Mother nodded . As Dawn Crone she presided over that small death . " Who will you pray to ? " <p> " To Mother Apia . " Aganippe thought she detected a thin smile of triumph , though her mother tried never to let personal feelings intrude on ritual . <p> The Mother on duty woke her maiden daughter , a sleepy girl of seven . Fortunately for the girl , the Maiden 's part was minor , but Maiden-Mother-Crone  --  the three ages of women  --  had to be there for the magic to hold . To insure the Goddess was constantly served , three Maidens , three Mothers , and three Crones were always in residence at the Shrine , plus the Moon Maids , and a dozen or so girls , novices , and attendants  --  making a score of women overall . They lived off the hunt and a temple tax paid in wheat and marmot skins . <p> The women stripped her . Standing naked before the horned altar , Aganippe struggled to stay awake , murmuring prayers she had recited since girlhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth color . <p> To keep alert , she imagined her sainted mother , high priestess and seer , with her dress up , making heel marks in the sod while some passing stranger  --  perhaps a youthful version of the Cimmerian Hetman - heaved and sweated atop her . It was impossible to picture , particularly on an empty stomach . But that was where she had come from . They had Mother Apia 's word on that . Why could n't an almighty goddess have devised a more dignified way to bear daughters ? <p> They fed her honey cakes and mare 's milk , then led her naked out of the womb-like shrine . Mother put her finger to her lips , signing for everyone to observe the holy silence . <p> Knowing what would be needed , Horsetamer had stoked the fire , rolling rocks onto the coals . Using a brass dish , Eohippe and the Enaree carried the red hot stones into the sweat lodge , a skin wickiup stretched over a willow frame . Entering the lodge , Aganippe lay down beside the glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sweat . <p> Mother cast big green hemp buds sticky with resin on the rocks . The hemp burst into flames and intoxicating smoke filled the sweat lodge . Aganippe drank it in through her nostrils . Then came the water , thrown hissing over the hemp . Steam blotted out everything , a white drugged fog , filling her lungs , seeping into her pores . <p> Thoroughly exhausted , Aganippe closed her eyes , and was instantly asleep . The hemp and her lack of sleep had her dreaming almost at once . Everything from the day got mixed together . Her mother was there , as was Horsetamer , and the Cimmerian Hetman . They tried to get her to mount a bed-like funeral bier , making a place for her beside the Herman 's dead son . Mother told her , " Goddess knows , he 's not much  --  but he can give me granddaughters . " <p> " Grandsons , " the Hetman corrected her . <p> " Twins , " suggested Horsetamer . <p> Aganippe recoiled from the dead son 's ghoulish embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steppe , pursued by a huge shadowy figure . She headed for Hylaea , Apia 's wooded home . The Snake-tailed Mother came out of her tree-shaded cave , supported by twin serpent tails in place of legs . She was leading a fine pair of mares and a small herd of red cattle . " Why are you running ? " hissed Apia . Aganippe tried to explain , but the Earth Mother merely told her , " Seek the Lion Man , " pointing a scaly tail at Aganippe 's hulking pursuer . Turning about , Aganippe finally got a look at the man who was chasing her . His body was huge and handsome  --  but he had a lion 's face . <p> She awoke with an aching head . The sweat lodge was cold and empty . She wormed her way through the entrance flap , then staggered to her feet , blinded by the daylight , her body still yellow and naked , scrawled with power signs . <p> Horsetamer was waiting , with the Enaree . So was her mother and Eohippe . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly slept early in the evening , to be up at dawn with the horses . <p> " Did you dream ? " Mother asked , bringing her a basin to wash in . " More than I wanted to , " Aganippe admitted , wincing at the cold wash water , thinking about the part where they tried to mate her to a corpse . <p> Mother laid out boots , trousers , a shirt , and a red-leather jacket trimmed with horsehair . " What did Apia advise ? " <p> " Seek the Lion Man , " Aganippe replied , pulling on the stag-leather pants , hairside in for warmth . She scanned the ring of faces for signs of recognition . No one had a notion who the Lion Man might be  --  except maybe the Enaree , who smirked for a moment , then got up and left . <p> Tying off her trousers , she stood half-naked , letting the morning sun warm her wet breasts . " Have Cyme and Phoebe gone out ? " Horsetamer nodded . " They left while you slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horsetamer shook her head . <p> " Then get them ready . " Last night 's rain had drowned the scent , but gazehounds did not need their noses to hunt . She pulled on the doeskin shirt , and the red-leather riding jacket . She had been to the sweat lodge and gotten her dream . Now it was time to act . This killer needed to be brought to bay soon  --  or not at all . <p> " I have saddled four horses , " Horsetamer told her , then went off to see to the hounds . <p> Four horses meant two riders . Eohippe got up eagerly . " Take me . " The other novices were off with Cyme and Phoebe , searching for Goddess Pride . <p> Aganippe struggled into her boots , then went to inspect the horses . Eohippe tagged hopefully after her . Horsetamer had saddled Aganippe 's favorite mount , a zebra dun , with dark stripes on her legs and withers , also a big clayback gelding , and a pair of roans . The blaze-faced roan was Horsetamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror case on the mare , she mounted the big gelding , meaning to keep her best horse fresh . <p> Horsetamer returned with the hounds  --  a half-dozen lean powerful creatures , with long legs and deep chests , bred from Abyssinian wolves , and perfect for hunting in open steppe where prey can not be stalked and must be caught . Their eyes were as keen as a bloodhound 's nose , and they could run down the fleetest prey , turning , dodging , able to out-distance a cheetah if the need arose . She cinched their feed bag behind her . <p> Taking up the Herman 's spear , she told Horsetamer , " I wo n't need the roans . " <p> Eohippe 's face fell . Horsetamer handed up the mare 's drag rope . Their fingers touched . " You should not go looking for this lion alone . " <p> " Oh , I 'm not alone . " The Moon Maid shook her head . " I have the dogs . And Mother Apia will be with me . " Horsetamer looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face down this lion on her own , with the least amount of helpful interference . An only daughter , she had been brought up to rely on herself  --  it was too late to change that now . The Enaree ambled up , bidding her to wait . <p> " You too ? " Aganippe raised an eyebrow . The transvestite 's dress was not even slit for riding , She might as well take Mother . <p> He-she laughed . " Oh , no . The lime bark says this is going to be far too adventurous . But I have something you 'll need . " The Enaree held up an evil-looking goatskin bag tied together by the hooves . It smelled of wine . <p> Aganippe tried to refuse . " I wo n't be drinking . " <p> " All the better , " replied the Enaree . " It 's not for you . " <p> She shrugged and took the goatskin , wondering how wine was going to help her find her lion . But the Enaree had the farsight  --  and was tolerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitch , a hound named Havoc . They all had fast , easy-to-call names , like Hasty , Blazer , Ripper , and Impulse . Then she set out through the stockade gate , with the pack trotting at her heels . A hot wind blew up to meet her , making it hard to believe that three nights ago it had snowed . <p> She swung wide to check on the prides . Tawny Pride was scattered south of the Shrine , sleeping off their kill . The dawn sacrifice of a fat bullock had brought Brave Pride in from Lion 's Rest . And on the eastern steppe she met up with a pair of lionesses from Dawn Pride , Eos and Daybreak , along with a young male named Helius . Only Goddess Pride had not been heard from  --  but it was up to Cyme and Phoebe to find them . <p> When she got to the kill site , the wagon lagger was gone . But the Cimmerians had not headed back to the north country  --  no such luck . Their yurt tracks went west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run over the blood spoor and lion prints , so the pack would know what they were after . Then they set out upstream , looking for some sign of where the lion had come from . Cats are territorial creatures . The lion was apt to circle back . Or Aganippe might get some clue as to the killer 's identity . <p> But all she saw was mile after mile of empty stream mud . Disheartened , she struck out over the steppe . By now the sun was high up , and the vast grassy plain seemed nine parts sky . Herds of red deer and antelope grazed in the distance . The only lion sign she spotted was a rest , where a traveling pride had stopped to sleep out the day . Which pride it was , she could not say . Suddenly the dogs began jumping about . Havoc loped off , then came racing back . Aganippe loosed the pack , to see what they had found . <p> It was another kill site . Grass had been torn and trampled in a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great red cow or ox . Horns , hooves , tendons , hair and scraps of hide were strewn all about . Lions had been feeding . Hyenas too  --  their white dung was everywhere . Vultures stalked in and out of an empty rib cage . <p> Getting down on her knees , Aganippe reconstructed the kill . It was the work of a fair-sized pride . The lions had surprised a small herd of cattle , cutting out a single victim . The terrified beast had spun back and forth , trying to shake its tormentors . Working together , the lions kept the ox boxed in , finally managing to bring it down . <p> But the pride had paid for its meal . One of the lions was hurt , and lay on its side for some time , then limped off ahead of the hyenas  --  favoring its left forepaw . <p> The dogs began leaping about again . Aganippe looked up . A slow lurching movement caught her attention . A two-horse chariot was coming toward her over the steppe , with no horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standing up , she saw the chariot was being pulled by a man , plodding purposefully along with the chariot pole across one shoulder . Despite the weight of the chariot , the man kept up a steady ground-eating pace , as though he had come a long way , but would keep on walking until he got where he was going . He was a big black-bearded titan , stark naked from the chest down , carelessly swinging a brass bound club in one huge hand . He wore nothing but a giant lionskin cloak , with the forepaws draped over his shoulder , and the tail and hindpaws dangling behind him . The lion 's maned head formed a hood , framing the man 's face with its grinning teeth . <p> The Lion Man Never having seen the like , the Moon Maid watched man and chariot lurch toward her . Her hounds ran out to meet the intruder , but the man barked at them and they came bounding back . <p> At the edge of the kill site he set down the chariot pole , stepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his lion skin , he stood over four cubits barefoot . Aganippe had seen taller men  --  though not by much - but never anyone bigger . He had arms as thick as her thighs , and legs like temple pillars . Eohippe could have lain across his chest and shoulders , with only her head and toes showing . His eyes were light amber , like a lion 's . <p> Giving Aganippe a jaunty greeting , he claimed he was a god-son and that his name was Hercules . <p> " I saw the vultures circling and came right over . " He professed an affinity for vultures . " They are always a lucky omen , being the most pious of birds , never harming anything living . " <p> Aganippe had seen vultures do a good deal of harm to things that had not yet managed to die , but she sensed this was not the time to argue ornithology . <p> Hercules shook out a short doric tunic that had been folded on his shoulder to pad the chariot pole . He pinned the simple square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the waist with a length of rope , leaving the right side open . The lion tail dangling between his legs was knotted in the middle . <p> " Have you seen my chariot mares ? " he asked . " A matched pair , given to me by Poseidon . " <p> Aganippe told him she had not seen any god-given horses . <p> " Then how about the cattle of Geryon ? Big red shambling beasts - very beautiful ? " Without waiting for an answer Hercules launched into the tale of how he had lifted the cattle from King Geryon of Tartessus who lived at the far end of the world , beside the Ocean stream . Or rather had lived . Hercules had been forced to kill King Geryon , along with the king 's herdsman and a wondrous two-headed watch dog . <p> He had been ordered to commit this larceny and homicide by the High King of Mycenae , a Greek with no particular claim to the cattle , who was in the habit of sending Hercules hither and yon to lift or kill all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight-headed hydras to kill , stables to clean  --  it made no difference to Hercules . The harder the better . <p> " All that matters to me is that this is my tenth and last labor . Drive these wandering cattle down to Mycenae , and I 'm done  --  when I find them . " <p> " You 've found one , " Aganippe held up a scrap of hide from the kill site ; long red hair still hung from it . <p> Hercules swore mightily  --  not a formal oath , but a string of Greek expletives . Listening to him , Aganippe could hardly believe Mother Apia would saddle her with this ox-sized oaf . But who else could this be but the Lion Man ? Fit punishment for clinging stubbornly to maidenhood . <p> " There is nothing to do but search for the others , " Hercules decided . Seizing the drag rope on her gelding , he hauled the big clayback over to his chariot . Without so much as a " by-your-leave " he was appropriating her horses . <p> Aganippe went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and helping secure both horses in the traces . Even on short acquaintance she guessed that quibbling over ownership with Hercules was a good way to end up as dead as Geryon and his two-headed watch dog . Besides , having no notion where her lion had gone , it would be plain idiocy to deny an omen from Mother Apia , no matter how unpleasantly packaged . <p> Hercules made room for her aboard the chariot , which was loaded with a pair of bows and a collection of oversized armor  --  gifts from various gods . <p> " Apollo gave me the bows , and Hermes the sword . The helmet , cuirass , and shield are all Hephaestus ' work , totally unbreakable . Ca n't imagine why they thought I would need them . Mostly sentiment , I suppose  --  wanting to see me off well . We gods are greathearted to a fault . " He clearly considered himself the greatest thing since the Hittites sacked Babylon . <p> Hercules whipped her horses and they were off , following the cattle trail away from the kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but soon the little herd had bunched together again , plowing through the long leaves of grass , leaving a clear trail . If the pride came back for another taste of Geryon 's cattle , Aganippe might get a clue to her killer . <p> As they bounced along , Hercules regaled her with a description of his last and greatest labor . He had gone all the way to Spain to get the cattle , pausing to set up the pillars that marked the entrance to the Ocean stream  --  modestly naming them for his favorite deity . " Pillars of Hercules has a handsome ring , " he confessed . <p> He had returned by way of Gaul , Italy and Sicily  --  this was all undiscovered country , and Hercules was having difficulty finding his way back to Greece . " At the head of the Adriatic the herd was stampeded by a gadfly . I tracked them across Thrace to here . Then yesterday morning I awoke to find my chariot mares missing as well . A lesser god would have given up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say that . Hercules took her silence for mute agreement . <p> Musing over his lost mares put him in mind of the two horses he had taken from her . " Fine mounts  --  though not to be compared to a gift of Poseidon . But nice come upon , just when I needed a new team . " it was the first time he had shown the least curiosity about why Aganippe happened to be out wandering the steppe . She told him about her lion troubles , ending with her most recent conclusion  --  that the child-killer with a crooked foot had been lamed by his lost cattle . <p> Hercules told her she was in luck . " You wo n't find a mightier lion-killer . " He boasted that before he was out of his teens he had killed the lion of Cithaeron  --  " Taking time out from the hunt to deflower the fifty daughters of King Thespius . A greater task than any ten lions . " In fact , he feared he might have missed one of the daughters , lying with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The main drawback to mass deflowering is the tendency to lose count . You end up relying on a bunch of giggling virgins to keep track . " <p> He had killed another memorable lion near Thebes , but the pelt on his back came from the Nemean lion . " Whose skin was proof against stone , iron , or bronze . I had to strangle him barehanded  --  costing me a finger . " <p> Hercules held up his left hand as proof . The little finger was bitten off just above the knuckle . " Lions are nothing . " <p> Not to Aganippe . For all of her life lions and horses had been just about everything . Now she had lost her horses to this big buffoon  --  and she still had a lion to kill . <p> Hercules sensed he had not cheered her . " Really , I will kill your lion . Throughout my labors , I 've taken on extra tasks  --  to show the King of Mycenae he does not own me . I subdued Gaul and Thrace , and sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleece , if Calais and Zetes had not talked Jason into abandoning me . " <p> The cattle trail led south , past humped burial mounds covered over with wild wheat and blue coneflowers . At dusk , Aganippe made out a thin dark line in the distance . " That is the forest of Hylaea , " she told Hercules , " Mother Apia 's sacred wood . " It was the only sizeable tract of woodland along the lower Amazon . <p> Not even a demigod cared to track cattle through the woods at night , so they set up camp . Unhitching her mare , Aganippe went out with the dog pack , running down several hares and a big ground-dwelling bustard . She rewarded the hounds with treats from their meal bag  --  dried barley bread dipped in blood  --  keeping the kills for herself . Hares and bustards are not the best fare for gazehounds . And Hercules showed every sign of being hard to feed . <p> He started a fire , and happily gutted the kills , while Aganippe gave her horse and hounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feathers , then buried the carcass under the coals to bake . Skinning the hares , he stuck them on a spit , saying , " Today I 'm hungry . But normally I do not stoop to rabbit hunting . it is fine to hunt boars and wild bulls , or man-killing lions and wolves  --  but what harm do little rabbits do ? " <p> Hercules had discovered her wineskin , and pouring it into his empty stomach was making him tenderhearted . <p> He told her that since crossing the Amazon ( which he called the Tanais ) he was anxious to reach the next river over  --  " Which runs into the world-circling Ocean . Then I will have gone from one end of the world to the other . " <p> Here she had to disappoint him , explaining that the Volga which he called the Rha ) did not flow into Ocean , but emptied into the landlocked Hyrcanian Sea . Hercules was a long way from world 's end . <p> Hearing this , he grew morose , drinking more and musing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or just plain hated him . By his own admission , he had enemies by the score . Hera , his foster mother , hated him . Calais and Zetes got him kicked off the Argo . Complete strangers took it amiss when he came to clean their stables , lift their livestock , or just slaughter some wondrous creature that lived nearby . His own cousin , the King of Mycenae , sent him on these impossible labors . " And if I so much as stray for a moment , his herald the Dung Man appears with new demands . Bring me Aphrodite 's silver nightie , and a Moon rock for my garden , or something equally useful . " <p> Aganippe made the mistake of asking why he was put to these labors . Hercules heaved a sigh , " They are a penance . " <p> " For what ? " <p> " I killed my children . Not all of them  --  that would be impossible . Just six sons that I had by the King of Thebes ' daughter . And a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mad at the time , and mistook them for Minyans . " <p> He took several swallows of wine , which seemed to cheer him . Then he looked her over , his eyes bright and happy . " But I 'm much better now . And after we have eaten these hares we shall enjoy each other , and feel even better . " Hercules explained that he was partial to Amazons . " I prefer a woman of spirit , and have little use for law myself . I fuck when I please , and fight when I must  --  though gods and men often take it amiss . " <p> Aganippe knew she should slide gracefully out of his clutches , but she lacked the knack for fawning . Instead she said she would sooner mate with one of Geryon 's lost oxen . <p> He laughed . " Do n't be modest . I know you 've wanted me . Amazons always do . It 's my muscles . When I came to fetch Queen Hippolyte 's girdle she was in a fever to get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merest mischance that I had to kill her afterwards . " <p> Aganippe did not demand details . She sat in silence , furiously weighing her chances of surviving dinner . It was plainly suicidal to deny him anything . God or mortal . Mad or sober . Death followed Hercules about as diligently as his King 's herald , the Dung Man . He killed people in battles and single combats , as well as in athletic contests , acts of larceny , and simple drunken accidents . He killed to administer rough justice , and in contrite compensation for previous killings , also in fits of madness and chance encounters . And not just people . By his account he had killed lions , serpents , centaurs , bulls , bears , and brazen-winged birds . Not to mention titans , gorgons , three-headed shepherds and unnamed six-armed monsters . Whole districts had been depopulated , and many marvelous species turned to myth by his arrows and brass bound club . <p> Nor was Aganippe under the dangerous illusion that she had half a hope of standing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was like a force of nature , and his quiver was an open grave . She 'd have a better chance of saying " no " to a cyclone . <p> Her sole hope was that Hercules was already half shot on the Enaree 's wine , and would be slow to act . Trust a fortune teller to know what would be needed . <p> He tipped back the wineskin , wetting his beard as he drank . She leaped up and ran , sprinting over the darkening steppe like a nomad fleeing a bath . <p> Aganippe had no notion of where she was going , just aiming to be gone  --  to get lost in the long grass . It was that or end up as dead as Geryon and Hippolyte . The hounds must have thought it was a chase , because they came bounding up . She yelled for them to be gone , to go back to camp , but they kept bumping at her heels and dashing on ahead . <p> Hearing Hercules call to her , she redoubled her efforts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them frisking about ? Then she remembered the Hylaea Wood , and made for it , with the hounds pelting after her . Her best hope was to somehow lose him in the dark wood , dogs or no . <p> Something clipped her foot . She went down , sure she had stumbled over a hound . But when she tried to rise , her leg would not hold her . <p> " Here , let me help you . " Hercules stood over her , flushed with wine , but not even breathing hard . He had easily run her down . Jerking her to her feet , he twisted her arms behind her , binding her wrists with the rope he used for a belt . " It was foolish to run . Calais and Zetes were sons of the North Wind , but they could not outrun my vengeance . " <p> He hoisted her onto his shoulder , taking up the club he had thrown to bring her down . <p> She kicked at his head with her good leg  --  finding it as solid as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-legged ass . <p> " No need to play the coy Corinthian , " he told her , striding back to camp with the hounds at his heels . " If you have the misfortune to be a virgin , you could not hope for a better start . I never resort to rape , since women find me irresistible . Once they see there is no escape , they learn to love it , or at least stop struggling . None of King Thespius ' fifty daughters had cause to complain  --  unless it was the one I missed . " <p> Tossing her into the chariot alongside his bows and armor , he took another swig from the wineskin , then went to dig up the bustard . <p> Bent double , the Moon Maid massaged her numb leg with her bound hands . A cold dull moon drifted overhead . She prayed to it . Dying to protect her honor would help no one  --  not the Shrine , not the lions , and least of all her . But giving in to Hercules was no better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she had denied him . <p> She looked frantically about . With her hands tied and one leg lamed she had no chance to flee or fight . Her weapons were by the fire . So was Hercules ' sword . The chariot held only his armor and bows  --  and his quiver . <p> Pushing off with her good leg , she edged up to the chariot rail , where her bound hands could reach the quiver . Hercules ' arrows were inside . <p> Back by the fire , Hercules had finished the bustard and was hard at work on the rabbits . Between bites he regaled Aganippe with tales of his conquests  --  each exploit reminding him of another . Well into his cups , he had trouble telling myth from legend . The Lernaean Hydra now had nine heads , one of them immortal . The fifty nights he spent with King Thespius ' daughters became a single dusk to dawn debauch . <p> Her own debauch was moments away  --  but mention of the Hydra reminded Aganippe that the arrows were dipped in the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidents had concerned a thumb-fingered centaur who scratched himself handling Hercules ' arrows  --  dying in unspeakable agony . Muttering a prayer to the All Mother , she slowly drew an arrow out . If Apia meant for her to die , it might as well be now . <p> Reversing the arrow , her hands crept down the shaft to the point , her fingers closing on the head . Holding it sideways , she sawed at the rope , knowing a single prick would end all her troubles . <p> A heavy hand shook the chariot . Her fingers froze , and she looked up . Hercules stared down at her , grinning so wide she could count his teeth . " What are you doing ? " <p> " I 'm patting myself in the hands of the Mother . " She felt the rope part behind her . <p> " Oh , it wo n't be that bad , " he assured her . " But do eat first , you 'll want the energy . " Hercules had saved the last hare for her  --  undersized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She turned her head away . " I 'm hardly hungry . " <p> Hercules shrugged and took a bite himself , spitting out small bones , saying she was not entering into the spirit of the evening . He strolled cheerfully back to his fire and wineskin . Had he not been maudlin drunk , he might already have made swift work of her . <p> She let the arrow fall , rolling off the tail of the chariot . One leg was still dead weight , but she pushed herself into the grass with her good one , wriggling away from the bright circle cast by the fire . When she lost sight of the fire , she had to take her bearings from the stars . Finding the Great Bear , she kept the North Star over her shoulder , crawling toward the wood , impossibly far off but still her only shelter . <p> A bellow came from behind her . She dived down beneath the grass stalks . Hercules had found the chariot empty , reproachfully calling her name . Aganippe was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grass , calling as he came . " Come , enough of this nonsense . I 've eaten and am ready for bed . " <p> She burrowed deeper , down to where the grass roots trap wet warm air . Closing her eyes , she laid her cheek against the earth , listening to his footfalls getting closer . She could hear him thirty paces off . Then twenty . Then ten . Then two . <p> He was close enough to touch . Holding her breath , she heard him muttering at the unreliability of women  --  " Always about and underfoot , except when you want one . " <p> Hercules stepped closer , his bare foot coming down between her head and her hand . Another drunken lurch and he would be on her . He sniffed aloud , like a male lion searching for the scent of a lioness . She prayed again to Apia . <p> His voice boomed over her . " You 'll catch your death in this wet grass . Let me warm you . " <p> " Hercules . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark wind like some lost ghost . " . . . Mighty Hercules . " <p> She felt him stiffen . " What ? Where ? " he demanded . <p> " Here , Hercules . " The words were somewhere between a whisper and a moan  --  but it was a woman 's voice , as clear as a night bird , with a hint of longing , a touch of anticipation . <p> " I 'm coming , " he bellowed . The leg next to her head took off , headed south . His footfalls faded rapidly , along with the voice calling his name . <p> Aganippe released her breath , daring to move again . Drawing herself into a ball , she began to rub feeling back into her numb leg . Now she was utterly alone . Without food . Or weapons . Barely able to crawl . In splendid shape to tackle a lion . <p> Nor was that the worst . What came next would be up to the vengeful Hetman and his merry band of Cimmerians . He would sack the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  if she had not already been beaten to pulp for refusing rape . Night chill crept down the grass stalks , invading her nest . Tired of kneading her leg , she slept . <p> Near to dawn she was awakened by a stiff warm body nuzzling up to her . She nearly shrieked , thinking Hercules had her . But the body was smaller than her , and another was behind her as well . And at her feet , and above her head . The dogs had found her . They were not used to sleeping without human companionship . At the Shrine each hound had a girl or novice to sleep with  --  to keep mange and worms from spreading through the pack . They had cast about in the darkness until one stumbled on her , then cuddled as close to her as they could . <p> She drifted off again . <p> " Wake up . The sun is high . " <p> Aganippe jerked alert , giving a strangled gasp . She was still lying in a tangle of dogs , but sunlight streamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hercules stood over her , like some huge waking nightmare , looking offensively cheery . <p> " Breakfast is ready . Time to eat and break camp . " He was happily holding up " breakfast , " a dead cobra , thick as her arm and dangling almost to the ground , with enough venom in its fangs to drop a charging rhino . <p> Warily she tested her leg , finding it would hold . <p> Hercules was in his normal asinine good humor . Making no reference to last night 's attempt at rape and mayhem , he launched into another of his never ending stories , telling how the cobra had foolishly crawled under his lionskin as he slept , looking for warmth . <p> " The snake did not know that I strangled cobras in my crib . When I was only eight months , or maybe a year . Two of them . Sent to kill me by some jealous god or goddess . Or maybe my stepfather . " Even as a toddler , members of his family had been hoping to rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet , following him back to camp , her dogs bounding along beside them . Hercules had a fire going , and merrily cut chunks off the cobra , sliding them onto his spit . <p> " Did you hear her ? " <p> " Hear who ? " Snake sizzled on the fire . <p> " The woman or goddess who called my name . I spent half the night searching for her . But females can be damned elusive in the dark . " He stripped steaming meat from the spit with bare fingers , making room for more . <p> " It was Mother Apia . " Aganippe tasted the cobra , finding it surprisingly succulent , barely remembering when she had last eaten . " Hylaea is her wood . " She nodded at the dark line at the southern edge of the steppe . <p> Wiping greasy fingers on his thighs , Hercules told her , " Cook the rest of this cobra , while I harness the horses . We shall see about these woods . " <p> She was no longer surprised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had stolen her horses , tried to assault her , and all but broken her leg . What really amazed her was that some irate victim , relative , or stock owner had not put a spear through him ages ago . The answer of course was that hundreds , even thousands had tried , with small sign of success . <p> Well , all she wanted was her lion . The gods could have the thankless task of putting an end to Hercules , or at very least mending his beastly manners . She whistled up the pack , and they set out , chewing on roast snake . <p> The cattle trail led straight to the woods . Hercules tethered the chariot to one of the first trees , a dwarf almond at the edge of the steppe , then they entered the holy wood , looking for cattle tracks on the forest floor . Here the rolling steppe had turned hilly , trapping water , allowing the trees to grow . The forest got darker and thicker . Dwarf almond and wild apple gave way to stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad stream the hounds stopped and lifted their heads , looking about . Wind rustled the upper branches . <p> Aganippe heard a low moaning , " Hercules . Hercules , come here . I want you . . . " <p> " Hear that ! " Hercules boomed . <p> She nodded , shifting her spear . The words seemed to come from rising ground to the right . They set off after the sound . <p> Dense thickets along the stream gave way to open parkland , beneath a wide oak canopy . Through the gnarled limbs Aganippe saw two great rounded folds of earth , with a dark cleft between them , topped by a tuft of trees and brush . It did not take any imagination to picture rounded thighs flanking a stone slit , topped by thatched pubes  --  Mother Apia 's grotto . <p> The wind sighing Hercules ' name issued from the gap between the two hilly thighs . Aganippe knew enough of caverns to guess this was completely unnatural . Breezes do n't blow out of caves , since the air underground is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to obnoxious god-sons either . <p> Telling the hounds to wait , she followed Hercules into the dark stony womb . <p> The cavern sloped downward past walls smoothed over with plaster , like corridors in an underground palace . The rocky floor turned into flagged stonework . Ahead she could see the glow of lamplight , falling on a fresco of griffins grappling with lions . Along with the light came the splash of water on stone , the whisper of invisible servants , and the strumming of a lyre played by phantom fingers . <p> The passage opened on a handsome Megaron , a temple hall supported by tall round columns . A basin and fountain faced a lively mural of mares giving birth . In the center lay a circular stone hearth , glowing with coals . Otherwise the hall seemed bare , with no stands of weapons , no stools , no cedar chests . None of the gold bric-a-brac great lords display to impress their guests . <p> At the far end of the hall , Mother Apia sat waiting on an ivory couch trimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a jar of wine and a bowl of sweetmeats . Apia looked just like she had in Aganippe 's dream . She had the head , arms and torso of a woman , a strikingly beautiful woman , with wide hips , proud round breasts , a finely chiseled face , and midnight black hair  --  but her legs from the thighs down were long serpent tails that twined about the flagstone floor . <p> Behind her stood a stock pen and stalls containing a small herd of shambling blood-red cattle , and a pair of fine chariot mares with speed stamped on every line . <p> Aganippe prostrated herself before the Mother . <p> Hercules gave a happy snort , having lost none of his usual strut and swagger . He told the goddess , " I 'll trouble you for those mares and cattle , " not in the least daunted to take on Mother Apia in her own den . <p> " You may have them , " Apia replied , " if you are man enough . Are you as mighty in the simple things as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I can spit straight and fast like thunder , if that is what you mean . " <p> Mother Apia took the tips of her tails and ran them over the curves of her torso . " If you have the strength and daring to get me with child , you can have your cattle and horses . " <p> For once he looked taken aback , staring at her two slithering tails . Apia laughed , mocking him the way he had mocked Aganippe . " Do n't be modest . You know you 've wanted me . " <p> Hearing his own words thrown back at him , Hercules recovered some of his accustomed bluster , saying , " It is my last labor , and I dare anything . " <p> Aganippe stayed prostrate before the snake goddess , mildly disgusted by the divine flirtation , but glad to see some of the brag and bounce taken out of Hercules . <p> Apia turned to her , touching the tip of one tail to her lips . " Welcome , my wayward maiden daughter  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are a disobedient child , willful to an extreme . " <p> With her nose pressed to the floor , Aganippe apologized , telling the goddess she did not mean to be wayward , or disobedient . <p> " Then you must learn to accept life , " Apia warned her . " You grow up . You grow old . And you die . Do not deny it . " <p> " I do not deny it , " she replied . <p> Apia seemed appeased . " You brought me the Lion Man . In return I will guide you to your lion . Follow the stream that runs before this cave , and you will find what you seek . " <p> Aganippe thanked the Snake-tailed Mother , gladly backing out of her presence . She was never at her best underground , and she had no desire to witness the divine mating . As she left the cave she felt the ground shake with their coupling . <p> The pack gathered around her , giving her trusting looks , expecting her to make some sense out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the grotto . In dense woods gazehounds would only be a hindrance . She took a deep breath . Her lamed leg started to hurt . Bending down , she gave it a good rubbing , then set out . <p> She had hardly gone fifty paces downstream before she spotted the first pug mark on the far bank , crisp and recent , hours old at best , and splayed to the outside . <p> Seeing that crooked pug mark appear again after so much fruitless searching was like magic , as eerie as anything she had witnessed in Mother Apia 's cave . The Snake-tailed Mother had brought all the threads together . Her new lover , Hercules . His god-given mares and Geryon 's red cattle . And now her lion . Such was the way of the Mother , Aganippe thought , sending us forth from the womb , then gathering us back to her when we are done . <p> The ground beneath her rippled again , twitching like a horse 's pelt on a hot day . Time to stop gawking at fate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the far bank , parting the leafy tangle with her spear , keeping her body low , eyes searching for lion-spoor , feeling the natural claustrophobia of a plains dweller confined by trees and brush . As she advanced , the prints grew freshet . She came upon trodden stems still in the act of bending back toward the light . From up ahead came a low undulating call of a lion . <p> The ground gave another sideways lurch . Apia and Hercules were hard at work , having a heroic coupling . <p> A light breeze rustled the branches , bringing the unmistakable smell of cat . Her belly tightened and her heart pounded . The killer was nearby , maybe just beyond the next thicket . She stopped to unsling her bow and peel off her leather jacket , lest it catch on a branch . She had to do her thinking now , because a lion charge from close in was nothing but a tawny blur , over in an eyeblink . <p> Selecting her sturdiest , straightest arrow she entered the brush with her bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grip . <p> That way she could get off one shot just by easing back and releasing . Then she would drop the bow and be ready with the spear . <p> A sharp warning cough sounded somewhere ahead of her , but she was able to see no more than a pace or two into the bracken . She slid forward , peering over the tip of her arrow , knees bent , keeping low . The best place to hit a charging lion was in the chest . <p> Two steps . Three . Then four . Nothing . Her leg began to throb again . At ten paces the birch thicket gave way to a grassy glen , filled with shifting patches of shade and sunlight . <p> Then she saw her . A dozen paces away a big lioness lay resting in the shady lee of a wild apple tree . Their eyes met . Instantly they recognized each other . Aganippe 's heart sank . <p> Without lowering her bow she called softly to the lioness , " Goddess , where have you been ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at the arrow . Goddess was the lead female of Goddess Pride  --  a friend and companion ever since Aganippe was old enough to mix with the lions . They had played and hunted together . Kali , the old lioness at the shrine , was Goddess ' mother . <p> The Moon Maid took another step , leaving the shelter of the thicket , saying in a low even tone , " Have you hurt your leg ? " <p> She was answered by a snarl  --  not from Goddess , but from another unseen lion somewhere to her left . Her bow stayed frozen , the arrow unwavering . At best she would get one shot , and she did not mean to waste it . <p> Another sinister rumble came from her right . Aganippe kept her gaze fixed on Goddess , taking another step . " Come on honey , let 's see your foot . " <p> She was answered by a low rustle . One by one members of Goddess Pride came flowing out of the shadows . Aganippe recognized Hera , Rhea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in residence , Eros and Ganymede . <p> Goddess yawned , stretched , and got to her feet . Shaking herself , she came limping over to greet Aganippe . The wound on her left foreleg was still fresh . Skin and muscle had been ripped almost to the bone by a horn from Geryon 's red cattle . <p> The gaping tear told her whole story . Lamed and separated from her pride , she had swung by the nomad camp to grab an easy meal , picking the child because she was simple to carry . The Hetman 's son had been a mere annoyance , neatly disposed of . Neither meant anything . They were strangers to the pride and Shrine . Now Goddess was on the mend , and back with the pride . All was well with her world . <p> Tears welled up . Aganippe had to blink to keep her eyes from blurring . Goddess had merely made the best of a bad business , taking what she needed , then moving on . From her friendly attitude it was clear she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt more kinship with this pride than with a pack of bothersome Cimmerians who treated her sex like dirt . She thought of the Hetman 's woeful , winsome daughter-in-law sitting on the death cart , waiting to be strangled just to adorn her husband 's funeral . Goddess had killed for food , not for vanity  --  yet the Hetman would call what he did piety , and what Goddess did murder . <p> Aganippe blinked again to clear her vision . Heaving a sigh , she pulled back on the intake , releasing on the exhale . Her shaft shot the short distance between them , hitting the lioness in the right eye . <p> Goddess had no time to dodge , or even see the arrow coming . She collapsed in a heap , the point driven deep into her brain . <p> Consternation swept the pride . Lionesses sank down , growling , tails lashing back and forth . ' With no time to nock another arrow ; Aganippe dropped her bow , holding the spear in front of her . <p> One of Goddess ' sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer , worming toward her through the low grass . So did Devi , another litter mate , advancing from the other side , hugging the ground . Ganymede and Eros , the males , were up on their haunches raising an awful racket - but it was the females she had to fear . In confrontations with humans , lionesses were the most likely to charge . <p> Aganippe took a step backward , then another , hoping to ease out of the confrontation . <p> No good . Hera matched her pace for pace , giving off low growls , her tail lashing . Lions use their tails to balance a charge . Hera 's tail swayed once . Twice . Like a cobra about to strike . When it went stiff and straight , the lioness would be on her . <p> Aganippe swung her spear about to point it at Hera . Lions will bluff charge to chase off humans or hyenas  --  but even the cat itself can not always tell when a bluff becomes real . <p> Out the corner of her eye , she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She and Hera had cooperated as coolly as they did on a hunt . Hera holding her attention , until it was too late . Devi making the classic charge , tail high , claws out , teeth bared . <p> She swung her spear , but Devi was already inside her guard . For a frozen instant the lioness seemed to hang in midair , while the spear turned slowly toward her . Then the beast came crashing past the point , smashing into her . <p> " It 's over , " she thought , as the ground hit her from behind , knocking the breath out of her . <p> Devi was on top of her , trying to get her jaws past the spear which was somehow wedged between them . Another lion had a hold of her booted foot . <p> Kicking and struggling , she shortened her grip on the spear , trying to twist the point about  --  but it was too late . Devi was blindingly fast . Sinking her teeth into Aganippe 's left shoulder , she shook the Moon Maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ euphoric complacency , like lying drugged in the steam bath . Being eaten alive did not hurt near as much as people supposed . Numb to pain , she had only a nagging feeling that all was not right . <p> Without warning the fury subsided . Devi ceased clawing and biting , collapsing on top of her in a kind of limp hug . Half-blinded by her own blood , Aganippe could not see what happened , but the rest of Goddess Pride vanished , their snarls dying in the distance . She lay on her back , bleeding comfortably , with only the limp Devi for company . An utterly unexpected end to the attack . <p> A huge hand reached down , lifting Devi off her . Hercules again stood over her , looking fit and relaxed after his triple bout of lovemaking . " Which one is your lion ? " <p> Aganippe stared up at him , still in her pleasant dream state , wondering why the big oaf was bothering her . <p> " Which lion were you supposed to kill ? " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demeter were dead , shot down with Hercules ' hydra-poisoned arrows . What remained of the pride had scattered into the thicket . She hardly knew what to think . Someone she considered at best a murderous buffoon had slaughtered her childhood companions , and saved her life . <p> " Which one ? " he demanded . <p> Shock wore off . Her wounds turned excruciatingly painful . She managed to point at Goddess , lying atop her crooked leg with the arrow through her eye . <p> Hercules picked up the spear and stuck it into Goddess ' chest . The lioness must have weighed as much as he did , but he hoisted her on the spear , slinging her over his shoulder . Then he turned back for Aganippe , who was almost delirious with pain . <p> She was amazed to see him lift his tunic hem , and reach for his prick . Hercules proceeded to piss long and hard on her wounded shoulder . Aganippe tried to twist away , but she was too weak . Her face and hair were splashed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then leaned down and picked her up . She promptly fainted from the pain . <p> She awoke on the grassy steppe . Her shoulder , bound with strips of fabric , felt like it was on fire . Her horses were hobbled nearby , cropping the grass . Her hounds were frisking about . Hercules had his own mares hitched to the chariot . A snow white mule and a small herd of red cattle rounded out the menagerie . <p> There were men around her as well  --  not just Hercules but a handsome young man in a travel-stained tunic with a leather bag slung over his back . And an older man in a gold embroidered gown carrying a caduceus , the herald 's winged staff with snakes wound about it . The mule seemed to be his . <p> Seeing she was awake , Hercules ambled over , showing her a rent in his tunic where he had torn it to bandage her shoulder . " Do you suppose you could sew this ? " <p> Lying there , weak as a hare , having been clawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake her head no . <p> Hercules sighed . " Someday I 'll learn to weave and sew . I am sure to make an exceptional seamstress . Did I tell you how I dressed my lionskin  --  even though it could not be cut with iron or bronze ? " <p> Aganippe shook her head again . <p> " I used the beast 's own claws . " Hercules beamed . " Very clever , I would say . " <p> He clapped the young man on the shoulder , introducing him as his nephew Iolaus . " He fell behind when the cattle and mares escaped . " The athletic young nephew had not been able to keep up with Hercules on foot , though he had only his kit to carry while Hercules had been dragging the chariot loaded with armor and whatnot . <p> Hercules turned to the old gentleman with the mule . " And this is the Dung Man , Copreus , the King of Mycenae 's herald , who followed the cattle trail from Thrace . He has the effrontery to tell me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dung Man gave a dignified nod . He had tiny gold-thread caducei sewn into his gown . " That is correct . His second and fifth labors are discounted . Iolaus here helped him to burn off the heads of the Lernaean Hydra , And he used the rivers Alpheus and Peneius to clean out the Augean Stables . " <p> Copreus waved his staff to indicate Geryon 's Cattle . " Did you perhaps help him to either find or herd these beasts ? " <p> Hercules roared in indignation . Ready to kill at the suggestion . " She 's been in the way since the moment we met . Teasing and distracting me . Getting lost in the night , then mauled by lions . " <p> The herald insisted on hearing it from her . <p> Aganippe shook her head , saying she had done nothing . Whatever help she rendered was more than paid for , and she did not mean to be brained for nullifying another labor . <p> Seeing the Dung Man 's disappointment , Hercules turned jovial again , lifting her up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your shrine . It is hardly out of my way , and I would hate to leave you bleeding on the steppe . " He took up the reins , happily making light of her troubles , " Truth to tell , my lot is much worse than yours . I must go back to the western end of the world and fetch the Golden Apples of the Hesperides . What is a measly lion bite compared to that ? " <p> Aganippe did not answer . Goddess 's body lay beside her , staring blankly with her one good eye . Flies crawled in and out of the spear holes . Hercules lashed his horses and they bounced off over the steppe . She fainted again from the agony . <p> Two weeks later her shoulder was still hurting . but on the mend . Aganippe was young , and never slow to heal  --  though Horsetamer assured her she would have died from septic fever if Hercules had not immediately washed her wounds . The rotting flesh beneath a lion 's claws could be as fatal as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean . <p> As soon as she could ride , she called on the Cimmerian Hetman , bringing him back his spear , along with Goddess ' tanned and salted skin , slung over a led horse , ready to go in his son 's grave . She showed him the crooked paw , and his granddaughter 's remains . <p> The long-faced Hetman sat her down in his yurt and fed her kefir , saying , " A man must not sleep under the same sky with his kin 's killer . You have spared me that shame  --  whatever I have is yours . " <p> " Anything ? " Aganippe asked . <p> " If it is mine to grant . " The old Cimmerian swore by the God of War , literally putting his life in her hands , promising to die in battle if he was foresworn . <p> " Then I want your daughter-in-law . " <p> The Hetman was taken aback . <p> " And her child as well , " Aganippe added . <p> " But she must warm my son 's bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impropriety . <p> " Does she go consenting ? " <p> " No , " the Hetman admitted . " She is a child , and does not understand why she must die . " <p> " Then it will not be much of a marriage  --  even for Hades . Give her to me instead . " <p> Remembering his oath , the Hetman shrugged . " Do you want your new thrall blinded ? " <p> " No , I will take her as she is . " <p> When her father-in-law told her what her fate would be , the girl went white as chalk , fearing that being given to the mankillers from the Lion Shrine might be worse than simple strangulation . But Aganippe promised she would not be skinned and eaten . " Nor sacrificed either  --  not to the lions at least . My mother wants granddaughters to raise . You and your little girl must do , until I am ready to have daughters of my own . " <p> She helped the girl aboard the led horse , and handed up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Turning her back on the wagon lagger , **30;939;TOOLONG set off over the Laughing Steppe , with her new-found niece and foster sister in tow . <p> <p> <p> By R.
