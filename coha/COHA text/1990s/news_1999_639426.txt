<p> There 's no question the ' Nutcracker ' is the cash cow that ballet companies everywhere turn to in the battle of the bottom line . <p> The major companies in Colorado are no exception . Whatever their circumstances , ballet company directors know that ' Nutcracker ' is very likely the first ballet any child will see . In some families this becomes a tradition , and as the children grow up and become parents , they too take their children . At last count , eight companies will give 55 performances of the ' Nutcracker ' between today and Dec. 26 . There is , in other words , no excuse not to see ' Nutcracker ' in any of several productions . <p> Most will be traditional as laid out in the original scenario devised by Marius Petipa , who choreographed the first production in St. Petersburg , Russia , in 1892 . Unlike the United States , performances of this ballet are not tied exclusively to the Christmas season in Europe and Russia . <p> The ' nut ' of the story <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Nutcracker ' extensively in its many American tours . The first American production was in 1944 , choreographed by Willam Christensen for the San Francisco Ballet . <p> The ' nut ' of ' Nutcracker ' comes from several fantastic stories devised by E.T.A . Hoffmann , who can be said to be the real-life character upon whom the role of Drosselmeyer is based . It is widely held that the phantasmagorical aspects of ' Nutcracker ' are that hormone soup called adolescence , in this case the dream of Clara , who discovers herself in that uncomfortable state between childhood and adulthood . Her desires for sweets and candy is childhood magnified ; her infatuation with the Nutcracker Prince signals her impending womanhood . <p> An ugly nutcracker <p> The story is simple enough : The time is Christmas approximately 1850 . Clara 's family has a big Christmas Eve party at which the parents tipple and flirt , and the children are entertained by life-sized mechanical dolls , the invention of Drosselmeyer . But when it comes time to give Clara her present , it is nothing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutcracker in the form of a dwarf . <p> Despite its appearance , Clara is infatuated by it and , after the party and after bedtime , sneaks down to see it under the Christmas tree . As she does so , mice pour from the walls and , led by a Rat King , attempt to harm the Nutcracker . Indeed , he and the Rat King fight one another with swords and , just when things are going poorly , Clara manages to distract the Rat , and the Nutcracker triumphs . In so doing , he is released from a curse and revealed as a handsome prince . <p> Sugarplum Fairy <p> He and Clara then venture through the woods to the Land of Sweets , where the Sugarplum Fairy welcomes them and provides divertissements for their entertainment . But as soon as the Sugarplum Fairy and her cavalier perform the grand pas de deux , Clara finds herself back home . It had all been a dream . <p> This is the gist of the story , and it is the traditional one followed by the Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aspen Ballet Company sets its production not in comfortable middle Europe , but ' in the silver boom days of the West ' with Victoriana as its style , which is entirely appropriate to its performance in the Wheeler Opera House . <p> The David Taylor Dance Theatre sets its production in the art deco era , with the mice as gangsters . It is a very different take on the story , and one that sticks . The irony is that Taylor favors modern ballet - no ' Swan Lakes ' or ' Coppelias ' for him - and never particularly wanted to do any version of ' Nutcracker . ' It was his board of directors that prevailed and his unusual look at the story that preserved his choreographic reputation . <p> Meanwhile , up in Boulder , the Boulder Ballet production could be said to be marking time until a new artistic director takes over . John Prinz will undoubtedly be shaking things up when he comes on board in January , so this may be the last time to see the show in its present shape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ana Claire and will feature Edward Stegge , late of the Colorado Ballet , as the Nutcracker Prince . <p> The Canyon Concert Ballet in Fort Collins also has a new artistic director , Robert Sher-Machherndl , who has already put his stamp on the company . Budget-minded folk might opt for the Ballet Arts Theatre 's production at Parker 's Ponderosa High School Auditorium or Denver Civic Theatre performances . Paul Noel Fiorino is the responsible party for this version with his flier announcing ' with Act 1 from Alexandre Dumas , telling how the Nutcracker came to be .
