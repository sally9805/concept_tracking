Section : B.E . SPECIAL REPORT ON SMALL BUSINESS BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES You can start a business for less than $10,000 . But it takes planning and sharp management to make it worthwhile . <p> When Sherrie Maurer made her own tomato-apple ketchup in her Vermont kitchen nine years ago , she gave it away as gifts . Then friends urged her to put it on the market . <p> Maurer was no stranger to the food trade , having worked as an inn manager and caterer , but she was n't rolling in start-up capital , either . She managed to scrape together $6,500 , mainly from her family . She called her product Beyond Ketchup , her company Jasmine &; Bread , and spent the $6,500 carefully . The first order of labels alone took $2,000 . Apples , spices , 2 tons of tomatoes , containers and shipping cases took another chunk of cash . She rented a co-op production facility and hired workers from a nearby cannery . And she got a break when eight friends volunteered to help with the first production run in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years , Maurer and her husband spent weekends driving Beyond Ketchup all over New England . " We 'd look in the phone books for country stores or specialty-food stores , " she recalls , " then go around offering to do demonstrations . " When sales could n't pay for the travel , they paid out-of-pocket <p> All that work  --  and Jasmine &; Bread grossed only $5,000 the first year . Then The New York Times featured the company in a story about a New York trade show . That led to more publicity , which Maurer used as entree into more markets , including mail order . " That story made me credible , " Maurer says . " Before that I was just this person who showed up with her condiments . It made retailers much more willing to give my product a try . I used that article for a couple of years , sending out copies with the orders I sent out so the retailers could display it . " <p> Today growing by between 20% and 30% a year , Jasmine &; Bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east of the Mississippi and on the West Coast and a " spotty but increasing " presence in the Midwest and South . The nine-condiment line includes a tomato-pear-ginger salsa ( Beyond Belief ) and a mustard ( Beyond Horseradish Mustard ) , the company 's No. 1 seller . " We 're still very small , " Maurer says . But she considers last year 's gross  --  $268,000  --  satisfactory . <p> Like 75% of black entrepreneurs , Maurer started with a dream and less than $10,000 . Sweat equity , not cash equity , tells their start-up story . But Jasmine &; Bread is just one of many successful black-owned companies that started with only $5,000 or so . As Sherrie Maurer and others have found , limited access to conventional business financing does n't have to shatter the dream . Keeping The Dream Alive <p> The U.S. Small Business Administration ( SBA ) reports that fully 7O% of all black-owned start-ups are funded from personal savings or by family and friends . Most start with less than $5,000 in working capital . For that reason , 76.1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to be more labor- than capital-intensive . The most recent ( 1987 ) Economic Censuses counted 209,547 black-owned service businesses , a full 49.4% of all black-owned firms . By contrast , only 24.6% of all small businesses are service companies . <p> The long-term profit potential in all service and retail firms is limited because the margin for error is small in thinly capitalized businesses . The SBA notes that 94% of black-owned firms are sole proprietorships , but these firms bring in only 51% of the $19.8 billion made by all black-owned businesses . A solid 39% ( $7.72 billion ) of the money that black-owned firms take in comes from the 3% of incorporated businesses that have a better survival rate than those that are not incorporated . <p> In fact , would-be entrepreneurs seeking low-cost business opportunities should remember the adage : Forewarned is forearmed . Do n't let the appealing affordability of low-investment businesses blind you to the alarmingly high failure rates of such concerns . Last year , the SBA told Congress that between 1986 and 1988 , 780,000 businesses with fewer than 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them  --  failed . During the same period , 197,000 firms with 500 or more employees were started , and 93,000 , or only 47% , of these bit the dust . Meanwhile , the number of black-owned retail firms declined by 6.5% between 1982 and 1987 . <p> Numbers like these would scare anybody , but black entrepreneurs are starting up new companies everyday . Jerry Roebuck is founder of Black Expo USA , which promotes trade shows featuring black-owned businesses in major cities . " At anytime , 50% of the African-American businesses exhibiting with us start out as mom-and-pop type operations , doing under$l million a year , " Roebuck says . " And some go on to do great things . " <p> Roebuck , who sponsored 12 Black Expos in 1992 and plans 14 for 1993 , confirms that low-investment entrepreneurs tend to be concentrated in service-oriented businesses , often run from home , " where people can start to create something themselves  --  consumable food items , T-shirts , dolls , garments . It just amazes me to see the products people fashion out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelves . " <p> Services to consumers or businesses are a logical option for entrepreneurs who ca n't afford retail inventory or massive machinery , but can travel to client locations or operate from a home office . For example , desktop publishing , medical transcription or professional billing are all services that can be provided using little more than a personal computer ( which unlike other products , has dropped in price in recent years ) and the right software . Personal fitness training , errand services , house-sitting , grocery shopping , sales of any kind  --  these are all businesses that require no special facilities , no inventory , little traditional advertising , few if any employees , and in most cases , less than $10,000 to start . " More than 50% of all service businesses , " says Arnold S. Goldstein , consultant and author of Starting On A Shoestring : Building A Business Without A Bankroll ( John Wiley &; Sons Inc. , New York ) , " offer services that only recently came into demand . " <p> In the shakiest of economies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And America 's uncertain employment picture  --  what with corporate downsizing on one hand and vanishing public-sector jobs on the other  --  is pushing more and more African-Americans toward self-employment . Between 1982 and 1987 , the last years for which figures are available , the number of black-owned firms grew by nearly 38% , while the total number of U.S. businesses grew by just over 26% . " All of our members have about the same scenario , that they started with little or nothing , " says Carl Dickerson , president of the Black Business Association of Los Angeles . " Some used credit cards to get started . But their real investment was their own energy . <p> Energy alone , of course , wo n't help you if you jump into the wrong kind of business . It takes research and planning to make a realistic match between the business you want to start and the amount of money you have available . Think ahead , not only about what your business is , does , and can bring to the market , but also about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even if you 're just beginning to save money for your start-up , start thinking of yourself not just as a self-employed person but as a business owner . The difference in thinking can affect the way you make business decisions . <p> When money is n't readily available , every available dollar and every ounce of energy and determination have to count . " Nobody is going to knock on your door , lead you by the hand , and do it for you , " says Goldstein . " Nobody is going to give you the push to get started today . " <p> One of Sherrie Maurer 's first stops was the SBA , which required her to go through a series of business seminars before it would consider her loan application . " They eventually decided that I did n't have a marketable product , " she recalls . " So they did n't back me . " The SBA banker took a second look when she raised $5,000 from her family . " He loaned me another $1,500 , figuring that if the business failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a year . <p> Getting Beyond Ketchup on store shelves was another hurdle . " In the beginning , we started trying to attract food distributors , " Maurer says . " When they asked for incentives to sell my product , I said , You mean the fact that I have a good product is not incentive enough ? ' They said no . They ask for slotting fees paid to wholesalers by manufacturers of new products , they ask for 100 free cases for promotion , they ask you to attend shows in their booth , at a cost to you . And when you 're growing a small business , it 's crazy to do that . " <p> Maurer 's response was to spend two years driving New England 's specialty-food byways . She also credits Vermont 's Department of Agriculture with sponsoring the New York trip that resulted in The Now York Times coverage . ( The department provides product testing and information to the state 's cottage industries . ) <p> Maurer got some special satisfaction in 1989 , when the SBA gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minority Small Business Person of the Year . Compensating For A Cash-Poor Position <p> " The thing that keeps most black people from taking the risk of a business , " says black business advocate Dickerson , " is that normally they do n't have enough money . They do have responsibilities . They ca n't make a commitment to the risk , and consequently rationalize to the point where they just do n't do it . " Those who have taken the risk , however , have found that business investment is often not so much a matter of how you spend , but how you structure your business and how you spend the money you have . <p> Most entrepreneurs agree that choosing the right kind of business was a big factor in their success . Successful business owners generally choose an industry they know something about . Chiquita Bell and Anita Stark chose temporary services . Bell , a legal secretary who saw well-paid temps coming and going at her Los Angeles law firm every day , had only $3,000 in the bank when she decided to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of attorneys , and she used that knowledge to focus her temporary-help service , Just Me Personnel , on those needs . Within a year , she had enough money to move out of a home office and serve her niche market from downtown . <p> Meanwhile , a few L.A. suburbs away , Stark , a 12-year veteran of GTE 's purchasing department , knew just how much money GTE spent on outside vendors . She took out a $25,000 second mortgage to start Quality Personnel , and by the end of the first year had billed $163,000 for her light industrial workers ( e.g. , general laborers , assembly line workers , packers , warehouse clerks ) . Eventually , she even got GTE as a client . Stark and Bell first connected through the California Association of Temporary Services ; by the time they merged their niche-market firms in 1991 , JM Temporary Services &; Affiliates Inc. was supplying temps for both markets all over Southern California . <p> The less cash you have , the more you 'll need industry knowledge . If you have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to manage with less cash . As Goldstein puts it , " Match the business to yourself before you match it to the market . Remember , you want a business you can enjoy , manage and earn from . " <p> The concept of image-consulting was just taking off in the mid-1980s when Toy Russell-Van Lierop went into the business . ( An image consultant can pull down $1,500-$2,500 a day by &gt; telling clients how to walk , talk and dress with style . ) A former model and national spokeswoman for Union 76 , Chevrolet and Lincoln-Mercury , Russell-Van Lierop had a background in television makeup . " I had been an apprentice at ABC in the makeup area , " she explains . " I had to learn lighting and camera techniques , and after I left ABC I got involved in makeup in the film industry . " <p> Russell-Van Lierop decided to specialize in advising on-camera talent at local TV stations . A friend at ABC recommended her for her first consultation ; word-of-mouth and Russell-Van Lierop 's reputation did the rest . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money developing the content of her service because she was expanding on what she had always done as a makeup artist . She would n't have to set up an office address because she would be consulting at client locations . But she did drop $2,000 on a top-of-the-line brochure that went to TV station managers around the country ; it included endorsements from some of the famous people she had worked with as a makeup artist . Russell-Van Lierop says that her all-time favorites  --  Joanne Woodward , Paul Newman and Halle Berry  --  " have been extremely helpful . They have recommended clients , both individually and at stations . " <p> Although Toy Russell Inc. grosses " into the six figures " these days , it was n't all uphill . " It 's extremely difficult to go into a service business , " Russell says , " and a lot of times it could be discouraging . What I am selling is myself and my expertise . The single most important thing you need is perseverance . " <p> There are many business options open to entrepreneurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible to run complex and highly professional information-age enterprises from a home-office PC : desktop publishing , computer-database research , medical transcription , bookkeeping or medical-dental billing . But each of these businesses has different staffing requirements , client expectations , billing practices and growth patterns . The time you take to understand them today will help you make informed decisions on them tomorrow . <p> One research option is to exchange work for knowledge . " Find someone who is already doing the business and volunteer your services to them , " Dickerson suggests . " If I wanted to go into the insurance business , I might want to work for an insurance broker , helping him get leads by phone . " To some people , that kind of sweat equity may be a raw deal . But from a business-investment standpoint , it makes more sense to part with time than with cash . <p> If money is really tight , Dickerson advises , try to ease your way toward entrepreneurship . " Start part-time , " he says , " creating a transition bridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Accumulate sick time , vacation time , a leave of absence and couple that with savings . And if you can , get into a low-cost housing situation where you do n't have to worry about a lot of rent . " Consider Working From Home <p> The best way to not worry about business rent , of course , is to start a business from home . This is sometimes not just an economy measure , but a sound business decision . " Plenty of shoestring start-ups , " Goldstein says , " are nothing more than cottage industries , with industrious entrepreneurs moonlighting at a kitchen table or tinkering in the basement . For some it 's the best place to start . " <p> Apparently , according to New York-based LINK Resources , about 10 million people who have established full-time self-employment at home agree . The Census Bureau reports that 54% of African-American entrepreneurs surveyed operated businesses from home . And according to Paul and Sarah Edwards , the authors of Working From Home ( Jeremy P. Tucker Inc. , Los Angeles ) , 600,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , contributing to a 12% increase in the total number of home workers . <p> Goldstein goes so far as to say that spending money on a business address may actually be a bad financial move in the early phase of operation . " You may not need a physical plant to put yourself in business , " he says . " In fact , you may be better off without it , by buying or subcontracting what you plan to sell . Many start-ups look at their business idea as essentially a production activity . They overlook the common reality that it 's more of a marketing activity , with production better left to someone else . " <p> There are plenty of resources available to entrepreneurs who want to establish business operations at home . For example , for a $75 membership fee , the Darien , Conn. - based American Home Business Association offers such services as a professional advisory hotline , a comprehensive group insurance plan and a buying service that offers savings on office equipment and other products . ( For tips on equipping your home-based business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tech Watch , January 1992 ) . And books such as Home Business-Big Business : How To Launch Your Home Business and Make It A Success by Mel Cook ( Collier , CollierBooks , New York ) , provide information on everything from choosing the right type of business to run from your home to legal advice for home-based entrepreneurs . <p> Russell-Van Lierop ran her practice from a home office for the first five years . Earlier this year , she leased a small office in Manhattan when she began to attract the corporate clients who now account for 25% of her business . What she did spend money on was an answering service . " I do n't use a machine , " she says . " In this business , it 's important for callers to hear a human voice . " <p> Jasmine &; Bread started on a home-kitchen stove . Not long after the first production run of Beyond Ketchup , for which she rented canning facilities short-term , Maurer enlarged her kitchen and brought it up to restaurant code so she could do small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she recently took an important money-saving stop by farming out production to what 's known in the specialty-food trade as a co-packer . " You sign a contract with them , you give them your recipes , you oversee them , " she says . " But they can produce larger quantities than I can , at a cheaper price . They are able to buy produce and glass at a cheaper rate . " <p> Warren Dobson became an unemployment statistic in 1991 when the Chicago company he worked for  --  a supplier of McDonald 's Happy Meal containers and toys  --  merged with another company and dumped staff . He 'd saved some money and had thought about manufacturing Afrocentric drinkware . His first product was the Kente Kup , a plastic tumbler imprinted with the pattern of kente cloth , a hand-woven fabric from Ghana . But Dobson did n't go out and buy a factory or even rent one . He comparison-shopped among vendors he had worked with . <p> " I came up with artwork and went to cup suppliers , one a silkscreener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One would go as low as 500 units , and the other started production at 5,000 . My initial investment was in low-volume production ( 1,000 units per design ) , which a manufacturer would normally use just to test a design . Basically I knew I would be selling at a loss , but if the design was proven , I would go into production . " <p> It was now October 1991  --  ordinarily too late to get in on Christmas-season sales . He had already spent about $5,000 to get his product to this point . But Dobson Products did n't lose a dime . When the Kente Kup 's first production run sold out in three weeks , Dobson quickly carried the kente print to a coffee mug and sports squeeze bottle . Then he added paraphernalia of the eight major black fraternities and sororities , where he merged the African pattern with the organizations ' own identification . He marketed this line to boutiques , black bookstores , gift shops and by taking booths at Jerry Roebuck 's Black Expos and at fraternity conventions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his first few months of operation . <p> His second bestseller  --  a Kwanzaa Kup , marketed to retailers through the Kwanzaa Expo in New York  --  came out in December 1991 . Within three weeks , Dobson sold 7,500 units . Initially , he projected $60,000 in first-year sales but now believes he will reach $100,000 in sales by the end of 1992 . He 's still made no plans to buy or rent a factory , but he is now hiring four people to follow up on new-order inquiries . The Challenge Of Success <p> Lack of cash can limit business potential , no doubt about it . Roebuck cites a typical case . " Let 's say a buyer from CVS a national drugstore chain wants to do a promotion with your product and wants 100,000 units to ship to all their stores . If it costs you a dollar to make your product , do you have $100,000 to take advantage of that national distribution ? I 've seen people not being in a position to take advantage of that offer . The problem is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have to have some capital available . " <p> Inability to respond to an opportunity is the worst problem a cash-poor business can have . One solution might be to take the purchase order to a bank and apply for a short-term commercial loan to finance production . Another potential solution , according to Goldstein , is to use a factoring company , " which will pay you upfront , while holding back a reserve for bad debts . " Both of these options , of course , involve expensive fees and interest charges . <p> On the other hand , failing to anticipate the need to finance a big production run is really a failure of planning , not capital . For the shoestring entrepreneur , planning must control the pace and pattern of business development . <p> Planning is essential . " Realists , " explains Goldstein , " understand and prepare for possible defeat . They objectively weigh the benefit/risk ratio of their deal and only move ahead when the possible gains outweigh what they stand to lose . " <p> Jasmine &; Bread 's Maurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much money in the bank : " When people say , If there 's anything I can do , let me know , ' ask what they can do and if they 're serious . If they are n't , the only thing they can say is no . There were times when I needed freezer space , and I was able to get it and a lot of professional services by trading or just by asking . " <p> Too many entrepreneurs skip the all-important step of writing , following and regularly refocusing a good business plan , even though this practice has proven an essential function of business survival . Some business owners assume such plans are only for strategic planners at large corporations . Others believe that developing and following a written plan is too time-consuming or restrictive . Still others feel intimidated by the prospect of having to commit their ideas to paper . <p> However , if you 're going to make a realistic case for how your business can deliver consistent profits , you have to be able to work out a plan , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and running . It does n't make sense to blow your limited , and thus valuable , start-up dollars before you 've considered all of the variables on paper especially when you consider the high failure rate of low-investment businesses . Also , a well-considered professionally done business plan can be an important key to securing additional start-up or expansion capital for your business . Developing a plan need not be intimidating . Help can come in the form of books , computer software and videos such as The BLACK ENTERPRISE Video Guide to Starting A Business . ( For more information on how to put together a solid business plan , see " A Good Plan is Key to Business Success , " November 1991 . ) <p> Dickerson is a strong believer in formal planning , even ( or especially ) for low-investment businesses . " Hire a college student or a local consultant for three or four hours to be your sounding board , " he says . " Go through the ABCs of what you are doing so that you do n't go out and make mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next thing is to develop a real , written business plan . Very important  --  it must be written . The process of doing a written business plan is a second analysis . " <p> Fortunately , a lot of analytical expertise is available , especially at Small Business Development Centers ( often situated on college campuses ) . " Forget high-priced management consulting firms like Booz , Allen &; Hamilton or Arthur D. Little , " Goldstein says . " With a phone call you can have top-notch MBA students anxious to burn the midnight oil guiding your business . " Do-it-Yourself Success <p> One tried-and-true method of saving business capital is to personally handle some tasks usually given over to CPAs or lawyers . " Federal and state agencies , " says Arnold Goldstein , " live in a world of forms . You 'll need forms for everything from obtaining a tax number to registering your business name . But you do n't need your lawyer to obtain and fill out these simple forms . " <p> People who have had to do this because they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been surprised  --  and pleased  --  to find they were up to the challenge . Warren Dobson trademarked the Kente Kup and the Kwanzaa Kup himself , just by wading through standard forms provided by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office . Maurer incorporated her business herself . " When I started as sole proprietor , I was told I needed to incorporate to protect personal from business assets . But you can do it yourself for $35 to $50 in Vermont ; fees vary from state to state . When you start with no money , that 's the only way you can do it . " <p> It 's sometimes hard to see the upside potential of a business idea that 's supported by energy , sweat equity , the kindness of family and friends  --  and no money . But others see business ownership as more than a path to financial security . As Carl Dickerson puts it , " The important thing for black people especially to understand is that in the capitalist system , an entrepreneur is the top rung of the ladder . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efforts of people who aspire to be entrepreneurs . They are the people that make the payroll . " <p> FOR MORE INFORMATION Starting on a Shoestring .
