High Tide in Tucson // A hermit crab lives in my house . Here in the desert he 's hiding out from local animal ordinances , at minimum , and maybe even the international laws of native-species transport . For sure , he 's an outlaw against nature . So be it . // He arrived as a stowaway two Octobers ago . I had spent a week in the Bahamas , and while I was there , wishing my daughter could see those sparkling blue bays and sandy coves , I did exactly what she would have done : I collected shells . Spiky murexes , smooth purple moon shells , ancient-looking whelks sand-blasted by the tide  --  I tucked them in the pockets of my shirt and shorts until my lumpy , suspect hemlines gave me away , like a refugee smuggling the family fortune . When it was time to go home , I rinsed my loot in the sink and packed it carefully into a plastic carton , then nested it deep in my suitcase for the journey to Arizona . // I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wait till morning to show my hand . I set the carton on the coffee table for my daughter to open . In the dark living room her face glowed , in the way of antique stories about children and treasure . With perfect delicacy she laid the shells out on the table , counting , sorting , designating scientific categories like yellow-striped pinky , Barnacle Bill 's pocketbook . . . Yeek ! She let loose a sudden yelp , dropped her booty , and ran to the far end of the room . The largest , knottiest whelk had begun to move around . First it extended one long red talon of a leg , tap-tap-tapping like a blind man 's cane . Then came half a dozen more red legs , plus a pair of eyes on stalks , and a purple claw that snapped open and shut in a way that could not mean We Come in Friendship . // Who could blame this creature ? It had fallen asleep to the sound of the Caribbean tide and awakened on a coffee table in Tucson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real account was the municipal sewage-treatment plant . // With red stiletto legs splayed in all directions , it lunged and jerked its huge shell this way and that , reminding me of the scene I make whenever I 'm moved to rearrange the living-room sofa by myself . Then , while we watched in stunned reverence , the strange beast found its bearings and began to reveal a determined , crabby grace . It felt its way to the edge of the table and eased itself over , not falling bang to the floor but hanging suspended underneath within the long grasp of its ice-tong legs , lifting any two or three at a time while many others still held in place . In this remarkable fashion it scrambled around the underside of the table 's rim , swift and sure and fearless like a rock climber 's dream . // If you ask me , when something extraordinary shows up in your life in the middle of the night , you give it a name and make it the best home you can . // The business of naming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our league . But our household had a deficit of males , so my daughter and I chose Buster , for balance . We gave him a terrarium with clean gravel and a small cactus plant dug out of the yard and a big cockleshell full of tap water . All this seemed to suit him fine . To my astonishment our local pet store carried a product called Vitaminized Hermit Crab Cakes . Tempting enough ( till you read the ingredients ) but we passed , since our household leans more toward the recycling ethic . We give him leftovers . Buster 's rapture is the day I drag the unidentifiable things in cottage cheese containers out of the back of the fridge . // We 've also learned to give him a continually changing assortment of seashells , which he tries on and casts off like Cinderella 's stepsisters preening for the ball . He 'll sometimes try to squeeze into ludicrous outfits too small to contain him ( who ca n't relate ? ) . In other moods , he will disappear into a conch the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immobilized by the weight // of upward mobility . He is in every way the perfect housemate : quiet , entertaining , and willing to eat up the trash . He went to school for first-grade show-and-tell , and was such a hit the principal called up to congratulate me ( I think ) for being a broad-minded mother . // It was a long time , though , before we began to understand the content of Buster 's character . He required more patient observation than we were in the habit of giving to a small , cold-blooded life . As months went by , we would periodically notice with great disappointment that Buster seemed to be dead . Or not entirely dead , but ill , or maybe suffering the crab equivalent of the blues . He would burrow into a gravelly corner , shrink deep into his shell , and not move , for days and days . We 'd take him out to play , dunk him in water , offer him a new frock  --  nothing . He wanted to be still . // Life being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick friend to cheer up , and would move on to the next stage of a difficult friendship : neglect . We 'd ignore him wholesale , only to realize at some point later on that he 'd lapsed into hyperactivity . We 'd find him ceaselessly patrolling the four corners of his world , turning over rocks , rooting out and dragging around truly disgusting pork-chop bones , digging up his cactus and replanting it on its head . At night when the household fell silent I would lie in bed listening to his methodical pebbly racket from the opposite end of the house . Buster was manic-depressive. // I wondered if he might be responding to the moon . I 'm partial to lunar cycles , ever since I learned as a teenager that human females in their natural state  --  which is to say , sleeping outdoors  --  arrive at menses in synchrony and ovulate with the full moon . My imagination remains captive to that primordial village : the comradely grumpiness of new-moon days , when the entire world at once would go on PMS alert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a wild wind , under that great round headlamp , driving both men and women to distraction with the overt prospect of conception . The surface of the land literally rises and falls  --  as much as fifty centimeters !  --  as the moon passes over , and we clay-footed mortals fall like dominoes before the swell . It 's no surprise at all if a full moon inspires lyricists to corny love songs , or inmates to slamming themselves against barred windows . A hermit crab hardly seems this impetuous , but animals are notoriously responsive to the full moon : wolves howl ; roosters announce daybreak all night . Luna moths , Arctic loons , and lunatics have a sole inspiration in common . Buster 's insomniac restlessness seemed likely to be a part of the worldwide full-moon fellowship . // But it was n't , exactly . The full moon did n't shine on either end of his cycle , the high or the low . We tried to keep track , but it soon became clear : Buster marched to his own drum . The cyclic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his true gender and the workings of his crustacean soul . // Buster 's aquarium occupies a spot on our kitchen counter right next to the coffeepot , and so it became my habit to begin mornings with chin in hands , pondering the oceanic mysteries while awaiting percolation . Finally , I remembered something . Years ago when I was a graduate student of animal behavior , I passed my days reading about the likes of animals ' internal clocks . Temperature , photoperiod , the rise and fall of hormones  --  all these influences have been teased apart like so many threads from the rope that pulls every creature to its regulated destiny . But one story takes the cake . F. A. Brown , a researcher who is more or less the grandfather of the biological clock , set about in 1954 to track the cycles of intertidal oysters . He scooped his subjects from the clammy coast of Connecticut and moved them into the basement of a laboratory in landlocked Illinois . For the first fifteen days in their new aquariums , the oysters kept right up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away in their shells , and time with their mouths wide open , siphoning their briny bath for the plankton that sustained them , as the tides ebbed and flowed on the distant Connecticut shore . In the next two weeks , they made a mystifying shift . They still carried out their cycles in unison , and were regular as the tides , but their high-tide behavior did n't coincide with high tide in Connecticut , or for that matter California , or any other tidal charts known to science . It dawned on the researchers after some calculations that the oysters were responding to high tide in Chicago . Never mind that the gentle mollusks lived in glass boxes in the basement of a steel-and-cement building . Nor that Chicago has no ocean . In the circumstances , the oysters were doing their best . // When Buster is running around for all he 's worth , I can only presume it 's high tide in Tucson . With or without evidence , I 'm romantic enough to believe it . This is the lesson of Buster , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for joy , hallelujah . Even a desert has tides .
