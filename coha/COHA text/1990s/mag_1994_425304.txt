A fateful encounter dramatically influenced the life of one of South America 's illustrious heroes of independence <p> Twice a widow and twice a marchioness , Dona Mariana Carcelen y Larrea died at age fifty-six , after having regretted all her betrayals . According to her death certificate , she passed away in Quito , on December 15 , 1861 , " with fever , having practiced all virtues , especially charity toward the poor , and lamented by almost every one . " After the death of General Isidoro Barriga , the husband she fancied , Mariana , Marchioness of Solanda and Villarrocha , had more than a decade to reminisce and regret . Some say that each day she wept at the grave of Field Marshal Antonio Jose de Sucre , her first husband , the great man she had reluctantly accepted . Some pronounced the last years of Mariana 's life so exemplary that God could not but grant her forgiveness . <p> Others among her contemporaries reacted differently . Gossip , constant reminders of her rebellious youthful behavior , and accusations of adultery  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those who considered Sucre , the Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho , a flawless man , could neither forgive the marchioness her love affair with General Barriga , nor forget her indifference to Sucre 's legacy . <p> Even today , the marchioness continues to be compared unfavorably to the Libertadora Manuela Saenz , Simon Bolivar 's steadfast lover . Their lives have an important epoch in common : Both women were in Quito in 1822 , when Sucre defeated the Spaniards in the Battle of Pichincha and Bolivar entered the city in triumph , and both were loved by the two eminent liberators of their time . In every other aspect , however , their lives were different . Manuela , the illegitimate daughter of a Spaniard and a Creole , had survived a difficult childhood . As she grew up , she displayed much wit , read the classics faithfully , and possessed enough courage , loyalty , and integrity to last her through the upheavals of her life with Bolivar , to whom she remained faithful to the end . The wealthy marchioness , however , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the mark of vulgarity stamped on her person ; she boasted intellectual shallowness as her main merit and folly as her stigma . " <p> Mariana was born in July 1805 to Dona Teresa Larrea and Don Felipe Carcelen y Sanchez Orellana , the seventh Marquis of Solanda and the sixth Marquis of Villarrocha . Although the Carcelen family had always been wealthy , their claim to nobility was , at best , recent . Neither the first Marquis of Solanda nor his immediate relatives had children . During several generations , the title passed to nephews and nieces until it was inherited by Don Felipe . As the eldest surviving child , Mariana became the eighth Marchioness of Solanda and seventh Marchioness of Villarrocha . <p> Very little is known about Mariana 's childhood . She was the eldest of five sisters and spent long sojourns to the Carcelen family haciendas near Quito . The marquis supported the patriots and participated in the wars of independence , but nothing indicates that he bothered to instill republican ideas  --  or any other ideal or lofty ambition  --  in his daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their caprices went undisciplined . When Bolivar visited the Carcelens at Sucre 's prompting in 1826 , he did not see in the twenty-one-year-old marchioness the admirable woman his putative son deserved at his side . Instead of noting the exquisite fragility that Sucre had come to idealize in her , he perceived a moral frailty ; instead of remarking on her beauty and riches , Bolivar observed a lack of strength , honesty , and constancy . He gave only a reluctant blessing to the soon-to-be bride and groom , writing to Sucre after his visit , " I give my approval for the wedding without illusions . " <p> Antonio Jose de Sucre 's civilian and military career began in Venezuela when he was fifteen years old , and his rise up the ranks as well as his personal triumphs are well known . But Sucre , being a very private man , disclosed very little about his love life either in Venezuela or later in Colombia . After he landed in Guayaquil in 1821 , and before he became engaged to Mariana , two women left a profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his biography . They were Pepita Gainza and Tomasa Bravo . He met the former during a welcoming ball held in his honor . As they danced , one of the many medals that Sucre sported on his chest became entangled in Pepita 's decollete . While she tried to release herself , Sucre whispered in her ear : " Senorita , this means that my glories belong to you . " The two fell in love , but the war demanded that Sucre leave abruptly after only a few weeks . During later visits to Guayaquil , he began a rather public affair with Tomasa , a less privileged woman . When she became pregnant , Sucre assumed his obligations to her with utmost dignity . To honor Simon Bolivar , their daughter was named Simona Sucre y Bravo . When Tomasa died four years after Simona 's birth , Sucre ordered that his daughter be taken to Quito to be reared . From Peru to Bolivia , Sucre saw that his Simoncita never lacked anything . <p> Sucre first met Mariana in Latacunga , a town fifty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a great ball organized by the local cabildo to honor the man soon to become Quito 's Liberator . He had an elegant bearing , a kind and thoughtful expression in his eyes , and at twenty-seven was a mature man ; at seventeen she was still very playful , and forcefully attractive . <p> The two met again , three weeks later , after Sucre 's triumph in Pichincha under comic circumstances . Sucre would ride with the Irish colonel Daniel O'Leary along the stone-paved streets of his beloved Quito , admiring the architecture and observing the people . One day , as they were passing by the walls of the San Francisco convent , Sucre saw a few young and noisy friars peaking out a high window . Knowing that the ladies of Quito , afraid of being attacked by soldiers , had taken refuge in the city 's convents , he immediately suspected what the friars ' austere habits might be concealing , and asked permission to visit the convent . Once inside , he and O'Leary requested that they be taken to the cell on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window and the guard , under questioning by the Irishman , could not but share the truth with the visitors . A " friar " with thick eyebrows and enigmatic eyes caught Sucre 's attention . He asked her name and upon hearing it recognized Mariana Carcelen , his dancing partner of a few weeks before in Latacunga . The general advised Mariana to return home . Persuaded that she was no longer in danger , the girl mounted Sucre 's horse and returned to her home three blocks away . Don Felipe Carcelen thanked Sucre for his gesture . This was the second favor he owed the general . A few days before , Sucre had rescued him from the jail where he had been languishing for three months as punishment for having belonged to the patriots ' intelligence unit . The marquis soon would reward Sucre for his services . <p> At the beginning of June , Don Felipe asked Sucre to visit his home . When the general arrived at the manorial house , he was shown to a room where Mariana sat alone next to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single girl not be visited by a gentleman unless a chaperon were present , and Sucre thought about leaving immediately . A few minutes later , however , he was still there when the marquis entered . Without ceremony Don Felipe insisted that Sucre ask for his daughter 's hand because he had compromised her . Maybe to encourage the perplexed general , the old marquis added that at his death his eldest daughter would inherit his estates and titles . If Sucre married her , the marquis could then die in peace , knowing that his family would have Sucre 's protection and that his wealth was in good hands . Such a proposal must have offended Sucre , the scion of a distinguished and wealthy family , but he did not dare reject it . His response was the most sincere and least compromising possible under the circumstances : " I am a soldier and so I must continue fighting this war and do n't know where destiny will take me . Nevertheless , if death does n't interfere , I 'll do what is in my power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between battles and administrative duties , Sucre began a reticent courtship , and little by little fell in love with Mariana . In November they became engaged , and months later Sucre left Quito to pursue his most important military campaign : the liberation of Peru . He would not see Mariana for more than five years . During that time , Don Felipe died and Mariana inherited titles and estates . The young marchioness also fell in love with others , and resisted the idea of surrendering to the man her father had chosen . Obstinate silence was her only reply to Sucre 's many letters and messages through third parties . <p> The general , meanwhile , had several love affairs , doubted his love for Mariana  --  and was never sure that he had gained the quite  --  a 's devotion . But he continued to tend the Carcelen haciendas from afar . Also , he bought from them the Casa Azul and ordered that it be readied for the couple to live in . The letters he sent to Colonel Vicente Aguirre , his representative in Quito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his future mother-in-law 's schemes , the fate of the rest of the family , and his own emotions . " I do not want to rule her conscience , " he wrote . " Tell her a thousand times and many more that I want her to act freely . " Angry at the news that Dona Teresa wanted " to investigate " his conscience , Sucre wrote to his representative in Quito that he would prefer to break his engagement before submitting to such a humiliation . " Thus , I repeat , that if M ... has had any part whatsoever in this story you told me , you should bid her my farewell . I confess that I love her very much and that in two years my esteem for her has not waned , but my heart would never force me to acquiesce to caprices . " <p> Sucre could not return immediately to Quito . He went south , and his heart drifted away from Mariana . What was left after the field marshal 's years in Bolivia were his military feats , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria Sucre Cortes , Sucre 's first son , was born in January 1826 . His mother , Rosalia Cortes y Silva , was twenty-one and one of the most beautiful and aristocratic women in La Paz . Sucre visited his son on several occasions , but never recognized him . His second son , Cesar Sucre Rojas , was born to Dona Manuela Rojas ( also the lover of Antonio Pedro Olaneta , the head of the royalist conspiracy that almost ended Sucre 's life in 1828 ) . According to nineteenth-century writer Nicanor Mallo , Manuela was " one of those wealthy and beautiful females able to confuse the brain of the most ponderous man and unsettle the steadiest of hearts . " <p> Both affairs chilled Sucre 's feelings toward Mariana . During this period , discouraged by Bolivar 's poor opinion of his fiancee , Sucre was tempted to break his engagement . But not knowing how to untangle himself from the commitment the late marquis had forced upon him , in the end he felt compelled to keep his promise . In January 1828 he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wedding . On April 20 , 1828 , the Bishop of Cuenca joined the general and Mariana on parchment . <p> The reasons why Sucre decided to get married at that point in his life can be found in his letters to his friends : " I am old , sick and too weary to be a groom anywhere else , " he wrote to General Tomas Heres . And to another officer he explained that Mariana " is the woman who would best suit me , because her character and mine agree ... and because she is , after all , a quitena and I want to share my life with a quitena . " But Sucre 's decision ended up being not only a practical move but a providential one as well , because it added urgency to his desire to retire and live out his life in Quito or in the countryside . In the month of his marriage , a mutiny nearly cut short the life of the groom  --  " You almost married a dead man , " Sucre wrote to Mariana right after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his doubts and fears vanished ; Sucre thought only about leaving public life and returning to Quito and Mariana . <p> On September 30 , 1828 , the general arrived in Quito with an aching body and a distressed soul . He lived in veritable agony for several months . His right arm , wounded in the mutiny , required constant care ( on Saturdays a bull would be beheaded and Sucre would place his arm inside the bull 's body , believing that the animal 's blood would heal him ) ; pains in his chest filled him with alarm , and attacks of dysentery debilitated him . Also , there were dark and constant rumors of new betrayals and attacks against Bolivar . To make things worse , Peru , ignoring its debt to Sucre and Bolivar , invaded Guayaquil , and the general , maimed and tired of wars , had to put his sword once again to the service of Bolivar . <p> The newlyweds spent most of their time at the Casa Azul , and also stayed at the family hacienda in Chisinche with Dona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family tried to cheer him , new duties and burdens encumbered and worried Sucre . At the end of 1828 Sucre told Bolivar that " to the family problems , mishaps regarding our wealth have been added . " His in-laws , Sucre discovered , had very little cash and could not afford to pay huge taxes : Mariana was on the verge of losing her estates . The situation grew worse when Teresita Sucre was born in July 1829 . " Marianita gave birth on the 10th , but unfortunately it was a girl , " he wrote , feeling deeply mortified for not having given the motherland a soldier . He was so ashamed , in fact , that when he took the child to church to be baptized , Sucre ordered the doors of the Capilla del Sagrario closed and did not even invite the Carcelens . Mariana was very sick after giving birth . " Many accidents have tormented her , " Sucre wrote to Bolivar at the end of August . " The night before last they cut one of her breasts in three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free from them yet , and the surgeon might have to operate on her again . I assure you that I 'd rather have him carve my arm again than witness the pains she had to suffer . " <p> Life had become martyrdom for Sucre . After having met with Bolivar earlier , in April , Sucre , perhaps anxious to flee the problems of domestic life , accepted returning to politics and becoming the Liberator 's heir . Eight months later , he wrote his last will and testament , leaving to Teresita Sucre all his possessions ( except for his magnificent , diamond-studded sword , which he bequeathed to Bolivar ) , and left for Bogota to oblige his mentor . During the last six months of his life , Sucre 's thoughts constantly returned to his family , and he wrote beautiful letters to them ; as soon as his good judgment advised him to do so , he started his journey back to Quito . <p> Isidoro Barriga had fought in Junin and Ayacucho under Sucre and followed the field marshal to Bolivia . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not strange that when Barriga arrived in Quito in September 1829 , he began to frequent the Casa Azul . What seemed odd to many was that after Sucre 's departure the following November the officer continued to visit Mariana . Amazed neighbors were soon observing the two attending the theater and other public events together . <p> On June 4 , 1830 , as he was riding back to Quito , Sucre was assassinated in the mountains of Berruecos . And , thirteen months later , his widow married Barriga . At that time , custom dictated that a widow either devote the remainder of her life to the memory of her husband or , at the very least , wait five years before remarrying . Mariana remarried despite a " torn heart " and " painful feelings that burden my soul , " as she wrote to General Jose Maria Obando . <p> After she was unfaithful to Sucre 's memory , all semblance of deference toward her person vanished . Many accused her of being Barriga 's mistress while her husband was still alive , or doubted whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as to speculate that Mariana , because she was pregnant by Barriga , had ordered the marshal 's murder to avoid his discovery of the truth upon his return to Quito . Although these rumors proved to be false , Mariana was at the very least guilty of imprudent , foolish behavior : She had let a long time elapse before she sent a search party to where Sucre fell ; she disregarded his legacy by storing all his possessions in damp basements , where they deteriorated and were lost ; and she introduced into her home a vain and irresponsible man who ended up killing Sucre 's daughter . In mid-November of 1831 , a drunken Barriga stood on the first-floor balcony , and in an awkward attempt at playing with Teresita Sucre , threw her up in the air and failed to catch her . The little girl fell to the pavement and died . <p> After Barriga 's death , Mariana began to regret a life of frivolities and betrayals . The son she bore Barriga in 1832 , Manuel Felipe Barriga , only continued his parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to squander what remained of his mother and Sucre 's wealth . After he died in 1881 , the Casa Azul , the only home the marshal had known as an adult , had to be sold . The ill-fated hero 's mansion became a tailor 's shop , a general store , a hotel called " Le Gran Marechal , " and , finally , a museum . <p> <p> PHOTO : Dona Mariana Carcelen y Larrea <p> PHOTO : Field Marshal Antonio Jose de Sucre , right , hesitated to fulfil his promise to Mariana Carcelen <p> PHOTOS : A letter from , and a portrait of , Mariana 's mother , Teresa Larrea y Jijon , Marchioness of Solanda , who was instrumental in bringing the marriage about <p> PHOTOS : The balcony of the Casa Azul , above , the only home Sucre knew as an adult ; Mariana 's bedroom , right <p> PHOTOS : In her last years , Marian , top , dedicated her life to charity ; Mariana 's saddle , above , donated to the Museo Casa de Sucre ; after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his widow was falsely accused of involvement int he conspiracy ; Mariana 's shawl , far right , in the Museo Casa de Sucre <p> Text by Martha Gil-Montero Photographs by Judy Bustamante <p> <p> Martha Gil-Montero is a frequent contributor to Americas .
