When 16 years of civil war finally ended in 1990 , Lebanon began to resurrect itself with astonishing success . Tourists returned for the cuisine and Roman ruins . Foreign firms vied for contracts to rebuild highways , power plants and the Beirut commercial district . Last January electricity became available 24 hours a day , for the first time in two decades . Then two weeks ago , the lights went out as Israeli F-16 fighters rocketed power plants east of the capital as part of a major bombardment of the Lebanese countryside . The damage done by the Israeli onslaught was especially bitter for a country so far along the way to recovery . " It felt like we were going back to square one , " said Walid Jumblatt , a member of the Lebanese Cabinet . <P> Lebanon is not as devastated as before , but the damage has been substantial . So has the shock . While the conflict in the south sputtered on year after year , Beirutis had become complacent about it . But in its effort to put pressure on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go after Hizballah guerrillas ; it attacked the infrastructure and drove people from their homes by shelling and bombing villages , after warning the residents that they would be killed if they did not leave . At least 160 Lebanese were killed during the operation , and half a million people were displaced . <P> The people of southern Lebanon have survived repeated Israeli assaults  --  in 1978 , 1982 , 1993 and last month . Saadallah Balhas , 56 , is an agricultural worker who was badly wounded in Qana , where Israeli artillery shelled a U.N . post sheltering more than 600 civilians . Last week he recognized this reporter visiting the hospital in Tyre where he was being treated . We had spoken in July 1993 after the Israelis bombed his house during an earlier offensive , breaking both his legs . " In 1993 you took my picture , " he said . " My wife Zeinab was standing beside me . She died in Qana . " His children and grandchildren also died there . " I saw my children scattered like dead sheep around me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs , the Lebanese government believes Israel inflicted more than $200 million worth of damage . The Qana bloodshed most angered and saddened the Lebanese , but the attacks on the power stations convinced them that Israel wanted to sabotage Lebanon 's recovery . " Electricity is symbolic . It was the government 's first success story , " said Mohib Itani , director of the country 's electricity company . Lebanon had spent more than $1 billion as it doubled electrical capacity in the years since the civil war ended . After watching the Israeli air raid on Bsalim power station from his office window , Itani shed tears of rage . <P> While the blitz continued , Lebanon lived out a strange dichotomy . Reconstruction continued in the midst of destruction . Israeli missile ships shelled the coastal highway between Beirut and Tyre . Yet at the end of the hair-raising high-speed dash through explosions , motorists came upon giant Caterpillars smoothing the new airport runway .
