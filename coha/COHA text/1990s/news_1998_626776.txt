<p> Countless comedians have uttered these words at the outset of a cruise : <p> " You 've come aboard as passengers , but with all the food here , you 'll be leaving as cargo . " <p> Better weigh those thoughts . Oh , it 's still possible to gorge yourself silly on around-the-clock dining alternatives .
