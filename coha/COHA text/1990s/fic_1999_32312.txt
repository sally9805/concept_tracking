Word Power Vicki Byrne awoke with a start at 4 A.M. She could not push from her mind her friend Shelly . Vicki had prayed for Shelly often , but this morning was different . The more she thought of her , the more concerned she became . Was Shelly in some sort of danger ? Vicki wanted to talk to Shelly about God , but each time it was as if the door had closed . Either Shelly was busy or Shelly 's friend had barged in and stopped the conversation . Vicki could tell Shelly was still in shock after the disappearances . Shelly needed the truth . Each time Vicki had called her , she either got the answering machine or someone who said Shelly could n't talk right now . It would have been easy to give up and talk to people who wanted to hear her message , but Vicki could n't get Shelly out of her mind . Shelly looked so lost and confused . She dialed Shelly 's number but hung up before it rang . This is crazy ! Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hour for nothing . speak to Shelly about you today . " * * * At breakfast Judd told Lionel and Ryan , " Remember to be waiting for us after school today . I do n't want to be late for our study with Bruce . " " Yes sir ! " Ryan said , saluting . " By the flagpole . " " Too many war movies , " Lionel muttered , shaking his head . " I 'm not kidding , " Judd said . " Do n't be off playing soccer or basketball " " We 'll be there , " Lionel said , scowling at Ryan . " My newspaper could be what God uses to get to students . Maybe they 'll take it home to their parents . " Vicki squinted . Judd was talking as if it were his idea . She felt silly for caring . Could n't she just be happy it was being done and that people would be reached ? But Judd should n't care either . " We get to help , right ? " Ryan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The school paper comes out on Tuesday . I want to beat them and get ours out Monday . Vicki and I will write the articles and get it on the computer , but we need you guys to help print and fold and " " Grunt work , " Lionel said . " There 's no little job , " Judd said . " We 're starting with 500 copies . That 'll take everybody 's help . " " How are you gon na give it out ? " Ryan said . Judd shrugged . " I figure I 'll take one entrance and Vicki can take another . We 'll hand it out as the kids go in . " Ryan poked at his cereal and shook his head . " What if the principal and that coach , what 's his name ? " " Handlesman , " Vicki said . " Yeah . What if they stop you before you get started ? " " He 's right , " Vicki said . " No Bibles , no talking about God , you know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least of my worries right now , " Judd said . " We need to write the Underground first . " " Is that what you 're calling it ? " Vicki said . " Got a better idea ? " * * * On the way to school Judd reminded Lionel and Ryan again to be ready after school . When they were gone , Vicki said , " You might want to go easy on them . I mean , you can come across wrong if you 're not careful . " Judd cocked his head . " I want them to understand how important this is . You know how busy Bruce is , and we only have the weekend to get the paper done if we want to distribute it Monday . " Vicki did n't like having PE first thing every day . Mrs. Waltonen sometimes lost track of time , and they were barely able to dress before second period . " Byrne ! " Mrs. Waltonen shouted as the class ended . Vicki ran over as the other girls left the gym . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waltonen had seemed shattered the week before while talking about losing her grandchild in the disappearances . " The other day , " Mrs. Waltonen said , " you said something about knowing where people were . The ones who disappeared . " Vicki nodded . " You know I ca n't allow those conversations . About religious things . " " I do n't want to offend anybody , " Vicki said . " I wo n't disrupt class anymore , if that 's what you mean . " " You do n't understand , " Mrs. Waltonen said , lowering her voice . " After class , on a personal basis , you know , one-on-one , I do n't think they said anything about that . " " You want to talk about where your grandson is ? " " Granddaughter , " Mrs. Waltonen said . " Not even six months old . " Vicki stared at the teacher . Mrs. Waltonen was older than Vicki 's mother , and yet she was looking to Vicki for some kind of hope . " Everybody 's lost someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left us without answers . But you'rewell , better because of it . Something 's different for you , Vicki . " Mrs. Waltonen suddenly seemed so soft . With her shrill whistle and the way she barked orders , she was the last person Vicki would have expected to start such a conversation . " I have changed , " Vicki said . " And the reason I believe I know about your " The bell rang . Girls ran from the dressing room . " You have to go , " Mrs. Waltonen said , touching Vicki 's arm . " It 's OK . I want to stay and talk " " Maybe later . Maybe Monday . " Vicki did n't want to let the moment go , but Mrs. Waltonen urged her to dress and get to class . Vicki wondered if she would actually have the chance to lead one of her teachers to the truth . Vicki was late for second period . She wiped her forehead and said , " I had gym . " The teacher let it pass . After each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever that something was wrong . * * * " A kid in homeroom got her Bible taken , " Lionel said in the car after school . " They called it dangerous material . ' " " All we hear is stuff about self-esteem and peace , " Ryan said . " Makes me sick . " Judd thought Bruce Barnes would be overjoyed at Vicki 's news about talking with her PE teacher . But they found him weeping , his head on his desk . A young woman rose to meet them and closed Bruce 's door . " I 'm Chloe Steele , " she said . " You must be the Young Trib Force . " Judd , Vicki , and Lionel introduced themselves , but when Chloe saw Ryan , she hugged him tight . " I know you , do n't I ? You used to play with Raymie . " Ryan looked embarrassed and did n't seem to know what to do . " Raymie 's her little brother , " he explained . " I 'm sorry , " Chloe said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barnes is not having a good day . " " What 's wrong ? " Judd said . Before she could answer , the door opened and Bruce waved them inside . Judd saw tearstained pages on Bruce 's desk and recognized the church directory . He picked it up and saw Bruce , a bit younger and fuller in the face with a pasted-on smile . Surrounding him were his wife and children . What a treasure Bruce had lost ! On the next page was Dr. Vernon Billings , the now departed senior pastor . Judd quickly turned to the back of the directory and found his own family . His mother and father stood behind the smiling twins , Marc and Marcie . Judd was off to the side , a few inches from the rest , straight and rigid . No smile . He looked like he wanted to be anywhere but in that picture . Judd flipped through a few other listings and saw friends and familiar faces now gone . " Let me see , " Vicki said . Ryan pointed out Raymie 's picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce explained that the reporter , Cameron Williams , had discovered the directory and was impressed by the pictures of the Steele family . Chloe blushed . " It brought it all back to me , " Bruce said . " All the pain that night my wife and kids were taken . " Bruce composed himself and asked if anyone minded if Chloe joined them . No one objected . " There 's been a development with the two witnesses in Jerusalem , " Bruce said . Judd noticed the others sit straighter when they heard Bruce 's solemn tone . " This is going to be on the news tonight , and you may not want to watch . A half dozen thugs tried to charge the witnesses . I do n't know what they thought they could do , but they were killed . On the spot . " " What happened ? " Judd said . " They were burned to death . " Vicki gasped . " Cool , " Ryan said . " There 's nothing cool about it , " Bruce said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks his heart too . What you saw was a direct fulfillment of God 's prophecy in Revelation 11 . Grab a Bible and let 's read what the angel tells the apostle John . " Bruce asked Vicki to read the passage . " " And I will give power to my two witnesses , and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days , clothed in sackcloth . " These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the God of the earth . And if anyone wants to harm them , fire proceeds from their mouth and devours their enemies . And if anyone wants to harm them , he must be killed in this manner . ' " For the next half hour Bruce explained this and other prophecies being fulfilled before their eyes . Vicki told of Mrs. Waltonen again and also how worried she was about Shelly . " Why would n't God let me see her today ? " she said . " I do n't know , " Bruce said . " But keep praying for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huddled to pray and ask God for opportunities to speak of their faith . Bruce prayed that people would have their eyes opened to the truth . * * * Over hamburgers in front of the TV , Ryan said , " We forgot something . " " Do n't talk with your mouth full , " Lionel said . " I can see pickles . What 'd we forget ? " " We did n't ask Bruce about the Underground . " Judd smashed his trash and tossed up a shot that bounced around the can and dropped in . " Ask him ? " he said . " Since when do we need Bruce 's permission ? " " Judd ! " Vicki said . " I just think it would be better to surprise him , " he said . " Let 's get the first issue done and see what happens . " He did n't return Vicki 's gaze . " I 'm tired , " she said . " I 'll write my story in the morning . " Judd sat at the computer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up it was 3 A.M. He still was n't satisfied with the graphics for the Underground logo . Creating a newspaper was going to be a lot more difficult than he imagined . He spotted a copy of the same church directory he had seen in Bruce 's office . He leafed through until he came to his family . Judd had clenched his teeth hard at Bruce 's office . He had to be strong . He had to be the leader . What he would n't give to have his mom and dad back ! He wanted to ask questions . Life questions . Questions about the Bible . He missed his brother and sister . He just wanted to be with them and laugh again . One picture haunted him . The youth group . All those kids sitting around a table , smiling and eating popcorn . Every one of them was now gone . All but one . All but him .
