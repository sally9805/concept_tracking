Section : A View from the East <p> A new European order is evolving , as the East breaks free from the shackles of Yalta , and the West moves toward integration . A Polish leader asks how the two halves of that new order can be combined , and what America 's role might be . <p> More and more people are starting to believe that the Yalta era in Europe has come to an end . There are those who believe it ended when the Mazowiecki government took over in Poland ; for some , the end was marked by the election of Vaclav Havel in Czechoslovakia ; for still others it came with the free elections in East Germany . However , even though the political situation in Eastern and Central Europe has radically changed , the legacy of the Yalta order lives on . It will take many years and much effort finally to erase it , since its continuing presence is a result not just of the current political arrangements but also of almost half a century of a divided Europe . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born in Poland , we were conscious that the fight for freedom , justice , democracy , and the rule of law would be not so much against the Polish Communists and their state apparatus  --  we could have dealt with them easily enough  --  as against the entire Yalta system which had surrendered Poland to the rule of Communist Russia . What this meant in practice we had learned from the Hungarian and Czech experiences of 1956 and 1968 respectively . These two events showed that Russia would not hesitate to launch a military intervention if she felt her imperial interests were threatened . These events also showed that the West 's reaction to Russian violations of human rights and the principles of international conduct would be confined to the passing of diplomatic notes and the imposition of temporary economic sanctions . <p> Realism dictated that we move cautiously , step by step , testing the limits of Russian tolerance . At the same . time our hopes grew as we watched the Helsinki Accords destroy Yalta 's main political foundation : the separation of East and West . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so-called " third basket " gave the West a moral and political right to take an interest in what was going on in the East . This forced Moscow to make some effort to keep up the appearance of respecting human rights , which in turn stimulated political activity . <p> But there is no doubt in my mind that the factors which made the dissolution of the Yalta order irreversible were the evident economic failure of collectivism and the deep attachment of the captive peoples-strengthened by ideals emanating from the West  --  to freedom , justice , and democracy . <p> When , in the last days of the 1970s , after the dramatic strikes in Gdansk , Szczecin , and Elblag , Edward Gierek came to power , his administration decided to move Poland into the market system of the Free World  --  preserving , however , the prerogatives of socialism . The next ten years were a time of learning through painful experience that left the country burdened with a huge foreign debt and one of the most dramatic disappointments in our history . It became apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the bounds of socialism an effective economy that could benefit from international cooperation . Time on Their Side <p> The collapse of the Communist economic system , growing more acute with every passing year , forced Moscow to seek closer cooperation with the West , while the far-sighted policy of Ronald Reagan 's America tied the issue of East-West relations to that of human rights . We strongly felt , even when martial law was imposed in December of 1981 , that time was on our side . Year by year , the decay of Communism was becoming more manifest . It seemed that the convergence compelled by economic necessity would inevitably bring down the political barriers , allowing Poland  --  and other Eastern European countries  --  to reunite with Western Europe . <p> However , the plans then being proposed for further integration of Western Europe ran counter to these changes taking place in the East . The wall that Yalta had built not only divided the continent into two political and military blocs , but also shattered the natural unity of Europe stemming from common Christian roots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division . I have no doubt that all that the proponents of the 1992 project intended was to strengthen the Free World . But from our point of view , 1992 entailed the risk of making the barrier between East and West a permanent feature . Cut Off at the Elbe <p> From the very beginning we realized that by not being a party to the process of integration , we Poles , and also the Czechs , Hungarians , Bulgarians , and Rumanians , could , in the natural course of events , drift even further away from those centers of European civilization with which we had centuries-long associations . Looking toward 1992 from the perspective of the Eastern European realities of the 1980s , Poland would become as remote from the West as Zimbabwe . We would see , on the other side of the Elbe , the creation of a strongly integrated world of affluence , modernity , and advanced technology , free of trade barriers and interested in cooperation with its own equals Japan and America . The effect on the East would naturally have been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of socialism  --  the very structures we wanted to break free of . <p> In the future , it may be very interesting to examine the extent to which the specter of 1992 shaped the attitudes and policy formulations of Eastern European leaders . By a lucky chance the West 's announcement of its integration plans came during a period of profound changes in the East . Thanks to the crisis  --  not only of the economy but of internal politics as well  --  for the first time the integration of the West could not be countered by one in the East . <p> Quite unexpected new issues confronted both the East and the West when in 1989 the whole Yalta order began to waver . The recovery of national identity by the Eastern European nations , one after another , confronted the whole continent with the question of the future form of European identity . <p> But in the second half of 1989 and the early months of 1990 , Europeans had to learn yet another difficult lesson in political realism . It became evident that after half a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very difficult , protracted , and costly task , because the division had become not so much political as civilizational in character . The border along the Elbe divides two worlds at different stages of development , with different economic systems ( not only and not even foremost in the sense of different ownership systems ) , different social structures , different living styles . Technological standards are different , as are auditing and banking systems , not to mention the organization of labor , communications infrastructure , or living standards . <p> The fact that it is not political differences but civilizational ones that separate the East from the West means that pan-European unity will be effected not as the immediate result of political decisions but as the outcome of a lengthy process . On the other hand , common sense tells us that sustaining the present divisions until the civilizational barriers have disappeared may mean perpetuating them ad infinitum . The process of integrating the whole of Europe should not be deferred . <p> The East-West dichotomy , which mirrored the underlying rivalry between two systems and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituting an all-European security system . The building of a new Europe , especially in view of the impending German reunification and the diminishing superpower presence , seems to be a matter of some urgency , not one that can wait for the civilizational gap to disappear . Moreover , since the road to economic integration can not be traveled too fast , we should use this time to set up institutions to foster political rapprochement . Questions First <p> In the political sphere , the West and the budding democracies of the East have enough interests and needs in common to guarantee the success of such ventures . But before integration actually begins-and it should commence simultaneously with the process of German reunification  --  several fundamental questions will have to be answered . <p> First : what institutional expression should this process have ? I believe that there are two major roads toward European confederation . One is the expansion of the European Parliament , a process which has de facto already begun with the granting of observer status to the newly freed nations . The second is the institutionalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framework , of parliamentary representation , the expansion of the role of the Council of Europe , and the establishment of a Council of European Cooperation . <p> Secondly : who should participate in this process ? I believe that entry into the European process should be determined by only two criteria : being in Europe , and having a democratic political system . Today , this would mean the exclusion of Albania , which never took part in the Helsinki process . The participation of the United States , Canada , and the Soviet Union remains an open question . What form the participation of the American countries should take would have to be considered , but I do not think that the cause of European security would be well served by the withdrawal of an American presence from Europe . As concerns the Soviet Union , its participation would be greatly desirable , but only if the Soviet society is able to build a truly democratic state . <p> Thirdly : what should be the end result of this process ? The first objective , of course , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be achieved by exercising political will  --  namely , in the fields of security , culture , the flow of information , people , and ideas . There can be very little doubt that with some good will it might be possible , in a relatively short time , to abolish visa requirements , introduce regulations enhancing international security , pass legislation protecting the rights of ethnic minorities , and work out a common environmental-protection strategy . Lastly , we could attempt to build the rudiments of the future pan-European parliament , which could serve as a testing ground for the functioning of that unparalleled political formation that the united Europe is to become . A Europe of Homelands <p> This might be the fastest way of building a Europe of Homelands , which would constitute a realistic and optimal compromise between a continental leviathan-state  --  doomed , I believe , to share the fate of the ethnic timebomb that was nineteenth-century Austria-Hungary  --  and a Europe of warring nationalisms , as existed on the eve of World War II . A Europe of Homelands respecting the cultural and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rights of minorities , might be a formula that both East and West could accept . <p> One of the advantages of following this route is that we can set forth without waiting for that distant moment when the economic situation has been made sufficiently uniform in all parts of Europe to allow for the abolition of frontiers and the free flow of capital , goods , and labor . The economic unity of Europe should be built cautiously and gradually , so as not to upset the balance in the labor market in the rich countries , for instance , and so as to avoid an actual colonization of the poorer southern and eastern regions by the affluent nations . Everything that upsets the natural equilibrium , every situation that induces a sense of insecurity , could rapidly undermine the whole process , precipitating a revival of nationalism and national tensions . <p> While the building of a political structure for a Europe of Homelands must , of course , be a continental process in scope , the subsequent economic integration should initially be limited to the regional level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such initiatives , but under no circumstances should it force or impose them . <p> Local transnational communities will undoubtedly emerge spontaneously , providing that the logic of the whole process is conducive to it . Already , we can talk about the formation of at least two of them . <p> The first , organized along the Danube axis , would encompass Hungary , Czechoslovakia , Austria , and Italy  --  countries that represent three already-existing economic organizations : the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and the European Free Trade Association ( EFTA ) in the West , and Comecon in the East . The boldness of a conception which takes into account natural economic ties rather than the countries ' current formal political status illustrates the range of possibilities created when the new European process was set in motion by the force of circumstances . <p> The idea for the second of these communities is based on a even bolder conjecture , one which presupposes that the European process will bring freedom not only to the so-called satellite countries , but also to those which have been forcibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a unique and very promising network between Scandinavia and the Baltic states  --  Lithuania , Latvia , and Estonia . <p> The geographical space between the two communities is occupied by Poland , which stretches from the Baltic Sea in the north down to the Carpathian mountains in the south . With its population of forty million people and its large territory , Poland constitutes a natural bridge between northern and southern Europe , and in that sense can become a logical link between the two emerging constellations . <p> Poland could undoubtedly play a similar role in relations between the Western countries and the western " republics " of the Soviet Union , principally Ukraine and Byelorussia . It seems of secondary importance whether they will win independence or decide to remain within the state that will emerge in place of the USSR . <p> As regards Russia herself , it is difficult to make any predictions , even in the short-term perspective of 1992 . After all , it is even possible that she will turn away from Europe to seek more congenial partners in South and Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to forecast developments in the Balkan states ( especially Rumania and Yugoslavia ) , which still , it seems , have a long way to go . <p> I therefore do not think that the process of European integration can be construed in terms of a simple merging of the three currently existing categories of countries . The New Europe will not be a sum total of the EEC , EFTA , and Comecon . Its formation on the economic side will entail establishing a network of local connections that would gradually eradicate barriers , abolish frontiers , and form transnational economic structures that will ultimately merge into one integrated European economy . <p> This process has taken the West four decades , and it would be naive to think that the rest of the continent can catch up in just one . It would be just as naive to think that the East will be able to cope with the task it faces without help from an already-integrated West . <p> Only within that process , however , does 1992 cease to be the final endorsement of Yalta and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more important in that it will incorporate a united Germany into the European structure  --  a Germany that could otherwise become , in the likely absence of superpowers , the major threat to continental stability . <p> There will be no true stability in Europe , however , so long as there is a wall between East and West . It used to be the Berlin Wall . There is a danger now of a European policy that would move the wall to the Oder-Neisse line . This strategy must be rejected . Only then will we in the East , and you in the West , be able to say that , at long last , we have laid the ghost of Yalta that casts a shadow over our lives and your consciences . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Bronislaw Geremek <p> <p> Mr. Geremek is parliamentary head of Solidarity .
