Summary <p> Background During the past few decades the need for humanities in medical education has been increasingly emphasised . We sought to find out how doctors meet their cultural needs during their spare time , in comparison with other university graduates . We also aimed , in this Norwegian survey , to analyse differences between doctors according to various professional characteristics . <p> Methods 1041 Norwegian doctors ( 71% of those approached ) reported their cultural activities through a postal survey . Their replies were compared with those of 224 university graduates who had taken part in a similar survey by Statistics Norway in 1991 . <p> Findings The doctors spent less time than the other graduates on reading newspapers and watching television , though they were more musically active and 18% play at least one instrument regularly . No other differences were apparent . The more time doctors spent on medical reading , the more time they also devoted to non-medical reading . No systematic differences in cultural activity according to medical specialty were found , but women were more culturally active than men . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not limit doctors ' cultural life . Spare-time cultural activities among doctors seem to be determined more by personal than by professional characteristics . <p> Lancet 1996 ; 348 : 1692-94 Introduction <p> The Greek god of medicine , Asclepios , was the son of Apollo , the god of art , music , and literature . Modern medicine pays little attention to this traditional association between medicine and the humanities . Success is based on the continuously increasing explanatory power of natural science and technology . <p> During the past few decades , however , the need for humanities in medical education , both undergraduate and postgraduate , has been repeatedly emphasised. 1 , 2 According to the proponents of this idea , to help patients effectively , a doctor must be able not only to explain observations but also to understand the patient 's primary world of meanings . <p> Literature and medicine has , since 1972 , been part of the curriculum in some medical schools in the USA , and a 1994 survey suggested that a third of medical schools in the USA taught literature to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been described and advocated in several articles in The Lancet. 4-6 In most medical schools and postgraduate training programmes , however , humanities are still viewed as superfluous activities , and doctors must meet their cultural needs in their spare time . On average doctors work longer hours and have less spare time than the rest of the population . In Norway , for example , doctors ' working hours exceed those of the average employee by 40% and those of the average university graduate by 25%. 7 Rothman 8 reported that doctors have few hobbies and a narrow range of interest , and that they spend little time on cultural activities . A widespread belief is that the more doctors become engaged in medical life , the less time they devote to cultural activities . Our own experience suggests , however , that many doctors can manage both a professional career and other activities . <p> We aimed to compare the cultural activities of doctors with those of other university graduates ( in Norway ) and to analyse differences in cultural activities according to professional characteristics and activity . Methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the health and welfare of doctors in Norway . It was based on a cross-sectional postal survey of members of the Norwegian Medical Association ( more than 94% of all Norwegian doctors ) . The survey was based on 15 extensive questionnaires , and to ensure an adequate response rate without exhausting the respondents , an overlapping questionnaire design was developed. 9 Each doctor received one basic questionnaire and a random sample of three supplementary questionnaires . The basic questionnaire sought information on health , wellbeing , professional career , work satisfaction , and demographic data . Randomised subsamples of respondents for one questionnaire ( eg , on cultural activities ) replied also to others ( eg , on working hours and work-related autonomy ) . <p> Of the 11367 active members of the Norwegian Medical Association ( excluding students and retired doctors ) , 101 took part in pilot trials , and a random sample of 2000 were excluded so that they could participate in prospective studies as part of the research programme . Thus , 9266 physicians were available for the cross-sectional study . 1476 doctors received the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing medical education and religion . The questionnaires were mailed in March , 1993 , and one reminder letter was sent . <p> The questions on cultural activities were taken from a survey by Statistics Norway in 1991 10 of the general Norwegian population . University graduates from the general population with at least 15 years ' education were the reference group for our study ( n=224 ) . <p> The doctors were asked to indicate how much time they spent watching television and reading on the day before they completed the questionnaire and to specify the sort of material they read . They were asked how many times they had attended the theatre , the opera , the cinema , and concerts during the previous 12 months . We asked whether they played a musical instrument or were active in an orchestra or a choir . Their assessment of the time spent on these activities was requested . We did not ask about participation in sports and other outdoor activities . <p> We constructed an index for cultural activity : reading non-medical material for 20 min or longer the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orchestra or choir scored one point each ; number of visits to the cinema , the theatre , the opera , classical music concerts , and popular musical concerts scored one point for one to four visits and two points for five or more visits . The maximum score was therefore 13 . <p> For the assessment of doctors ' cultural activity by specialty , we classified them according to their board certification . Questionnaire findings <p> 1041 ( 71% ) of the 1476 doctors approached completed the cultural questionnaire  --  306 women and 734 men ( one respondent did not specify sex ) . The average agewas 39.1 years for the women and 43.8 years for the men . 153 ( 15% ) respondents were family physicians , 145 ( 14% ) surgical specialists ( including anaesthetists , gynaecologists , and otorhinolaryngologists ) , 143 ( 14% ) medical specialists , 73 ( 7% ) psychiatrists , 52 ( 5% ) specialists in community medicine , and 46 ( 4% ) laboratory specialists . 429 ( 41% ) held no certified specialty ; many of these were in specialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctors spent less time on reading newspapers and more time on reading magazines ; the two groups did not differ in the mean time spent reading books ( table 1 ) . A greater proportion of doctors than of other university graduates had spent some time reading a book during the previous24 h , but among the participants who had done so , the mean time spent was shorter for doctors than for the other graduates ( 41 vs 55 min ) . Older doctors reported spending more time on reading newspapers and books and less on reading magazines than their younger colleagues . Women doctors spent less time reading newspapers and more time reading books than male doctors , and there were also differences between the sexes in the types of books they read ( table 2 ) . The participating doctors reported that they spent an average of 264 min ( 95% CI 249-278 ) on reading medical literature , of which 171 min ( 160-181 ) went on articles and medical journals . There was an association between medical and non-medical reading  --  the more time reportedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week ) , the more also spent on non-medical reading ( figure ) . <p> According to their questionnaire reports , women doctors had attended the cinema and the theatre more often during the previous year than had men ( 4.8 vs 3.5 for cinema , 2.6 vs 2.1 for theatre ) . More of the group of doctors as a whole than of university graduates had attended classical music concerts ( 64 vs 50% had attended at least one concert during the previous year ) , but the proportions who had attended other cultural events did not differ between the groups ( table 1 ) . When we looked at the effect of age on cultural activities , we found that older doctors were more likely to go to the theatre , the opera , and classical music concerts , whereas younger doctors tended to prefer films and popular music . <p> University graduates in the general population in Norway reported spending 87 min per day on watching television. 10 Our medical participants said they spent less time than this watching television  --  women reported an average of 57 min @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 56% of the doctors could play at least one instrument , and 18% played regularly , compared with 47% and 12% , respectively , of the university graduates . More psychiatrists ( 31% ) than other specialists played an instrument regularly . 8% of the doctors and 9% of the university graduates said they were active members of a choir or orchestra . Primary-care doctors were more likely than those in other specialties ( 13 vs 7% ) to be members of a choir or orchestra . <p> The average score for cultural activity was 4.5 ( 95% CI 4.2-4.7 ) for women doctors and 4.1 ( 3.9-4.2 ) for male doctors . The cultural activity score was not related to age , specialty , job satisfaction , or stress . Total working hours were recorded for a random subsample of 261 responders ( average 46.9 45.6-48.3 hours per week ) . The cultural activity index was related to the number of working hours for women . Another subsample of 327 respondents reported on work-related autonomy ( a composite score based on six questions about latitude in decision-making about work speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the possibility to postpone things or take a day off ) . We found a positive relation between this measure and the cultural activity index . <p> The doctors said they would like to spend more time on hobbies , outdoor activities , and cultural activities , and with family and friends ( table 3 ) . Those working more than 50 h per week were more likely than those working shorter hours to express this desire . Discussion <p> The cultural activities defined in this study may seem a heterogeneous group of pursuits . Even though a horror film differs greatly from a symphony , they both contribute to people 's cultural input , and the time devoted to various activities reflects a person 's priorities . Much less initiative is needed to watch television at home ( which we did not include in our cultural index ) than to go out to a concert , film , or play . <p> We found that doctors are interested in the arts and humanities , and that they give cultural spare-time activities a high priority . The doctors differed somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they spent less time reading newspapers and watching television and more time on musical activities . The doctors spent as much time on cultural spare-time activities as other university graduates , despite their longer working hours , but a substantial proportion said that they would like to spend more time on cultural activities , which suggests that their long working hours and the demands of their work tend to interfere with these activities . Furthermore , cultural activity was positively correlated with the doctor 's perceived autonomy  --  doctors who could adapt the organisation of their work to the demands of the clinical situation and to their own needs tended to be more culturally active . Since perceived autonomy consistently counteracts the perception of stress , 11 this result lends some support to the hypothesis that a demanding job and long working hours do have a negative impact on cultural activity . <p> Our results support the hypothesis that musical accomplishment is more widespread among doctors than among other professionals. 12 Primary-care physicians were more likely than others to be members of a choir or orchestra , perhaps because they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding on the cultural activity index was the lack of association with several measures of stress and wellbeing that in other parts of our research programme have been shown to distinguish well between various groups of doctors. 14 No systematic differences between specialties were found . The only significant group differences in cultural activity were between women and men . These differences may be related to the over-representation of women doctors in specialties in which culture and interpersonal perspectives dominate , such as psychiatry and family medicine. 15 As women doctors increasingly choose the more technical specialties , perhaps , overall , specialists in these disciplines will tend to be influenced by feminine interests and values ; alternatively , these values may diminish as a result of the women 's integration into a pre-existing masculine setting . <p> As a part of the study of humanities in medicine , the cultural life of doctors and the possible impact of doctors ' cultural activities on their professional work should be further examined .
