What a difference a decade makes . Mediagenic writers like Jay McInerney and Tama Janowitz once held the limelight with modish novels about fast life in the 1980s . But those authors have now faded into their own material , symbols of the superficialities they exploited in their fiction . <P> Why ? One explanation is that literature is no more immune to changing fashions than any other form of entertainment . Novels that reflect only the glittering moment usually turn out to be artifacts , not art . Another reason is that literary fiction of the past two decades , good at dramatizing personal crises , has rarely attempted to engage the tumult of the wider world . Social disorder is handled more efficiently in nonfiction , journalism or seductively moving images . Who needs to plow through an imaginative verbal construct when the content is available in more accessible forms ? <P> Fiction writer Jonathan Franzen faced that fact last year in a long , fretful article in Harper 's magazine . " The novelist , " he wrote , " has more and more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read : where to find the energy to engage with a culture in crisis when the crisis consists in the impossibility of engaging with the culture ? " <P> But Franzen 's gloomy observation has not deflected him or three other gifted writers of his acquaintance : Donald Antrim , Rick Moody and David Foster Wallace , last year 's young literary comet . Only two months after Franzen 's complaint , Wallace made a connection with Infinite Jest , his 1,000-page opus about an early 21st century North America splintered by drugs , fanatics and a business ethic so venal that even the months of the year have product names . <P> Wallace 's wit and funky erudition encores this year in A Supposedly Fun Thing I 'll Never Do Again ( Little , Brown ; 353 pages ; $23.95 ) , a collection of essays and highly personalized journalism . Writing about subjects as unrelated as tennis , Dostoyevsky and Caribbean cruise ships , Wallace again demonstrates powers of split-screen vision and information processing that should be measured in megabytes rather than IQ points . <P> Franzen and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , Franzen 's deft social-science fiction about a former Bombay police chief who plots to take over St. Louis , Missouri , first published in 1988 , was recently released in paperback ( Noonday Press ; 517 pages ; $15 ) . <P> Franzen displays a striking talent for turning an implausible plot into a convincing omen . Middle-class flight , a shriveled tax base and the usual urban rumpuses encourage St. Louis authorities to hire S. Jammu , a woman related to Indira Gandhi , to run its police department . Soon Jammu and her imported Indian co-conspirators launch a power grab that includes Orwellian public relations , kidnappings and pet assassinations . Franzen 's twisty plot and thriller pace are the sweeteners that mask his caustic commentary on urban decline .
