The place seemed as unlikely as the coming together of the two principals . In June of this year , Princess Diana went to visit Mother Teresa in New York City 's South Bronx , where the founder of the Missionaries of Charity was recuperating from an illness at one of her order 's residences . Surrounding the world 's two most recognizable women were the dusty tenements and gutted cars of the not yet revived area . The Saint of the Gutters was in her element , which more recently had become Diana 's too . That is why the princess came to meet the nun , to pay her respects to the woman whose devotion to the poor and dying she was beginning to absorb . <P> So they met and chatted about the work they loved , for no more than an hour . Diana helped Mother Teresa rise from her wheelchair , and the two of them emerged from a private conversation holding hands , to be greeted by squealing children in a crowd . Diana , in a cream-colored linen suit , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billie Burke dwarfed the Munchkins in The Wizard of Oz . They were affectionate toward each other , put their faces close to each other . Mother Teresa clasped her palms together in the Indian namaste , signifying both hello and farewell . The princess got into her silver car . And that was that . <P> Now they are dead , within a week , and one wonders how to grasp what has been lost . In a way , their deaths are the ending to two stories . Princess Diana 's was the less significant but the more enthralling , a royal soap opera played by real people suffering real pain . When she was killed , her story was curtailed , and the silence that followed was overwhelming . One reason that masses stood in lines all over the world is that they knew a story they yearned to hear , and thought would go on , was over . <P> Mother Teresa 's story was more of process and had fewer elements with which the audience could easily identify . For most of the years of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wretched streets of Calcutta to take dying people in her arms or when she touched the open wounds of the poor , the despondent , the discarded and alone . When the Nobel Committee blasted her with fame , she had already written most of the tale of her life , which was without much plot , was propelled by a main character who never changed direction , yet had a great theme . The end of Mother Teresa 's story is not the end of her order 's work , which is one reason ( her age is another ) that her death makes one sad without shock . <P> The two women were united by an impulse toward charity , and charity is a tricky way to live . A nun I know in Brooklyn , Sister Mary Paul , who has worked with the down-and-nearly-out all her life , once told me , " People in the helping professions are curious . I think they may feel something is missing in their lives . There can be a lot of ego , a lot of vicarious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and giving person . There is nothing wrong in that , but it ca n't be the only goal . The ultimate goal must be a change in the system in which both the giver and taker live . " She does n't like the word charity except in the sense of caritas , love . " Love , " she said , " is not based on marking people up by assets and virtues . Love is based on the mystery of the person , who is unfathomable and is going somewhere I will never know . "
