ASK POPULAR SCIENCE What do those wing-like appendages on the back of cars do ? dmalmgren@aol.com THOSE WING-LIKE structures are generally known as spoilers or airfoils . Most of them are cosmetic add-ons that do nothing but enhance the racy look of a coupe or sport sedan . Properly designed , however , a spoiler can influence the air flowing over the back of the car and deliver two aerodynamic benefits : downforce ( which helps the rear tires grip the road ) and diminished wind resistance . Race cars exploit the downforce effect to improve their cornering speeds . But it 's not merely at the racetrack that spoilers can help . Less wind resistance also helps road cars deliver higher fuel economy at cruising speeds . Why is there more static electricity when it 's cold ? Brett Huson Hazelton , British Columbia STATIC ELECTRICITY is more common under dry conditions ; when it 's cold , the air is typically drier than when it 's warm . Here 's how that works . As the temperature drops , fewer molecules are in motion , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies of water - say , the ocean , a lake , or a pool-and become airborne . It 's the airborne water that causes humidity . So why does moisture inhibit the buildup of static electricity ? According to Micheal Dubson of the University of Colorado 's physics department , " Water molecules remove the charge from charged objects , but dry air molecules do not . " Since water is a polar molecule ( one side has a positive charge , the other a negative charge ) , it can pick up or " steal " an extra electron from a charged object , effectively removing its charge . Air molecules , most commonly oxygen or nitrogen , are not polar and have no attraction to charged molecules . So they do n't disperse any existing charges that cause static electricity . What causes hiccups , and why do they occur repeatedly ? David Hsu Overland Park , Kan . HICCUPS ARE caused by a sudden contraction of the diaphragm , the involuntary muscle responsible for breathing . The diaphragm is controlled by two nerves running from the brain down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows what causes these nerves to suddenly become excited , but when they do the diaphragm contracts violently , disrupting the normal breathing pattern . When this occurs , the glottis-the valve regulating the direction of air into and out of the lungs-abruptly snaps shut , producing the hiccup sound . Hiccuping persists until the nerves relax again . Dr. Leon Farhi , a professor of physiology at the University of Buffalo in New York , says the nerve irritation may be caused by food traveling down the esophagus and pressing against the nerves controlling the diaphragm . Farhi says that if the hiccups do n't stop , " it 's no laughing matter because you ca n't eat if you are constantly trying to breathe . " Surgery may be required to prevent the chronic hiccuper from starving to death . The irritated nerves can be severed , and the patient will begin to expand and contract his lungs with the chest muscles . " The response to the surgery is instinctual . The nerves coordinating muscle movement of the chest for breathing are wired to the same part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Farhi . " The chest will pull the rib cage up and down , and air will flow into and out of the lungs just like the diaphragm does . " There are no guaranteed cures for the hiccups , but placing an ice cube on both sides of the Adam 's apple may soothe the nerve controlling the diaphragm . Besides water , what other substances can turn to gas from a solid , skipping the liquid phase ? dejavu1807@aol.com THE PROCESS of solid evaporation , the phase change of matter directly from solid to gas , is known as sublimation . It is particularly noticeable with dry ice ( solidified C02 ) , but under correct conditions of temperature and pressure , many substances can sublime . However , under normal temperatures and pressures encountered on Earth , the sublimation of many solids is negligible . Like any change of phase , sublimation requires a change in the energy of the substance , usually in the form of heat . When a solid is heated , thermal energy is transferred to its atoms . Given enough energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether the atoms then interact as a liquid or gas depends on the electrical properties of the atoms , and on the ambient pressure . Taking only pressure into account , solids are more likely to sublime at low pressures , particularly those well below atmospheric pressure . Low pressure implies that freed atoms can travel longer paths before bumping into other atoms . Once freed from a solid under low pressure , atoms would zip away and seldom interact with other atoms , and would behave collectively as a gas . Under higher pressures , they would bump into other atoms so frequently that the weak chemical forces characteristic of liquids could take hold ; the solid would liquefy rather than undergo sublimation . You can see why a sublimator ( used by chemists to obtain vapors from a solid ) typically involves a heating element applied inside a vacuum chamber . What is heatstroke ? S.P. Port Washington , N.Y HEATSTROKE OCCURS when the body 's natural mechanisms for getting rid of excess heat overload or fail . Humans are thermoregulators . In other words , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of about 98.6E When we 're cold , we shiver to generate heat , for example . When we 're hot , we sweat and the blood vessels near the surface of our skin dilate so that more internal heat can be radiated to the air . This dilation causes a drop in blood pressure , due to the increased volume of blood in the vessels . With this drop in blood pressure , the heart beats faster to ensure that enough blood reaches the cells . If the air surrounding our skin is hotter than our body temperature , we absorb heat from the air instead of expelling it . When this occurs , our " core temperature " - the temperature around the heart and other internal organs-rises . We respond by perspiring more profusely , which can lead to dehydration and interfere with the basic functioning of our cells . That 's why it 's so important to drink lots of fluids , especially water , on hot days . ( Alcohol and caffinated drinks actually promote fluid loss because they stimulate urination . ) A classic symptom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweating because he or she ca n't afford to lose any more fluid without risking severe dehydration and damage to cells . A high core temperature , along with an increased heart rate and loss of fluid , puts an enormous strain on the cardiovascular system , says Dr. David Barmache at the Bess-Kaiser Medical Center in Portland , Oregon . " It 's like a car radiator that has leaked its fluid , but the engine keeps going . " Often , the thermoregulatory center in the brain gets damaged and sends incorrect messages . That 's why people suffering from heatstroke often complain that they 're cold . Heat cramps and heat exhaustion , characterized by muscle spasms , lightheadedness , and sometimes fainting and vomiting , can be precursors to heatstroke if the victim 's temperature is not reduced . So if you suspect that someone is being adversely affected by heat , bring them into an air-conditioned room , or spray them with cool water and fan them . Replenishing their fluids with water or juice is also important , but do n't offer a drink to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heatstroke victims can get difficult and disoriented and might choke on liquids , " explains Barmache . What makes invisible ink visible ? Janusz Lorenc Harrington Park , N.J. UNLIKE NORMAL INK , the dye in ultraviolet-sensitive ink contains pigments that fluoresce , or glow , in UV light . The dye can have different concentrations of fluorescent chemicals , for different applications . The waves from a UV light source , or " black light " as it 's sometimes called , must be in a 350- to 400nanometer range for the ink to be seen . In this range , light is reflected from the fluorescent pigment and becomes visible . When exposed to sunlight , the ink may also be visible because the sun gives off ultraviolet rays . Very bright sunlight generally overwhelms the fluorescent response , however , so the ink remains invisible . Ultraviolet ink is commonly employed with hand stamps for readmission to amusement parks , concerts , museums , or swimming pools . It is also used by clothes manufacturers , who use the ink to draw patterns on cloth to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies and private citizens mark objects so they 're easily identified if stolen . Why does a lead-acid car battery lose its charge after being left on a concrete floor ? mkeeping@nbnet.nb.ca BATTERIES FAIL for a number of reasons . Before we explain these , it 's important to understand how a battery works . Lead-acid car batteries contain six separate cells encased in a plastic box ; several chemicals , including lead , sulfuric acid , and water ; and numerous plates that lead to the positive and negative terminals . The chemicals react with the plates inside the battery to produce a flow of electrons . This flow of electrons constitutes an electrical charge . When a lead-acid battery remains unused for four months or more , lead sulfate begins to form on the plates . The sulfate gradually accumulates and crystallizes , clogging the porous plates until the battery no longer holds a charge . This process is known as sulfation . Extreme temperatures affect both battery performance and engine start-up . In other words , the time at which it 's most difficult to start an engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task because it 's not producing enough charge . " Extremes in temperature put a battery at its weakest state , " says Mike Rogers of Interstate Batteries in Dallas . " To make things worse , both very hot and very cold temperatures require more amps to turn an engine . " A hot engine on a hot day can create temperatures within a battery above 212 deg which leads to corrosion . Extremely cold temperatures reduce battery efficiency and may cause the water inside to freeze and expand , cracking the casing . Since concrete is a poor insulator , it can get quite frigid during the winter . A battery stored on a concrete floor could become cold enough to lose its charge . So store a battery on a block of wood , which acts as an insulator . Why are the months September , October , November , and December the ninth , loth , lith , and 12th months of the year and not the seventh , eighth , ninth , and loth months as their names suggest ? Chris.Studholme@UAlberta . CA YOU CAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ancient Romans , says George Houston of the classics department at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill . Formulated by Romulus , the first king of Rome , who ruled from 753 to 720 B.C. , the Roman calendar had a total of 10 months , starting with March and ending in December . September was the seventh month , October the eighth , and so on . Numa Pompilius , the second king of Rome , created two more months to cover the winter period not represented by the existing calendar : January , named for Janus , the two-faced Roman God of gates and doorways , and February , named for the Roman festival of purification . Thereafter , 12 months became the standard , although September , October , November , and December never changed to fit their suggestive names . Is it harmful to manually downshift a car equipped with an automatic transmission ? Imad Kassis ijkassis@bu.edu MANUALLY SHIFTING with an automatic transmission will do no harm . However , constantly changing gears by hand defeats the purpose of having an automatic transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best combination of fuel economy and performance . The computer contains programming that prevents the engine from being over-revved if the driver downshifts too soon . The automatic transmission will not downshift until the computer allows this to happen . Similarly , a rev-limiting feature keeps the engine from exceeding its maximum speed while accelerating . Since the computer has supreme control over what the transmission does , the driver can not cause any damage . If you prefer the convenience of an automatic but like the added control of a manual , several automatic transmissions have manual shifting features . Porsche 's Tiptronic allows manual shifting of all gears from two switches mounted on the steering wheel . Moving the shift lever , mounted on the center console , forward for upshifts and backward for downshifts controls the transmission as well . The Tiptronic can also serve as a regular automatic transmission when desired . Chrysler 's Autostick offers the same option through a shift lever that the driver moves right for upshifts or left for downshifts . The Autostick also serves as a regular automatic transmission .
