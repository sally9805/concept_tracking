SEPTEMBER 8 , 1995 . Bareheaded in the hot noon sunshine , Rick Smythe kneels in front of the green cotton picker parked in his Washington County , Mississippi , farmyard . His large sunspotted hands and muscular arms are black with oil , his darkly tanned face flush with sweat . Behind him , the absolutely still , white sea stretches to the tree line . Above him , the cloudless midday sky is a hopeful blue . With one smooth motion , he slams the metal door over the heads ( the spindles ) that pluck the bolls from the leafless stalks . Standing , he steps to the side of the giant mechanical picker , a machine that changed the cotton-growing South during the 1950s just as swiftly as the gin did a century and a half before . In the hot , bright light , dwarfed by his fields , Rick looks deceptively small . Yet he 's a big man , 6 ' 2 " , 215 pounds , and at 49 , strong from 24 years of farming . Only the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazel eyes hint at his age . No gray marks his lank , almost shoulderlength , light-brown hair . By this midday , the first day of cotton harvest in the Mississippi Delta , Rick 's wash-faded purple Sewanee T-shirt is splattered with grime and dirt and oil and five hours of heat and nervous sweat . Rick has reason to be nervous . So , too , does his tall , blond wife , Sherry , who waits with Rick , as she does every year , to watch the first machine pick the first cotton on the first day of picking season . Within the next hour they will have a fairly accurate idea of how good  --  or bad  --  the yield really is . After 15 years of marriage to a cotton farmer , Sherry ( a partner in a small gift shop ) has learned patience . She 's counting on this year 's crop to finish their kitchen . They stopped remodeling after the awful 1993 crop , and the countertops are still plywood . A nurse by education , Sherry did n't grow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the life suit her . Before their three children were born , she sometimes helped Rick in the field . This fall Sherry and Rick hope for a replay of the 1994 harvest . Nature was unstintingly generous that year , with the rains and cooler nights that transform this rich earth into fields as densely white as new snow . The good yields and grades and historically high prices of 1994 encouraged Rick and thousands of others across the South to plant as much as they could in 1995 . So the story of this year begins 12 months earlier , a time of bounty and promise in the land of cotton . SEPTEMBER 28 , 1994 . Rick and Sherry are excited . The trailer behind their pickup is jammed tight with cotton as they drive into the yard of the cooperative Black Dog Gin that has served the Smythe farm for two decades . After a poor crop the year before , the fields now overflow . Photograph // " I think I 'll get my countertops , " says Sherry , speaking of the almostcompleted remodeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gin . Back at the field , their three children  --  Will , 11 , Sarah , 9 , and Carter , 5  --  play in the almostfull cotton trailer . They 're farmer 's children . They know , just as Rick did when he was their age , when it 's a good crop . OCTOBER 1994 . Delta farmers did n't finish scrapping ( the final picking to get remnants ) until late in the month . Rains delayed the end of harvest and lowered the quality . Yield ( pounds per acre ) is n't the only thing in a successful crop . Higher grade cotton , typically used in clothes and sheets , is worth more . With steeply rising production costs , Rick needs to pick at least 1,000 pounds per acre to have a decent return . He picked about 1,200 pounds per acre in 1994  --  almost 1,600 bales , not a bad crop by any standard . NOVEMBER 27 , 1994 . Even with a fairly good year and high prices , Sherry is n't going to get the countertops she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rick 's parents , who now live in Greenville , is comfortable . A Vicksburg architect helped them remodel with a fireplace and sitting area off the kitchen . It 's here and at the long dining table on the other side of the pass-through that their family and friends visit . Tonight , as guests gather for supper , the news is mixed . A friend who has been farming longer than Rick lost to a summer hailstorm that destroyed part of his cotton . The 1994 crop will be his last . Another friend still farms , but on leased land . After making barely over a bale an acre in 1993 , he could n't repay production loans and lost his family land . WINTER 1995 . Rick catches up on his recordkeeping and works around the farmyard . He also gets the books in order for Sherry 's gift shop . With the good year in the Delta , there was money to spend , and Sherry and her partner , Angie Zepponi , have had a record year . They 'll go to the markets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FEBRUARY 8 , 1995 . The month and the farming year begin warm and sunny . " The weather is giving us a good break , " Rick says . The empty , sodden fields are starting to dry out . The earth smells faintly of spring . It 's relatively young farmland . Unlike the more accessible Delta land near the rivers and creeks , the fields around Tribbett and Bourbon were n't cleared until the late 1890s . Rick 's grandfather , a Greenville doctor , was the first Smythe to work the property , and Rick 's father was still clearing the cypress bottoms in the 1940s . The unusually warm and dry weather allows Rick to begin subsoiling , deeply tilling the earth , getting it ready . Some of his land has been fallow or was planted in wheat last year . Those fields are expected to be productive for this season 's coming harvest . Of the Smythes ' 1,400 acres , 600 are in cotton . The remaining acres are in a combination of soybeans , corn , milo , and wheat . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cotton , Rick plants corn and milo . APRIL 1 , 1995 . Planting begins , but the chains keep jumping off the planters , which are pulled by tractors . Only a few acres are completed . Rick has taken a chance and started early . A late cold snap or heavy spring rains could mean at least some of the acres will have to be replanted . After a few hours on April Fools ' Day , Rick and his crew put in a full day on Sunday , April 2 , and then work for six straight days planting 600 acres of cotton . In his largest field , the rows stretch out for a mile . When the crew finishes , the ground is dry and dusty  --  and the seeds need rain . " My guys know this is n't a 9 to 5 , Monday to Friday job , " Rick says . " They are pretty aware of what 's going on . At a particular time when the land will work , it does n't pay to wait till Monday . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been with him the longest . This will be their 16th crop together . " Oscar knows what the cotton needs , and he knows what we need to do , " Rick says . " He moved away to Chicago and California , and then he came home . He 's a natural farmer . " APRIL 10 , 1995 . The seeds get the needed rain  --  about 2 inches . Thankfully the warm weather continues . If spring holds , the cotton will be off to a strong start . One week later , at Easter , the first tiny , fragile plants break through the ground . Four days later Rick 's tractors are back in the fields , cultivating between the rows to control weeds that can choke off the seedlings . The cotton is up and looking good . But the weather does n't hold . On April 19 a spell of monsoon rains begins with a 2-inch downpour . Water stands between the rows . It continues through the weekend and turns cold . At one point , about a third of one field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much worse news . Oscar dies suddenly on Thursday , April 27 . When he did n't show up for work , Rick went to check on him . " He was in his bed ; the doctors said he had a stroke , " Rick says . Six days later , on a rainy Wednesday , Oscar is laid to rest . " We buried him in the thicket on his family land west of Tribbett , " Rick says . " The men and I dug his grave . My guys were all there in workclothes . We laid him in the ground and covered his grave . We had to go on from there . I 'm going to be buried on my own land . " MAY 1995 . The cool , wet weather continues to the detriment of the young cotton . During the first week , nighttime temperatures sink to the forties with little daytime warming . Cotton does n't grow when it gets this cool . Even with the chilly weather , Rick starts to replant the cotton damaged by the heavy April rains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  filling in gaps . By the second week of May , the farming is in full swing . Rick 's men cultivate and begin spraying herbicides under the young cotton to control the fast-growing coco nutsedge grass . But Oscar 's death has put a damper on the spring . " It 's been really hard without him . I 've just been going through the motions , " Rick says . " If I had a problem , I 'd get Oscar to ride the fields with me , and he always seemed to know what we needed to do . He 's impossible to replace . " JUNE 1995 . The rains stop and the weather becomes hot , good cottongrowing weather . " For the most part the cotton is there . It 'll just take a while for it to fill out in places , " Rick says . " Mbe warm , dry weather for the last three weeks of May really helped the cotton out , and it 's starting to look halfway decent . I think we can make a good crop if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children are at home . Will wants to be a farmer too . At barely 12 , he 's already aware of the pitfalls . " He 's heard adults talk , " says Sherry . " And one time he asked if we were going to go bankrupt " June goes from hot to oppressive , the heat taking a toll on Rick and his men . By the second week , the temperatures climb to 95 degrees . They continue cultivating and spraying herbicides as the cotton grows . By the middle of the month , the crop is about knee-high . On Friday , June 16 , Rick finds the first bloom  --  and it 's pink , a second-day bloom ( cotton blooms emerge white ) . The heat and the early planting are speeding the crop along . For his fields , the first blooms arrive three to five days earlier than usual . JUNE 27 , 1995 . It 's been three weeks since it rained , but it is n't critical . The cotton has n't lost any yield ( the number and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delta , farmers , and all the people who depend on them , pray for rain . They are also concerned about the infestation of aphids , destructive insects that suck juices from leaves and stems . Farmers try to get an emergency dispensation from the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to use an unauthorized but highly effective chemical . Late in the afternoon , Rick stops by to see Da Da Lewis at his flying service and contracts for the next morning . He decides he ca n't wait for the EPA edict . The aphids are rapacious . He contracts for Da Da to aerial spray with one of the EPA-approved , expensive but less effective , insecticides . Then with their friend Kevin , Rick and Sherry have a rare weekday dinner out in nearby Greenville . After dinner , they play for an hour at one of the two river casinos in town . Sherry and Kevin win at roulette . The win proves a good omen ; by the time they get home , the sky has clouded over , with heat lightning on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before their usual 5 a.m. alarm . No aerial spraying today , but the rain has come in time . They sleep late and cook a big breakfast for the children . When Rick goes out to check the rain gauge later in the morning , it registers 0.8 inch . " We had only half an inch over the past month , so we really need this , " he says . " Cotton starts drinking water after the middle of June when it 's blooming . " JULY 4 , 1995 . It rains another inch by Rick 's calculation . The cotton crop grows in the humid heat , sun , and moisture of the Mississippi Delta . On July 5 , it rains again . He is n't sure how much  --  but it was more than needed . The field work has slowed . Now is a time of waiting and watching and hoping for good weather . AUGUST 1995 . Rick rates his cotton for his own records . " The big question is  --  is it going to be 90% of a three-bale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crop ? What happens with the weather from now on will determine that . " It has n't rained since July 5 . " The heat is killing us and not doing the cotton any good , " Rick says . " It 's not getting below 75 degrees , sometimes 80 degrees at night , and the cotton has to cool off to finish filling out . Plus we did n't get any rain this month . " SEPTEMBER 1 , 1995 . The early planting followed by heat and drought has matured the cotton bolls . About a week earlier than last year , Rick starts defoliating . The flying service he uses sprays a chemical defoliant on the fields . The leaves of the plant dry and fall off , reducing trash in the machine-picked cotton . Picking begins about a week later . " If I had known in April and May what I know now , I 'd have replanted more , " Rick explains . " Some of my cotton is pretty damn poor , but some looks pretty damn good too . " SEPTEMBER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and misty . By midmorning the clouds burn off . Both cotton pickers need lastminute adjustments , and Rick must drive to Greenville to get a part . Finally , a little after noon , Rick and Sherry watch as a picker lumbers from the farmyard to the field behind their house . The sun is directly overhead in the cloudless day . Henry Williams , the driver , eases down the heads , and the 10 year-old machine lurches into the sea of white . It sways over the rows , ungainly yet stable as it moves slowly forward . The basket fills with white locks , plucked and blown from the ripe bolls into the mesh basket . " That ai n't a bad dab of cotton , " Rick says , wiping the sweat from his oil-streaked face . " Maybe this field will pick as well as last year . Maybe we underestimated . " Unfortunately Rick had n't . By the end of the day , when refigured , the yield is down . Cool , wet May , aphid-infested June , and torrid August took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues until a cold rain sets in on the afternoon of September 21 . Rick and his men have worked for 13 straight days , harvesting 540 bales from 370 acres . The fields dry out , and picking resumes on September 23 . At month 's end , the first picking is over . For the next 19 days , they scrap the fields . The tally is n't the best year for the Smythes , but it certainly is n't among the worst . Their 600 acres yielded 860 pounds per acre or 1,054 bales of cotton . The weather was much crueler to farmers in usually productive Warren County to the south , in the hill counties to the east , and in Alabama and Georgia . THANKSGIVING , NOVEMBER 23 , 1995 . With family and guests around their table and their kitchen finally finished with new countertops , Rick and Sherry consider themselves blessed . The laughter and food and friends celebrate the end of one harvest and the beginning of another . During November , Rick works  --  cutting stalks , tilling , and rowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest under the heavy fall sky , rest for another cycle of planting , cultivating , and harvesting from this dark , fertile dirt . <p>
