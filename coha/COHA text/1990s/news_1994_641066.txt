<p> Even as Colorado State University president Al Yates takes heat for a raise that will lift his base pay by $ 24,000 a year , to nearly $ 157,000 , he actually may rank a bit below the national salary average for his profession . <p> Base pay for presidents of public research universities such as CSU was just under $ 133,000 annually , according to the last comprehensive national survey , done in 1991 . <p> Yates currently receives $ 132,992 in direct salary , plus an additional $ 49,000 a year for housing , entertainment and personal expenses . Given the fact that the salary survey of presidents is about 3 years old , his overall compensation probably is below what now is being paid on the competitive market . <p> Those types of subtleties , however , have n't kept the public spotlight off the CSU president . The announcement last month that Yates ' base pay will leap ahead of the salaries paid to University of Colorado president Judith Albino ( $ 150,000 ) and Colorado School of Mines president George Ansell ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Rep. Tony Grampsas , an Evergreen Republican who serves as vice chairman of the Joint Budget Committee , said most state employees are living with a salary freeze . Why , he said , " are we in a race to see who can be the state 's highest-paid college president ? " <p> CSU publicists and members of the school 's governing board insist that is n't the case . <p> They say $ 5,000 of Yates ' increase actually is a raise . The other $ 19,000 is " new " pay in recognition of his duties as chancellor of the CSU system , which includes his Fort Collins campus , the University of Southern Colorado in Pueblo and Fort Lewis College in Durango . <p> The system loosely linking the three schools has existed for almost 10 years , and Yates serves as its leader on legislative and budget issues . <p> But the presidents of Fort Lewis and USC rank as the top administrators on their campus , and they are accountable to the governing board . <p> The board , formally called the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land-grant school , announced Yates ' pay increase late on a Friday afternoon . <p> The information came at least five months after the salary arrangement with him had been struck , further rankling legislators . <p> Sen. Al Meiklejohn , an Arvada Republican who heads the Senate Education Committee , said he regards Yates as an able president but still questions a $ 24,000 pay raise in what is supposed to be a climate of austerity . <p> Meiklejohn also does n't buy the argument that the amount of Yates ' increase is justified because he is handling two jobs . <p> The senator calls that explanation " hogwash , " and points out that Yates ' predecessor at CSU , Phil Austin , also held the title of system chancellor . <p> Austin , hired by the University of Alabama in 1989 , did n't receive separate or additional pay because of the chancellor 's duties at CSU . <p> Grampsas said that large increases for Yates or other university executives seem out of step for 1994 . <p> " I 'm not happy to hear this at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . <p> Colorado now operates under the strictures of voter-approved Amendment 1 , which limits governments in how much they can tax and spend . <p> The amendment may make compensation packages for university executives more sensitive . University of Colorado regents unanimously granted Albino a two-year contract extension in September , but say they have n't negotiated yet with Albino on the financial terms . <p> Fulginiti 's pay highest <p> Colorado 's highest-paid university administrator is neither Yates nor Albino . <p> That distinction belongs to Vincent Fulginiti , a physician who serves as chancellor of the CU Health Sciences Center . <p> Fulginiti 's salary is $ 285,000 a year . He does n't receive the array of perquisites , such as free housing , that other top campus administrators command . <p> Nationally , medical school administrators and top medical professors typically are the highest paid of any in the groves of academe . <p> They usually rank ahead of other top echelons of university employees - business school deans and football and basketball coaches at major schools . <p> Coaches often make substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and radio shows , athletic camps and speaking appearances . <p> The highest-paid college employee in the nation in the 1991 survey was Wayne Isom , a professor of cardiothoracis surgery at Cornell University in New York . <p> His salary and benefits package totaled nearly $ 1.8 million . <p> An associate professor in the same department at Cornell received $ 1.3 million . <p> The school president , Frank Rhodes , has made about $ 260,000 . <p> Housing allowances <p> The national salary survey also showed most four-year colleges and universities either provide homes for their presidents or give them housing allowances that average more than $ 27,000 a year . <p> Albino lives free in a university-owed home , as do the presidents of a handful of Colorado 's 13 four-year schools . <p> But the state does n't own a presidential residence in Fort Collins , so Yates receives a housing allowance of $ 34,000 a year as one of his prime perquisites . <p> Presidents of smaller colleges in cities such as Gunnison and Grand Junction receive about half that much each year for housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $ 5,600 a year . <p> Most Colorado colleges and universities provide this perquisite for their chief executives , though the amount varies a bit from campus to campus . <p> Overall , Colorado 's top college administrators are compensated much like their peers across the country , but many of them do n't fit the national " profile " of presidents . <p> And that could actually make them hot properties on the job market as colleges elsewhere try to diversify their leadership ranks by hiring more women and ethnic minorities . <p> The salary survey , which was administered by the College and University Personnel Association of Washington , D.C. , found that an American college president is typically 54 years old and had held his position for at least about seven years . <p> " His " is important here , because only 11 percent of college presidents in the 1991 survey were women . Eight percent were ethnic minorities . <p> On Colorado 's four largest campuses , CU-Boulder , CSU , Metropolitan State College and the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley , none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNC President Herman Lujan is Hispanic , and the CU and Metro presidents are women . <p> A pay increase seems only a matter of time for Albino . <p> At the regents ' September meeting - in which the regents voted to retain her for at least two more years - they said a raise probably would be negotiated before her new contract formally kicks in next spring . <p> At least one president , Kaye Howe of Western State College in Gunnison , has quietly rejected a raise . <p> Howe was offered a 3.2 percent increase last year . <p> But she turned down the additional money on grounds that other state employees on her campus were n't getting raises . She also deferred , until May 1994 , hikes in her housing and vehicle allowances.NATIONAL AVERAGES OF SALARIES <p> Public research university , such as CU or CSU $ 132,800 <p> Private or independent research university $ 238,000 <p> Average for all schools in this category $ 141,500 <p> Other universities that grant doctoral degrees <p> Public $ 118,600 <p> Private , independent $ 152,400 <p> Average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's degrees ) <p> Public $ 106,600 <p> Private , independent $ 137,400 <p> Average $ 111,700 <p> In addition : <p> Sixty percent of reporting colleges and universities owned a residence or offered housing allowance at average $ 27,308 per year . <p> The average auto allowance was $ 5,598 per year . <p> SOURCE : College and University Personnel Association , Washington , D.C.
