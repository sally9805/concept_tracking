The Notorious B.I.G. , a.k.a . Biggie Smalls , a.k.a . Christopher Wallace , was living large . Life was sweet , good , like something out of a song . Here he was , all 6 ft. 3 in. and 300-some pounds of him , grown up and successful . Back in the day , he had been just another fat kid , a no-account who could n't get girls , could n't finish high school , slinging crack for near nothing on a street corner in Brooklyn . Then he discovered gangsta rap . His first album , Ready to Die , sold more than a million copies , and his follow-up , Life After Death , scheduled to drop on March 25 , was the talk of the rap world . Wallace had already landed the cover of the hip-hop magazine the Source , and he was set to have lunch with TIME 's pop music critic in a week . Now here he was at a star-studded party in L.A. that Vibe magazine was hosting to celebrate the Soul Train Music Awards on March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there . Wallace was floating on good vibes . It was like a song . <P> But it was a gangsta rap song . More than 1,700 people crowded into the Peterson Automotive Museum , where the party was being held , and the crush was too much . Around midnight the fire marshal ordered the festivities shut down . Wallace went to his truck . A friend took the wheel of the GMC Suburban , and the rapper got into the passenger seat ( he did n't have a driver 's license ) . Moments after they left the parking lot , according to witnesses , a lone gunman in a passing car fired several shots from a 9-mm handgun through the passenger side of the vehicle , hitting the 24-year-old rapper . He died on the way to the hospital . <P> Wait . Have n't we heard this story before ? Is this the remix ? It was just six months ago that Tupac Shakur , one of the West Coast 's most charismatic and popular gangsta rappers , was slain in a similar drive-by shooting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast 's biggest rap stars , is dead too . Like Shakur , Biggie had foretold his own demise . On the dirgelike song You 're Nobody , from his forthcoming CD , he raps , " You 're nobody/ Till somebody kills you . " <P> Indeed , in the wake of Wallace 's death , as with Shakur 's , records bearing his name sold out in stores nationwide ; the new CD is expected to be a hot seller . Americans have long been drawn to the symbiosis between criminal life and pop culture  --  from Frank Sinatra and his alleged mobster pals to the success of the Godfather saga , which is scheduled for an anniversary re-release this week , to the fact that John Gotti 's daughter has a new novel out . In the case of gangsta rap , however , the music , though often purchased by suburban whites , is primarily identified with a segment of society , young black males , that is particularly ravaged by crime . Is gangsta mythologizing for people already living under the gun a form of release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introspection . Says Warren G , whose record company , fearing for his safety , postponed the promotional tour for his new album Take a Look over Your Shoulder : " This has gone too far . It 's making us look like animals . " Says rapper Ahmir of the progressive Philadelphia hip-hop band the Roots : " I thought Tupac 's death was a wake-up call . I guess we hit the snooze button . " Adds Wyclef of the socially conscious hip-hop band the Fugees : " We all need to chill out for a second and step back . It 's just entertainment , after all . "
