A 75-gun salute is in order for this red-white-and-blue organization that tips its hat to the past , but has its eye on the future . <p> Today , some would have you believe that cynicism is in vogue and patriotism out of style . They 're wrong . Yankee Doodle lives , and you do n't have to go far to find him . Just stop by any American Legion post , and you 'll discover do-or-die nephews ( and nieces ) of Uncle Sam ready to go to bat for Americans anytime , anywhere . These citizen-soldiers are neither uncertain about what they stand for nor shy about declaring it to the world . <p> Drop in on Banner Day at a local elementary school , talk to a teenager at Boys or Gifts State , judge a Legion-sponsored high-school oratorical contest , chat with the American Legion Scout of the Year , watch the real national pastime at a Legion baseball park , or just wave Old Glory the next time Legionnaires parade down Main Street , U.S.A. , and you 'll see what patriotism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The concepts and values upon which our country is founded are alive and well in these places  --  and in the hearts and minds of some three million Legionnaires across the land . They cherish the old verities of honor , courage , vigilance , service , sacrifice , and the rule of law . To a Legionnaire , these words are not merely old-fashioned ideals consigned to the neglected pages of outdated history books . They are words to live by . Strength through Diversity <p> The men and women of the American Legion come from all age groups , ethnic origins , socioeconomic classes , and political parties . This wellspring of human talent keeps the organization strong and vital . What keeps them united is one immutable common bond : they are all Americans  --  and proud of it . <p> " We believe a veteran is a veteran , and benefits and rehabilitation are nonpartisan issues , " says E. Roy Stone , Jr. , chairman of the South Carolina State Agency of Vocational Rehabilitation , who has served the Legion on the national level for 48 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have served our country , often at great personal sacrifice , deserve the nation 's appreciation and support . <p> " If something is good for veterans , the Legion will be for it , " Stone says . <p> In return , the Legion established its mission to serve not only veterans , but also the community , American youth , and the nation . And this self-supporting veterans ' organization , which recently celebrated 75 years of service , has raised countless millions to deliver on that promise . Veterans ' Programs for All Americans <p> Each time the winds of war subside , returning veterans must face the often-difficult adjustment to family and community . Since 1919 , the American Legion has done battle on the homefront to provide programs and services to ease veterans ' reentry into a peacetime America , a peace secured by their hardships and sacrifices on the battlefield . <p> Their achievements are impressive . They lobbied for the World War Veteran 's Act of 1924 , which established , among other things , standards for veteran rehabilitation . Legionnaires launched national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and medical assistance to disabled veterans and their families ; set up unemployment services , and establish a federal Veterans Administration . In Memoriam : Those Who Sacrificed for America <p> Ever important to the American Legion is the appropriate honor and dignity with which Americans remember the debt this nation owes those who have fallen in battle . <p> In large measure , credit goes to a special Legion project for beautifying and dignifying the tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery . When the tomb was being chipped away by souvenir hunters in 1937 , the Legion pushed for a 24-hour military guard . In addition , the Legion ( and its auxiliary ) raised funds for permanent lighting of the tomb . <p> On November 13 , 1982 , a memorial was finally dedicated in the nation 's capital to honor Vietnam veterans , who had often encountered disrespect and scorn when they returned home from battle in that unpopular war . The American Legion was the largest contributor ( $1.2 million ) to the project . Jan C. Scruggs , president of the Vietnam Veterans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players in getting the memorial built and financing its construction . <p> Even military personnel buried abroad are not forgotten . The Legion 's Overseas Decoration Trust provides flags and other decorations for graves of GIs buried on foreign soil . Fighting for Veterans ' Unique Health Concerns <p> Champions of healthcare for veterans , the Legion has labored tirelessly to demand that government acknowledge responsibility and provide medical assistance to veterans suffering from problems acquired directly from military service . <p> Recently , victims of Agent Orange received much-needed aid when the Legion , along with Columbia University , confirmed the link between the defoliant and disease . The Legion also supported studies that revealed posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) to be the underlying cause of many serious readjustment problems affecting veterans of all wars , not just Vietnam . The Legion then persuaded the Veterans Administration to provide treatment , counseling , social services , and employment assistance to PTSD sufferers . <p> A Legion task force is still campaigning for benefits for veterans suffering from the effects of mustard gas , asbestos , atomic radiation , government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1991 Gulf War . The GI Bill : A Work in Progress <p> But chief among the Legion 's accomplishments is the GI Bill of 1944 ( updated to help veterans of the Korean , Vietnam , and the Gulf wars ) . <p> " In my view , the GI Bill of Rights , passed in 1944 , is the most important piece of legislation produced by the Congress in this century , " said William J. Crowe , Jr. , former : chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . " It was an act initiated , sponsored , and sold by the American Legion , " he added . <p> The program benefited all citizens by educating and training veterans to enter the job market in postwar America . Employed vets paid , rather than drained , taxes from public-assistance programs . <p> Through Legion-guaranteed home loans , vets reentered the American economy , stimulating the real-estate market and increasing the consumption of household goods , appliances , and everything that goes into making a home and family . These tough , dedicated citizen-soldiers , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played a leading role in making America into the world superpower that we know today . Commitment to American Youth <p> Of late , much has been said about how " it takes a whole village to raise a child " and that we must all take an interest in the health , welfare , and education of our young people . Scholars and politicians alike warn that the younger generation has little understanding of American history or the principles and values that made this country the great republic that it is . <p> These are not new ideas to Legionnaires . As far back as the 1920s , Legionnaires saw the need to care for and provide direction to the nation 's youth , particularly the children of disabled or fallen comrades . They proposed : " The child of every veteran should have a home , health , education , character , and opportunity . " And they put their money where their proposition was by including children 's programs in a $5 million Veterans ' Rehabilitation Endowment Fund . Building Good Citizens Through Scouting <p> Even earlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Local posts to date have chartered more than 2,400 units , and hundreds more receive financial assistance and countless volunteer hours . The Legion also awards competitive scholarships annually to Eagle Scouts . Batter Up ! <p> Concern for the physical fitness of America 's youth resulted in the formation of American Legion Junior Baseball in 1925 . Thomas A. Rumer , author of The American Legion : An Official History , 1919-1989 , wrote that an additional impetus for sponsoring the national program came from the director of the Legion 's Americanism Commission , Frank C. Cross , who was determined to " fight the seamier aspects of ' professionalism ' in amateur sports . " <p> Cross averred that the Legion was " more than a match for avaricious moneychangers who seek to defile the temple of sportsmanship by bartering in amateur sports . " <p> The program has run virtually uninterrupted ever since , claiming among its alumni 32 Hall of Famers , including Ted Williams , Bob Feller , Stan Musial , Yogi Berra , Carl Yastrzemski , Jim Palmer , and Reggie Jackson . <p> Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 18-year-old high-school students from all 50 states and Puerto Rico competed in state tourneys . The 1995 American Legion World Series was held in August in Fargo , North Dakota , with the champions winning a trip to the Major League World Series . Preparing the Statesmen of the Future <p> Sixty years ago , the first American Legion Boys State citizenship program convened in Springfield , Illinois . Boys State , which is centered around the study of local and state government , was inaugurated to counter a 1930s Fascist movement organized to win students from Middle America 's high schools . <p> This week-long summer program for qualified young men ( the Legion Auxiliary sponsors Girls State ) between the junior and senior years in high school trains youth for practical citizenship . Goals include the development of civic pride and an understanding of American traditions and government . Most important are goals " to inculcate a sense of individual obligation to the community , state , and nation " and " to safeguard and transmit to posterity the principles of justice , freedom , and democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , D.C. , for Boys Nation , which concentrates on federal government . Boning Up , Speaking Out <p> The Legion also sponsors a National Oratorical Contest to develop in high-school students a deeper understanding and appreciation of the Constitution of the United States by having them select and research a phrase of the Constitution that emphasizes duties and obligations of citizens to their government . Other objectives are to develop leadership and to help students learn to think and speak clearly and intelligently . Scholarships totaling $60,000 go to the four finalists . Need a Lift to College ? <p> The American Legion ( in cooperation with National College Services and United Student Aid Funds ) annually publishes an assistance package titled Need a Lift ? This book , available in most high schools or on an individual basis , offers a comprehensive list of scholarships , grants , and loan opportunities ; specific information on many colleges and universities ; applications for financial aid ; and career-development information . Taking Good Care of America 's Children <p> The Legion 's Child Welfare Foundation and the Commission on Children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs , reduce juvenile delinquency , wipe out physical and sexual abuse of infants and children , and strengthen families . They fund dozens of other organizations that work for the benefit of children ( such as the Red Cross , cancer-research programs , and camps for handicapped children ) . They even underwrite publications such as Living With IBD , a book for children who suffer from Crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis . What About the Community as a Whole ? <p> The number and variety of community programs supported by the Legion is limited only by the energy and ingenuity of individual Legionnaires . Each post can implement programs to meet any community need  --  as long as members raise the money and volunteer the hours necessary to get the job done . <p> The Legion 's National Emergency Fund , along with thousands of volunteers , helps victims of such tragedies as hurricanes in Florida , earthquakes in California , floods in the Midwest , and the recent Oklahoma City bombing . And they will be there when next they 're needed . Long May She Wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearts and minds of Legionnaires  --  and woe be to those who would desecrate it ! <p> " Our Legion comrades . . . at that first convention made it clear that they had not carried the American flag abroad to return home and see it degraded in the land of its birth , " said former president Harry S Truman in 1959 and quoted in the American Legion magazine in 1994 . <p> While others may remain unclear about their position on a Constitutional amendment to protect the flag from public desecration , the Legion leaves no room for doubt . At its 1994 spring convention , the Legion declared , " There 's no turning back from our commitment to the flag . " To show they meant business , delegates approved additional funding to the Citizens Flag Alliance to continue the campaign to protect the flag . <p> As in the past , the American Legion 's primary mission is to serve our nation 's veterans . But , perhaps more important , the Legion can be counted on to continue serving communities , America 's youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Legion has always remained true to its motto : " For God and Country !

In sum , the blue and gold emblem stands for truth , remembrance , honor , service , rehabilitation , child welfare , loyalty , and Americanism . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Legion founders convened at the Paris Caucus in 1919 to set the group 's goals , principles , and mission .
