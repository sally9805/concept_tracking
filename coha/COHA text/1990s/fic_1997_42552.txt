He was walking down the highway , Ohio SR 4 between Union City and Butler , singing at the top of his voice . He carried a green plaid suit in a clear plastic garment bag . He did not bother to hitchhike , to actually turn every now and then and lift a thumb . By the city limits sign he had little expectation of catching a ride . <p> He had been walking for thirty minutes , sweating heavily before he had reached the city limits sign some six miles behind him now . He was free from jail and that was the important news , despite the dust and the sweat and the flies that somehow found him there on the road . At least he was out , out from counting the days . Out from skirting the taunts and near-fights at mealtime , from the deep silences in the cells , those silences he swam through toward sleep . Out , and above all he could float now , his head high and breathing the cool and needful breath of freedom . Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The suit was a prize won in a tonk game his first afternoon in jail . After his run-in with Late Hit , a man with watery eyes had pushed into his hand a list of job openings around the county <p> " Good luck ; ' the man had whispered . Mote 's quick scan of the list revealed only a few jobs he qualified for-a cook , stock boy , mill laborer . The folded list rode in his hip pocket now . <p> Up ahead in Union City a few friends knew him as " The Shark " the one who guarded his territory and sought blood when provoked . At least that was what the more fearful ones called him , the two or three he had managed to intimidate over the past few years . But where were even those few when " The Shark " was a captive for three days in the county jail ? He smiled a sad smile . No doubt they thought he could crash his way out , ripping through the steel bars as if they were the chalk-brittle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mote . He was a man who could tell a good joke every now and then and never carried a weapon . <p> At first the bus seemed the reasonable way to get home . He had eleven dollars in his pocket , more than enough for a one-way ticket . With no one meeting him upon his release he briefly thought of hitchhiking back as some form of revenge . Certainly a cab was out of the question . That was the way Badfoot Tony came home after a night in the Dayton jail , stepping from a Yellow Cab with grand lies , ready to keep everyone laughing all summer long . But less than twenty minutes ago the bus ticket agent had told Mote that he had just missed the last bus north for three hours . <p> " Cutbacks , " the man said , scratching grizzle , then shrugging . " Hey , . what can you do ? " <p> Mote could be nearly home in three hours . By car he was only twenty minutes from Big Edna 's front door , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning he had talked softly to himself . <p> " Yeah , I can hitch me a ride home in all that time and save my scratch for a juicy Big Boy . " He easily conjured the smell of french fries and the special sauce of the double-decker hamburger oozing warmly down his thumb . <p> The downtown streets of Butler had been quiet with only a few shoppers strolling in the late Thursday morning , occasional cars for traffic . Just three blocks from the county jail he had started sweating . Against his back rode the bright green suit which he carried on a hanger , one finger hooking its curved end . He had paused , spotted a dry cleaner 's shop , and moved toward it . He pushed inside with a smile on his face . A middle-aged woman stood behind the counter , writing quickly across pink receipts . " Excuse me , Miss , but do y'all got a extra bag I could buy ? " The woman looked up , leaned , then smiled . " Just for that one suit ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old bag . " She took the suit and hanger from him and placed it on a tall metal hook next to the cash register . He smelled a faint lemon perfume , noticed her tight jeans . Like drawing a curtain , she tore off a swath of cellophane , pinched an opening , and quickly covered the suit . <p> " This do ? " she asked . The diamonds in her wedding ring stunned him . <p> He was holding the suit again before he spoke . " Yes , yes , this 'll do just fine . Keep the dust and bugs off the suit , you know : ' " What kind of cleaner 's you go to do n't give you a bag ? " she asked . " Well , they was running just a little short this morning , I do believe . " <p> She waved a finger . " You just think of us first next time . No way we send a customer out with his suit clean but naked to the breeze . " <p> The suit was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen the smudges at the front pockets of the trousers , the spot on the front coat sleeve made from a dollop of coleslaw , maybe . Might have smelled , too , if she leaned very close , the dried perspiration , not his , like the smell of iron at the armpits of the suit . If she did notice any of this , she was too kind to say so and very shrewd at drumming up business . <p> At the first intersection he found an empty public phone booth , ran a finger around the coin return , then stepped back with a frown . After the bad news at the station he had begun to walk with purpose . For the next few blocks , he put up his thumb , not even turning when he heard traffic approaching from the rear . There were no takers . Though his luck was always mixed weather , he had a feeling that rain was his only future ahead . <p> Soon the businesses-the quick-change tire places , the onestory motels and bars-had thinned out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Union City and points north . He passed the last of the burger and fries places already floating its rich smell to the morning , a smell that weakened his knees . That morning for breakfast he had oatmeal , warm milk , and limp toast with just the threat of butter . He swallowed and again resolved not to stop yet for food . But he remembered joking with one of the trustees , a wiry man the world had nicknamed " Forty . " <p> " Least a man about to be set free ought to have a meal to remember y'all by , " Mote had said . Forty had nodded and attempted a smile . " Such a man ought to get a meal that 'll teach his dumb ass to stay out of jail . " Forty reached around for a palm to slap . None offered . Around them other prisoners ate , traded jokes or baseball stories . One or two stared into space . <p> " I bet that 's what keep you here , Forty , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hell , Cox ; " the wiry man had said . " I done you one favor cutting you in on the tonk game . I do n't owe you a damned thing else . " <p> Mote had finished his breakfast , then chuckled as he backed out of the noisy room . He would be a free man within an hour , never to see Forty again , at least in drab jailhouse issue . <p> Mote 's grand wish for the day was to get home before his aunt Edna returned from her job . Thursdays were the days she sat on the front porch immediately after work , talking loudly with Miss Hester or any of the other women walking past the house . If he got home too late , his shame would be very public , halting conversation or laughter . No , he would much prefer to be home first , to suffer wrath behind closed doors for a day or so . <p> One car honked as it sped past , someone whooped from another . Then a car slowed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied to the car body with two wire coat hangers . A front tire bumped the curb twice , shaking the fender . A man in a cowboy hat leaned out . <p> " Can I get you anywhere , partner ? " " I 'm going ten miles up the road , " Mote said . " Well , I ca n't take you that far , but I can get you three , four miles closer anyway . " <p> The inside of the Bonneville smelled of equal parts cigarette smoke and pine . The driver slapped the top of the dashboard as they rolled away . <p> " Ca n't provide you much entertainment on account the radio 's busted . Been after my brother-in-law to fix the dad-blamed thing , but you ca n't squeeze water from a rock . When he ai n't halfworking or racing cars around the mud track over there in Franklin , he home on the back porch drinking beer . " Mote smiled . He noticed a long scar across the back of the stranger 's hand . Then the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rippled in the wind coming through the back window . <p> " Nice suit you got there , " the man said . " You headed somewheres special , I bet . A wedding ? " <p> " No . " The last of the neighborhoods were thinning out to the cornfields north of Butler . He was still sweating from the walking . " No , there 's a big dance coming up tonight and they ca n't start without me . " <p> The man slapped the wheel this time and laughed loudly . " You mean to tell me I 'm driving around a full-blown celebrity ? " <p> Mote figured the man on his own could quickly conclude that celebrities do not take ten-mile hikes on weekday mornings , that they hitchhike only if their shiny new cars break down in a cloud of smoke . <p> " Well , I do n't know about all that , " Mote said . He then proceeded to tell the man about his release from a hospital . Minor surgery on his back , three days ' recovery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man , that ca n't be no fun someone cutting on your back and now you having to walk and all . By the way , the name 's Youstler . Good friends just call me Vernon . " <p> Mote took the offered hand and introduced himself . Then he asked , " You live back there in Butler ? " <p> " Me ? Uh-uh . I was just checking on a horse a old boy wants to sell me . Horse he showed me was n't in too good a shape , if you want to know the truth . Me , I live on a farm just up a ways here . Got a few cows and horses , but mostly corn , you know . But a fellow ca n't hardly make it farming these days . That 's how come my car damned near older than my marriage . " <p> Vernon Youstler spat out of his window . " You surely welcome to drop in and have lunch with me and my wife . Nothing 's ever fancy on our table , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean . <p> " I 'm in a big hurry to get home . " He glanced at Youstler . " I thank you much for your invitation . " <p> " Suit yourself . Remember the welcome mat 's out and you got a couple more miles to think about it . " <p> Mote was tempted to take up the offer . Among bright fields he might find a boisterous place-dogs barking , radio loud from inside the house , the riot of children at play . Inside , the house might smell of fried onions , his favorite smell next to french fries . He could eat there , nap surely , then be back on the highway in less than ninety minutes . But no , no . Big Edna might be home early . Besides , instead of a lunch so efficiently prepared , he might be there alone , this Youstler . He might have chased a son into the Air Force , a daughter to a husband who apologized for work , and a wife who fled to her parents . Yes , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the night , or murdering strangers who hitchhiked into the small circle he stalked and counting their severed toes each midnight . Crazy folks were everywhere these days , Mote had long concluded . He did not need newspapers to tell him that . <p> At the turnoff , Mote thanked the man , lifted out his suit . Youstler presented him with a ripe orange . " Do n't do anything I would n't do . " Then he waved and roared off down a gravel road that seemed to have no end , but curved sharply into a grove of maples . <p> Mote pushed the orange into a back pocket , then moved on . By the time he had regained his original walking speed , the memory of jail washed back over him . During the first night there he wondered about his stupid acts from the past-stealing hubcaps , car batteries . In the near dark he regretted for the first time stealing fruit from the large outdoor bins that ringed the closest Krogers , regretted the fruit trees robbed , then running with friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners or the sound of a shotgun shell pumped into a chamber . Such petty things . In jail he heard of even grander schemes , of plots that would retire men before they were forty years of age . All around him those few days were men , twenty to twenty-five years old , all moving in and out , who were there only because of bad luck or a mental lapse . <p> ( " I forgot to put the damn mask on before I got up to the counter . She must have hit the button while I was pulling it on . " ) ( " How was I to know somebody was at home ? I counted two cars at the place , so they 're both gone , see ? And the same top light is on like when they 're away . I 'm halfway in the back door when the light goes on . I haul ass but they still got a good look at me some kind of way , know what I 'm saying ? Was n't for the bad luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cleveland somewhere ordering drinks for the whole goddamned bar . " ) <p> ( " My luck , the homeless guy wanting a spoon is narco . " ) ( " My idea was to shoot out the bank camera . So I come in behind a couple people , then I slide along the wall . When I 'm just under the camera , I pop up and give a hit . But the first shot misses , see ? The second one gets it good . My partner got everybody covered . Well , we get the money and run . But next morning my picture on the front page , showing sparks from the gun and shit . I 'm at my girlfriend 's on my second can of root beer when they bust in . " ) <p> Quirks of fate herded them together , nothing more . The county jail smelled of Lifebuoy soap and piss . The stances of the ones in for the first time amused him , like high schoolers posing in front of lockers before the first bell . Mote imitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the steel mill . A few called each other by first name . Mote spoke to them all upon eye contact . " Hey , slick , " he 'd say or " What 's up ? " Someone told him to never smile in the holding tank . Ask and give no favors . No one in there could be your friend . <p> But where had his friends been ? He knew now that a few of them , those without full-time jobs , would be hanging around the park playing bid whist or a lazy game of basketball . Swine , a second-shift man , would be washing his new car . Mote would tell them all a thing or two about friendship and loyalty . After all , friends are the ones who show up . <p> He stopped at a service station at a crossroads . Although it was a numbered county road , Edna had called it , as from some ancient time , " Princeton Pike . " At the cash register he asked for the key to the men 's room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his chin , was talking to himself as he attended to a credit-card purchase . Then : " The men 's bathroom been closed down since Monday . You buying gas ? " <p> " No , " Mote said . <p> The clerk looked up , shook his head , then pointed . " Take the women 's key there . " <p> Afterwards he bought a soda . The clerk scooped up the coins . " How far you going , guy ? " <p> " Just up the highway a little bit and I 'm done . " " Lucky you , " the man said . " I have to sit here all day and deal with farmers and fools . Nice suit there . " <p> " Thank you . " The man yawned , closed his eyes and stretched . Mote smoothly palmed a cigarette lighter from the display next to the Swisher Sweets and left . <p> The next stretch of highway looked hotter . The sun had broken through the cloud cover , and for a half mile or so there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two crows banked high overhead . The median separating the lanes was a long narrow island of knee-high weeds . He seemed to startle battalions of flies every half mile or so , as they would dive at the sides of his head or the back of his neck . <p> Three miles from the service station he stopped , lay the suit down carefully on the ground , and tied his shoes . Then he glanced at his watch . It had stopped again . Moving again , he calculated that it must have stopped about the time he had parted with Youstler . Next time he gambled , he would gamble for a watch . Big Edna had not even bothered to see him in jail . Years before when he first got into trouble , the police called her to the station . She warned him then : " I 'll come get you once , but I ai n't doing it two times . If you want to make the jail your hotel , you go right ahead . But do n't count on me as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the first rough scrapes at the Palm Grill , those tussling matches in the alley between Irwin 's barbershop and Moore 's Fix-It-Rite Garage , the police got to know him and would glance his way when they passed in their squad cars . He knew their faces , too , and recognized one when he was picked up three days ago for fighting loud Frazier about something as silly as clothes . They had broken up the party with their tussling and had been separated by the time the police showed . Darlene had gone on and on about the broken furniture and her parents away in Detroit . She told the two officers that both men were crashers , that they had slipped in uninvited while she was not looking . That part was easy . After all , Frazier was known to keep a gun in his car for bluff and stayed in trouble . But this time Frazier got six stitches to the head from hitting the corner of the table . Mote got two nights in jail . <p> Passing on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their music . During breaks in the traffic , one or two of them would step to the pavement , dance a step or two . When they drew even with him , one picked up a rock and faked a throw at him . Mote did not budge . He had counted eight of them . Young mad dogs , he thought . Out here , if the lead dog bolts for him the rest would follow , risking traffic . But their music drew them on . The boy threw the rock , which sailed far overhead . <p> He had stopped in front of a farm of scotch pines , the tallest no higher than four feet . They were planted in straight , even rows . The symmetry of their diagonals was dazzling . He climbed over a wire fence and picked out a tree in the fourth row from the road . He laid down the suit , smoothed the plastic . He found the orange Youstler had given him , peeled it with his thumbnail , and slowly ate it , standing . <p> Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within minutes , the vans would pick up the state road that would take them to US 75 and from there-who knows ? On a map he once traced the highway from northern Michigan to Orlando , Florida . Along the way were Detroit , Toledo , Dayton ( the furthest north he had been ) , Cincinnati , Lexington , Kentucky ( the furthest south he had been , to an uncle 's rambling house in the country ) , Knoxville , Atlanta , Macon , Valdosta-all faraway places he could only imagine , places he could not even conjure smells for . At night there had been the many times that he wanted-upon hearing the ii:io freight train following its tracks along the river and him loving the mournful horn sounding-he wanted to risk his life and hop one of the moving cars . He would ride it to wherever it stopped in the morning , the break of day as the only destination . <p> He started now to hum " Jimmy Mack , " one of Big Edna 's favorite songs . Actually , her favorite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragging strips of beef liver through flour or turning okra coated with cornmeal in the frying pan , all the while she sang this song . Singing loudly to herself , she would roll her shoulders . Or she would find the old 45 record and listen to it through its storm of scratches . She never explained if and how the song made any real difference in her life . Who was her Jimmy Mack ? <p> My arms are missing you , my lips feel the same way , too-oo . In the song a woman misses her lover . At the same time she is wooed mightily by another man . Mote knew nothing of Edna 's earlier personal life . He had found two photographs once of two different men . One was in a military uniform . The other leaned against the back of a convertible , arms crossed , legs crossed at the ankles . Both were smiling while frowning into the sun . <p> Less of a mystery was her caution and strict discipline . He remembered those nights in high school when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or out-of-town roller rinks . He would return half-expecting her to be singing the song from some corner of the house . More frequently than not , she would be asleep in a chair in front of the television , shadows flitting across her face and around the walls like butterflies of the night . <p> A wedding party of three cars went past-old dented cars honking , the lead car with " Just Married " soaped on its windows . The drivers looked young , barely older than the tribe walking south . What was the urgency that they could not wait until Saturday ? How much time could the groom get off from his mill shift ? Where was the honeymoon ? <p> Mote chewed a couple slivers of orange rind . He took out the stolen lighter , flipped on the flame , closed the cap . Did it again . Then he stood to move on , getting less than two hundred yards , where he found a road leading away . An iron bridge crossed a creek just fifty yards down . He figured one other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of Big Edna . Within minutes he was sitting on the edge of the bridge , his feet dangling , then kicking like a child 's from the lip of a playground swing , his suit carefully folded and lying in the road behind him . The creek rolled away beneath him , every now and then a stray paper cup pushed along by the current . He saw no fish , but there were large minnows silvering across and against the current . He could still hear the stray cars and trucks along State Route 4 . <p> From the other end of the bridge , with the magical quiet of deer , a man and a boy emerged-a grandfather and grandson , <p> Mote figured-with bamboo poles and each with a coffee can . Mote waved . " How y'all ? " Where had they come from ? <p> They waved back . He watched them pull night crawlers from their cans and bait their hooks for what seemed like an eternity . When they finally dropped their lines into the water , he lay back and closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insides of his eyelids . Yes , he would rest here a short spell . <p> Then : " I bet you 're patching up a marriage , " Mote heard . He stiffened though his eyes stayed closed . Maybe the man was playing some kind of game . <p> " Good try , but you missed by a mile if you talking to me . " " Ca n't blame a soul for trying . " The man laughed . " What y'all fishing for ? " Mote asked . <p> " We fishing for whatever bite , " the man said . " We ai n't particular . ' Course a couple big catfish and ten , twelve bluegill would n't be too bad . " <p> Mote stretched his arms out backward behind him . His body took up one lane . The man spoke again . " Mister , I do n't know who you is , but you might want to sit up over there . A car come along and take your head and arms off , both . " <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I might be too busy with a big fish to notice , " the man said . <p> Mote chuckled and opened his eyes . Out on the highway he could hear an eighteen-wheeler heading north , followed by something with a broken muffler . Then it was quiet before he heard a splash in the water . The man had just cast and was shaking his line with his free hand . The man spoke without turning . <p> " You laying there like that remind me of another man and another bridge about thirty years ago . Man come up on me while I was fishing down home . I was using dough balls that day , and he ai n't never seen that before . They the best things in the world for catching catfish , let me tell you . Anyway he say new to Alabama , that he was from up north , Illinois , Indiana , one . He did say that he was down there to register voters and start some kind of school to teach folks to read so they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asked . He claimed there was two or three of them moving around the county doing such . " <p> The man paused , said something to the boy . Then he cleared his throat and spat into the water below . <p> " That was his answer to my first question about what he was doing in Alabama . My second was did he have any kinfolks closeby . He said no . Then he haul off and say we all brothers and sisters anyway . That ' bout beat all . I mean , I expects all us colored is brothers and sisters in a way , but saying it do n't make folks believe it or act like they believe it . <p> " Then I asked him if he was carrying any protection . He said no again . Said he was unarmed . Then I told him a little about the history where he was at , but he just shake his head like he heard it all before . I told him trees got eyes and rivers got rooms . Then he just got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real nice for my time and went on his way . Things commenced to get real hot around home when a few in our part of the county tried to vote . I did hear tell about one or two thrown in jail . Next year a few more did vote , then more after that . I never did vote until I come up north . I come up to help my sister 's family when she got down with the arthritis so bad . I got a job at the mill and voted for the first time . Every time I vote or fish I think of that young man down there walking around with no protection . Do something like that strangers and you done something for true . Never did get his name . What 's your name ? " " All my friends call me Mote . " <p> " I 'm Jesse , and this here Lake . " There was a splash , and they both turned to look . <p> " I got one . " It was a man 's voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up with force , not to let it run too far for cover . The dwarf yanked his fish out of the water and swung it up to the bridge . Jesse patted the small man on the head , then unhooked the fish . <p> " Ai n't that a beauty ? " He held the fish high , its tail curling . " Oh , wait , Mister . You want a fish ? We gon ' have plenty by the time we leave today . " Mote was tempted . He could clean it and have it soaking in lemon juice by the time Edna got home . She could fry it tomorrow , hushpuppies on the side . <p> " Yes , " he finally said . Jesse wrapped it in newspaper and presented it to him as if offering a trophy . Mote thanked him , picked up his suit , and said his farewell . <p> " You got more to do than listen a old man go on and on , sho . You probably got a wife and children home waiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was joking a while ago about you and a bad marriage . Now I see the suit , you might be going to a wedding . " <p> " You getting warm , Jesse . I 'm actually headed to a reunion , my high school reunion . " <p> " I thought it was something like that , sho . Well , you be particular . " <p> Jesse was smiling , Lake 's face was a stone . He reentered the world of waking , rushing , highway afternoon traffic . The three o'clock light was flat , but glare ahead gone . A car passed in a smear of a horn blast , its wake lifting the hem of the suit coat . He tried to hold the fish , still moving , like a football , his hand gripping it under the head . He tried to imagine a tie and shirt to match the suit . Maybe he would find a silk square to let spill out of the breast pocket . A bright gold would catch the ladies ' attention . He remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties and silk squares . Such combinations announced that they knew their way around banks and airports and golf courses . These men did not fold their squares neatly to that sawtooth edge that Deacon Davis might use . Theirs looked careless , pushed into the pocket with three fingers . Mote preferred theirs . He would surprise his friends at the North Star Cafe one night . Oh yes , they would pinch it , poke it , and have their fun . But would take a step back in their minds and straighten up with admiration . <p> He smiled . He was much closer to home now , and he had won a card game and a suit , even if it had been in jail . It had just been a few hours ago that he and a man known in Butler and Union City as Late Hit were released . They arrived at the supply room at the same time . Late Hit , taller and stouter with a red bandanna tied around his head , checked through his pouch of belongings with the patience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouch . He looked at Mote , then scratched his chin as he handed it over . <p> " Sure you do n't want to play another hand ? " he asked . " I 'll throw in a bus ticket home if you beat me this time . " " I got my people out front any minute now . " <p> Late Hit had chuckled . " This suit is magic , but I got ten , twelve like it . I was just trying to save you a little trouble . Women like to touch it , rub up against it . A country boy like you might not know what to do in it . " <p> " I 'll just have to take that chance . Let me know when you ready to lose another . " Mote had changed into his wrinkled clothes in a restroom . As he came down the steps , folding the job list , he passed the intake area . He noticed a woman heavily perfumed . She wore tight peach slacks and a sleeveless white blouse . She carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit he was carrying , and hurried up the stairs , muttering something . Above Mote now floated a billboard warning drivers to buckle their seatbelts . Another pleaded for attention to the latest home mortgage rates . Nearer to town , the road kills thickened-raccoon , two possums , a small dog on its back , three stiff legs to the sky , no sign of the other . A siren or two sounded from somewhere ahead . A Greyhound bus roared past , heading in his same direction . Then he descended to the town where he had grown up . <p> He crossed an overpass . Up ahead , about a mile or so at Douglas Park , he would find Nora and Teddy , the all-day wino lovers . There would be the swimming pool with its chatter , laughter , and splashing drifting on the wind . Big Edna would have mousetraps still set , one just inside the back door , the other at the base of a food cabinet near the chipped corner of the door that never quite closed . The house might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home , imagining . Cabbage , mustard greens ? No , no . Cabbage was a Monday kind of smell . Friday was most often fried fish . But Thursday ? <p> Past the park and its roaring mythologies , past the dying corner market where cheap wine sold best in the late afternoons , donuts until midmorning , and bologna and saltines in between-past all this he gained the alley just past the newly renovated church . In one backyard a lazy terrier , Rope-a-Dope , lay on the roof of his house . But farther down a caged Doberman lunged at him . He stepped closer , wondering if the dog had caught the scent of the fish , but then moved on . <p> " Welcome home , " he said softly to the backs of the narrow houses he was now passing-pink , green , off-white-with their fences in varying degrees of disrepair . " Ai n't exactly Mr. Rogers . " At the back door , he paused , then let himself in , avoiding the mousetraps . He had a snack of milk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its skin with pliers . He cut a lemon in half and squeezed both halves over the fish . He set the platter with the fish in the refrigerator and covered it with waxed paper . In his room he hung the suit on the inside doorknob , then collapsed to his hard bed . Before dropping off to sleep , he remembered that the house smelled of fried bacon . <p> When he awoke it was almost dark , and he could see light beneath the bedroom door . The radio in the kitchen was on loud . It was a news program , and the announcer 's description of a Cincinnati expressway pile-up sounded like news about a war . Mote could hear , too , his aunt opening and closing cabinet doors . When he walked into the kitchen , she continued to move around . From the clock he figured he had slept three hours . He was still sore from the walk-his feet and hamstrings , mostly . He found a clean jelly jar and turned on the cold water at the sink . " Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dark brown woman with evenly graying , short hair . She kept moving , measuring out a cup of flour , then pouring it into a large mixing bowl . She broke two eggs against the counter and dropped the yolks and whites into the bowl . Tossed the shells underhanded to the trash bin . She turned down the radio . <p> " Hi , " he tried again . <p> This time she stopped , her back still to him . " Where is your God ? " She was standing at the short leg of an L-shaped counter , and he could look over her shoulder to a vacant lot across the alley . Surely , something there had prompted the question . " I asked you a question , Michael Otis Cox . " " My . . . God ? I do n't know what you mean . " Oh yes you do . You must know where your God is if you walk right in from the jailhouse into my kitchen and drink a glass of water like it 's the most natural thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection is . You got to know something . " <p> " Miss Edna , I 'm sorry .. " <p> " Sorry ai n't enough . Sorry did n't put you in jail . Sorry did n't make the bed you got to lay down in . " She paused . " I know about the fight , yeah , all about it . News travel in this town quicker than stink off cow shit . " <p> She stopped talking and turned back to making what he hoped and prayed were biscuits . The radio announcer was now on the baseball scores . He swallowed the last of the water and set his glass down . In another normal time he would make a ham sandwich even with dinner just an hour away . But now was not normal . " You still did n't tell me nothing about your God . " <p> " What 's God got to do with it ? " " Your God do n't know your mind ? " He shrugged . " Maybe I do n't know my own mind . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He felt dizzy and sat on a rickety stepstool . <p> " Well , you better get to know your mind quick , Mr. Man . I told you the first time the police pick you up that I ai n't having that in this house . " " I 'll be back at the mill . . " <p> " This ai n't New Year 's Eve , " she said , " and I ai n't in the mood for no empty promises . " " They ai n't empty- " <p> " Well , you gone have to show me something . " She was rolling out the dough flat , sprinkling out more flour , pausing to pull splotches of moist dough off the rolling pin . <p> " I need me some collateral . You know how you can go to the bank and ask for a loan and the man ask what you can put up against that amount in case you ca n't keep up the payments ? " He had never applied for a loan in his life . The only car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash . He leaned back on the stool as she talked about shame and responsibility and gratitude , as she cut out her biscuits and arranged them meticulously on the baking sheet . He wanted to close his eyes ever so slightly , but dared not . He wanted to stand , raise his right hand , and shout to the world , " I stand guilty as accused , " but knew it could not be that easy . He listened , heard his histories . What was there to argue with ? He had been in jail three days , with near-empty pockets walked most of the way home , and now sat in the kitchen of the only person who ever loved him . He needed her love and touch as much as her biscuits . <p> " So you tell me what you want to do for credit , then we can move on . <p> " I do n't understand , " he said . <p> " Well , you could stand in the middle of Eighteenth Avenue and tell the world you 're sorry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernice , and your daddy , Anthony , and grandfolks , all of them gone from this life . You could tell the world that , you . " Mote frowned . Slow walkers to and from Jackson 's corner grocery store-a lollipop or Coke or cheap wine in a brown bag for their troubles-all might stand and watch his confession , loud and public , as they might watch a gospel melody sung by a collie . And what of his friends when word got out about such a confession ? Could such shame be forgiven and forgotten ? <p> " . . . and do n't come thinking about going to church with your head hanging . Unless you want to stand up in front of the church and tell all . " <p> He could see himself there with the small humble group who came forward for special prayers . On his rare mornings in church he had wondered at their sins , what brought them forward ? He had watched their backs , studied the runover heels of their shoes . If he stood up there alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch all with a faint smile . The choir would sit back , eyes shrouded , a jury in their magnificent powder-blue satin robes . The minister and his assistant would sit perfectly still as he went to the start of the fight . He would tell them about protecting his honor , about the exaggerated fear of the hostess . Of jail there was little to speak ; of the suit , nothing . Members of the deacon board in their somber grays and browns would nod , and one , Deacon Williams , would urge him to tell all . <p> " Tell it to the Lord and loving witnesses , son , " he would whisper fiercely . Then repeat the command in a booming voice that would wash awake the audience , the street outside , the park where someone might be sleeping on a picnic table at that very moment . <p> Mote would keep his eyes to the rear of the church , just above the heads of the usherettes standing across the back , especially above Janine , a young high schooler bursting now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glass . " I do n't know . I ai n't never spoke in front of people before . " <p> " Talk to them like they family , " she said . <p> But they were not family , he knew . She was the only family he had known , and he could not speak long to her . Those outside were strangers who cut their grass or sat on their front porches talking and laughing and watching the world ease past . He would much rather confess before strangers he would never see againat the shopping mall fountain or a bus terminal . <p> " You see , I got to live here , even if you do n't . I want them to know that Edna did her best , always did the best she could : ' <p> " Ai n't there some other way , something else I could do ? " he asked . " What do they care ? " <p> She put the sheet into the oven and wiped her hands on a towel . " You figure out what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you saying you wo n't do it again just in this house : ' " Damn , " he whispered . <p> " What you say ? " She looked at him directly . <p> " I did n't say nothing . " He went to his room . There he lay on his back , one arm over his eyes . At least she did not ask about the fish . His radio played thin anthems of loss . Blues of the Jimmy Reed-Howling Wolf variety saddened him whenever Big Edna played them on her ancient stereo . But the up-to-date sad songs only bothered him like the difference between the last two women he had been with . Heavy-hipped Carol aroused him with just one look . He could remember whole conversations with her and on some days missed her so much he ached all over . Jackie was much prettier , drew stares when she showed up in bright , short dresses . Yet away from her he had to strain to recall her face , her voice . The old music was not pretty to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a few of them . The new blues left him blank . Strange , he thought now , how all that worked . He remembered a line from a woman 's song : <p> I 've been trying hard to be true , But Jimmy , he talks just as sweet as you Jimmy , oh Jimmy , hey , Jimmy Mack , When are you coming back ? <p> Then he thought about calling one of his friends , but did not . From outside , front , he heard voices , then a car with a thunderous bass . He rolled to his side , still sore , and drifted off . " Dinner ready . " <p> He opened his eyes to find a thin shaft of light in the room . He did not turn over . " I ai n't hungry now . I 'll eat a little something later . " <p> There was a pause , music rushing into the room , warmer than wind . She knew his affection for angel biscuits . She knew he did not have that much discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plastic bag over his suit . He still did not turn over . <p> " It 's your stomach , " she said and closed the door . He had persuaded himself that this would hurt her more than anything else . Within the hour , surely , she would beg him to eat . She might not forgive him , true . If he decided to leave , he would not be turned around this time , that much was clear . And if he stayed , to the neighbors he would blame jail on his age , on the fact that his parents , both of them , had vanished like smoke from this land . He drifted in and out of sleep for a couple hours . He thought of Jesse and Lake and the fish they probably caught . He remembered the old man carrying memories as easily as a can of live bait . <p> He was surprised when she did not beg him to eat . He was more surprised at her voice when she shouted good night from deep within the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light switch click , and after counting to five hundred , was up . Edna slept heavily . Whole storms could boil up in the night and pound the land , and she would awaken in the morning , marveling only at the peace in some bright morning . But he was up . He threw everything he could into a small suitcase from under the bed . He would return for whatever was left behind . Maybe get back one day when she was away at work . He moved through the dark kitchen , catching his hip on the corner of the countertop . He closed the back door quietly . No mousetrap sounded . <p> Outside it was warm and still . One or two dogs started up . One or two cars sped past the end of the alley . He walked with no idea of where he was going and who would take him in . He would go to the park and think about it . <p> At the mouth of the alley , a car stopped . He could hear a blast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , True at the wheel . He could smell the rum . He did not lower his bag or look at them at first . <p> " Mote , is that you , man ? Where you going with that bag this time of night ? " Pepper wore dark glasses even at night . He went on . " So jail can be rough , ca n't it ? Look , do n't worry about Frazier . We 'll back you if he start anything . " True leaned from the steering wheel . " Hey , hey , yeah , Mote , tell us that joke , you know the one about the badfoot nigger from Alabama . . " <p> " Fuck y'all , ' Mote said . " Fuck all , y'all : ' They roared off with laughs to awake the night . He walked home through a chorus of barking dogs . <p> Back in his room he slept for only an hour , it seemed . Mote stood up and paced around his room , his bag still packed . Then he ate his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl in the sink when he heard the creaking . <p> " Morning , " he said , not turning . <p> " Morning . " She turned on the radio and found a station that played country music . <p> He smiled . There was no figuring his aunt . " No Jimmy Mack ' ? " he asked . <p> " Maybe by noon . " <p> " I been all the time meaning to ask you how come you like that song so much . " He was fishing out a cold biscuit and looking for a jar of honey . <p> " It reminds me of my dancing days , is all . " She paused . " I just loved to go dancing , especially at the park dances outdoors at night . All that was gone by the time you grew up . " <p> " You never know somebody in real life like the guy in the song ? " <p> She laughed . " I knew a few men like him , but I would n't call them back . " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll tell you something : ' <p> She took her time . She poured more sugar into her coffee , tasted it , poured a bit more . " You know that ai n't good for you , " Mote said . <p> " You my doctor ? " She took a long sip , then turned down a radio ballad about too much whiskey and too little love . He cleared his throat . " You ever hear the saying The trees got ears and the river got rooms ' ? " <p> She shrugged . " Never have . Sounds like to me somebody saying be careful . Where you hear something country like that ? " " Some old man . " <p> " Was that all you wanted to tell me ? " <p> " Well , what if I went to just some of neighbors , you know , and kind of explained about the circumstances ? Would that satisfy you ? I mean , they could pass it on to the others . " <p> She took another sip , frowning against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street on this block from end to end'course you can skip the Tatums . They might shoot at you the way they shot at the Wilhite boy last Halloween . Do that and I 'll be happy . <p> He sighed and closed his eyes . " Okay , okay . " <p> She was in front of him . She clicked her cup against the empty bowl he was drying off , toasted him the way she did when he announced his first after-school job , when he announced his breakup from Mary Alice , whose mother she never liked , when he announced seven years ago that he might join the church . She was smiling . " They got me working this morning . It 's Friday so it 's some extra pay . I be back home from work around fivethirty . I want you to start with the neighbors while I 'm gone . You know all their schedules . Then tonight me and you start back on the story about your suit . . " <p> " Oh , there really ai n't nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't have time now . I got to get to work " " Okay , " he said . <p> " You go ahead and start the fish , too . Use that beer batter I showed you that time and go heavy on the garlic salt . I 'll fix up a little something on the side when I get back . You sure picked yourself out a nice-sized fish . " <p> She was nearly out of the door when she turned . " Maybe this evening when you all through , I 'll tell you something about my Jimmy Mack . ' The screen door slammed , and he watched her go down the front steps . She stopped , turned to make sure her slip was not hanging , then moved on . He shook his head , was all he could do . <p>
