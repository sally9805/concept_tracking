// It 's late October in Virginia 's Blue Ridge . The only thing darker than the approaching cloud bank is the scowl on Jim Law 's face . Twenty acres of wine grapes , nearly perfect for picking , await the imminent harvest . Heavy rain now could dilute their sugar , cause them to swell , and eventually burst . " There is nothing more frightening than standing in your vineyard and watching it explode , " says Peggy , Jim 's wife and partner . But luck is on their side . Storm clouds steamroll over the russet mountaintops , barely bending the goldenrod with halfhearted raindrops . This is Linden Vineyards , Jim and Peggy 's home , the scenic and sometimes frantic source of some of the tastiest wines in the South . It 's also a popular weekend destination for city dwellers and suburbanites in search of historic apple varieties and juicy , U-pick blueberries . The vineyard 's story begins not in the pastoral hills of Virginia , but in the rain forests of central Africa . After studying economics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , joined the Peace Corps , and journeyed to Zaire , where he worked to develop better ways of growing bananas , papayas , mangoes , coffee , and cacao . While there , he took his first crack at making wine . But not from grapes-from palm trees . " The native people tap the sweet sap of palms , which in the morning tastes a little like Mountain Dew , " he explains wistfully . " Then the wild yeasts go to work . By afternoon , it 's a fizzy wine cooler . By evening , it 's dry wine . " Quaffing palm wine inspired Jim to make the real stuff . Upon returning to the States , he joined a nowdefunct winery in Virginia , where he met Peggy . She had worked at the National Zoological Park 's Conservation and Research Center . But an inner voice turned her to winemaking too . After the pair 's joint apprenticeship , they struck out on their own . In 1983 , they bought 76 acres of wooded hillside south of Linden , Virginia . Clearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vines in 1985 and sold their first bottle in 1988 . Production now runs at 5,000 cases a year . Photograph ( Top ) After Jim and Peggy bought the land , they found a log house in West Virginia and moved it here . " We both felt a great sense of being rooted to the ground , " explains Peggy . " We wanted our house to feel that way too .

The place truly belongs in a Thomas Cole painting . But more important than aesthetics was the farm 's ability to grow outstanding grapes . This it has . The ancient volcanic soil of the Blue Ridge supplies good drainage and rich minerals . Moreover , the 1,350-foot elevation protects the plants from early spring frosts . It also delays ripening well into fall , intensifying the flavors . " One thing we 've learned is that wine tastes best when grapes ripen over a long period of time , " says Jim . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Grapes need to ripen when the nights are cool and the days warm and sunny . " Peggy adds , " Coolness helps the fruit retain acidity . Without acidity , you end up with something very bland . We call ' em ' wimpy grapes . ' " The Laws create wines from mainstream European grapes ( Cabernet Sauvignon , Chardonnay , Riesling ) , lesser known European grapes ( Cabernet Franc , Petit Verdot ) , and French-American hybrids ( Seyval , Vidal ) . Critics agree there is n't a wimpy wine among them . Wine Spectator , Food &; Wine , and Bon Appetit have praised Linden 's wines . In blind tastings against California winemakers , Linden has polished off such well-known labels as William Hill , Joseph Phelps , Clos du Bois , and Robert Mondavi . The honors continued this year when President Clinton served Linden 's 1993 Chardonnay at the White House . Photograph Linden sold its first bottle of wine in 1988 and now produces 5,000 cases a year . // Jim and Peggy consider themselves intuitive winemakers , relying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each wine like it was their child , then trust gut instinct when making such weighty decisions as how to blend and when to pick . They do n't always agree . " We 're both pretty stubborn , " admits Peggy , " but we also respect each other 's opinion . I think that 's a strength , that there are two of us . It makes for good winemaking , although sometimes it makes for a testy marriage . " One point they always agree on is that good wine necessitates good food . " Having a wine with just the right food makes both taste even better , " observes Peggy . Thus , Linden 's labels always suggest the type of cuisine best suited to particular wines . Linden also sponsors gourmet wine dinners created by Four and Twenty Blackbirds , an innovative restaurant in nearby Flint Hill , Virginia . Had you supped at the winery this summer , you 'd have enjoyed blue crab cakes with yellow pepper salsa served with 1995 Seyval , as well as marinated sea scallops with Linden blueberries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an award-winning vineyard reflects a deep commitment to preserving both the land and Virginia 's agrarian heritage . " We 're very much aware that agriculture is slowly dying out where we are , as more and more housing developments go in , " says Peggy . That 's one reason they started an antique apple orchard , stocked with such historic , hard-to-find varieties as Esopus Spitzenburg , Black Twig , and Ashmead 's Kernal . Visitors book weekends at nearby bed-and-breakfasts just to be on hand when their favorite kind ripens . Finding the one they remember from childhood brings some visitors close to tears . Now it 's November . Another successful harvest rests in the crusher . Buckets of red juice , blood of the vine , splash into the press . Family and friends lend hands to the work ; the moment 's emotion is laughter . A smile expands Jim Law 's face , recalling the words of food writer M. F. K. Fisher : " . . . with good friends . . . and good food on the board , and good wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall we live if not now ? " Photograph ( Top ) Chardonnay grapes benefit from Linden 's long , sunny summers and cool nights . ( Above ) After red grapes ferment on the skins , Jim and Peggy bucket them into a press . This traditional , old-world method protects the flavor . Photograph ( Above ) " When I first started reading about old apples , it sparked something in me , " says Peggy . Today , visitors flock to Linden to pick old-time varieties such as the ones shown here . From left to right atop the pots , Esopus Spitzenburg , Newtown Pippin , Black Amish , Ashmead 's Kernal , and Black Twig . The identity of the red apple on the far left remains a mystery .
