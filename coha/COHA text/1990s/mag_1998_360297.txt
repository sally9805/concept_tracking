1 MARK MCGWIRE Starting right with spring training , all of baseball was focused on one man . The riddle that every fan pondered ( and every reporter posed to McGwire ) : If Babe Ruth hit 60 homers in 1927 , and Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961 , could McGwire hit 62 in 1998 ? McGwire mocked the question , hitting an incredible 70 over the fence . And they were 70 big ones : four went more than 500 ft . The St. Louis Cardinals ' batting practice became a show in itself with crowded outfield seats ; his practice shots got bigger cheers than real ones at most stadiums . But more than hitting a ball really far , McGwire showed what a true sports hero he is by the way he handled the attention with class and with respect for his worthy rival , Sammy Sosa . <P> 2 SAMMY SOSA What if you trekked to the North Pole all by yourself , only to find Admiral Peary got there five days before ? The great part is that Sosa 's 66 homers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gracious style , and major league baseball gave him the National League MVP  --  over McGwire . <P> 3 MICHAEL JORDAN As if in some far-fetched action film , Michael Jordan once again snagged victory at the last second . His sixth championship of the decade came over a favored Utah Jazz team . Who was putting his Vegas money against MJ ? Smarter to bet he 'd score 45 points to win Game 6 and another ring . <P> 4 THE YANKEES Thanks to strong journeymen like World Series MVP Scott Brosius and a whole lot of teamwork , the Yanks put together the best season ever  --  without a megastar . They won 114 regular-season games before racing through three levels of playoffs . They also landed a perfect game , a batting title and fans outside New York . <P> 5 CAL RIPKEN JR . Ripken ended his record 2,632-consecutive-game streak quietly , sitting out a game unannounced at the end of the season , when SportsCenter was tuned to McGwire , Sosa and the Yanks . Ripken was healthy , but knew it was time to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Streak , the Dow Jones was 819.54 . Worry . <P> 6 THE BRONCOS Remember when you thought an AFC team would never win the Super Bowl again ? Well , John Elway and his Broncos won an upset Super Bowl XXXII , and then used that momentum to try for a perfect 1998 season . And for the first time in recent memory , they made football cool . Anyone who saw Elway 's 14-yd. catch is a fan . <P> 7 CZECH HOCKEY Canada and the U.S. shoved in as many NHL players as could fit on a team and packed them off to Nagano ; each squad came home with zero Olympic medals . The Czechs , led by NHL goaltender Dominik Hasek , beat them both . Then they crushed the formerly occupying Russians in an emotional championship game . The all-night celebration in Prague made U.S. ticker-tape parades look silly . <P> 8 JEFF GORDON Just 27 , Gordon has won three of the last four NASCAR championships . His 13 wins this year tie Richard Petty 's 1975 record . His domination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already lost him fans . But his guts , skill and pit crew will be breaking records for the next few decades , so get used to him . <P> 9 IRAN 'S WORLD CUP TEAM The upset of Brazil by France 's ethnically diverse home team may have been the defining moment of the World Cup , but for pure excitement it was scrappy Iran trouncing the cocky U.S. team . Any game that , by the second half , persuaded some Americans to root for Iran has to be good .
