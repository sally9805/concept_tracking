" William Coombs , with two " O 's , " Melanie Ballinger told her father over long distance . " Pronounced just like the thing you comb your hair with . Say it . " Ballinger repeated the name . " Say the whole name . " " I 've got it , sweetheart . Why am I saying it ? " " Dad , I 'm bringing him home with me . We 're getting married . " For a moment , he could n't speak . " Dad ? Did you hear me ? " " I 'm here , " he said . " Well ? " Again he could n't say anything . " Dad ? " " Yes , " he said . " That 's  --  that 's some news . " " That 's all you can say ? " " Well , I mean  --  Melanie  --  this is sort of quick , is n't it ? " he said . " Not that quick . How long did you and Mom wait ? " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You waited six months , and you do too remember . And this is five months . And we 're not measuring each other by anything . William and I have known each other longer than five months , but we 've been together  --  you know , as a couple  --  five months . And I 'm almost twenty-three , which is two years older than Mom was . And do n't tell me it was different when you guys did it . " " No , " he heard himself say . " It 's pretty much the same , I imagine . " " Well ? " she said . " Well , " Ballinger said . " I 'm  --  I 'm very happy for you . " " You do n't sound happy . " " I 'm happy . I ca n't wait to meet him . " " Really ? Promise ? You 're not just saying that ? " " It 's good news , darling . I mean , I 'm surprised , of course . It 'll take a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everything . I mean , your mother and I did n't even know you were seeing anyone . But no , I 'm  --  I 'm glad . I ca n't wait to meet the young man . " " Well , and now there 's something else you have to know . " " I 'm ready , " John Ballinger said . He was standing in the kitchen of the house she had n't seen yet , and outside the window his wife , Mary , was weeding in the garden , wearing a red scarf and a white muslin blouse and jeans , looking young and even happy , though for a long while now there had been between them very little happiness . " Well , this one 's kind of hard , " his daughter said over the thousand miles of wire . " Maybe we should talk about it later . " " No . I 'm sure I can take whatever it is , " he said . The truth was that he had news of his own to tell . Almost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separation . Some time for them both to sort things out . They had decided not to say anything about it to Melanie until she arrived . But now Melanie had said that she was bringing someone with her . She was hemming and hawing on the other end of the line : " I do n't know ... See , Daddy , I  --  God . I mean , I ca n't find the way to say it really . " He waited . She was in Chicago , where they had sent her to school more than four years ago , and where after her graduation she had stayed , having landed a job with an independent newspaper in the city . In March , Ballinger and Mary had moved to this small house in the middle of Charlottesville , Virginia , hoping that a change of scene might help things . It had n't ; they were falling apart after all these years . " Dad , " Melanie said , sounding helpless . " Honey , I 'm listening . " " Okay , look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't react ? " " How can I promise a thing like that , Melanie ? " " You 're going to react , then . I wish you could just promise me you would n't . " " Darling , " he said . " I 've got something to tell you , too . Promise me you wo n't react . " She said promise in that way the young have of being absolutely certain what their feelings will be in some future circumstance . " So , " he said . " Now , tell me whatever it is . " And a thought struck him like a shock . " Melanie , you 're not  --  you 're not pregnant , are you ? " She said , " How did you know ? " He felt something sharp move under his heart . " Oh , Lord  --  seriously ? " " Jeez , " she said . " Wow . That 's really amazing . " " You 're  --  pregnant . " " Right . My God . You 're positively clairvoyant , Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of any clairvoyance , Melanie , from the way you were talking . Are you  --  is it sure ? " " Of course , it 's sure . But  --  I mean , that is n't the really hard thing . Maybe I should just wait . " " Wait , " he said . " Wait for what ? " " Until you get used to everything else . " He said nothing . She was fretting on the other end of the line , sighing and starting to speak and then stopping herself . " I do n't know , " she said finally , and now he thought she was talking to someone in the room with her . " Honey , do you want me to put your mother on ? " " No , Daddy . I wanted to talk to you about this first . I mean , I think we should get this over with . " " Get this over with ? Melanie , what 're we talking about here ? I mean , maybe I should put your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After all , " he added , " I 've never been pregnant . " " It 's not about being pregnant . You guessed that . " He held the phone tight against this ear . Through the window he saw his wife stand up from the flowers and stretch , massaging the small of her back with one gloved hand . Oh , Mary . " Are you ready ? " his daughter said . " Wait , " he said . " Wait a minute . Should I be sitting down ? I 'm sitting down . " He pulled a chair from the table and settled into it . He could hear her breathing on the other end of the line , or perhaps now it was the static wind he so often heard when talking on these new phones . " Okay , " he said , feeling his throat begin to close . " Tell me . " " William 's somewhat older than I am , " she said . Now she sounded as though she might hyperventilate . " There . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Well , it 's how much . " " Okay . " She seemed to be trying to collect herself . She breathed , paused . " This is even tougher than I thought it was going to be . " " You mean you 're going to tell me something harder than the fact that you 're pregnant ? " She was silent . " Melanie ? " " I did n't expect you to be this way about it , " she said . " Honey , please just tell me the rest of it . " " Well , what did you mean by that , anyway ? " " Melanie , you said this would be hard . " Silence . " Tell me , sweetie . Please ? " " I 'm going to . " She took a breath . " Dad , William 's sixty  --  he 's  --  he 's sixty  --  sixty-three years old . " Ballinger stood . Out in the garden his wife had got down to her knees again , pulling crabgrass out of the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all along the shady street , people were working in their little orderly spaces of grass and flowers . " Did you hear me , Daddy ? It 's perfectly all right , too , because he 's really a young sixty-three , and very strong and healthy , and look at George Burns . " " George Burns , " Ballinger repeated . " George Burns ? Melanie , I do n't understand . " " Come on , Daddy , stop it . " " What are you telling me ? " he said . His mind was blank . " I said William is sixty-three . " " William who ? " " Dad . My fiance . " " Wait , Melanie . You 're saying your fiance  --  the man you 're going to marry  --  he 's sixty-three ? " " A young sixty-three , " she said . " Melanie . Sixty-three ? " " Dad . " " You did n't say six feet three ? " She was silent . " Melanie ? " " Yes . " " Honey , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke on me . " " It is not a  --  it 's not that . God , " she said . " I do n't believe this . " " You do n't believe  --  " he began . " You do n't believe  --  " " Dad , " she said . " I told you  --  " Again she seemed to be talking to someone else in the room with her . Her voice trailed off . " Melanie , " he said . " Talk into the phone . " " I know it 's hard , " she told him . " I know it 's asking you to take a lot in . " " Well , no , " Ballinger said , feeling something shift inside , a quickening in his blood . " It 's  --  it 's a little more than that , Melanie , is n't it ? I mean , it 's not a weather report , for God 's sake . " " I should 've known , " she said . " Forgive me for it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something ... " " It 's all right , Daddy , " she began , as if reciting it for him . " I really know what I 'm doing . I 'm not really rushing into anything  --  " He interrupted her . " Well , good God , somebody rushed into something , right ? " " Daddy ! " " Is that what you call him ? No , I 'm Daddy  --  you have to call him Grand-daddy . " " That is not funny , " she said . " I was n't being funny , Melanie , and anyway that was n't my question . " He took a breath . " Please forgive this , but I have to know . " " There 's nothing you really have to know , Daddy . I 'm an adult . I 'm telling you out of family courtesy . " " I understand that . Family courtesy exactly . Exactly , Melanie , that 's a good phrase . Would you please tell me , out of family courtesy , if the baby is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , coming from a long way off . " I am sorry for the question . I just have to put all this together . I mean , you 're asking me to take in a whole lot here , you know ? " " I said I understood how you feel . " " I do n't think so . I do n't think you quite understand how I feel . " " All right , " she said . " I do n't understand how you feel . But I think I knew how you 'd react . " For a few seconds there was just the low sea-sound of long distance . " Melanie , have you done any of the math on this ? " " I should 've bet money , " she said in the tone of a person who has been proven right about something . " Well , but Jesus , " Ballinger said . " I mean , he 's older than I am , kid . He 's  --  he 's a lot older than I am . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke . " Honey , nineteen years . When he was my age I was only two years older than you are now . " " I do n't see what that has to do with anything , " she said . " Melanie , I 'll be forty-five in December . I 'm a young forty-four . " " I know when your birthday is , Dad . " " Well , good God  --  this guy 's nineteen years older than your own father . " She said , " I 've grasped the numbers . Maybe you should go ahead and put Mom on . " " Melanie , you could n't pick somebody a little closer to my age ? Some snot-nosed forty-year-old ? " " Stop it , " she said . " Please , Daddy . I know what I 'm doing . " " Do you know how old he 's going to be when your baby is ten ? Do you ? Have you given that any thought at all ? " She was silent . He said , " How many children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not thinking about that . Any of that . This is now , and I do n't care about anything else . " He sat down in his kitchen and tried to think of something else to say . Outside the window his wife , with no notion of what she was about to be hit with , looked through the patterns of shade in the blinds and , seeing him , waved . It was friendly , but even so , all their difficulty was in it . Ballinger waved back . " Melanie , " he said , " do you mind telling me just where you happened to meet William ? I mean , how do you meet a person forty years older than you are ? Was there a senior citizen-student mixer at the college ? " " Stop it , Daddy . " " No , I really want to know . If I 'd just picked this up and read it in the newspaper I think I 'd want to know . I 'd probably call the newspaper and see what I could find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just tell me how you met . You can do that , ca n't you ? " " Jesus Christ , " she said , then paused . Ballinger waited . " He 's a teacher , like you and Mom , only college . He was my literature teacher . He 's a professor of literature . He knows everything that was ever written , and he 's the most brilliant man I 've ever known . You have no idea how fascinating it is just to talk with him . " " Yes , and I guess you understand that over the years that 's what you 're going to be doing a lot of with him , Melanie . A lot of talking . " " I am carrying the proof that disproves you , " she said . He could n't resist saying , " Did he teach you to talk like that ? " " I 'm gon na hang up . " " You promised you 'd listen to something I had to tell you . " " Okay , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine her tapping the toe of one foot on the floor : the impatience of someone awaiting an explanation . He thought a moment . " He 's a professor ? " " That 's not what you wanted to tell me . " " But you said he 's a professor . " " Yes , I said that . " " Do n't be mad at me , Melanie . Give me a few minutes to get used to the idea . Jesus . Is he a professor emeritus ? " " If that means distinguished , yes . But I know what you 're  --  " " No , Melanie . It means retired . You went to college . " She said nothing . " I 'm sorry but , for God 's sake , it 's a legitimate question . " " It 's a stupid , mean-spirited thing to ask . " He could tell from her voice that she was fighting back tears . " Is he there with you now ? " " Yes , " she said , sniffling . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you being this way ? " " Do you think maybe we could 've had this talk alone ? What 's he , listening on the other line ? " " No . " " Well , thank God for that . " " I 'm going to hang up now . " " No , now please do n't hang up . Please let 's just be calm and talk about this . We have some things to talk about here . " She sniffled , blew her nose . Someone held the phone for her . There was a muffled something in the line , and then she was there again . " Go ahead , " she said . " Is he still there in the room with you ? " " Yes . " Her voice was defiant . " Where ? " " Oh , for God 's sake , " she said . " I 'm sorry , I feel the need to know . Is he sitting down ? " " I want him here , Daddy . We both want to be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry you . " " Yes , " she said impatiently . " Do you think I could talk to him ? " She said something he could n't hear , and then there were several seconds of some sort of discussion , in whispers . Finally she said , " Do you promise not to yell at him ? " " Melanie , he wants me to promise not to yell at him ? " " Will you promise ? " " Good God , who is this guy ? " " Promise , " she said . " Or I 'll hang up right now . " " All right . I promise . I promise not to yell at him . " There was another small scuffing sound , and a man 's voice came through the line . " Hello , sir . " It was  --  as far as Ballinger could tell  --  an ordinary voice , slightly lower than baritone . He thought of cigarettes . " I realize this is a difficult  --  " " Do you smoke ? " Ballinger interrupted him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go on . " " Well , I want you to know I understand how you feel  --  " " Melanie says she does , too , " Ballinger said . " I mean , I 'm certain you both think you do . " " It was my idea that Melanie call you about this . " " Oh , really . That speaks well of you . You probably knew I 'd find this a little difficult to absorb and that 's why you waited until Melanie was pregnant , for Christ 's sake . " The other man gave forth a small sigh of exasperation . " So you 're a professor of literature . " " Yes , sir . " " Oh , you need n't " sir " me . After all , I mean I am the goddamn kid here . " " There 's no need for sarcasm now , sir . " " Oh , I was n't being sarcastic . That was a literal statement of this situation that obtains right here as we 're speaking . And , really , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir . " " Coombs like the thing you comb your hair with . " The other man was quiet . " Just how long do you think it 'll take me to get used to this ? You think you might get into your seventies before I get used to this ? And how long do you think it 'll take my wife , who 's twenty-one years younger than you are , to get used to this ? " Silence . " You 're too old for my wife , for Christ 's sake . " Nothing . " What 's your first name again ? " The other man spoke through another sigh . " Perhaps we should just ring off . " " Ring off . Jesus . Ring off ? Did you actually say " Ring off ' ' ? What 're you , a goddamn limey or something ? " " I am an American . I fought in Korea . " " Not World War II ? " The other man did not answer . " How many other marriages have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a valid question . I 'm glad you  --  " " Thank you for the scholarly observation , sir . But I 'm not sitting in a class now . How many did you say ? " " If you 'd give me a chance , I 'd tell you . " Ballinger said nothing . " Two , sir . I 've had two marriages . " " Divorces ? " " I have been widowed twice . " " And now  --  oh , I get it . Now you 're trying to make sure that never happens to you again . " " This is not going well at all , and I 'm afraid I  --  I  --  " The other man stammered , then stopped . " How did you expect it to go ? " Ballinger demanded . " Cruelty is not what I 'd expected . I 'll tell you that . " " You thought I 'd be glad my daughter is going to be collecting social security before I do . " The other was silent . " Do you have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I happen to have three . " There was a stiffness , an overweening tone , in the voice now . " And how old are they , if I might ask ? " " Yes , you may . " Ballinger waited . His wife walked in from outside , carrying some cuttings . She poured water in a glass vase and stood at the counter , arranging the flowers , her back to him . The other man had stopped talking . " I 'm sorry , " Ballinger said . " My wife just walked in here and I did n't catch any of what you said . Could you just tell me if any of them are anywhere near my daughter 's age ? " " I told you my youngest boy is thirty-eight . " " And you realize that if he wanted to marry my daughter I 'd be upset  --  the age difference there being what it is . " Ballinger 's wife now moved to his side , drying her hands on a paper towel , her face full of puzzlement and worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understood how you feel . The point is we have a pregnant woman here and we both love her . " " No , " Ballinger said . " That 's not the point . The point is that you , sir , are not much more than a goddamn statutory rapist . That 's the point . " His wife took his shoulder . He looked at her and shook his head . " What ? " she whispered . " Is Melanie all right ? " " Well , this is n't accomplishing anything  --  " the voice on the other end of the line was saying . " Just a minute , " Ballinger said . " Let me ask you something else . Really now , what 's the policy at that goddamn university concerning teachers screwing their students ? " " Oh , my God ! " his wife said , as the voice on the line huffed and seemed to gargle . " I 'm serious , " Ballinger said . " Melanie was not my student when we became involved . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? " " Let me talk to Melanie , " Ballinger 's wife said . " Listen , " he told her . " Be quiet . " And now Melanie was on the line . " Daddy ? Daddy ? " " I 'm here , " Ballinger said , holding the phone from his wife 's attempt to take it from him . " Daddy , we 're getting married and there 's nothing you can do about it . Do you understand ? " " Melanie , " he said , and it seemed that somewhere far inside himself he heard that he had begun shouting at her . " Jee-zus good Christ . Your fiance was almost my age now the day you were born . What the hell , kid ? Are you crazy ? Are you out of your mind ? " Now his wife was actually pushing against him to take the phone , and so he gave it to her . And stood there while she tried to talk . " Melanie , " she said . " Honey , listen  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ . Hang it up . " " Please . Will you go in the other room and let me talk to her ? " " Tell her I 've got friends . All these nice men in their forties . She can marry any one of my friends  --  they 're babies . Forties  --  cradle fodder . Jesus , any one of them . Tell her . " " Jack , stop it . " Then she put the phone against her chest . " Did you tell her anything about us ? " He paused . " That  --  no . " She turned from him . " Melanie , honey . What is this ? Tell me , please  --  " He left her there , walked through the living room to the hall and back around to the kitchen . He was all nervous energy now , crazy with it , pacing . Mary stood very still , listening , nodding slightly , holding the phone tight , with both hands , her shoulders hunched as if she were out in cold weather . " Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bedroom and closed the door . The light coming from the windows was soft gold , and the room was deepening with shadows . He moved to the bed and sat down , and in a moment he noticed that he had begun a low sort of murmuring . He took a breath and tried to be still . From the other room his wife 's voice came to him . " Yes , I quite agree with you . But I 'm just unable to put this  --  " The voice trailed off . He waited . A few minutes later she came to the door and knocked lightly , then looked in . " What ? " he said . " They 're serious . " She stood there in the doorway . " Come here , " he said . She took a step to the bed and eased herself down , and he moved slightly to accommodate her . He put his arm around her , and then , because it was awkward , clearly an embarrassment to her , took it away . Neither of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been through during the course of deciding about each other seemed concentrated now . Ballinger breathed his wife 's presence , the odor of earth and flowers , the outdoors . " God , " she said now , " I 'm numb . I do n't know what to think . " " Let 's have another baby , " he said suddenly . " Melanie 's baby will need a younger aunt or uncle . " Mary was silent . " Did you tell her about us ? " he asked . " No . " She sighed . " I did n't get the chance . And I do n't know that I could have . " " I do n't suppose it 's going to matter much to her . " " Oh , do n't say that . You ca n't mean that . " The telephone on the bedstand rang and startled them both . He reached for it , held the handset toward her . " Hello , " she said . Then , " Oh . Hi . Yes , well , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , " he said . Melanie 's voice , tearful and angry : " You had something you said you had to tell me . " She sobbed , then coughed . " Well ? " " It was nothing , honey . I do n't even remember what it was . " " Well , I want you to know I would 've been better than you were , Daddy , no matter how hard it was . I would 've kept myself from reacting . " " Yes , " he said . " I 'm sure you would have . " " I 'm going to hang up now . And I guess I 'll let you know later if we 're coming at all . If it was n't for Mom we would n't be . " " We 'll talk , " he told her . " We 'll work on it . Honey , you 've both just got to give us a little time . " " There 's nothing to work on as far as William and I are concerned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every marriage  --  " His voice had caught . He took a breath . " In every marriage there are things to work on . " " I know what I know , " she said . " Well , " said Ballinger . " That 's  --  that 's as it should be at your age , darling . " " Good-bye , " she said . " I ca n't say any more right now . " " I understand . " When the line clicked , Ballinger held the handset in his lap for a moment . Mary was sitting there at his side , perfectly still . " Well , " he said . " I could n't tell her . " He put the handset back in its cradle . Then he said , " God . A sixty-three-year-old son-in-law . " " It 's happened before . " She put her hand on his shoulder , then took it away . " I 'm so frightened for her . But she says it 's what she wants . " " Hell , Mary . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was her goddamn teacher . " " Listen to you  --  what are you saying about her ? Listen to what you 're saying about her . That 's our daughter you 're talking about . You might at least try to give her the credit of assuming that she 's aware of what she 's doing . " They sat there for a few moments . " Who knows , " Ballinger 's wife said . " Maybe they 'll be happy for a time . " He 'd heard the note of sorrow in her voice and thought he knew what she was thinking , then he was certain that he knew . He sat there remembering , like Mary , their early happiness , that ease and simplicity  --  and briefly he was in another house , other rooms , and he saw the toddler that Melanie had been , trailing through slanting light in a brown hallway , draped in gowns she had fashioned from her mother 's clothes .

He looked at his wife , but she had averted her gaze , her hands running absently over the faded denim cloth of her lap . Finally she stood . " Well , " she sighed , going away . " Work to do . " " Mary ? " he said in a low voice , but she had n't heard him . She was already out of the doorway and into the hall , moving toward the kitchen . He reached over and turned on the lamp by the bed , and then lay down . It was so quiet here now . Dark was coming to the windows . On the wall there were pictures ; shadows , shapes silently clamoring for his gaze . He shut his eyes , listened to the small sounds she made in the kitchen , arranging her flowers , running the tap . Mary , he had said . But he could not imagine what he might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Richard Bausch 's new novel , Rebel Powers , has just been published by Houghton Mifflin . <p>
