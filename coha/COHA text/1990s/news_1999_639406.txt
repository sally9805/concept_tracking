<p> The tears told coach John McGroaty that Olandis Gary was special . <p> Gary was 13 at the time , playing tailback for McGroaty 's Boys Club football team just outside of Washington D.C. <p> ' I remember it so well , ' McGroaty recalled . ' We were playing for the Boys Club championship . It was like a youth metro Super Bowl against the best teams from the area . We won 8-6 , but it was the first time anybody scored on us all season . <p> ' But what I remember most was Olandis . He had tears running down his cheeks . I 'm not talking about after we won . I 'm talking about during the game . He was so competitive , and he wanted to win so bad , that he was crying during the game . I 'll never forget that . ' <p> That inner fire is hard to detect when you talk to Gary . With his baby face and yes-sir , no-sir demeanor , Gary , a devout Christian , seems as gentle as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask Woodson <p> Once he 's on it , the Broncos ' 5-foot-11 , 218-pound rookie running back is a beast . Just ask Oakland cornerback Charles Woodson , who got knocked on his butt when he tried to take on Gary one-on-one two weeks ago . Just ask the Green Bay Packers , who went home licking their wounds , icing their bruises and wondering just who in the heck Gary was after he ran the ball 37 times for 124 yards and his first NFL touchdown last Sunday . <p> ' We call him ' Baby Riggins " Broncos veteran running back Derek Loville said , referring to bruising Hall of Fame running back John Riggins , who starred for the Washington Redskins . ' Olandis is so tough . He can run people over . He does n't always make the right reads yet , but he 's going to get his yards . He 's going to put a hurt on people . ' <p> Riggins , at 240 pounds , earned a reputation for leaving cleat marks on defenders ' chests . He wore No. 44 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 's ( No. 22 ) instead of double 4 's . Hence the nickname ' Baby Riggins . ' <p> Gary starts his third game of the season today when the Broncos visit the New England Patriots . It 's not where he thought he would be . Back during the dog days of summer training camp , Gary , Denver 's fourth-round draft choice out of Georgia , was worried about even making the team . Landing a spot of the practice squad seemed a decent dream at the time . <p> Rushed into battle <p> After all , the Broncos had 1998 NFL MVP Terrell Davis as their starting back . Behind Davis stood Loville , a proven nine-year veteran . But when Davis blew out his knee , and Loville pulled his hamstring , Gary was rushed to the front lines and with Gary in the backfield , the Broncos have won two straight . <p> ' Am I proud of my man ? Of course I am . I 'm his mentor , ' said Davis , a fellow Georgia Bulldog . <p> ' Anytime a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means a lot , ' Gary said . ' He knows I 'm willing . I have a lot left to learn and Terrell can teach me . ' <p> Gary 's improbable rise to become an NFL starter is just part of his improbable success story . <p> Mary Poole , Gary 's mother , raised Olandis and his four siblings by herself in Camp Springs , Md . Gary 's parents separated when he was just a toddler . It was Poole , a pastor in Camp Springs , who kept Gary 's daily life grounded , but taught his spirit to soar . <p> ' My mom is the one who built my character , ' Gary said . ' She taught me to put God first and to be a God-fearing person . She was the one who gave me a work ethic . She was a single-parent mom and had to work and raise five kids at the same time . ' <p> It was McGroaty who turned Gary into a football player . <p> ' He taught me the little things and the fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McGroaty and Gary won their Boys Club championship , they did n't see each other for nearly two years . Gary went to public high school Fairmont Heights in Riverdale , Md . But he struggled with his grades as a freshman and seemed to be foundering . <p> Early struggles <p> Meanwhile , McGroaty had become the head football coach at Riverdale Baptist . <p> ' It was a private , tiny little school , ' McGroaty said . ' I think we had maybe 125 boys in the entire school . ' <p> The summer before his sophomore year , Gary heard that McGroaty was at Riverdale . He convinced his mom to let him attend , and soon he and McGroaty were back together . <p> ' It was a pretty bad program before we got there , ' McGroaty recalled . ' They were winless the year before and had scored only three touchdowns the whole year . ' <p> On the first day of practice , McGroaty had 14 kids out for the team . By the time Gary graduated in 1994 , there were 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games . Gary departed Riverdale with 5,375 career rushing yards in just three seasons . He remains Maryland 's all-time leading high school rusher . Gary wanted to go to the University of Maryland , but his SAT scores scared off the Terrapins . On his third try , Gary registered a qualifying SAT score , but by then Maryland had given away his scholarship . <p> Moved to Marshall <p> He ended up at Marshall , then a Division I-AA school . Under coach Jim Donnan , Gary became a better football player . His sophomore year at Marshall , he rushed for 514 yards on 69 carries ( a gaudy7.3-yard average ) , and nine touchdowns . While carrying the ball for the Thundering Herd , Gary picked up the nickname ' O-Zone . ' <p> When Donnan left Marshall to go to Georgia , Gary followed . Gary sat out the 1996 season in accordance with NCAA transfer rules . <p> In 1997 , Gary started four games at tailback , rushing for 381 yards on 66 carries and seven touchdowns . By his senior season in 1998 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine of 11 games and rushed for 698 yards on 143 carries . In the Bulldogs ' 35-33 victory over Virginia in the Peach Bowl , he was named MVP after rushing for 110 yards and two touchdowns . That performance should have been the highlight of Gary 's collegiate career . Or if not that , then perhaps his 169-yard , two-touchdown performance against South Carolina in 1997 . <p> Different standards <p> But then , Gary 's standards are different than most other people 's . If you ask him what his most cherished college memory is , Gary will point to Georgia 's overtime win at Auburn in 1996 , the season he sat out as a redshirt as Donnan struggled to get his program going . <p> ' I knew Coach D was a great coach , and he was n't doing really well at the time , ' Gary recalled . ' He was really feeling down , and there was n't much I could do . Just to see him get that first big win , especially in overtime , was a great feeling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Such sentiments do n't surprise Gary 's first coach . ' He is totally unselfish , ' McGroaty said . ' Back in high school , he was everybody 's friend . He was just as happy to see somebody else get to play and do well as he was to get 200 yards himself You know , in high school , you are always going to have some kids picking on other kids . That happened with us a few times . But Olandis was always there for the little guys . He 'd tell the guys doing the bullying , ' Hey , if you want to pick on somebody , you 'll have to mess with me . ' Of course , nobody ever did . Olandis was always a quiet kid , but he always commanded respect . ' <p> Now the Broncos know that , too . <p> Gary may never be an NFL star . When Davis returns next season , Gary might slip back into the shadows . But for now , the young man who once cried because he wanted to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ask . <p> ' He 's tough , ' fullback Howard Griffith said . ' He 's going to get better as the year goes on . Right now he 's staying within himself and not trying to do too much . He 's giving this team exactly what it needs right now . ' @p#
