Several days before he shocked the world by becoming the most potent opposition figure in Russia , Vladimir Zhirinovsky stood in Moscow 's largest department store to ballyhoo his candidacy for his nation 's first freely elected parliament . In the midst of denouncing Boris Yeltsin 's reform program , Zhirinovsky , 47 , abruptly turned away from his audience , marched to a lingerie counter and seized an expensive brassiere . Twirling it on his fingers , he proclaimed that if he were voted into office , he would provide cheap underwear for his constituents . <P> That audacious act neatly summarizes the burlesque appeal of one of the most astute political grandstanders Russia has ever seen . The extended striptease by which Zhirinovsky both reveals and conceals his lust for power is at once vulgar and , at least by Russian standards , wildly entertaining . It is also a routine that has enabled him , in just three years , to become one of the most formidable  --  many would say farcical  --  forces in Russian politics . He has done so largely by trawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coursing through Russia 's muddy provincial towns and overcrowded apartment blocks . His incessant hammering at the resentment generated by the country 's plunge from great power to global beggar has made him a touchstone for the nation 's deepest pathologies . <P> Part of the secret of Zhirinovsky 's appeal is his ability to combine populist rhetoric with a crude yearning for ease and glory . Proclaiming slogans like " I 'm just the same as you , " he careens through Moscow in a motorcade of limousines , accompanied by a cadre of thuggish bodyguards that has included at least one member of the infamous Black Berets , the regiment of Soviet commandos that once terrorized the Baltic states . Even now , notes Oberlin College 's Frederick Starr , he adopts " the full trappings of a tin- horn dictator . " <P> The chubby-faced demagogue rose from obscurity in June 1991 , placing third out of six candidates in Russia 's first direct presidential elections . Despite losing his bid for Yeltsin 's chair , he seized upon the 6 million votes he received as license to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform lurches from the draconian to the absurd , from calls for summary executions to a proposal to turn the Kremlin into a round-the-clock entertainment center , with museums , restaurants and bars . One theme , however , has remained firm ever since he first sounded it in 1991 : " I say it quite plainly  --  when I come to power , there will be a dictatorship . " More recently he has added , " You can not rule by waving a chocolate bar in front of those you 're trying to rule . Or brandish only a whip . " <P> But last Sunday evening , when he moved a big step closer to his dream , he was holding up neither chocolate bars nor whips but a glass of champagne at the Kremlin party staged by reformers , which collapsed when the polls turned against them . Early the next morning , still pulsing with energy after a sleepless night , a euphoric Zhirinovsky attended a press conference at his party 's command post in a dilapidated Moscow building near the KGB 's former headquarters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
