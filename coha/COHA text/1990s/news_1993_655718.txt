<p> THE questions start from the moment one descends into the ornate lobby of Antwerp 's train station , ducks into a low-ceilinged coffee house , or hops the underground trolley to get a look at the historic Schelde River : Must we suffer for art ? What is beautiful , what is not ? Must artists be free ? <p> Can art save the world ? <p> The questions , printed in black on posters that feature reproductions of well known works of art , are the heart of the publicity campaign for this historic Flemish city 's run as the European " cultural capital . " For the organizers of a full palette of artistic activities designed to place Antwerp at the center of Europe 's cultural stage , the question mark - with all that it conjures up about doubt , introspection , rejection , and investigation - was the only honest way to approach culture in 1993 . <p> " In a Europe of pessimism , xenophobia , racism , and even war , it is not the time for slogans , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , " says Eric Antonis , director of Antwerp ' 93 , a nine-month festival that officially opens March 27 with a theatrical production entitled " Sarajevo . " <p> " We want to incite people to think , " he declares . <p> This is not the way Belgium 's second city envisioned its time in Europe 's cultural spotlight , following Madrid last year and cities such as Glasgow , Dublin , Paris , Berlin , and Amsterdam . The European Community has had a cultural capital every year since 1985 , when Greek Culture Minister Melina Mercouri came up with the idea and Athens inaugurated the project . <p> Given its long history and artistic tradition , Antwerp was not difficult to promote as a cultural capital . With the demise of Venice and the discovery of the New World , the city entered its golden age in the 16th century . The site of international trade fairs and a hub of the world economy , Flanders ' great Renaissance city was " a merry-go-round of goods , " says guide Paul De Wilde , noting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal works , publishing , and musical instruments . <p> When city officials submitted Antwerp 's candidacy in 1988 , their approach to symbolizing European culture was not going to differ substantially from previous cities . Europe 's mood was upbeat : A prosperous and stable Western Europe was enjoying sustained economic growth , and the EC was well along in its construction of a borderless economic area . <p> For Antwerp , taking the spotlight the first year of the EC 's single market would be a way to say there is more to Belgium than Brussels , and to be in the vanguard of Europe 's leap forward . <p> But since the confident days of 1988 , Europe 's economic and political situation have changed drastically , as has its mood . After the fall of the Berlin Wall shattered Europe 's postwar order , a short-lived euphoria gave way to a new bout of Euro-pessimism . <p> The EC now finds itself in a steep economic downturn , and many political leaders are facing popular rejection . At the same time , the broader European region is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instability , and mounting nationalism . <p> Amid this upheaval , the Antwerp of Peter Paul Rubens and Renaissance glory has not been left unscathed . In 1991 municipal elections , voters in this city of 465,000 shocked the establishment by giving the far-right separatist Vlaams Blok party a quarter of the vote , more than any other single party . Flemish separatism , strong in Antwerp , continues to wrack Belgium . <p> " Antwerp is a metaphor for what Europe is tempted by today , " says Mr. Antonis , noting the rising popularity of the far right . " This is actually an opportunity to put something like Antwerp ' 93 to work , to dig into these temptations , help people understand them and maybe even root them out . " <p> That view , while prevalent today among Antwerp ' 93 's young and energetic staff , was not the immediate response to the 1991 local election results . But after long debates , the staff agreed to persevere with the project by reinforcing the program 's " multicultural " element . <p> " We see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion between artists , their work , and society , " proclaims the festival 's performing arts team in its official calendar of events . <p> " How should we deal with the various cultures that want to live together in the same city ? This appears to be , " they conclude , " one of the fundamental questions for coming decades . " <p> A few examples of how Antwerp ' 93 hopes to promote this discussion : " Zingaro , " a circus opera employing a Georgian men 's choir , a Berber women 's choir , Gypsies , and a menagerie of 12 breeds of horses , donkeys , and geese , all performing together in harmony ; " Pigeons and Pencils , " a commissioned symphonic work performed by young musicians from Antwerp 's Moroccan community ; and the Antwerp ' 93 ark , a performing arts " refuge " that will stage groups of young dancers , musicians , and actors from around the world . ( See Ark , right . ) <p> ' I FOUND my program on the street , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the city 's Renaissance churches , which popularized the Flemish polyphonic musical style across Europe , to 19th-century cafes that once played popular pneumatic organs , and on to the 134 nationalities that make up today 's Antwerp , " it 's all right here , " he says . " You walk around this city and realize it 's full of references that make you think of music . " <p> These approaches has not always been well-received in Antwerp . Some Vlaams Blok representatives attacked the ark and the emphasis on multicultural performances , while others wanted the festival to be more of a showcase for Flemish culture . <p> But it is not just the far right or Flemish nationalists who have been critical . Some of Antwerp 's traditional powers have expressed uneasiness with parts of the festival as well - not with the multicultural aspect , which satisfies their political aim to defeat the far right , but with programs that draw attention to some of Antwerp 's weak spots . Some organizers say these jitters may reflect fears that Antwerp ' 93 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's entrenched leadership . <p> " We quickly learned that some of our ideas were not popular with the political coalition that has been in power in Antwerp for over 50 years , " says Pieter Uyttenhove , Antwerp ' 93 's architecture program director . <p> The architecture group decided to focus part of its effort on Antwerp 's 19th century belt , a swath of the city between the refurbished and touristy old center and the wealthy residential suburbs . <p> " That led to a clash with the mayor , " says Mr. Uyttenhove . " He said we were going too far into city prerogatives , but what he did n't want was us emphasizing and drawing the attention of international visitors to the part of the city where the worst problems are concentrated . " ( The mayor , Bob Cools , declined to be interviewed for this article ) . <p> Uyttenhove says it is also the 19th century belt that provides a base of far-right support . <p> " But it 's not just because people are racist that they vote for a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are frustrated with seeing always the same politicians in power , with a system where access to social housing and other benefits depends on your collaboration with the parties in power . " <p> In this sense , too , Antwerp symbolizes Europe - a Europe where voters , from Germany to Italy and France , are increasingly frustrated with traditional leaders and parties who have been in power for a decade or more . Mr. Cools is in the 13th year of his tenure , representing a coalition that has held city hall since the 1930s . <p> Recent polls suggest the Vlaams Blok could take 40 percent of the vote in Antwerp 's municipal elections next year . Antwerp ' 93 organizers hope the nine months of art-driven reflection their festival offers will prompt people to contemplate the dangers of xenophobic , closed-minded thinking . <p> " Antwerp was once one of Europe 's great cities , but it declined when the Schelde River was closed in 1585 and the wealth built on access to the outside world was choked off , " Antonis says . <p> " Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he adds . " I do n't know if art alone can save the world , but I hope that by the end of this year the art we have brought to Antwerp will have had a consequence , and people will leave extreme-right thinking behind .
