Section : News you can use Personal tech <p> Once upon a time  --  say , two versions of Windows ago  --  software and things digital were appropriate presents only for the seriously dweeby . But anyone who has watched a 4-year-old load a CD-ROM without incident or blithely peruse a Web site knows those days are gone . Tech gifts are n't exclusively for techies anymore . To underscore that point , we 've gone shopping for the fun stuff : the best console video games for the three leading platforms , Sony PlayStation , Nintendo 64 , and the newcomer that 's undoubtedly on the wish list of every 8-year-old , Sega 's Dreamcast . But we have n't left out the adults . We 've picked PC games for grown-ups that are heavy on nostalgia and relatively light on the gore . And rest assured : We have n't omitted intellectual development . So , with that , do n't get too technical this holiday . <p> LeapPad Learning Center ( ages 4-6 , $60 ) : It may look like a laptop for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compartment for four double-A batteries  --  but the LeapPad is actually more book than gadget . And it 's designed for little ones just learning how to read phonetically . You open up the case and insert a spiral-bound paper book , an original adventure about a frog named Leap . But it 's the LeapPad 's little radio-wave stylus that wirelessly communicates with the hardware inside the case that makes the book interactive . Kids begin by tapping the " Go " button on the first page , then move on to the beginning of the story . Each page of the tale is read aloud in a friendly , recorded human voice , and after that , kids can point the stylus to any word to hear how it sounds or have it spelled out . They can also point at individual letters to hear what sounds they make in the context of that word . <p> What 's nice about the LeapPad is that little kids get a laptop-lookalike of their own , but are reading a real book instead of words on a computer screen . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever word or letter they choose one at a time , but they also get the whole context of the words and the story . But it 's not an automatic pilot . Users will at first need some help from parents with the stylus and navigating their way through the books . Educational <p> I Spy Junior ( ages 3-5 , Windows 95/98 and Macintosh , $30 , Scholastic ) : Books do n't always make their way from paper to screen creatively intact , but I Spy Junior by Jean Marzollo , with illustrations by Walter Wick , definitely does . Based on the book series , this CD-ROM for little ones also features original , clever illustrations , which contain hidden pictures that kids discover by solving riddles . I Spy Junior does not segment subjects such as counting and rhyming , but rather mixes them all into brain puzzlers in which kids learn how to observe , identify , and make decisions . <p> Kids can choose to explore six areas  --  including a nature setting , a room full of hula-hoops , and one packed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different skill . In the nature scene , for instance , the goal is to match the riddles ' words with objects in the pictures . These are straightforward at first , but as kids progress , finding items gets tougher , and they 're given a " magnifying glass " to take a closer look at the critters they 've been asked to track down . <p> The illustrations and animation in I Spy Junior are genuinely cute , without being cloying , and the program does n't imprison children in any one area . If they do n't want to finish a screen , they are n't penalized , and they do n't have to complete each one sequentially ; the software does n't force them to go from easiest to hardest . In that sense , it 's just like the book . <p> I Spy Spooky Mansion ( ages 6-10 , Windows 95/98 and Macintosh , $30 , Scholastic ) : Based on the same book series , riddling games , and learning principles as I Spy Junior , this CD-ROM is aimed at slightly older kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and charged with solving more than 20 puzzles  --  that is , if they want to be let out of the house . <p> Just as in I Spy Junior , the artwork and music are witty , beautifully done , and original ( note to worried parents : the spooky-meter does n't hit the saccharine Casper level , but nor is it truly scary to kids who frighten easily ) . And though children are called on to exercise a wide range of skills , they are n't quizzed . They 're encouraged to use creative problem solving , such as classifying and sorting , logic , and following directions . Bonus : In one of the rooms , kids can make their own I Spy riddles . <p> Zap ! ( ages 8-12 , Windows 3.1/95/98 and Macintosh 7.0 , $30 , Edmark ) : The educational-software landscape for ' tweeners is congested with drill-and-practice programs , and while these flashcard-style arcade games may be fine for grilling kids on facts , they do n't leave much up to the imagination . Zap ! however , does , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative rarity in the commercial market . <p> Zap ! is an intro-to-engineering package , teaching kids about lasers , sound waves , and electricity . Because that does n't sound terribly glamorous to the average kid , the software offers a plot involving the user as a director of a rock concert , whose laser , sound , and electrical equipment needs to be repaired before the show proceeds . Although the cartoons can be dorky , the science puzzles are engaging , giving kids just enough information to solve problems and move on . In the Laser Lab , kids experiment with principles of light and color by bending lasers through filters , lenses , and around objects . In the ElectroLoft , they learn how to assemble " working " circuits , and in the SoundWave Studio , they can see sound 's amplitude and its effect on the listener . <p> Nothing beats the real thing , but the results of the experiments that kids conduct in these virtual laboratories mimic what they 'd find in the real world . <p> Age of Empires II : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Windows 95/98 ) : Now near the top of the bestseller list , The Age of Kings is clearly an educational game . But it may be best at training players how to be multitasking executives . You are in charge of building a civilization ; so while you train peasants to grow food , mine gold , and build ships , you must teach warriors to fight the pesky marauders that constantly invade your town and hack your hard-working peasants to death . Accumulate enough wealth and you can launch expeditions to hack other towns ' peasants . Or you can use the wealth for scientific accomplishment . Similar in style to other strategy games like Sid Meier 's Civilization , Command &; Conquer , or Warcraft , the different scenarios ( Mongols sweeping the steppes , Vikings marauding ) will keep the game fresh for months . Entertainment <p> Totally MAD ( ages 10 and up , Windows 95/98/NT , $70 , Broderbund ) : What  --  you worry ? This seven-CD-ROM collection of every MAD magazine ever published takes away the fretting over what to buy your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't often translate well into digital form , but this one does because it grasps , and exploits , MAD 's patented brand of hilarity , the scurrilously good-natured send-up . Best , Totally MAD 's appeal is ageless . Any off-center family member or associate who grew up between 1952 and 1998  --  and you know who they are  --  will go for it . <p> It 's all here : almost 50 years of movie and TV parodies ; Sergio Aragones 's slapstick marginal cartoons ; Dave Berg 's goofy cultural critiques in " The Lighter Side of . . . " ; Spy vs . Spy ; and more leering Alfred E. Neuman magazine covers than you may care to gaze upon . For those who grew up with the magazine , E-flipping through this collection is the next best thing to a jaunt back to childhood . There 's the old Jaws ( " Jaw 'd " ) and Welcome Back , Kotter ( " Welcome Back , Klodder " ) satires , the startling ubiquity of cigarette ads , and " MAD 's All-Inclusive Do-It-Yourself Impeachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only problems with the package are that it wo n't run on Macintosh and it 's a hassle to constantly swap seven disks . <p> Army Men : Toys in Space ( 5 and up , $30 ; Windows only ) : Remember the little plastic army men we blew up as kids ? Game maker 3DO has put them on the screen for parents who either want to relive the sandbox days or find an acceptable shoot-em-up game for their kids . The violence is clearly in fun , with plastic bits exploding rather than bloody carcasses . And the game is witty and imaginative . Kids fight ants or hide behind Coke cans left out in the sandbox as they battle the evil tan soldiers and their allies , aliens with death rays . After playing the preset scenarios , you can also assemble your army men for a free-for-all of the games Capture the Flag or King of the Mountain . The first two versions of the game have been assembled in a " Freedom Pack " ( $30 ) , but the soldiers in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also available for PlayStation and Nintendo 64 game consoles . Video games <p> Since it made its American debut last September , the Sega Dreamcast ( $200 ) has captivated the attention of more than 1 million gamers with its ability to deliver crystal-clear graphics and high-speed game play courtesy of twice the power of its nearest competitor . The Dreamcast already has 40 games available , and some of these are clearly a generation ahead of the rest of the pack . <p> Power Stone ( ages 13 and up , $50 ) : This fighting game is a knockout that raises the stakes in video-game punch-outs without adding gore . Players assume the role of one of eight characters  --  ranging from the petite Ayame , who works as a cherry-blossom dancer , to the massive Gunrock , who toils in mines . Each fighter is on a quest to win a mythical jewel that grants wishes . To capture the gem , the player has to beat all the other characters in hand-to-hand combat . <p> In most video games , this challenge alone would be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix . First , in order to use a character 's high-powered special attacks , you have to collect three gems that appear periodically throughout the game . You recall how the cartoon sailor Popeye pumps up after eating spinach ? The gems in Power Stone have the same effect on your character . ( When the British fighter pilot character Falcon collects three gems , he literally transforms into a human missile . ) But if your opponent collects all three jewels first , you are going to be in for some serious punishment . <p> And do n't think you 'll be safe if you stay out of your sparring partner 's reach . In this game , the crates and barrels that are just decoration in other fighting games can be hurled as weapons , the game 's other innovation . Each arena , whether it 's the Wild West-style bar or the pirate ship , is completely interactive . Smaller characters such as Ayame or the kung-fu master Wang Tang can hang from the rafters to attack their opponents from above while big characters like Gunrock or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings to swing like baseball bats . <p> These elements  --  the bare-knuckle sparring and the barrel dodging  --  combine to make a game that is addictively fun once you adjust to all the action . Because of the Dreamcast 's fast computing power , the game does n't slow down when the on-screen action heats up . <p> NBA 2K ( all ages , $50 ) : If your kids are ready to go one-on-one with basketball superstars such as Shaquille O'Neal and Grant Hill , this Dreamcast game is for them . This title is a worthy successor to Sega 's popular NFL 2K ( $50 ) . What made NFL 2K great was not only the action on the field but also what happened on-screen between plays . The game mixed shots of the players walking back to the huddle with sportscaster commentary in a manner more like TV 's Monday Night Football . <p> Such is also the case with NBA 2K . Sure , the players are detailed enough that you can see scoring champion Allen Iverson 's trademark cornrow hairstyle or New York Knicks forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs off the court , where the audience actually responds to the game , a rarity in video games . The crowd members stand and cheer when the home team scores and wave balloons when the opposing team shoots free throws . <p> It 's these details that make Dreamcast and its games stand out . But do n't feel you have to ditch the Nintendo 64s and PlayStations you already have in your house . There are several great new games for these systems that will make kids cheer this yuletide . <p> Jet Force Gemini ( ages 13 and up , $60 ) : If interstellar action is what your kids crave , this Nintendo tale of three childlike soldiers battling an evil empire of insects is just for them . Juno , his twin sister , Vela , and their dog , Lupus , are stuck on the edge of the galaxy , the only Federation spaceship to survive an attack from the swarms of Mizar , the Alien Insect warlord . The three split up , preparing to make their last stand on the planet of Goldwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games , in which players control one character for essentially the whole game , Gemini forces kids to maneuver each of its three main characters through various scenarios in order to win . They use Vela to swim long distances underwater , Juno to walk on fire , or Lupus to jump far . The mix makes this title less repetitive than most other video games . <p> Donkey Kong 64 ( all ages , $70 ) , Nintendo 's other big title this holiday season , also requires players to maneuver several characters to complete the game . This is an entirely different beast than the legendary Donkey Kong arcade game of almost two decades ago . In DK64 , players control the ape , Donkey Kong , or one of four other childlike apes  --  Diddy Kong , Tiny Kong , Lanky Kong , and Chunky Kong  --  on a mission to protect their island home from the lizard King K. Rool 's ravaging Blast-o-Matic cannon . <p> Donkey Kong 64 is so massive it will captivate kids for weeks or months . The reason the game costs more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it includes a memory expansion  --  an optional enhancement for other games , a requirement for DK64 . Like Jet Force Gemini , players also have to use different characters to finish different parts of the game . <p> Spyro ( 2 ) : Ripto 's Rage ! ( all ages , $40 ) : It is not easy being a heroic , pintsize purple dragon . Just when you head out for vacation on the Dragon Shores , a reptile-riding , spellcasting nutcase by the name of Ripto decides to enslave the peaceful nation of Avalar . Of course , you have to save the kingdom . But can you still get to the beach on time ? <p> That 's the challenge of Spyro ( 2 ) : Ripto 's Rage ! , one of the best new games for the Sony PlayStation . Like its million-selling predecessor , Spyro ( 2 ) offers a winning blend of sharp animation , clever characters , and challenging game play . What 's different about Spyro ( 2 ) is that it is adaptable to every player 's ability . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $50 ) ; Kids who like creepy thrills will love Resident Evil 3 : Nemesis , for PlayStation , the newest installment in this popular horror series . Like the Night of the Living Dead movies , RE3 pits its heroine , Jill Valentine , against the mutant zombies of Raccoon City . Controlling Jill and later South American mercenary Carlos Oliveira , players race to escape from the town . <p> The Resident Evil games have thrived on the strength of their suspenseful story lines and top-notch animation . Improvements , such as the ability to use different objects in the room as shields , enhance the game play . <p> That about covers the world of PCs and console video games . But there 's one category of digital toys left . Handheld <p> Which software for the Palm organizer makes the best gift ? If you 're not a Palm user , it is tough to know exactly what to offer the person who furiously scribbles notes on her gizmo during every conversation and delights in downloading new " apps " for it . <p> Would she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a use for HackMaster , which lets users customize Palm 's interface ? <p> The short answer is " Maybe , " but it 's tough to know . Palm users are among the pickiest of all tech consumers , and techies are arguably the fussiest consumers overall . So trust us when we say Palm users alone know what they want , and nothing else will do . For them , the gift that really gives is a gift certificate from PalmGear H.Q. ( http : **39;1672;TOOLONG ) ; $25 and up , and to be suitably Palmy , send it via E-mail . <p> There is one exception . If you know your favorite Palm fanatic will be traveling to Las Vegas , San Francisco , Paris , or Sydney for the holidays , consider Lonely Planet 's CitySync ( $20 ) , scheduled to ship this week . A Palm-software guide to those cities , CitySync comes complete with restaurant , hotel , and entertainment reviews , as well as directories of popular attractions and activities . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : LeapPad Learning Center <p> PHOTO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neumann <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : I Spy Junior <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Microsoft 's Age of Empire II <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Toy soldiers battle in the digital age . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Lonely Planet <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Spyro ( 2 ) : Ripto 's Rage <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Power Stone shown on a Sega Dreamcast <p> By Damon Darlin ; Kenneth Terrell ; Susan Gregory Thomas <p>
