// Last fall , while hunting in Iowa and Kansas , I had the good fortune to take nice bucks during each of the three phases of the rut-late pre-breeding , peak breeding and post-breeding . In each case , I took advantage of the terrain features offered in each area , as well as the very specific whitetail behavior of the moment . These might have been unique experiences , but not that unique : They can also be viewed as prototypes . The setups you 'll read about here are classic ambush sites . I chose to hunt with a bow , but they 'll work just as well for rifle and shotgun hunters , and they 'll work throughout the country . Consider them guidelines for how your whitetail strategy should evolve as the rut progresses this fall . Hunt 1 Photograph // Late Pre-Breeding When bucks began to abandon their late-summer feeding patterns last season , I focused my efforts on a productive-looking river bottom ( illustrated above ) . By wading the murky flow and then edging carefully under the high cutbank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hunt through the back door , without moving deer out of the way in the process . Cover stretched in every direction beyond my chosen tree . An abandoned 10-acre pasture partially grown over with plum thickets and oak saplings was sandwiched between two larger blocks of brushy timber . A small crop field lay just past the old pasture , and beyond that stretched miles of tall CRP grass interspersed with wild plums . After a few false starts , and nearly sinking in over my waders , I finally made it across the river . The stand went up and I cleared a narrow shooting lane to the pasture . My weather radio called for a westerly wind the next day-perfect . I got out of the woods and waited . On the morning of October 31 , a crisp wind blew in my face as I approached the creek , pulled on my waders and carefully retraced my tracks to the base of the tree . Due to the remoteness of the crop field , deer felt comfortable feeding late into the morning before drifting back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours after sunrise when a big old doe jolted me to full-alert . For the next halfhour deer filed into the abandoned pasture nonstop . Seven bucks and at least as many does made their way across . Only one was close enough for a shot , but he was the biggest . At 15 yards he gave me a clean broadside shot . I climbed down to go for help in tracking him , and was surprised to find the buck lying dead right at the edge of my river crossing . Best stands : Just before the first does come into estrus , bucks begin ramping up their daytime activity level . Feeding areas are the first places you 'll notice this change in behavior . Bucks will skulk into feeding areas earlier in the afternoon-along with the does-and they 'll linger later into the morning . Stands located between bedding and feeding areas are your best bet now . Set up an ambush at a midpoint between the two destinations so your entry and exit wo n't be spotted by deer while they 're bedded or feeding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns . Hunt 2 Photograph // Peak Breeding Situated in the middle of the area I was hunting a few days later was a long ridge that a majority of local deer used as a bedding area . A creek ran the length of the ridge on one side with a tributary feeding into it at a 90-degree angle , right across the face of a point . Several long fingers of brush extended out from the creek bottom into farmland . I started my assault on the ridge , in stands located in the narrow brushy fingers far from the bedding area . I did n't want to put too much pressure on those deer , so I planned to hunt easy-access stands on the fringes of the core area . I would n't move onto the ridge proper until I 'd played out all the other options and had nothing left to lose . Four days into the hunt I began working my way in , hunting crossings on both the main creek and the tributary that would concentrate moving deer . My reward came on November 7 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was sitting in a stand overlooking a tremendous funnel where one of the brushy fingers joined the creek bottom . It was still early in the afternoon but already three small bucks had come past . With such a strong start , I expected big things that evening . Ninety minutes into my sit , around 3:00 p.m. , I spotted a buck crossing the finger from right to left . I pulled up my binoculars and studied him as he stopped to rub a tree . When he turned my way and showed off his spread my eyes popped wide , and I instantly let the binoculars down . He apparently had no-where in particular to go because it took only three grunts from my call to get him headed my way at a trot . When he was at 35 yards and closing fast I drew my bow . By the time I got settled in at full draw the buck was only five yards from my stand and had slowed to a walk . I do n't remember deciding to shoot ; my autopilot must have kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blink my eyes to make sure it had all really happened . Yep . When I refocused on the brush pile 10 yards on the other side of the tree , the buck was lying under it . Best stands : When does start coming into estrus , bucks go on the move , so it makes sense to shift your efforts toward funnels that bring the maximum number of travel routes into shooting range . Stay away from bedding and feeding spots during peak breeding to avoid educating deer . Ideally , the funnels you sit on should connect two large bedding areas-bucks will cruise between them in search of the next available doe . Several days into the breeding period , when does come into estrus in full force , bucks will cruise ridges all day long . Do n't hunt your ridgetop spots too soon or you 'll end the action before it even begins . And hunt carefully enough to avoid spooking your live lures-the does-away from your stands . Be patient and slowly work in from the fringes . Hunt 3 // Post-Peak Breeding Two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushy ridge that held a dozen small draws reaching up from the timbered creek bottom below . Any one of the draws could serve as a travel route for a big buck heading up to his bedding area on the ridgeline after a night spent looking for does and freshening scrapes in the bottoms . I only had to pick the right one . From the top of the ridge I could see three draws . Two were unremarkable , but in the third something caught my eye : Five big rubs traced a route up its far side . It was obvious that a real hoss had been traveling here . A closer look at the rubs revealed that the buck was hitting them in the morning-the shined sides faced down the hill , away from the bedding area . I 'd found the spot within the spot , but there was still the matter of choosing the right tree . I decided my stand would have to be either on top of the ridge or along the creek in the bottom . I did n't want to hunt on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the draw itself was out because it was too wide to cover from a single stand . So , hoping for a light wind that would n't swirl much , I opted for the lesser evil down in the creek bottom , where distinct trails and creek crossings made travel easier to predict . The stand went up in an old oak from which I could cover trails along both sides of the creek plus a crossing that led toward the draw . It was well after sunrise , on the morning of November 22 , before deer began working their way out of the fields and timbered bottoms toward my stand and the ridgetop beyond . Movement was starting to die down when I heard a heavy grunt over my left shoulder . Whipping my head around I saw a huge body and massive rack drop off my side of the creek and down into a crossing 40 yards behind me . I do n't know if the buck had come down the draw , but I knew he was the kind of deer that could have made those rubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank , the buck stopped and appeared indecisive . I took that as my cue to grunt . Fifteen long motionless seconds ticked off before he turned and slowly walked toward my stand along the opposite bank , sending a load of adrenaline into my bloodstream . At 22 yards he came broadside in a narrow shooting lane , and the arrow was gone . I found the buck very dead just beyond the spot where he 'd first disappeared from sight . Best stands : The wind-down period after peak breeding can be the best time to find the biggest buck around . During the previous two phases of the rut , old bucks keep a pretty low profile , either waiting in the shadows or tending does . But now , with most of the does bred , these old warriors pick up their daylight movement level ever so slightly in search of the last few candidates for their favors . With the pressure of the rut easing , big bucks also start to fall back into their regimented routine , and a good place to look for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify a big-buck bedding area is to search for large rubs near traditional cover : ridgetops , points , knolls or thickets . Stands overlooking rub lines , scrape lines or narrow funnels in these areas should produce . Photograph // <p>
