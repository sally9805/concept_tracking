THE TREMORS THAT HAVE BEEN SHAKing troubled Apple Computer for more than a month turned into quakes last week  --  but the upheaval left many observers confused . All last Friday the company kept silent amid a blizzard of news reports that its board had ousted chief executive officer Michael Spindler and chairman Mike Markkula . Their replacement was said to be Gilbert Amelio , an Apple director and chairman and CEO of chipmaker National Semiconductor . The speculation became a continuous buzz when it was learned that Amelio had abruptly quit National Semiconductor . But it was hours before Apple released a brief statement confirming Amelio 's arrival and Spindler 's departure , and noting that Markkula , an Apple cofounder , was returning to the post of vice chairman . <P> But what did the shake-up mean ? Most Silicon Valley analysts took it as a signal that Apple , which lost $69 million in the fourth quarter of last year , had abandoned its behind-the-scenes effort to merge with Sun Microsystems , at least for now . ( Sun was reportedly offering a meager $23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 291/4 . ) " Amelio 's history shows that he emphasizes turning around companies , not selling them off , " says consultant Tim Bajarin of Santa Clara , California . <P> A turnaround would be no small task . The German-born Spindler , 53 , known as " the Diesel " for his drive , was himself brought in as a miracle worker by Markkula , when Apple 's share of the personal-computer market hovered at 9.4% . Now it is just 7.8% . The company was hard hit last year by the arrival of Microsoft 's Windows 95 operating system , which mimics the look and feel of Apple 's Macintosh computers but runs on IBM-compatible machines that are cheaper . <P> Amelio , 52 , seems a plausible choice as Apple 's next savior . When he arrived at National Semiconductor in 1991 , the company was nearly bankrupt . Last year it reported record profits of $264 million on sales of $2.4 billion . Amelio chopped the 33,000-employee work force by nearly one-third , closed or sold five of the company 's 14 factories and devised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy is what Apple desperately needs . Under Spindler , the company constantly flirted with expensive new projects while its core business swooned . Apple is laying off 1,300 of its 14,500 workers as part of a restructuring Spindler launched last month but which was clearly not seen as enough . Some experts doubt that Amelio will have better luck . " The change of guard gives the appearance of a fresh start , but Amelio can not change the fundamentals of the company , " says Richard Shaffer , editor of Technologic Partners Newsletter . Apple is trapped as a niche player in the very PC market it helped create , he says . In other words , watch for the ground to shake further . <P>  --  By John Greenwald . Reported by David S.
