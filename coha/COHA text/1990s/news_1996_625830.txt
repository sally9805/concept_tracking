<p> It must have been a great scene at that hotbed of entertainment , the Hilton Hotel in Allentown , Pa . <p> The Orlando Magic was stuck there because of the blizzard that diverted the team 's flight from Cleveland to Philadelphia , left to mingle with the other unfortunate souls also stranded there : the cast from " " Sesame Street Live " and the punk band Marilyn Manson , which was playing at a wedding reception at the hotel . <p> Shaquille O'Neal , Penny Hardaway and the gang ended up in the hotel bar last Sunday night partying with whoever was left from the wedding party . The eclectic group of NBA players , tattoo-laden rockers and prim-and-proper wedding guests played darts and drank . <p> " " I told somebody it was like the scene in " " Star Wars " where you have all the animals from different planets in the bar , " Jon Koncak said . " " Sesame Street , " Nine Inch Nails , a wedding party and us . I thought we were in the " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverse group of people and stick them together if you tried . It was hilarious . " <p> Actually , the band was n't Nine Inch Nails but Marilyn Manson , a group under the same recording label as Nine Inch Nails . For the uninitiated , Marilyn Manson ( and Nine Inch Nails , for that matter ) leans toward dark , gloomy music and appearance . And one particular band member apparently scared the players . <p> " " The Grim Reaper ? I could n't look him in the eye , " Koncak said . " " I figured if I made eye contact three times , I 'd be dead . " <p> Said Horace Grant : " " He had 10 times more tattoos than Dennis Rodman . " <p> Would n't you just love to see the scrapbook from the wedding ? <p> Instead of these nice matted prints of the young couple nuzzling each other and embracing family and friends , you get photos of Nick Anderson breaking beer bottles everywhere because he ca n't hit the trash can with his empties . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's better not to be noticed . Just ask Dick Motta . <p> The Mavericks ca n't even get into the first 10 pages of the Dallas Morning News sports section because the town and newspaper have gone crazy over the Cowboys . <p> Considering the Mavs are pathetic , it 's not such a bad deal going unnoticed . <p> " " Thank God for the Cowboys , " Motta said . " " We 're praying for them to make it to the Super Bowl . That would take us through the All-Star break . By that point , we could start thinking about the lottery , and people would be rooting for us to lose so we can get a good player . " <p> That 's the Mavericks spirit we all know and love . <p> New hair trend ? - Big , tall , long Afros might be the rage in the NBA soon . <p> Well , there might be one of them , anyway . Toronto 's Carlos Rogers says he wo n't cut his hair until the Raptors win three in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season ? <p> We 're not worthy - Even after a victory , New York 's Charles Oakley thinks the Knicks are n't good . <p> When the Knicks beat Boston by six Tuesday , the Oak Tree said : " " It should n't have been that close . They 're not a good team . <p> But , really , a decent team plays .500 , a good team plays .600 , and a great team plays .800 . We ca n't be impressive until we win games against the teams like Chicago and Orlando . " <p> Which they have n't . And wo n't , barring a miracle trade . <p> Even in the weak Eastern Conference , the Pacers and maybe the Cavaliers and Heat could give the Knicks a run for third place . <p> Said Oakley : " " We 're no powerhouse , that 's for sure . Cleveland beat us , Portland beat us and now New Jersey . That says it all . " <p> By the way , the Knicks have won 12 in a row over Boston , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were by Milwaukee and Chicago - the Stags , not the Bulls . <p> The streak against Milwaukee ended Oct. 29 , 1971 . The streak against the Stags ended when the club went out of business after the 1949-50 season . <p> Florida Whine Cellar - What is it about Portland 's Rose Garden that brings out the worst in game officials ? <p> First , the replacement refs ( remember them ? ) allowed Arvydas Sabonis ' hook shot to count and kill the Rockets even though it came after the buzzer ending the second overtime . <p> Now , Miami coach Pat Riley has this to say after the Heat 's 90-89 loss Wednesday that was laced with questionable calls . <p> " " That was one royal . . . , " he said . " " It has got to stop . <p> They are anticipating every call before it happens . <p> Thirty-seven fouls on us and 27 on them . I have had it . Our guys are playing too hard . <p> " " That last call on Bimbo ( Coles , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is a travesty to justice and to what is fair in this game . It had no effect on the play ; it was just to make the Heat lose , period . I 'm not saying any more . " Somebody remind him that there 's no whining allowed in the NBA . The Rockets did n't even so much as send any film to the league when they got beat by Sabonis ' shot . <p> Two who could be on the move - Two players who seem eager to force a trade are Charles Barkley and Tim Hardaway . <p> Barkley is n't enjoying himself with the Suns , who have fallen so far out of the race in the Western Conference , they 'll never catch up . <p> " " Obviously , things are in disarray here , " Barkley said . " " If we <p> get healthy , we 'll be very formidable . But that 's a big ' if ' considering the last two years . " <p> Barkley added he could retire rather than go to an unwelcome situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens . The last time I checked , I had $ 20 million . And that was before the latest McDonald 's deal . " <p> Then , Barkley really got upset . <p> " " I 've got news for you : This is as good as it gets , " he said . <p> When a reporter said that if the Suns trade Barkley , they would be conceding they no longer have what it takes , he said : " " I can concede that right now , without making a trade . They 've made some weird trades around here . Another one would n't hurt . " <p> Saying he does n't grovel , the Chuckster refused to say he wanted to stay in Phoenix . <p> As for Hardaway , he shot 0-for-9 from the field Thursday against the Suns . Either his once-dominating skills are gone or he has simply given up in the Bay Area . <p> Not showing off - Some players try to put on a show for Atlanta coach and 1996 Olympic coach Lenny Wilkens , but not Sacramento @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7-for-18 in two games this season against the Hawks and probably has no chance for one of the final two Olympic spots for the Atlanta Games . <p> Richmond is a great player , but he 's getting far too much mileage out of the underrated angle . <p> He 's not underrated . He 's a deserving All-Star . But he 's also no Michael Jordan or Clyde Drexler . <p> In a zone . . . defense , that is - Phil Jackson does n't much care for the way George Karl coaches the Seattle SuperSonics . When Jackson 's Bulls and the Sonics hooked up Wednesday , Jackson needed no prodding to put the needle to Karl . <p> " " They play a zone defense , " he said . " " They have to turn the game into an ugly scrum match . If they can get the game turned into that kind of ugly game , then they can win . " <p> Responded Karl : " " It sounds like he 's whining like he does every time someone gets aggressive against his team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of respect . " " Phil has always tried to have this idealism of basketball , of execution , of perfection of style . But basketball is an imperfect game . It 's a game of mistakes as much as a game of finesse . It 's a game of big guys as much as a game of little guys . It 's not only one way . " <p> The guess here is that , if Karl had Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen on his side , his strategy would look a lot more appealing to the eye . <p> He 's back - The way Washington 's Mark Price made his return was weird . For some reason , he did n't want anybody to know he was coming back Wednesday against the Sixers . <p> He told only his brother . Then , just before game time , he told coach Jim Lynam and asked him not to alert the media . <p> Lynam agreed to play Price in five-minute stretches in relief of brother Brent Price , who was subbing for injured starter Robert Pack . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To say Price looked like something less than a four-time All-Star would be generous . He missed eight of his first nine shots and clearly was out of sync . <p> But when he entered the game for the final crucial moments , he responded by knocking down a 3-pointer for a 94-87 Washington lead to sew up the game . <p> " " I still have a little bit of killer instinct in me , " he said , " " and if I have that shot , I 'm going to take it . It did n't bother me missing those other shots . I 've been in those shoes before . " <p> The Bullets , by the way , want to stay on good terms with Pack . <p> Even though they want Mark Price to be their point guard this season , they know the free-agent-to-be will explore playing for a quality veteran team next season . <p> Pack is a good player but mistake-prone . Nevertheless , without him , the Bullets would be five or 10 wins worse than they are . <p> More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown before the Feb. 22 trading deadline , and Minnesota could be a landing spot . The rumored deal involving Isaiah Rider is not an option . More likely is a three-way deal that would leave Brown in Minnesota . <p> " " We 've talked about doing some stuff , but that ( Brown for Rider ) was not the deal , " Wolves GM Kevin McHale said . <p> " " They 're thinking about moving Dee , and we wanted to see what they needed . <p> " " I know everyone 's a little down on him back in Boston , but I think he can help a team . He 's not a point guard , and he 's not a two ( shooting ) guard , but he can do a little bit of both . <p> When you let him do what he can do , I think he can be effective for you . <p> NOTES : Eddie Sefko covers the Rockets and the NBA for the Chronicle .
