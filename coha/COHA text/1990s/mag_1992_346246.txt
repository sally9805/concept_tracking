CAPITALISM HAS CREATED MARKETS FOR SOME BIzarre products : pet rocks , pieces of the Beatles ' hotel bed linens , even Edsels . But last week a market to amaze even Adam Smith opened up : the buying and selling of the right to pollute , which proves that anything anyone wants to buy will be sold . <P> One of the nation 's cleanest utility companies , Wisconsin Power &; Light , agreed to sell pollution " credits " to two other companies , among them one of the nation 's dirtiest utilities , the Tennessee Valley Authority . This innovative , market-based deal , made possible under the 1990 Clean Air Act , will allow T.V.A. and the Duquesne Light Co. of Pittsburgh to spew larger quantities of sulfur dioxide into the air while WP &L; reduces its emissions . The arrangement is probably the first of many , and it should help lower the overall cost of curbing acid rain , since some utilities may opt to buy less costly rights now and delay more expensive efforts to cut back pollution . <P> Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clean air should be protected , not traded and sold like a used car , " says Christopher Blythe of the Citizens Utility Board , a Wisconsin consumer-protection group . " What 's next , the L.A. police department trying to buy civil rights credits from Wisconsin ? " While this trading system may increase the chance that some regions will suffer from more acid rain , it should encourage a nationwide cleanup of SO2 , which the Clean Air Act wants to reduce by 10 million tons a year . " I 'm not quite sure what people are complaining about , " says Daniel Dudek , senior economist for the Environmental Defense Fund . " We want to accomplish our environmental goals with the least pain possible to the economy . "
