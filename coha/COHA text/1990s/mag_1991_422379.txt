Section : Science &; society ; Cover story An obscure Austrian monk launched the field of genetics , but research over the past four decades has revolutionized it . With the new technologies of genetic engineering , every facet of modern medicine is now being transformed . <p> The winsome , sable-haired 4-year-old did n't even know she was making history , or care . By the time of the injection last year , she had been poked and prodded so often that she could not be bothered to take her eyes off the cartoon she was watching on TV . But to everyone else in her hospital room at the National Institutes of Health , this particular shot was ushering in the dawn of genetic medicine . <p> The injection marked the first human trial of gene therapy , a revolutionary means of treating a disease by giving a patient new genes . The girl suffers from an extremely rare , inherited disorder in which faulty genes have crippled her immune system , leaving her vulnerable to the slightest infection or illness . To treat it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with a new gene , and reinjected them into her body . Today , four months after her last dose of the groundbreaking therapy , the girl 's immune system appears to be fending off infections normally . <p> In the nearly 40 years since James Watson and Francis Crick elucidated the twisting structure of DNA , scientists have probed deeply the workings of the molecule that governs all living cells . They have learned how a single , mutated gene can clog the lungs of a child suffering from cystic fibrosis and how other lengths of DNA open a cell 's portals to the AIDS virus . Just in the last month , researchers have announced the discovery of at least four new human genes responsible for ailments ranging from deafness to sterility . And while finding a new gene is only a step toward vanquishing a disease , says Nobel laureate David Baltimore , president of Rockefeller University , " every disease we know about is either being attacked with genetics or is being illuminated through genetics . ' <p> Experiments with gene therapy represent a giant step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an advisory committee at the National Institutes of Health , which keeps a tight rein on such experiments , approved three more gene-therapy proposals to treat cancer and a deadly inherited form of high cholesterol . In other laboratories , scientists have rigged the lining of blood vessels with genes that deliver anticlotting drugs ; in still others , they are exploring genes that could make cells resistant to the AIDS virus . <p> Yet for all the good molecular medicine will do , the ethical dilemmas are grave . The advances bring closer the day when parents can endow children not only with health but also with genes for height , good balance or lofty intelligence  --  uses of genes that trouble most researchers and ethicists . Of more immediate concern is the possibility that health insurers , employers and the government will gain access to genetic information and unfairly discriminate against people on the basis of their genes . <p> Gene hunt . While ethicists and Congress ponder who should be privy to the secrets of an individual 's DNA , the pace of genetic discoveries is rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 of the human species ' estimated 50,000 genes . Now , with the advent of new technologies , the count stands at more than 2,200 , and over the next 15 years , an ambitious scientific endeavor known as the Human Genome Project will spend $3 billion developing even faster methods to identify the remainder . " Biology is in its golden age , " says Gary Nabel , a physician and gene therapist at the University of Michigan , who has watched the advent of genetics transform his profession . " When people are practicing medicine 50 years from now , they 'll be doing it in ways we would never have imagined . ' <p> Doctors have known since the time of Aristotle that certain families carry traits for diseases . But how those traits are passed between generations remained mysterious until the 1869 discovery of deoxyribonucleic acid , the immortal coil of inheritance known as DNA . This long and slender molecule spins out genetic instructions within nearly all living cells from conception until death . Inside a human cell , the strands are scrunched into 46 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye to see . Unwound and laid end to end , a single cell 's DNA would equal the height of a man . <p> Two key discoveries insured that genetics would dominate the future of medicine . In 1953 , Watson and Crick determined the manner in which DNA is constructed of four smaller molecules , called bases , which are strung together like letters in an alphabet . Within a decade , researchers solved the riddle of how DNA carries inherited traits from parents to child : They established that segments of DNA are , in effect , the words spelled out by this four-letter alphabet . Just as the English language uses 26 letters in various combinations to make thousands of different words , different arrangements and repetitions of these four bases make all of the body 's genes . Most genes are responsible for providing cells with instructions for making one of the thousands of proteins that form the building blocks of all cells and are essential for life . <p> The implications of these seminal discoveries were enormous for medicine . If scientists could ferret out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could understand and perhaps cure the 3,500 known inherited diseases . Inherited disorders result when a mutation in a gene gives cells faulty instructions to produce aberrant proteins . Sickle cell anemia , for example , is the tragic result of a single incorrect letter in the 60,000-letter gene for hemoglobin , a protein that carries oxygen and gives red blood cells their color . The tiny flaw in the gene produces a misshapen protein that can not bind oxygen , leading to excruciating pain , weakness and premature death . <p> By the 1970s , a handful of scientists had begun to speculate that such genetic disorders could be treated by inserting good genes into a sick person 's cells . Much of the impetus for gene therapy came from W. French Anderson , a physician at the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute , who first tinkered with using genes to correct illness in 1974 and pioneered last year 's first human experiment . The disease Anderson and his colleagues R. Michael Blaese and Kenneth Culver chose to investigate was adenosine deaminase ( ADA ) deficiency , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Desperate measures . Though very rare , the disorder was targeted for two major reasons : Researchers had already cloned , or duplicated , the gene for ADA in the lab , and their patient 's condition was desperate , since the only other treatment for the disease was failing her . In healthy people , ADA breaks down a naturally produced compound that is toxic . Without ADA , the compound builds up in immune cells and kills them . <p> In theory , gene therapy for ADA was deceptively simple . For this first experiment , the researchers removed immune cells from the girl 's blood , supplied them with good copies of the gene for ADA that they lacked and then put them back into the little girl 's veins , where the cells produced ADA . <p> In practice , however , the procedure was not only clever but exceedingly complex . The gene for ADA was ferried into the cells by special viruses , also the product of genetic manipulation . The viruses had been genetically crippled so that once they deposited their cargo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his colleagues incubated the girl 's rejuvenated immune cells in a tepid broth to increase their numbers , and then injected about a billion of them into her blood , where they appear to be thriving . <p> With the spectacular success of this first experiment , the gates have swung wide to an extraordinary array of therapies using engineered genes . Last month , the NIH 's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee , or RAC , approved three new trials , among them an experiment to treat three cases of familial hypercholesterolemia , a disease that can doom children to an old person 's death from heart attack . In this inherited disorder , mutated genes render the liver all but incapable of removing a particular form of cholesterol from the blood , and the arteries of a child with the disease are often lethally clogged by age 10 . <p> To correct this flaw , James Wilson of the University of Michigan and Howard Hughes Medical Institute plans to remove about 15 percent of a child 's liver and add good genes to the cells . Once the revitalized cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up some of the excess cholesterol in the child 's blood . <p> Nobody is expecting miracles from this experiment , least of all its architect . " We 're looking for an effect for a couple of years , ' explains Wilson . The problem with this and other genetic therapies is that most cells have finite lifespans  --  in some cases just a few weeks  --  and the therapeutic effects last only as long as the cells themselves . An experiment with rabbits , for example , lowered the fat in their blood by 40 percent for about 10 days . <p> For more long-term improvement and certainly any true cure , researchers have been searching for what is called a " stem cell , " a long-lived parent cell that serves to renew the many different types of cells in various tissues . In the liver , for instance , stem cells are thought to lie dormant until called upon to replace damaged or spent liver cells . Finding and tinkering with these hardy cells have become something of a holy grail for modern biology . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they proved exceedingly elusive until this year , when biologists at Stanford and SyStemix Inc. , a California biotech company , isolated what they believe is the human bone marrow stem cell . Assuming they are right , much still remains to be done before stem cells can actually be fitted with new genes . But when researchers succeed , they will be able to conquer many inherited disorders . <p> Even some diseases that are not inherited may one day succumb to gene therapy . Last month , the RAC approved two experiments , now underway , in which genetically engineered tumor cells are being injected into terminally ill cancer patients . Cancer spreads through the body by evading the immune system , and the goal of the new treatment is to teach the body 's immune cells to recognize and kill tumors . Steven Rosenberg , chief of surgery at the National Cancer Institute , removed tumors from his patients and endowed the cancer cells with a gene that makes tumor necrosis factor , a protein that regulates the immune system . <p> Immunity lessons . Rosenberg injected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin of his two patients ' thighs , where small tumors should grow . In theory , these genetically engineered lumps will teach the patients ' immune systems to recognize the peculiarities of their own cancer cells . Once instructed , their immune systems will seek out and destroy the rest of their tumors . <p> Ultimately , researchers would like to deliver genes directly to cells without removing them from the body . For example , Michigan 's Nabel hopes to win approval from the RAC for a scheme to send genes into tumors by wrapping the DNA in a fat particle , called a liposome . In animal experiments , he has injected liposomes near tumors and the cancer cells have willingly absorbed the DNA . <p> Gene therapy may also prove to be the most potent weapon against AIDS , even though it is not an inherited disorder . Nava Sarver , chief of the NIH effort to find new drugs against AIDS , estimates that there are dozens of strategies under investigation for using genes to make cells resistant to the AIDS virus . Biologists have now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can thwart the virus 's attempts to enter and to reproduce itself . Eventually , doctors will be able to catch patients soon after infection and bolster their cells with resistant genes . " Without molecular biology , treating AIDS would be impossible , a shot in the dark , ' says Sarver . " Now we have the knowledge to home in on specific targets in the virus and specific steps in the process of infection . ' <p> Indeed , there is hardly a malady that is not being tackled with the tools of genetics and molecular biology . From infectious diseases to the chronic killers like cancer and stroke , identifying the role of genes is now considered an indispensable step toward understanding the illness and one day conquering it . <p> The flood of new gene discoveries has already begun to explain a host of diseases . At the 8th International Congress of Human Genetics , held last month in Washington , D.C. , nearly 5,000 researchers from around the world described dozens of new bits of DNA . For example , a Scottish and German team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutation in a gene on the Y chromosome , the first mutation ever associated with male infertility . Another gene was linked to a susceptibility to multiple sclerosis , while a cluster of genes appears to make some people especially prone to cancer if they smoke . The genes in question govern enzymes that break down and eliminate toxic substances , and a smoker who carries these genes can develop tumors as many as 50 years earlier than a smoker with a different genetic makeup . <p> No disease has given up more of its secrets to genetic sleuths than cancer . Thirty years ago , both the understanding of tumors and the treatment for them were exceedingly crude . Doctors employed radiation and chemotherapy , but these were like using a cannon to kill sparrows , and the toxic side effects were often as bad as the cancer itself . Cancer 's cause was equally murky . Scientists had observed that cigarette smoke and certain chemicals caused tumors , but they had no clue how . <p> Genes , it turns out , control critical steps in the terrible pathway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erupt when the genes that tell cells to divide are mutated . The cell is permanently switched on by these so-called oncogenes , and it divides wildly out of control . Researchers have also uncovered genes that normally halt cell division , but when mutated fail to hold cells in check . At least five cancers owe their existence to these antioncogenes , including one for a childhood form of kidney cancer . <p> A cure for cancer has yet to emerge from this newfound knowledge , but understanding oncogenes has allowed scientists to sharpen their search . " We used to think that cancer came from something outside the cell , ' says John Minna , an oncologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center . " The fact that cancer is caused by mutations in normal genes switched our attention to factors inside the cell . Now it 's all fitting together . ' Instead of searching for toxic chemicals that are only slightly better at killing cancer cells than normal cells , researchers are seeking drugs that specifically block the actions of cancer-causing genes . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks the activation of an oncogene in breast cancer . <p> Already , cancer genes have made their way into hospital settings as diagnostic tools . The more copies of these " bad " genes in a patient 's breast , colon or lung cells , the worse the prognosis . The presence of the oncogene called neu in breast cancer cells , for instance , signals a particularly aggressive tumor and calls for the most radical treatment . <p> Indeed , DNA 's most significant contribution to all of medicine thus far is in the form of such diagnostic tests . Genetic probes now exist for an array of inherited disorders , such as hemophilia , muscular dystrophy and polycystic kidney disease , all of which can be detected even before birth . Soon , other tests will flag the subtle genetic tendencies toward more-common ailments such as heart disease and mental illness , and in the future , doctors will be able to identify many diseases before they happen and do something about them . <p> Test conundrums . In the meantime , however , many genetic tests grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ futures . The test for Huntington 's chorea , for example , does no more than tell those who bear the mutated gene that they will one day suffer a dreadful , progressive neurological decay that can not be treated . <p> Genetic tests will force parents to make wrenching decisions . Many might choose to abort upon learning their child bears the gene for a lethal illness , such as Tay-Sachs disease , a disorder that kills long before puberty . But what if the gene confers a slight tendency toward colon cancer , which wo n't show up , if it does at all , until the bearer reaches the age of 50 ? As testing becomes more widespread , so too will the need for genetic counselors , specialists trained to instruct parents and patients in the meaning of genetic test results . Even now , the American Society of Human Genetics is pondering the wisdom of testing all adults of child-bearing age for cystic fibrosis  --  about 100 million people . <p> The pressure to use genetic tests will be difficult to resist . According to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assessment , 20 percent of companies already use genetic tests on employees , in part to hold down corporate health-care costs . In addition , 15 percent of 400 employers surveyed by an insurer intend to screen prospective employees ' dependents . While such practices may make economic sense , ethicists worry that they are discriminatory , particularly since genetic traits often can not predict with certainty if or when their bearer will fall ill . A person carrying the recently discovered genes for lung cancer , for example , may avoid the disease by not smoking . <p> Health insurers , too , will be using genetic tests in the future , a prospect that many find troubling . Insurers routinely deny coverage to people with expensive " pre-existing conditions , " a list of dozens of diseases including many genetic disorders such as Huntington 's and sickle cell . Widespread genetic testing will greatly expand this list , since everyone carries at least five genes that could lead to serious illness . " Policies governing the use of genetic information need to be debated and put in place early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warns Robert Weinberg , an oncogene specialist at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge , Mass. , writing in Technology Review . <p> Society 's knotty decisions will become even more tangled as the massive Human Genome Project lumbers toward its goal of mapping the location of every human gene , including those that govern such traits as intelligence , coordination and grace . That knowledge will expand the potential of genetic engineering far beyond the correction of disease and push it toward the realm of social engineering . <p> Some find such prospects so harrowing that they would halt all genetic research . But most scientists believe the world must proceed into the new enetic age . " This notion that there are things too dangerous to know is fundamentally antiscience and antiprogress , ' says Baltimore . " It is not a good representation of what the human spirit wants . ' Rather , it is a reflection of fear . But while entering the age of genes indeed may be inevitable , society has a great deal of choice in how it uses the new knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POINTS IN BIOLOGY Although the study of heredity is 126 years old , most of the medical breakthroughs have taken place in recent decades . <p> 1865 ... THE GENETIC AGE BEGINS in a garden in Brno , Czechoslovakia , where the Austrian monk Gregor Mendel breeds and crossbreeds 22 strains of peas . Mendel cataloged the flowers ' colors and textures and the size of the plants his experiments produced to derive the laws of heredity . His results were so perfect , some historians suspect him of fudging his data . <p> A monk 's peas . Every pea plant bears two forms of a gene that determines what color flowers it will bear ( the two forms symbolized here as R and W ) . By crossing and recrossing pea plants , Mendel determined that red dominates white . 1869 ... DNA , THE STRINGY STUFF of inheritance that is often called the blueprint of life , is discovered by Johann Friedrich Miescher , a Swiss chemistry student who purified it from the sperm of salmon and from white blood cells oozing out of surgical wounds . Miescher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1952 ... THE " WARING BLENDER EXPERIMENT " proves DNA is indeed the substance that transmits inherited characteristics from one generation to the next . At the time , scientists were arguing whether genetic information is carried by a protein or by DNA , which is an acid . In what is now considered a biochemically sloppy experiment , Martha Chase and Alfred Hershey used the common kitchen appliance to separate the protein coats of viruses from their DNA to prove which is the real stuff of life . 1953 ... ASTRINGENT ECCENTRICS James Watson and Francis Crick unravel the double helix structure of DNA , along with Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins , at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge , England . Franklin died four years before the work was recognized with the 1962 Nobel Prize . 1964 ... SCIENTIFIC NOBODY Marshall Nirenberg cracks the genetic code . Along with his better-known colleagues Har Khorana and Robert Holley , Nirenberg deciphered the " language " that enables DNA to be translated into proteins , the building blocks of all living cells .

RECOMBINANT DNA COMES OF AGE : Stanford biochemist Paul Berg ties together two lengths of DNA from different species using " sticky ends , " which prove extraordinarily handy for gluing bits of DNA together . He shared a Nobel in 1980. 1974 ... CLONING THE GENE requires breaching barriers that normally separate species . Stanford 's Stanley Cohen , Annie Chang and Herbert Boyer spliced DNA from a frog into E. coli , which willingly churned out copies of the foreign gene . E. coli is now an indispensable cloning machine . 1975 ... READING THE GENETIC CODE one letter at a time : Walter Gilbert and Allan Maxam of Harvard University and Fred Sanger of Cambridge University come up with two techniques for determining the exact sequence of bases that make up a gene .

A BRAINSTORMING SESSION leads to a seminal idea by David Botstein , Ray White , Mark Skolnick and Ronald Davis , who devise a means for pinpointing the location of genes along a stretch of DNA . The key : RFLPs , or " riflips , " fragments of DNA whose lengths vary from person to person . 1982 ... MONSTER MICE are created by Richard Palmiter and Ralph Brinster by injecting mouse eggs with the gene for growth hormone . The technique allowed scientists to create " transgenic " mice that suffer human ailments . In 1988 , mice with engineered susceptibility to cancer became the world 's first patented life form . Some wonder how you patent something that can look you in the eye . 1990 ... A 4-YEAR-OLD GIRL with a rare genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NIH doctors inserted a gene into immune cells taken from her own blood . <p> Biology 's Moonshot , the Human Genome Project , begins . Cost : $3 billion . Goal : to map all the genes in the human body . <p> 1991 ... INTERNATIONAL FUROR ensues when the U.S. government quietly applies for patent rights to more than 300 genes whose functions are not yet known . Critics fear a " gene rush " by those hoping to cash in on biotech profits . The anatomy of a gene <p> Packed into nearly every cell in the body is a blueprint of sorts : the long , twisting strands of DNA , which encode the instructions for making all the proteins necessary for life . Inside the cell , 46 packets called chromosomes carry a total of 6 to 8 feet of tightly coiled DNA . Along its length lie our 50,000 genes , most of which carry the instructions for the body 's proteins . Unwound from the chromosome , a gene looks like a twisted ladder . In fact , it consists of two separate strands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases constitute the four-letter alphabet that makes up the genetic code . <p> Double helix of DNA : Adenine ( A ) bonds with thymine ( T ) .... guanine ( G ) bonds with cytosine ( C ) . From gene to protein <p> In an intricate series of events , the machinery of the cell deciphers the genetic code to manufacture proteins . First , DNA 's double helix splits down the middle like a zipper . This exposes its bases to the cell 's protein manufacturing machinery . Each base constitutes a letter in the genetic code , and every group of three bases corresponds to a particular subunit of protein , called an amino acid . The cell 's protein manufacturing machinery " reads " the bases three at a time . It then adds the corresponding amino acid to the growing chain , which will make up the final protein . Every protein consists of a particular sequence of amino acids , strung together like beads . The different sequences give each protein a different three-dimensional shape , which determines its function in the body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kemp for USN &WR); <p> Drawings : No caption ( Time Line Illustrations by James Noel Smith for USN &WR); <p> Drawings : The anatomy of a gene <p> Drawings : From gene to protein <p> Picture : No caption ( Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Archive ) <p> Picture : No caption ( Jackie Lewin-SPL/Photo Researchers ) <p> Picture : Gene pioneers .

A new technique for spotting genetic flaws at the Lawrence Livermore National lab ( Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ) <p> TINKERING WITH RODENTS TO PROBE HEREDITY 'S MYSTERIES Of mice and men <p> Pink , hairless and slightly larger than jelly beans , the newborn mice all look alike . But 10 weeks later , a few are twice the size of their full-grown siblings . No ordinary rodents , these " transgenics "  --  part mouse , part man  --  are helping revolutionize the study of genetics and illness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien piece of DNA  --  in this case , the gene that produces human growth hormone . Transgenics are created by injecting a foreign gene into fertilized mouse eggs , a technique that is producing better animal models for illuminating dozens of illnesses and testing possible treatments . Says Richard Palmiter of the University of Washington , a pioneer in the field , " The transgenic mouse is a wonderful experimental tool to study almost any question of genetics . ' <p> Engineered eggs . Though transgenics are increasingly commonplace in research , constructing the mice still leaves much to chance . Researchers use the same technique employed by Palmiter and Ralph Brinster of the University of Pennsylvania when they made their giant mouse , one of the first transgenics , in 1982 . They began by coupling the gene for growth hormone with a bit of DNA that regulates gene activity within cells . The scientists then removed a mouse 's fertilized eggs , less than 12 hours old and each far smaller than a period on this page . They injected hundreds of copies of their hybrid DNA into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster mother . <p> The technique does not always work . The hybrid genetic material sometimes disrupts a gene that is vital to the developing mouse , and often it simply fails to insert itself . As a result , only about 3 out of every 100 manipulated eggs develop into transgenic mice . Scientists have now devised a new technique , called homologous recombination , which allows them to aim a piece of DNA at a particular mouse gene and replace it . <p> A decade ago , the word " transgenic " had not been invented . In 1990 alone , more than 600 scientific papers described strains of transgenics with symptoms of diseases ranging from arthritis and diabetes to obesity . Thousands of varieties of these " guinea mice " are now providing models for testing possible treatments . Last month , scientists at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory reported they had protected mice from cardiovascular disease by endowing them with genes for high density lipoproteins , or HDL , the " good " cholesterol that has long been suspected of reducing the buildup of fatty tissue in the arteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transgenics that reliably develop cancers , and researchers in California have created mice carrying the gene for beta-amyloid protein , the principal component of the plaques riddling the brains of people with Alzheimer 's . The mice have since developed the brain deposits that characterize the degenerative disorder . <p> Genetic surprise . Transgenics have proved to be such powerful tools in part because they often reveal genetic surprises . Rudolf Jaenisch of the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge , Mass. , unexpectedly discovered that mice can live without a certain class of molecules that are considered crucial to the immune system 's ability to differentiate between the body 's own cells and invading viruses and bacteria . Jaenisch used homologous recombination to eliminate the gene for the molecule . Most researchers had assumed that without it , the mice would either die before birth or be prone to deadly infection . But to Jaenisch 's astonishment , the mice are healthy . In fact , they are now being used to study the role these molecules play in transplant rejection and infection . Such is serendipity in the lives of mice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brinster with a normal mouse ( right ) and one genetically engineered for obesity ( Linda L. Creighton-USN &WR); <p> By Charlene Crabb <p> FOLLOWING THE BLUEPRINT OF A DEADLY INHERITED DISEASE Cystic fibrosis <p> Scientists are identifying genes at the rate of one a day , but such feats represent only the first step on the long road to cures . Cystic fibrosis is a clear example . The 1989 discovery of the gene that causes CF garnered headlines and buoyed the hopes of families beset by the deadly inherited disease . But the gene merely provided the game plan to the search for a cure . After the initial excitement , scientists settled down to the less glamorous tasks that follow : defining its precise makeup , figuring out what protein it makes and what that protein does . <p> Within a year of the discovery , several labs had nailed down the molecules involved in the disease . The blueprint  --  the gene  --  told researchers precisely what the protein it manufactures must look like , and with that knowledge they tracked it to the surface of lung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CFTR , plays a key role in pumping water into and out of lung cells . The abnormal form of CFTR , which is created by a gene missing just three rungs on a molecular ladder a quarter of a million rungs long , ca n't move water around . Without that water , the lung 's mucus lining thickens into a dense , sticky haven for bacteria , resulting in recurring lung infections and early death . <p> Living " pharmacies . " Planting the protein in lung cell membranes is one way to set things right , but to do that scientists need enough protein to work with . In October , researchers from Genzyme Corp . in Framingham , Mass. , reported that they had loaded up mice , called transgenics , with healthy CFTR genes and that the mice were producing the protein in their milk . Such living " pharmacies " may supply healthy proteins to treat CF in the future . <p> Unlike protein delivery , gene therapy would provide a more lasting fix . Ronald Crystal of the National Heart , Lung and Blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has successfully ferried the gene into human cells in culture and into lung cells of living animals . " If nature is kind to us and we can get government approval , I think it will be feasible to try it in man in two years , ' he says . <p> But while the discovery of the gene has opened up a broad avenue of research , it has also brought on a dilemma common to genetics : whether to test people to see if they have a defective gene . About 12 million Americans carry a single faulty CFTR gene . They wo n't know it until two of them have a child who inherits a defective gene from each parent  --  or unless their genes are tested . But since some relatively rare types of cystic fibrosis have yet to be defined , the test can identify only about 85 percent of the carriers . Because of the imprecision , last year the government recommended holding off on widespread screening . <p> Preventive strategies .

Moving even further back in the chain of life , Yury Verlinsky of Illinois Masonic Medical Center tested an unfertilized egg from a CF carrier and determined that it did not hold the faulty gene . He reinserted it in the woman , and the resulting fetus was CF-free . <p> While the road from gene to cure is often bumpy and winding , in this case progress has been rapid . Two years after the gene 's discovery , researchers are " years , not decades " away from a cure , according to Cystic Fibrosis Foundation medical director Robert Beall . That will be none too soon for the 30,000 people in the United States with CF and for the parents who pray every day that something will happen before their child runs out of breath . <p> Picture : Awaiting cure .
