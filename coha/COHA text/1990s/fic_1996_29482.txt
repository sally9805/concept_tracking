Chapter One Early winter , 1984 More snow . Another Christmas season . Almost a year after Phillip 's death-or as some would have it , his murder . I sat back in the yellow cab as it bounced and plowed through the slush-filled New York streets . I was trying to put my mind in a calm place , but it would n't be still for me . I had promised myself I would n't be afraid-but I was very afraid . Outside the streaked , wet taxi window , even the Salvation Army Santa Clauses looked miserable . Nobody sane or sensible was out walking today ; those who were would not take their hands from their pockets to make a donation . The traffic cops looked like abandoned snowmen . The pigeons had disappeared from every windowsill and rooftop . I glanced at my own reflection in the cab 's window . Very long , blond hair , mostly with a mind of its own , but my best physical attribute , I thought . Freckles that no amount of makeup would ever cover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , I knew , regained at least some of their half-forgotten sparkle . A small mouth , thickish lips-made , as Phillip joked in the happy days , for fellatio . The thought of him made me shudder . The idea sex still makes me afraid , and much worse . It had been a year since the terrible shooting at Point . My recovery was slow , both physically and mentally , and it was n't complete . My leg still hurt , and brain did n't function with the clarity I 'd once taken pride in . I found myself frightened by small noises . I saw threats in nighttime streets when none existed . Previously in pretty good control of my feelings , I had lost that control . I would cry for no reason , grow angry a neighbor 's kindness , be suspicious of friends and afraid of strangers . There were times when I hated myself ! There had been an investigation , of course , but no trial . If Jennie had n't been so badly beaten , if it had been only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sent to prison that first time . But the fact that my three-year-old was injured too made our claim of self-defense more convincing . No prosecutor wanted to take on the case , and the military academy was only too happy to have it hushed up . Officers , it was a well-known fact , did not attack their wives and daughters . Wives and daughters really did n't exist at the Point . We were decorative . So I took flight , and traveled to New York City , where I rented a two-bedroom apartment . It was a second-floor walkup in a dreary brownstone on West Seventy-fifth Street I located a day school for Jennie . Our lives began to move at a slower pace . But I had n't found what I wanted most : an end to the pain , a beginning to a new life . I was twenty-five years old . I wore the letter M. I had taken someone 's life , even if it had been in self-defense . No guts , no glory , I urged myself on . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chasing a dream I 'd held on to and cherished for more than a dozen years . Perhaps today that new life would start . But was I doing the right thing ? Was I ready for this ? Or was I about to make a horribly embarrassing mistake ? I tightly held a briefcase in my lap , filled with songs I had written during the past year . Songs-the music and the words-were my way of exposing my pain and expressing my hopes for the future . Actually , I 'd been writing songs since I was ten or eleven . Mostly in my head , but sometimes on paper . The songs were the one thing that everybody seemed to like about me , the one thing I did well . Were they any good ? I thought maybe they were , but Jennie and a squirrel named Smooch were the only ones who had heard them , and , eager for praise as I was , I knew enough not to trust the opinion of a four-year-old , or a squirrel . Soon , though , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to audition the songs for Barry Kahn , the Barry Kahn , the singer-composer who had electrified America a decade ago and now was one of the most important record producers in the world . Barry Kahn wanted to hear my songs . Or so he said . ( Continues ... )
