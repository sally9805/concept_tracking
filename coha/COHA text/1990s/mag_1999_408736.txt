WHEN the Modern Library released its hst of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century , only three Black authors-Ralph Ellison , Richard Wright and James Baldwin-were cited . By their record , African-American male writers contributed little or nothing to the field of English letters and Black women authors made no impact at all . Contrary to this notion , Black creativity exploded during the 20th century . One need only look to the Harlem Renaissance , Black Arts Movement and even this decade of the ' ' 90s to become wowed by the scope of their work . In February of this year , we asked literary experts and our readers to help us compile our own list of the most influential books-novels , plays , autobiographies , historical works-by Black authors of this century .
