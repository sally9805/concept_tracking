<p> James A. Williams Jr . does n't look like a killer . He wears nice clothes , owns a $ 60,000 ranch house in the suburbs , raises three children and for most of the last 17 years , worked a steady job as a graphic arts designer . He does n't smoke , rarely drinks . He 's a provocative thinker who has the book " The Nature of Prejudice " on his nightstand . <p> The only giveaway is when he spreads his arms , revealing the faded tattoos of a rattlesnake on the underside of one arm and a heart on the other . <p> They seem like different men now , the reckless 21-year-old young man who gunned down the owner of a country store for $ 150 and the mature 54-year-old father who worries about bringing up his children as a single parent . <p> And for James Williams , his journey from one life to another is the story of human redemption , proof that a man can change , if given the opportunity , and become a productive member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the idea of rehabilitation , at least in the state of Virginia , where Gov . George Allen ( R ) wants to abolish parole and keep prisoners like Williams behind bars until they are old and gray . <p> " They think everybody does it again , " Williams said . " They think everybody 's a recidivist . And that 's not true . ... I 've been great since I got out . I have n't thought like a criminal . I thank God I got another chance . But this man , he does n't want to give people like me another chance . " <p> Everyone has heard the horror stories . Everyone can remember the case of the parolee who got out but raped and pillaged again . <p> What the public and the lawmakers who will convene in Richmond for a special crime-and-punishment session today rarely hear are the success stories , the ones who get out and do n't do it again . <p> " It 's a myth that everybody fails , " said Pleasant C. Shields , who was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman in Virginia for more than 35 years . " By far the majority of people released are successful . The public has never understood parole . In fact , the legislature does n't understand parole either . " <p> According to state figures , 9 percent of robberies , 4 percent of murders and 2 percent of rapes and aggravated assaults in Virginia are committed by criminals who still are under supervision after an early release on a Parole Board vote . Fewer than one-third of paroled rapists , robbers and murderers are convicted of another violent felony within five years . <p> The rest are people like Williams or Peter Green or Eric Penn , who have paid their price and want to move on . <p> " I 've learned that prison is not a place I want to be at , " said Green , 30 , who was a self-described " enforcer " for a prostitution ring and now works as a cook and a mechanic . " I have two jobs . I have a nice apartment . I have a car . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong people . I 'm doing everything I 'm supposed to . " <p> Penn , 29 , who was convicted of robbery and manslaughter after a botched mugging resulted in his shooting his partner to death during a struggle with their intended victims , voluntarily spent more than half of his 8 1/2 years in prison in solitary confinement to reflect on his life . <p> Two years after being released , he has a job delivering furniture , a new wife , two children and a new attitude on life . <p> " My mind is totally different , " he said . " I act differently . I think differently . I associate with different people . I even walk differently . " <p> Allen says he has no interest in the cases where parole has worked . Although there might be some isolated successes , in the governor 's view , there are far too many failures that have cost society far too much . <p> " For the violent repeat offender in particular , we simply were not willing to take that chance , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plan . " If we err , we want to err on the side of public safety . ... Even if somebody is rehabilitated after committing his second murder , the punishment need must still be answered . That repeat violent offender deserves to complete his sentence . " <p> " As long as the sentence is fair and reflects the severity of the crime , " he said , " I offer no apologies . " <p> The parole system bears no resemblance to the Hollywood stereotype . Prisoners are not trooped in front of an imperious-looking Parole Board and given a chance to plead their case . <p> In fact , the five members of the Virginia Parole Board never meet the people whose fates they govern or gather as a group to decide cases . Instead , each sits behind a desk in separate offices all day , scrolling through file after file on a computer screen , anonymously delivering judgments , sometimes in a matter of minutes . <p> The only time the human factor enters the equation is when relatives of a victim or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board member is assigned to meet with them briefly . <p> " With the sheer numbers , five members of the Parole Board ca n't do it the old-fashioned way , " board Chairman John B. Metzger III said . " It may lose the one-on-one factor , but I believe the would-be parolee gets a better , fairer , more accurate and more thoughtful assessment than if he had a meeting before Parole Board members . " <p> In Virginia , there are two types of parole . Under mandatory parole , an inmate automatically is released six months before his sentence ends so the state can maintain some supervision over him for half a year . <p> Discretionary parole is the more commonly understood system , in which inmates are reviewed by the board once a year and released if deemed worthy . <p> In the year that ended June 30 , the state released 4,153 prisoners on discretionary parole , with fewer than 10 percent of them being violent offenders . <p> Under the Allen plan , that system would be junked . Although the new rules would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would continue to render judgments in their cases  --  anyone convicted of crimes committed after Jan. 1 would face a whole new ballgame . <p> Sentences issued by judges would resemble more closely what actually would be served . Without parole , convicts would be allowed to shave off no more than 15 percent of their terms through good behavior . <p> Although nonviolent criminals would end up serving about the same amount of time as they now do , sentences would be ratcheted up dramatically for violent offenders . For a first conviction , a violent offender would spend twice as long behind bars as he now does , and for repeat violent offenders , the term would be three to seven times as long . <p> The only aspect of parole that would be kept under Allen 's plan is the practice of supervising prisoners for six months to three years after they are released , so if they violate certain conditions , they can be returned to jail immediately . <p> In a reflective moment , Williams will admit that the temptation of slipping back into a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an easy thing to handle 32 years after he crept up behind a store owner he once worked for in Hyacinth , Va. , tried to grab the fishing tackle box containing the day 's receipts and wound up killing the man in a struggle . He was given a life sentence but served 14 1/2 years . <p> " Sometimes I think about robbery . Sometimes I think about picking up a gun , but I think no , " he said . " God knows and has blessed me . I 'm strong enough . I 'm a man who learned from a mistake . I 'm not going that route . " <p> That has n't been always easy . In the 17 years since being released , Williams generally has stayed out of trouble . But he spent a couple weeks in jail earlier this year after shoving his estranged wife in a fight ; shortly thereafter , he lost his job and is now is looking for work . <p> In prison on the murder charge , he spent most of his time trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pored through an entire encyclopedia , received a general equivalency diploma and college degree and challenged other inmates to games of Scrabble  --  all while waiting for that day he might earn parole . <p> Without that incentive , he and other ex-convicts said , prisons will become riots waiting to happen . <p> " When you dim a convicted man 's hope and he 's walking around a fortress and going back into a 4-by-8 cell , he becomes a barbarian , " Williams said . " He becomes incorrigible , he becomes unmanageable . ... Guards 's lives are going to be in danger . ... That place , it 's going to come out of control so fast it 's going to be an Attica . " <p> " Something terrible is going to happen in Virginia , " said Alvin Lewis , 43 , a three-time felon released two years ago after serving time on drug-related convictions . " You can believe that . Allen has already lit the fuse . " <p> Nobody knows better how dangerous the men behind bars can be than those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this month in Richmond suggested they knew many inmates who should never be let out . <p> And yet , among black parolees , many can not help but see Allen 's plan as racist , in effect if not intent , given that two-thirds of the prison population is black . <p> " It 's a racist plot , " said Albert Jeter , 43 , who is black and is a repeat offender convicted of a variety of drug and larceny charges who is now working in a cabinet shop . " It 's got to be , because the criminal justice system has never treated us fair . " <p> According to former inmates and those who work with them , the biggest cause of recidivism is n't early release but the abrupt transition back to society . <p> Upon their release , convicts receive $ 25 and a bus ticket at the prison gates . Many wind up back in the same drug-ridden neighborhoods that got them in trouble . <p> The ones who avoid that trap are often those who have support , whether from family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started in Richmond 1 1/2 years ago by George Johnson has seen only two of its 125 members commit a new crime . <p> " When you do n't have any kind of preparation , many men and women are n't strong enough to do it on their own , " said Johnson , who taught history to Virginia inmates for years . <p> In talking to those released recently , he said , " we asked what was the biggest problem they faced when they came out . What kept coming up was the word fear , fear , fear . "
