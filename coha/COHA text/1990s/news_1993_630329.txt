<p> C ountry radio is at the crossroads . <p> Never have country airwaves been so enticing to young artists , audience and advertisers . New , younger listeners are being drawn in , while older listeners remain . Country radio may be the only format that is a family affair , making pertinent programming a challenge . <p> All-country " US 99 , " WUSN-FM ( 99.5 ) , is No. 1 in the 25-54 age group in Chicago , attracting an audience of more than 1 million people . And the listeners are evenly distributed through 10-year age brackets . <p> Lots of people are riding the country wave . <p> " Every radio station has a core audience , who listen two to three hours a day , " said J.D. Spangler , co-morning host and general program manager at US 99 . " You have to be true to your core . You do n't necessarily spread your spectrum wider to become more popular . " <p> Through research , Spangler knows that at least half of the station 's listeners were not country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station wondering when Patsy Cline was coming to town . <p> It 's impossible to act on that request , since Cline perished in a 1963 plane crash . But these are the more down-to-earth challenges for country radio in the 1990s : How to foster a relationship with older artists <p> George Jones has become the cause celebre for this issue . In accepting the Academy of Country Music 's Pioneer Award this spring , Jones said , " I wish that radio would pay a little moreattention to us older artists . We 're not dead yet . " <p> Jones still sounded angry last week in an interview from Nashville . " Things have n't changed , " he said . " Much of radio has the idea labels do n't sign anybody anymore unless they have a black hat on , they 're 20 years old , and they look real cute on television . " <p> At US 99 , older artists such as Merle Haggard are featured on Nancy Turner 's " Flashback Show , " from 8 to 9 a.m . Sundays . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing one classic country song per hour in regular rotation . The crossover dilemma <p> One of the best country songs of the year is " The Grand Tour , " a 1974 heartbreak hit for Jones that has been released as a country single by Aaron Neville . The soulful singer is dropping in on country stations during the current Neville Brothers tour , but is being met with resistance from programmers . <p> " People are skeptical , " Spangler said . " Does he really want to become a country singer ? We know Aaron Neville is a very talented guy , but we went through the same thing with Elvis Costello ( ' Almost Blue , ' his 1981 album of country standards ) . " <p> The skeptics may forget that Ray Charles has had successful careers in country and rhythm and blues . It can be done . Are traditional ears open to progressive country ? <p> There 's a brilliant stable of new or alternative country artists such as Jimmie Dale Gilmore , Iris DeMent , Kevin Welch and Kelly Willis who are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its horizons several ways . In Southern and South Central regions where country flourishes , there are now offshoot formats such as mainstream country ; " classic country , " which only features older artists , and " young country , " where the maximum shelf life of an artist is 18 months , kind of like the heavy-metal station " The Blaze " for cowboys . <p> This is a far cry from the 1960s , before radio programming became fragmented . Johnny Cash 's " Ring of Fire " and Skeeter Davis ' " End of the World " were pop hits , while the Beatles were covering country 's Carl Perkins . <p> US 99 is the only country radio station in Chicago , although WCCQ-FM ( 98.3 ) broadcasts country music out of Joliet . Last week , US 99 was nominated by the Country Music Association as large market " Station of the Year . " <p> US 99 is considered mainstream country . Artists in regular rotation include Wynonna Judd , Brooks and Dunn , Alan Jackson , McBride and the Ride and Garth Brooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , ' That does n't sound country to me , ' " Spangler said . " Everyone has their own definition . Our definition is what the majority of listeners tell us . We do constant research . If they tell us they do n't like a certain song , we do n't play it . And according to what our listeners are saying , Merle Haggard is not a mainstream country act anymore . " Keeping the talent pool fresh <p> Many country performers have backgrounds in other types of music . Emmylou Harris , Michael Martin Murphey and Mary-Chapin Carpenter started out as rock ' n ' rollers or folkies before jumping on the country bandwagon . <p> Carpenter , the CMA 's female vocalist of the year two years running , successfully crossed over into country from her progressive folk roots . She admits to not listening to country radio . <p> " When I 'm in my car , I invariably have it tuned to public radio because there are great bluegrass programs and more obscure things I can hear , " Carpenter said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All in all , the whole nature of radio is that it 's a tail wagged by advertising . They 've got a target . Demographics are real important . <p> " It 's so little about music in the end . " <p> Spangler , a Billboard magazine nominee for program director of the year , agreed with Carpenter . Spangler repeatedly professed his love for artists such as Jones , Haggard , Neville , Steve Earle and k.d. lang . None are played regularly on his station . <p> " Remember , when George Jones came up , he bumped somebody else out , " said Spangler , who is 42 . " It may have been Tommy Overstreet or Moe Bandy . ( From as recently as 1983 , only three of the Top 60 country artists are being played frequently today : Alabama , George Strait and McEntire . ) To still get airplay on a station that evolves is difficult . Hey , this is a business . We have to have a ton of listeners between the ages of 25 and 54 . The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to make money on their investment . " <p> Since last summer , US 99 has attained back-to-back No. 1 ratings , in the winter and spring of 1993 . The station is at the high point of its 11-year history . <p> All segments of the industry seem to agree on one thing : the high quality of country songs . Country radio once was an artist-driven medium . Today , emphasis is on the song . <p> Sheila Shipley , senior vice president for national country promotion at MCA Records , wrote an open letter to the country music community on June 1 on behalf of Jones . She urged that the industry maintain an open mind about older artists . <p> " If you were a superstar in the late ' 70s and early ' 80s , radio felt they had to play you because of your name , " Shipley said . " And the music industry was not putting out great material all the time . Some of the artists got a little passive . <p> " What started to make the turn in radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some great songs , and that 's how these new acts started to break . As they were making room for these new artists , yeah , it squeezed certain people out . I 'm not saying that 's wrong . You have to cut the best songs you can . " <p> Jones said his next album is full of " great " songs . His previous release , " Walls Can Fall , " directly confronted the issue of older artists in country radio , especially with the Billy Yates-Bruce Bouton-Frank Dycus title track and another hit from them , " I Do n't Need Your Rockin ' Chair . " Jones said , " I love the songs they find for me - not that it does me a lot of good on radio . I have to promote the record through videos . " <p> For the last word , the country community can turn to veteran songwriter Harlan Howard , who last month was nominated to the Country Music Hall of Fame . Howard , 63 , wrote the Patsy Cline hit " I Fall to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Think I 've Got a Heartache ) , " and the Ray Charles hit " Busted . " He has seen trends come and go . <p> " There are better songs coming out of Nashville , " Howard said . " There was a time when we faltered . Think about all these labels . Each of them has 30 acts putting out an album a year times 10 songs - that 's a fiery furnace . <p> " No doubt there is a youth movement going on , but I do n't care if it 's Garth Brooks or Mark Chesnutt , whoever is doing the best songs of the moment will be the hottest . They 're all basically handsome and young . <p> " But everything else being equal , radio boils down to the song . " <p> And country is no longer a song sung blue . <p> Color it green .
