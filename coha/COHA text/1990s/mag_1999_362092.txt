In the very first feature spread of the very first issue of her new magazine , Talk , editor Tina Brown 's formula of mixing high culture and low comes into view like a pop in the nose . It 's a haute-fashion shoot at a real Las Vegas boxing match , with a model , dressed by Helmut Lang , cavorting with Tony Curtis and George Foreman . On the cover , Hillary Clinton looks heavenward as if invoking divine guidance for her husband 's " sin of weakness , " Gwyneth Paltrow crawls on a leopard-print rug , and George W. Bush looks as if he 's about to cut loose with some earthy language ( as he does inside ) . The juice is in the juxtaposition , says Brown , as she lovingly leafs through her 254-page creation in her office 56 floors above Carnegie Hall . " I wanted to race up and down that high-low keyboard , " she says . <P> It 's an impressive riff , but is it a tune for today ? Brown is coming out with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time when publishing is gaga for websites and niches . Yet if anyone could dust off the genre , it 's probably Brown , one of America 's most successful magazine editors  --  if you 're measuring in buzz rather than bucks . She 's the one who put the glitz into Vanity Fair and the news into the New Yorker . When an editor who 's won an astonishing 14 National Magazine Awards decides to cook from scratch , expectations fly over the moon . Part of it was her own fault , teaming up as she did with financial backers Harvey and Bob Weinstein of Disney 's Miramax studios and proclaiming that her brainchild would be a " cultural search engine " that would spin off News ! Books ! Movies ! And did she forget theme-park rides ? <P> If all this helium were n't enough , Brown had the good fortune to be evicted from her preferred launch-party site by New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani when he learned that Hillary , his Senate rival , would be on Talk 's cover ( and not because party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of condoms featuring the Talk logo ) . Undaunted , Brown went higher in the pantheon of landmarks and nailed down the Statue of Liberty . The buzz intensified when a prepublication parody on the Internet swept through the chattering classes , promising pieces about " celebrities who have died but still sleep with other celebrities , " along with " Banter ! Emotion ! Solipsism ! Pretension ! Cold fusion and Krispy Kremes ! " <P> In the midst of all these exclamation points , the correct attitude was to be sick of it already without having seen it . But Brown has created something that shouts READ ME , if only because it 's much more raw and immediate than anything else on the stands with such an arty sheen and mainstream aspirations . She 's foraged for voices outside the media hothouse and let them vent as if they were at a dinner party ( or logged on to e-mail ) . Physically , the magazine owes its effect to European large-format glossies like Paris-Match and Stern . A run through its pages is like watching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superficial ; a centerfold of short bites about the Best Talkers up against a long essay on the joys of country life by a Manhattan denizen . It 's Sesame Street for adults , designed to be read at an espresso bar .
