LAS LISAS IS A DINKY , DROWSY TOWN IN the Dominican Republic , much like others that dot the small Caribbean country 's northern coast . Chickens run in the one paved street ; pigs root near the pink and green huts . At a roadside stand , a caldron of soup sits outside the door . A few men while away the afternoon hours playing dominoes in the shade of a nut tree . <P> But nothing in this Potemkin village is as it seems . Las Lisas traffics not in local cuisine or local color but in a dream  --  the dream of traveling to America . The food hut is actually a check-in station for refugees and their machete-strapped buscones ( guides ) . The men under the nut tree are lookouts , who meet groups of would-be immigrants arriving from Santo Domingo and direct them to hiding places in safe houses and the surrounding jungle . Makeshift boats  --  weighted down by rocks and submerged in the stream near town  --  are waiting to take the travelers to the U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City . Even the chickens have a role in this secret commerce : three times a day a boy delivers slaughtered birds and boxes of white rice to the refugees , who may wait days or weeks for their boat to leave . For a few pesos extra , he will bring a bottle of Brugal , the local rum , to kill the boredom and dull any fears about the dangers that lie ahead . " The town depends on the trips , " says an older resident . " When the weather is bad or the police ask for more money and the trips slow down , it becomes like a graveyard . " <P> Increasingly , when people want to go to America  --  illegally , that is  --  the Dominican Republic is where they go first . There are dozens of coastal towns just like Las Lisas where the chief industry  --  sometimes the sole industry  --  is illegal immigration . It is impossible to say exactly how many thousands of people arrive in the U.S. through the Dominican Republic each year , because official surveillance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other law-enforcement agencies made 4,364 arrests in the area last year , but that figure bears little relation to the number of people flooding out . <P> What is clear is that the illegal traffic is growing , and it is international , with refugees arriving on this remote stretch of beach from Latin America , Eastern Europe , the Middle East , even China and Japan . One telltale sign of the booming refugee trade : the Dominican Republic has become the largest importer of outboard engines in Latin America . Says a U.S. official : " There are boats every day taking people from all over the world into the U.S. through here . " <P> Now that beefed-up law enforcement has made it harder for illegal immigrants to cross the U.S.-Mexican border , the flow has shifted to this point of less resistance . The Dominican Republic 's seven busy international airports and minimal visa restrictions make it difficult to monitor the comings and goings of foreigners . And once refugees weather the 110-mile boat trip from the northern coast of the Dominican Republic to Puerto Rico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a document check .
