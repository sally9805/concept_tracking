In the two months since David 's sudden death , Lynne has stopped eating , started wearing nothing but black , and found herself a therapist in the Yellow Pages . She has never had much faith in therapy  --  all that high-priced crying over spilt milk  --  but she felt she had no choice : she is afraid that if she does n't talk to someone about David , she will go crazy and wind up in a mental hospital , shuffling around in bedroom slippers , zombied out on lithium , weaving potholders , while her six-year-old son , Kyle , gets shunted from one abusive foster home to the next . As a lapsed Catholic , she knows that you pay for your sins , and she is paying ninety dollars an hour , which she can ill afford , in order to talk to someone , someone who has sworn a professional oath of confidentiality , about her clandestine affair with a married man who was about to leave his wife for her when he suddenly dropped dead of a heart attack , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Rockville , California , is a small town populated by people with big mouths  --  sometimes she ca n't believe what intimate details she has learned , through the grapevine , about some people with whom she has barely exchanged two words  --  and she feels that she owes it to David to keep their secret . Even if it bankrupts and kills her . Which she thinks it might . The only thing more painful than grief , she has discovered , is hidden grief . She feels like a closed coffin . Every night she cries herself to sleep , muffling her mouth with a pillow so that her son , in the next room , wo n't hear her . Frequently , after she has cried herself out , she takes her sodden pillow and crawls into bed with Kyle , finding some comfort in his warm , restless little body . If it were n't for Kyle  --  feeding him his Cheerios every morning and giving him his bath every evening , the daily rituals of care and maintenance  --  she might have killed herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her own age named Eleanor , tries to steer the talk back to Lynne 's parents  --  doing her therapist thing  --  Lynne returns politely but firmly to the topic of David . She figures that she can talk to anyone , any time , for nothing , about her parents , but she can talk only to Eleanor about David . She is paying Eleanor to listen to her talk about David , about the intimate details of their private relationship , the way a girlfriend would under other circumstances . She thinks of Eleanor as a sort of overpaid , overqualified girlfriend . <p> A lot of the younger , hipper doctors in town have offices in renovated Victorians in the small downtown area , and Eleanor 's office happens to be just one block from the building in which David 's wife , David 's widow  --  the very word gives Lynne the chills  --  has her office . Fortunately , Rockville Realty , where Lynne works , is located two blocks in the opposite direction , so that when she walks from work to her therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , in the five weeks she has been coming to Eleanor 's office on Thursday afternoons , she has never once so much as glimpsed the back of Rachel 's head , or even her car , a cantaloupe-colored Karmann Ghia . Even so , ever time she leaves or enters Eleanor 's office , she can not help glancing in the direction of Rachel 's building , half hoping and half dreading that she will see her . <p> So it came as a complete , heart-pounding shock to turn the corner at the Alpha Beta supermarket this noon , shopping for a few essentials on her lunch hour , and nearly ram Rachel with her cart . They greeted each other like long-lost friends  --  Lynne had sold David and Rachel their house when they moved to Rockville from the city about this time last year  --  and Lynne somehow managed to mumble her condolences , which she could n't very well not do under the circumstances . Rachel thanked her , and Lynne glanced at her watch and gasped , as if she were late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getaway when Rachel suddenly reached out and rested a hand on Lynne 's forearm and said , " This is actually a stroke of luck . I was going to call you later today anyway . " She paused to sigh and rearrange the few items in her cart . Lynne noted that all the items in Rachel 's cart were sophisticated and adult  --  yogurt , Brie , a jar of olives , chutney , something leafy that could be cilantro or maybe watercress  --  while her own cart contained peanut butter , apple juice , Teddy Grahams , and Popsicles . They were standing by the freezer case , and Lynne felt a paralyzing stab of pain as Rachel opened the glass door and casually tossed a pint of ice cream into her cart which Lynne recognized as David 's favorite : Haagen-Dazs Vanilla Swiss Almond . It was her favorite , too , but she had not been able to touch the stuff since his death . <p> " I need to put the house on the market , " Rachel said as she slammed the freezer door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She let the sentence trail off . <p> Lynne nodded sympathetically , at a total loss for words . Finally she looked at her watch again and managed to stutter something to the effect that she would give Rachel a call later that evening . <p> " Do you have the number ? " Rachel called after her as she hurried down the aisle . Lynne turned and said , " I must have it at the office , " feeling the color rise to her cheeks as she thought of all the times she had called David at home while Rachel was at work and how indelibly the number was imprinted on her brain . She imagined that she would be able to summon it from the recesses of her memory on her deathbed even if she lived to be a hundred and suffered from Alzheimer 's . At the check-out counter Lynne 's hands trembled so violently that she had difficulty writing a check , and she grabbed her bag and fled to her parked car and drove directly to a pay phone and called Eleanor and begged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour later , she is sitting across from Eleanor , crying into a tissue , recounting blow by blow the unsettling encounter in the supermarket , when she should be out showing the McNairs ' split-level on Sunnyslope Road to the Shimonos , when she should be out trying to make money instead of spending a dollar and a half a minute talking to a woman who merely nods her head a lot and who Lynne increasingly suspects is gay and therefore , despite all her advanced degrees , probably understands what Lynne is going through , has been through , no better than your average woman on the street . <p> " I do n't believe this . It 's so incredibly ironic . " Lynne blows her nose and attempts a little laugh . " She actually wants me to sell their house . " She shakes her head in disbelief . <p> When Lynne pauses to allow Eleanor to say something appropriately psychological , there is a long , loud silence . Lynne hates silences like this ; they make her feel as if she is paying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell her no , " Lynne says anxiously when she realizes that Eleanor is not going to comment . " I 'll make up some excuse . " <p> Eleanor nods . Most of her nods seem noncommittal , as in " I see , " but this nod seems to convey a note of approval , as in " Good girl , " and Lynne immediately feels relieved , like a conscientious student who has divined the right answer . She knows that Eleanor thinks she needs to put David behind her and get on with her life . She suspects that although Eleanor pretends to be sympathetic , she really thinks that David was just another chauvinist schmuck , untrustworthy to the max , who would have broken her heart one way or the other , sooner or later , alive or dead , and that she should consider herself well rid of him . <p> " Okay , then , " Lynne says , " that 's what I 'll do . I 'll call her tonight and tell her . I 'll say I 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She looks slyly at Eleanor , who laughs on cue . Dwayne is a pathetic macho desperado who wears pointy cowboy boots and one of those Texas string ties with a Lucite clasp that has a dead scorpion trapped inside , and who is always coming on to her , making suggestive comments and brushing up against her in the office . <p> Eleanor looks pointedly at the little clock on the table beside her , and Lynne obediently pops up out of her chair and says politely , " I appreciate your taking me on such short notice . " <p> " No problem , " Eleanor says . " See you Thursday . " Then , as she does at the end of every session , she cradles Lynne 's hand in both of hers for a moment , as if to pump sanity into her . Even though it 's a bit awkward , Lynne always finds the gesture oddly comforting , and feels a pang when Eleanor lets go . <p> After David dropped dead , she found herself going to the beauty parlor every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel of someone 's fingers against her skin . She would call a different salon each time and tell them the same lie  --  she was having her bathroom remodeled , and needed to get her hair washed . Her waist-length coppery hair was her glory . Sometimes after they made love , when her hair was all tangled up , David would sit in bed and patiently , gently brush the snarls away . Once she started therapy , though , she had to economize and cut out the beauty-parlor visits . A couple of times she tried bribing Kyle to brush her hair , but he got bored and restless , and she was afraid that maybe she would warp him sexually in some way , so she abandoned that idea . Then , for the first time in her life , she started experiencing keen urges to get her hair cut off . It seemed fittingly symbolic , like cutting your losses . Once , on the one-month anniversary of David 's death , Lynne called the beauty parlor she liked best and made an appointment , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , but I 'm not ready , " she told the baffled receptionist . " It 's just too soon . " <p> The Shimonos , usually very punctual , are late showing up at the split-level on Sunnyslope . Mr. Shimono , some sort of computer genius , apologizes gravely : " We lose ourselves on the way . " As a result , Lynne is late getting to the elementary school and Kyle is sitting glumly alone in the fenced-in playground , waiting for her , when she pulls up . Under optimal conditions he is not a child with a sunny disposition , and now he glowers in the seat next to her , maniacally punching the radio buttons , daring her to tell him to knock it off . From the moment he was born he has had a way of making her feel inadequate and apologetic , just as his father always had . And as with his father , she feels closest to him in bed . She enjoys the bedtime ritual of crawling under the covers and reading him a book or telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long dark eyelashes start to droop and she can cautiously extract herself and tiptoe out of the room . <p> When Kyle was just a year old , his father , Charlie , left her to move back in with his widowed mother , who had always doted on him . He left a note for Lynne detailing his reasons for this decision in perfect outline form , complete with roman numerals and capital letters , major headings and subheadings . He was a hydroelectrical engineer . The bottom line was that he preferred being a child to being a father . His mother died a year later , and he called Lynne to see whether she was interested in a reconciliation ; when she told him to forget it , he accepted a transfer to Nigeria , where he has lived for the past four years , unmarried , with two servants to wait on him hand and foot . Lynne finds it absolutely incredible that Kyle , who has spent so little time with Charlie , has somehow learned to duplicate all his absent father 's idiosyncratic expressions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her genes aside just as he always pushed her needs aside in everyday life . It seems unfair . She is the one who has taken care of Kyle day in and day out  --  hauled herself out of bed when he had nightmares or a stomach ache , wiped his stinky little butt , cooked his meals , entertained him when she was dead tired  --  and yet her son , the flesh of her flesh , is not the least bit like her . Physically , intellectually , emotionally , he is his father 's son . In fact , she would not be at all surprised to come home someday in the not so distant future and find Kyle 's closet empty and a note for her on the kitchen table . Dear Mom , he would print neatly , This just is n't working out . <p> In an attempt to placate Kyle she shouts over the radio , " I thought we could stop and pick up a pizza , " even though she has left some chicken breasts out to defrost . <p> " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being agreeable , but he reaches over and turns off the radio . <p> She puts her hand out and ruffles his silky hair , and her eyes blur with tears . For the ten months of her relationship with David , she kept picturing the three of them together as a family , doing family things  --  going on picnics , playing softball , camping , taking educational field trips to the city . She imagined David and Kyle assembling model airplanes or watching sports events on TV . David had always seemed willing and eager to take on the role of stepdad , assuring her that he considered Kyle a bonus , not a liability . He and Rachel wanted children , he had told her the first time they met for coffee alone , and had tried everything  --  all the state-of-the-art conception methods  --  but with no luck . He had looked so sad sitting there smiling across the table at her . She realized suddenly that he was a very good-looking man , as well as very kind and sensitive . She had liked his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their worst  --  buying a house was a stressful undertaking , and the women were generally impossible  --  but Rachel Bloch had always been pleasant , considerate , and reasonable . And although she was a hotshot child psychologist , she was never snobbish or superior with Lynne , who had a completely useless B.F.A . in painting in addition to a real-estate license . In spite of all this , at that moment  --  looking into David 's sad , kind eyes looking into her own eyes  --  she suddenly felt protective of him , as she would of a little boy who had been sent off to school with a scanty , unnourishing breakfast and a too-thin jacket on a cold day . And after that she found herself avoiding Rachel . <p> As they pull into the parking lot of the pizza parlor , Kyle blesses her with one of his rare sunburst smiles of approval and says , " This was a good idea , Mom . " Before she can respond , he ejects from his seat and races toward the front door . Trailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought that she should be glad that Kyle never got the chance to know David better . She and David usually got together during the daytime , when Rachel was at work and Kyle was at school . Fortunately , David was a free-lance writer who worked at home , and she had found she could easily juggle her own schedule . So on Tuesday , Wednesday , and Thursday mornings and occasionally on Monday and Friday afternoons , depending on Rachel 's client load , David would zip over to her apartment and they would spend a couple of hours in bed , making love and fantasizing about the future . The future . Lynne feels a hard lump lodge in her throat just as the clerk asks to take her order . She stands there mute , unable to utter a sound , until Kyle tugs impatiently on her shoulder bag . " Tell him we want a large sausage-and-mushroom , " he says authoritatively . The clerk looks at Lynne , who just nods and pulls out her wallet . <p> After they have eaten the pizza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynne has picked at hers  --  he takes off to ride his bike before bedtime , and Lynne sits in the breakfast nook and stares at the yellow wall phone , rehearsing what she is going to say . She feels sorry that Rachel has to sell the house , knowing how much work she put into restoring the place , but she also feels angry at Rachel for being so willing to relinquish this tangible shell of David 's life , even if he was planning to move out . Lynne knows that if she were in Rachel 's position , she would do whatever she needed to do to hang on to the house , at least for the time being . One of the things that she cries about late a night is that she has been left with so few physical remnants of David 's presence in her life . A pair of gym socks , a soft pack of Carltons with one crushed cigarette , a half-empty container of Vanilla Swiss Almond in the freezer , a purple gloxinia ( now dying ) and a gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes late at night , lying in bed , when she hears the deep , melodious chimes , she feels that he is speaking to her from some other realm . She spends a lot of time lying on the bed during the day trying to conjure up certain memorable moments of passion , but although she can remember the details vividly , the physical sensations themselves remain stubbornly elusive . Except occasionally in dreams , when she can actually feel the touch of his fingers on her breast or the rhythm of him moving inside her . <p> He had been dead for three days before she heard about it , and she had nearly gone crazy wondering what was going on with him . When he did n't show up at her place on Friday afternoon as planned , she called his house and got the answering machine . She did not call that weekend , because she knew Rachel might answer , and anyway , she was miffed and expected him to call her and apologize . But he did not call Monday morning , and her anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Rachel answered , she hung up . The fact that Rachel was not at the office only made Lynne more worried . She paced around her apartment for a while wondering what she could do , and then , out of desperation more than anything else , decided to call the racquet club , where she knew David went almost every day . A young girl answered and Lynne asked for David Bloch . The girl did n't say anything for a moment and then said , " Just a minute , please , " and a moment later an older man , obviously the boss , picked up the phone . And that 's how she heard . <p> She hears a scraping crash outside and rushes to the window , adrenaline pumping . Kyle is lying spread-eagled on top of his bike , on the scraggly , burnt front lawn . Thank God he 's not on the street , she thinks , as she rushes down the hallway and out the door . He is already sitting up , with his back to her , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks he must be okay , but when he turns around , blood is pouring from his mouth . O God , Oh my God , she screams inside , trying to remain outwardly calm , but when he sees her face he starts to scream as if he were dying . <p> When they are driving home from the emergency room , Kyle slumps in his seat , nearly asleep , doped up on a painkiller . A gauze bandage , like a little white beard , covers most of his chin . Two of his bottom teeth had gone through his lip . She had nearly fainted at the sight . The doctor , a stunning Indian woman who looked like an actress playing a doctor , gave him six stitches and complimented him on being such a brave boy . Kyle wanted to know if he would have a scar and seemed disappointed when the doctor assured him that any scar would be very , very faint . Lynne pulls into her parking space and peers at her watch in the dim light . It is after ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit under his limp weight , and manages to make it into his bedroom and set him down on his bed before collapsing . When she recovers her strength , she tugs off his sneakers and jeans , pulls the covers up over him , kisses him lightly on the forehead , flicks off the light , and tiptoes out of his room . God , she thinks , what next ? <p> The living room , like the rest of the apartment , is a wreck . Her twice-a-month cleaning service was sacrificed , along with the beauty parlor , to pay for her therapy appointments . She kicks a fleet of Kyle 's Matchbox cars into the corner , gathers up some old unread newspapers and dumps them into a basket under the coffee table , and sinks , exhausted , onto the couch . Every night after Kyle is in bed , Lynne lies on the couch , drinking and thinking . She feels terribly , terribly cheated , like a child who has waited patiently in line , not shoving or whining , only to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cookie . For months and months she was understanding and uncomplaining , waiting for David to extricate himself from his marriage . Although Rachel had always seemed to Lynne to be an unusually strong and confident woman , David assured her that , underneath , Rachel was a quivering puddle of insecurity and that her self-esteem , her sense of herself as a woman , had been severely undermined by her inability to conceive a child . If he left abruptly , he said , Rachel would be devastated . He had to proceed slowly and gently , he said , so that she would see that their basic incompatibility had nothing to do with her infertility  --  although he did concede that her single-minded obsession with conception had in fact cast a pall on the marriage . The fact that Lynne had a child , he said , would be like rubbing salt in the wound . She understood , did n't she ? And Lynne would nod and agree to wait just a little longer , until after Christmas or Rachel 's parents ' visit or David 's latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whine that she , too , had insecurities , huge , gnawing insecurities  --  in fact , she would bet that her insecurities could eat Rachel 's insecurities for lunch  --  and just how long did he intend to drag this thing out ? How did she know he was n't just stringing her along ? I mean , after all , she was the classic Other Woman , was n't she ? Just have faith , he would say , looking into her eyes . Trust me . <p> And despite herself , she did . Even though , as Eleanor continues to point out to her , she has no way of knowing that he actually would have left his wife , or that even if he had , their own relationship would have worked out , she knows . She knows he would have and it would have . And she does n't want anyone trying to reason her grief away by pointing out that she had no guarantees . Deep in her gut she knows that David loved her more than any other man ever has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . Yes , happy , she repeats to herself defiantly , as she pictures Eleanor 's dubious expression . <p> Lying on the couch , an empty bourbon glass loose in her hand , she nods off to sleep . She dreams that David and she are living in a playhouse in David 's back yard . Their playhouse is a perfect miniaturized version of the big Victorian house in which Rachel lives . During the day David and she sleep . Their bed is suspended by chains from the ceiling , like a large swing . At night she sneaks into the big house and steals whatever they need  --  food , clothing , books , records , pretty trinkets . As she tiptoes around the big house during these nightly forays , her heart pounds ; she is terrified . She knows that if Rachel is disturbed , in her terrible fiery wrath she  --  like a sleeping dragon suddenly roused from her long slumber  --  will reduce Lynne to a tiny , pitiful pile of ashes . This particular night , as Lynne is reaching for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she clumsily knocks a bottle of perfume onto the wood floor . She freezes in terror . And then she jolts wide awake , her heart hammering , her neck twisted at a painful angle , shivering slightly from the cold , and gets up and stumbles down the dark hallway and climbs into bed next to her warm , sleeping son . <p> But she can not fall back to sleep . It is a windy night , and she lies awake , hour after hour , listening to the wind chime in the back yard . And that 's when she decides that despite what she told Eleanor , she will call Rachel in the morning and agree to list the house . As soon as she makes this decision , she relaxes and feels herself drifting off again . It is as if she has known all along that she would say yes , that she could n't say no . <p> All the next morning , as she is going about her business , Lynne feels anxious and impatient , waiting for two o'clock , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David 's house . A closing at first Commercial Federal drags on and on , first the escrow officer is late , and then he drones on in an excruciatingly slow and meticulous manner , repeating everything . " In other words , " he says , and goes on to rephrase what he has just said , until Lynne has fantasies of reaching across the conference table and stuffing his loud , ugly tie in his mouth . When the closing finally ends , she has her weekly appointment to drive Marian Lawrence around , showing her two or three new listings . She happens to know , through the Rockville grapevine , that Marian has terminal cancer  --  breast cancer that has metastasized to her lungs  --  and is not expected to live long . But for some reason , ever since the recurrence of the cancer Marian has developed this passion for house-hunting . They never speak of Marian 's illness , have never even acknowledged it , and yet they have become quite close in a certain odd way . Even though Lynne knows that Marian is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resent the hours she has spent driving her around town , showing her through dozens of houses . She figures that somehow this weekly charade calms Marian and allows her to pretend for an hour or two that she has a future like everyone else . When David died , Marian was the first and only person Lynne considered calling , confiding in  --  not her sister , not her friends , just Marian . But in the end she decided against it . She knew that although Marian would be understanding and sympathetic , it would break the magic spell of their outings . And so , instead , she had plucked Eleanor 's name from the Yellow Pages . <p> Today , when Lynne drops her off at her daughter-in-law 's house , Marian sits for a moment , rummaging around in her handbag , and pulls out a small , beautifully wrapped gift . " I may not be able to come next week , " she says , not elaborating as people normally do . " And I wanted to give you a little something as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , protesting that Marian really should n't have , and then drives off quickly , afraid she might burst into tears , which would ruin everything . Lately she feels like a character in a soap opera , only not as well dressed . Since David died , she has not taken any interest in her appearance . Until this morning . Knowing that she was going to see Rachel , who always looks so exotic , Lynne stood in front of her full-length mirror discarding one sad , crummy-looking outfit after another , until Kyle complained that he was going to be late for school and dragged her out to the car . <p> " Do you like this dress " she asked him as they backed out of the carport . <p> " Very nice , " he said , sounding exactly like his father , engrossed in examining and critiquing the contents of his lunch box . <p> She took a hand off the steering wheel and reached over and covered his eyes . " What color is it ? " <p> " Pink . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He giggled and squirmed away and shouted , " Purple ! " <p> " You peeked , " she said . <p> " You forgot to put jelly on my sandwich . " He frowned down at the plastic-wrapped sandwich . <p> " We were out of jelly , " she said . " Sorry . " <p> He heaved a big sigh and snapped on the radio . <p> " Come on , it 's not the end of the world , " she said , turning down the volume . " Give me a break . " <p> " Maybe I 'll go live with Dad , " he said coolly , turning to look out the window . This was his new favorite ploy , which never failed to get her goat . <p> " Go ahead , " she snapped . " Be my guest . They probably do n't even have Welch 's grape jelly in Nigeria . " <p> She turned the volume on the radio back up and they ignored each other for the rest of the ride . When they pulled up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure he felt well enough to go today , after his big fall . " You can stay with Nana , you know , " she told him . <p> " I 'm okay , " he said , leaning away when she leaned over to kiss him . Then , just as he was getting out of the car , he surprised her by turning around and saying , " You look pretty . " <p> And for the first time in weeks she actually felt pretty . <p> But as soon as she turns the corner of D Street and sees Rachel 's jazzy Karmann Ghia parked in the driveway , her self-confidence deserts her . She knows this is a bad idea . Why put herself through this ? What can she possibly hope to gain by it ? As she gets out of her car and walks up the cobblestone path leading to the front door , she considers turning around and driving off , but just then , as luck would have it , a dog catches sight of her and starts barking , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls out a greeting , holding the rambunctious dog by his collar until Lynne is safely inside . <p> " This is Roscoe , " Rachel says , letting go of the setter 's collar . The dog makes a beeline for Lynne 's crotch , sniffing at her through her thin cotton dress . Blushing , Lynne tries to push him gently but firmly away . <p> " He 's still a puppy , " Rachel apologizes , dragging the dog away from Lynne . " David was going to take him to obedience school . " She sighs and motions for Lynne to take a seat on the sofa . <p> Shaken , Lynne sinks down into the black Italian-leather couch and holds her clipboard primly over the wet spot on her dress . David had always been inordinately fond of oral sex , more so than any of her half dozen previous lovers , and she keeps glancing nervously over at the dog as if somehow David 's spirit had taken hold of the animal . She dimly remembers reading about such things during her Carlos Castaneda period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some iced tea or a diet Coke ? " Rachel asks graciously . <p> " A diet Coke would be great , " Lynne says . <p> Rachel gets up and heads toward the kitchen , her armload of silver bracelets tinkling faintly . She is wearing black stretch capri pants like the ones Lynne 's mother used to wear , but somehow they look nothing like they looked on her mother . Her oversized black T-shirt and short , boyish haircut somehow manage to look ultra-feminine . Lynne suddenly feels like a leftover from Woodstock in her gauzy sundress and long straight hair . She looks over at the dog , who seems to be staring at her with a terrible yearning desire in his soft brown eyes  --  eyes that actually do remind her of David 's  --  and she remembers the sound of David 's voice telling her she is beautiful . You 're beautiful , he would say , so , so beautiful . Of course , usually she was naked when he said this , and it has never occurred to her until now to wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared . <p> The phone rings , and Lynne hears Rachel pick it up in the kitchen . While Rachel is talking , Lynne gets up and paces around the room . She has not been inside the house since shortly after Rachel and David moved in , when she stopped by to drop off a housewarming gift  --  a hibiscus bush , the same thing she gives to all her clients . She is both relieved and disappointed by how spare and impersonal the room seems to be . Just the usual thirtysomething decor  --  Persian rug , bookshelves , abstract paintings , glass coffee table , piano , two huge cacti , and a few exotic trinkets picked up on foreign junkets . No corny wedding photographs or vacation snapshots . She remembers David 's telling her that they were married on a sailboat . <p> Rachel hurries back into the living room with Lynne 's diet Coke in a beautiful hand-blown glass , apologizing for the delay . " That was David 's mother , " she sighs . " She 's driving me crazy . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would someday have been her own mother-in-law if David 's heart had not given out . Now she would never even meet her . To keep herself from sinking any deeper , she pulls out her pen and says , " Why do n't you show me all the improvements you 've made , and then I can go back to the office and come up with an asking price . " This was called a market-value analysis , a part of the job that Lynne usually enjoyed . <p> In an effort to keep emotionally detached , Lynne jots down lots of little notes as she follows Rachel from the living room to the dining room to the sun-room to the kitchen and out onto the newly laid patio . " Wow . You 've done wonders , " Lynne marvels appreciatively . " Everything 's perfect . " <p> " David loved this house , " Rachel says and sighs , sliding the glass door shut as they walk back inside . " I figured enough was enough , but he still had a million plans . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put down a wood floor . " <p> He was ? Lynne thinks . When ? She has always sort of assumed that Rachel must have suspected something was going on  --  not with Lynne specifically , but with someone . All that passion . How could she not sense something ? But she sees now that Rachel does not have a clue . They are walking up the stairs , Lynne trailing along silently , unnerved by the thought of seeing their bedroom , which she had spent so much time trying not to picture during all those nights she slept alone , waiting for him to leave , to be with her . <p> But first Rachel opens the door to a pleasant little guest room done in Laura Ashley prints . " Nice , " Lynne says . Next Rachel moves across the hall . " This was David 's study , " she says , opening the mini-blinds . In the sudden brightness Lynne 's glance pounces on a photograph of Rachel in a silver-filigree frame , sitting beside the computer . A glamorous head shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapshot of the two of them with their arms wrapped around each other on a travel-poster-looking beach . " He was planning to remodel the attic for his study eventually , " Rachel says , " but I always liked this room . Do n't you ? " <p> Lynne nods , feeling light-headed and confused . A couple of times when she had expressed alarm or doubt upon hearing about yet another major home-improvement project  --  asking him why he was willing to spend so much time and money on a place he would be moving out of soon  --  David had reassured her that the renovations were all Rachel 's pet projects , something he just went along with under duress . He said that the house was Rachel 's substitute baby . Lynne feels her palms start to sweat and her intestines knot up . When Rachel leads her into the remodeled bathroom , with its shiny black-porcelain and brass fixtures , she wants to slam the door shut and lock herself inside until the churning wave of nausea passes . She actually considers asking Rachel if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already ushering her out and down the hallway , with its tweedy industrial carpeting and track lighting , to the master bedroom . <p> " This was our room , " Rachel says , and for the first time Lynne hears the catch in her voice and sees the dazed , slack expression of pain in her eyes as they both stand there looking around the huge , empty-seeming room . Up until now Rachel has seemed to her to be extraordinarily cool and detached , hardly the picture of a grieving widow . For the first time Lynne feels a genuine stab of guilt . She almost acts on a sudden weird urge to reach out and take Rachel 's hand , but just then Rachel walks over and throws open a window . " It 's stuffy in here , " she says . " I 've been sleeping in the guest room ever since  --  " The sentence hangs in the air . <p> It is a beautiful room . Spare and Japanese . Tranquil . Tatami mats on the bleached-wood floor , a low king-size bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging over the bed . Lynne can not remember ever seeing a more inviting , soothing room . Looking at the pristine lacquered dresser top , she pictures her own bedroom , with its tacky floral wallpaper and dresser top cluttered with miscellaneous junk , and she imagines , painfully , that David must have felt a sense of peaceful relief upon returning home to this room . Despite himself . Even if he did really love her . She knew this was a bad idea . She wishes she had never seen this room . But then , turning slightly , she is suddenly surprised and gratified to notice a glaring eyesore . Pointing to a boarded-up rectangle on the ceiling , she says , " Does the roof leak ? " <p> " No . " Rachel shakes her head . " David was putting in a skylight . He was doing it himself . " She looks for a moment as if she might lose control ; then she gets a grip on herself and walks briskly out of the room , saying , " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skylight before you start bringing people through . " <p> Lynne thinks she might faint , but she forces herself to take deep breaths and to remain on her feet through an act of sheer will . Like the time she was holding Kyle , who was just a baby , and she accidentally slammed the car door on her fingers and the pain was so intense she thought she was going to pass out on the sidewalk , but through superhuman maternal instinct she managed somehow to reach over and open the car door and deposit the baby safely on the front seat before blacking out . <p> " Are you all right ? " Rachel asks her , turning back to look at her standing there alone in the room , staring up at the aborted skylight . Their eyes lock for a moment , and Lynne feels her pulse rev . She hovers on the edge of saying something , something to shock Rachel , something to release some of the anger she feels building inside her , anger that she now recognizes has been lurking there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even though she knows that none of this is Rachel 's fault  --  that Rachel is , in fact , the innocent party in all this  --  she wants to hurt her . <p> " We were in love , " she says . " We were having an affair . " Her voice sounds shrill but bold and defiant , too loud in the empty room . <p> Rachel stands there looking at her with a benign , puzzled expression on her face for an instant , and then it seems to hit her . Somewhere behind the eyes . Lynne braces herself , but instead of the fiery blast of wrath from her nightmare , Rachel just says , " I thought there was someone , " and turns her back on Lynne and starts down the stairs . <p> " He was going to leave you , " Lynne shouts at her back , too carried away now to stop herself , as if an internal dam had burst and she were being dragged downriver on a flood of emotion . She runs down the stairs after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " she says again , only this time , as she says it , she hears her voice waver and she knows that it is n't true , it never was true , and she bursts into a humiliating flood of tears . <p> Rachel disappears into the guest bathroom and reappears with a lacquered tissue dispenser . " I 'm glad you told me . " She hands Lynne a peach-colored tissue . " It explains a lot . And it took real courage on your part . " <p> Lynne stops blowing her nose and looks at Rachel , wondering if she is crazy . " It was n't courage , " Lynne mumbles , abruptly appalled and ashamed by what she 's done . <p> " Well , whatever . " Rachel shrugs . She walks over and opens the front door . <p> " I 'm sorry , " Lynne mumbles , not knowing what else she can say under the circumstances . From out of nowhere the dog suddenly skitters into the foyer and leaps on her , nearly knocking her over and snuffling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynne hurries outside , grateful for the diversion , and the door slams shut behind her . <p> In the car Lynne just sits for a few moments , resting her forehead against the steering wheel , trying to collect herself . Do n't think about it now , she tells herself . You 'll have plenty of time to think about it later . She fishes a crumpled , dingy tissue out of her purse and dabs at her eyes and yanks a brush quickly through her hair , attempting to look normal . Then she glances at her watch and heads over to Kyle 's school , relieved to see that she is not yet late ; in fact , she is early . As she sits by the curb waiting for school to let out , she thinks about walking across the street to the pay phone and calling Eleanor to ask for a special appointment . But somehow she does not really feel like talking to Eleanor . Not now , maybe not ever . She knows that Eleanor is a big believer in " the handwriting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that she is a complete illiterate when it comes to reading men . Still , she knows that he did love her . She knows that . Do n't tink about it now , she reminds herself sternly , as Kyle bursts through the door in a swarm of other kids laden with lunch boxes and construction-paper masterpieces . She waves at him and glances at herself in the rearview mirror . She does n't think she looks too bad , considering . But the minute Kyle climbs into the car , he looks at her suspiciously and says , " What 's wrong ? " <p> " Nothing . " She attempts a cheery , reassuring smile . " Just a tiring day . " She rummages in her purse and hands him a pack of Juicy Fruit . " How was your day ? Did your stitches hurt ? " <p> He shrugs and shakes his head , intent on unwrapping a stick of gum and cramming it into his mouth . " Let 's stop at Burger King , " he says , in between loud smacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired to argue , even though it is nowhere near dinner time and the defrosted chicken breasts from yesterday are just going to spoil . <p> " What happened to your dress ? " He points to the damp spot over her crotch . <p> " A big dog slobbered on it , " she says . <p> " Really ? " He finds this hilarious and snickers , on and off , the whole way to Burger King . His father 's sick sense of humor exactly . As they pull into the parking lot , Kyle reaches underneath him and waves Marian 's slightly squashed package under her nose . " What 's this ? " he asks . " Is it for me ? " <p> She shakes her head . " Sorry , Charlie . It 's just a little gift one of my clients gave me . " She takes it from him and drops it into her purse . <p> Inside , they sit in a bright-orange booth , eating silently . While Kyle chomps contentedly on his hamburger , Lynne nibbles away at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his loud , outraged protests . " Why do n't you order your own ? " he says , scowling , even though she knows he will never finish what he 's got . <p> She shrugs and hands him a dollar bill . " Here . Go order me some french fries , " she says , " if it kills you so much to share . " <p> He hops up and runs to the counter . Any sort of financial transaction fascinates him these days . She has a feeling he is going to be a banker or a stockbroker when he grows up . While she is waiting for him to return , she opens her purse and takes out Marian 's gift , hoping to distract herself from the awful scene at David 's house . She slips off the curly pink ribbon and tears open the wrapping paper and lifts the lid off the small white box . Nestled in a bed of cotton is a silver brooch , which Lynne immediately recognizes as the one she once complimented Marian on , weeks ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched by Marian 's thoughtfulness , she pins it on the breast of her sundress . <p> As she sits there alone in the booth , squinting into the late-afternoon sun , she thinks about Marian , who knows she is dying , sorting through her belongings , making little bequests such as this , putting her affairs in order . And she thinks about David driving to the racquetball club and being carried out on a stretcher . Having absolutely no inkling as he ate his breakfast and searched for a pair of clean socks or whatever that soon he would be dead . She wonders what his last words to Rachel were . She wonders if he was thinking about her , Lynne , thinking about driving over to her house after the game ended and making love to her . He could have been thinking about it as he reached for his last shot . It was not really all that unlikely . <p> On the other hand , she hears Eleanor 's voice butting in , he could have been thinking about telling you it as over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . <p> Shut up , Lynne tells her , leave me alone . What do you know ? She sighs and wonders what he would have done differently had he known , like Marian , that he was going to die soon . He probably thought he had all the time in the world to figure things out . She sighs again and wonders what she would have done differently had she known . She looks down at the damp spot on her lap and traces it with her fingertips . It is almost dry now , almost invisible , she is both glad and sad to see . <p>
