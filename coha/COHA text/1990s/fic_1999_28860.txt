A boy and a girl were spending the night together in the back seat of a Volvo estate car . The car was in a garage . It was pitch black . " I 'm hungry , " complained the girl . The boy turned on a torch and peered inside a grey canvas rucksack behind him . " There 's an apple . " " Nah . Any crisps left ? " " Nope . " Gemma sighed and leaned back in the car . She pulled a blanket over herself . " It 's cold , " she said . " Barry 'll be here soon , " Tar said . He watched her closely in the torchlight , frowning anxiously . " Sorry you came ? " he asked . Gemma looked over and smiled . " Nah . " Tar snuggled up against her . Gemma stroked his head . " You better save the batteries , " she said in a minute . Tar turned off the torch . At once it was so black you could n't see your own hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petrol , they carried on their conversation cuddling in the dark . Tar said , " Come with me . " " What ? " She was amazed , surprised . It had never occurred to her ... He could feel her staring at him even though it was too dark to see anything . In the darkness , Tar blushed deeply . " You must be crazy , " said Gemma . " Why ? " " What have I got to run away from ? " " Wait till you get home . " The two laughed . Gemma had been banned a week before from seeing Tar . Her parents had no idea where she was that night , but they had apretty good idea whom she was with . " It 'd be something to do , " said Tar in a minute . " You 're always saying how bored you are . " " That 's true . " Gemma was the most bored person she knew . Sitting in class sometimes she felt dizzy with it , that she 'd pop or faint or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd do anything just to have a life . Still ... " What about school and that ? " " You can go to school any time . " " I can run away any time in my life . " Gemma would have liked to . She wanted to . But ... What for ? She did n't love Tar , she only liked him . Her parents , and her father in particular , were totally ghastly but he did n't knock her around . Not yet anyhow . Was being bored a reason for running away to the city at fourteen years old ? Gemma said , " I do n't think so , Tar . " Tar lay still in her lap . She knew what he must be feeling because she 'd seen it on his face so many times . Tar 's heart was painted on his face . Gemma bent down close . " I 'm sorry , " she whispered . Tar had a reason , plenty of reasons . The latest were painted on his face , too . His upper lip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left eye was black , blue , yellow and red . Gemma had to be careful not to touch his wounds when she stroked his face . There was a noise at a small door behind them . Tar and Gemma ducked down out of sight behind the seats . " It 's only me . " " Bloody hellyou nearly killed me , " hissed Gemma angrily . " Sorry . Here , put that torch on so 's I can see where I 'm going . " Tar shone the beam over to a plump blond boy carrying a plastic bag . He grinned and came over . " I suppose we ought to have a secret knock or something , " he said . " Here . " He handed over the bag . Gemma poked inside . " It 's only rolls and cheese . They 'd have missed anything else , " apologised Barry . " Did n't you get any butter ? " complained Gemma . " No . But I got some pickle . " Barry handed over a pot from his coat pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the rolls and chunks of cheese . Barry had forgotten a knife ; she had to spread the pickle with her finger . Barry watched Tar 's face by the torchlight . " Christ ! He really laid into you this time , did n't he ? " " Looks like a bowl of rotten fruit , does n't it ? " said Gemma . " Not that you 'd want to eat it . " They laughed . " You have n't been turning the light on , by the way , have you ? " asked Barry anxiously . " Only ... " " We said we would n't , did n't we ? " demanded Gemma . " ... only they might see it through the cracks in the garage door . " " I told you ... " " All right . " Gemma stuffed a roll leaking pickle into her mouth . " Wan won ? " she asked Tar thickly . " Yeah , please . " He beamed . There was a pause while Gemma pulled another roll in half . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tomorrow , " said Tar . " Got everything ? " Tar leaned over the front seat and patted his rucksack . It was n't that full . Barry nodded . He watched Tar eating for a second and then he blurted out , " But what about your mum ? " Tar looked stricken . Gemma glared . " His mum 's gon na be all right . She 'll probably clear off herself once Tar 's gone . She 's only been staying because of him anyway ; she 's said that thousands of times , has n't she ? " Tar nodded slowly , like a tormented tortoise . Gemma glared at Barry and mouthed , " Shut up ! " " Right . " Barry nodded energetically . " Best thing you could do for her , clear off . She wo n't have anything to tie her to the old bastard then . " " That 's what I 'm hoping , " said Tar . It got very cold in the garage later on . Gemma and Tar snuggled up together and wrapped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop him when his hand glided under her top , but when she felt his hand sliding down her tummy she slapped his fingers lightly . " Naughty , " she said . " Why not ? " asked Tar in surprise . " Not here ... " She did n't mind him touching her there . But she was worried about spending the night together ... " I just do n't want it to go any further . " " You might never see me again after tonight , " said Tar cunningly . Gemma shook her head . " It wo n't go any further , then . " " All right . "
