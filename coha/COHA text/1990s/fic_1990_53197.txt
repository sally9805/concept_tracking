I went to the island that summer , at Webb 's invitation , because he and the island were foreign to me , mysterious , not in dark or cunning ways , but with brilliance and light . The beach and his hair gleamed with gold , his eyes and the sea flecked fathomless blue , and the sun and his smile dizzied me with prodigious heat . I was not of the island in substance or form , was not glancing light on water or pearly shell . I hoped being with him might transform me . <p> Our last night together , we went to a restaurant . As usual , the women 's heads turned as we walked in , staring after his broad shoulders , into his large blue eyes . I saw them smile into their drink glasses , avert their eyes and turn back , casting one quick critical look at me before settling again on Webb . <p> " Everyone 's staring at you , " he said , leaning across the table to take my hand . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " At both of us , then , " he said , winking . His voice was loud . It seemed no one else was talking . <p> In the beginning of the summer , their stares would have thrilled me , would have made me blush with pride , but it was mid-July and I was restless . I had the feeling I 'd been on vacation too long . Even the sun , with its ongoing radiance , can grow dull . <p> " I 'm going to miss you , " he said . He tightened his grip on my fingers . " Mrs. Lawson can be a witch , but she 'll be nice to you because you 're my girlfriend . Anyway , it 's only a month . It should be bearable until I get back . " <p> I nodded . I was conscious of the place leaning into him , of ears cocked to hear , not his words , but the rich , confiding sound of his voice . <p> " It 's great you got the job at China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though he had arranged it . <p> " Yeah , well , there are n't many Asian women around , " I said , quietly . <p> " Not many Korean sex kittens , " he said , and reached across to stroke my upper arm . <p> After dinner we drove back to his parents ' house in the Jeep , our hair streaming behind us , our words lost in the noise of the engine . It was a contemporary house of blue-gray wood set back in Polpois Harbor . Webb 's parents were divorced , but both of them loved the island so much they shared the house , each coming different months of the year . When his mother arrived , the first thing she did was take his father 's paintings down and replace them with her own . And his father did the same . Her paintings were up now , vague pastels in greenish-blues , his seascapes of tugboats hidden in the closet . <p> " Let 's go out on the beach , " Webb said , coming up behind me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night was cool . I felt the wind rippling across my body , saw it move beyond me , rippling the grass . I could hear the slapping of the waves and the hollow creaking of the boats in the harbor as they rocked on their moorings . <p> " It 's a gorgeous night , " Webb said , pulling me by the hand . I followed his shadow . We lay down together on the sand and looked up at the sky . A star dropped like molten gold . <p> " Oh , Anne , " he said , pressing against me . His hands were hot . He raised himself above me , blocking the sky and stars . I felt the sand , individual grains , grinding into my back like bits of glass . <p> When he was gone , I moved in with the Lawsons , into a large Yankee saltbox in Siasconset on a bluff by the Sankaty Head lighthouse . In exchange for a damp basement room , I emptied the dishwasher , made the beds , vacuumed , did laundry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it at home . My mother had done everything . But here , Mrs. Lawson , a businessman 's wife with an upturned nose and hooded eyes , followed after me with criticism . <p> " No , no , no , my girl , that 's no way to make a bed , " she cried , swooping down on me in one of the guest rooms . " Here , let me show you . You put the pillow ruff on like this and tuck like that . " Her red-painted fingernails moved precisely across the bed sheets . <p> After my chores , Mrs. Lawson sat in the kitchen and told me about her travels . In India there had been beggars at the airport pressed against the fence with their arms outstretched , asking for money , selling cheap trinkets . " They are animals , " Mrs. Lawson said , " not human at all . They urinate against the fence in full view . " She shuddered . Her red fingernails tapped absently against the side of her ice tea glass , riddling holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the China Winds . I was n't particularly good at this either , but the Chinese waiter , Danny , covered for me , bringing out the dishes I forgot , reminding me about picking up orders . The kitchen was hot and full of smoke . The old Chinese cooks squatted on their haunches over large black woks in the back , telling singsong stories to one another , laughing and smoking cigarettes . <p> " That place you work , " Mrs. Lawson called it , wrinkling her nose . " It 's disgusting . You can smell the grease from the tennis club ! " <p> This made Charlie , the owner of China Winds , laugh . He was short and fat , with permed hair and a jade ring on his little finger . " These rich snobs , " he said , " they hate Chinese smells . Fight like hell to keep us out . " <p> It was true that when I came home at night my hair was thick with the smell of grease , but I liked the food  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or beef with broccoli when Chang , the number one cook , thought I looked tired  --  and I liked the disorderliness of the kitchen , the roaring blue gas flames that heated the woks , the shouting in Chinese , the running in and out of orders , the jokes I could not understand . <p> Late at night the loneliness came , sweeping through the dark like the beam from the Sankaty Head lighthouse . I went out to listen to the waves , sometimes descending the bluff to sit on the beach . I got letters from Webb , charming and full of endearments , which I kept in a 9 x 12 manila envelope by the bed . <p> One night when business was slow , Charlie took the toothpick out of his mouth and pointed to Danny , the waiter . " Nothing going on here , " he said . " Take her to Chanticleer for dinner tonight . On me . Take my car . " <p> Danny looked shyly at me from behind his wire-rimmed glasses . I stared at Charlie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was stripping off twenties one by one , laying them in Danny 's hand . <p> " But it might get busy , Charlie , " I protested . <p> He shrugged . " Wednesday slow night , " he said . " Go . Have a good time . " He tossed Danny the car keys . <p> Danny drove me home to change . I took a quick shower and put on my one fancy black dress with a pearl necklace . He picked me up twenty minutes later wearing a tan suit that was too large for him . His hair was cut like a bowl , with bangs that hung in his eyes . <p> " You look nice , " Danny said , glancing at me and turning back to the road . <p> I realized we had never really said much to each other . It was always too hectic at work . He would bring me the dish of plum sauce I 'd forgotten , and I would thank him , going out the swinging door . He would be crouched on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would look up at me and smile . He was a good waiter , in the restaurant sense , quick and agile , but in another sense , too , he seemed to wait , with something in his face of patience , of sharp-eyed watching . <p> At the Chanticleer , there were awkward silences . He seemed ill at ease ; his hands went over the edge of the tablecloth , smoothing and resmoothing it , as though he were ironing . I could see people looking at us curiously , at the Oriental couple out to dinner . I wished I were with Webb . <p> The wine steward came and Danny ordered a $50 bottle of champagne . <p> " Charlie is certainly generous , " I said . <p> " That 's his problem , " Danny said , nodding vigorously . " We work together at a restaurant in New York . Same thing . Ca n't make money , he always giving it away . " <p> He put his elbows on the table . " Like he hired you , " he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Hong and Lonnie and me already . <p> You came and he said , ' Boys , I 'm going to hire her because she 's Oriental and she 's pretty and customers will like her . " ' <p> I laughed . " Well , I knew it could n't have been my waitressing credentials . " <p> Danny shook his head . " You the worst waitress I ever saw , " he said . " Terrible . " His dark eyes shone with delight . <p> " Your parents did n't teach you Korean ? " Danny asked as he drove me home . <p> " No . " <p> He shook his head . " For Chinese , " he said , " such a thing would be impossible . " <p> " I grew up in an all-white neighborhood , " I said . " I guess they thought I 'd never need it . " <p> He turned into the Lawsons ' driveway and turned the motor off . " You ever been to Korea ? " <p> " When I was six . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing eels in the courtyard of my grandfather 's house , and later eating them for dinner . And being scared of my grandfather . He was dying of emphysema . He would yell at me and my cousins in this raspy voice and then have a coughing fit . <p> " And I remember going to bow at my grandmother 's grave , " I said , startled by my memory . " It was a huge grassy mound on top of a mountain reserved for my relatives . My father said there was a place for him and my mother there , and for me and my brother , too , but that we 'd probably want to be buried in the U.S. " <p> " Really ? " Danny frowned . " Not with your family ? " <p> " I 'm American , " I said . <p> He did n't say anything . I stared out the windshield , waiting for the wedge of light from Sankaty Head to swing around again . Danny turned to look at me . Behind his glasses , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys ? " he said . <p> I laughed . " Of course not , " I said . <p> Danny watched me . He nodded . " I see you with your boyfriend , " he said . " California surfer boy . " He gave me a mocking smile . " Where he go ? " <p> " He 's looking for an apartment in Berkeley , " I said . " He 'll be back in a couple weeks . " <p> Danny started the engine . " I leave Sunday , " he said . " Business too slow here . I go back to restaurant in New York . " <p> I lay in bed remembering one of the last days before Webb left . We were on the beach at Nobadeer or Miacomet ; it did n't matter which , they were all the same : gentle dunes of sand leveling to a broad strip by the water , dotted with bodies , with fat paperback books and Frisbees , plastic buckets and inflatable water wings , hazy with heat waves , buzzing with music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand with my feet . Webb was talking to a girl he 'd known for years , with whom he 'd spent summers on the island every year since he was small . They were reminiscing about the summer romance they 'd had when they were fourteen . I could see his broad and golden back as he leaned away from me . <p> " . . . and when we went out in the Sunfish and the mast cracked and we had to haul it back . . . " she was saying , giggling , reaching out to touch his arm . <p> Her blue eyes were so much like his own , her straight blond hair only a shade darker than his . I tried to imagine what it had been like for them at fourteen , for these twins with the elemental coloring of the island , of summer itself , finding in each other a mirror reflection , a perfect and dazzling picture of themselves to fall in love with . <p> I hated Webb at that moment  --  for ignoring me , for flirting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised by its force , for what I was not part of and could never share , and for how much it mattered to me . <p> I forced the sand between my toes , covered up my shins , my knees , burying myself , crumbling into sand . I was invisible . No one knew I existed on Earth . I watched the seagulls waft on gentle winds , above the breaking of the waves . <p> Saturday night Charlie told the staff there would be a farewell party for Danny after closing . The first drink was on the house , Chen , the bartender , announced . The restaurant was busy ; we barely had time to clean and reset our tables between seatings . I had a group of twelve sunburned fishermen in from an all-day fishing party . Danny helped me serve them , bringing out the trays with military flourish . He stood by as I put the dishes on the table and helped me remember their names as I lifted the lids . <p> " Shrimp with lobster sauce , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shu pork with twelve pancakes . Hunan beef in hot garlic sauce . " <p> " Hey , your English is pretty good , " a bearded man in a Yankees cap said to me , his thick eyebrows joined in surprise . <p> " Thank you very much , " I said . " Kung bo chicken . Five jewels fried rice . " <p> Later I sat at the bar drinking from a tall glass with a paper parasol in it . The lights were dim , candles flickered in red goblets covered with plastic fish net . Golden dragons hung from the garish red walls . <p> " So she say to me "  --  Charlie imitated a high-pitched American accent  --  " ' Why you do n't serve some rreal Chinese food , Charlie ? Like how about chop suey or chow mein ? " ' He laughed and scratched his belly . <p> " Stupid guay-lo , " said Chen , morosely . He gave the bar a halfhearted swab with a dish towel . His thick brows worked lower against the slight bridge of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English very well , " said Danny , looking at me . " She speak better than him . " <p> I smiled . He looked proud , as though I had done something extraordinary . <p> " Stupid foreigner , " Chen muttered again . <p> " Ha , who 's foreigner here ? " said Charlie . Chen grunted . He scowled , then brought his palm down on the counter . The glasses jumped . " I try get her stay , " he said , " but she say she tired . " His face was flushed scarlet across both cheeks . <p> " Maybe she was , " Charlie said , shrugging . <p> " Naw , " Chen sneered . " She no like Chinese man , " he said . " Like only white meat . " Chen mumbled something in Chinese and poured himself a glass of Scotch . <p> My Mai Tai tasted cloyingly sweet . I swirled the ice around in my glass with the purple parasol . " I 've got to go , " I said , getting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Without a word , Charlie handed his car keys to Danny and patted me on the shoulder . The others said goodnight . <p> " Way to go , Danny , " said Chen , with a bitter smile , " get Anne try yellow meat . Peking duck ! Ha ha ! " <p> Danny was silent in the car . I studied his serious expression . He looked angry ; his normally placid face was etched with lines . He gazed straight out the windshield . <p> We got to the Lawsons ' . He pulled into the driveway and kept the engine running . <p> " Well . . . goodbye , " I said , " thanks for the ride . " He did n't look at me . " Hope business is better in New York . We 'll miss you . " I pulled the door latch and the overhead light went on . Danny grabbed my wrist . <p> " Anne , " he said , " please . I . . . " He blinked at me . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy , until I have to leave ! " <p> I stared at him . " What are you talking about , Danny ? Why do you have to leave ? " <p> " Because of you ! " he said , letting go of my wrist . He turned to face the steering wheel . " The other night , " he went on , " after I drop you off , I drive up to the lighthouse and sit there until three in the morning thinking about you . I 'm in love with you since first I saw you . " <p> " Oh , Danny , " I said . " I 'm sorry . " <p> " Yeah , you sorry , " he hissed . <p> His face in profile was flat , his glasses perched on the almost nonexistent bridge of his nose . His coarse black hair tapered at the base of his neck , beneath the collar of a Hawaiian shirt . He looked miserable . I did feel sorry for him , but I wanted to feel more , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses were knocked off-center . I could taste the alcohol on his lips , the sweetness of Mai Tail I felt a dizziness like intoxication , a sense of time elongating , the moment stretching like taffy to filament , then flying apart . I drew back from him and saw my reflection in his eyes , small and isolate , glancing away with a hangdog shame . <p> I woke up the next day to the sound of a voice screaming from the top of the stairs . " Anne ! When are you going to get up ? It 's almost noon and the dishwasher needs emptying ! Anne ! Wake up ! This is not a hotel I 'm operating here ! " <p> When I came up to the kitchen , Mrs. Lawson pointed a polished fingernail at me . " Where were you last night ? " she asked . " I saw you with that boy , sitting in the driveway . Really , Anne , what would Webb say ? " She shook her head , her thin brow uplifted . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've caught the best prize on the island . Any of the summer girls would kill for Webb 's attentions . And you treat him like that ! " Her eyes held all her anger , hard and gray like ball bearings . <p> " I just took you in as a favor to Webb , " Mrs. Lawson went on , holding both hands up . " And you take advantage of us both . " She left , shaking her head . <p> I started to unload the dishwasher , taking out the plates and stacking them on the cabinet shelf . I felt the anger slowly make its way to the surface until acid tears choked the back of my throat . I stopped then , fingering the plate in my hands . It was pastel yellow with a pink rim . It smashed against the floor . <p> I packed quickly and said goodbye , leaving Mrs. Lawson open-mouthed like a fish , words stuck in her throat like hooks . Then I was heading down the road with my thumb out , trying to hitch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my suitcase banging against my leg , trying to remember what Webb looked like . His image in my mind was flat , indistinct ; obscured , like everything else on the island , in a harsh , assuming light . It was Danny I remembered , not even Danny , but the kiss . The kiss I remembered vividly , as if there had been a whole history behind it , a relationship to put it in . <p> By the side of the road , sun glinted off sand , tall sea grass bobbed and bowed in the wind . I felt the stickiness of salt like a varnish against my skin . The suitcase bumped awkwardly at my knee . I shifted its weight and kept on walking . <p> <p> By Katherine Min <p>
