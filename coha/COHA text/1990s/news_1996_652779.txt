<p> YOU 'RE GOING OUT THERE A youngster , " Warner Baxter warns the young Ruby Keeler at the climax of the 1933 film " Forty-Second Street , " " but you 've got to come back a star ! " Baxter 's urgent tone reflects a terror of unemployment at the height of the Depression . " Two hundred people ! , " he emphasizes . " Two hundred jobs ! " Nevertheless , Keeler 's split-second glance of elation as she cases the auditorium after stepping on stage tells us her agenda is less social welfare than that Great American Privilege , fame . <p> This is reasonable ; this is theater . Throughout its golden age of Jerome Kern , Rodgers and Hart , the Gershwins and Cole Porter , the Broadway musical specialized in the induction of fresh talent . Just as Keeler replaces an injured ( but also aging , therefore , as Hollywood sees it , powerless ) Bebe Daniels in " Forty-Second Street , " so there was a constant absorption and elevation of newcomers . <p> That 's all finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the integration of new star talent . When a uniquely charismatic performer does appear , there is no follow-up role to proclaim his or her arrival  --  no " Funny Girl , " say , to celebrate the discovery of a Barbra Streisand in " I Can Get It for You Wholesale , " a show she stole so thoroughly that she made one of the greatest show-biz careers not only possible but absolutely necessary ( even if it took her away from the theater for life ) . <p> This is why theatergoers have been so enthusiastic about the appearance , in a single season , of three of the most popular musical-comedy stars of the post-World War II era : Carol Channing , Julie Andrews and Carol Burnett ( though Ms. Burnett , in a comedy , is n't singing ) . This trio recalls a time in Broadway 's history when going out there a youngster and coming back a star meant something to the great majority of Americans . Today , the culture looks elsewhere for its show-biz stars  --  to the movies , as always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crime . Theater , in 1990 's America , is a backwater . <p> But when the young Carol Channing made her debut in the revue " Lend an Ear " in 1948 , revealing a hit-and-run personality and a voice that covers every note between moan and squeak , it was virtually a cultural imperative that she be feted  --  or tested , perhaps ?  --  in another show , this time in a star part . As Ms. Channing had won particular notice in a spoof of 20 's musicals in " Lend an Ear , " her next engagement the following year was a 20 's spinoff , " Gentlemen Prefer Blondes , " in which she played that decade 's most essential gold digger , the cunning yet loopy Lorelei Lee . <p> Oddly , Julie Andrews also arrived in a burlesque of the 20 's , the English musical " The Boy Friend , " in 1954 . But where Ms. Channing was daffy , Ms. Andrews was cool , elegant , porcelain with a human face . After a little coaching in cockney style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliza Doolittle in " My Fair Lady , " a mating of actor and character as symmetrical as Clark Gable playing Rhett Butler . <p> Carol Burnett too made her Broadway debut in a period burlesque , the " Princess and the Pea " spoof , " Once Upon a Mattress , " in 1959 . As Winifred the Woebegone , the Princess herself , Ms. Burnett stood out in a company of nine principals for a broadness of gesture that is oddly down to earth in its effect . Like a ' edieval court jester , she expresses what we 're all feeling  --  an eagerness to please , an impatience with fools and a gratitude for kindness . She just does it the way General Patton made war . Once again , the musical 's gods of tradition and destiny demanded that she be given a main chance . After five years as television 's favorite singing comic , she too graced Broadway in a star part , the **27;211;TOOLONG in " Fade Out  --  Fade In . " <p> This ceaseless cultivation of innovative talent gave the musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command its own history . However , not long after the accession of Ms. Channing , Ms. Andrews and Ms. Burnett , the system broke down . When was the last truly important star discovered and nurtured on Broadway ? Ms. Streisand ? That was 30 years ago . <p> What happened ? Ensemble shows , for one thing  --  the dark , sophisticated " concept " musicals such as " Company , " " Grand Hotel , " " The Secret Garden . " These are operettas for grown-ups , problem plays too finely textured to endure a star turn . Moreover , the rise of pop opera has created gigantic constructions that overwhelm performer charisma with roller dome races and helicopter takeoffs , and whose popularity extends so far beyond the theatergoing community that they become tourist attractions , like the hansom cabs in Central Park or the Hard Rock Cafe . Do tourists really care who 's playing Jean Valjean this week ? <p> There is as well the current emphasis on revivals  --  literally , as if trying to pump a heartbeat into a moribund form by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has seen major reappearances of " Oklahoma ! , " " Brigadoon , " " West Side Story , " " Guys and Dolls , " " Carousel " and now " Show Boat , " none of which demands headliners . <p> True , we have also had " Gypsy , " perhaps the greatest of all star vehicles , from Ethel Merman through Angela Lansbury to Tyne Daly . But " Gypsy " is one of the exceptions that proves the rule , as is " A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum , " expected in March with Nathan Lane , and " The King and I , " originally written around Gertrude Lawrence but later staged in honor of Yul Brynner . Perhaps this " He said/She said " aspect of the latter piece will be settled when Donna Murphy and Lou Diamond Phillips square off as Anna and the King ( also in March ) , as neither is yet a star in the Broadway sense of not just charming : fascinating . Not just talented : inventive . Not just outstanding : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star roles to accommodate our newly discovered stars , where are they to work ? How is the musical to continue without this essential nourishment ? When Judy Kaye took over for Madeline Kahn in the more-or-less Carole Lombard role in " On the Twentieth Century , " there were unanimous cheers for her deliciously thorny comic style and unbearably virtuous soprano . An age ago , producers would have been lining up around the block to feature the actress in her own show ; it never happened . Mostly , Ms. Kaye does regional productions of " Annie Get Your Gun " and " The Merry Widow " or concert presentations of history-book titles like " Leave It to Jane " or " Oh , Lady ! Lady ! , " as if she were her own grandmother . <p> More recently , Faith Prince won notice in a supporting part in " Nick and Nora , " then blew the town away as a tumultuously appealing Miss Adelaide in " Guys and Dolls . " But with no follow-up vehicle , she went into a dismal play ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a television sitcom ( " High Society " ) . <p> Is it any wonder that this season the musical has concentrated on durable stars ? Ms. Channing 's Dolly made her gala return , and Ms. Andrews has reclaimed her old movie role in " Victor/ Victoria . " Ms. Burnett has a new piece , " Moon Over Buffalo . " Standing ovations are part of the package , like the playbill and souvenir T 's , because America has become a clapping nation . Television , always the bellwether , teaches how : watch as audiences on game and talk shows clap not to express approval but to provide punctuation . They clap before commercials and after commercials , when someone enters and when someone leaves , when they are told to and even when they are not . And , in the theater , they clap for Ms. Channing , Ms. Andrews and Ms. Burnett as if they 'd never seen a star before . <p> It 's odd . The cheaper fame has become , the more dearly the public values the real thing . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Dolly this afternoon ) would see them rise to their feet four times : on her entrance , after " Before the Parade Passes By , " after the title song and at her curtain call . Back in " Forty-Second Street , " Ruby Keeler only sweeps the house with her eyes . Ms. Channing stares at us , perhaps to urge us to worship : the goddess is in . All three women are at the top of their form , but that 's irrelevant . In Keeler 's day , the public clapped because stars were wonderful . Now it claps because stars are famous . <p> And dying out , at least on Broadway . Will there be no new musicals built for stars , no " Gypsy , " no " Funny Girl " ? Has performer power been purged by authors , directors , even designers ? Paradoxically , one current pop opera has produced a star role , a part that , like Rose in " Gypsy "  --  and unlike Evita or the Phantom  --  has so far demanded someone special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is pop opera 's first true diva part , as witness its catalogue of prima donnas , from Patti LuPole , Betty Buckley and now Elaine Paige in London ; Glenn Close in Los Angeles and New York ; Diahann Carroll in Toronto ; Helen Schneider in Germany ; and Ms. Buckley now in New York , to be followed by Ms. Paige in her American qtage debut in August . ( It will be interesting to see how the unknown Linda Balgord fares as Norma on the coming national tour , the first time that Andrew Lloyd Webber will run the show without a headliner . The cynical might see Ms. Balgord as an economy move ; if audiences accept " Sunset Boulevard " without a star , future productions will be easier  --  and cheaper  --  to cast . ) <p> In the old days , of course , stars stayed with their shows till they closed ; Julie Andrews played Eliza Doolittle for three and a half years , counting the New York and London runs . Performers today are less keen , and the parade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we miss in Ms. Channing , the lovable dinosaur , or in Ms. Andrews and Ms. Burnett , the heroines who walked out , if only for 30 years . These three women are simply claiming parts that belong to them , Ms. Channing and Ms. Andrews by creator 's copyright and Ms. Burnett with her playwright 's blessing . <p> The many Norma Desmonds , however , are competing in a sweepstakes , each laying claim to a role that , unlike Mary Martin 's Nellie Forbush , no one yet owns . Once , the musical built itself around stars because the performance defined the show in exactly the way that the Marx Brothers or Joan Crawford defined their movies . Today , the musical is an alchemy of composition and performance in which the former contains the latter , unfortunately at a time when composition is weak . <p> This is why revivals are so common : to bring back the experience of attending an entertai'ing show . Not an absorbing or enlightening show  --  an amusing show . What 's amusement without superb comics , singers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent . But from the performers , we want genius . Thus we compare Norma Desmonds : to retrieve the excitement of the unique performance in a genre that has stifled it . <p> We see , for instance , how Glenn Close reveled brilliantly , shamelessly , in Norma 's egomaniacal glamour , how her murder of her departing lover was , to her , logical : stardom gives the troubled ego a support structure , so to offend stardom is to attack one 's very identity . To Betty Buckley , such lurid connection between what one plays and what one is does not compute . Fame is beauty plus talent , right ? Who added murderous rage to that recipe ? It is as if Ms. Buckley were trying to rationalize stardom even as it dissolves before our eyes . So where Ms. Close played crazed , Ms. Buckley does wounded . Ms. Close fumed ; Ms. Buckley cajoles . She does n't want to kill anyone . Ms. Close 's Norma was a bat out of hell , while Ms. Buckley 's is a wounded bird . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is captivating in the way star roles used to be : the play reveals the player as we watch . That was theater : not fame itself so much as personality . <p> This must be what Warner Baxter means when he exhorts Ruby Keeler just before she comes back a star . It 's not about taking something . It 's about sharing something . It 's about being part of a culture in which gifted people liberate us all by liberating themselves . In giving up that culture , we have n't just lost the wild magic ; we have lost a belief that we need any . <p> It 's all over but the retrospectives.
