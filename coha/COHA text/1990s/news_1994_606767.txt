<p> Remember when nobody had ever heard of monkfish ? Or orange roughy ? Now there 's a new fish waiting to catch on . It 's called skate , and it 's a sweet-tasting creature of the deep  --  with wings and barbs to boot . <p> But if you 're a fish waiting to be discovered , you need an agent . Just like everybody else these days . <p> In the case of skate  --  a flat , disk-shaped relative of the shark  --  it 's restaurateurs , a congressman and trade groups that hope to elevate it from obscurity to Fish With A Cause . <p> And the story they 're telling is this : We 're in the midst of a worldwide fish crisis , largely because of overfishing . This is particularly true in New England , where haddock are now commercially extinct and cod and flounder are on the verge of becoming so . <p> While supplies of these ground fish , or bottom-feeders , have been steadily declining since the mid-1970s , skate have been multiplying like mad . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic coast as there were 20 years ago . <p> The bad news is , skate eat endangered fish , further depleting supplies . The good news is , if Americans ate more skate , there would be fewer of them to eat the cod , flounder and haddock that are in such constant demand . Stocks could increase . It 's the food chain in action . <p> Eating skate " is the environmentally correct thing to be doing , " says Emily Holt , spokeswoman for the National Fisheries Institute , an industry group that is promoting skate and another fish called cape shark in its " New Tastes for a New Reality " campaign . ( Do n't be fooled : Cape shark is really dogfish . Its name has been changed because , well , who would eat anything called dogfish ? ) <p> Joining the effort to promote skate is Rep. Barney Frank ( D-Mass. ) , whose district encompasses the hard-hit fishing towns of New Bedford and Fall River . " We can do a lot of things in the government , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you do when you have more fishermen than fish ? " <p> Frank is doing a number of things  --  trying to persuade the federal government to purchase skate and other underutilized species for its commissaries and prisons , and supporting grants for promotion and research . And he 's also eating the stuff  --  at least in public  --  although he admits he 's not a fish fanatic . <p> Recently , for example , he took the mayors of New Bedford and Newton to Kinkead 's restaurant for dinner . And what did Barney eat ? " I had the skate , " he said without missing a beat . And what about his guests ? No comment . " I 'm not at liberty to disclose that , " he said . <p> Not surprisingly , Bob Kinkead , owner of Kinkead 's in downtown D.C. , native of Massachusetts and self-appointed " Mr. Skate Wing , " is big on promoting underutilized species . Because of its large supply and small demand , skate is an inexpensive buy , Kinkead points out . And although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees great promise in its future ; skate has a mild , almost sweet-flavored white flesh that " lends itself to interesting dishes , " he says . On Kinkead 's menu this month : Skate Wings with Veal Juice and Celeriac Pure'e . On Dupont Circle 's Pesce 's menu last week : Herb-Breaded Skate with Bok Choy and Risotto Cake . At L'Auberge Chez Franclois in Great Falls , Poached Skate Wings with Caper Vinaigrette has been on the menu for more than 20 years . <p> A fish with wings is n't the only thing that makes skate so odd . ( Those " wings , " the only edible portion of the fish , are actually large pectoral fins . ) Skate skin , it turns out , has tiny barbs on it . Kinkead knows more than he wants to know about those barbs . This summer , while a fish cutter was on vacation , Kinkead did some cutting himself . Literally . " By the end of the afternoon , after fileting 20 wings of skate , my knuckles were all scraped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a " tough guy " to wear gloves . <p> He 's a smart guy , though , in realizing that restaurateurs play a part in creating demand for new fish : People try it while they 're out , then experiment at home . <p> Larry Sylvia , owner of F &S; Fisheries , a processor in New Bedford , is also going after restaurants . Sylvia , founder of the recently launched Underutilized , Undermarketed Seafood Species Association of America , plans to take skate samples to the test kitchens of large restaurant chains like Red Lobster . Sylvia is also trying to sell the fish to state prisons , and the association has a contract with a New Bedford chef to develop matching sauces for underutilized species , also known in some corners as " trash fish . " <p> Europeans saw gold in our garbage long ago . Most of the underutilized species that are n't tossed back into the sea get exported ; when you order fish and chips in England , you may be getting dogfish , and skate has long been popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the menus of local French restaurants . <p> " The French eat everything , " says Karen Ryan , chef at Pesce . " They 're much more adventurous . " <p> Washingtonians can be more adventurous with the following skate recipes . The fish is also good simply saute'ed in a little olive oil and butter . <p> SCOTT MELO 'S STEAMED SKATE WITH LEMON GRASS , GINGER , ORANGE AND LIME <p> ( 4 servings ) <p> This recipe won first prize in a recent contest sponsored by the National Fisheries Institute to raise awareness about underutilized species .
