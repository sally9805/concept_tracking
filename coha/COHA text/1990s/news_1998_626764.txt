<p> Japan 's system not inferior <p> The May 1 Viewpoints letter , " Gun policy costs for Japan , " was in error regarding Japan 's court system and gun-control laws . The letter asserted that Japanese citizens are " routinely " subjected to searches of their persons and property when , in fact , law-abiding Japanese citizens enjoy the same protection as American citizens from unnecessary searches and seizures . <p> Arrested persons and their immediate surroundings may be searched by police without prior approval of a judge . However , other searches and seizures require judicial warrants , based on adequate cause . The warrants , like those issued by U.S. judges , must state clearly and specifically what is being sought . <p> While it is true that local policemen in Japan visit the homes in their jurisdiction on an annual basis , these visits are not , as the letter implied , for the purpose of inspections . Rather , the visits give residents a much-desired chance to air concerns and ask questions and give the police valuable , personal insight into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imprisonment of criminal suspects , no one can be detained without adequate cause and Japan 's Constitution , like that of the United States , mandates the right to a speedy trial and counsel . <p> There is nothing sinister behind the high rates of confession in Japan . Confessions obtained by force , torture or threat , or after prolonged arrest or detention , are inadmissible as evidence and a confession can not be the only evidence used to support a conviction in Japan . <p> As in the United States , arrested persons do have the right to remain silent during all legal proceedings against them . <p> The statement that " suspects on trial have no right to a jury " is logically flawed , based on the fact that Japan does not use the jury system . Depending on the situation , a case may be heard by either one or by three constitutionally independent judges . <p> Japan 's system has worked well for many years and should not be deemed inferior simply because it is different from that of the United States . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lowest gun-death rates in the world . The Japanese people willingly accept this prohibition in exchange for a safer , more secure society . <p> Susumu Tanaka , deputy consul general , Consulate-General of Japan , Houston <p> <p> Death penalty is upheld by juror <p> Responding to the June 8 Viewpoints letter from Charles Sage ( " Death penalty trauma for family " ) : I was one of the 12 jurors who convicted the murderer of Sage 's sister , Marilyn Sage Meagher , unanimously and without reservation . Death by lethal injection was far too easy a way out for this poor excuse of a human . <p> Meagher was suffocated , stabbed and then bludgeoned to death . She died slowly and painfully . <p> When the jury was deliberating guilt or innocence , we were given the police photograph of the murderer , which showed no remorse on his smiling face . <p> The punishment phase of the trial took us three hours . We wanted to be sure what we decided would be upheld and we had to consider the questions as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for error . <p> The fact that he had AIDS was not a mitigating factor . Just because a person has an illness is not reason to kill another person . What if a cure for AIDS was found and he had lived ? Parole in 20 years ? <p> This could not be a possibility . He was an ongoing , continuing threat to society . <p> This murderer had a tough childhood . . . . Too bad . This could be used to excuse any adult 's behavior . <p> Many who have endured worse problems than his have risen above them and have become productive people . <p> Although I have never been able to find out the murderer 's fate , I hope his demise was at least a bit as painful as Meagher 's . <p> John M. Engel , Houston <p> <p> Death 's an expensive trip <p> As an advocate for the elderly , there was a time when my voice was strong enough to be heard by politicians and , at times , by presidents . <p> They listened to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voting booths . <p> Now I am in " weaker voice . " I am homebound and consider myself fortunate to be heard when I need help getting into my wheelchair . But I can still feel indignation at the treatment of my former " constituents . " <p> In my 80s , my prognosis is not cheerful . I recently was " inspired " to go shopping for my final trip . The cost of dying is phenomenal . <p> I got ( finally ) a bargain-basement price . It was a mere $ 5,000 , exclusive of gravesite , as I bough one for myself years ago . What Social Security pays for an internment would hardly pay for the nails to secure a coffin . <p> Al Lieberman , Stafford <p> <p> President travels for funds <p> The president 's recent trip to Houston was made after requests by some Hispanic politicians and if any of these people think that is why he came , they must have a great ego . The real reason Bill Clinton came to Houston was plain and simple : a $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will tell you anything you want to hear . Look back at trips he has made since the last election . With the exception of some disaster areas he has visited , every trip has been a fund-raiser . <p> Carl Powell , Houston <p> <p> Only English street signs <p> I oppose street signs in anything but English , even if paid for with private funds . I lived in Holland for a while . Do you think the Dutch provided English street signs for me ? <p> If anyone in the United States chooses not to learn English or finds it difficult , they can , at the least , learn to read street signs . Putting street signs up in other languages would be culturally divisive - what we need is more unity . <p> Gus Browning , Houston <p> <p> Memorial Day not a party <p> In response to Stephen Betzen 's letter ( May 30 , Viewpoints , " New day needed as ' memorial ' " ) , I feel Betzen needs to take a little time to educate himself on the Memorial Day we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebration , but a day to remind us that thousands of people were taken from their jobs as teachers , doctors , nurses , police officers , office workers , cooks and many other hundreds of endeavors and never returned from their service to their country . <p> Most who died in this century were killed on foreign soil and lay there , never to return . <p> Their sacrifice is what is memorialized on Memorial Day . <p> If you can not find it in your heart to remember those who died and are eternally maimed , please lower the shade in your window , stay at home and enjoy the dark little world they secured for you . <p> Carl M.

I wonder who owns the sub-contracting firm that paid Murphy . <p> Is there a pattern here ? How many contracts under the city 's affirmative action plan are awarded to firms that actually do the work ? <p> Are very many of these or are all of these contracts awarded to " shell " companies as political favors ? Say it is n't so . <p> Roger Vernon , Tomball
