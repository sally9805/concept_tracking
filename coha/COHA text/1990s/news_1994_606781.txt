<p> UKRAINE IS the new Cinderella . It could just metamorphose from bankruptcy and potential civil war to surpass elder sister Russia in reform and perhaps even consensus . <p> The grand ball takes place tomorrow through Wednesday with President Leonid Kuchma 's Washington debut . The princely G-7 benefactors will be adjusting and readjusting , for many mornings after , the $ 4 billion glass slipper they have pledged . At the moment the unpleasant stepmother is nowhere to be seen ; the Kiev parliament , despite its earlier imprecations on privatization , is acquiescing in Kuchma 's bold economic reform and even , as of a few days ago , in adhering to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty . <p> To be sure , the old image is hard to erase . Last year inflation reached 8,940 percent , dwarfing the ruble 's hyperinflation . This year industrial production plunged another 36 percent after its previous steep decline . More than a third of Ukrainian workers have not been paid their pittance for months and depend instead on barter and their village cousins for food . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cholera broke out last summer . The clash between Ukraine 's nationalist west and Russian-speaking east had the CIA writing worst-case civil war scenarios last winter . Corruption has rivaled Russia 's and Colombia 's , with various ministers in the pre-Kuchma government boasting about how much they had appropriated . <p> The Supreme Rada ( legislature ) is controlled by a plurality of Communists and ex-Communists who , like the Russian duma before the shootout with Boris Yeltsin a year ago , are suspicious of reform and zealous in asserting a parliamentary prerogative to run the executive , the courts , the central bank , and everything else in the present constitutional limbo . <p> Yet the very catastrophe of the past three years of drift and no reform has convinced much of the public that painful economic reform could n't possibly be worse than what they have already experienced . " My relatives voted for Kuchma after four years of only worsening of the situation , " says Dmitry Schlapachenko , a young Ukrainian journalist currently studying at Duke University . After this month 's price hikes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket on public transportation , with the average salary $ 10 . But many people have come to the conclusion that what Kuchma is doing is very important for Ukraine . " His reform and the new Western aid it is eliciting produce a " mental fact that somebody is helping us . Somebody cares about us ... . We can hope for something . And we are not alone in the world . " <p> Moreover , Kuchma 's activism has helped convince two of the three elite antireform lobbies that they can extract no more monopoly-capitalist windfalls from inflation and crony credits , maintains Anders Aslund , the Swedish reform adviser to Kuchma . The weapons manufacturers , whose plants used to account for almost two-thirds of Ukraine 's total production , finally realize that future success can come only from modernization , Aslund contends . And even the coal barons are beginning to grasp that serious money to transform their mines can come only from the West , in conjunction with reform . <p> That leaves as firm enemies of reform the " agricrats " who run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too the peasant families who survived Stalin 's murderous collectivization and famine in the 1930s , conformed to the required passivity for three generations since then and now feel threatened by change and the prospect of having to assume responsibility . After Kuchma announced his reform , the newspaper Village News expressed the common fear in asserting , " The Ukrainian people will starve and freeze . " <p> The rural opposition has many allied legislators . As recently as last summer parliament suspended all land privatization , then forbade privatization of transportation , energy and other major sectors . In September it passed yet another round of inflationary agricultural credits . Typically , Speaker Oleksander Moroz has branded land privatization a " crime . " <p> Nonetheless , when Kuchma gave his inaugural policy address on Oct. 11  --  the Black Tuesday on which the ruble plummeted , as it happened  --  the Rada meekly approved his comprehensive program of stabilization , liberalization and privatization . <p> The cause of this switch was in part disillusionment with the calamitous drift under previous President Leonid Kravchuk , a communist ideologist turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further incentive was the attraction of the $ 4 billion the United States ( along with Canada and Germany ) got the G-7 industrial nations to promise Ukraine last summer should any real economic reform appear . And the final contributor was the unanticipated political skill of Kuchma in courting legislators , including the 70 percent of novices who entered parliament this year . <p> Kuchma , in fact , has been a surprise all around . " I thought he was energetic and decisive " after an initial meeting with him last April , says R. Nicholas Burns , senior director for Russia , Ukraine and Eurasia affairs at the National Security Council . " But I did n't think his instincts would be to push economic reform or advance NPT the nuclear nonproliferation treaty as he has done ... . It 's a remarkable transformation  --  and in the nick of time . There was a feeling in our government that the Ukrainian nation was at risk because of its lack of economic reform . " <p> Kuchma , the peasants ' son turned technocrat , then manager of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first upset expectations by winning the runoff presidential election against the incumbent last July . After campaigning on the single theme of improving the country 's bad relations with Russia , he gained fewer than 10 percent of the votes in the nationalist west  --  but he gained more than 80 percent in the more populous east and tipped the balance in the center . <p> Kuchma next astounded friend and foe alike by turning out to be both a real Ukrainian and a real reformer . He made the effort to speak his childhood Ukrainian in public rather than his more fluent adult Russian . He noted archly that the Russian majority on the Crimean peninsula that keeps agitating for union with Moscow accepted Ukrainian sovereignty by voting for him as Ukrainian president . He conspicuously invited to Kiev as his first official visitor , International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus ( rather than Russian President Yeltsin ) . He gradually weeded out the old advisers he had inherited in favor of young , reform-minded ones like Economics Minister Roman Shpek . He welcomed as foreign advisers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Soros . He accepted the argument that reform was the only thing that could rescue Ukraine from its catastrophe . <p> So far it 's little more than words , of course . But these radical words have already persuaded the United States , Canada and the IMF  --  the European Union is balking  --  to pledge $ 725 million in stabilization support for Ukraine for the last quarter of 1994 . The U.S. Congress is bending its usual rules to provide balance-of-payments support from technical assistance funds and at $ 350 million this year has elevated Ukraine to its fourth-largest recipient of aid , after Israel , Egypt and Russia . Washington further persuaded Russia and Turkmenistan to join this particular G-7 club in rescheduling $ 3 billion in Ukrainian oil-and-gas debts . President Clinton is also bestowing on Kuchma this week the status of a full state visit , an honor from this administration he shares only with Yeltsin , the Japanese emperor and South Africa 's Nelson Mandela . <p> Can Kuchma 's gamble work ? Or more precisely , can it work fast enough to offset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economist John Hardt thinks so . He points out that " they have such an untapped reservoir of inefficiencies " in the energy and agricultural chains that dramatic improvement could come swiftly . " It takes a lot of doing to waste energy as they do . It takes a lot of doing to destroy crops as they do , so half that come up in the field do n't get to the market ... because there are no trucks ... . You could turn it around in six months to a substantial degree . " <p> Politically too , Kuchma would seem to have some leeway . The Ukrainians have shown incredible patience in not mounting major street protests against ever-worsening conditions in recent years . And Kuchma 's combination of reform at home and easing of relations with Russia abroad has already relieved regional tensions within Ukraine . Some of the Western nationalists , convinced finally that he is not selling out Ukraine , are joining his reform team . The fledgling president has reintroduced hope in a common Ukrainian future for the first time since resident Russians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the expectation that their standard of living would get better , not worse , than Russia 's . <p> Moreover , there is no ethnic hostility between Ukrainians and the 11 million Russians in Ukraine , who constitute almost half of the instant Russian diaspora thrown up by Soviet disintegration . Indeed , with the exception of Russian-Tatar animosity on Crimea , treatment of minorities is exemplary . Antisemitism is minor , according to Bension Kotlik of the Jewish community in Lviv . Far right parties do exist , especially in the west , and even field a few paramilitary units  --  but they fared poorly in this year 's elections . Besides , both right and left extremes are being increasingly pushed to the margins as the interminable runoff elections like today 's bring ever more centrists to fill the remaining empty seats in the Rada . <p> " It 's a rocky road ahead , " says Burns . But Washington is doing its utmost to make Ukraine 's traversing of the road of reform and independence a success . " Ukraine is awfully important for the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you look in a crystal ball , 50 or 75 years from now Ukraine can either be a major power in Europe or the sick man of Europe ... . Ukraine 's greatest challenge is to get on its feet economically . Economics drives just about everything . If they are successful in stabilizing and reforming , that will give them a sense of self-confidence as a nation and improve their chances to be a truly independent state . That 's our goal : to have a strong , stable state in Europe . " <p> That is only the easy part , of course . The next step involves giving the " incredulous " Russians time to digest the fact that after three centuries of union , Ukraine really is a separate country . And the step after that involves creating at home , after three centuries as a Russian province , a sense of distinct identity broad enough to win the loyalty of patriotic western Ukrainians , eastern Russian-speaking Ukrainians , Russians and the 2 million Hungarians , Ruthenians and other non-Slavs . <p> And all that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning into a pumpkin . <p> Elizabeth Pond , a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center , writes for Nowa Europe in Warsaw and is studying the Polish and Ukrainian Western cooperative system .
