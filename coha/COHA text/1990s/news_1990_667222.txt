<p> The Buffalo Bills are like Sybill in shoulder pads . <p> They 're a football team with multiple personalities to go with their multiple formations and multiple wins . <p> Which team will the Bills be tonight when they meet the Houston Oilers ( 5- 5 ) in the Astrodome ( ABC , 9 p.m . EST ) ? <p> Who knows ? <p> Maybe they 'll be the Bills who have shutouts or blowouts in their last four games . Maybe they 'll be the Bills who improvised fourth-quarter victories in the three games before that . Or maybe they 'll reveal an entirely new side to their ever-changing team face . <p> Last season , the so-called " bickering Bills " showed their dark side , quarreling among themselves on their way to 9-8 . <p> This season they 're 9-1 and , by their own account , one big happy family . But somehow that image of infighting lingers . <p> " That bickering Bills thing will never die , " shrugs linebacker Ray Bentley . " Must be people like the alliteration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is one sure way to drive a wooden stake through the heart of that undead image . <p> " All we need to do , " he says , " is win the Super Bowl . " <p> Sounds simple enough . But this is a franchise a local columnist once likened to the myth of Sisyphus - doomed to an eternity of rolling a rock uphill only to have it roll down again before reaching the top . <p> The Bills began the ' 80s as division champs , ready to ascend the mountain . By the mid- ' 80s they were the worst team in the NFL - flattened by Sisyphus ' rock once more . In 1988 they were 11-1 before stumbling in the stretch . In 1989 they were a consensus pick to reach their first Super Bowl . So what happened ? They barely broke .500 while figuratively breaking each other 's noses . <p> Sisyphus strikes again ! History said they should have continued downhill this season . <p> " We 're here to rewrite history , " says linebacker Cornelius Bennett . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little history . " <p> And these 1990 Bills just might do that . They have star talent on offense and defense . Quarterback Jim Kelly has no 300-yard passing days yet enters tonight 's game as the conference 's highest-rated quarterback . Thurman Thomas ' 90 yards a game leads the league in rushing . Bennett and defensive end Bruce Smith anchor a dominating defense that might lead the league in big plays . <p> But now comes murderers ' row on the Bills ' schedule . In their last five games , they played good football against bad teams . All had losing records . In the six games ahead , they must play good football against good teams . Only one has a losing record . <p> " We 're going to play tough teams , " says Bennett . " But I look at it like they 're playing a tough team in us . " <p> In 1988 , the Bills blew a chance at the Super Bowl by losing three of their last four games , frittering away home-field advantage in the conference title game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Today the Bills have the best record in the conference . If they can hold that advantage in these grueling final weeks , they will get as many as two playoff games at home . The AFC championship game could be in Buffalo on Jan. 20 , when home-tundra advantage would mean the most . <p> " We know what 's at stake this time , " says Bennett . " We have to keep the dream in front of us . " <p> Last season the dream died in Cleveland : Browns 34 , Bills 30 , with a trip to the conference title game on the line . One play embodied the Bills ' season in microcosm . Running back Ron Harmon dropped what would have been the game- winning catch on third down - then returned to the huddle and complained the ball was overthrown . Imagine that . The season was down to a final play , and those bickering Bills were at it again . Kelly 's fourth-down pass was intercepted . Fade to black . <p> This season is different . Harmon signed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marv Levy instituted a 12-player committee to ward off bad vibes in the locker room . No matter that the committee mostly discusses inconsequential issues like what time to eat lunch . Some committee members were among the bickerers ; now they are among the team leaders . <p> Harmon is out . Harmony is in . <p> Winning will do that for you . But what might have happened had the Bills lost back-to-back home games to the Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Raiders just before their bye , when they would have had two weeks to stew about it ? <p> " It could have got ugly , " admits Bentley . " But why talk about that ? It did n't happen . " <p> It did n't because the Bills would n't let it . They appeared headed for losses both times but exploded for 20 fourth-quarter points in 77 seconds to detonate the game against the Broncos , then 24 fourth-quarter points in six minutes to overtake the Raiders . <p> Blocked kicks returned for touchdowns begat both turnarounds . That 's how it is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with offense . Sometimes they win with defense . Sometimes they win with special teams . But most of the time , they win . <p> Their only loss came 30-7 in Miami in the season 's second game . The Dolphins will visit Rich Stadium two days before Christmas . Miami has never played in Buffalo in December before . The division title might be decided in that game . <p> But first come the Oilers and their run-and-shoot offense tonight . Last season the Bills outgunned Houston 47-41 in overtime in the Astrodome . The season before , the Bills beat the Oilers 17-10 in their only home playoff game since Rich Stadium opened in 1973 . Their road playoff record in that span is an ugly 1-5 . <p> The upshot is this : The Bills , who play four of their last six away from home , must win road games now to avoid playoff road games later . <p> " There is nothing you can do to state it enough , " says special teams dynamo Steve Tasker . " We like to play at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stadiums in larger cities draw a corporate crowd ; the Bills draw a raucous , full-throat , collegiate-style crowd . Last week they sold 74,720 tickets for a game against lowly New England . All but 144 people came - a minuscule no-show count . <p> Buffalo , by any measure , loves its Bills . How much ? The quarterback , coach and general manager have radio shows . Nothing unusual there . But the long snapper - the guy who hikes the ball on field goals and punts - has a show , too . <p> " The fans here are the best in the world , but they can be tough on you , " says Bentley . " If you 're not doing good , you 're going to hear about it . If you are doing good , you are a god . " <p> These days , the Bills are gods . The question is : Can these gridiron gods reach the Super Bowl , their Mount Olympus , without the rock rolling over them again ? <p> These last six games , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that theological question . <p> But first must come answers to Buffalo 's 45-player riddle . Who are these Bills - Sybill or Sisyphus ? <p> How many personalities do they have ? And will the real Buffalo Bills please stand up ? Tonight , and in the weeks ahead , they 'll have to . CUTLINE : CORNELIUS BENNETT : Says team united in goal .
