<p> Every fall , the world 's automakers begin their annual assault on the U.S. car market . The model year , which traditionally begins Oct. 1 , brings a highwayful of new vehicles-plus a traffic jam of ads touting all the changes . For 1991 , a flood of new models is pouring into a consumer market confused by economic uncertainty , a Middle East crisis and soaring gasoline prices . That means the ads must work harder than ever before . <p> So the major automakers will spend more than $ 6 billion to advertise their ' 91 models , industry analysts estimate . That record sum is almost enough to buy a new Plymouth Sundance America or Dodge Shadow America ( base sticker price , $ 7,699 ) for everyone who lives in Montana . <p> As part of their sell-smart strategy , the ' 91 ads are sounding common themes : <p> - Sharp focus on safety . Air bags and anti-lock brakes get as much play as tail fins in the ' 50s . <p> - Female power . Toyota , for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . So more women appear in ads - and as decision-makers , not solely as spouses or moms . <p> - Rival models get targeted by name . Plymouth Acclaim proclaims it 's better than Honda Accord . Infiniti Q45 goes after Lotus . <p> - A renewed emphasis on fuel economy . Larger cars like Buick and Cadillac brag about mileage figures . <p> On this page , USA TODAY reporter and columnist Stuart Elliott reviews the ' 91 auto campaigns , based on more than 370 TV and print ads . <p> The fine print : This page reviews national ads now appearing for 27 major automakers selling cars and minivans . Not out yet : Subaru , due in early November . The bulk of BMW 's campaign is due in mid-November , following ads for its 7 series now out . And the bulk of Nissan 's campaign is due after Jan. 1 , following ads for its Sentra model now out . <p> Rating the car ads What better way to rate TV and print advertising for 1991 cars and minivans than to award them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The car our rating system uses is the Volkswagen Beetle . The Beetle is our choice because its ads , by the old Doyle Dane Bernbach agency , are considered to be the best ever created for a car . The scale runs from 1 to 5 Beetles . What the Beetles mean : <p> # 1 . The ad equivalent of an auto bomb like the Edsel . <p> # 2 . The ad equivalent of a car like the DeSoto - once popular , but now just a name from the past . ### 3 . The ad equivalent of a car like the Ford Tempo - right in the middle of the road . #### 4 . The ad equivalent of a car like the Honda Civic - popular and a top seller , though just shy of burning up the track . ##### 5 . The ad equivalent of a smash-hit car like the Mazda Miata . <p> Acura <p> ##1/2 <p> Ads for the NSX sports car convey a sense of speed and excitement : " What good is adrenaline if you ca n't tap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A slick 12-page magazine brochure makes you really eager to get behind the wheel . Agency : Ketchum Advertising/Los Angeles . <p> Buick <p> #1/2 <p> Ads for three new models - Park Avenue , Park Avenue Ultra , Regal sedan - are too matter-of-fact . Your pulse hardly races over headlines like " Introducing a whole new class of American sedan : world class . " A TV ad claiming , " It took vision and courage to bring it to you , " is better suited to a wonder drug . Buick 's boasting that it is the only U.S. car ranked in a J.D. Power survey is more effective : " But then , quality has never been foreign to us , " says a TV ad . Agency : McCann-Erickson . <p> Cadillac <p> ## <p> For ' 91 , ads offer reasons to back up the longtime slogan , " The only way to travel is Cadillac style . " Selling points - " substance behind the style , " print ads say - include safety and owner loyalty . But a TV ad on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's " just as responsible to own as it is responsive to drive . " C'm on . Agency : D'Arcy Masius Benton &; Bowles . <p> Chevrolet <p> ## <p> Chevy 's familiar slogan gets remodeled : Now it 's " More people are winning with the heartbeat of America . " TV ads tell a victory story persuasively , such as one stating that " the first car more people bring home is Chevy Cavalier . " Print ads suffer from outdated sayings like " Out of sight , " or " It 's something else . " Agency : Lintas : Campbell-Ewald . <p> Chrysler <p> ## <p> Safety ads come across as stuffy : " Because the most important thing that goes into our cars is you . " More effective are pricing pitches , such as a television ad matching Fifth Avenue against Cadillac : Rival salesmen together chant features that the two cars share - but the Chrysler costs $ 9,500 less . And a TV ad for LeBaron attacks the Germans and Japanese for charging more for cars " than most people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Agency : Bozell Inc . <p> Dodge <p> #1/2 <p> Another patriotic pitch , this time themed , " America is coming home to Dodge . " The last one to use such a slogan - " Come home , America " - was George McGovern , and we all remember what happened to him . The message gets especially muddled in ads hawking the Japanese-built Colt , such as this tortured one : " Made in Japan . Priced in America . " Agency : BBDO Detroit . <p> Eagle <p> #### <p> The surprise stand-out ads of the ' 90 model year return even better than before . TV ads turn into twin pitches - two consecutive 15-second spots that manage the tricky task of being both hilarious and hard-selling . " Eagle Talon TSi and Toyota Celica All-trac both have all-wheel drive . But the Celica costs about $ 4,000 more , " a man says in one TV ad . " What do those guys at Toyota take us for ? " an announcer asks . " About $ 4,000 , " the man replies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transform them into scripts of the TV ads - reinforcing the TV message . Agency : Campbell-Mithun- Esty Advertising . <p> Ford <p> ##1/2 <p> Straightforward , product-focused ads treat consumers like grown-ups , though they could use a tad more oomph . Thoughtful plays on words lend a nice touch : " Humming Bird " in a Thunderbird print ad , " Who says you have to be well-to-do to do it well ? " in a Tempo TV ad . Agency : J. Walter Thompson/Detroit . <p> Geo <p> ##1/2 <p> Ads make much of the fact that " more people chose Geo in its first year than Honda , Toyota and Nissan combined in their first two years . " No doubt the news will please Chevrolet dealers , who sell Geos . Consumers , though , probably will pay more attention to the way the ads emphasize low prices , roominess and fuel economy in a quiet yet confident manner . Agency : Lintas : Campbell-Ewald . <p> Honda <p> #### <p> Again , Honda 's ads are as good as its reputation . They 're understated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising . One Civic print ad shows it in the dictionary under " reliable . " - To tweak rivals targeting the top-selling Accord , ads show unseen forces firing arrows and darts - and missing . " Nice shot , " voice-over announcer Jack Lemmon says dryly as one arrow veers way off . Agency : Rubin Postaer &; Associates . <p> Hyundai <p> ## <p> Ads take a Honda wanna-be approach , copying the competition 's low-key style . " This car will do wonders for your image ( And ours. ) , " say ads for the new Scoupe sports coupe . One TV ad even starts off upside down , to dramatize that Scoupe is " so much fun , you may never look at Hyundai quite the same way again . " The danger is that the Honda-esque campaign will send shoppers to Honda showrooms instead of Hyundai 's . Agency : Backer Spielvogel Bates Inc . <p> Infiniti <p> ## <p> The rocks and trees from Infiniti 's ' 90 campaign are still around , but as bit players . Now , the cars are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Infiniti 's ads look too much like those of other luxury makes . If you 've seen one plush leather seat , you 've seen ' em all . The quiet tone of the TV ads does help to set them apart : " It 's said good things come to those who wait , " says an announcer in one ad for the G20 mid size sedan . " Good things also come to those who grab them with both hands . " Agency : Hill , Holliday , Connors , Cosmopulos . <p> Isuzu <p> ### <p> A worthy successor to Joe Isuzu is a new unnamed TV ad character who sets up wacky comparisons between Isuzu and rival carmakers . In one ad , he visits Easter Island to learn " what the gods think " of Isuzu Stylus vs . Toyota Camry . A mishap by the Camry driver sends the island 's famous statues into a chain-reaction collapse . And as for the Toyota 's higher price , " the gods are n't too crazy about that " either . Too bad the character is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , McNamee Inc . <p> Lexus <p> ##1/2 <p> Ads as rich as the cars they so elegantly hawk . The headline on a print ad says it all : " Fasten your cummerbund . " So when a TV ad brags , " You see , we do n't just promise you the sky , we deliver it , " it 's believable . Another TV ad - showing how city noises are silenced when you roll up the windows of an ES250 - is undercut by the superimposed word , " Simulation . " Agency : Team One Advertising . <p> Lincoln <p> ##1/2 <p> Another year of on-target upscale ads that compare Lincolns to other rewards of the good life such as trips on the Concorde , reserved parking spaces and truffles . TV ads touting quiet interiors offer a rare humorous touch : As a woman 's diamond brooch falls out of its box , an announcer says the Lincoln Town Car is " so quiet , you can hear a pin drop . " But another TV ad , with golfer Jack Nicklaus , falls short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Rubicam Detroit . <p> Mazda <p> ### <p> The classy feel of these ads makes Mazdas seem like they cost more than they do . A TV ad shows a man behind the wheel of a 929S , making " those split- second decisions every luxury-car driver needs to make . " At the end , he says into his car phone , " I 've thought about it . Let 's order pizza . " A print ad for the RX-7 tells you " how to improve the car that 's won more races than any other . ... Add a license plate . " Agency : Foote , Cone &; Belding . <p> Mercedes-Benz <p> ###1/2 <p> Superbly crafted ads , as usual , that concentrate on familiar themes . For safety , TV ads present an engineer reminiscing about crash tests 40 years ago , when he was " borrowing mannequins to use as test dummies and running energy-absorbing tests with tin cans from the cafeteria . " For snob appeal , a print ad displays 18 models : " Because people who custom-tailor their clothes should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Agency : McCaffrey &; McCall Inc . <p> Mercury <p> ### <p> Ads make a welcome move to a more sophisticated style in targeting younger buyers . A TV ad for the Sable says , " Tonight you 'll see 21 commercials for new cars . Remember that many of those cars have been inspired by the looks of this car . " A TV ad for Tracer shows a youthful man musing , " I thought the market would never hit 29 - or I 'd ever hit 30 . " Fun-filled ads for the Capri convertible urge you to " Think of it as a steel bikini . " Agency : Young &; Rubicam Detroit . <p> Mitsubishi <p> ## <p> The focus for ' 91 is on a new slogan : " The word is getting around . " So TV ads exaggerate to get across the idea that Mitsubishis are everywhere . One , set at a diner , shows scores of Galants driving up . Another says , " You see Eclipses all the time . " Such a strategy runs the risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Nobody goes there anymore , it 's too crowded . " Agency : Grey Advertising Inc . <p> Oldsmobile <p> #1/2 <p> " This is not your father 's Oldsmobile " is gone for good , though " The new generation of Olds " remains . So ads hammer " new " too hard . It gets to the point where everything Olds is new again - again and again . " At last , new and improved really mean something , " insists a print ad . " So what 's new with the new generation of Olds ? " asks a TV ad . Do n't ask . The ads could improve when celebrity-family ads return later this fall . Agency : Leo Burnett USA . <p> Plymouth <p> ##1/2 <p> These ads duplicate Dodge 's patriotic pitch , but add a key element missing from its sibling division 's messages : compelling reasons to pick Plymouth over competitive imports . Plymouth becomes " the American alternative " in head-to-head comparisons with Honda and Nissan . It 's a shame Plymouth did n't hang on to Tina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ads . Agency : Bozell Inc . <p> Pontiac <p> ##1/2 <p> The high point is a clever twist to some of the TV ads , in which smart- alec experts get shown up by excited Pontiac drivers . One is even risque , by staid General Motors standards : After a stuffy economist says , " The market for exciting things will be quite bearish , " a young woman in a Sunbird GT shouts , " Bullish ! " Other TV ads suffer by comparison , such as a cliched attempt to liken a ride in a Grand Prix to a ride in a jet . Agency : D'Arcy Masius Benton &; Bowles . <p> Saab <p> ###1/2 <p> Unusually tough , confrontational ads take on rival makes with a vengeance . One print ad calls Saabs " the cars the automobile establishment either ca n't build , or wo n't . " Another declares " the end of the selfish car . " A safety pitch even takes a head-on approach : TV and print ads show a smashed-up Saab 9000 " that surrendered its own life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thomas , Hedge Inc . <p> Toyota <p> ### <p> Toyota takes the high road in mature , level-headed ads packed with product benefits . The familiar Toyota leap-of-joy even puts in a few appearances . Offputting , though , is a TV ad silly enough to advise , " So do n't worry , be happy you 've got a Camry . " And a TV ad for the new Tercel strikes a false note when a twentysomething guy says , " We may not have all the right answers , but we 've found the right car . " Yeah , right . Agency : Saatchi &; Saatchi DFS Pacific . <p> Volkswagen <p> ###1/2 <p> The unlikeliest ad catch phrase since " That 's a spicy meatball " is back for another lighthearted go-round . " A Mrs. Susan Amato of Teaneck , N.J. , writes , ' I really want a Volkswagen Jetta , but what exactly does Fahrvergnugen look like ? ' " says an announcer in a TV ad . A print ad provides a rough translation : " ' It 's my turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headline on another print ad : " The new Passat . It 's a hug you give your family while having an exhilarating experience of your own . " How do you say " Huh ? " in German ? Agency : DDB Needham Worldwide . <p> Volvo <p> #### <p> Volvo 's longtime selling points of safety and durability get incredibly fresh and creative executions . For instance , TV and print ads show a sonogram revealing the outline of an infant . The only words : " Is something inside telling you to buy a Volvo ? " Perhaps the best of the best are TV and print ads revisiting a car-crushing exhibition last June in Austin , Texas . When a monster truck named Bear Foot runs over a row of cars , all are demolished except a Volvo 240 . The crowd boos . " Apparently not everyone appreciates the strength of a Volvo , " says the ad announcer . Agency : Scali , McCabe , Sloves Inc . <p> Yugo <p> ### <p> The beleaguered car begins its long-shot comeback attempt with an attention-grabbing TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With 357 improvements to the new Yugo , we 're going to take one and shake it till something comes loose , " says an announcer . And shake it they do - via a giant contraption that turns a red Yugo upside down . And what falls out ? A quarter from between the seats . Agency : Buckley/DeCerchio Inc . CUTLINE : Hyundai . Yes , Hyundai . CUTLINE : Stuart Elliott Elliot has covered advertising and marketing for USA TODAY since 1988 . CUTLINE : BLOWING THEIR OWN HORNS : Auto makers unveil new ads to kick off model year . Clockwise from top , Lexus , Saab , Oldsmobile , Eagle and Volvo tout their models .
