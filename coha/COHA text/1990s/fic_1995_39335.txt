WHEN MY SISTER Eleanor was in the third grade , she memorized Matthew 17:20 , about faith " the size of a mustard seed . " Ellie liked the idea of relocating mountains . One night at dinner , she speared a lima bean with her fork , lifted it toward her mouth and stared at it , her eyes dark enough to entertain magic or sadness . My eyes were always a simple blue . <p> " What 's the matter , Eleanor ? " Mom asked . <p> " If I had the faith of a lima bean , " Ellie said slowly , " I could do anything . " Two years younger than Eleanor , I already believed she could . <p> That summer , Ellie became a magician . We made her a black cape to wear over her favorite overalls . Ellie had perfect posture , while I slumped , never quite comfortable with my height . <p> I was the magician 's assistant . Eleanor gave me a suit , a piecemeal of Dad 's wardrobe . We raided the Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ellie wanted to drape tree lights around my shoulders for our grand finale , but Mom drew the line at electricity . <p> One of my jobs was procuring props . I had to ask Dad for spare change to replace the nickels and dimes we lost practicing our coin trick . " I do n't know about this magic stuff , Joe , " Dad said , handing me nickels . " Just remember the biggest magic trick is nothing compared to God 's tiniest miracle . " <p> " I 'll remember , " I promised , never guessing how badly I 'd come to need a miracle for my sister , the magician . <p> Ellie traded in her magic tricks for soft-lead pencils charcoals and watercolors . By her 13th birthday , every square inch of blank paper seemed rich with promise in my sister 's hands . Ellie painted scenery for the Christmas program the next year . Her star of Bethlehem would have led the most doubtful wise man straight toward Jesus . <p> THEN ELEANOR began to change . She would n't paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her room , refusing to talk to anybody . Mom said Ellie was having growing pains on the inside . The spells lasted only a few days , then Eleanor would be her old self . We got used to the rhythms of my sister 's emotions . <p> All through high school , her moods were like high and low tides . I was more like sand , shifting and resettling and waiting . <p> On her good days , certain things still held magic for Ellie . One night the summer before she left for college , we decided to sleep out in the back field . The moon was as narrow as a thumbnail clipping when Eleanor grabbed my Dad 's old kerosene lantern and I followed her , carrying pillows and Hershey bars and our old transistor radio . <p> We hung the lantern on a lonely fence post , climbing into our sleeping bags right away even though it was n't cold . Eleanor emptied her overall pockets of the stuff she 'd collected that day . Mom said Ellie was a natural-born scavenger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else seemed to . Ellie slipped colors and shapes into her pockets , and carried their secrets for days . They solved a piece of some mystery for her . <p> Eleanor fished a set of copper measuring spoons from her pocket and dangled them between us . " Mom was looking for these this morning , " I said . Ellie grinned , stacking a couple of pillows together and leaning back . " She probably just wanted to measure something with them . " She held the spoons up overhead and studied each one separately , tracing the curves with her fingers . <p> I settled down beside my sister , trying to see what she saw . " What are you doing ? " <p> " Trying to find the right one . " She compared two . " I think it 's this one . Turn the lantern down , Joe , " she whispered . <p> I scooted out of my sleeping bag and crawled toward the light . <p> " Not so dark you ca n't see me , " Eleanor said . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I can see you . " <p> " Remember when we were little and we pretended Mom 's measuring spoons were really a ring of keys that turned on our tricycles ? " <p> I nodded . I 'd forgotten , but I believed Eleanor . My sister pointed toward heaven . " I used to think the stars were tiny silver tacks to hold up secret messages from God . " <p> I liked the sound of Ellie 's voice and the way the lantern light stuttered across her face when the breeze picked up . I squinted up at the sky . I tried imagining it as a huge bulletin board , and I scanned it for a message with my name on it . <p> " Maybe the sky is a door and the moon is a keyhole . " Eleanor held the spoon high and tuned it slowly . " This spoon could unlock the whole sky . It fits . " She studied me . " We knew the spoons were keys , but we forgot . " <p> " You did n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even colors , " Eleanor said softly . Then she asked me to turn the lantern off . Ellie was quiet for so long , I started to drift off to the lullaby of breezes through the tall grass . " Sometimes I have to name colors , just to remind myself the world is n't all gray , " Ellie said . Then in a whisper , " Cyan , turquoise , magenta , slate , aqua , tangerine , emerald , quince , tyrian ... " I fell asleep to my sister 's words , quick , crooked brush strokes across my pale heart . <p> ELEANOR HAD been away at college a few weeks when her roommate called . Ellie had stopped going to classes . She did n't paint or draw , and she would n't talk to anyone . Dad drove over and brought Ellie home . <p> The next few days were doctor visits , counseling sessions and my parents ' late-night whispers . One night , long after I should have been asleep , I stood in the hallway listening to my parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychologist both agree , " Mom said . " They think Eleanor has a biochemical problem . Dr. Stephens thinks an antidepressant might really help . " <p> " We 'll take her to another doctor , " Dad said . <p> " Please , Harvey ? At least consider it . " <p> " You know how I feel about that . " My father 's voice was emphatic . <p> " I know you love Eleanor , " Mom whispered . " Please . Harvey , at least talk to the doctor . " I could n't breathe , with my mother 's voice making the air so thick and sad , so I went down the hall to bed . <p> Everybody at church prayed for my sister . I prayed hard for Eleanor , too , though I was n't sure what to ask for . Some nights , I 'd be in bed , listening to the quiet sadness of our house , and I 'd think if I could just figure out the right words to say to God we 'd all be OK again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was grateful for the way the congregation embraced Ellie so gently and quietly . She smiled and seemed really to try to make conversation , but on the way home in the car she closed her eyes and pressed her forehead into the passenger window . " Everyone was so nice ... but my heart is so tired , " she said , and my mother started to cry . <p> NOT LONG after that , Ellie stopped coming out of her room during the day . Then she would n't get dressed . Within a few weeks she was spending all day in bed , pulling herself deeper under the covers , her old blue bedspread like a tide drawn slowly away from the shore but not returning . <p> Ellie 's eyes were puffy almost every morning when I 'd go in to tell her good-bye on my way to school . One Saturday , I brought her a piece of toast and some pineapple juice , her favorite . I sat on the edge of her bed like company , not knowing what to say . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I miss the colors , " she said , her voice trembling . " Everything looks gray , like old pavement . " <p> " Do n't be scared , " I told her , because I was . <p> That night , Daddy finally agreed to the medication but my sister refused . Ellie said she did n't need pills , just time . Mom kept at her until she decided the arguments were just making Eleanor worse . I did n't know what to say . I just knew my sister was in trouble . <p> Eleanor had n't left her bed in six days the night I heard her sobbing . I climbed out of bed and stood just inside my open door . I 'd been afraid to close my door at night since Ellie had gotten so bad . I closed my eyes and heard my mother 's voice , so soft I followed it . <p> Mom was on the edge of my sister 's bed . Ellie leaned across her , my mother gathering as much of my sister into her lap as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing can separate us from the love of God , Eleanor . " Mom 's voice was swollen with tears . She repeated the same thing over and over . Ellie just sobbed , clinging to Mom . <p> Sometimes people repeat things because they do n't really believe what they 're saying , but Mom believed what she told Eleanor . Those words gave her heart enough weight to anchor my sister . <p> THE NEXT morning , Eleanor was curled in the middle of her bed asleep . She looked small and sinking , like an island being quietly swallowed . I tiptoed in and knelt beside my sister 's bed . Eleanor opened her eyes and I knew right then that the sadness was inside her , an illness like the doctor told Mom . I knew , because Ellie did n't need a minute to wake up to remember her hurt . This sadness remembered itself . " It 's bad , Joe , " Eleanor whispered . <p> " Please try the medicine , Eleanor . It might help . " <p> " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied the bottle of tiny , deep green pills , wondering how something so small could help such huge pain . " You only have to swallow them . You have faith in God . " <p> " I do n't think I have enough faith left . " <p> " Not even a lima bean 's worth ? " I tried to smile . <p> Eleanor shook her head , her eyes watery . " I 'm too tired . " <p> I did n't know what to say . My eyes searched Eleanor 's room . All the magic tricks had become as useless as burnt-out sparklers , and the colors had been put away . Then I noticed a slender , black , felt-tipped marker lying on Ellie 's desk . I stood and picked up the pen , crossing the room to the farthest yellow wall . I made a tiny mark somewhere near the center . <p> " What are you doing ? " <p> " Drawing you a mustard seed . " <p> " I ca n't see it . " <p> " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marker back on Ellie 's desk . " I promise you it 's there . " <p> It took a lot of convincing and another conference with Dr. Stephens to get Ellie on the medication . She was afraid it would n't work , afraid she would n't be able to paint anything , afraid of losing herself . I was a little scared , too . I did n't want Eleanor to forget her own magic . At first , Ellie still slept a lot . The doctor had warned us the medication might make her groggy for a while . Then one afternoon I came home and heard my sister moving around in her room . " I think Ellie 's up , " I told Mom . <p> " I know . " Mom touched my shoulder . " I think she 's better , Joe . " Hope ached in her voice . <p> THE FOLLOWING Saturday , I woke early . The house was quiet . Ellie 's door was ajar so I peeked in . She was standing across the room , painting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangle of mint-green vines and leaves grew slowly from her paintbrush . Then I slipped back out into the hall . <p> Later that week , Eleanor started eating dinner with us again . When Daddy said grace , he thanked God for " all those present at our table . " <p> I said " Amen " in two drawn-out syllables , like a TV preacher , and Ellie laughed . <p> I do n't know when Ellie 's wall began to bloom . I do n't know if the purple flowers or the yellow or the blue came first . By the time I saw it , the wall was a jungle of bright blooms and hopeful buds . Eleanor was asleep when I crept in to get a better look . <p> Ellie 's mural was like one of those hidden picture puzzles we used to find in our Sunday school newsletters . You had to look at them a new way every time to find the fishing net or disciple 's sandal or wayward sheep . <p> I did n't see Ellie and me until my focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the leaves . Our fingers tangled like twigs , through blue and orange and purple flowers . My eyes traced emerald vines trailing down and around our shins like Maypole streamers . Ellie and I stood barefoot , our feet tangled together with lima beans sprouting everywhere . <p> H.J. Duffy is a free-lance writer in Livingston , Texas . <p>
