IMPEACHING A CHIEF EXECUTIVE IS A DEADLY SERIous matter , so it would have been understandable if Brazilians had felt dejected after the lower house of Congress ousted President Fernando Collor de Mello . Instead , the country exploded into cheers and celebrated the impeachment as a victory for democracy . Before the Congress building in Brasilia , a crowd of 100,000 , many of them young people , hugged and danced . <P> &lt; The impeachment vote in the Chamber of Deputies was a lopsided 441 to 38 . Collor is suspended for up to six months , during which the Senate will try him on charges of corruption . Vice President Itamar Franco , a longtime Senator , became Acting President . Collor did not appear publicly after the vote , but Justice Minister Celio Borja said the President took the news " with great dignity . " He said Collor does not plan to step down permanently unless the Senate finds him guilty , an outcome most political leaders now think is inevitable . In fact , Collor 's trials may not end in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal charges of corruption and malfeasance . <P> It is the first presidential impeachment in Brazil 's 103-year history as a republic . The country had held high hopes for Collor , 43 , who was elected in 1989 on an anticorruption platform . But last August a special congressional commission found strong evidence that Collor had accepted $6.5 million from a slush fund operated by his former campaign fund raiser . Now the country 's hopes  --  well founded so far  --  are for an orderly transition of power .
