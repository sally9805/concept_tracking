The Mexican Mother Meets the Oldest Living Virgin of Manila <p> Queridisimo Doctorcito : Thank you for the foetus you sent me . The baby boy . Would you say I was a jazz poem , spit from the mouth of a saxophone ? Or would you send me straight to hell ? Pensamiento , pentimento , pimiento . . . Can you believe my mother is dead ? And her twin sister ? And my father , too ? All within a matter of months , yet none of them liked each other . Here , then , my grocery list of fickle desires . Once again , I am . Your monkey . Your Frida . <p> Reddish-purple : Aztec . Old blood of prickly pear . The most alive and oldest color . <p> Black : Nothing is black . Really , nothing . <p> His story . Her story . I lose patience with the obvious and dench my fists . Imagine . Lim Ah Hong . Big Wong . Manong . All wrong . What my Mexican mother said before she died : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not tolerate morphine . Forty years later , my Chinese brother says to my brother : Oh , you Filipinos . You love us , you hate us , you kidnap us . But you ca n't live without us . <p> Here 's another version : " Oh , you Filipinos . Ca n't stop dreaming about us . Blame us , love us , hate us , kidnap our children , and kill us . Burn our houses down . . . . But you ca n't live without us . " <p> Here 's my version : " Oh , you Filipinos . You so fucked up . " <p> What to do when the English no longer makes sense ? Ay , puta . Ay naku . Buwisit . Putang ina mo . Que asco . Que barbaridad . Que horror . <p> Imagine . It is 1963 and I have just arrived here . You are still sitting on a mound of dirt over there , watched over by lesuits . We curse in Tagalog , Spanish , English , Fukkienese , Mandarin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , terrified . You are not born yet . It is 1963 . Soon , Kennedy and then Malcolm X will be assassinated . Does America live up or down to my expectations ? Is it the Hollywood of our colonized imaginations ? You are born . The Vietnam War is finally over . I am mistaken for a pachuca in high school . You pachuco pachuca chicana greaser girl ? Yeah , I say . <p> Sure . <p> What is a Filipino ? Kinda like a Mexican , I say . But not really . How about this image : we 're small-time gangsters who can dance . Yo-yo champions of the world . Is n't that an easy one for you to access ? Oh , they say disappointed . But . You speak English so well . How did you learn so much , swimming from island to island ? <p> It is 1984 and you 've just arrived . I do n't know you yet , but we 've met somewhere before  --  over there , I 'm sure . I already know what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head . Images that recur burn up the screen . Let us begin . <p> A woman nailed to a cross . Contrary to popular opinion , she is not bleeding . <p> A woman suspended in a red void . Her daughters float in the sky above her . She reaches out , her legs spread , the palms of her hands up in a gesture of . . . supplication ? beseeching ? blessing ? Is she screaming or laughing ? She is childless but imagines her children into existence . A profane , immaculate conception . <p> One daughter wears a red dress , as red as the red void in which her mother is suspended . The other daughter is a baby , a naked peach , a fierce olmec cherub . Like her sister in the scarlet dress , like her mother has taught her from the womb , the floating baby 's eyes are shut in a constant dream . Her tiny , terrifying teeth are bared in a sly jaguar grin . She is beautiful . Her sister in the bloody dress is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the mother 's twin , a woman from Alhambra shrouded in black velvet . <p> Her glass bangles make too much noise , and the baby almost wakes up . " Look what you 've done , " the twins accuse each other . <p> The mother 's legs scissor the red horizon . Her back splits open , magnolia , plumeria , and calla lilies unfurl on her broken spine . Her flesh a map of scars . A map of the universe . Manong , manong . Walk the dog . Stand still . Big Wong . What went wrong ? <p> Dear Doctorcito . Find a soft spot , what 's left of my skin , and inject . There . There . She has learned that what is possible is often not visible . She 's a monkey . She devours bananas , crackers , and cheese . She pours hot wax on her bald , bent head . She howls even when she sleeps . She 's a scammer , a thief , the queen of self-pity , the Empress of Sorrow . She paints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio , the telephone , the bed , the plates , the silver . Midasina , Medea , Medusa . Jump cut . The twin sister poet holds up a tube of red lipstick . The mother sister puckers her lips . Find a soft spot . There . There . Mother , sister , daughter , daughter , sister , sister , niece , aunt . Twin . There are too many women in this house . A cluster of spikes , not snakes . The woman nailed to a cross grows bored with the nails embedded in her palms , embedded in her beautifully manicured feet . There is no blood . The nails are brand-new , rustproof . Dipped in hydrogen peroxide before being hammered in . She grows bored with her anguish , screeches with rage and writhes for her salvation . Her children howl along with her , a chorus of thorns <p> " Somebody yank this shit out . " <p> There is too much light in the room . The movie abruptly ends . <p> Imagine . The Philippine landscape lit by a pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in a cemetery , a tropical burial ground made unholy by Christian generals , immortal tyrants , and their lacquered wives . Your mother 's ghost dances on a piano in a haunted house in Sarrat . Your father gasps for breath and jabs at the air with a knife . It is you he wants . Mine gasps foe air and weeps like a child in that hospital in Makati . Like yours , he 's been dying for years . Love him , hate him , burn his house down . <p> Your mother shrieks with joy : So much gold it lights up the night ! Our mothers . . . whose pleasures were Catholic , forbidden , and therefore fleeting . <p> Knock knock . Who 's there ? Emy . Emy who ? Emygrant . A diva I once knew defined motherhood as " the ultimate censorship . " On the telephone , I ca n't tell her voice apart from her daughter 's . It 's the main reason I do n't call her anymore . <p> Imagine . Delicious obsessions . You flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Magellan went looking for spices . All those mad Europeans went looking for spices . Their lives lacked chili pepper and heat , they longed for something they could not name , what was possible was not visible , so in the name of God &; the Fat Pale Queen they went sailing in search of gold , pepper , saffron , cinnamon , and souls . And here we are , the bastards of Discovery , quin-centennial years later ! You flew here on an airplane . You flew here in a rage . I sailed on a ship for an eternity of seventeen days to California , and shut my eyes to save myself and dream . Little Richard , Chuck Berry , Fats Domino . . . <p> Bad vibes back home . In my dream , the natives throw a fiesta but they smell something fishy . For once , they are n't buying into it  --  not the blue-eyed priest , not the startling skin , not the gold of the conquistador 's hair or the gold of his cross , not the smell or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1521 on the island of Mactan . The air stinks of paranoia , Spanish sweat , and death . No one 's feeling hospitable . Unlike Columbus , Magellan gets dissed , ambushed , and decapitated . WHACKED off by the tribal chief Lapu Lapu , Magellan 's head rolls on and on and on across the bloody sand of the beach and disappears into the salty Pacific ocean . <p> In the official version , the armor-suited Magellan is felled by arrows and left to die on the beach . But I like mine better . <p> How we remember . What we remember . Why ? Who ? What ? Where ? When ? Who ? Who else ? Who with ? Who said ? How ? How much ? With what ? With whom ? Where else ? Why ? Why ? Why ? Why is the cross of Magellan a tourist attraction in the Philippines ? Why is a scavenger fish named after Lapu Lapu in the Philippines ? <p> O Ferdinand , O Isabella , O Cristofer , O Cortez , O Lopez de Legaspi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , O Popes of manifest destiny . There was never enough gold to mine . This was never Peru , and all you found was cinnamon . <p> Wrong again . It is 1941 and I 'm in my casita azul . I 'm wearing your pants and smoking a cigarette . It 's one I rolled myself , I 'm terrible at rolling anything  --  the tobacco keeps falling out , the paper is soaked with saliva , and I keep having to relight the cigarette . But I look good , do n't I ? A pensive pose  --  kalachuchi flower stuck in my thick black hair . . . dead center , so you ca n't miss it in the photograph . The one where I stand next to Trotsky . Somber yet stunning . Just so , how I lean against the wall of my little blue house of skulls . <p> Did you decide early on if you were ugly or pretty ? Were you considered a barrio beauty ? You have to choose  --  it helps you endure . Filipinos know how to endure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I decided early on that I was magnificent . I smoked my cigars , I wore my rustling skirts with their layers of ostentatious ruffles and itchy lace , I was Diego 's sequined monkey bride with my sunflower headdress instead of a veil . The starched rays of my Tehuantepac crown jutting out from the sides of my head . I was your mother , goddammit , the leopard queen bitch of kitsch . I nag you from my grave , in my eternal agony glorious still . <p> And where are Dolores , Bessie , and Perlita ? La Chinita Anna May ? El maldito Nelson Rockefeller ? And that fucking Maria Felix . . . how dare she outlive me ! <p> Dear Doctorcito : I 'm wearing my motorcycle jacket . The one that 's black and smells of skin . Caimito de Guayabal is perched on my shoulder . Sweet monkey . I ape the ape Caimito , I 'm your monkey perched on a pew .

Mother . Bless your little monkey for I have sinned . Sin verguenza , your Jessica . <p> Dear Doctorcito . I want a shave , please . Give me a close shave . Do n't shave me too close . I am very thin-skinned . <p> Everything you made up is true . My brother exists . He 's a twentieth-century zealot on lithium , ranting the scriptures in Tagalog and English to anyone who listens . No one does . Cobalt blue : electricity , pure love . <p> I 'm a nun on fire , I wear your baggy pants , I 'm Diego in love . Rub my rotunda of a belly 3x for good luck . On your knees , you hobble like a cripple from one station of the cross to the other . There are exactly fourteen . Take your time . Do n't ask too many questions . Keep the faith . The church is our mother fucker , this abstract menage a trois a sacred passion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are you disappointed ? Have your dreams and ways of speaking become too precise and American ? <p> Dear Doctorcito : Some say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino . Some say the Chinese . Why do they always say the Chinese ? Some say it once was a jungle weapon . Even the French have tried claiming it as theirs . In English , yo-yo connotes flakiness . The back and forth motion of indecision . A toy . In Spanish , yo-yo means " I , I. " I read somewhere that in Tagalog , yo-yo means " to return . " <p> Beware of yellow .
