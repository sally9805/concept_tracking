I saw my first ghost when I was nine years old , only I did n't know it was a ghost at the time . This was on the Great Plains , in South Dakota , I think , on our way to the Black Hills . I was with my mother , my three-year-old sister , Lillie , and my new stepfather , Forrest Bender , who was a Sioux Indian . He had stopped the car  --  in his careful way , making sure the trailer was well off the road  --  so he could read a historical marker , one of the small cast-iron plaques the federal government places on the sides of interstates . This was something Forrest was forever doing , he could n't let even one go by , and my mother was beginning to resent it more and more . <p> " We can have lunch here , " he offered , wading out into the grass and waving his arms around him . <p> " We 'll never get there at this rate , " my mother said . Forrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance . <p> " Sometimes the journey is as important as the destination , " he said solemnly . <p> " Who said that ? " she snapped at him . <p> He looked back at her , puzzled , then a smile took over his face . " I did , " he said . " Just now . " <p> " Oh , please , " my mother said . " Spare me . " <p> We all knew what she thought . Her use of the phrase had taken on new significance since the time  --  just a few weeks before  --  when she 'd found a bottle of whiskey he 'd stashed in the trunk , in the spare-tire wheel well . <p> But he wandered off in the other direction , to the plaque . " On this site in April of 1876 a train of 82 Conestoga wagons from Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , was attacked by a Sioux war party , " Forrest read out to us . " All 228 settlers were killed in what has become known as the Pettibone Massacre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The perfect place for a picnic . " She was anxious to get to Seattle , where she was going to start a new job , working as an administrator at a drug rehabilitation center . It had been her idea that , for the sake of Lillie and me , we stop at some historical landmarks along the way  --  Mt . Rushmore and Yellowstone , in particular  --  to make up for the fact that we would be out of school ( pre-school , in Lillie 's case ) . But my mother had n't counted on Forrest 's diligence . <p> " This is some real American hist'ry , " he told her now . I was beginning to like the singsong of his speech , the way he pronounced Amur'can . He slapped his belly and let out a war whoop . " Hoka hey ! " he said . In the vast , open space his voice seemed to carry off and disappear . " Hoka he ! My people . " <p> " Look , Cochise , " my mother said , " let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . " Lillie and I looked at each other , knowing our mother was nearing the end of her patience . We 'd moved around a lot when it was just the three of us , going from rental to rental , neighborhood to neighborhood . It always seemed to make my mother a nervous wreck , but this was worse than usual . Her weird sense of humor was leaving her ; she 'd dropped her nicknames for us , stopped calling us Disney-man and Lillie-Belle . She was becoming more and more stern and jittery and tight-lipped the farther we got from St. Paul , which we 'd never left before . <p> She reached into the Corvair  --  even then it seemed a hundred years old  --  and yanked out the old army blanket she always kept in the back seat , then strutted off into the grass at the roadside . " Walt , get the cooler from the trunk , " she told me as she unfurled the blanket and spread it out on the grass . <p> " I 'll get it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told Walter to do it , " my mother said . <p> " It 's okay , " he said to me , stopping to ruffle my hair with his pudgy fingers . " Go sit with your mother . " <p> " I told Walter , " my mother repeated . <p> Forrest 's fingers stopped in place on my head , then fell down to my shoulder as he must have realized my mother 's suspicions . Through my T-shirt I could feel the roughness of his hand , from his last job digging ditches for a pipe-laying outfit . " Okay , okay , " he said . He handed me the keys then went over to where my mother sat on the blanket and sat down cross-legged next to her with a sheepish smile . <p> I climbed over the hitch where the boxy U-Haul was connected to the car . It held all our possessions . After my mother 's giant yard sale , we did n't have much to move . Forrest was tickling Lillie and her laughter peeled across the grass as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself up and plopped Lillie in place on the blanket while my mother distributed lunch . Nobody said anything more as we sat there and ate our sandwiches . The silence seemed sudden . There were no other cars on the highway . There was only the sound of our chewing , and then , eventually , of the wind rustling the grass , and the trill of an occasional killdeer as they shot up from the thickets along the roadside , their long tails pluming behind . <p> " They look like arrows , " Forrest eventually said . He said this as if talking to himself , the way he did , like a narrator to an unseen audience . He leaned toward me , but spoke out toward the grassland rolling to the horizon . " Imagine a blanket of arrows , flying out of the clouds of dust , the wasichus shooting back into the clouds . That was all they could do . " <p> " What 's wazychoos ? " Lillie asked him . <p> Forrest smiled and mussed her hair . " White people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of blon ' blockheads , like in Minnesota . " <p> I looked at the tall grass around us and tried to imagine the people from St. Paul there , with wagons and horses , and maybe hats . <p> Forrest said , " They wou' n't have been able to kill them all like that , though , with the wagons like a fort . They would have had to charge into them  --  screaming like banshees  --  and then killed them by hand , with hatchets and dubs . Then they would have sliced the tops of their heads off , for the scalps . Little babies , too . " <p> " For God 's sake , " said my mother , slapping her half-eaten sandwich down on its cellophane wrapper . " That 's it . " She grabbed up the remains of her sandwich and threw it into the cooler . " Let 's go . " She stood and snatched what was left of Lillie 's sandwich , then mine , and threw them into the cooler , too . Then she stormed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled his attention back and looked after her . He seemed unperturbed . " It 's this place , " he confided to me . " She feels it . When something like that happens , it leaves something behind . Fear and killing . . it leaves something in the ground . There are spirits here . " <p> I looked around again . I remember thinking I could hear a pounding , like a heartbeat , a muffled drumbeat like a TV sound track when the Indians appear on the ridge . I could sense them , just beyond the crest of grass , coming at any minute to cut the top of our heads off . There was a sudden thump and I leapt to my feet , ready to run . Then I realized it was only my mother , slamming her car door . <p> Still , I kept a keen eye on the rising wave of grass and stuck close to Forrest as I waited nervously for him to collect our things . " What did they look like ? " I asked him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees , calmly finished packing the cooler and put it under his arm . Then he stood next to me and paused to look out at the hummock of grass . <p> " They were n't very han'some , " he said , " not like in movies . They were mostly naked , and greasy . They looked silly sitting on their little ponies with their legs sticking out . Some of them were fat . " <p> He handed me the cooler and squatted down to gather up the blanket . <p> " Like you ? " I asked as I turned and stumbled in my hurry to get back to the car . I thought Forrest was right behind me . <p> He laughed and I turned to see he was still standing off in the grass . " Maybe , " he said . He flapped the blanket in the air to clean it off . " Prob'ly . Sure , like me , " and he laughed again . <p> I stood nervously by the open trunk and watched him : a short , thick man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark against his khaki work shirt , standing out in the waving grass and the clear air flapping a blanket . But my eyes kept drifting past him , not really seeing him ; they were worrying , instead , the verge of grass . <p> My mother stuck her head out the window . " Close the trunk , " she told me . <p> I felt relieved when we drove away from that place , and watched the land slip away out the window as we accelerated , like we were making a getaway . Along the roadside , a killdeer shot out of the grass and fell back again , like an expended arrow . <p> When we 'd left St. Paul , we 'd stopped in the Minneapolis suburbs to say goodbye to my uncle Seth and his family Uncle Seth was my mother 's older brother , and on that visit I remember noticing for the first time how much he looked and acted like my mother . Everyone had always said how much alike they were , but no matter how hard I looked I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , finally , it felt like learning something , something about science , a subject I was having trouble with in school . It was like getting my eyes to work better , my senses becoming more adult , like when I 'd finally come to understand what my mother meant when she asked me if something tasted salty , or sweet or sour . <p> It made me wonder about my own sister , too , as I watched Lillie in the backyard . I was trying to follow my mother 's directions to keep her from getting into trouble with Uncle Seth 's two boys , who were five and six and wild . My mother called them " Irish twins , " a joke I did n't understand but knew was directed at Uncle Seth 's schoolteacher wife , Colleen . <p> I took the opportunity to try and teach Lillie some more of the expressions I 'd picked up at school , all the while wondering if we mirrored each other , too , without knowing it . I wanted to see her mimicking me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I tried to teach her to say , " No way , Jose . " But Lillie would n't pay attention , she kept trying to pull away to chase after Uncle Seth 's boys . I would grab her and pull her back , but she kept coughing in my face and giving me a hard time . <p> When I saw Uncle Seth and my mother go off on the side together , just before we were supposed to leave , I 'd abandoned Lillie to spy on them , hiding nearby behind one of the elm trees , dead from the blight . Lillie scooted off happily , her pudgy little legs and arms churning , her coughs coming like small barks as she raced madly after my cousins . Uncle Seth glanced at Forrest  --  who was off in the driveway checking the fluids in the car  --  as if to make sure he was out of earshot . I stared at my mother and tried to imagine her with short hair and a deeper voice , in a flannel shirt and work boots like Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I heard Uncle Seth say to her . <p> " No it 's not , " she said back . " Nothing 's ever worked for me here . I 've got to start over again . " <p> " But you 're driving clear across the country . " <p> " A new place , a new start , " my mother said . " And it 's a good job . " <p> " It 's a depressing job , " Uncle Seth said . " And what is this guy ? " He nodded off toward where Forrest was visible , bent under the hood of the car . " Practice ? Another one of your projects . " Uncle Seth knew my mother had met Forrest at the soup kitchen . She was a volunteer . He was on line . <p> " How dare you  --  " my mother said . <p> " You married him so quickly , you do n't even know him . He 's a drunkard . You want him around the kids like that ? " <p> " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother said , tucking her chin down , her voice seeming to get quieter and hotter at the same time . " He 's had some bad luck , just like I have . We 're both trying to make a change . I know what I 'm doing . " <p> Uncle Seth tucked his chin down , too . " This is no change , " he said , " except that you 're gon na be a thousand miles away from your family and friends . Sure , you 've got a job , but what about him ? Believe me , Kat , this guy is no change . " <p> " I know what I 'm doing , " my mother said again , turning on her heel and moving off to scoop up Lillie as she came speeding by . Lillie 's legs kept churning for a moment , like a toy whose wheels keep spinning when you lift it off the floor . My mother slung her over one hip and went and stood next to Forrest , who straightened up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother a squeeze , then took Lillie and lifted her up onto his shoulders . <p> Lillie grabbed his ponytail and held it so it stuck up from his head , splayed like a feather . <p> " Ready ? " Forrest asked my mother . <p> Lillie dropped Forrest 's ponytail , grabbed his collar like reins , and kicked at him with her little sneakers . " Giddy-up ! " she said . " Giddy-yup , giddy-yup ! Ride ' em , cowboy ! " <p> Uncle Seth wandered over slowly , examining the ground , then he studied the car . He kicked a tire , rubbed a hand on the fender . Then he turned to face my mother and shrugged . Both of them dropped their shoulders then and moved to each other and hugged tightly . I watched from behind the dead elm , my cheek pressed against the bark , until they called me . <p> That night , when we finally set up camp in the Badlands National Park , I thought how my mother was right about Forrest . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no school anymore . We were living in a tent now , cooking over fires . This had been Forrest 's idea . He said that this was a cheaper way to travel than staying in motels , and my mother had seemed relieved both at his thriftiness , and at finding out he was right . The rangers at the National Parks charged us only a few dollars to pitch the tent we 'd borrowed from Uncle Seth , and the campgrounds had bathrooms with running water . <p> My mother 's tension seemed to let up a bit as we cooked hot dogs over a fire and then sat there to stay warm . It was early autumn and the nights were getting chilly . " Oh boy , " she said . " Wilderness family . " <p> Forrest loved it . " I have n't done this in years ! " he said , looking around and stretching his arms out as if searching for something to embrace . He had been brought up in South Dakota on the reservation . " I 'm seven-eighths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't know what he meant by this , but math was another subject I did n't like so I did n't ask . Instead , over dinner I got him to tell Lillie and me stories about his ancestors , particularly about Crazy Horse . " Ah , Tasunke - Witco , " Forrest said . " He was my gran'father <p> " Right , " said my mother , laughing . " And my great-grandparents came over on the Mayflower . " <p> " They did ? " Forrest said . <p> " Squanto ! " I said , surprised to find something from school coming in handy . <p> " Squanto was a pretty good guy , " Forrest said . " But those Pilgrims put one over on him . He should not have trusted them . Crazy Horse would have slaughtered them . " <p> My mother 's mouth fell open , then she buried her head in her hands . <p> " What 's slottered ? " Lillie asked . <p> " He would have cut out their hearts , " Forrest calmly explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a precocious nod , as if this made complete sense to her . <p> My mother shook her head and looked up at the sky . " Must we ? " she asked the stars . Then she lowered her gaze back to Forrest . " She 's already sick . Do you have to keep her up all night with nightmares ? " <p> Lillie had kept up her coughing all day long . She was always sick , it seemed to me . <p> " I 'll go get the blankets from the car , " Forrest said . He got up , unwinding in one fluid motion  --  Forrest was not a man without grace  --  and went to the car . He was gone a long time . Lillie and I sat looking into the fire while my mother snapped a twig to pieces . <p> When Forrest came back he wrapped a blanket around Lillie and stroked her hair for a moment , tucking it into the blanket and making her giggle . Then he brought the rest of the blankets into the tent . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flap closed , and I could hear the fevered murmur of her voice , scolding him . <p> " I want more stories , " Lillie said . <p> I looked off at the strange shapes of the hills across the open space of the campground . The limestone formations circling us on one side were getting darker against the deepening blue of the sky . On the other side of us , the flat plain stretched off to a range of distant mountains . The first stars twinkled along their edges . Even as a kid , I knew this was a beautiful sight , and that the single lone billboard  --  placed out beyond what must have been the boundary of the park and lit up by a row of small spotlight  --  was some sort of desecration . It was for a private campground , and camp was spelled with a K This bothered me . Spelling was one thing I was good at . <p> " I do n't think so , " I told Lillie . " Shut up . " <p> After the Badlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could pass through the reservation where he 'd been born . " Maybe I 'll see somebody who remembers me , " he told my mother . <p> She was still irritable . " I thought you were a boy when you left , " she said . <p> " I was , " he said . " But you never know what will come back to you . " <p> Off the interstate , the two-lane blacktop passed through a clutter of billboards for things like " The World 's Biggest General Store Only 86 Miles , " or the " Bear in the Lodge Truck Stop With Real Buffalo Burgers . " One said , " Go Back You Missed the Petrified Gardens ! " <p> Then the billboards stopped and Forrest told us we were on the reservation . We passed a few farmhouses and some trailers with long , rust-pocked cars parked haphazardly in the dirt around them . Eventually , we stopped seeing any more signs of civilization at all , save for utility poles and fencing . Mostly it was just mile after mile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean man walking the other way along the shoulder . Forrest honked the horn and the man waved . Lillie and I hung out the side window and waved back until he was out of sight . Then we drove for miles more of empty grassland , until my mother said , " My God , we have n't passed a thing ! That man must be walking for miles ! " <p> " That 's what you do here , " Forrest said . <p> Eventually , we came upon a white clapboard church with a steeple , set far back off the road , and then some houses and another trailer or two , and then finally we came upon a sign for gas and a grocery store . We pulled off the road and into the lot , where there were several dumps of men standing around next to a scattering of pickups and old American cars , big and white and dirty , like the bellies of washed-up boats . <p> " You go and get some cough s'urp for Lillie , " Forrest told my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions . " <p> " This wo n't take long , " my mother said . <p> " Okay , " said Forrest . <p> She took Lillie and me into the store and stopped just inside the door to get her bearings . I noticed the women working the bank of cash registers . They looked like white women but , they had dark hair . I stared at them , trying to figure out if they were Indians or not , until my mother took my hand , and Lillie 's , too , and pulled us away . We wandered down one aisle , then up another . Lillie was n't paying attention , and when my mother paused to examine a tall stack of soup cans , Lillie walked into the back of her legs . An old woman , hunched up and wearing an unnecessarily heavy down vest , stopped as she was passing us to finger Lillie 's curly blond hair . " Very pretty , " she told my mother , smiling . " Your children are very good-looking . " <p> My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanked her primly and took up our hands again . We passed what looked like entire families , women and children and grandparents , shopping together . They all nodded and smiled at us , then resumed to carefully studying packages before placing them in their carts or back on the shelves . <p> When we came out Forrest was standing next to some old-fashioned gas pumps with glass bubbles on top . There were three or four men with him , wearing ragged straw cowboy hats and dirty denim clothes . They were passing a bottle in a greasy sack back and forth and laughing . One of them , an old man with fat round cheeks , kept touching Forrest , putting a hand on his arm , then taking it away , then putting it back again as they talked and laughed . <p> " We 're ready , " my mother called to Forrest from the car . <p> " Okay , " he said , then nodded at the men and came over and got back in the car with us . He was still chuckling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but before we could pull away the man who had been touching Forrest came up and leaned down into his open window . He smelled funny and had a few long black hairs coming out of the smooth skin around each end of his mouth . He was smiling , and it made the hairs stick out . <p> " Maybe you have a dollar you could give me , " he said to Forrest . <p> Forrest looked at my mother , who looked like she was about to speak , but no words came out . Then she looked down and around herself , shifting as she searched the seat for her purse . <p> But Forrest turned back to the man and said , " We do n't really have it to spare . " <p> " You sure ? " the man asked . His head was nearly completely in the car . His eyes were shining and looked like they were brimming with water . " One dollar ? " <p> My mother stopped her rustling and stared at the man in the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's all right , " the man said . He held the greasy sack out to Forrest . <p> " No thanks , " Forrest said . <p> " You sure ? " the man asked . A grin took over Forrest 's face , as if in spite of himself , and the man laughed . " Happy journey he said . Then he stepped back , smiling , and gave us a wave as we pulled away . <p> " Boy , " said my mother . <p> " He knew me , " Forrest said . " He knew my father . He called him Chief . Chief Bender . " ' Forrest laughed . " I told him my father was gone and he said , ' Then you are Chief now . " ' He slapped a hand on my mother 's thigh and fumed his head to all of us . " You can just call me Forrest , though , " he told us . <p> Back on the road , my mother was silent , staring out the window pensively as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep next to me with her mouth open . Forrest was humming happily , and he would point out things and comment on them to me in whispers . Even though our picnic stop had scared me a little , I was anxious for him to bring us to another place with ghosts . I sat up and stared closely at anything he pointed out , my head going all the way around and back to Forrest as we passed it . It was like it was just him and me for a while . <p> But we did n't pass any more of the little iron historical markers . Instead , the reservation 's highway signs were all homemade , green with hand-painted white letters in obvious imitation of the signs on the interstate . But these signs were wooden , and few and far between . There were just enough of them to tell you how far away from something you were , or how far you had to go to get someplace . <p> When we did , finally , pass a few historical markers , these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge sheets of plywood completely covered with long passages of small , cramped words . But Forrest did n't stop to read them . " I know what they say , " he told me whenever we passed one , and then he would recite the history of the place , what had happened there , who had died . <p> " Red Cloud died in that house , " he pointed out once , when we passed an old , ornate Victorian-style house half-hidden in a dump of pine and willow trees . " He was a very old man . He died all alone . He was a great chief , he won many battles , but the other Indians di' n't trust him because in the end he was frien'ly with the wasichus . " <p> I felt a tingle , as I had on our picnic , like it was n't hard to imagine something still there but not quite visible , like there was an old Indian  --  I saw him in a chiefs headdress , wrapped in a blanket , for some reason  --  lurking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signs , Forrest continued his breathy whistling or humming . My mother had kept her silence since the grocery store , and it began to seem strange . Good mood or bad , my mother was famous for always keeping up a determined stream of talk . She would even tell you what she was thinking , going on at length about simple errands , or her complex plans for the future . " I 'm thinking we ought to do this or that next , Disney-man , " she 'd announce , and then she 'd go on to explain it all in detail . Even when she seemed to have nothing on her mind , like when I 'd find her staring out a window , she would feel the need to explain . " In my mind , I 've gone to California , " she 'd say . <p> But she was silent now , lost in thought , and Forrest began to notice it , too . His music grew quieter , as if he did n't want to disturb her . After a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried to teach her to say , " Give me some skin , man , " and to put her hand out flat and let me slide my palm across hers . But she was irritable . She thought I was going to give her an Indian sunburn , which was something I 'd done to her when she was little ; I 'd take her wrist and hold it in place with one hand and twist her forearm with my other hand until I 'd worked the skin red and she was squirming . I had n't done this to her since Forrest came around , though . I sensed it was one of the things I should n't do around him , like talking about my real father . But Lillie did n't trust me , so she started coughing in my face again . I did n't like to teach her these things in front of anyone , anyway , because sometimes my mother would whack me for it and say , " Cut it . " So eventually we got quiet , too . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we were all surprised when my mother suddenly spoke . " Let 's go to that , " she said . It was the first thing she 'd said since the grocery store . <p> Forrest slowed down and looked at her . " You sure ? " he asked . <p> She looked at him . " Yes , " she said . " I 've heard about that place . " She turned around in her seat and mussed my hair , then sat back and put her hand casually on Forrest 's shoulder . She looked back out the window and said , " Maybe it 'll be educational . " <p> Forrest shrugged , and when we got to the exit he maneuvered the car carefully off the highway . The side road followed a small , deep-set , churning river , and the flat land dipped down with it . We were suddenly in rolling country that had been hidden from us . The river cut into a deep ravine , and we passed over it on a bridge made of wood and iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One road met another there , bending off in either direction , but Forrest pulled up next to the sign and stopped . Across the way was a hill , on top of which was a lonely church and a graveyard . It seemed like we were the only ones around for miles . <p> " This is it , " Forrest said . <p> My mother seemed surprised , and she looked at Forrest the same way I did as I asked , " No souvenir stand ? " <p> " Nope , " Forrest said . <p> When I think about that place now , I remember it as being early morning and gray , with fog creeping from the riverbank to collect along the foot of the hill and reach its ghostly tendrils up the sides , the tombstones seeming to lift up out of it . But Lillie , who claims she remembers things from the cradle , tells me it was midday and the sun was shining hot . <p> My mother got out and stood in the dirt , reading the sign , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back . I stood next to her and counted three misspellings before Forrest called to us to follow him up the hill . " Come on , " he said . " You can see it all from up here . " <p> Dreaming about it now , I see myself quiet and spooked , but I also remember complaining that I wanted a soda until my mother finally got annoyed and shushed me in a sudden burst of anger . Then she withdrew , going off to weave slowly and seemingly aimlessly through the headstones . Forrest trailed her with Lillie in his arms , her legs wrapped around his waist . <p> There were photographs on the markers , and I was surprised to see these were n't the graves of warriors with feather bonnets . The photos were mostly of people in what looked like school portraits , or young men posed in modem military uniforms . <p> " My God , " my mother said after a while , " they all look so young !

But he did n't seem at all daunted by her discovery . His lopsided smile was in place and he seemed as cheerful as ever . " Yes , " he said . " I am an old man , by Indian <p> Perhaps because I had become absolutely desperate for soda , this place did not evoke the ghosts for me of our picnic on the prairie , nor of Red Cloud hidden in the willows .

He told us about the soldiers across the ravine with Gatling guns , and Lillie said , " What 's catlinks ? " But that 's about it . At the time , there were no ghosts for me there . <p> My dreams now are scattered and colored by a wishfulness that I 'd been more perceptive then . My most vivid memory is of being a little surprised that my mother did not scold Forrest when he described all the dead children in the snow , their blood a satin blanket beneath them ; instead she thwacked me on the shoulder when I interrupted him to complain of my thirst . <p> And when we got back in the car and drove off , she looked out the window and rubbed her hands over her bare arms as if she had a chill . <p> For once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even more unusual than my mother 's , and in that way it gradually came to me that something had happened and that I had missed it .

Maybe she was thinking about the calm way Forrest could tell such a horrible story . I turned to look out the back window , but all I could see was the big , dull box of our possessions trailing along behind us , pulling on us whenever we tried to ascend a rise in the land , pulling on us like a great weight . <p> It was n't until we were in the Black Hills that the sense of something foreboding returned , and I could hear the Indian sound track again , and imagine them , stray and feathered and on horseback , in the pines on the rocky slopes . The tingling returned as the road unreeled , twisting and curving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs and places to stop , but they would disappear in moments and we would find ourselves climbing and winding our way through untouched and rugged landscape , being watched . <p> When we passed a sign saying " Crazy Horse Monument , " it seemed to confirm my feelings . <p> " Forrest !

" <p> " It 's nothing , " Forrest said to both of us . <p> " But Crazy Horse ! " I said , baffled as to why he was driving past the exit . <p> " It 's nothing , " he said , more to my mother than to me . " There is nothing to see . " <p> My mother was craning back over her shoulder , trying to read the sign from the back . <p> " It said Crazy Horse ! " I told her . <p> " It 's just a mountain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horse , " Forrest explained . " Like the whites did with Moun ' Rushmore . " <p> " You 're kidding , " my mother said . <p> " No , " Forrest said . " They 've been working on it since before I was born . But it only looks like a moun'ain that 's been blow 'd up . " He shook his head and smiled . " Bunch of dumb Indians , " he said . " They ca n't figure out how to blow up a moun'ain like the white man . " He chuckled , a low sound deep in his chest . <p> " But  --  " I started . <p> " God , " said my mother , straightening her frazzled hair . " No whining . " <p> " Trust me , " said Forrest . " It 's nothing . Crazy Horse woul' n't like it . " His shining black eyes smiled at me in the rearview . <p> But whether it was Crazy Horse or a blown-up mountain , both sounded like something I wanted to see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the little iron historical plaques , where there was never anything except grass , and not at a place where there was actually something to see . I folded my arms and slipped into a funk in the back seat . <p> The car moved slower and slower as we climbed up into the hills . We kept passing signs for Mt . Rushmore , but it never seemed to be arriving . My mother kept shifting in her seat and sighing . " This is taking forever , " she said . Lillie was coughing , saying , " How much longer ? " <p> In my mood , I decided to contribute . " I have to go to the bathroom , " I said . <p> " Do n't start , " my mother snapped back over her shoulder . <p> " I 'm not starting , " I told her . <p> " Yes you are , you 're starting , " she said . <p> " Are we almost there ? " Lillie asked . <p> My mother twisted in her seat to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . <p> Forrest clucked his tongue . <p> She turned to him like she was going to snap at him , too , but he merely nodded , indicating something in the comer of the windshield : the colossal head of George Washington had suddenly appeared through a crease in the mountains . <p> " Holy cow ! " my mother said . <p> George Washington vanished as quickly as he 'd appeared . The road circled the foot of a mountain , then cleared it , and suddenly , rising majestically before us , was another mountain on which we could see all four gigantic heads  --  Washington , Jefferson , Roosevelt , and Lincoln  --  carved into the sheer rock face . They were skirted by a wash of granite rubble left when they 'd been blasted out : a clean , gray apron of stone trimmed in pine . A perfectly white cloud drifted beyond in crystal blue sky . It was an amazing sight . <p> " Wow ! " I said , all thoughts of mood and ghosts gone . " Cool ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " they know how to blow up a moun'ain . " <p> When we got there we parked and made our way to the gate , unable to take our eyes off the sight  --  except for Lillie , who was whining in my mother 's arms . But my mother paid no heed , she was transfixed , although after Forrest paid the entrance fee she did manage to mutter , " So expensive . . . " under her breath . <p> " I 'm hungry ! " Lillie complained . <p> " Shush , baby , " my mother cooed , barely distracted . <p> " I 'm very hungry ! " Lillie persisted . <p> " What are you hungry for ? " my mother asked . <p> " I need candy , " Lillie said . <p> " Oh , " my mother said . " No you do n't . " So Lillie coughed wetly in her ear . My mother wiped it off unconsciously and resumed her trance , staring off through the enormous windows of the visitor 's center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we got there I had to thump at my mother 's side to get her attention . I wanted some quarters for the binocular machines . <p> She dug out some change mechanically , and I slipped in a coin , but it took me a few minutes to figure out how to work the viewer . My mother and Forrest were no help at all as they stood there in stunned wonderment . But it seemed like as soon as the viewer whirred to life , my mother was pressing up next to me . " Let me see , " she said . <p> I pushed her back without taking my eyes from the lenses . " Wow ! " I said . " Can we go up there ? " I was imagining climbing around on Lincoln 's nose . <p> My mother gave me a firmer nudge and took over the machine , shifting Lillie onto her hip . <p> " I do n't think so , " Forrest said . <p> " I need candy ! " Lillie said , whacking the side of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyepiece . <p> " Shush ! " my mother scolded out of the side of her mouth . <p> Then one of my teachings came back to me : " You 're garbage ! " Lillie shouted in my mother 's ear . I cringed as I waited for my mother to figure out where Lillie 'd gotten this . <p> But she just put Lillie down on the flagstones and clung to the binoculars with both hands . <p> " This is really something , " she said . Lillie was pounding on her thigh <p> It began to seem like we were standing there forever . My mother just could n't get over it . She fed quarter after quarter into the machine as Forrest stood at her side with his arms folded across his chest . When a busload of tourists flooded the viewing area , I found my attention drifting to them , to the fact that they were all wearing jackets but also shorts , as if willing it to be hotter and more vacation like than it was . <p> Lillie kept pounding my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she started crying my mother reluctantly pulled away from the machine and lifted Lillie up into her arms . Some big kid with glasses immediately took over the binoculars . <p> We made our way back through the building , heading through the cafeteria to return to the car and feed Lillie . But by then Lillie was wailing . She was so worked up she could n't form words , she just pointed at the food stand and mumbled gibberish like a baby . My mother patted her back and murmured , " It 's too expensive , baby . There 's food in the car . Just hold on a few more minutes . " <p> " Maybe if we eat here it will satisfy her , " Forrest said behind me . <p> " What ? " said my mother , turning to him . She put Lillie down with an umph . " We ca n't spend our money in these places . " <p> " I want to go to Deadwood , " I said , annoyed that Lillie was getting her way . We 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from TV . I thought we might be able to catch a gunfight . " You promised , " I reminded my mother . <p> " I 'll go get the food from the car , " Forrest said . <p> My mother looked at him . " No you won't- " she began . <p> " It 's okay , " he said . " I 'll be right back . " <p> I was being ignored , standing between them while they talked over my head . " Hey , " I said , poking at my mother . " What about Deadwood ? " <p> Suddenly Lillie let loose a blood-curdling scream and everybody at the tables turned around and looked at us . <p> " I 'll be right back , " Forrest said , and he was gone . <p> My mother gave a sigh but quickly turned to the sobbing Lillie . " Lillie-Belle , shhh , " she said , squatting down to rub her back . " We 're gon na eat in a minute , baby . " <p> " Mom ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hush , just hush ! " she commanded . <p> Lillie immediately started screaming at the lapse in attention . " You 're garbage ! You 're garbage ! " she shouted . <p> My mother recognized it this time and gave me a withering look . " I 'm gon na brain you , " she said . Then she grabbed Lillie by the shoulders and shook her . " You , too ! Now stop it this minute ! " <p> Lillie whimpered but quieted down , and my mother led us to an empty table . " You better not go back on your promise , " I muttered . <p> " Enough ! " my mother said . She started yanking napkins from the dispenser and slapping them down around the table like place mats . <p> When Forrest finally came back he seemed as mellow as ever . But in her anger , my mother 's suspicions flared up again . " Better ? " she said sarcastically . <p> Forrest was bustling around the table , giving us all sandwiches . He stopped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What about Deadwood ? " I asked , folding my arms and ignoring my sandwich . <p> " Sure , " Forrest said distractedly . " We 'll go there . " <p> " No , " my mother said . Lillie had folded her arms , too , and was refusing to touch her sandwich . My mother had to take it and place it in her hand . <p> " What ? " I said . " That 's not fair ! " <p> Forrest nodded carefully . " Yes , " he said . " we may never pass through here again . " <p> Lillie slapped her sandwich back down on the napkin . <p> My mother went stiff for an instant . " Do n't you start , " she said to the table in general . Then she picked Lillie 's sandwich back up . <p> " I 'm not starting , " Forrest said . " Hey , " he said , " when we get to Seattle , we 're going to be rich . " He laughed and waved an arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " <p> My mother pried open Lillie 's fingers and jammed the sandwich back into her hand . " Oh really ? " she said . " You gon na get a job , too ? " <p> Forrest 's eyes went wide and he blinked . " Sure , " he said . His smile was sad for a moment , then he seemed to snap back . " I 'll get a job building bridges . They must have bridges in Seattle . Only Indians are dumb enough to build bridges . " <p> My mother snorted . " You 're afraid of heights , " she said . <p> " What about Deadwood ? " I asked . <p> " I said no ! " my mother said . " We 've got to start making time ! I 've got a job to get to ! " , " Do n't worry , " Forrest said . " I 'll find something . " <p> " But Mom  --  " I started . <p> Lillie slapped her sandwich down again and there was an explosion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blew her hair from her face . " God help me , " she said . <p> " I 'll find something , " Forrest said again , staring vacantly at his sandwich . <p> " I do n't care anymore , " my mother said . She sank back into the passenger seat and waved a hand of dismissal in front of her face . Forrest took it as a sign that he should drive us farther up into the mountains to Deadwood . <p> But when we got there , there was n't much to see . The saloons looked fake and there were no cowboys or gunslingers , only a crowd of tourists . We walked along the sidewalks for a few minutes , my disappointment growing deeper and deeper that it did n't look like it did on TV . My mother stayed a few feet behind us , sunglasses hiding her eyes , arms folded tight . <p> We had come to a stop on the edge of town and were staring off at a small mound holding a desultory cemetery that was obscured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Visit the Final Resting Places of Famous Shoot-Out Victims , " when a man wearing shorts and knee-high black socks came up to Forrest . Forrest had been staring off with a hand shading his eyes from the sun , and he was confused when the man said , " Pardon me , do you work here ? " <p> Forrest thought about it for a minute and said , " Well , I work wherever I can . " <p> " Oh , for God 's sake , " my mother said , stepping up . Her big , black sunglasses flashed in the sun . " Of course he does n't work here . " <p> The man looked surprised , then annoyed . <p> " Just get away from us , " my mother said in disgust . She put one hand on my back and the other on Lillie 's and steered us directly back to the car . Forrest followed quietly . <p> After that , he began to drive relentlessly , spiraling down out of the mountains and hauling us out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a huge thunderstorm on the distant horizon . Nobody said a word as we watched the curtain of darkness , rent by sheets of lightning , moving toward us , and it looked fearful all the way . When it was upon us , Forrest had to slow the car down to a crawl . But it swept over us quickly , a swift pounding of the car , then moved off to the other horizon as we drove on , accelerating into the following night . <p> I was tired . I could actually feel it in my legs , a muscular tension and numbness from being cramped in the car , and a weariness , too , from all the walking around . The long day of tourism became a jumble of sensations , with each place becoming confused with another until they virtually blocked each other out . In the void , the excitement of the trip had worn off ; I could n't figure out why we were doing this anymore , and I gradually found myself thinking about home , actually remembering us there as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing ghosts of ourselves . " We should go back , " I wanted to say . <p> In the dark , we could n't find any national parks , and eventually we had to settle for a private campground somewhere in Wyoming , a small place with spotty grass and clumps of slender , wind-bent juniper saplings . It was crowded with trailers and RVs and station wagons , and the bathrooms had no showers and were a long way off . <p> We pitched the tent between two silvered trailers , working by the light cast through their small , awninged windows . When we were done my mother plopped down on the ground , exhausted . <p> Forrest gathered sticks for a fire . " If you want to go and wash up , I 'll watch the kids , " he said to the shadows where mother sat . <p> " Really ? " her voice said dryly . It was another moment where we all thought about what Forrest had hidden in the car trunk that one time . <p> He looked down into the pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly . <p> The pause that followed reminded me of when my mother used to smoke , and she would stave off anger by tossing down her cigarette and grinding it into the dirt for a long , slow moment . " We 're not going to Yellowstone tomorrow , " she said . " No more stops . " Then she got up and left . <p> Forrest stared after her , then shifted his gaze to the car . I felt compelled to speak . " Tell us a story , " I said . <p> He turned to me almost gratefully and folded himself down to sit cross-legged by the pile of twigs . <p> " What do you want to hear ? " he asked . Then he reached over and gathered up Lillie , who was sitting next to him , half-asleep . He cradled her gently in his arms . <p> I wanted him to just toss her in the tent . " Anything , " I said . " Crazy Horse ? " <p> " Hmmm , Tasunke Witco . . . " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you stories about Crazy Horse . " <p> " Well , what Indians are going to be next to him ? " I asked . I was thinking about the blown-up mountain , thinking it was going to be an Indian version of Mt . Rushmore . <p> Forrest knew what I meant . " Oh , just Crazy Horse . But you are right . There should be many Indians next to him . Red Cloud . Sitting Bull , for sure . " <p> " Are you related to him ? " I asked . " Chief Sitting Bull ? " <p> " No , " Forrest said . " I wish I was . But I know a good story about him . " Lillie murmured in her sleep . Forrest rocked her . The lights of the trailer next to us had gone out and Forrest seemed to have forgotten about starting a fire . It was just the two of us , sitting in the dark . <p> " He was n't really a chief , he was . . . wichasha wakon  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But his medicine was very powerful , and the whites were afraid of him . Even when he surrendered , they made him live apart from the other Indians , in a lit'le hut out by a river . He lived there with his wife , and some trick ponies Buffalo Bill had given him . They would dance when they heard a tom-tom . But the other Indians wanted to be with Sitting Bull , so they went out to the river , too . The whites decided they had to put Sitting Bull in jail , so they sent some soldiers out there to get him . The Indians di' n't understand , they gathered around Sitting Bull , and one of the soldiers got scared and he shot Sitting Bull . Bang ! Bang ! Tatanka Yotake fell down , dead , and then all his horses started dancing . The Indians and the soldiers got very scared . They thought Sitting Bull 's spirit was in the horses . " <p> " What happened then ? " I asked . <p> " Hell broke loose , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken treaties , much blood  --  " <p> My mother stepped out of the darkness and I nearly jumped out of my skin . <p> " Jesus Christ , Mom ! " I shouted . The words leapt out of me . <p> In one stride she stepped over to me and slapped me hard across the face . She 'd never hit me like that before . <p> " Do n't you ever talk like that to me ! " she said . <p> I could n't help it , I started to cry . <p> Forrest 's whole body flinched , as if he 'd been hit , and it woke up Lillie . She started to cry when she heard me , and her wailing seemed to fill the camp . <p> My mother spun around to face Forrest . " What are you doing to my children ? " she said . His mouth opened in surprise . " Telling them these horrible stories ! " she said . And then , to my utter surprise , she buried her face in her hands and started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job to get to , " she sobbed . <p> Forrest stood but was uncertain whether to move to my mother or not . <p> " I 'm sorry , Katrina , " he said , but my mother just stood there sobbing . <p> " I 'll take the kids to clean up , " he offered , and when my mother still did n't react , he stretched a hand out to me . " Come , " he said , and he led us away from my mother . <p> We made our way through the dark campground , the crickets throbbing the only sound . We spent a long time in the washroom . Forrest seemed to be lost in thought as he carefully washed Lillie 's face , tucking her hair back and cleaning behind her ears . She was sniffling , half-asleep and cranky in his hands , but eventually he managed to soothe her . When he was done he held her by the shoulders , propped on the edge of the sink , and smiled at her . " She 'll be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in Seattle . " I was n't sure if he meant Lillie or my mother , but I was relieved to hear that we were almost there . <p> We walked slowly back through the camp , but when we got within sight of our tent , Forrest stopped and said , " Wait . " My mother had started the fire and she was sitting there staring into it . " In here , " Forrest said , gently pulling Lillie and me into a nearby clutch of juniper saplings so my mother would n't see us . We stood there a long time , and I was n't sure what we were doing . I looked up at Forrest  --  framed in a headdress of dark , rustling leaves  --  trying to figure this out . His gaze was fixed on my mother . <p> She did n't move , she just stared into the fire , until Forrest put Lillie down and told us to go to her . <p> When Lillie and I walked up to the fire , hand in hand , my mother looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms in a sudden rush , like we 'd been away from her for a much longer time . She hugged us , then held us at arm 's length and looked at us , eyes brimming She held us for a long moment before she seemed to realize we 'd walked up alone . <p> She looked off the way we 'd come . The stand of thin trees was thick in the liquid darkness . <p> " Forrest ? " she said . " Forrest ? " <p> Forrest never came out of the trees . We waited , my mother standing and staring at the dark , until finally she gathered us up and we went into the tent to sleep . " He 's probably just taking one of his midnight walks , " she said nervously . <p> In the morning we could n't find him . My mother stopped me from asking anyone if they 'd seen him , but we walked around the campsite for a long time looking . At first , my mother , seemed dazed , but by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was angry and determined . She strode directly back to the tent , and we began to pack up . When she tossed Forrest 's rolled-up sleeping bag in the trunk , I saw her pause for a moment , and the angry look left her face . She stared at the spare-tire wheel well , and I wondered momentarily if there had ever been a bottle of whiskey there . But my mother 's still gaze seemed to be searching for more than that . Then the look switched off and she closed the trunk . She drove us the rest of the way , straight through to Seattle . <p> She remained that way for a long time , tight-lipped and determined , before she revived somewhat , coming around to something like her old self . Her new job helped , I think , as it was busy and filled with more responsibility than any job she 'd ever had before . I was in my new school , and Lillie was being watched during the days by an elderly neighbor . The trip , surprisingly , quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dulled recollection to something I rarely thought about in the hubbub of starting over . <p> We went on with our lives . We never talked about Forrest . In my own thoughts , I barely even tried to guess at why he 'd disappeared . There had been so much tension , and then we moved so quickly after he left us . It seemed to make a kind of sense , as if he 'd meant to offer relief somehow . After a while , it seemed like it had always been , before Forrest , and it was quite some time  --  months  --  before I would notice the sound of my mother crying at night . In the mornings , though , she would seem herself . Eventually , I stopped hearing her in the darkness , until one morning I came down to find her in her bathrobe , staring out the kitchen window . When she saw me , she smiled . " In my mind , I 've gone to California , Disney-man , " she said . <p> And over the years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could no longer precisely find his face in the ocean of my memory ; he became a jumble of images , like the trip itself . I was happy , years later , when my job with the government took me over some of those same highways , because I wanted to place the memories of that time in sequence . I thought that was the only way they would add up to something . I 'm not sure if I 've done that , though , or merely remembered things in an order that my grown-up knowledge of American geography tells me must be so . It could be that my memory is not true . <p> Still , I have tried to verify it as best I can , to get out of my memory what I can . In a motel room one night , I found the story of Sitting Bull 's murder in a book . The book was written by a white man , like myself , perhaps wishful , like myself . The book 's version was slightly different from Forrest 's , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , and which are the book 's . Sometimes , when think of that story , I find I have substituted Forrest 's face for Sitting Bull 's : it is Forrest 's horses who are dancing . <p> And on the endless hours of American highways , that is the way my mind works , remembering things as if they were interior movies , remembering the things , even , that I did n't participate in ; remembering things long past as if they were still going on . The people of my life play all the parts in flickering images , dreamlike images , as I stare off at the grass . Passing stands of trees , I imagine Forrest in there , like Red Cloud , staring out at me . Passing meadows , I see him  --  for moments oh so flecting  --  waving his blanket , signaling the ghosts . <p> I search for control , when the tingling comes up , but still , I stop at every historical marker . <p> <p> By Dennis Johnson <p>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
