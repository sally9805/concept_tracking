<p> KISSIMMEE , Fla. - It was Aug.29 , 1995 . The Astros ' playoffs hopes were fading under the weight of an 11-game losing streak . To make matters worse , the Astros were heading for Atlanta to play the National League 's best team . <p> Three starters - first baseman Jeff Bagwell , shortstop Orlando Miller and right fielder Derek Bell - were out of the lineup with injuries . Bell had a deep thigh bruise from being hit by a pitch a week earlier . He had missed two games in Florida because it was almost impossible for him to run . <p> But he made a decision to take the field and give it a shot because of the situation the team was in . <p> " " Terry Collins asked me if there was any way I could play because they really needed me , " Bell said . " " When my manager asks me something like that , I 'm going to do my best to go out there and give it everything I have . <p> " " Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward if I would just help them out that night . The Braves were starting a tough lefty in Kent Mercker , and Terry said my bat might make a difference and help end the losing streak . " <p> Collins was right . Bell was 4-for-5 with a home run and three RBIs while leading the Astros to a much-needed 11-9 victory at Fulton County Stadium . <p> But Bell 's heroics came with a high price tag . <p> Late in the game while sprinting for a line drive in the gap , Bell felt something pop in his left thigh . He limped off the field not knowing at the time that his season was over . <p> The injury was a tear of the rectus muscle in Bell 's thigh that had gone undetected in medical tests because it was covered up by the large hematoma . The tear was discovered during surgery to eliminate the hematoma . <p> " " None of us knew how serious Derek 's injury was , " Collins said . " " He had a bruise and it was hurting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this much : He went in there and helped end our losing streak . I do n't know if that would have happened without him . " <p> Some players might feel bitter about having a career-best season come to an end after being asked to play through an injury . <p> Bell said he would do the same thing again . <p> " " I look at it from the standpoint that I helped us turn things around , " Bell said . " " Maybe we would have fallen out of the playoff race completely if I had n't played and we had lost that game . As it turned out , I got hurt , but I did what my teammates and my manager needed me to do at the time . Playing that night meant something to my team . " <p> Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker believes that kind of commitment is something few people realize about Bell . <p> " " That 's the kind of attitude that helps win championships , " Hunsicker said . " " It shows why Derek is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division . " <p> It was hard for Bell to sit out the last month of the 1995 season and hope the team could reach the playoffs without him . <p> Losing him that night in Atlanta meant the Astros were without their top RBI man down the stretch . <p> Bell was well on his way to his first 100-RBI season . He had a .334 average , 86 RBIs and 27 steals when his season ended with 30 games to go . <p> " " There were so many games in September where I knew I could have made a difference , " Bell said . " " Even if it was just to pinch-hit or try to steal a base . Then I almost had a heart attack sitting at home watching them on the last day of the season . <p> " " After they came back and won ( at Chicago ) , I switched over to the Colorado game and prayed the Rockies would lose . I told myself that if we got in ( the playoffs ) , I was going to be out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That was a horrible feeling when Colorado won that game ( beating the Giants to clinch the wild-card berth ) . " <p> The victory by the Rockies allowed them to finish one game ahead of the Astros for the final playoff berth . It also meant Bell 's hopes of playing again in 1995 were over . <p> " " It was very disappointing to miss the last month , " Bell said . <p> " " But I guess things happen for a reason . I had a great year and I know I can do it again . My thigh is fine now . I want to show the fans I can be even better . " <p> Many Astros fans were not overjoyed with the 12-player trade in December 1994 that brought Bell to Houston from San Diego . <p> Nothing against Bell , but Ken Caminiti and Steve Finley were two of the team 's most popular players . <p> Bell was somewhat of an unknown quantity even though he had hit .311 the previous year with the Padres . <p> " " Derek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But he also <p> proved how much he cares with the way he approaches things . <p> " " I know it bothers him that he was n't out there at the end , but the truth is we would n't have had a chance at the end if it was n't for what he did at the beginning of the year . <p> Bagwell was struggling and Bell carried us by hitting .350 in the first two months . " Bell hit over .300 in all five months in which he played . The only thing he did n't do was hit for power . <p> He had eight homers when his season ended , and he might have become the first player in 10 years to drive in 100 runs without hitting at least 10 homers . Former St. Louis Cardinals infielder Tommy Herr had eight homers and 110 RBIs in 1985 . <p> " " For athletes that have the talent Derek has , the power will take care of itself , " Hunsicker said . " " It 's much more difficult to hit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 home runs , but it would be a big mistake to try to get him to focus on that . <p> " " A lot of hitters have been ruined by worrying about how many homers they could hit . " <p> The Astros will be content to have Bell continue to do what he has been doing as the team 's cleanup hitter . He recently avoided arbitration by agreeing to a one-year deal that will pay him at least $ 2.6 million this season , and possibly more than $ 3 million if he has a season similar to the one he had in ' 95 . <p> At 27 , Bell wo n't be eligible for free agency until 1999 , but he is n't looking to go to the highest bidder . After starting his career in Toronto and playing in San Diego , Bell wants to remain an Astro . <p> " " I hope I stay in Houston and never get traded again , " Bell said . " " I really love the city and I love playing on this team . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I feel comfortable here . I feel like this is where I 'm supposed to be . I hope the Astros and the fans feel the same way . " <p> A lot of young fans are going to feel good about Bell again this year since he has purchased 50 tickets for each home game that go to underprivileged children . <p> The kids sit in right field in a section known as " " Bell 's Posse " . Bell did the same thing last season . <p> He is always one of the players who can be seen signing autographs outside the Astrodome long after games end . <p> " " I like doing those kinds of things , " Bell said . " " If people appreciate what I do , then I want to try to do something for them . I always try to keep a positive perspective . " <p> That was n't easy to do in September sitting in his home in Tampa , but Bell has the type of happy-go-lucky personality that keeps him from getting down about a situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light-hearted . <p> Unpredictable is a good way to describe Bell 's actions at times . For example , in some games he wears his pants pulled down around his ankles , and some days he wears them just below his knees . Some games he wears a regulation cap , some he wears the cheap caps with the adjustable plastic notches in the back . <p> On a sweltering summer day last August in Miami , Bell was the only player who elected to wear a long-sleeve sweatshirt under his jersey , saying it would " " keep him cool once it got wet . " <p> Bell tries not to take things too seriously , but he is dead serious when he talks about what he thinks the Astros can do . <p> " " I do n't see how any team can find a way to stop us , " he said . <p> " " I just do n't see a weak area . Sean Berry will help us at third , and you know Doug Drabek and Greg Swindell are going to pitch better than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team will be better than last year , but he also thinks last year 's team would have been good enough to reach the playoffs if several key players had been healthier . <p> " " The only thing that stopped us last year was the injuries , " Bell said . " " I was out for a month , Bagwell and Miller were out for a month , and ( center fielder ) Brian Hunter also missed a lot of time . We ca n't be that unlucky again . <p> " " I guarantee you if me and Bagwell and ( Craig ) Biggio are in the lineup in September this year , we are going to get it done . "
