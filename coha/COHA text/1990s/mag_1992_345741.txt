For Bob Teeter , the 1992 campaign is shaping up like a recurring nightmare . It was 16 years ago that Teeter , serving as Gerald Ford 's campaign pollster , watched while the incumbent Republican President came under relentless attack from a more conservative Ronald Reagan . Although Ford eventually won the nomination , he was badly damaged by the intramural fight and went on to lose a close general election to Jimmy Carter . <P> Ford was later criticized for two miscalculations that may help explain why Bush has been madly maneuvering in recent weeks . First , critics said Ford was slow to take the Reagan challenge seriously , in part because the former actor did not win a primary until the North Carolina contest in late March 1976 . Apart from banning the word detente at the White House , Ford refused to pander to the party 's right wing . Instead he crisscrossed the country to meet Reagan head on , in a series of trips that made him look desperate and distinctly nonpresidential . <P> Bush , by contrast , is taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly to polish his conservative credentials by coming full circle on taxes and soliciting the resignation of National Endowment for the Arts Chairman John Frohnmayer after Buchanan demanded his head . Bush denied that a five-day swing through seven Southern states last week was beginning to make him appear panicked and frantic . " I 've thought about that , and I 've concluded it does n't . What I want to do is look like we 're not taking anything for granted . " But the same day , Bush suddenly cut short his travel plans and returned to Washington , where he will stay for the better part of a month . Bush will attack Congress for ignoring his " growth package " and hope regular attacks on Democrats will make him look presidential . " It 's the Jerry Ford factor , " explained a senior campaign adviser last week . " Teeter is spooked by his own past . " <P> The two races remain markedly dissimilar . Whereas Ford became President after Richard Nixon resigned , Bush was elected in his own right . Unlike Buchanan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice been elected Governor of one of the nation 's biggest states , and went on to win 10 primaries . Nonetheless , the spirit of 1976 may already be working for the Democrats . As a senior Bush campaign adviser said last week , " Everybody knows that the way to defeat an incumbent President is with a challenge from the ideological wing of the party . " <P> Buchanan knows that while Reagan lost the ' 76 nomination , his gutsy challenge to Ford strengthened his position in the crowded 1980 Republican primary race . Buchanan has already gained a spot near Dan Quayle in the 1996 starting gate . " Reagan dusted Ford up , but it did n't prevent him from winning it the next time , " an Administration official says . " Pat is rolling the dice and figures he could become the heir apparent to the conservative wing . " <P> Teeter may not be the only Bush operative having flashbacks to 1976 . Secretary of State James Baker was Ford 's campaign manager ; Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney was Ford 's chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1996 as well . ( Bush , whom Ford considered briefly as a possible Vice President in 1974 , largely sat out the ' 76 race as CIA director. )
