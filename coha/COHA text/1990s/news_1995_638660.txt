<p> Here 's a sure way to salvage your season : Throw up your hands , start peddling all your veteran players and give everyone the impression you 're ready to quit . <p> When the Philadelphia Phillies traded veterans Dave Gallagher and Mariano Duncan two weeks ago , most observers figured they were lining up in punt formation . Team president Bill Giles addressed his players in a meeting and told them the organization was still serious about winning the World Series in 1995 . But Giles ' pep talk sounded remarkably like lip service . <p> Catcher Darren Daulton even ripped Phillies management for failing to make the necessary moves to keep the team in the race . He was n't above critiquing his own performance . " I 've been horrible the whole way through , " Daulton said . " I deserve as much blame as anybody . " <p> When the self-flagellation stopped , a funny thing happened : The Phillies climbed back into the race . <p> After losing 34 of 46 games to fall 15 1/2 behind Atlanta in the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They won eight of 10 entering the weekend to move into contention for a wild-card spot . <p> With Lenny Dykstra done for the season after knee surgery , manager Jim Fregosi has used Mickey Morandini and Kevin Flora , a second baseman acquired from California in the Gallagher trade who has been converted to the outfield , in the leadoff spot . The Phillies averaged 6.5 runs per game and batted .313 as a team while winning eight of 10 . <p> More important , they 're starting to catch some breaks . In a 7-6 victory over the Dodgers Thursday , the Phillies drove Pedro Astacio from the game with a come-backer off the leg in the 11th inning . Rudy Seanez , Astacio 's replacement , served up a home run to Charlie Hayes with his first pitch . <p> If the Phillies have a concern , it 's starting pitching . Curt Schilling underwent arthroscopic surgery on his shoulder Wednesday , and Tyler Green has been dreadful since the All-Star Game . How seriously can you take a team with Sid Fernandez as the resident staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot . " It 's getting exciting around here again , " first baseman Gregg Jefferies said . <p> This time , for all the right reasons . <p> AROUND THE BASES <p> Walt Weiss dresses in the young turks section of the Colorado Rockies clubhouse , where they keep the " Toad The Wet Sprocket " compact discs . His locker mates are Jason Bates and Curtis Leskanic , two guys who can make a 31-year-old feel like a relic . " Walt is here to give us guidance , " Bates said . " You know that show , ' My Three Sons ' ? With us , it 's ' My Two Sons . ' Walt is Fred MacMurray . " ... The Cincinnati Reds have n't had a bona fide leadoff man since Bip Roberts left for San Diego . Manager Davey Johnson used seven leadoff hitters in 114 games last season , and he 's used seven again this year . The breakdown by appearances : Jerome Walton ( 26 ) , Deion Sanders ( 25 ) , Thomas Howard ( 15 ) , Barry Larkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lenny Harris ( 10 ) and Eric Anthony ( six ) David Wells , a career American Leaguer , hit safely twice in his first four starts after being traded from Detroit to Cincinnati . " I used him wrong , " Tigers manager Sparky Anderson said . " I should have had him pinch hitting . " ... How nice a guy is Tony Gwynn ? After he hit his first career grand slam at Veterans Stadium , San Diego 's equipment manager obtained the historic baseball from a young fan in exchange for a brand-new ball . After learning of the transaction , Gwynn signed one of his bats and hand-delivered it to the fan . " As you run up and see the smile on his face , I think he thought it was a fair trade , " Gwynn said According to David Vincent of the Society for American Baseball Research , Kevin Stocker , Kevin Flora and Kevin Jordan of Philadelphia made history when they became the first three teammates named Kevin to homer in the same game . They each went deep in a 16-8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin Mitchell and Kevin Bass of the Giants , and Kevin McReynolds and Kevin Elster of the Mets And you thought baseball research-types just kept track of minutiae The New York Mets moved Jeff Kent to the cleanup spot after they traded Bobby Bonilla , and Kent 's average dropped from .286 to .262 in less than a month . Kent might benefit from a change of scenery ; his fellow Mets are n't especially fond of him , and he recently lashed out at the fans in New York for booing him By dumping Brett Butler , the Mets reduced their payroll to $ 12.7 million - second-lowest in the National League behind Montreal . If general manager Joe McIlvaine wants to pursue a cornerman with pop , he should have some cash at his disposal Padres pitcher Joey Hamilton , who set a major-league record by going hitless in his first 57 at-bats , thinks he has a soulmate in Colorado 's Bryan Rekar . In his first 16 at-bats , Rekar went hitless with 13 strikeouts . " I 'm going to keep an eye on him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him some pointers if he asks me nicely . " ... Delino DeShields , a major bust since coming to Los Angeles from Montreal , has regained the starting second base job from rookie Chad Fonville . After contributing two hits in a 7-2 victory over Montreal , DeShields placed a phone call to his mother . " It got so bad she was n't even reading the box scores anymore , " DeShields said . " I told her what happened and she said , ' You played ? " ' <p> NAMES IN THE GAME <p> Two National League pitchers have come busting out of the bullpen to give their teams a late-season lift . <p> Dave Burba , acquired by Cincinnati from San Francisco in the Deion Sanders trade , went 3-0 with a 1.04 ERA before a bad outing Thursday in St. Louis . Scouts say Burba has thrived because he has rediscovered his off-speed stuff . As a reliever , he relied strictly on his fastball and slider . <p> The other August sensation is Willie Blair , who stepped into the San Diego rotation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went 3-1 , 1.00 in his first four starts . <p> " As a starter , I feel like I can use all four of my pitches , " Blair said . " I 'm changing speeds more . I tried that as a reliever . But sometimes you do n't have enough time in the bullpen to get comfortable with all your pitches before you go in a game . " <p> Blair turned in some impressive starts with Colorado in 1993 . But he developed a tender elbow in September , and the Rockies used him exclusively as a reliever last season . <p> " I never got an explanation for that , " Blair said . " Maybe they thought I could n't pitch more than a couple of innings at a time . I thought I deserved a shot . It was n't as if they went out and got three David Cones . " <p> Montreal general manager Kevin Malone came to the defense of San Diego counterpart Randy Smith last Sunday . Smith is on a one-year deal , and Padres CEO Larry Lucchino does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the off-season . <p> " Everybody talks about the Jimmy Bowdens and Dan Duquettes and all those guys , " Malone said . " This guy ( Smith ) deserves some accolades and some praise . To consider not rehiring him would be a mistake for the San Diego Padres . " <p> Pittsburgh catcher Mark Parent has a reputation as a " 5 o'clock hitter " - a player who pounds the ball in batting practice only to go silent in games . <p> Parent is barely hitting .230 this year , but his 15 homers are two short of the club record for a catcher set by Jim Pagliaroni in 1965 . <p> Parent is an unlikely candidate to enter anybody 's record book . He began his pro career in Walla Walla , Wash. , in 1979 , and he has 330 games on his major-league resume . <p> But he 's the nicest , most unassuming guy you 'll find . Parent is a 34-year-old journeyman , and he knows it . <p> " I 'm 6-5 , 240 pounds , " Parent said . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere . The disappointing part is when you 're 6-5 , 240 , and you hit the ball and it does n't go anywhere . "
