<p> IT took about two minutes to figure this was not the typical , 1993-model fishing trip . <p> Epiphany struck when the lower unit of the little outboard thunked into a rock hidden under the Colorado River 's gray-green surface . <p> We were negotiating a shallow riffle about 100 yards downstream from the boat ramp below the Loop 230 bridge in Smithville , and 38 miles from our eventual destination , the ramp under Business 71 in La Grange . <p> Nope , you do n't have flowing water , shallow gravel bars , narrow , braided channels and tricky little rock-knobbed riffles with which to contend when you 're on the giant , stagnant reservoirs that define modern freshwater fishing in Texas . <p> But here on the almost ignored Colorado , neither do you have to contend with crowds , skiers , potlickers of every stripe , noise or just about anything else connected with the modern fishing experience . <p> This little expedition , an overnight float/fishing trip on a living , breathing , changeable river , certainly was something different . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time . And the heck of it is that it 's so close and so easily accessible , so intriguing and wild , and still few people pay it any mind . <p> My motor came through the rock encounter with no damage . But the collision was a wake-up call . This was as much a way to relive the past as enjoy the present  --  and catch a few fish in the bargain . <p> Of the four of us on the trip , I was the only one without a lot of time on the modern Colorado . <p> The three other guys  --  Jim Cox , senior editor of Texas Parks and Wildlife Magazine , Roy Frye of TPWD 's resource protection division and Bob Parvin , a free-lance writer/photographer  --  live in Austin , and have discovered what a lot of people seem to have missed . <p> The Colorado River south of the capital can be a great place to enjoy a completely different kind of freshwater fishing : the float trip . It 's a style of fishing that seems to have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail fins disappeared from cars . <p> Back before the Corp of Engineers and the several river authorities began jamming big concrete plugs in every Texas river , a float trip was " " de rigueur " for bass fishers . <p> After all , bass are natives of living streams . When big reservoirs were rare , most bass chasers did their fishing from a flat-bottomed johnboat pushed down a river by oars or a small outboard . <p> That 's exactly what we used  --  three flatbottoms . And Frye had the perfect symbol for the trip attached to the stern of his boat : a 1957-model , 10-horse Johnson in mint condition , including original maroon and white paint . <p> It 's a cinch bet that brothers and sisters of that 36-year-old outboard churned the Colorado when they were new . <p> When we floated under the new Highway 71 bridge outside Smithville , we left the modern world in our wake . No bridge crosses the river for almost 35 miles . Neither is there any public access until you reach the take-out in La Grange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch of river filled with incredibly fishy water , mined with little riffles , shallows and gravel bars , dotted with islands , lined with corridors of trees and sprinkled with wildlife . <p> Other people ? We did n't see a soul  --  a few boats tied up at little camps along the river edge , but I did n't see another human until we reached the take-out . <p> This was a fishing trip , so we fished . Hard . <p> The Colorado downstream from Austin could surprise anglers with its piscatorial potential . The river supports a healthy fish population , including more than 50 species . <p> Most of the local fishing pressure is aimed at the river 's abundant catfish  --  channel and flatheads  --  says Doyle Mosier , an ichthyologist/water quality specialist with the Lower Colorado River Authority . But bass are the big attraction for float-fishers . <p> " " There 's a good , under-utilized population of bass  - -  Guadalupe and largemouth  --  in the river , " says Mosier . " " The highest populations are probably on the upper end ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've seen Guadalupes as far down the river as Wharton . " <p> While both Guadalupes and largemouths live in the river , it 's the " " spotties " that dominate the Colorado . Largemouths , including some fish weighing as much as 6 or 7 pounds , can be found in the brushy backwaters . But the smaller Guadalupes are the fish to look for . <p> " " Guadalupes probably are the most common bass in the river . <p> They 're typical river fish , " Mosier says of Texas ' state fish and its only endemic bass . <p> The strikingly marked Guadalupes , natives of the rocky , moving water of central Texas rivers , act much like cold-water trout , Mosier says . <p> " " Adult fish tend to hang around the juncture of fast-moving water and slow-moving water , places like the edges of riffles , " he said . <p> That 's exactly where we found the Guadalupes . We did n't find many , though . Every Guadalupe caught came from swift-running areas , particularly from the eddy lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Cox landed the best Guadalupe of the trip , a brilliantly-marked 15-incher . <p> The best lures for the Guadalupes proved to be spinnerbaits and small crankbaits . Plastic worms are the choice for plumbing the slack-water brush piles where largemouths lurk . <p> Our fishing success was , to be charitable , only fair . But we were n't exactly fishing under the best of conditions . Daytime temperatures hit three digits , a bright moon at night , and the river was a bit high and murky . <p> The LCRA , which controls the final 500 miles of the Colorado , maintains a fairly high water flow in the lower section of the river from May to October . <p> The steady volume , about 2,000 cubic feet of water per second in the Smithville/La Grange stretch , is designed to provide irrigation water for farmers downstream . <p> The river authority has to release enough freshwater to prevent saltwater from sneaking up the river and contaminating irrigation water . <p> The best time to float-fish the Colorado is during autumn , after the LCRA reduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 300-500 cfs , and the river clears , turning a brilliant , clean green . <p> Sight-feeding fish such as bass become much more prone to strike in the clearer water , and the cooler autumn temperatures increases their activity . <p> Even with the marginal fishing , our recent trip was a joy . <p> There were so many great fishing spots , it was fun just anticipating casting to the next one . It was quiet , green and relaxing . And the river provided a constant stream of wonderful sights and sounds to enjoy . <p> Bird life is thick along the water  --  wood ducks , warblers , Coopers and red-tailed hawks , cardinals and more yellow-billed cuckoos ( " " rain crows " to us native east Texans ) than I 've ever seen . <p> But the avian high-point of the trip came when Cox and I rounded a bend in the river and a huge , white-headed , white-tailed bird took wing from a perch on a snag overlooking the river . <p> It was a mature bald eagle , a common sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very rare in late summer . <p> It 's impossible to lose yourself in time on a reservoir  - -  the artificialness of the man-made lake is all too apparent . But it was easy to imagine myself in another age on some sections of the lower Colorado . <p> Round a bend , and see a spring flowing out of the side of a bluff , a luxuriant mat of ferns marking the spot where the cool , clear water cascades down the incline and into the river . <p> See an eagle . Camp overnight on an island and trade hoots with a chorus of barred owls under a moon so bright you do n't need a lantern . Feel live , flowing water grab at your little boat . <p> Relearn how to read and run a river . Cast a lure to a seam on the up-current side of a riffle and feel the electric pulse of a truly wild bass smashing the offering . <p> No , a float-fishing trip on the Colorado is not your typical 1993 kind of fishing experience . It 's something out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motor .
