Burnt flesh newly whole , pink skin puckered on the back of the hand , a moonscape of scar tissue extending from the sleeve of a gray sport coat . In the correctness of dress , only the scars were out of place . As he reached out to shake the hand , Kevin Krueger tried not to hesitate . This was his friend , Jim Hawthorne , his former teacher , a man he loved , a man to whom he owed his career . " Been a long time , " said Krueger , squeezing the hand . " It 's great to see you . " Bright morning light cut a yellow wedge across the office floor , the northern light of a fall day under a blue New Hampshire sky . The gold dome of the state capitol seemed to blaze under its regard . His visitor noticed Krueger glancing at the scars . He gripped Krueger 's hand firmly , as if to show he had entirely healed . " We talked on the phone . " " But I have n't seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire . " Hawthorne let go of Krueger 's hand and stepped back . He was tanned and muscular , as if he spent part of every day at the health club , which was probably true . After all , he had been recuperating . Or perhaps it was that California glow . His hair was lighter than Krueger remembered , nearly blond and finely textured . Then , with shock , Krueger realized that Hawthorne 's hair must have been burned off . " You look well , " said Krueger , hesitating whether to remain standing or sit down . Hawthorne considered this estimate with amusement . " My doctor says I 've been putting myself back together , but it feels likeloafing . Now I want to return to work . " Renovation was going on in one of the state offices down the hall and the sound of an electric saw shrilled through the air . The work had begun on September 2 and after nearly three weeks Krueger still had n't gotten used to the noise . He noticed Hawthorne 's jaw tense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Krueger , turning to shut the window behind him . " It 's still school administration . " " Another sort of school ... " Krueger let the remark hang . He did n't wish to bring up the fire , but that meant their talk stayed on a level of superficiality that he had never experienced with his friend . Was he afraid Hawthorne might cry ? Or he himself would ? After all , he had baby-sat for Lily at least half a dozen times in Boston . In his mind 's eye , he could see her sparkling blond curls . Krueger had met Hawthorne seven years earlier at Boston University , when he had begun graduate study in clinical psychology . Jim Hawthorne had been his adviser as well as teacher . Hawthorne was now thirty-seven . His birthday was in February , the same month as the fire . Only six years separated them and the two men had made many trips to various agencies and residential treatment programs throughout the state , especially to Ingram House in the Berkshires , where Krueger had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Krueger had said he was interested in a job with the New Hampshire Department of Education , Hawthorne had n't protested but had made the necessary calls from San Diego , even though he would rather have seen Krueger working in mental health . Yet if Krueger had taken a position someplace else , Hawthorne would n't have been here this morning and Krueger would n't have had the opportunity now to assist him . " I 've been on the phone with members of the board , " said Hawthorne , " and they 've sent me cartons of papers . Without actually visiting the place I do n't see how I could be any more prepared . " " All this in six weeks ? " " They want someone in residence before the semester is much advanced . Classes began two weeks ago . And I was ready to make the change . " He looked uncertain for a moment . " You know , it 's time to make a fresh beginning . " Krueger wondered what Hawthorne meant by being " ready . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even his tie looked new . But of course his other clothes had been destroyed . In fact , in terms of property , he 'd probably lost everything . But what had he lost of the restof his essential self , what people outside their profession might call the soul ? " There 's no real town nearby , at least for twenty miles , " said Krueger . " I like the country . Perhaps I 'll learn to ski . " " You could get stuck after the snow begins . The roads can completely shut down . " " You 're not very optimistic . " " These places , they develop their own ways of doing things . They get terribly ingrown : cousins and high school chums working together for years ... " " That 's probably why the board insisted on an outside hiring . " " Of course , of course . " Glancing at Hawthorne 's hand , Krueger saw how the scar tissue extended up the backs of his fingers , how the little finger had no nail but ended in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome and somewhat gaunt , with dark indentations beneath his cheekbones . He wore glasses with pewter frames that kept sliding down his nose which he pushed back up with his thumb . Krueger was a few inches shorter and stocky , with a receding hairline , bushy eyebrows and a thick mustache , as if these bristling growths were soft bumpers between him and the world . These were men of similar backgrounds who had gone to similar New England schools and universities . They read the same magazines and newspapers , the same books . They felt at home in the same fashionable sections of Boston or San Diego , New York or San Francisco . But one had suffered great tragedy and the other kept trying to imagine it . Krueger had felt inadequate to the task of helping his friend . He had written . They talked on the phone . Hawthorne 's life had taken a turn impossible to anticipate and Krueger had been struck with wonder and compassion . " It 's hardly your sort of school , " he said . Hawthorne suddenly grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like myself . " " You 're a clinical psychologist with a tremendous reputation . " " The school claims to specialize in youngsters with special needs . " " You know what that means . Highly structured environment , empathy development , special needsit 's code . The school 's just a dumping ground . " " It 's been around a long time . " " In name only . Even ten years ago it was different . They started that business about special needs when enrollment began to fall . Their accreditation hangs by a thread . " " You think I ca n't save it ? " There was a hint of something in Hawthorne 's voice . Not anger or bravado . Perhaps it was no more than a touch of metal . " I think it 's an impossible task . Bishop 's Hill needs an endowment , a new student body , a new faculty , and a new physical plant . They 'd do better to tear the place down and start over . " " The board 's given me complete control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they know you 're coming ? " " They were notified on Thursday . " Krueger almost smiled . " They must be jumping . And why did you decide against a residential treatment center ? " " Maybe I need a break . " Hawthorne sat down at last , perching on the edge of the chair . Glancing around the office , his eyes settled on the photograph of Krueger 's wife , Deborah , and their son and daughter . He looked away . " Maybe I just do n't want that work anymore . " Krueger began to speak quickly . " I 've been hearing about Bishop 's Hill ever since I came here . The faculty keeps leaving , many are barely qualified . Parents complain . The health department came within an inch of closing down their kitchen . And there were other stories , allegations even . " " That 's why they were eager to have me . " " What happened to the previous headmaster ? " " He 's been gone several years . They had a sort of halfhearted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a new commitment . " " It was either that or sell out to the Seventh-Day Adventists . " Krueger rubbed the back of his neck . He hoped he was n't getting another of his headaches . Hawthorne had been one of the preeminent administrators at one of the preeminent treatment centers in the country . He could probably go anywhere . Instead , he was choosing a fifth-rate institution on the verge of closing . " You 'll be buried there , " added Krueger . Hawthorne seemed not to have heard . " What sort of person is the acting head ? " " Fritz Skander ? He 's the bursar . I 've talked to him on the phone . Well-spoken , kind of upbeat and ironic at the same time . He was hired to teach math , then worked his way into the management end of things . He 's been acting head for two or three years . Personally , I thought he 'd be the one to get the job . " " He has no background in psychology or administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rsum . " " You have tremendous ability . What about your research , your writing ? " Hawthorne began to speak , then turned away . A bony , angular face with a jutting chinthe morning light emphasized every wrinkle that had appeared since Krueger had seen him last , and again he recalled Lily 's glorious curls . The mother , too , had been blond . " Skander will be associate headmaster and continue as bursar , as well as teaching a section of geometry . The board chairman kept saying how everyone would have to bite the bullet . Otherwise , there 's a psychologist at the school , a couple of mental health counselors . I 've looked over the records of about half the students . I 'd like to hire another psychologist as soon as possible . " " And the physical plant ? " " Serviceable but failing . There 's a fund drive to replace the roof of the main building , Emerson Hall . Several of the dormitory cottages need substantial work . " Hawthorne ticked off various problems on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replace a stove in the kitchen , faulty wiring in one of the dorms , cracking plaster . Krueger asked questions and his friend responded . Despite the difficulties , Hawthorne was eager to face the challenge . It was a new undertaking to fill his mind . As he said , a new beginning . Krueger had heard from Hawthorne two days earlier after a silence of six weeks . He was leaving San Diego and would fly into Logan Sunday evening , then stay at a hotel and drive up to Concord on Monday . In his initial surprise , the only detail Krueger found odd was that Hawthorne would stay in a hotel . He probably had dozens of friends in the Boston area . It was only after Krueger hung up that he began to wonder about Hawthorne 's whole enterprise . " Why 's Jim coming to New Hampshire ? " Deborah had asked . " He 's taking a job at Bishop 's Hill . Headmaster . " Saying those words , Krueger had thought they sounded crazy , as if his friend had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weekend , Krueger made some calls . Maybe something had changed at Bishop 's Hill in the past few months . But nothing Krueger heard had encouraged him and what had started out sounding insane only appeared more so . Perhaps , he thought , Hawthorne was planning a book and the school was connected with some new area of research . Now , talking to Hawthorne , Krueger felt in no way persuaded , especially since the research and writing appeared to be a dead issue . But even if Hawthorne 's only intention was to keep the school afloat and even if the board had committed itself to a new financial effort , it seemed too little too late . Krueger rubbed the back of his neck and wondered where he had put his aspirin . " Maybe you can do it , " said Krueger , trying to be optimistic . " It 's astonishing that the place is still open . And of course it 's expensive . Dumping grounds usually are . " Hawthorne rose from his chair and walked to the window . Sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the parking lot . Hawthorne looked both ready and stoical , like a man about to lift something heavy . But mixed with his stoicism was sorrow . Not that his brow was creased or his shoulders were bent ; he seemed perfectly calm . Indeed , in the strong chin , Krueger believed that others would see determination . But Krueger could n't help but imagine the awfulness of Hawthorne 's memories . If it had been his own wife and child , he did n't see how he could live . Hawthorne walked over and squeezed Krueger 's shoulder . " Jesus , it 's great to see you . You remember those basketball games we used to have ? Maybe we can do that again . " The warmth of his smile was a great reassurance . Krueger tried to speak but could only nod a little foolishly . " I wanted to come out to California in February . " " I could n't have seen anyone . I was dead . Dead inside at least . " " Even so ... " Krueger tugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What other problems do you think I 'll have at Bishop 's Hill ? " With relief Krueger returned to the subject that , though bleak , was at least precise . " Your presence should do wonders for morale . I 'll bet even the non-psychology types have been reading your articles . You 'll have to be firm , of course . I 'm sure they 've been worried by how things have drifted along . The main thing is the childrenteenagers really . They 're the ones who 've suffered . " " Anything more than educational neglect ? " " A tenth grader was arrested for shoplifting in Plymouth in May . Some drunk driving . Marijuana . The school uses a totally antiquated merit system with so many checks resulting in punishment . On the other hand , a new teacher joined the staff in January . I do n't think it 's an us-against-them scenario . There 's even a new cook . " " Then what 's the problem ? " " I 'd like you closer to Concord , where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it sounded false to his ears . " And it 's not your area of expertise . " " You think I wo n't be able to do it ? " " You 're a tremendous administrator . " " That was before . " Krueger turned in his chair . " I 'll be frank with you . I do n't understand why you want Bishop 's Hill . It 's a pseudo-prep school for kids who have managed to stay out of agencies or institutions only because their parents have money . It 's a sinking ship . I do n't know if anybody could fix it and I do n't know why you want to . " " I told you , I want to do something different . " " And that 's sufficient reason to go to Bishop 's Hill ? You could go to one of the best places in the country and you 're choosing one of the worst . The money must be terrible . " Krueger tried to make it a joke , but it did n't sound like a joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " So what are you doing it for ? " " Simple professionalism . " " It 'll be like trying to empty Lake Winnipesaukee with a pail . " " Maybe that 's what I 'm good for right now . Listen , I have to start completely over . Ca n't you see that the fire was my fault ? When this position opened up at Bishop 's Hill , I jumped at it . " " You know as well as I do who caused the fire . " Hawthorne ignored him . " If Bishop 's Hill does n't work out , then I 'm finished . I do n't mean I could n't get other jobs . lust that this is the last chance I 'm giving myself . " The silence that followed was filled with the whine of the saw . Krueger heard his secretary laugh and a door slam . He thought of how far Hawthorne had traveled from Krueger 's own life . " You 'll spend the night ? Deborah 'd love to see you . And your namesake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to get up there as soon as possible . About how far is it ? " " Two and a half hours door-to-door . The color should be just getting started . " " I had some stuff shipped from San Diego . It 'll arrive next week . " " But you 'll stay for dinner ? " " Thanks , but I still get tired pretty easily . " Krueger stood up . His chair spun back and hit the wail with a thud . " We need to talk more . Stay for lunch . If I were the one going up there , I think I 'd move into it gently . " " You think I 'll fuck up , do n't you ? " " Of course not , but they 've had lots of time to get fixed in their ways . " Krueger was aware of not answering the question . What did he know of his friend 's mental state ? Only that Hawthorne had chosen to bury himself in a backwater , which was itself evidence of eccentricity . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " As you say , the children come first . " It seemed only politeness that was holding him back . Krueger gave up . The conversation had exhausted him . " Give me a call once you get there . Or I 'll call you . You know that my office is at your disposal . " Hawthorne grinned . " It 's been a while since I 've gone to school . " They shook hands again . This time Krueger kept his eyes away from the scars . He wondered how much was hidden by Hawthorne 's clothes , whether his entire body had the shiny delicacy of the wrist . Although Krueger felt guilty , he was comforted by Hawthorne 's grip . It seemed evidence of something positive . I 'm grasping at straws , he thought . After he had shut the door , Krueger was struck by something Hawthorne had said . What had he meant by saying the fire was his fault ? That kid Carpasso had set the fire . Everyone knew that . The girl sat on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stared at her toes in their small , golden thongs . The toenails had just been painted a shade of red called " Passion Juice " and were not entirely dry . They sparkled in the intensity of the spotlights . The girl 's back was bent and a strand of peroxided hair fell forward , concealing one side of her face . She picked at a dab of red on her toe and blew smoke from the corner of her mouth . Around her left ankle was a gold chain with a heart , a gift from her father six years earlier . She seemed alone in the room despite the two dozen men and the waitresses in their skimpy dresses weaving between the tables . A few men clapped as Gypsy , naked and businesslike , walked briskly from the stage to the dressing room , carrying a little blue dress in one hand and a pair of black high heels in the other . She had just finished her number , and briefly there was a kind of silence . Someone whistled shrilly ; a chair scraped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rim of a glass . The music began again . The girl dropped her cigarette and ground it into the tile . By the time she was on her feet she was already into her dance , sashaying up the remaining two steps and across the stage , her eyes focused on the spotlights so everything would be a blur when she looked away . The music was the long disco version of the Stones ' " Miss You , " and she matched her steps to the staccato precision of the drums and bass , snapping her fingers and lifting her knees so they flashed in the lights . She thought of the music as antiquethe song was twenty years oldand she imagined that her parents had once danced to it , her father taking Dolly 's hand , then spinning her away . The girl kept her head raised as she moved to the chrome pole in the middle of the stage . She was the cool one who never let her eyes drift below an imaginary line , as if beneath that line were only fog , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men would often say , " Why do n't you look at me ? " And sometimes they whined and sometimes they called her " Bitch . " She wanted to say , " Fuck you , " but she 'd just smile as if her thoughts were in exotic places , Zanzibar or Rio de Janeiro . And when the men tucked ten- or twenty-dollar bills under the thin gold chain around her waist , she would stroke their cheeks just once and draw her nails lightly down the stubble on their faces , but she still would n't look at them . Gripping the pole with her right hand , the girl swirled around it with her head back and her nearly white hair streaming behind her . She had pinned it up but , as she spun , her hair came free and she could feel how the men grew attentive , as if her hair 's very loosening were a sign of her wildness . The girl focused on the mirrors on the ceiling above the stage , watching the pretty , heavily made-up face of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was amazed by her beauty and at the next by what she saw as her ugliness : her lips not enough of this , her nose not enough of that , and the blue of her eyes insufficiently dazzling . She wore a mixture of pastel-colored veils that fluttered in the breeze from a fan at the edge of the stage : a two-piece costume made by an ex-dancer who had gotten fat and now designed costumes for other girls , polyester delicacies whose only function was to be ripped away in a fantasy of sexual abandon . The veils whirled and eddied around her in varying shades of blue , green , and redpulsings that let the girl imagine herself a multicolored bird of Eastern mythology , beautiful but deadly . The stage was eight feet wide and formed a runway between the tables where the men sat . The dancers called it the meat rack . As the girl spun round the pole , the veils separated and came together , giving glimpses of her tanned body and revealing her small breaststoo small to the girl 's mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but after all , she was only fifteen .
