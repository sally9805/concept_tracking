Leslie What made her first appearance in F &SF; last month with her short story . " Clinging to a Thread . " Her second story is quite different . <p> Leslie wrote " Designated Hater " after a man driving a pickup followed her home one night . " I did n't want him to know where I lived , " she writes , " so I pulled into a stranger 's driveway and told my kids to crouch down and hide , hoping he 'd pass without seeing us . At the time , I wished these was something I could do to him . Maybe that 's the beauty of fiction . " <p> GO AHEAD , ADMIT IT . NOW and then you think about getting even . Like a month ago , walking back to work after a picnic in the park , your shoes shined , your fingertips smelling of sliced oranges . You planned to ask the new production manager to dinner . Only one block to go when you stepped in warm dog droppings . You spent the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid an odor so rank it made you want to puke , unable to stop tracking the scent . <p> Stupid dog owners , who let their dogs shit on the sidewalk  --  where it melts under the sun like bubble gum  --  instead of on their own constipated lawns . There it could have sat like wet toadstools for them to step on , making it their problem instead of yours . You do n't have a dog , and it pisses you off that dog owners never seem to step in crap . <p> Remember : <p> The weekend when you were late to pick up the kids from your ex 's . You stopped at the grocery for a carton of milk , a loaf of bread , and a couple of cans of tuna . The express lane was closed , so you waited , telling yourself it only felt like the line was moving slower than committing suicide by slit wrists . Then a checker tapped you on the shoulder and said , " I 'm open over here . " You left your place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checker could n't figure out how to open his machine ; when he did , someone sidled up to the other end of the counter , the freedom side , demanding that he count their bottles before they did their shopping . The checker pegged you as reasonable and said , " This will just take a second . " <p> It took five minutes because of a slight discrepancy in the bottle count . Meanwhile the checkers ballpoint pen stopped working ; he asked to borrow yours to scribble some numbers on his pad . An agreement was finally reached and the checker opened his register . He took his sweet time rooting around the drawer for change . Another checker leaned over to ask for a price check on baby lima beans . By the time your checker got back to you , you were steamed . Your ex was going to give you grief for being late again and you said , " I do n't need this shit ! " You tipped over the milk carton , grabbed the ballpoint you knew was n't yours , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there again . You were pissed and getting more pissed by the minute because you were hopelessly late , but still out of milk , bread , and tuna . <p> Remember : The night that guy in the olive-colored pickup pulled behind you and blasted his horn . To teach him a lesson , you lifted your foot from the accelerator , slowed the car , just a little , but enough to make him mad . Your cheeks blushed warm and you felt a little ache that you at first assumed was only your gut acting up ; before long you started worrying that the pain came from your heart . <p> The pickup 's brights were halogen enhanced . You switched your rearview mirror to its night setting , avoiding blindness , and gave him the bird when he roared past . He cut in front of you , as if mooning you with his truck . You leaned on your horn and switched on your brights , a little shaky but feeling brave for having fought back . Then you saw the empty gun rack through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And take a deep breath , then let it leak out with a growl that leaves your voice scratched like the finish on your first new car an hour after you drove it off the lot . <p> You 're sitting down for breakfast at your formica-top table . You chew on a mangle of dry toast , irritated beyond belief that you 're out of jam and coffee , and the only store within twenty miles is the one where you vowed you 'd never shop . You 're with a guy  --  not just any guy , but someone you 've heard of , maybe even respect , or at least fear  --  who has come to offer you the opportunity of a lifetime . The guy must read minds ; he snaps his fingers and two cups of coffee appear . He slides yours across the smooth table . You 're afraid to ask for jam . <p> " I 've had my scouts out watching you for a long time and they tell me that you 're finally ready to join up with the big leagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says , and thrusts a piece of paper with his " X " already scrawled in black blood . " It 's easy , " he says . " I 'm giving you the chance to manage the Designated Hater and get back at every SOB who 's ever stood in your way . It works like this . . . . " <p> You 'll live your life , just as you 've always done , except from now on you 'll control the power of divine retribution . You 'll pick some poor schmo to do the dirty work for you , but you 'll choose the targets . <p> " Keeps your hands clean . Plausible Deniability , " he says . " Tons more satisfying than doing the work yourself . Remember that guy in Toledo who went postal after losing his job ? He shot up the place , killed people he 'd been working with for years . Remember how nobody understood why he did it ? The guy himself could n't tell you , but here 's the secret , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my last manager . That 's the beauty of the system . A vicarious thrill . The Designated Hater does the work , takes the risks , eats the stress ; the manager watches it go down , relaxes , thinks up more ideas . For someone like you it 's a win-win situation . " <p> You suddenly understand that random violence is not random , but is contracted out . It all makes perfect sense , now that you know how things work . You lean forward . " So why are you talking to me ? What happened to the last guy ? " <p> " Retired , " he says . " Was with me forty years . Says you can call to chitchat about the job , if you want . " <p> You ca n't help but be interested , but you 've read your share of deal-with-the-devil stories , so you 're understandably cautious . " What 's the catch ? " you ask . <p> " It 's a volunteer position , " he says , " and unless something happens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't think of anything else , other than that . " <p> You tell him , " No . It sounds rather extreme . " He shrugs , and bums some numbers into the tabletop with his breath . " If you change your mind , just give me a fax , " he says . He disappears in a puff of smoke , leaving the contract fluttering above the table . <p> You dear the dishes and shove the paper into the garbage sack . You hurry to the office , but find it impossible to keep your mind on your work . The boss notices you sitting around and gives you a little something extra to work on at home . <p> It takes you four hours to finish that little something . You 're hungry , but all you can find for dinner is a banana that 's gone black . The flesh is soft , so sweet it tastes metallic . You toss the peel into the garbage and  --  almost as an afterthought  --  pick your way through the trash to retrieve the contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read carefully , searching for loopholes , then fold the paper into fourths and slip it into the back of your bureau drawer . <p> You tell yourself , " I 'm not interested , " but you know it 's pretty low when you have to lie to yourself because no one else is there to listen . You struggle to keep from opening that drawer to read the contract over one more time . <p> You picture yourself signing on the dotted line . Your hand goes to your pocket , where your purloined ball-point pen has just leaked and left your new shirt bruised for life . <p> You know that managing the Designated Hater would make life a little easier . Because sometime soon  --  maybe later tonight , maybe not till tomorrow morning  --  someone is going to do something else so stupid it pisses you off , pushes you a little further over the edge . Consider your options . Really , when you think about it , you 're the most qualified applicant around . <p> <p> By Leslie What <p>    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
