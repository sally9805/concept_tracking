<p> When Sharon Hudson returned from Baton Rouge recently , she hauled back provisions : pounds and pounds of Camellia red beans , Louisiana long- grain rice , Tony 's Creole Seasoning and Community Coffee . <p> Eric Greely already is planning a Mardi Gras ball for February , but he needs a bigger room than last year , when 350 crowded Lanier Plaza . <p> Clarence Moritz cranks out a Cajun music show , leads dance lessons and sends a newsletter to hundreds of Atlanta two-steppers . <p> Like a Gulf tide , Louisiana culture keeps washing up in Georgia . In the past 10 years , thousands of Louisianians have come to Atlanta - an exodus forced mainly by the state 's depressed economy . But they have n't left the spice of Louisiana behind . The expatriates gather often over crawfish and zydeco , treating fellow transplants like family , celebrating their roots in one of the nation 's most distinctive provinces . <p> Much of the migration started in the mid- ' 80s , when Louisiana 's oil and gas industry collapsed and unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere else . But Georgia ranks high on the list . A recent study of migration by Atlanta marketer Emily Hubbard found that 26,000 Louisianians moved to Georgia from 1985 to 1988 . Laborers and professionals , bayou Cajuns and big-city blacks , they came because they had to . <p> " There were just better job opportunities in the Atlanta area , " says Erma Freemont of the Southern University Alumni Federation . <p> Atlanta restaurateurs Tony and Missy Privat saw several relatives lose businesses and <p> go bankrupt in the St. Martinville area . " It was best to leave , " she says . " There was no way we could support ourselves and help our families . " <p> Another economic refugee is Andre Comeaux . A former oil and gas industry engineer from Lafayette , he switched careers when times got tough , moving to Atlanta in 1986 and entering the insurance business . <p> Now Mr. Comeaux is president of the 400-member Atlanta alumni club of the University of Southwestern Louisiana . In April , the group put on a crawfish boil for 560 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a zydeco band . <p> Like other Cajuns here , Mr. Comeaux speaks proudly of his heritage , of his people 's joie de vivre . <p> " We try to go out and listen to Cajun music and eat Cajun food . Those are probably the two best instruments to communicate the flavor of what we know . We all carry a piece of home in our hearts . When we get together , we can share it . " <p> Sharing is the currency of the Louisiana Club . With 130 families in the metro area , the group sponsors monthly covered-dish socials where members , wearing name tags that proclaim their hometowns , hit the buffet line for Louisiana dishes , then trade Cajun jokes and Bayou State trivia . They 're already hard at work planning February 's Mardi Gras ball , where , with authentic costumes and a Louisiana band , it 's laissez les bon temps rouler . <p> Let the good times roll . <p> Five families started the club in 1988 at St. Patrick 's Catholic Church in Norcross . While raising funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transplants who feel dislocated . " We bring the warmth of Louisiana over here - a sense of family , " says club president Sharon Hudson . <p> That family feeling is important because the move was traumatic for many Louisianians . <p> Maxie Trahan and her husband , R.C. , are known as Mom and Dad to Louisiana migrants . " We 're the oldest ones who have moved down here , " she says . " We 've just adopted all these kids . " <p> Mrs. Trahan , an administrative assistant for C &S; Bank in Tucker , and Mr. Trahan , a warehouseman for Pacesetter Corp . in Norcross , came to Atlanta in 1988 after they suffered a double whammy : She lost her job at Occidental Chemical in Crowley and then they had to close their feed , seed and fertilizer business . <p> " Every time I go home , I see people losing everything , " Mrs. Trahan says . " I feel sorry for those who are just waiting around , who ca n't make up their minds to leave . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , native Louisianians often feel the need to return for a dose of the real thing . " Our hearts are still there , " says Steve Bartholomew , an Atlanta waiter and bartender . " Everybody I know from Louisiana has been back two or three times every year . " <p> Like Mrs. Hudson , they cart back food from home . Mr. Greely transports coolers of oysters and crawfish : " You ca n't find any good crawfish here . " <p> Madison Foster , a social policy professor at Clark Atlanta University , knows what he means . He and his wife , Judy Chapital , native Louisianians , cook gumbo , which is of African origin , and Creole-style jambalaya and red beans and rice . The Louisianian-in-Atlanta culture is " almost like being a Jamaican in New York in terms of what we cook and going back to Louisiana to find crab , fish , crawfish , " he says . <p> Old sports loyalties do n't die either , as Louisianians strut their colors - gold and black - when the pro football New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over their division-leading team ? " Oh , man , yeah , for sure ! " says Mrs. Hudson , whose club bought 75 tickets to the September game against the Falcons . The team reports that about 30 percent of the crowd at Atlanta-New Orleans games here are Saints fans . <p> The Saints clearly are the Falcons ' biggest rival , says Jeff Van Note , longtime Atlanta player and broadcaster . And with tonight 's game renewing the hostilities , which simmer like a good gumbo , there 's not much divided fan loyalty . " We 're pretty much die-hard Saints fans , " Clarence Moritz says . " Much more than Atlantans are Falcons fans , mostly because we do n't have other professional teams . " <p> Despite enjoying life here , some Louisianians want to retire back home . Liz Lemoine , a paralegal with Chevron Oil in Marietta , would like to live on Bayou Desglaises again someday . " My mother has a big house on the bayou . I guess I 'd like to retire there , sit on the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many rule out a return . Mr. Greely , who coordinates the fund- raising Mardi Gras ball for Southern University and Grambling State University , thinks opportunity for blacks is limited in Louisiana . " If I would n't have got a transfer to Atlanta , I would have left , " he says , citing an " uncomfortable " climate for blacks . Indeed , ex-Klansman David Duke captured a majority of white votes in last weekend 's Louisiana gubernatorial election . <p> " Louisiana is a land apart , " concedes Denis Reggie , a well-known photographer who moved to Atlanta in 1986 . He sees a closed-mindedness in his native state . " When you really get down to it , I think it points back to the lack of a strong education system . " <p> There are two things all Louisianians take pride in : food and music . When expatriates congregate , the subjects are discussed and enjoyed with gusto . <p> Louisianians have " an incredible tolerance for red and cayenne pepper , for seasonings in general , " Mr. Reggie says . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We had tongue shock . We were n't used to such bland food . " <p> The spicy stuff is offered at several Atlanta restaurants . Among them is the French Quarter Food Shop in Midtown , run by the Privats . They met at a cooking school in Lafayette , then eloped to Atlanta in 1987 because of better job prospects . <p> Their restaurant is built around reminders of home , from Mardi Gras masks to Zapp 's potato chips to Al Hirt album covers . New Orleans R &B; and Cajun music add to the ambience . " The accents kick in when people from Louisiana come in , " Mrs. Privat says . <p> She misses the natural beauty of Louisiana . " My brother-in-law is a pilot , and we 'd go fly over the Atchafalaya Basin and you 'd see all the cypress . . . . It 's a scary , wicked beauty . " <p> She and her friends compensate for any homesickness by continuing customs such as playing bourree , a pokerlike card game peculiar to Louisiana , and throwing fais @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . " " Children go to sleep , then it 's time to dance , " Mrs. Privat explains . <p> Atlanta 's king of Cajun culture probably is Mr. Moritz , who found himself staring at a double-digit unemployment rate when he graduated from the University of Southwestern Louisiana in 1986 . He resisted moving at first ; his mother 's side of the family had been in Louisiana since the French Acadians fled Canada in the late 1700s . " It was made easier because so many people were moving at the time , " he says . <p> In Atlanta he found " a totally different culture . " His desire to preserve Cajun heritage drove him to start a radio show on WRFG-FM ( Radio Free Georgia ) . Now the station offers three hours of southern Louisiana music every Sunday : 1 1/2 hours of zydeco , the up-tempo music that combines African-American and Creole French traditions , followed by 1 1/2 hours of Cajun , a folk-sounding French music that reminds some of bluegrass , only with different instruments . <p> Mr. Moritz also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play a triangle and stage dances - all non-profit enterprises , he says . <p> At a Cajun dance last weekend , he mounted the stage at the American Legion hall on Piedmont Avenue and , armed with a whistle , joined a four- member Cajun band imported from Louisiana . The group struck up the " Perrodin Two-Step , " a traditional Cajun French song . <p> Mr. Moritz , like a drum major , commanded the Paul Jones , a popular group dance . When he 'd blow the whistle , scores of dancers would scramble to get new partners , then two-step counterclockwise along the slippery wooden floor until the whistle started another switch . <p> " It 's my culture , " Mr. Moritz says . " One of the last unique cultures in America . " <p> It 's hard to imagine taking the Louisiana out of these people .
