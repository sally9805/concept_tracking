Cowboys do n't cry . It 's , like , this rule . Baseball players did n't cry , either , until they became multimillionaires and began to remove themselves from the lineup every time they felt a little stiffness in a shoulder . To a rodeo cowboy a little stiffness means he 's wearing a cast . We mention this as a sort of history lesson . What baseball was in the days of train travel , skinflint owners , winter jobs , Gehrig , Musial and Campanella , rodeo is now . // Let an 1,800-pound bull smash a rodeo cowboy 's face in the dirt , tap-dance on his rib cage and rearrange his teeth , and he still wo n't cry . He wo n't even complain , unless he ca n't ride his next bull or bronc . A rodeo cowboy does n't get paid unless he 's in the lineup . // Which is why all those fellas with the oversized buckles on their belts and the bandages on their chins were limping around Las Vegas last week , yanking on slot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The National Finals Rodeo was in town again , so it was time to call the paramedics . The NFR in Vegas is the Super Bowl of rodeos , a 10-day cowboy mashing in which every performance is sold out . The top 15 money-winners in each event over the regular season compete at the NFR for a total of $2.7 million and the world championship buckle , which is awarded to the year 's cumulative leader in each event . Honorable mention goes to the guy who does the deepest face plant . // Who turfed the worst this year ? Tough call . Was it three-time world bull-riding champ Tuff Hedeman , who was in fourth place and in good position to win another title until Friday night 's eighth round ( out of 10 ) , when a Brahma named Dodge Magnum Power dumped the cowboy from Bowie , Texas , in the dirt ? Hedeman was taken from the arena on a stretcher , suffering from temporary paralysis . He was found to have a herniated disk in his neck and a bruised spinal cord , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's expected to recover , but it 's almost certain he has ridden his last bull . // Or could it have been Ted Nuce of Escalon , Calif. , the 1985 world bull-riding champion who , moments after Hedeman was hauled off , suffered a terrifying fall off the appropriately named Slam Dunk ? As the bucking bull whipped its head back , one of its horns smashed into Nuce 's face , knocking him unconscious . Nuce then flew high in the air , flipped over and landed like a sack of dog bones . Nuce was also carted off on a stretcher and whisked by ambulance to University Medical Center . It turned out that Nuce had suffered only a cut lip and a concussion . Nonetheless , he stayed in the hospital overnight for observation , and he withdrew from the competition . // Those two falls paved the way for Ty Murray of Stephenville , Texas  --  who this year waltzed to his fifth straight world all-around title , with record earnings of $297,896  --  to take his first bull-riding championship , the first single-event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventh in the saddle bronc and fifth in the bareback . ) Was he shaken when he saw Nuce and Hedeman dragged out of the arena ? " It 's not like it 's a shock to the rest of us when something like that happens , " Murray said . " The danger 's there every time you get on . People have no idea what we do just to get to the NFR. " // But people might have started to get the idea on the very first ride the next night , when Rocky Steagall of Clovis , Calif. , was dumped by a horse named Crow Fairskoal . Writhing in pain , Steagall signaled for help . He , too , was removed on a stretcher , and Dr. J. Pat Evans , the attending physician at the NFR , said that Steagall had suffered a separated shoulder and reinjured his neck . // But the most dramatic fall of the week might have been the swan dive by 1992 world saddle-bronc-riding champion Billy Etbauer in the fourth round . It knocked him clean out . Etbauer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had too much ground to make up to defend his championship successfully , having missed 12 weeks of rodeos after undergoing back surgery in May to remove a ruptured disk . " After being crippled up all that time , I 'm just tickled to be here , " said the irrepressibly upbeat 30-year-old cowboy. // This year was the first since 1990 that an Etbauer did not win the saddle-bronc title . Billy 's older brother , Robert , 32 , who missed the entire year after undergoing two knee surgeries , won in ' 90 and ' 91 . And the youngest Etbauer brother , 28-year-old Danny , was also in contention , finishing fifth this year . The Etbauers ' unofficial fourth brother , Craig Latham of Texhoma , Texas  --  who logs some 120,000 miles a year with the Etbauers while hitting 100 to 125 rodeos  --  did his level best to keep the title in the van , but he was nosed out of the saddle-bronc championship buckle by Dan Mortensen of Manhattan , Mont. , who won $150,062 to Latham 's $142,814 . The Etbauers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being " about as ranchy as you can get "  --  and they should have known it was n't going to be their week when a carload of women pulled up beside them on their way to Wednesday 's performance . Ogling their cowboy hats , one pretty woman signaled for them to roll down a window . Autograph request ? A kiss for luck ? " Hey , do you guys know Garth Brooks ? " the young woman shouted . // " No , ma'am , we do n't , " Dan Etbauer replied . " But you have a nice night , O.K. ? " He cranked up the window , rolled his eyes and muttered , " Holy buckets . " // That was the night that bull rider Charlie Sampson was knocked unconscious and took half a dozen stitches in the chin . Watching this , Dan Etbauer said with admiration , " Charlie broke every bone in his face in front of the president Ronald Reagan a few years back . Then he got his ear clean whacked off . They had to rebuild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronny Sparks of Texarkana , Texas , who won his second straight bullfighting title , is another fella whose body has been through the mill . Bullfighting , for the uninitiated , is a relatively new event in which a bunch of clowns take turns pulling a Pamplona in front of extremely agitated bulls with large horns . The crazier the chances the clowns take , the higher they 're marked . Sparks won after twice getting butted in the rump by a bull named Ice Tea , whose horns were about 12 feet long , and then slapping the beast upside its drooling face while leaning over the side of a clown barrel . What made this derring-do particularly impressive was that during a rodeo on Oct. 20 , Sparks 's right ankle was broken when a bull stepped on it . The ankle was in a cast for three weeks , and Sparks had n't tried to run on it until the NFR . " Your adrenaline 's pumping so hard I never even thought about it , " said the 29-year-old rodeo clown who over the years has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his fibula snapped when he was impaled by a bull 's horn . " They were n't worried about the broken bone , " Sparks recalls . " They were worried about that hole . No tellin ' where that bull 's horn had been . Some nasty places , for sure . " // " In every sport some guys have disregard for pain , " says Dr. Evans , who was once the team physician for the Dallas Cowboys and the NBA 's Dallas Mavericks . " But we see more of this type of guy in rodeo than in any other sport . Part of it is because they ca n't win any money by sitting out . " // But it 's not just money that gets these guys back in the arena when they 're hurt . It 's the rodeo culture . Bareback rider Deb Greenough of Red Lodge , Mont. , who won his first world championship last week , can still remember when he rode his first calf . He was four years old , and it was during the annual spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Greenough blood . Deb 's grandfather Bill , his great-uncle Turk and his great-aunts Marge and Alice all rodeoed . Turk and Alice were world champions in the ' 30s , and Alice , who rode saddle broncs , once performed for the queen of England . // So when four-year-old Deb wanted to ride that calf , no Greenough was shocked . " I can still remember that little  --   --  bucking , " Deb says . " After a little ways I fell off , burst into tears and expected some sympathy . Did n't get any . My dad said , ' Cowboys do n't cry . ' After a little bit I felt better and wanted to ride another one . He would n't let me . Said , ' Nah , you 'll just cry . ' " Deb swore up and down that he would n't cry . Scout 's honor . Dad finally relented . " I do n't remember how long I stayed on that calf , " Deb says , " but I know that when I got bucked off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // That 's the culture . That 's what infects the cowboys ' thinking . That 's why Greenough now suffers from something referred to as tennis-ball arm . His Popeye-sized left biceps is down around his elbow , and there 's a hole where the muscle used to be . A doctor might say that the long head of Greenough 's biceps was torn clean off his shoulder . It happened at a Canadian rodeo in Cloverdale , B.C. , last year when Greenough 's horse hit the fence , and Greenough got hung up between the fence post and his rigging . Something gave in his arm , he was n't sure what . So , naturally , Greenough went on to the next rodeo , felt something give again on his mount 's first jump but ignored it . He rode the horse to the whistle . When he reached down to feel his arm , his biceps was n't there . He could have had surgery to reattach the muscle to the shoulder , but that would have delayed his return . Left to its own devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever it could catch hold . Two months later , he was back rodeoing. // " I thought my rodeoing days were over , " Greenough says now . " I came back with a whole different attitude . I came here with my mind set to win . " // In third place entering the ninth round , Greenough knew he had to make something happen Saturday night . Bruised and sore all over , he sucked it up and put the spurs to a big brawny bucking horse named Laplander . He won the round and $12,002 . That vaulted Deb into the bareback lead , which he maintained on Sunday to win the first world championship in bareback for one of the " riding Greenoughs " in some 60 years . " I cussed myself every jump , saying , ' Get up there , you wimp , and do n't weaken ! ' " an exuberant Greenough said later . " You 've got to keep chewing on yourself . " Of course you do . Pain is mother 's milk to a cowboy.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
