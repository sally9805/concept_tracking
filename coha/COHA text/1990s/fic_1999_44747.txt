Around here we like to mark the start of the baseball season each April . However , as we go to press the baseball fans are still basking in the glow of the exciting 1998 season , and basketball fans are facing the prospect of having no season at all . So our favorite explorer of the magical realms of sports , Rick Wilber , has put aside his split-finger fastball for the fadeaway jumper and given us this moving and personal story of how some forms of truth can be found at the top of the key . <p> JUST TOUCHING HER excited him . Sitting next to her at the morning meetings at WDA &; Associates , accidentally bumping knees or shoes , he found himself getting excited , had to move in his chair to get himself more comfortable . So when she asked him over to her place for lunch yesterday he said yes . He could n't have imagined it any better . They never did get around to eating much of that lunch she 'd made , some chicken and rice thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the slightest contact hip to hip or that light touch on the hand as he helped her with the salad , or that leaning over her from behind , feeling her dark hair against his cheek while they rinsed a couple of glasses at the sink . The tension was electric , was palpable until she broke it with a nervous laugh and asked him if he felt it , too , and that led the two of them into an admittance of things they 'd been hinting at for a month or more now at work . They almost made love . Almost . But Robert , who does n't think of himself as someone like this , who thinks of himself as a lot more down  --  to-earth than this , really , backed away at the last moment , right in step with Alice , who pushed him away , too . They stood there , looking at each other for a long , long minute , saying nothing until Alice finally spoke , said " Oh , Robert . " He was dizzy , felt like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't possibly be real , could n't be him standing there , watching himself watching her . She reached out to touch his face , her fingers brushing his cheek lightly , stopping there for a second before she brought her hand back . " I need to think , Robert . " He nodded , trying to will it all to be real . " Yes , me , too . " " Give me the weekend to think about it , okay ? Maybe we 'll have lunch on Monday or something . " " Sure . Lunch . On Monday . " It was about all he could manage to get said . She laughed awkwardly . " I do n't know , Robert . I 've thought about this so much . I figured I knew what I wanted ; but , it 's just too much right now . Look , you have to go now , Robert , you really have to go . " So he left , slowly calming down , returning to reality . Now , just a couple of hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recollection of it all as he drives to pick up his Down Syndrome older brother Jimmy at the group home , fighting the afternoon traffic to get there in time while he thinks about her , wondering if it all was real . It 's almost like he imagined the whole thing , like it was a dream . He 's tempted to call her just to check his own memory of it . He 's not proud of this , he tells himself , but he feels drawn to her somehow , like some satellite that circles around her , its orbit narrowing until it finally angles in sharply toward her . And burns up as the atmosphere thickens . That 's the problem , all the destruction that is possible here . Today 's little lunch was at her place while her husband was out of town and her kids off in school . Her husband , Robert thinks , and sighs . He 's never met the guy , and is glad of that . And her kids . He shakes his head . Great kids , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmy were at the mall one rainy Saturday afternoon . A boy about ten , and his little sister , a six-year-old as pretty as her mommy . Alice introduced him to them as her friend from work and his brother , and they all chatted politely for a minute about the new Disney movie ( the boy officially found it boring , the girl thought it was wonderful ) before the little girl 's tugs on Mommy 's hand took the family off toward the ice cream shop . Robert walked away slowly from that one , taking Jimmy by the hand then walking back out into the educational cold rain and his Mustang and the drive back to the group home . Jimmy just looked at him as they drove , not saying much at first . Finally , " You like her , my brother ? " he asked . " Yeah , Jimmy . I like her . She 's nice , " Robert said , hoping that would end it . " She has nice kids , " Jimmy said , and smiled , added " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , limbo , " Robert added . " The kids " daddy , you know ? Look , it 's nothing , Jimmy , just do n't worry about it , okay ? Just let it go . " And Jimmy did , or seemed to , just nodding yes and then sitting back and getting quiet again before falling asleep as they drove the last couple of miles to the group home . Alice is a big girl , dammit , Robert tells himself now as he 's driving , and she says the marriage is rocky anyway , that her husband Nick is n't home much anymore and seems to have lost interest in her and all the rest . And , Robert thinks , if she did n't want this , all she had to do was say no . And , Jesus , the excitement , the potential , was so explosive that he could hardly think about anything else . Earlier this morning , at the meeting , he had to force himself to concentrate on the project , about how much money they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars being talked about , millions risked , his career on the line , and what he was thinking about was how her skin might feel against his fingertips as he ran them along her back , her stomach , her breasts . It 's all suddenly moving way too fast for him , his imagination outrunning his reality , like that time in college when he came in off the bench against Ohio State and that Buckeye guard was so quick that Robert felt like his feet were lead , that time had changed somehow so that the guy was zipping by him in some frenzied , perfect , higher speed while Robert could only turn and watch . It was the worst basketball game of his mediocre college career and a nightmare he 's never forgotten . Now , driving along , thinking about what might be about to happen , he 's excited and fearful at the same time . He can hardly breathe . He sucks in air slowly , deeply , trying to gain some control . He 's glad to be picking up Jimmy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can ground him , pull him down from all these light-headed imaginings . Jimmy , he thinks , will slow things down for him . Jimmy knows what 's real and what is n't . To get to Jimmy 's group home Robert has made the seven-mile drive up 66th street . There are one or two lights every mile , and he has caught them all at red , every single one of them , and this is tourist season to boot , so the drive has taken nearly forty minutes , with Robert mumbling curses at the Ontario and Ohio plates the whole way , watching from behind , frustrated , as those gray heads bob in their huge , maroon Buicks , ambling toward wherever they are going on a Friday afternoon in Florida in March . But now he 's finally here . He shakes his head , takes another deep breath , trying to bring the world into focus as he pulls into the driveway of the Samuel Crockett Independent Living Facility , Jimmy 's group home . Jimmy , dressed in gray slacks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smiling cow on it that he likes so much , waits on the bench that sits outside the group home 's front door , staring off into the distance . He has his favorite little athletic bag with him , the black one with the red Chicago Bulls emblem on it . Jimmy is a real Bulls fan . Robert likes the Celtics . It is a historic point of contention between the two . Robert stops the Mustang by the bench , hits the power window switch and leans over that way to give Jimmy a shout . " Hey , Jimbo . Ready to go , pal ? " Jimmy just looks over at him , slowly , his face in that serious expression he gets sometimes , eyes narrowed , mouth tight . Something 's going on . Then Jimmy seems to notice it 's Robert and the whole world brightens . " Hey , Roberto . What 's going on , my brother ? You okay " " Yeah , Jim , I 'm fine . Sorry I 'm a little late , brother , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Man , these tourists ! " " Yeah , " Jimmy says , opening the door and slowly easing himself in . " Yeah , these tourists ! " Then he settles in , clicks the seatbelt into place , and looks at his younger brother . " You are late , my brother . I love you and I like you , but Mom said three-thirty o'clock and it is , " he looks at his digital watch , " three-forty o'clock , my brother . That is late . We hurry now , okay ? I ca n't miss it , confession . " Robert smiles . Time matters to Jimmy , seems to give him a sense of order , of organization , something he can control , so it 's not surprising that he 's a little upset that Robert is late . Robert tries to explain it away . " Like I said , Jimmy , I 'm sorry . It was bad traffic , you know ? Lots of cars going slow . " Jimmy just nods , and slips back into the staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mustang back onto the main road , heading south on 66th Street , back toward Holy Innocents and confession . Every Friday at four in the afternoon Robert does this , takes Jimmy to confession . It 's important enough that he juggles his lunch hours all week to do it , building up enough time that he can get out early on Friday , pick up Jimmy and get him over to Father Curran in his little booth . The first light is green as they approach it , then goes amber and then red as they pull up to the broad white line marking the intersection . " Damn , " Robert says , downshifting . " I not like it when you say that word , my brother , " says Jimmy , coming out of his reverie long enough to let Robert know that he 's listening . Robert just smiles , thinking Jimmy will probably add it to his list for confession - " Heard a bad word from my brother . " Probably get him another Hail Mary . Robert looks over and Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving along that almost instantly lulls Jimmy into a half-sleep , a kind of meditative state . Over the years since Dad 's death Robert has seen this hundreds of times , the peaceful look on that wide face , the flattened nose , the folds around the eyes . There 's a slight drool from the mouth as Jimmy mumbles in his sleep . God , Robert loves this guy . He 's never understood how brothers could not get along , though he 's heard it from his friends all his life , about the fights some brothers have , about how they drift apart over the years , never talking , not really knowing each other 's successes and failures . That 's not the way things are with Robert and Jimmy , not even close . The kid needs him , damnit , and Robert 's gotten a lot in return , too . The love he gets from Jimmy is amazing the hugs and devotion , the joy . Jimmy takes his responsibilities as the older brother very seriously . Back in high school when Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High to its best season in years , Jimmy was there at almost every game , home and away , cheering his brother on , telling everyone just who that was out there hitting those three-pointers , finishing up with a slam on the fastbreaks . One game , against Cleveland High , Jimmy was sick and had to stay home . Robert was awful that night , hitting just one of eight from the field , giving up four turnovers , playing miserably the whole time . It was the only league game they lost all year , and Robert was the reason . He capped off the awful night by missing a pair of free throws with four seconds left when he could have tied the score . Jimmy blamed the loss on himself . Robert came home with the news and found Jimmy , flu and . all , waiting up for him . " I stunk it up , Jimbo , " Robert told him . " I mean I was really awful . " " I so , so sorry I not there for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never again , okay ? I promise , I always be there for you . " " Sure , Jimmy , you 'll always be there , " Robert said , worn out and depressed , though never too tired to talk to Jimmy . That was fifteen years ago now , and seems even longer , but Jimmy still protects his baby brother . They 're within a block of Holy Innocents , so it 's time to wake Jimmy up . Robert reaches over and shakes him gently on the knee . " Hey , Jimmy , time to wake it up , pal . We 're almost there . " Jimmy stirs , those eyes open slowly . He smiles . " Holy Innocents ? " " That 's it , Holy Innocents , Jimbo . Confession time . " Then Robert laughs as he makes the turn into the wide driveway of the church and heads up toward the parking area . " Hey , brother , " he adds , " what 's the big sin ? You been messing around with the girls lately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert for a moment , his face contorted , like he 's struggling to find the words to say something . Then he gives it up , just smiles , says , " I not tell you , Robert . It is my confession , and I need it , that is all . " Whew , Robert thinks , serious stuff here . But what could be serious for Jimmy ? The kid - hell , he is in his mid-thirties now but Robert still thinks of him as a kid - is as innocent as new snow , there just are n't any sins possible for Jimmy . They pull into the space closest to the side door of the church . There are no other cars in the lot . " C'm on , brother , " Robert says , " it ca n't be that serious , can it ? What happened ? Tell your little brother and maybe I can help , eh ? " Jimmy just stares , though , then slowly shakes his head and looks out the car window as Robert comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parking brake . Then , while Robert watches , puzzled-can this quiet , worried guy be his brother Jimmy ? - Jimmy gets out and walks into the church . Robert sits back to wait . It takes maybe ten minutes , no more , and then Jimmy comes walking out , smiling now , obviously happier . " Hey , my brother , I better now . " " Father Curran have some good advice for you , limbo ? " Jimmy looks at him , shakes his head . " This is confession , Robert , I not tell you . It is private . " Robert smiles , shoves the Mustang into reverse , - pulls out of the spot and then heads for 66th street and the drive back north to the group home . But when they get to the intersection to make that turn , Jimmy says , " Hey , Robert . Let 's play it some basketball , okay ? Me and you , brother , one on one . " Robert smiles . The two of them have been shooting hoops like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ongoing ritual , in Robert 's mind , a frequent reminder of their connection to each other . Occasionally , it 's even more than that , like the time Dad died in that stupid car wreck . Coming home late from work , a summer thunderstorm with that torrent of heat-driven rain so thick you ca n't see where you 're going , a little mistake on the interstate just where the bridge comes down from its elevated ramp over the waters of the bay onto that long stretch of fill land . A little mistake , some sliding , some banging and crunching with that other car and that semi and that was that , off into the bay . There 's only ten feet of water at that spot , Robert went out into it one day to see for himself . Did some skin-diving on that exact spot . But ten feet deep is all it takes when the car is on its side and you 're trapped in there and no one can see where the car is and that , Robert remembers , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of months later , looking through his father 's stuff from his office desk , Robert found out that Dad was making it with some woman , someone who signed her letters Licia . He never told Jimmy , or Mom , about what he found . But Jimmy has a strange way of figuring things out , of sensing them somehow , and it all came out later in one of their brotherly basketball games , Jimmy winning like Robert always makes sure he does , and then Jimmy standing there , sweating in the late summer sun , crying hard , sobbing , saying stuff about Dad , about Mom , about Dad and women and what was going on . Robert , to this day , has no idea how the kid could have come up with it , but he did . All this recollection and more , of the funeral , of the legal hassle , of the polite well-wishers and the money troubles and all the rest , flashes by in an instant when Jimmy mentions shooting the ball around , and then Robert says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got my stuff in the trunk , what about you ? " " I brought it my stuff , Robert . I am a ready guy . Let 's shoot it some hoops . " " Okay , okay , Jimbo , but I got to warn you , I 'm going to thump you good this time , pal . I 'm due . " Jimmy laughs , " You watch it , my brother . Be a good sport , okay ? " And Robert laughs with him . They are only a few minutes away from the Pass-a-grille courts , the ones in the little park across the street from the main beach , just up from the Hurricane Restaurant , the one where Dad first met that Licia woman , from what Robert read in those letters . The off-shore breeze is blowing pretty good as they park , open the trunk and get out the ball and Robert 's shoes and shorts and walk over to the court . Jimmy has a great little jump shot , he 's been a big star at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be much outside shooting today , Robert thinks , as the two of them sit down on the bench and start putting on their shorts and shoes . Jimmy laces his shoes up tight , and has that look on his face , so Robert knows this one is serious . Somehow , Robert figures , this connects up to going to confession , and Father Curran , and Holy Innocents and god knows what else , but Robert has no idea how or why . Before Robert has finished lacing his first shoe , Jimmy is done and walking out toward the basket , dribbling the ball five times with his right hand and then five times with his left , the way his father taught him all those years ago . Dad was a heck of a player , was a starter in college , a forward for the Golden Gophers at Minnesota . Robert has a framed picture of his dad from those playing days , that long right arm reaching up and out toward the rim , his body rising for a layup on a fastbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them reduced to watching . The picture shows his father 's certainty , at least for that moment . Robert inherited some of those talents , enough of them to sit on the bench in college at any rate and get a free education in the bargain . That 's more than most guys can say . And Jimmy ? Well , hell , Down Syndrome or not , he can play this game . Robert remembers watching Jimmy play in one Special Olympics game a couple of years back where the other team had some pretty good players and Jimmy 's team really had only Jimmy . Jimmy scored twenty-eight points in that game in a losing cause , keeping his team in the game with a series of steals that led to layups , and with a nifty little turn-around jumper that he hit seven or eight times . It was only in the last few minutes that the poor kid , worn out , just could n't keep up the pace . Robert was so proud of his brother that he ran onto the court after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jimmy was embarrassed by that since his team , after all , had lost . Jimmy 's ready to play , so Robert finishes lacing them up and joins him on the court . Robert takes a couple of jumpers to loosen up , stretches out a bit doing a couple of toe touches and a few windmills with his arms , and then they go at it . Jimmy opens the game with a furious drive , dribbling right past Robert and then laying it in for two . Robert , still not really loose and ready to play , is surprised by his brother 's intensity . So that 's the way it 's going to be , eh ? He responds with a soft jumper from the free-throw line that goes cleanly through the net . Tie game . It goes on like this for a while , the two of them playing even as they hit the ten-point mark , the fourteen , the sixteen-point mark in a game to twenty . Robert , of course , is really a much better player and so controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Special Olympics , is not nearly as quick or as strong as Robert , and so would lose every game if they played straight up . But Robert has n't played Jimmy straight up in fifteen years , not since they were just kids . Robert has always figured that Jimmy faces plenty of losses in life every day and does n't need any from his brother , so Robert always makes sure that Jimmy wins these brotherly games . Then , afterward , they 'll head over to Tastee Freeze for some ice cream so they can celebrate Jimmy 's big victory . Robert keeps it close every time , making sure he misses at critical moments , or that he has just the right lapse on defense to let Jimmy score a critical layup or two . Then , usually , toward the end of the game Robert takes a lead , then lets Jimmy make a dramatic comeback and win the game . This is always cause for jubilation from Jimmy , arms outstretched in joy , that round face grinning before he runs over to shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him what a good player he is and too bad he could n't win it . Robert always just smiles . Good old Jimmy . And this game goes that way , too , though Jimmy is working so hard , trying so hard , that Robert almost feels bad about not playing it dead seriously . He ca n't recall Jimmy putting this much into it in a long , long time . At the end , Jimmy hits a long jumper , out from behind the three-point line , to win it , but then there is nothing of that victory dance that Robert is used to seeing , none of the joy . Instead , Jimmy tosses the ball to Robert and says , " Okay , brother , let 's play again . You try harder now , okay ? " And so Robert does try harder , putting a little more into the acting , making sure that he looks like he 's really trying , making the victory worthwhile for Jimmy.This one is close , too , a one or two-basket margin the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty mark . Robert really gets caught up in it , lost in the game , putting a move on Jimmy here and there , hustling by his brother for a rebound , hitting that outside jumper consistently . Then , toward the end , Robert backs in on Jimmy , protecting the ball as he moves in toward the goal , getting ready to take a little turn-around fadeaway jumper that should end it . He finds his spot , gives a little head fake to the left and then spins around off the right leg and jumps . Perfect . But Jimmy has backed off him , not gone for the fake and is up in the air , trying for a block . He 's reaching , straining upward , soaring higher and higher as the ball leaves Robert 's fingertips.Jimmy gets there , slaps the ball away and then both brothers come down , sneakers squeaking against the hot pavement . How did Jimmy do that ? The kid can not jump , he 's never gotten up that high in his life . But there it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face him . All right , then , this one 's for real . Jimmy gives a little fake to his left , then pulls up for the jumper . Robert comes at him and jumps to block it , but Jimmy does n't leave his feet and , instead , stays down , puts the ball on the court to dribble and blows by Robert , heading toward the basket . Robert watches , hung up there , useless , as Jimmy goes by , and then , as Robert comes back down he turns to see Jimmy , this thirty-three-yearold Down 's kid , take a final dribble and grab the ball with both hands and plant both feet and then jump , up and toward the rim , soaring from underneath , straining getting his fingertips over the rim , then his whole hand , then up past the wrist and slamming the ball home , a thunderous dunk , to win it . Jesus Christ . Robert does n't know what else to say . A dunk ? By Jimmy ? Robert just stands there as Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabs the ball , turns to face his brother . " I win , " he says , simply . Robert wonders if he just imagined all that . It has , after all , been that kind of day , one filled with vivid imaginings . Maybe it never happened , maybe it was just a layup , just another nice shot . " I win , but you tried hard , my brother . Good game . " And Jimmy holds out his right hand for a game-ending handshake . " Yeah , Jimbo . I tried hard , I always try hard . " Robert shakes his head , then reaches out to take Jimmy 's hand . " Did you just ... 3 " " I win it , my brother . I beat you . " " Yeah , Jimmy , you sure did . " Robert is still replaying it , convincing himself now that it was just his imagination . God knows he 's having trouble enough with that lately anyway . " Father Curran says I have a good " magination , Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tells me I have a good " magination . " What are you talking about ? " Jimmy stands there , dead serious , ball in his right hand , squinting in the hard , bright sun . " At confession , I tell Father Curran my sins and he tells me I have a good " magination and say two Hail Marys . " " What did you confess , Jimbo ? " Jimmy just shrugs . " Father Curran says I should talk to my brother Robert about this . Father Curran says " magination is fine , but not to get it confused with real stuff . " " Yeah , well , that 's good advice , Jimmy . Do n't get it confused . " Robert nods . " I thought so , " he says . And then , and as Robert stands there , puzzling through all this , Jimmy walks over and pats him on the back . " You a smart guy , my brother . You got it ? " " Yeah , Jimmy , sure . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does or not . " Good man , " Jimmy says , and then walks over to where they 've left their towels . Robert , though , does n't walk that way . Instead , he stands there , looking at the rim , until Jimmy yells at him . " C'm on , my brother . It is over now , right ? Time for ice cream . " " Yeah , Jimmy , right , " says Robert , replaying it all one more time , seeing Jimmy soaring in for that slam . " Yeah , " he says finally , turning away from the basket , turning to face his brother . " You 're right . You 're absolutely right . It 's over . " And the two brothers head for some ice cream . - for Jim Smith 1947-1996
