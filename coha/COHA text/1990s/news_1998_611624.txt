<p> Commuters idled for thousands of hours in traffic jams . Engineers spent millions of dollars on dozens of studies . Politicians debated for a decade . Road crews patched and prayed , and all the while , the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge was crumbling . Now its future is in the hands of Congress . <p> Leaders on Capitol Hill are expected to decide by the end of May how much money the federal government , which owns the bridge , will put toward a replacement , estimated to cost $ 1.6 billion . The new bridge is supposed to relieve congestion at the region 's worst traffic choke point , where the Capital Beltway crosses the Potomac River between Alexandria and Prince George 's County . <p> When the Wilson Bridge opened in December 1961 , it was the first direct link between Washington 's Maryland and Virginia suburbs across the Potomac . No one expected it to become part of a major commuter route or a vital link in Interstate 95 , the East Coast 's busiest superhighway . <p> State and local leaders warn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to handle future traffic ( projected to grow from 190,000 to 275,000 vehicles a day by 2020 ) , it will cheat both the region and the nation . <p> " This is a federal responsibility , " said Maryland Transportation Secretary David L. Winstead . " It probably is the major bottleneck on the East Coast . There are national interests at stake here . " <p> Dreaded by commuters , tourists and truckers alike , the bridge 's rush-hour backups regularly extend for miles in both directions , as eight lanes of Beltway traffic squeeze into six lanes . The Wilson is a drawbridge , and traffic also backs up when it is opened so pleasure boats and commercial ships can pass . <p> Not only is the bridge congested from carrying too many cars and trucks , it also is literally disintegrating  --  its pavement pockmarked , its steel structure weakening under the pounding . Engineers and safety experts agree that it is just six years from the end of its useful life , badly in need of replacement . <p> If there 's not enough money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trucks that can use the Wilson , or ban trucks altogether . But that could have dramatic effects on traffic elsewhere and on the local economy . <p> " The realistic choice is to say , ' That is not enough to do the job , ' and then to make the necessary plans , difficult as they are , to ultimately post the bridge for weight limits , " said John Milliken , a lawyer and former Virginia transportation secretary . " That 's a horrible alternative . But if you do n't have the funds to build for the volume that the bridge has got to carry , you have no choice . " <p> About 20,000 trucks a day could be diverted from the Beltway into the District on already congested highways such as Interstates 395 and 295 , onto Route 301 in Prince George 's County , or over the American Legion Bridge through Montgomery County . And local delivery trucks could be forced to take the longer routes , too , potentially raising the price of everything from groceries to gasoline . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes when you look out there , there really is doom , " said Charles A. Dukes Jr. , a Carey Winston/Barrueta commercial real estate executive who heads the transportation committee of the Greater Washington Board of Trade . <p> As congressional leaders begin meeting about the bridge as part of their deliberations on a national transportation spending bill , leaders in the two houses are far apart . <p> The House has provided no money for the bridge in its new six-year , $ 217 billion federal transportation program . Sen. John W. Warner ( R-Va. ) , the main champion of the bridge , managed to get the Senate to include $ 900 million in its $ 214 billion bill , $ 700 million short of what 's needed . A committee of lawmakers from both houses of Congress will decide the fate of funding for a replacement bridge . <p> Chances are there will be some money for the bridge when the committee meets , Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott ( R-Miss. ) predicted in an interview last week . But no one knows yet how much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that room , and with the magnitude of that bridge , and you know how important it is to this region , that something will be in the final version , " he said . <p> The 12-Lane Solution <p> In September 1996 , a panel of local , state and regional leaders came up with a plan for a new bridge that would be big enough to carry the amount of traffic expected in the next century . It was chosen over several other proposals for bridges and even an expensive tunnel . <p> The plan calls for side-by-side drawbridges , with six lanes in each direction and stretching to a width of 244 feet . That would make the new Wilson the widest long-span bridge in the world , 107 feet wider than the American Legion Bridge . Included in the price tag are improvements in four interchanges , two in Maryland and two in Virginia , used by a majority of today 's bridge traffic . <p> Such a bridge would accommodate future rush-hour car-pool lanes in both directions ( eventually linking to car-pool lanes on the Beltway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic and include a pedestrian and bike path along the southern edge . <p> A far-right lane on each span would be available for traffic entering or exiting at Route 1 or Interstate 295 and would considerably improve safety , traffic planners say . With no merge lanes and no shoulders , the accident rate on today 's Wilson Bridge is twice the rate elsewhere on the Beltway , officials say . <p> The drawbridge would sit 70 feet over the river , 20 feet higher than the current bridge . The design calls for a drawbridge so that big seagoing craft , including military vessels , commercial ships and ceremonial sailing ships , could continue to reach the Alexandria and D.C. waterfronts . <p> Officials considered but rejected an even higher bridge that would have eliminated the need for a draw span . The steep grade required would have been difficult for trucks to climb and could have slowed traffic , analysts said . Alexandria also objected strongly to the higher bridge , which would have towered over the city 's Old Town . <p> The height of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 220 now scheduled each year . A majority of the openings are to allow pleasure boats to pass . <p> About 30 percent of current openings are for commercial ships , all but a few for freighters heading to and from Robinson Terminal , an Alexandria waterfront newsprint storage and distribution firm owned by The Washington Post Co . A cruise ship also uses the Alexandria docks several times each summer . <p> The drawbridge option adds $ 67 million to the cost of the bridge span , plus about $ 1 million annually in operations and maintenance costs . <p> On the Virginia side , the massive width of the bridge would cover part of one of Alexandria 's most popular parks and require the demolition of more than 300 apartment units and a dozen businesses . The proposal has prompted a lawsuit by Alexandria officials . <p> Fearing that the new bridge would increase traffic and noise during and after construction , officials of the historic port city of 117,000 residents are seeking to stop the plans for a replacement bridge until the full impact on the city is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough consideration to a narrower , 10-lane bridge , which they say would require smaller and simpler interchanges and would have less impact on Alexandria . <p> " When so much is being asked of one community for the sake of a regional improvement , the region must be willing to give fair consideration to the views of the affected community , " said Alexandria Mayor Kerry J. Donley . <p> Supporters of the 12-lane design say that it is needed to meet future traffic demands and that it allows for better flow by separating local from express lanes . They predict Alexandria 's opposition will fail . <p> " The work that has been done as background for the design decision has been proper and right , " said John Gerner , who heads the project for the Federal Highway Administration . " We feel all the issues have been properly considered . " <p> Alexandria gets little sympathy from some of the 78,000 commuters who twice daily put up with miles of traffic backups as they try to negotiate today 's narrow bridge . <p> " It 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else to have theirs . It 's close to buying a house under an existing airport and then objecting to it . People knew the bridge was there , " said John Onchman , 52 , of Waldorf , a government consultant who works in Springfield and crosses the bridge daily . " There are going to be winners and losers whatever they do . " <p> The Growing Overload <p> Built for $ 14 million with a lightweight metal-grill drawbridge , the Wilson Bridge was praised in an engineering journal of the early 1960s for the " simplicity , unity and continuity " of its lines . It was also designed to handle 75,000 vehicles a day , 30,000 more than the volume when it was built . <p> Few dreamed that traffic volumes on the Beltway would reach today 's levels when the Wilson Bridge was dedicated almost 37 years ago . Most everyone thought much of the region 's traffic would be carried on a stretch of I-95 that was to be built right through the middle of the District . The suburbs were conveniently contained inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each morning . <p> But protests stopped I-95 's route through Washington , sending its traffic onto the Beltway . The suburbs exploded far beyond their old limits , and commuters started traveling between suburbs via the ring road . It transformed the Beltway from a bypass around the city into the area 's Main Street . <p> Today , with traffic loads at more than twice its capacity , the Wilson Bridge is suffering . Regular inspections show that the bridge is still safe , but it suffers from " excessive loading " and " fatigue " in engineers ' parlance  --  which means that too many cars and trucks cross the bridge and that it 's wearing out . About 15,000 more cars are crossing the bridge each day than there were just two years ago . <p> About 15 percent of the vehicles are trucks , and therein lies the bridge 's special problem . Every time a heavy truck crosses , the supporting structure holding up the bridge shakes , leading to cracks , bent rods , loose bolts and nuts . The vibrations can actually bend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paper clip several times in opposite directions , say engineers . Eventually the paper clip snaps in two . <p> Federal funds pay for bridge repairs . Virginia currently is shoring up the bridge supports and resurfacing the roadway , but such never-ending maintenance operations are not cost effective , analysts say . Costs continue to rise , and eventually the entire bridge would have to be rehabilitated , requiring several lanes to be closed for a year or two . <p> " The cost to maintain the structure ends up being so overwhelming that it 's no longer advantageous to keep it , " the highway administration 's Gerner said . <p> Although a new bridge will relieve today 's congestion , it will not necessarily speed future trips for commuters , engineers say . Beltway traffic is projected to increase 45 percent in the next 20 years , so the greater capacity of a new bridge will make rush hours then about like they are today . <p> On the other hand , if a new bridge is n't built , commuters can expect eight-mile backups routinely at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , morning and evening , the analysts say . <p> Pressing Ahead <p> Even without financing in place , engineers have begun the design process leading up to construction , which could begin as early as 2000 . <p> Seven design firms have responded to requests for proposals . Each was given $ 100,000 in federal highway grant money to begin developing plans . They will compete later this year for the job of designing the finished product , which would include two spans and a drawbridge with a height of 70 feet . Officials also have specified that the bridge design incorporate some kind of arches to echo other federal city motifs . <p> " After the design contest is over , by the end of this year , then we 'll be able to give a more definitive idea of how the construction will proceed , " said Maryland 's chief bridge engineer , Earl " Jock " Freedman , who predicts that construction will be extremely complicated , given that there is little vacant land to store materials or stage construction on the Virginia shoreline . <p> Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can seek bids from builders . <p> The first step probably will be construction of watertight boxes in the river , which will then be pumped free of water to provide a dry environment for building the bridge pilings . <p> Called cofferdams , the boxes will be built during the winter to protect Potomac River grasses from silt damage , engineers say . Ideally , construction on the dams will begin in the fall of 2000 . <p> The Alexandria waterfront is likely to be home to a fleet of construction barges for years as the bridge goes up , and a rail spur in northern Old Town that leads to the Robinson Terminal dock could also provide access for materials . <p> Hundreds of bridge workers will be descending on the job site . According to a Federal Highway Administration formula , 7,900 jobs  --  for welders , steel and concrete specialists and other workers  --  are created directly by every $ 1 billion spent on a project , though not all of them are at the site . In addition , an estimated 19,700 other jobs making supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Financial Hurdle <p> When construction funding for the first Wilson Bridge was decided in 1954 , lawmakers earmarked $ 15 million , but it would take at least 100 times that much to build the 12-lane replacement . The bridge would be transferred from federal ownership to a regional authority made up of representatives from Maryland , Virginia and the District . <p> Assuming Congress does not finance the full construction cost , some of the remaining money would come directly from the states . The rest could come from other financing plans that have been developed by state and federal officials over the past year . <p> One plan under serious discussion would allow a bridge authority to sell construction bonds that would be backed and paid off by the federal government . <p> " We need this innovative financing added to this act , " said Virginia Transportation Secretary Shirley Ybarra . " It is the best option we 've come up with . " <p> The method is unusual enough to raise some eyebrows on Capitol Hill , though it has been used to finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 's international space station project . <p> Once Congress decides on its share , the states will have to decide whether the money is enough to begin moving forward with construction . <p> Federal highway officials agree that there are places to scale back the design , shoulders to trim , extra asphalt that could be pared down , and interchanges , which range in cost from $ 115 million to $ 320 million apiece , that could shrink . <p> But so far , the states have also taken the position that they will settle for nothing less than full federal funding of the bridge span , and no less than the normal 80 percent federal funding of the interchanges . <p> Backers of a new bridge say the only alternative is forcing trucks onto other highways that run through other communities . Bruce Orkin , 43 , of Bethesda , a surgeon who moved to the area nine years ago , understands what that would mean to him and his Montgomery County neighbors . <p> " If traffic is diverted , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmare , " he said .
