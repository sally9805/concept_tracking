<p> Fifty toy designers , marketers and salespeople at Mattel Inc. crowded into a conference room in June 1989 , summoned by Cathy Larson , director of marketing for the company 's large dolls division . On the walls were large drawings of Hasbro Inc. ' s Cabbage Patch Kids , set inside red circles , slashes drawn through them . The theme from Mission : Impossible was playing . <p> " Your mission , should you decide to accept it , " Larson told the toymakers , was to go after Cabbage Patch , the doll whose grip on girls ' desires - and parents ' wallets - has been unmatched since its debut in 1983 . <p> The Cabbage Patch Defense mapped out at Larson 's meeting was simply a good offense : Come up with a doll that appealed to kids the way Cabbage Patch did . Seven months later - lightning speed for the toy industry - they 'd done it : the Magic Nursery doll , retailing for $ 25 and guaranteed to make girls feel like real mommies . Mattel has sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nursery one of the few stars of a lackluster Christmas . <p> Tell your child her Magic Nursery doll came from Santa , or from grandma , or from her infant brother . But where Magic Nursery really came from is the new idea factory at Mattel , - considered one of the best in the business . <p> Mattel gets more than 65% of its money from girls ' toys , including more than $ 600 million a year from that fabulous 31-year-old , Barbie . Obviously , it has a pretty good handle on what little girls want . And what little girls want is to play with dolls . A successful doll " takes a basic play pattern and puts a new twist on it , " Larson says . <p> Make that new , new , new . " You have to have the play pattern , but magic is what amazes kids , " says Senior Vice President Diana Troup , who heads girls ' toy design . Cabbage Patch thrilled girls because the toy 's adoption certificate helped them believe the doll was really their baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes wearing a bonnet and a hospital robe made of a special paper . At home , when the little girl immerses the robe in water - Mattel suggests chanting " Love is magic ! " at the same time - it dissolves , revealing a plastic-wrapped birth certificate that proclaims " It 's a Boy ! " or " It 's a Girl ! " Also in the plastic packet : a doll outfit , a baby book , and bracelets for the doll and child . <p> Like Cabbage Patch , Mattel went to great lengths to make each Magic Nursery doll seem unique : There are four eye colors , four hair colors , six hair styles and 12 outfits , not to mention innie vs. outie bellybuttons . ( Mattel says the possible combinations are in the " zillions " ; in fact , there are 4,608 . ) And just as in life , every so often the birth certificate says : " It 's Twins ! " The child then sends the certificate to Mattel to receive a second doll . - So far , Mattel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , Magic Nursery was a completely different doll . In May 1989 , free-lance toy inventor George Dunsay came to Mattel with a sample of dissolvable paper and an idea for a ragamuffin doll with a tattered dress and tear-stained face . The child would wipe away the tears and wash the ragged clothes , which would dissolve to reveal a beautiful dress . Ta da ! A homeless orphan is rescued . <p> Bummer , said Mattel designer Lili Davidson , a former greeting-card designer who also handled the P.J. Sparkles doll . She sketched dozens of variations of the ragamuffin 's face . " There were about 60 drawings of crying babies , and it was really depressing , " she says . Though it designed the ragamuffin doll and even tested it in focus groups , Mattel eventually decided a row of orphans on a Toys R Us shelf would be too grim . Then Larson mentioned a recent trip to a hospital nursery - and how charming the rows of babies were even when they were anonymous . " It was like this light bulb came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week before the ragamuffin was to be presented to Jill Barad , Mattel co-president , for approval , - the marketers settled on a happier doll and a happier surprise : discovering whether the baby is a boy or a girl . <p> The designers started over again , at top speed . " It was just , ' Drop everything , this is it , ' " says Davidson . " It was one of the most tiring times of my life , but also exhilarating . " Davidson gave the soft-bodied doll " a big butt , so it could sit up , " and a plastic bellybutton , " because there 's something so damn cute about a bellybutton on a baby . " And , in contrast to Cabbage Patch , " I wanted to make the doll pretty . " <p> The designers met regularly with other departments to make sure the toy- in-progress would n't be too hard or too expensive to manufacture and would meet safety standards . The bellybutton , for example , can withstand 20 pounds of pull without coming off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sewed into robes in humidity-controlled rooms by seamstresses tested for the clamminess of their palms - was n't dangerous , Davidson ate some of it . But she skipped the sessions where Magic Nursery was previewed for key customers . " It 's a piece of merchandise to them . And it 's my baby . " <p> Davidson knew Magic Nursery would be a success when she kept wanting to play with it . But how do you design success in the first place ? " Remembering what delighted you as a kid , " says Troup , who spent her childhood drawing elaborate ball gowns . " It 's remembering all that fantasy . " <p> Troup does n't worry about flops - in fact she cheerfully admits to her biggest bomb , a Barbie with a mechanical Magic Camera . " What I worry about is getting the idea - lying there at night and thinking , ' I do n't have anything . ' They say , ' We 've got to do $ 600 million worth of business and you 've got to come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas on the freeway , in the shower , in the middle of the night . They read the results of Mattel 's endless focus groups and market research . " We get pretty general direction from marketing ( executives ) and then we blue-sky a lot , " Troup says of the 77 girls ' toy designers . ( A team of designers is devoted solely to Barbie , her friends and her enormous wardrobe - but members rotate to avoid Barbie burnout . ) Mattel designers attend fashion shows , cruise the malls and keep an eye on street fashion . Designer Linda Bennett patterned a hot-pink and acid-green dress for another Mattel doll after a T-shirt design she bought at L.A. 's trendy Venice Beach . Designer Janet Mills steals the funky hair accessories her 11-year-old daughter brings home , repaying her in Girl Scout cookie orders . <p> Mattel would n't say how much it spent developing Magic Nursery ; analysts estimate less than $ 5 million , about average for a non-Barbie doll . ( Like most toy companies , Mattel spends about 4% of revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and development . ) But Mattel went all out to make sure Magic Nursery would be a hit .  --  The doll was tested and retested , right down to whether children liked the innie or the outie bellybutton . To get kids into stores , Mattel threw 1,500 baby showers in toy stores , demonstrating the doll for little girls , hiring magicians to entertain and giving away balloons and bubblegum cigars . <p> So far , it seems to have worked . Magic Nursery is the buzz among little girls . When Target , Dayton Hudson Corp . ' s discount chain , advertised a Magic Nursery sale in November , 43,500 dolls flew out of the stores in one weekend , far more than expected . ( Target sells the infant and toddler versions for $ 20.99 and $ 25.99 , respectively ; they were on sale for $ 16.61 and $ 20.61 . ) <p> But in the conference rooms at Mattel that 's old news - as are Magic Nursery pets , clad in their own dissolving robes , which will be in stores early next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new , new , new - for 1992 . CUTLINE : NO CHILD 'S PLAY : Lili Davidson , left , Cathy Larson and Linda Bennett wrestle with various ideas in the process of designing hot-selling toys such as Mattel 's Magic Nursery dolls .
