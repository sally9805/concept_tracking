Section : US News ; Cover story Showdown in the Gulf Facing new enemies , the U.S. may need new weapons and tactics <p> Dateline : Saudia Arabia <p> In the first real test of whether the U.S. military has what it takes to cope with the post-cold-war world , the stars of the show are not $600 million Stealth bombers , $1 million-apiece radar-guided AMRAAM missiles or any of the other high-tech showpieces the Pentagon bought when the name of the game was staying one technological jump ahead of the Soviets . The stars of Operation Desert Shield are some drab , ungainly ships that the Navy had to be forced to buy from a commercial shipping line a decade ago . As these fast logistics ships began arriving last week in Saudi Arabia and unloading the first M1 tanks and other heavy armor to reach the front , one lesson was already becoming clear : In the new world America faces , all the advanced technology and sophisticated weaponry in the world is useless if you ca n't get it to the scene of the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says one Army official , " is that it has taken us too long to get there . ' <p> The new paradigm . Whether or not a shooting war ever starts , Saddam Hussein 's blitzkrieg into Kuwait and the movement of more than a billion pounds of equipment to the searing Saudi desert already has become a critical test of America 's ability to meet the military challenges of the future . Gone are many of the assumptions that guided military strategy for four decades ; gone are the assurances that the U.S. would have the forces where it needed them most . And even though America will have to keep one eye on Soviet strategic nuclear forces for some time to come , changed forever are the calculations that guided the cold-war arms race . " The Gulf crisis represents an ideal paradigm for what our military will have to do in the future , ' says Gen. Edward Meyer , a former Army chief of staff . " It will help us define our strategy and our forces . ' <p> The U.S.-Soviet conventional-arms race , waged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought in the laboratory . The threat of nuclear escalation made the prospect of actually using the latest weapons seem more remote ; with deterrence as the primary goal , paper capabilities mattered almost as much as battlefield performance . <p> But while many of the high-tech jet fighters , ships and missiles the U.S. has developed to combat the Soviets would almost certainly devastate Iraqi forces , some of the electronics-laden equipment that was the product of the cold-war arms race is proving woefully susceptible to the rigors of the field . An Army driver maneuvering his HMMWV jeep through the blazing desert last week kept dousing a rag on top of the radio with bottled water . " It 'll burn up if I do n't , " he explained . The Apache helicopter , which the Army is counting on to kill Iraqi tanks if war breaks out , was plagued in the Panama operation with electronic glitches brought on by the high humidity . In the desert , sand and dust could shut down its turbine engine . " We can barely maintain these systems in peacetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgetown University . " In a hostile environment , systems will go down . ' <p> Many crucial systems have been extensively tested but never fired in anger . These include the helicopter-fired Hellfire antitank missile , the Patriot air defense system and the Tomahawk cruise missile . The Tomahawk is especially important : It could take out Iraqi military targets without causing high civilian casualties . If such weapons systems perform as advertised , U.S. forces would have an enormous edge . But when nine F-111 bombers attacked Muammar Qadhafi 's headquarters in Libya in 1986 , only two managed to drop their laser-guided bombs on the target and neither scored a direct hit . ( When Israeli pilots bombed the Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osirak in 1981 , on the other hand , all 16 of their bombs hit their targets . ) <p> Tank killers . For the same reason , some of the military 's simpler , less glamorous weapons are already finding new favor in the desert . For years , the Air Force has dumped on the A-10 ( affectionately nicknamed " the Warthog ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack jet designed to kill tanks with missiles and a powerful 30-mm cannon . The Air Force had to be forced to buy the A-10s , and has been pushing to replace them with modified , high-performance F-16s . The A-10s are vulnerable to Soviet armored divisions , which travel with their own " integrated air defense " systems , but now they are being touted by the Air Force as the close-air-support weapon of choice against Iraqi tanks . Gen. Michael Dugan , the Air Force chief of staff , says they should be very effective against Iraqi tanks in Kuwait , which are not the newest Soviet models : " It 's the version of tanks that the A-10 was designed against . ' <p> The larger question is whether a force structure designed to contain the Soviets can be adapted to a new world in which the Soviets are likely to be either on the sidelines or on America 's side and in which Third World countries can field sophisticated armies with heavy firepower and armor . In the past , as Senator Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the Pentagon has always assumed that if American weapons " could skin the cat , they could skin the kitty ' - a weapon good enough to beat the Soviets was more than enough to beat anybody else . Some systems designed to counter the Soviets are indeed paying off - in particular , the command , control , communications and intelligence systems that allow American commanders to see the battlefield and control their forces . AWACS radar planes spot virtually all Iraqi air movements and send U.S. planes in to intercept ; spy satellites lofted primarily to keep tabs on the Soviets are eavesdropping on Iraqi communications and constantly updating the picture of the region available to American field commanders . Electronic jamming equipment gives the U.S. an enormous edge ( see page 44 ) . <p> But Operation Desert Shield is also suggesting that dealing with the new threats in the world is even more complex than Pentagon planners have assumed . The most immediate problem is the transportability of the Army 's heavy forces . To counter the Soviet conventional threat , the U.S. has for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army divisions . The 60-ton M1 tank was built to defeat the latest Soviet tanks ; too heavy to be airlifted long distances in a crisis , the M1s were stationed near what used to be the front in Germany . Planners assumed that most other contingencies in the world could be handled by light and special-operations units such as the 82nd Airborne Division , which carries all its supplies with it . <p> But Iraq , with its 5,500 tanks , has revealed some flaws in that reasoning . The Light Armored Vehicles with 25-mm guns that the Army used in Panama are no match for an Iraqi T-72 tank . Wars between Israel and its Arab neighbors , between Egypt and Libya , or between North and South Korea - all of which could involve the U.S. - would likewise be fought with advanced aircraft and modern tanks . In a speech delivered the day Iraqi tanks rolled into Kuwait , President Bush underscored this new military threat : " We are separated from many of our most important allies and interests by thousands of miles of water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may not have the luxury of matching manpower with pre-positioned materiel .... We will need forces that give us a global reach . ' <p> General Dugan says that although the Pentagon had no plan ready to guide the deployment to Saudi Arabia , what he calls " this no-plan plan " nonetheless has moved more materiel in three weeks than was moved in three months at the height of the Korean War . That success in expecting the unexpected is one sign of the military 's ability to adapt to the uncertainties of the post-cold-war world . So , too , is the U.S. troops ' adjustment to the Arabian desert and such rigors as drinking 6 gallons of water a day , thanks to regular exercises at the National Training Center in the Mojave Desert of California . " It 's hot there , it 's dusty there , we 've pretty much been through this already , ' says Lt. Col. Patrick Lamar , operations officer of the 24th Division in Saudi Arabia . <p> But Operation Desert Shield is straining America 's reach to the limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mammoth C-5 transports - 89 planes - and 89 percent of its C-141s - 195 planes . All eight of the Navy 's fast transports were activated to carry the heavy armor of the 24th Infantry Division ( Mechanized ) from Fort Stewart , Ga. , but other heavy equipment will have to travel on slower ships . <p> The lack of adequate airlift and sealift is a direct consequence of the traditional agendas that guided the services throughout the cold war . With a choice of another aircraft carrier or spending $1 billion to purchase and modify unglamorous freighters , the Navy 's preference was unsurprising . " We literally had to go to Congress behind the Navy 's back to get them to buy them , ' says Lawrence Korb , a former assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan administration . <p> Another success story of Desert Shield , the Marines ' " Maritime Pre-positioning Ships , ' was greeted with similar hostility when proposed in the early 1980s . Thirteen such ships are now stationed around the globe , filled with M60 tanks , artillery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nine have been deployed to Saudi Arabia ; the first arrived from the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia in just 4 1/2 days at sea , putting firepower on the ground in the critical first days . Yet the Navy initially had opposed the pre-positioning concept , viewing 13 ships sitting loaded with equipment as an obstacle to attaining its cherished goal of a 600-ship Navy . <p> Old priorities die hard . Congress last year authorized $600 million for more fast sealift , but the Pentagon refused to spend it . Instead , the department wants to transfer the sealift funds to help pay for the final purchase of M1 tanks - in other words , to buy more tanks it has no way to transport quickly . <p> No-frills model . The persistence of cold-war priorities has had other consequences in Saudi Arabia . The older M1 tanks that arrived with the 24th Division lack the ventilation systems that the newer M1A1s have to keep the interior cool and to protect the crew against chemical attack . That means their crews have to wear protective suits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 115 degrees , conditions inside are stifling . " It 's a good 20 degrees hotter inside , and that 's without a chem suit on , ' says Pfc . Vernon Reynolds , an M1 driver . Where are the M1A1s ? " They 're all in Germany . Germany has the first priority , ' explains Capt . Pat Grum of the 24th Division . But Grum says his M1s do have their advantages : " They have the best heaters in the world . ' M1A1s eventually pulled out of Europe may be put on pre-positioning ships so they would be more available for Iraq-type contingencies in the future . <p> But some analysts say Desert Shield argues for more sweeping changes in the design of America 's weapons . Driven by the Soviet threat , the Army continues to press for heavier tanks with bigger guns . But a recent study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that a new class of " middleweight " ground forces may be what is needed to deal with Third World threats . <p> One solution - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest modernization priority ' - is the Armored Gun System . At 17.5 tons apiece , five or six of these tanks could fit on a C-5 transport and be parachute-dropped . With a 105-mm gun , almost as large as the M1A1 's 120-mm , such a tank " could hold the line until we could bring in the bigger tanks by sea , ' says Col. Dennis Long , director of the Army 's armor think tank at Fort Knox . After years of to-ing and fro-ing , the Army has decided to buy 70 AGS 's for airborne units . <p> The Gulf crisis already has shown the value that such armor could have . A month into Operation Desert Shield , says a top military official , the U.S. still does not have enough force on the ground " to do anything offensive against Kuwait . ' Whether or not military action is ever ordered , being able to mount a credible threat on the ground can create enormous diplomatic leverage . <p> Another change that may be in order is a shift toward less complex and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting machine , but its complex electronics and high-performance gas-turbine engine impose enormous logistical requirements . Colonel Lamar of the 24th Division says a battalion of 58 tanks requires 10,000 gallons of fuel a day ; as other experts note , the M1 's engines burn as much as 8 gallons per mile . Lamar says they have 12 fuel trucks running 24 hours a day . Maintaining the M1s also requires complete electronics and hydraulics shops . All told , it takes as many as 10 trucks to support each tank . " The fast-sealift ships could carry more tanks if they did n't have to carry as many support trucks , ' says one Pentagon official . " Our force must have smaller and lighter logistic requirements , ' says General Meyer . <p> More nuts and bolts . All of which points to a major decision that the Pentagon is approaching in its budget and in its entire outlook toward new weapons . With the frantic technological competition with the Soviets easing - and with a comfortable technological lead over the new threats that are emerging - " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system before we know it will work , ' says Senator Nunn . " We now have time to get it right the first time . ' <p> Nunn has recommended that many of the advanced-technology weapons on the services ' wish lists now be placed on a slow track to allow more thorough testing - and the evaluation of cheaper alternatives , such as modernizing existing weapons . The Pentagon budget request , however , still focuses on the continuing Soviet strategic threat : $5.5 billion for the B-2 , $4.5 billion for Star Wars , $2.2 billion for the rail-based MX missile , $3.5 billion for two Seawolf-class attack submarines . The cost of manning the front lines in Europe is dwindling rapidly , but maintaining the technological marvels still needed to keep the cold peace with the Soviet Union , buying the nuts and bolts that can win the hot wars America may face and cashing in a peace dividend , all at the same time , will not be easy . <p> Picture , Early firepower .

The proposed Armored Gun System , like this older Sheridan tank , can be air-dropped . But the heavy M1 can be moved only by ship . In the wake of Panama and Desert Shield , interest in a readily deployable , medium-weight tank has grown ; the AGS carries a 105-mm gun , nearly as large as the M1 's , and can be fitted with extra armor once it hits the ground <p> PICTURE , MI SEITELMAN - FOTO CONSORTIUM <p> Old reliable .

Over Navy opposition , Congress in 1981 ordered the purchase of eight fast-sealift ships that have proved vital in Desert Shield . Making 33 knots , the ships moved 400 tanks in two weeks .

' The CIA 's view <p> CIA Director William Webster discussed Iraq and other issues last week with U.S. News Assistant Managing Editor Brian Duffy . Excerpts : <p> Is Iraq typical of the kinds of new threats the intelligence community faces ? The implications of an unchecked Iraq 's seizing another nation in the Gulf are really enormous . It would leave the Gulf dominated by a country that has the fourth-largest Army in the world , controls 20 percent of the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperation from Saudi Arabia and the other emirate countries , if they are not also taken over by Saddam Hussein . It would pose an additional threat of instability in Iran on the East , and a threat to Israel if Saddam became the Arab knight leading the charge against Israel . <p> How do you assess the threat posed by a man who controls a million-man Army ? What makes Hussein so dangerous ? Of course , accumulation of a massive Army and a willingness to use it . But other aspects aggravate the situation and raise issues not present 20 or even 10 years ago . Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the Third World will be one of our major challenges in the future . It has already happened . We gathered up so many weapons and weapons became so readily available that artillery and rockets and so on became stockpiled all over the world . And those gradually found their way into Third World countries . <p> But as this was happening , we were also seeing that weapons such as chemical weapons and biological weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development and production . We saw it with the Rabta plant in Libya . Now , Saddam Hussein still possesses those weapons . He has been moving to increase his capability . And with the chemical weapons themselves , he has been concentrating on longer-range delivery systems . So , we get the combination of proliferation of weapons and proliferation of missiles . The long cannon that he called a throwing pipe is just one way to deliver weapons of mass destruction at a distance . Iraq 's SCUD missiles have that capability as well . Although they 're not terribly accurate , they do n't need to be . Now , with his modification of the SCUD 's , he can reach most of the major cities in his area . So suddenly this sleepy , Third World area becomes significant to the United States and its allies . <p> Have the Soviets been at all helpful ? I think we are getting as much cooperation from the Soviets as we might have any reason to expect , once you put yourself in the other fellow 's shoes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-cold-war threat , CHARLIE ARCHAMBAULT FOR USN &WR; <p> By Brian Duffy <p>
