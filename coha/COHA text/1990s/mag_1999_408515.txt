Do the least to get the - most Photograph Photograph // Fast-forward to New Year 's Day : Everyone you know is groaning about the weight they gained over the holidays , wishing they 'd lifted a dumbbell or two instead of every glass of eggnog in sight . Now they 're back at the gym - gasping for breath on the treadmill , struggling to touch their toes and not exactly setting any records on the leg press . And you ? Well , you 're feeling fit , firm and flexible , ready to kick off the millennium by building even more strength and stamina than you already have . Yes , 1999 is the year you defy tradition and stay in shape during the holidays . " Most people have an all-ornothing attitude toward the gym , especially during November and December , " says Wayne Westcott , Ph.D. , director of fitness research at the South Shore YMCA in Quincy , Mass . " If they do n't have time for their regular workout , they skip the whole thing . But the truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month to six weeks and not lose all of the benefits you 've reaped throughout the year . " To help you stay fit from Thanksgiving through New Year 's , Westcott has designed a half-hour , three-times-a-week program that combines cardiovascular exercise , strength training and stretching . Now , we wo n't kid you : This program wo n't transform you into Buffy the Vampire Slayer or prepare you to run a marathon ; the idea is simply to finish the holiday season in the same shape in which you started . " You wo n't have fallen behind , " Westcott says , " so that automatically puts you ahead of everyone else . " 1 Start with 15 minutes on any cardio machine such as Set treadmill , elliptical trainer , bike or stair climber . Set the program at a moderate intensity ( you should feel as if you 're working hard , but can still carry on a conversation ) . Maintain this pace for the entire 15 minutes . 2 Next , you 'll do are total-body strength-training routine . The four " Must-do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " are a recommended supplement . For each exercise , do 1-2 sets of 10-12 repetitions to failure ( rest a minute between sets ) . See the Q &A; for more details . 3 Instead of strength around chitchatting between strength-training exercises , stretch without muscle groups you just worked . Hold each stretch to a point of mild tension for 30 seconds without bouncing . 1 . leg press Adjust the backrest of a leg press machine to 45 degrees , so when you sit on the machine your pelvis and shoulders rest firmly against it , feet hip-width apart and parallel to each other in center of foot plate . Ankle , knee and hip joints should align . Hold handles for support , release machine lock and straighten legs without locking knees A. Bend knees toward your chest until knees are at a 90-degree angle to hips B. Straighten legs , keeping feet flat on plate , pressing through heels until legs are straight but knees are not locked ; repeat . Strengthens quadriceps , hamstrings , buttocks and calves . Recommended weight range : 100-150 pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 degrees ; sit with your knees bent and feet flat on floor . Contract abdominals so your entire back touches the bench . Hold a dumbbell in each hand with arms extended above chin level , arms straight but not locked , palms facing forward A. Bend elbows out to the sides until elbows are just below shoulders B. Press dumbbells up to starting position ; repeat . Do n't let weights touch . Strengthens chest , front shoulder and triceps . Recommended weight range : 8-20 pounds per hand . 3. lat pulldown Sit on seat of lat pulldown machine , knees bent , feet flat on floo Adjust knee pad to comfortably secure thighs . Contract abdominals and lean upper body back slightly from your hips . Grasp lat bar at a width moderately wider then shoulders , palms forward , shoulder blades pulled down and chest lifted A. Pull elbows down and in towards sides , keeping lower arms vertical B. Slowly straighten arms to starting position ; repeat . Recommended weight range : 30-60 pounds . 4. ab bench crunch Lie down on an ab bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hips and knees are at 90 degrees . Grasp handles and keep head and neck in a neutral position A. Contract abs , bringing ribs in toward pelvis and using handles and headrest only for support B. Keep abs contracted as you slowly lower to original position . Recommended weight range : 30-60 pounds . Does our holiday workout sound too Photograph // good to be true ? Here are the answers to questions you may have about the program , along with tips for expanding the routine if you find yourself with extra time . workout Q &A; Can you really fit cardio exercise , strength training and stretching into 30 minutes ? a Yes , but remember : These are 30 jampacked , no-nonsense minutes . Many of us spend more time standing around ( resting , talking , people watching , waiting for equipment ) than we actually spend exercising . This program does n't allow time for that . Waiting for equipment should n't be a problem : The holiday season is one of the most deserted times of the year for health clubs . Photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Sorry , not quite ! While 15 minutes of cardio can get you through the holidays unscathed , it 's not enough for a permanent program . TO be fit , The American College of Sports Medicine recommends 20-60 minutes of continuous or intermittent cardio activity performed at 65-90 percent of your maximum heart rate , three to five times per week . If you want to lose weight , you need to do more frequent and longer bouts of cardio exercise , but you can stick to the low-to mid-intensity range of the recommendation . As for strength training , the answer depends on your goals . If you just want to build enough strength for good health , one set of eight exercises may be enough . If you want to tone and shape your body , you need to go beyond these eight basics and to do more than one set . A trainer can help you create a program to meet specific goals . Can one set of weight-training exercises really do the trick ? Absolutely . In studies of more than 1,100 untrained subjects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased lean body mass ( presumably muscle ) by an average of 2.5 pounds in just eight weeks . " No studies of multiple sets show greater strength gains for beginners or novice weight trainers , " he says . To get results , you ca n't just hoist any old weight up and down 10 times . You need to lift a fairly heavy amount and perform your repetitions slowly , with control . " Most people at the gym move very quickly - they take about 15 seconds to do 10 reps , " says Westcott . " They rely on momentum , rather than muscle power , to perform the exercise . " Instead , slow down ! Take a full 6 seconds for each repetition - 4 seconds to lift the weight , 2 seconds to lower it . And make sure that your weights are heavy enough . You should have true difficulty finishing the last repetition . That 's fatigue . And by the way , lifting heavy weights wo n't make you bulk up . The vast majority of women do n't have enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight trainers wo n't gain any more strength with one-set training . However , if they are too pressed for time to do their usual routine this program should help them keep their fitness level high enough to resume training after the holidays . Are there other strength-training techniques I can use to save time ? Try " breakdown " training : Perform 10 reps to fatigue , then immediately reduce the weight ( 20 percent for lower-body exercises and 10 percent for upper-body moves ) , and squeeze out three or four more reps . Over eight weeks , Westcott 's research suggests , breakdown training can boost your strength by nearly 40 percent compared to traditional one-set training . " You have to dig deeper since the muscle fibers are already fatigued , " Westcott explains . Besides saving time , what 's the benefit of stretching between strength-training exercises ?  --  a Besides increasing flexibility , stretching may actually help you get stronger . Research done by Westcott shows that people who stretched their hamstrings right after strengthening them gained 19 percent more strength over 10 weeks than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical properties of a muscle in a way that may somehow enhance the training stimulus , " Westcott says . If I have more than 30 minutes to work out , should I spend the time on strength training or cardio exercise ? a Go for cardio ; it 's the most efficient calorie burner . Try interval training , alternating low-intensity work with short bursts at a faster pace . For instance , after 15 minutes at a slow to moderate pace , alternate 1 minute at a faster pace with 1-2 minutes at the moderate pace , for as long as you like . Cool down with 5 minutes at a slow pace . Or , even better , do something active snowshoeing , skiing and ice skating are all great ways to stay in shape . And if you ca n't go outside , turn on the CID player and dance to your favorite tunes . Have fun !
