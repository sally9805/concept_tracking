Section : FRIDAY <p> As dawn slid over Skull Mountain I arrived at camp , ten hours hard driving from home . Itwas too dark and too late to pitch a tent , so I bundled my sleeping bag around me and curled up on the car seat An hour later , groggy and aching , I gave up on sleep and ventured out with my tin cup in hope of coffee . Someone who 'd seen my little brother up at the gate d the camp sent me his way . <p> In the morning light everything looked familiar again : the hard , pale ground paved with rocks , the roads kicked into dust , the scattered tufts of thorn and creosote bushes  --  the terrain of the Great Basin , the plateau between the Sierra Nevada and the Rockies that does n't drain into either side of the Continental Divide . For one thing , there 's practically nothing to drain . Range after range of mountains , each separated from the next by a flat expanse like the one the camp was on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Utah . Over the Funeral Mountains to the west is Death Valley and the beginning of California . <p> The particular basin we were camped in is sliced in half by Highway 95 ; on the other side of the road from us was the Nevada Test Site , where the U.S. government explodes prototypes of all its nuclear bombs . On our side hundreds of cars were scattered around the land ; distant figures toted water , made breakfast , and lined up to use the chemical toilets . This was the Peace Camp , where thousands gather every spring , getting ready to invade the test site . <p> I remembered to be afraid of the dust , the dust that might be radioactive , the dust that over the next few days would powder everything to biscuit color . Actually , most studies suggested that the radiation levels around the test site were about the same as those in Las Vegas , 70 miles south  --  though that was n't necessarily comforting , especially if you lived in Las Vegas . <p> The Nevada Test Site is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are big . Nellis Air Force Base , which incorporates the test site , covers 3.1 million acres , bigger than some New England states , bigger than nearly any national park . Out here it 's standard practice to drive hundreds of miles for minor reasons , and a hundred miles along the empty highways across basin and range have little in common with the same distance through a lusher landscape . For mile after mile nothing seems to change at all ; then the mesa on the horizon looms up and goes by and a new mesa appears . There 's a ghastly majesty about the bigness and the slowness of the landscape , with its bare , forbidding geology . The U.S. government chose the arid West for the bulk of its bombing projects because there are so few people around to object  --  the state of Nevada has about three-quarters of a million citizens , half of them in Las Vegas  --  and because this landscape is supposed to be worthless already . <p> Half a mile down the road to 95 , I found my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and joined them . They were on their way down the highway to blockade the workers coming from Las Vegas to Mercury , the town inside the test site . They were merry , burbling inconsequentialities , joking , drinking out of water bottles , botas , and canteens , clad in jeans , flannel shirts , T-shirts championing other events and causes , shorts , army surplus gear , bandannas , shawls , ethnic oddments , tights , and thermals . Early in the morning , the test site is still cold . <p> We passed the main gate to the test site , also the way to Mercury , and kept going . Built in the 1950s , Mercury has been partially evacuated , the first nuclear ghost town in a state full of mining ghost towns . Women and children are forbidden to live there because of the radiation risks , and most of the Mercury workers live in Las Vegas . By day the town is a faint glimmer of dustcolored buildings a few miles into the site , but by night it looks like a quilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the camp . <p> The theory of civil disobedience is a noble one , first articulated by Henry David Thoreau ; the practice of civil disobedience is more variable . Many religious people , notably Catholics and Quakers , commit civil disobedience with quiet fervor ; a lot of anarchists and others young and radical bring to it an insurrectionary spirit that suggests nonviolence is less an ideal than a strategy . Civil disobedience is a strange thing , since you ca n't commit it without the collusion of the government , and the whole exercise often comes to resemble some vast choreographed game . We put our bodies where they are n't supposed to be , which to us signifies commitment to our ideals and opposition to unjust governance  --  but to the authorities it signifies our lawlessness . And so , when they arrest us , we all , sheriffs and Thoreauvians , find our convictions strengthened . And when the cases are tried , defenses of necessity and Nuremberg principles are never allowed to be introduced in court , so we 're tried as common misdemeanor criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , unlike all the supplicatory lobbying and petitioning that somehow endorse the imbalance of power they seek to redress . <p> My brother has been arrested dozens , maybe even hundreds of times . He is an anarchist and an organizer , and though I think he was originally an anarchist in the casual sense that innumerable punks were in the 1980s , he has since read his Bakunin and Kropotkin and is now very serious about his beliefs . Not anarchy as in chaos , I should add , but as in the absence of hierarchies : Anarchism is a venerable political philosophy predicated on direct democracy  --  which works out in practice to mean interminable meetings to achieve consensus on all decisions , a virtuous and necessary tedium . Somewhere along the line , my brother reinvented himself as a regular guy with an air of easygoing camaraderie  --  he never became humorless about his ideals , and the ridiculous is something we both rejoice in . At some point in his early 20s he also stopped being as pale as I am , though we are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows one of us immediately recognizes the other . If it were n't for my brother , I probably would n't have come to Nevada . He makes it possible for me to keep up on the anarchist-activist scene without actually being a part of it . <p> The arrests , which began at seven in the morning , were rowdy . Activists had been expected to wander into the test site , but not into oncoming traffic , so the sheriffs , thick and redfaced , in tight , shortsleeved uniforms the same color as the dust , were irate . Workerladen luxury cruiser buses , pickups , Winnebagos , and Jeep Cherokees began to pile up as sheriffs and activists thwarted each other on the northbound side of the divided , four-lane highway . Because this was a surprise action , there was no place to take the blockaders until some empty buses came , so they were handcuffed and set down by the side of the road . The crowd on the highway thinned and the crowd on the shoulder thickened ; then everyone rushed back onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other , and many refused to move , so they had to be picked up or dragged . Traffic backed up for half a mile . As I watched the burly men picking up skinny young blockaders by legs and arms stiff with resistance , I began to see what frail material bodies are to put between the landscape and the military . Watching the sheriffs carrying away all these people and putting them on buses , my eyes filled with tears . After the buses pulled away I went back to camp and pitched my tent beside three yuccas and crawled in and went to sleep . <p> This was my third spring at the camp . The actions had begun in earnest in 1985 , when religious activists decided that it was time to turn to one of the very sources of the arms race , the Nevada Test Site , where nearly every type of U.S. nuclear bomb has been tested since the dawn of the atomic age . They began holding an annual Lenten vigil there , and the spring actions grew and grew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could bear to camp out in the high desert , because of the ferocious heat of summer and cold of winter . Even in spring the nights can be freezing , and the daytime temperatures climb into the 90s . ) This year attendance was down a little , probably because so many Americans took the peaceful changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe as a sign that everything would turn out all right without their participation . The Cold War , popular wisdom had it , was thawing nicely . <p> In past years a few people had actually walked to ground zero and stopped nuclear tests . Getting there meant carrying 70-pound packs weighed down with gallons of water , walking by night and sleeping in gullies by day , for three or more days . In 1986 a team showed up at ground zero and disrupted a planned test , and in 1988 a woman walked to an observation tower at ground zero and locked herself to a steel pole . <p> The guidelines for such actions were terrifying in themselves : " The Nevada Test Site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumps , and storage areas .... Little can be done to protect your body from beta and gamma rays , which are unseen and penetrate your body . Alpha particles , however , are found on dust particles that can be breathed in or ingested . Cover your face when walking in the wind . Do not eat food dropped on the ground .... A large test can throw someone three meters into the air at ground zero and kill them . There is a rippling of ground motion that goes out from this center . Detonations create limited earthquakes . The Nellis Air Force Base surrounds the test site on the east , west , and north . Depending on which part you venture through , you will have to deal with ammunition strafing , falling bombs , and unexploded bombs on the ground .... " <p> You might expect that the place where all our nuclear weapons are tested would be a major national security area , but the government has always counted on remoteness and indifference to shield its actions . It was interesting to realize that national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of people . The first year I walked in with friends , into the arms of the waiting guards . The second year I went in with a bunch of anarchist women , after agreeing that we 'd pair off so that no one got abandoned or left at the guards ' mercy without a witness . We went in about a mile north of the main gate so we 'd have time to hike a ways before we were discovered . <p> We only got about a quarter mile into the site that spring afternoon in 1989 before we were spotted by helicopters swooping low overhead , men in paramilitary costume leaning out ready to jump . For Americans my age the sound of helicopters is a strange one , nostalgic and exotic , reminiscent of the war that ran on TV all through our grade-school years , not a sound I associate with the desert . But when the hovering copter got low enough to pelt us with gravel stirred up by its rotor blades , we ran , and the men leapt out and ran after us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert , with its soft patches of sand , cobbled stretches , boulders. and loose-rocks. only slowing down enough to keep pace with the woman I 'd paired off with . The anarchists were all wearing red and purple and black , and I in my dusty khaki regretted that we were so visible and wondered how well I 'd do alone . I ran for a ways without looking back , and then fumed my head a little and saw a man in camouflage all but close enough to grab me , far closer than I had expected . <p> I gave up easily , letting them handcuff my hands behind my back , but my companion resisted , telling the two guards why she was there and by what right , citing the fact that the land was stolen from the Shoshone , that she was obeying Nuremberg principles . Now I ca n't even remember who she was , only the conviction with which she refused to cooperate . Because she would n't walk , they herded us into another gully and handcuffed us ankle to ankle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforcements . There was nothing to say . <p> The second guard resumed with a third man , and while one walked behind me the other two picked my partner up by her arms and legs , one on each side , and carried her . We had progressed a couple hundred yards in this manner when an older guard joined our group , snarling at his colleagues not to indulge my companion . He got them to drag her , and then told them to stop taking her around the obstacles , and they began to pull her through thorns and cactus . Near tears , she finally gave up and asked them to stop , and we walked to the waiting van , where we rejoined some of the other women in our group . She took off her hiking boot and took out her Swiss Army knife , and I tried to pull out as many thorns as I could with its tweezers . Some of them were huge , and one long one broke off deep in her foot . <p> I have difficulty connecting the abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil disobedience in the cause of peace and survival ; in the concrete we were scrabbling around in the scrub , playing tag with a bunch of rented guards who thought we were completely demented . I always had trouble seeing the guards as representatives of U. S. military policy rather than as rednecks with limited career options . <p> The invisible background to all this , to our plastic handcuffs , to the thorn that broke off in my companion 's foot , to the whole ramshackle Peace Camp and its banners and its ripples into the larger world , the background we would never see , was the subterranean explosion of huge nuclear weapons in preparation for war . <p> In the early 1950s , when nuclear-weapons tests were still above ground , no precautions were taken at all ; soldiers were sent to witness the tests so the army could study their reactions , and locals were never warned . The predawn explosions had been visible hundreds of miles away . Now there was nothing to see : All tests had been underground since the uproar over strontium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radioactive clouds did n't disappear when testing moved underground . When the bombs explode in their shafts deep in the ground , they create huge caverns filled with hot , pressurized radioactive gases . As the gases cool , the earth above caves in , and in at least 42 cases gases have escaped into the atmosphere and been registered off-site . <p> The antinuclear movement has changed in recent years , broadening its focus from the potential dangers of nuclear war to the constant dangers of the weapons ' very existence : the tests , the byproducts , the economic burden they impose , the insoluble problems of radioactive-waste disposal . And once I got to Nevada , I realized that war was n't something the government was merely preparing for here ; war was being waged against the landscape and the locals . The state of Nevada was a state of war . It was hard to remember all this when pulling thorns out of someone 's sweaty foot with my hands cuffed together in the back seat of a security van . <p> The land of the Nevada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Energy , which oversees the site , has an agreement whereby Nye County authorities have responsibility for security . Nye County has a population in the low thousands , however , and though it gets paid to arrest us , it does n't get paid to prosecute us . So county officers round us up and haul us away and toss us out ; we serve as a kind of seasonal income . Some people say that the county is trying to irritate the DOE into patrolling its own premises by letting us off so lightly . <p> The land should n't really fall under the jurisdiction of either of these parties , however , because Abraham Lincoln ceded it in perpetuity to the Western Shoshone Nation in the 1863 Treaty of Ruby Valley . The Nevada Test Site is stolen Indian territory  --  or , rather , part of a stolen sovereign nation of some 43,000 square miles . The Shoshone have been trying to get their land , which they call Newe Segobia , back for decades , without much success . The government tacitly recognizes their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $26,145,189.89 in the bank as payment for it . But the Western Shoshone do n't want this ludicrously small amount ; they want their ancestral land returned . The Shoshone give activists permits to be on their land , and one of the pleasant things that can be said to one 's arresting officer is that he is , in fact , the one who is there illegally . <p> There 's something profoundly , quintessentially American about getting arrested at the Nevada Test Site : the very issues are not cowboys and Indians , but land , war technology , Thoreauvian civil disobedience tactics , bureaucratic obfuscation , and Native American land rights . To start the day in the cold of a desert morning , sitting on rocks and drinking coffee , to fill your water bottle and mill around with friends and acquaintances as the day gradually creeps toward hotness , to sit through a sometimes stirring , mostly dull rally of speeches and music ( folk to punk and back again ) , to commit the fairly abstract act of climbing under a wire fence that separates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocky expanse of thorn bushes and cactus , to be confronted by hired help in the wrong kind of camouflage , to go through numerous pairs of disposable plastic handcuffs as the sheriffs rearrange their captives , to idle in a sort of cattle pen built just for us , to be escorted after many hours in the sun into a special luxury bus and be given a ride down scenic Highway 95 , to be interrogated by hardfaced sheriffettes with piles of teased hair who are irritated by anyone who wants to give a more complicated name than Jane Doe or Shoshone Guest , to be tossed out into a small town , to catch up on the wellbeing of friends and head for fast food and ice cream in the middle of the night , to plunk quarters into slot machines while waiting for the food to come , winning the occasional handful of change , to burn up thousands more gallons of gas getting driven back to the camp , to wind through the rocks and thorns in the dark to a sleeping bag on hard , uneven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyplace else in the world  --  could anything be more redolent of life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ? <p> And in 1990 I got cowboys . Friday afternoon the arrestees from the roadblock started trickling back to the Peace Camp . I ran into Bob Fulkerson from Citizen Alert , a group " working for public participation and governmental accountability in issues of concern to Nevadans . " Bob , a fifth generation Nevadan of the kind that gets called rangy , told me stories about the military and the state all afternnon , and then invited me to come on a caravan tour of Nevada leaving on Sunday . In his cheerful , laconic way he filled me in on the DOE ( Department of Energy ) , MOAs ( military operation areas ) , FONSls ( findings of no significant impact ) , Secret Area 51 , the bombing of Native American reservations , and the people driven out of Dixie Valley by incessant sonic booms from Navy planes . As we talked , a dust devil ripped through the camp , picked up hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spun them 50 feet into the air , then lifted high a huge black tarp and carried it , flapping loudly and looking like a pterodactyl , over the camp . <p> Late in the afternoon , with my head whirling from acronyms and horror stories , I set out due west for the mesas that overhung the camp site . After about ten minutes I ran into Richard Misrach walking an equally straight line south . He was carrying a camera that would unbalance nearly anyone else : a huge mahogany box on a tripod as tall as he is . A view camera that makes 8 x 10 negatives , it is his equipment of choice . His pictures are usually of luminous expanses in which something is going wrong , images in which the beauty of the landscape is overlaid but never obliterated by environmental damage . I was supposed to be writing about these controversial photographs for a New York art magazine , and we 'd been talking about landscape ideology back at home . We began again here , and the fruit of my research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was defined as wilderness , and this definition made its development possible : Wilderness meant willfulness , intimated a need for taming , described the land as empty and waiting to be filled , denied that anyone was already at home in it . This myth asserted that the land was without a past , pure , and waiting to be given a future , that it was a resource to be given meaning by man . The history of the West was the history of breaking the will of the land . Even Thoreau 's pal Emerson wrote to John Muir that the wilderness was a sublime mistress but an intolerable wife . The myth of wilderness was established in the art and literature of the 19th century and imposed on the land itself . I made Richard listen to me go on about the relationship between romantic aesthetics and the mauling of the West . Finally he told me that he had to go because the light was perfect ; he continued south and I continued west . <p> Space is different in the desert . The harshness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and its supports in the vast expanses . In the temperate world , we live at middle distance . Hills and buildings diminish the sky , houses and cities are big and valleys are small , the space between things is not so intimidating . Only the Shoshone , Paiute , and Washo have ever loved the land out here  --  and maybe some of the ranchers whose cattle overgraze it . Mark Twain said that Nevada could make the devil homesick , and he never came back . Vacationers go to other states to see deserts and mountains , to Utah , Arizona , Colorado . Pioneers who did n't make it to California usually gave up in the Great Basin , and its frontier history is filled with summertime disaster stories about lack of water as awful as the Donner party 's wintry starvation a ways north of here . The early history of Nevada is one of men burrowing beneath the ground , in the great Comstock Lode and all the other silver and gold deposits that left the landscape littered with ghost towns . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jets , and missiles crisscrossing the sky . So much of Nevada is restricted military airspace that commercial flights have to take a lengthy zigzag across the state , and more is being put off-limits all the time . Nuclear weapons have followed a different course : In the 1950s test explosions rose higher and higher into the air above Frenchman Flats , and ever since 1963 they have been biting into the earth , in pits as much as a mile deep . Saturday <p> On the morning of March 31 , 1990 , the People 's Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was signed by representatives from Japan , both Germanies , and the Netherlands , by American Peace Test organizer Jackie Cabasso , Kairot Umarov of the Soviet Union 's NevadaSemipalatinsk Antinuclear Movement , and Raymond Yowell , Chief of the Western Shoshone National Council . The signing , on an impromptu stage , was the prelude to the event of the day , the mass arrests . This year , the Shoshone participants would lead a procession to the cattleguard at the main gate , then cross it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join in their land-rights claim as well as in the antitesting stuff could follow them . I decided to follow . <p> I walked along the barbed-wire fence that delineates the boundary of the test site , while guards in camouflaged dune buggies watched from the other side . On the fence itself signs warned against trespass , and other signs declared the land a habitat-preservation area for the endangered desert tortoise . The sun felt menacing , and there was no shade . There used to be pinon pines in this part of the Great Basin , and their nuts were a staple of the Shoshone diet , but the government tore out all the trees in the name of range improvement . Trees , turtles- nothing in this place escaped being an issue . The air was thin and clear , and the sun poured down . <p> A mere trench dug in the road with steel bars running across it , safe enough for tires and human feet but too treacherous for hooves , the cattleguard across the main gate of the Nevada Test Site is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though nothing stops people from gathering on either side of the road that leads across the cattleguard to Mercury . There we congregated and milled . I ran into Richard again . After a drink from my bota , we picked up our discussion where we had left off yesterday . As the Shoshone were walking across the cattleguard a few yards away I found myself saying , " But Richard , you have to finish telling me about the new myth of the American West . " He said , " You know , you really need to cross that line pretty soon if you 're going to get arrested . " <p> I offered no resistance as the guards tightened the disposable plastic handcuffs and snipped off the ends , which dropped into the dust . ( The test site must be littered with thousands of handcuffs and ends by now . ) The plastic cuffs lack the ominous resonance of metal handcuffs , looking less like appurtenances of crime and punishment than like industrial fasteners ; they make it clear that we 're just being packaged for efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through a notched slot that prevents them from going the other way , so the cuffs can get tighter but not looser  --  unless you happen to have a safety pin to pry open the notch with , as I did . Inside the dusty pen I liberated a couple dozen women from their handcuffs and squatted in the shrinking shade of the wall that divided us from the men . Not much else happened . I thought about what Richard had told me : That he has no theory of the American West , only that the old one no longer works . <p> Coherence is a great lure , and making sense out of things is what artists are supposed to do . Landscape has always been defined by urban dwellers as a refuge , a place where nothing happens . European landscapes , with their ruins , usually came after history ; American landscapes , with their inviting expanses and sexy metaphors , were usually waiting for history , like the Sabine women waiting for the Romans . Pristine landscapes were art and could be lush and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small and ugly . In American landscape art , there was no tradition for representing landscape between the before and after , for recognizing landscape as a field of action : After nature came disaster , after the sublime came real estate . <p> Richard 's pictures violate this grammar of landscape to depict something that no one else has . They show that our recent history has been incoherent ; its crimes do n't correspond to our categories . Looking out the window of the bus that carried us to the town of Beatty , with re-cuffed hands in lap , I could see that Nevada was still beautiful even though it was overgrazed , bombed , irradiated , and stolen , that the land was saturated with tranquil late-aftenoon light even though it was a battlefield . Sunday <p> Sunday morning I looked all over camp for the locals from Citizen Alert who were going to take me out to see a bomb crater , and I could n't find them anywhere . Giant puppets , made to be carried by four people apiece , were being assembled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be an April Fools ' Parade to the gates , the inevitable gates . Richard , my brother , and a cluster of others were painting their faces white and costuming themselves as Death . Finally I saw Bill Rosse , one of the Shoshone elders , short and barrelchested with a big , silver belt buckle and a handlebar mustache . When I asked him if he knew where the Nevadans were , he looked intently at me for a minute and suddenly gave me a bear hug . He had known who I was immediately , although he 'd never seen me before . He thought my brother and I were twins ; I explained my slight seniority . I teased him back about knowing who he was : There was a picture of him in the information tent , with a scrawled note that he 'd had five bypasses and was recovering nicely . I told him that he must have an unusually large heart , since most people had only four valves . He told me he was coming along on the trip himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . <p> On Highway 95 to Beatty again , I found out what I had been seeing on all those earlier trips . Chris , who is the entire southern staff of Reno-based Citizen Alert , kept up a running commentary on geology , history , botany , and local politics . <p> We passed Yucca Mountain , a dark ridge a few miles east of the road . Clouds hung over it , making it look even darker , and its barren sides had eroded into gaunt ribs . Yucca Mountain is where the DOE intends to bury all the nation 's high-level radioactive waste . This plan has become a major source of controversy between Nevada and the federal government since the state strongly opposes using the mountain as a nuclear dump . The feasibility studies themselves have come under attack from the state , from Chris ' group , and from antinuclear groups across the country , but the DOE is anxious to do something with the 50,000 tons of high-level radioactive waste that have accumulated over the decades of our nuclear history . Yucca Mountain has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locale for a radioactive waste dump , and Chris added that the ridge is the result of a volcano that is n't very old , in geologic terms . And something more fantastic : The mountain breathes . One day a geologist saw a piece of paper left over a core-sample tunnel float upwards , and further investigations uncovered a gentle current of air coming out of the mountain , or sometimes going into it . Nothing much was done about this discovery , though a breathing mountain full of radiation is an uncomfortable idea . <p> Beatty is " Gateway to Death Valley " ; Tonopah calls itself " Home of the Stealth . " We stopped at the supermarket there , where I found a display of Stealth Bomber coffee cups and baseball caps . It was exciting to see sweet rolls in cellophane wrap and cold vegetables and bottles of wine , almost as exciting as it had been to stick my face under running water during a pitstop in Beatty . Bob and his friend Kit Miller bought a colossal pot roast , beer , bacon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob , Bill Rosse , and a few others on the trip had that quality I think of as Western : a good-natured , jokey , unflappable demeanor rooted in competence in the physical world , in knowing what to do with trucks , campfires , sheriffs , and dogs  --  and seemingly not worrying much about the rest of it . ) <p> At Tonopah we left Highway 95 and turned east . The road passed bomb bunkers , earthen mounds designed to minimize the impact of accidental explosions . Chris told bomb-storage stories about the incredible quantities of decaying explosives cached around the state . The range we passed through was bigger and lonelier than any I 'd , seen before . We were about two hundred miles northeast of the Peace Camp and we were still circumnavigating the test site . <p> Seven mustangs loped across the road , five chestnuts , a bay , and a black . Three days into Nevada and halfway across the state , I was beginning to forget where I 'd come from and what I did there . The stories about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the spectacle of exuberant wild horses seemed of a piece with this expedition with cowboys and Indians , something I 'd read about but never quite believed in . I am used to being on the coast , where foreign countries and world affairs rub against you every day ; here the isolated basins and ranges seemed to swallow everything up . It was hard to imagine the places where the Stealth Bomber might be used , hard to remember that there was anyplace else at all . The strange , pointless war being waged against the landscape seemed unrelated to international politics , as though testing weapons were an end in itself , or as though Nevada were the enemy . <p> It did n't matter here that the Cold War might be ending . The generals said that withdrawing from Europe just meant that they needed more land for tests and training at home . It did n't matter that the arms race had halted when so many tons of radioactive waste were already waiting to be dumped . The fight against testing had started out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ; the arms race had come to be seen as a clear and present danger rather than potential devastation . The Shoshone had joined in as environmentalists concerned about the well-being of their land and their jurisdiction over it . After all , all they had ever conceded to anyone else was right of passage . <p> Our destination was Moore 's Station , a revamped pony express stop in a cluster of dying trees about fifteen miles down a dirt road in central Nevada . Built into a bluff , the station consists of half a dozen stone outbuildings and a handsome two-story house with window frames open to the elements . The orchard of apple trees was dry and nearly leafless , and the tall poplars were brittle-looking , though a stream ran through the pasture . There were real mountains in the distance . Moore 's Station seemed like a place where nothing had ever happened and nothing ever would . For me there was nothing to do but wander slightly dazed from the day of driving . Bob and Kit and a few of the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , and by the time the roast was ready to come out of its clutch oven the sun had set and the heat from the fire was welcome . <p> The rest of the caravan arrived in the darkness . Bill took out his guitar and sang late into the night , after explaining that it was n't that he hated women but that he loved country music . His lyrics were all rancorous or melancholy reassessments of ruined relationships , except for the cowboy songs about grievous bodily harm from gorings and stampedes , and he beamed through them all . Beers came out , a bottle of wine went from hand to hand . The wind rotated the heavy campfire smoke around the circle as reliably as a clock hand , but stepping back from the circle of light meant entering bitter cold , and we all basted in the heat . Monday <p> Monday morning I was filthy , freezing , stinking of smoke . Birds sang , which they never did at the test site . We got the fire going again , and I huddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been so cold the eggs had frozen , and we had to leave before they could be scrambled . We went to see the petroglyphs and the bomb crater , which were very near each other , a juxtaposition too portentous to comment on . The petroglyphs were unusual and beautiful : whole sheets of rusty pattern on the pale sides of a white gulch , strange figures and lines and jagged bolts and circles . Petroglyphs always make lost cultures seem more distant ; they are evidence of a complexity of thought that is now irrecoverable . I ca n't imagine the people who inscribed them , the way of life in which art was stored unobtrusively through out the landscape , the way they might have been read . <p> The crater made by an atomic test in 1968 had its own strangeness . There was a shallow basin about thirty yards across where the earth had dropped , and the bushes growing in it were paler than the bushes anywhere else . It was completely quiet ; the road , the crater , and the petroglyphs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the 3,000 foot shaft the bomb had been dropped down , a ten-foot-wide cylinder .
