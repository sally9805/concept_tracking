<p> The Republican revolution is alive and well in Texas . <p> Cut spending . Lower taxes . Make government more accountable . <p> This is my money , Texans are telling Washington . Until you spend less of it more wisely , goes the call , hands off . <p> Sound like a rallying cry for House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his Republican ranks who are playing hardball with the Clinton administration over the budget ? Sound like a warning to Clinton ? It 's probably both . <p> Though Texans appear less likely than the GOP congressional forces to want to shut down the government in the interest of a balanced budget , a Houston Chronicle/Dallas Morning News poll shows that many Texas voters are calling this portion of the Gingrich agenda their own . <p> " " Whatever the Republicans want to cut , I 'm for it , " said Ruth Davidson Smith , 89 , from Hughes Springs in Northeast Texas . <p> She sees the government as a sort of gigantic charity . " " I do n't care how far they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is all right by me . " <p> More than one out of four Texans think government spending and taxes should be given the highest priority among the issues facing the nation . Their chief concern : a soaring budget deficit that , if left unchecked , could mean massive taxes for future generations . <p> No other single issue ranked as high as government spending and taxes . And though the deficit is a major concern , the poll 's overriding message seems to be that the federal government - especially under Clinton - does more harm than good . <p> Nearly every other person polled identified either government spending and taxes or making government more accountable as their top concerns . <p> " " Much of the country is fearful the Republicans will go too far , " said pollster Micheline Blum of Blum &; Weprin Associates Inc . " " I 'm not sure we saw much of that in Texas . " <p> Texans appear to be motivated as much by ideology as self-interest . Nearly two-thirds of Texas voters say they are satisfied with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better off than they are . <p> Still , most Texas voters do not appear to want Republican victory at all costs . Of those who place government accountability among their top two priorities , one-third said they want Clinton and Congress to care more about reaching a consensus than political advantage . <p> " " Texas voters want the Republican agenda , " said Blum . " " But not <p> to the point that nothing gets done . " <p> The poll comes less than a month before Republicans begin the process of choosing a challenger for Clinton and about nine months before the 1996 presidential election . It finds Texans seemingly out of step with the rest of the nation , which in a USA TODAY/CNN Gallup Poll last week identified education , crime and the economy as the major issues . <p> According to the survey of Texas voters , the issues that swept the GOP to power two years ago have galvanized Texas Republicans . Nearly half of them identified government spending and taxes as their top priorities . Democrats , on the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the firm 's findings suggest not only that the Republican message is resonating in the Lone Star State , but that traditionally Democratic Texas is becoming increasingly Republican - regardless of Democratic achievements . <p> " " With each year and each election cycle , Texas is moving more and more to the right , " Blum said . <p> Like its repudiation of Democratic Gov . Ann Richards , under whose leadership most agreed the state thrived , Texas appears ready to rebuke Clinton . And like Richards , Blum &; Weprin says , Clinton seems somewhat undeserving of his fate . <p> Four years ago , the president identified the economy as his top priority , as did more than half of Texans . Today it 's a distant second on the priority list , with a majority of Texans feeling no pinch . <p> " " Apparently , that has n't translated into any benefit for Clinton , " said Blum . " " On many issues , the government appears to be doing a good job . Still , it 's get rid of the incumbent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dole if next November 's election were held today , according to the poll . <p> More importantly , perhaps , Texans are rejecting issues dear to Clinton , such as dispatching troops to keep peace in Bosnia . <p> Only 2 percent of those polled felt America 's role in the world is a high-priority issue . And almost half of those who think the U.S. role in the world should be among the nation 's top two concerns feel that America is too ready to commit troops where U.S. interests are not threatened . <p> " " Why do n't this country try to help its own ? " said Buddy Nixon , who buys and sells odds and ends in Texarkana . " " You got a slice of bread , you got ta feed your own kids before you feed the neighbor 's . " <p> For some Texas voters , the U.S. mission to Bosnia underscores what they see as a glaring lack of government accountability . <p> In fact , some see it no differently than , say , allegations of inappropriate travel by Energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deploy troops as an election-year ploy despite its inherent political risk . <p> " " Why am I paying taxes for that idiot to go to Bosnia ? " said Jacqueline Hodgson , a former college professor who lives in San Antonio . " " You really think Clinton 's accountable for his actions ? He 's not accountable for anything . " <p> Hodgson 's rage suggests that , while recent national polls show the electorate mellowing , Texas voters are still downright mad . Blum says this reflects , in part , the timing of the poll , taken during the second government shutdown . But , she says , it also reflects a certain defiance among Texans . <p> " " In Texas we see . . . more anger , " said Blum . " " It 's less government , less taxes , less regulation . These are not fans of Washington . " <p> Yet Texas voters want the federal government more involved in education , which ranked fourth on the state 's priority list . <p> Among those who identified education as one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more federal money going to public schools . Among Democrats polled , that figure rose to 50 percent . <p> Texans who see education as one of their top two concerns would not stop there . A quarter of them say Washington should do more to keep troubled kids in school . And nearly one in five thinks standards should be higher . <p> " " We need to look at education as if we 're fighting for our very existence , " said Roy Treadway , a Fort Worth special education instructor . " " We 're dealing with the life and death of our culture . " Though Treadway is a self-styled liberal Democrat who curses the Republican revolution , the poll shows that more conservative Texans somehow manage to reconcile their repudiation of federal government with their wish for more public school funding . <p> Such inconsistencies are apparent elsewhere in the poll . Texas voters want a balanced budget , but not at the cost of shutting down the government . They say their children will be better off financially but worry about how they will deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficit . They want to do away with federal assistance programs , but not with Medicare and Medicaid . <p> Smith , the elderly woman from Hughes Springs , illustrates the point . Though she heartily endorses the Republican strategy to gut the New Deal and the Great Society , Smith identifies Medicare and Medicaid as her second-highest priority . Her concern : that the elderly will lose out on benefits . <p> " " I used Medicaid for a cataract operation not long ago , " she said . Several breaths later , Smith said , " " I do not believe in depending on the government . " <p> Others , presumably those less dependent on it , see Medicare and Medicaid as a priority because of what it costs the taxpayer in fraud and waste . Of those who see Medicare and Medicaid as one of the nation 's top two priorities , about a third worried about waste . <p> Still more - 42 percent - identified Medicare and Medicaid as one of the top two issues because they worried cuts will mean less for the elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas voters seem to believe that government should be in the business of helping people . <p> One such person is Merle Berger , 66 , from Shiner , which lies between San Antonio and Houston . Her husband was recently laid off from the Kaspar Iron Works , where she also worked for most of her life . Seldom , she says , is there any money left at the end of the month . <p> " " If they cut Medicaid , we just wo n't have a chance , " she said . <p> " " A lot of old people , that 's all they got . " <p> Berger is a reminder that the economy is still a significant issue for many - despite the poll 's finding that most Texans are content . <p> Among those who ranked the economy as their top two concerns , more than a quarter said it 's getting harder to make ends meet . Nearly a quarter worried about jobs moving overseas . And almost one in five is concerned about the growing gap between rich and poor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It just seems like the jobs are playing out , " said Berger . <p> " " There are no jobs to be found . At least none that pay anything . " <p> Nixon , the Texarkana man , says that explains why crime is a problem . Though only 9 percent of those polled identified crime as their top concern , Nixon says he is increasingly fearful for himself and his family . And , he says , the economy is responsible . <p> " " You 've got these people with nowhere to go but crime and violence . " he said . " " They do n't have any choices . They never have a chance . " <p> But while Texans may agree that crime is a problem , they are split on why . Among those who see it as one of the top two issues facing the country , more than one in three say prisons are too lenient and that criminals are released too early . <p> A little more than a quarter , meanwhile , side with Nixon , saying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's educate these people and put ' em to work , " said Nixon . <p> " " At least the ones who want to work .
