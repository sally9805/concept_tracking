Here 's a way to earn 10% or 20% on tiny sums : pay small monthly bills two or three at a time . This would n't be worth discussing  --  I can tell by the dignified way you carry yourself that tiny sums mean nothing to you  --  except that it will save you time as well . That 's the real point here . Still , it 's nice to know the numbers work too . <P> Take your $20 gas bill . Paying two months at once , $40 instead of $20 , ties . up an extra $20 but saves a stamp  --  29 cents  --  and the trouble of having to pay the bill next month . Twenty-nine cents is a " return " of 1.45% on a one- month " investment " of $20 , or nearly 19% a year compounded . <P> Of course , not all your bills are the same each month . But even if the amount varies , all but the most amateur of creditors will have no trouble applying your overpayment to future balances . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus $50 on account . " Your next bill will reflect a " credit  --  do not pay . " <P> Not only that , you 'll have the cleanest credit record in town . " How 's his payment history ? " one computer may ask another . " He pays early ! " the other may flash back . " Aw , c'm on , " the first computer will say . " No , really ! Here  --  look ! " Whereupon the first computer will look over the second computer 's shoulder and sniff its perfume , and airline reservations clerks around the country will frown and say , " Sorry , my system just went down . " All because of you . <P> The table that follows shows the " returns " you earn on each early payment , taking into account only the postal savings . If you 'd also save on the cost of checks or envelopes  --  let alone the hefty per-check fee some banks charge if you fall below their minimum balance  --  so much the better . <P> But even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say , you pay four $10 monthly bills in a lump  --  the $10 you owe now , plus three additional early payments . As the table shows , on that first early payment , the $10 you tie up is " earning " about a 36% annualized rate of return . The second is earning about 18% , and the third  --  $10 tied up for three months to save 29 cents in postage  --  is earning an annualized 12% . <P> Obviously , the smaller the bill , the more sense it makes to pay early . Lumping four $10 monthly bills makes a lot more sense than lumping four mortgage payments . But as the table shows , even on a $60 monthly bill , doubling up cuts the chore in half and " earns " you 6% . <P> Note that : <P>  --  These returns are actually understated . For simplicity , they do n't take into effect compounding . ( But no matter how high your rate of return in percentage terms , it 's still only 29 cents , so I guess there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The returns are " tax free " ( unless you 're a profitable business , in which case the savings add to your profit , which is taxed ) . <P>  --  If you already pay 20% interest on everything  --  your life 's a revolving charge card  --  then borrowing more to " earn " 18% in saved postage makes no sense .
