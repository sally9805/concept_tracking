To say that Curtis Redding of Philadelphia has been through a lot in his 18 years is an understatement . He grew up fatherless , had a mother on drugs , saw siblings shipped off to foster homes and has lived in more homeless shelters than he cares to recall . But that did n't stop him from recently being named the top-ranking student with a 98.275 average and class valedictorian during graduation ceremonies at Strawberry Mansion High School in the city . Redding , who just started his freshman year at the University of Pennsylvania on a scholarship covering practically all his expenses , told JET he sometimes thought he 'd never survive his environment because the deck was stacked against him . " I felt like that a lot of time , " he said , but I had to realize that was just the circumstances . All I had to do was continue to do what I was doing : doing what was right and what was good . " Though the long road from the innercity to the Ivy League halls of Penn was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother always taught us that we were n't going to have things given to us on a silver platter . So , I knew though things were kind of rough , they could only get better . " Redding said the key to his survival was that while he was going from one school to another while living in various homeless shelters , he 'd always find someone at school to confide in who would inevitably offer a helping hand . " I always tried to look for someone who would be there to help me , " he began , adding , " Knowing I needed a help , I 'd look to others who had the resources . " He said a lot of time youngsters in dire straits do n't get the assistance they need " because they 're so embarrassed and they do n't want people to know their business . But everybody could see what was going on in my family , so I had to put pride in the back pocket . " Just having a caring , concerned adult to take him under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of school . And while he had always been a capable student , he admitted doing just enough to get by in classes . But a love letter to a ninth-grade classmate changed all that . " I wrote her a love letter and she marked up the letter where I had made mistakes . She wrote at the bottom , ' Please watch for spelling and grammar , ' I kept that letter for about two years . It was my inspiration for a long time , " he said with a laugh . " I learned I had to empower myself by obtaining knowledge . Skating by was n't going to get me anywhere , " he said . " After that , I never got a " B " on my report card again . I said , I 've got to keep up these A 's . " After completing his undergraduate studies , Redding dreams of getting an MBA , a law degree and even a degree in theology . " I 've been blessed and God has given me a message to help others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born . My mom and grandmother made sure I had a spiritual foundation . I strayed away , but I had that foundation so it was easy to come back . " He wants to study religion because , " I just want to learn more , so when I talk to kids it 's not just what I think or what I know , it can be based on the Bible . " In his moving valedictorian address , Redding poured his heart out to school teachers , administrators and the 115 members of the graduating class and their families and friends . " I told them some of the problems I went through and that I 'm not the only one . There are people who have gone through more . ( If they need help ) they need to get out here and look for the resources and not be embarrassed or afraid . " He also told them , " The ones who are well off , open up your doors and your hearts to others because you do n't know when you may need some help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
