A world of information awaits you on the Internet . But how will you find it ? <p> Imagine New York City without street signs , the Kalahari Desert without a map , hieroglyphics without the Rosetta stone , Now you 're beginning to see what it 's like to journey the Internet , a worldwide network that 's spreading like kudzu throughout cyberspace with no end in sight . According to reliable estimates , more than 20 million people worldwide tap into the Internet today . And that number is growing by 150,000 users a month . <p> What is the Internet ? It 's a collection of thousands of interlinked computer networks that communicate with each other using a common computer language , or protocol . By accessing the Net , as it 's popularly known , users can exchange Email , chat live , log on remotely to other computers , and download copies of files from other computers to their own machines . <p> But the Internet is far more than that . It 's also a virtual community-a living , breathing place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do battle over topics as varied as medieval English literature , artificial intelligence , male-female relationships , and Star Trek trivia . <p> John Perry Barlow , the lyricist for the Grateful Dead who cofounded the Electronic Frontier Foundation with Mitch Kapor of Lotus , described the Internet as " a state of minds . " <p> " It 's almost certainly the most important thing to happen to information since Gutenberg let words out of the abbey , " Barlow wrote in a foreword to NetGuide , a newly published directory of cyberspace services and destinations . " I increasingly suspect it may alter what it is to be human more than any technological development since the capture of fire . " <p> Heady stuff , to be sure . But , for all its many marvels , the Internet is still not quite ready for prime time . Unlike commercial online services such as Prodigy , CompuServe , and America Online , the Internet has no 800 number to call to get a starter kit , very little point-and-click navigational software , and no technical support staff to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet computers communicate in UNIX terms , with which DOS and Mac users may have only a glancing familiarity . <p> And if something goes wrong on the Internet-if the system crashes , a hacker pilfers your password , or a computer in Helsinki neglects to forward your mail there 's nobody to call up and complain to . <p> " The advantages of the Internet are that it 's very widespread and very flexible , " says Steve Souza , a home based computer consultant with WestWorld Engineering in San Jose . " The disadvantages are that it 's not a product , it 's not a company , it 's not a service . If it 's broken , tough beans . " <p> If the Internet 's infrastructure s quirky , you can thank-or blame-the U.S. government . Set up in 1969 as a way to link the U.S. Defense Department with university researchers working on sensitive government projects , the Internet has no central computer that stores its gigabytes of information . That 's because the government feared that a I its valuable military data could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data were housed in one place . As a result , the Internet became a decentralized network with data stored on each of the thousands of computers throughout it-even though government traffic is now only a small part of the data that flows back and forth . <p> Consider Internet E-mail . When an Internet user in Chicago wants to send a message to an Internet user in Budapest , the Internet does n't send that message directly from point A to point B. Though the Internet carries its data over phone lines like commercial services , the network has more in common with the post office than the phone company . Unlike the phone system , which wires every home and business into its network , the postal-like Internet takes your electronic letter , mixes it in with everybody else 's mail , and shoots it off to another online post office , which sorts it again and sends it on until your mail finally reaches its destination . Instead of nine-number zip codes , the Internet uses E-mail addresses and protocols ( or rules ) that tell each computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surprisingly , the whole process typically takes no longer than several minutes and is so efficient that CompuServe , Prodigy , and the other commercial online services have informally adopted the Internet as the mail delivery system of choice for users of the various services to communicate with one another . <p> Even so , the Internet 's decentralized structure can be frustrating and confusing for modem users accustomed to the relative ease of use that commercial online services offer . Unlike with CompuServe 's CIM or WinCIM , for example , you ca n't click on a little traffic light that represents the " Go " command and type in the keyword , work , to visit the Working from Home Forum . Unlike with America Online , you ca n't click on an icon with two faces to zap you over to the part of the system where you can engage in live chat . On the Internet , there are thousands of discussion groups , known as mailing lists , that wo n't even let you in unless you subscribe-using the Internet address , of course . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online services are so easy to use and offer the full range of news , sports , and weather plus hundreds of bulletin boards and access to Internet mail ? There are many good reasons to access the Internet . Price . Depending on how much time you spend online and what you like to do there , the Internet can be a lot cheaper than the commercial online services . Most dial-up Internet access providers offer unlimited Internet access for a flat fee of from $15.00 to $30.00 a month . While that 's more than the $9.95 a month that America Online charges for access , you can stay online as long as you like ; DELPHI Internet Services , the first with the most in terms of commerical Internet access , offers 20 hours of access per month for $20 ( $1.80 an hour for access over 20 hours ; another rate structure is also available ) . America Online charges $3.50 an hour after the first five " free " hours are up . And , unlike with CompuServe and Prodigy , there are no extra charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Variety . Even though the commercial online services offer a wide range of special-interest bulletin boards on topics ranging from computers to pet care to food and wine , the Internet offers access to thousands of Usenet " newsgroups " ( the equivalent of bulletin boards ) and mailing lists on topics as esoteric as German TV cartoon characters and UFO sightings . And , if you do n't find what you 're looking for in an existing newsgroup or discussion group , you can start your own . Usenet newsgroups about Star Trek , for example , include rec.arts.startrek.misc ( which covers Star Trek in all its generations and media ) , **25;506;TOOLONG ( Star Trek gossip , jokes , and production information ) , and rec.arts. startrek.reviews ( reviews of Star Trek books , episodes , and films ) . People . Taken together , the five largest U.S.-based online servicesProdigy , CompuServe , America Online , GEnie , and DELPHI-have roughly 4 million subscribers , most of them in the United States . The Internet , by contrast , has 20 million users all over the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the commercial online services is English ; on the Internet , people from all over the world chat live and exchange messages in dozens of different languages . Accessibility . Though CompuServe and GEnie offer some directdial access overseas ( primarily in Europe ) , Prodigy and America Online are available only by placing a very expensive international call . The Internet , by contrast , offers local dialup access worldwide . Databases . Arguably the world 's largest library , the Internet lets you access the Library of Congress card catalog , the New York Public Library Online Catalog , and millions of pages of U.S. government data , all without paying a dime . The Internet 's Wide Area Information Servers ( WAIS ) tool lets you search multiple databases at the same time , a help if you 're not sure where to find what you 're looking for . Things to Do , Places to Go <p> The Internet offers a cornucopia of culture , both high and low .

Netiquette <p> The folks on the Internet can be unforgiving of people who break their rules . The trouble is , unlike the commercial online services , the Internet has no central authority to cast its rules in stone . Break the rules , however , and punishment will be swift : Transgressors will almost certainly be flamed ( verbally attacked ) . <p> Here are some basic tips to help you duck the flamethrowers . Do n't type your public messages in all capital letters . On the Net , that means you 're shouting ( and it 's considered quite rude ) . Avoid profanity and abusive language . Be brief and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Think before you write . Once you 've cast your words upon the Net , you ca n't take them back . - Respond to a public posting only if you have something meaningful to say . Do n't plagiarize . If you 're quoting from another source , give credit where credit is due . Stay on point . Do n't stray from the news group 's or mailing list 's stated purpose . Do n't advertise or send junk mail . It 's illegal on government-controlled portions of the Net , and even in those places where it is allowed , it will probably annoy the very people you 're trying to entice . Internet Tools and Features <p> Here are the useful tools you 'll find on the Internet for dealing with data . <p> E-mail . The Internet makes it possible for users to exchange electronic mail with other users around the world in addition to subscribers to commercial online services such as CompuServe , GEnie , America Online , DELPHI , and The WELL . In addition , you can subscribe to mailing lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topics . I also the electronic journal journal ) . E-journals are either distributed to a list of subscribers as an E-mail text message or re a particular a downloading . File Transfer Protocol ( F T P ) <p> Another widely used feature of the Internet is its ability to transfer files from one Internet-connected computer to another . FTP allows Internet users to search for , list , and retrieve files ; the Internet 's Archie service indexes files from over 900 FTP sites . <p> Finger . The Internet 's Finger command lets you access identifying information ( such as full name and postal address ) about anyone with an Internet mailing address . <p> Gopher . Gopher , a project of the University of Minnesota , is a menu-driven service that lets users browse the Internet 's resources , read text files , and retrieve files of all kinds . <p> Internet addresses . Internet mail addresses consist of three parts : a computer name , a location , and a domain ( or type of site ) name . Here is a sample address:71333,1473@ compuserve.com . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place of the computer name . ( If this were n't an address on a commercial service , an actual computer name would be listed . ) The next part of the address , compuserve , is the location ( another example would be AOL for America Online or UWA for University of Washington ) the last part of the address , com , is the domain name ; com stands for commercial ( another is edu for education or gov for government ) . <p> Internet Relay Chat . Popularly known as I R C , Internet Relay Chat is the Internet 's world-wide , multi-lingual chat board- like CompuServe 's CB Simulator and America Online 's People Connection but bigger and more chaotic . IRC is divided into hundreds of categories , where users talk live around the clock about everything from Russian politics to true romance . Like the commercial services , IRC lets you go private to chat about things that you do n't want the whole Net to know about . <p> Telnet . Telnet , or remote log-or , enables a computer user in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer somewhere else . Once the connection is made , the remote user can use that system as if that computer were part of his or her own network . Telnet can be used to access everything from bibliographic databases ( primarily library catalogs ) to computer bulletin boards and interactive role-playing games . <p> Usenet . Not officially part of the Internet , Usenet is a collection of millions of E-mail messages organized by subject categories called newsgroups . They are the Internet equivalent of the special-interest bulletin boards available on the commercial online services , though much more specialized . There are two kinds of newsgroups : official ( voted in by a majority of Internet site administrators ) and alternative . Official newsgroups contain the prefix comp ( for computer-related topics ) , news ( for topics related to Usenet itself ) , rec ( for recreation , hobbies , and the arts ) , sci ( for science and research ) , soc ( for society and culture ) , talk ( for issues and debate ) , or misc . Alternative newsgroups , which start with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are more than 2500 alt newsgroups . <p> Wide Area Information Servers ( WAIS ) . A joint project of Thinking Machines , Apple Computer , Dow Jones , and KPMG Peat Marwick , WAIS is a powerful searching tool that lets users search over 300 Internet sources with a single keyword . <p> Whois . Though there 's no comprehensive directory of Internet mail addresses , the Internet 's Whois feature provides a limited directory of Internet users and a utility for searching it . Getting Online <p> Right now , the biggest obstacle to exploring the Internet is that it is difficult to use . Dozens of software developers are pioneering Windows interfaces that offer point-and-click access to the Internet 's E-mail , Gopher , WAIS , Telnet , FTP , and other features , And some of the books now coming on the market such as Michael Fraase 's PC Internet Tour Guide : Cruising the Internet the Easy Way-come with easy-to-use interfaces bundled on disks , <p> What 's the future of the Internet ? Some experts predict that it will swell to 100 million users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on from their television sets , their screen phones , and their personal digital assistants . Others speculate that the Internet will be paved over by corporate communications giants eager to build an information superhighway . <p> But whatever the future may hold for the network of networks that is called the Internet , the virtual community that it has spawned will almost certainly live on  --  and prosper . <p> By Rosalind Resnick <p> BOOKWARE <p> Want to bone up on the Internet ?

In the body of the message , type unsubscribe nethappenings firstname lastname . <p> GETTING ACCESS <p> If you do n't have free access to the Internet through a university or research institution you can pay from $15 to $30 a month for what 's known as a dial-up account from an Internet access provider . This lets you dial up the Internet just as you would a commercial online service or a bulletin board and gives you unlimited access to Internet features such as E-mail , Gopher , WAIS , World Wide Web , Telnet , FTP , and IRC . <p> Down the road , however , you may find yourself ( or your company ) wanting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , allowing you to , say , download a file while you 're accessing a Gopher site . When you access the Internet through a SLIP ( Serial Line Interface Protocol ) or a PPP ( Point-to-Point Protocol ) , the modem on your computer or on your local area network connects to the Internet provider 's host computer , which is connected directly to the Internet . A SLIP connection generally costs about $160 to $250 a month with a one-time installation fee of $1,500 . <p> Here is a partial list of Internet access providers ( a more comprehensive list can be obtained from Susan Estrada 's Connecting to the Internet. - Ann O'Reilly Buyer 's Guide ) .
