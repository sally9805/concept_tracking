<p> Cucina Roma <p> ( STAR ) ( STAR ) <p> Address : Just off Route 83 and Ogden Avenue , at St. James Crossing , Westmont <p> Phone : ( 708 ) 654-9600 <p> Hours : Lunch , Monday-Saturday 11 a.m. -3 p.m . Dinner , Monday-Saturday 5-10 p.m. ; Sunday 4-10 p.m . <p> Prices : appetizers , $ 3.50-$ 5.95 ; pizzas $ 4.95-$ 6.25 ; pasta , $ 7.95-$ 11.25 ; entrees , $ 8.95-$ 18.95 ; desserts , $ 2-$ 4 . <p> Reservations : Not accepted , but you can call ahead and get your name on the waiting list . <p> Credit cards : American Express , Diners Club , Discover , MasterCard , Visa <p> Parking : free lot <p> Wheelchair accessible ? yes <p> Atmosphere : Nice casual with a Tuscan look that takes the shape of sponged walls stenciled with a trellis and grapevine pattern . Tables are covered with green-checked cloth and paper . Floors are hardwood and nicely polished . Woven baskets and antiques abound through the various dining areas , which are separated by high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tables are close together . Very pleasant , high-energy feeling to the room . A friendly bar area makes the wait for a table bearable . The Espresso Roma Cafe is adjacent to the bar area . <p> Service : Friendly , no-attitude service staff who , though always on the go , stop to take the time to extend a greeting and explain the specials . <p> Recommended dishes : friselle , pizza , rigatoni antica , veal parmigiana , cannoli . <p> Wines : Short yet serious <p> list ( some out-of-the-ordinary selections that a label-chasing wine snob would love ) that is evenly divided between Italian reds and whites . Eno Friulia Chardonnay ( $ 22 ) , and the excellent value ( wicker bottle ) Graziosi Chianti Chianti ( $ 17 ) are two good possibilities . The Fontanafredda Barolo ( $ 29 ) would be my upper-end choice . <p> It 's in the sauce . The caliber of the red sauce is the only way to tell if an Italian restaurant is a big gun or a small pistola . It 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sauce or oil and garlic sauce or carbonara sauce , but when you put the mettle to the kettle , it 's the goodness of the red sauce that sets the winners apart from the also-rans . <p> Cucina Roma in Westmont is a winner . It makes a fine red sauce . In fact , it makes a variety of fine red sauces . I tried the " light pomodoro " on the veal parmigiana , the " spicy marinara " on one of the daily specials , the " old-fashioned tomato meat sauce " on the spaghetti Bolognese , and the " plum tomato " sauce on the pizza . Four hits and no misses . <p> Some cooks in Italian restaurant kitchens still do n't get it . If you cook a red sauce to death , you kill it . There is no need to cook a red sauce for more than two hours , period . What happens in a restaurant kitchen all too often is that the sauce sits in a pot at a simmer all day long . The sauce thickens , so somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ; chicken or beef stock , yes , but not water ) . And if that sauce happens to be sitting in an aluminum pot , the situation becomes simply sinful . The tomatoes take on a metallic taste , so the flavor of the sauce becomes something like what you would get if you licked the gutter on your house . <p> Of course , if a red sauce starts off with the right tomatoes , a lot of problems can be avoided . I have n't the foggiest idea what kind of tomatoes Cucina Roma starts with , or how the cooks handle their sauces , but I was pretty impressed with the results . <p> Top Italian <p> Now that I 've got the tomato thing off my chest , let me say that Cucina Roma is one of the few good Italian restaurants in the western suburbs ( it 's in the same class as Sergino 's in Wheaton , another favorite of mine ) , which undoubtedly is the reason it 's packed with customers most of the time . <p> At first glance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the Italian menus out there , but on closer inspection the culinary music starts to swell . The frisella ( spelled " frizelle " on the menu ) , for example , is an impressive and delicious appetizer . Frisella is a ring-shaped roll that is baked , cut in half horizontally and baked again . The result is that it becomes very crusty . The Cucina Roma version crowns it with chopped tomatoes , onion , salami , provolone cheese , fresh basil and Italian dressing . <p> Notable , too , is the use of Romano cheese on a number of dishes . I happen to believe that in certain situations Romano cheese delivers more of a flavor edge than , say , Parmesan . So in another appetizer , polenta con funghi , a lusty arrangement of polenta made with Romano cheese , wild mushrooms and a mushroom-accented tomato sauce , the layers of flavor are impressive . <p> A slight dip occurred with the baked clams . Although the littlenecks were fresh and clean-tasting , there was a mushiness to an otherwise tasty Romano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the broiler , the mushiness would have disappeared . <p> Pizza and pasta <p> Pizzas are about 8 inches in diameter and perfect for an individual appetizer course or to share as a tasting course ( they are nicely priced at around $ 5.50 , too ) . We sampled but one  --  the tomato , basil and mozzarella version  --  and liked it a lot . The medium-thick crust had some texture and chew to it ( as opposed to a paper-thin , cardboard-box-tasting crust , which I find offensive ) . The toppings were excellently balanced and fresh-tasting . <p> The pasta choices are top-drawer , yet sensibly priced ( average is $ 10 ) . If you like your pasta bold , have the rigatoni antica , a lusty combination of pasta , chunks of grilled plum tomatoes , spears of fresh asparagus , onions and roasted red peppers in a light tomato sauce that gets a hit of cream . This excellent dish bursts with flavor . <p> A pasta special , shrimp with spaghetti in a spicy marinara sauce , was simplicity at its best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fresh-tasting marinara sauce topped with six nicely cooked medium shrimp . Could n't ask for anything more . <p> Well , maybe one thing more . In the farfalle alla Stefano , butterfly pasta ( a.k.a. bow ties ) are tossed with the tiniest cuttings of fresh asparagus , peas , onion and slivers of porcini mushrooms . A light tomato sauce tinted with cream makes this dish sing . <p> Entrees <p> A nice idea on the menu is something called " Cucina Lite . " The six choices that are lower in calories and fat include fettuccine primavera ; grilled chicken breast limone ; radiatore pasta with a fresh tomato , garlic and herb sauce ; veal limone ; linguine with broccoli and shrimp ; and fettuccine with grilled chicken and fresh tomatoes . Though I did n't sample any of them , I like the idea . <p> There is nothing light about the giambotta , however . For those not familiar with this button-popping Italian dish , let me explain . Load a platter with hunks and chunks of Italian sausage , roasted sweet peppers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all with a fruity olive oil ( actually , some places cook it all together with the olive oil , white wine and herbs ) , grab on to some crusty Italian bread and go for it . It 's not for timid or prone-to-heartburn types . it should be , not entombed in a mass of cheese and heavy tomato sauce . Cucina Roma 's version of this classic is light ( the veal is not breaded ) and delicious ( the pomodoro sauce is exquisite ) . It has been a long time since I 've had a veal parmigiana this good . <p> Desserts <p> Certainly the choices were varied enough . Everything from carrot cake to cannoli was on the tray that is presented tableside . So where did we go with this ? To the tiramisu , of course . And what did we find ? Not much . The same old tired ( actually the name means to " lift " or " pick up " ) rendition with the same old polyester texture . On the other hand , the cannoli serving was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( so the cannoli were filled to order ) and the pistachio-studded ricotta filling was properly sweet and smooth . Though I 'm not much of a bread pudding fan , I was surprised at how good Cucina Roma 's was , warm , light and with a decent caramel sauce . <p> New dessert idea of the week ( I 'm really trying to get restaurants to think beyond those terrible tiramisus ) : How about a bread pudding that is laced with a lemon zabaione sauce and topped with an espresso syrup ? <p> Friday in WeekendPlus : Just in time for the holiday season , Pat Bruno sifts through the pleasures of a few fine bakeries. @x Consumers have heard for years that solar , wind , and geothermal power might soon cut their monthly energy bills . But things get exciting , even exotic , looking a decade or two ahead . Scientists envision that light bulbs will talk to switches , furnaces to windows , and everything to the Internet . Homes generate their own power in basement plants . Windows and paint change color to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing for scientists to talk game and another for builders and homeowners to play . Cutting home energy use means changing consumer behavior and industry practice . " The construction trades are among the most conservative out there , " says Leon Glicksman , a professor of building technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . It 's also a highly fragmented , diffuse industry of mostly small contractors installing separate systems in a home . One does heating , another lighting , a third the electrical system . There often is nobody who integrates the many systems with an eye to energy savings . So as much as scientists like to talk whiz-bang for the future , what 's also needed is training . " It 'll be interesting to see 10 or 20 years from now how much progress is technology oriented and how much is education based , " says Dariush Arasteh , who studies building technology at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory . That said , promising new technologies are emerging in labs , and some in commercial buildings , that in a decade or two could win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tints . In most U.S. climates , there is no easy answer when looking for energy-efficient windows . Today 's panes tend to be specific to a type of weather -- glass can be treated to reflect sunlight for warm-weather areas or not reflect it for colder climes . " If you 're in St. Louis , you ideally want one in summer and another in winter , " says Arasteh , whose lab studies window energy use . Intense research is focusing on smarter windows that can change their coating on demand . A tint could block the sun in hot weather but fade on cold days to let in warm rays . Special " electrochromic " coatings darken when a small voltage is applied . A Minnesota company , Sage Electrochromics , already sells early versions that are used in some high-end homes , usually as skylights . At current high prices , they make more economic sense for commercial buildings . Factories and offices could reduce daytime lighting costs with more windows but ca n't afford to let in the sun 's heating rays . Homes tend to need more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illumination . Still , commercial sales can help fine-tune production to get costs down . Then the entire window-producing industry must revamp itself for the new tech , an issue that has held up other energy-saving approaches , such as triple-pane windows . " It 's like having a factory that 's set up to make simple sandwiches , " says Arasteh . " Now you 're asking them to make club sandwiches . These changes take years . " Smart homes . Existing home heating , cooling , and lighting systems could save energy with some new smarts . Lights typically do n't know they can turn off or dim when the sun comes up , and air handlers continue blowing heated or cooled air at open windows . Simple networking that got all of them talking could wring out a third of energy use in a building , says Neil Gershenfeld , an MIT computer science professor : " It 's sort of an Internet of things . " Many companies have tried for the smart home . About 20 different families of gear already exist . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none can expand to handle complex systems while being cheap enough to work with a simple light bulb . Gershenfeld 's lab has developed a data . The same code could control complicated heating and cooling systems that respond to outside temperature changes , or as people come and go . Prototypes already exist of hardware that a homeowner might install cheaply , even in an existing structure . One attraction : " We do n't have to rewire the whole building , " says Charlie Catlett , chief information officer at Argonne National Laboratory , which is installing an early test of the system in one of its buildings . Plus , " these things are so cheap and small that we can actually think about putting them into things like chairs and light bulbs . " Frozen smoke . Nothing is weirder than the aerogel that might one day keep our homes comfy . One of the lightest solids known to man , the translucent and wispy material looks like a slice of solid smoke . It 's about 99 percent gas trapped in nano-size bubbles within a lacelike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given thickness . " The problem is that for now it 's expensive as heck , " says Andre Desjarlais at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory . But breaking into the construction industry , which uses nearly two thirds of all insulation produced , is a priority for the few small companies " says Aspen Aerogels CEO Don Young . That means retrofitting existing structures , particularly older masonry walls with no hollows for stuffing conventional insulation . Public partners are helping to pay to install aerogel insulation in more than 250 New York City housing units as an early test . For now , though , aerogel will largely remain a tool for space agencies , the Pentagon , and oil companies that can pay the steep premium . Desjarlais 's lab at Oak Ridge focuses on technology to secure the building " envelope " for energy efficiency . It includes a number of bizarre-sounding technologies , such as paint that 's white one minute to reflect sunlight and later darkens to collect it . But nothing can top the weird nature of frozen smoke . Home hydrogen . Fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies hope they 'll soon be ready for cars . In a decade or two , they should be commonly available for the basement , says Tom Drennen , an associate professor at Hobart and William Smith Colleges and coauthor of Pathways to a Hydrogen Future . " There 's a lot of efficiency in generating electricity where it is used , " he says . Fuel cells generate electricity through a chemical process that combines hydrogen and oxygen . When the inputs are pure , the only side products are water and heat in a process that 's long been perfected . " What 's not perfected is getting the fuel , the hydrogen , to them , " says Branko Terzic , a Deloitte consultant on energy policy . A few Japanese companies have installed experimental models in homes that run off natural gas . An added device strips hydrogen from the gas to fuel the cells , which generate electricity and hot water . A smaller slice of American homes have gas service , limiting that approach here . Converting natural gas also produces greenhouse gases . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And nothing 's wasted getting it to the home , " Drennen says . Brighter bulbs . Here 's a twist on the old joke : In a few decades , nobody will know what it even means to change a light bulb . " The house will get torn down before a light bulb ever burns out , " says Russell Dupuis , a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology and fan of light-emitting diodes , or LEDs . The 130-year-old Edison bulbs will first get replaced in the home by compact fluorescents , which use about a third the energy and last years longer . Even more miserly LEDs are expected to later replace fluorescents . LEDs use about 12 percent the energy of incandescents and can last 50 years or more . They 've already become popular in some commercial settings , particularly where lights burn 24-7 -- such as the freezer at an all-night Wal-Mart . Steep initial costs limit their appeal to U.S. homeowners . People just ca n't embrace spending $120 or $130 on a bulb . While even that steep price can earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too long for the typically nomadic U.S. homeowner . Dupuis dreams that people soon will ask whether a prospective home has LED lights and will pay more for one that does . He should -- he built a passel of them into his house . Home Improved Houses are tough to put on an energy diet , with styles and lifestyles as varied as their inhabitants . But homes in 2025 could be islands of efficiency , producing their own power while wrapped in an envelope of exotic windows and walls . SMART HOMES Extending the smart grid into the home connects every device to the Internet and to one another . Furnaces know to quit blowing when windows are open . Lamps dim or switch off when no one 's home or ambient light is bright enough . AEROGEL INSULATION Nano- technology creates tiny bubbles in a translucent material that is the lightest solid known to man . Aerogel is the best insulation for a given thickness , meaning sheets so thin that retrofitting old homes preserves existing contours . NEXT-GEN WINDOWS Panes automatically change their tint with electrochromic coatings that darken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light to let pass depending on season or hour . Windows thus produce more energy than they leak . FUEL CELLS Hydrogen powers homes with the same technology that has been used for decades in spacecraft . Early fuel cells that draw hydrogen from natural gas generate some pollution . Ultimately , they operate so cleanly that the only byproducts are water and heat . LED LIGHTING Solid-state bulbs are more efficient than old-style incandescent lamps and the fluorescent lights that initially replace them . LEDs convert most of their energy to light , while traditional incandescent bulbs lose most of theirs as heat .
