DID YOU NOTICE THE COPS STANDING BEHIND BILL CLINTON AS THE PRESIdent unveiled his crime-fighting package last week ? Almost all were from the neighborhood , from Washington and its surrounding suburbs . That 's no big deal , of course ; any blue will do for a law-and-order photo-op . But the absence of officers from all over the U.S. ( the norm for decades whenever uniforms have gathered to support a President 's latest war on crime ) tells a tale . Clinton 's proposals , a grab bag of familiar notions , were hastily introduced . That does n't mean they 're bad or ill conceived  --  the Administration worked on them for months  --  but the speed of their introduction is all about politics , a desire to trump the anticrime initiatives that Senate Republican leader Bob Dole announced on Aug. 4 . <P> Unfortunately , Clinton has shortchanged one of the few truly new ( and good ) ideas in years  --  the Police Corps proposal authored by Adam Walinsky , a New York lawyer who served as Robert Kennedy 's top aide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swap . Each year , competitively selected high school seniors would win federal financing for their college education ; in exchange , they would serve four years as local police officers after graduation . The corps promises four benefits : <P> 1 ) Compared with regular cops , they would be a bargain . It costs about $55,000 a year to pay and equip the average officer . Primarily because of reduced pension benefits , corps members would cost about a third less . 2 ) Many urban police forces have trouble attracting qualified minority recruits . A Justice Department survey has concluded that many inner-city youths would gravitate to the corps ' service-for-college trade . 3 ) The infusion of college graduates would improve the overall educational level of local police forces . 4 ) Perhaps most important , says Walinsky , " a sizable number of civilians , the kinds of kids who are going to end up as lawyers or business leaders , will learn about police work firsthand and support it throughout their lives . And they , at least , will have ingrained the habits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Candidate Clinton portrayed himself as the Police Corps 's biggest fan and regularly crowed that he was the first Governor to create a Walinsky-style program  --  but Arkansas ' college-for-service deal wo n't start until 1997 . Now President Clinton has asked for $100 million over four years for a total of about 3,000 corps members . " Given the crime wave , " says Walinsky , " referring to this as a step in the right direction , as Clinton does , is like Franklin Roosevelt calling for 100 new tanks in 1941 . " Dole , who wants $250 million for the same purpose , identifies the resistance : The police chiefs " want regular cops , the kind they 're used to . They also want to spend on new , high-tech stuff , " the wrong emphasis , says Dole , because " what we need are more cops on the beat , " to deter crime by their presence and to catch those who are n't deterred . <P> Dole is right , concedes a White House aide , " but we did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push us . In fact , we would n't mind the proposal of those other Senators , " a bipartisan group urging a full-blown Police Corps that would cost about $1.2 billion annually .
