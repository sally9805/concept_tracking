The first view of Speed Week at Bonneville is from the causeway at the edge of the Salt Flats . Several miles out from where the road ends and the salt begins , the tents and pits look like a lost circus in the heat waves on the horizon . Center ring is a black streak of oil , one of the few places for the eye to focus in the bright glare  --  a ruler-straight line that runs some ten miles out to the edge of the mountains in the distance . The line was laid down by Sir Malcom Campbell , who trucked his Rolls-Royce-powered Blue-bird to this prehistoric lake bed in 1935 to find the longest , flattest place on Earth . Campbell became the first man to drive a car faster than 300 mph , setting a wheel-driven land speed record of 301.13 mph . The speeds have been climbing ever since . Today Speed Week at Bonneville is part carnival , part family picnic , and part space launch . If you set a class record more than 200 mph here , faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a T-shirt . Go 300 mph , faster than Andretti on the back straight at Indy , faster than most light aircraft , and you get some respect . The drivers wearing 200-mph-club T-shirts hanging around the hot dog stand have nothing but respect for Al Teague . They pause at the sound of a distant racing engine , like old fighter pilots who hear an aircraft engine overhead . Out on the salt , Teague 's Spirit of ' ' 76 , a cigar-shaped aluminum tube more than 20 feet long , is accelerating down the dark oil streak . Teague is crammed into a cockpit barely wider than his shoulders , head wedged between the bars of the roll cage , aiming more than driving . He 's drowning in the sound of a monstrous supercharger pumping nitromethane and air into a racing engine that Chrysler has n't built for nearly 25 years . There is an art to this , a delicate ballet to balance the force of explosive horsepower , steering control , and air flowing over the skin of the car at twice the velocity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an F-14 Tomcat off the deck of a carrier  --  not exactly what Teague has in mind here . Carefully he adds another 100 mph to his speed each time he shifts gears , more conscious of traction and wheelslip than acceleration . But Teague 's concentration is n't quite good enough . Halfway through fourth gear , the rear wheels slip and skid , the horizon shifts crazily in his blurred vision , and the car skews to a dangerous angle from the dark line . At about 360 mph Teague cuts the throttle to stabilize the car , feels it straighten , then pops the drag chute , ending what would be his best shot this year to travel comfortably over 410 mph , the record he set by the slimmest of margins only last year when his luck and the salt held out . Vying for the wheel-driven land speed record is probably the most extraordinary technical challenge in motor sports still attempted by amateurs . " This is the kind of event where somebody can be like Henry Ford ... can sit in his garage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sipping coffee after the aborted run . The Spirit of ' ' 76 is a monument to tinkering , as well as finessing , cajoling , and tweaking . His project started 18 years ago as a modified drag racer that reached 261 mph in 1976 . " It 's a sort of backyard effort , " he admits . Teague 's lakester was a typical Salt Flats racer of its day . Ultrasimple , the basic structure is an elongated truss welded of tubular steel , covered with an aluminum body just wide enough to cover the width of the engine and the driver 's shoulders . Early lakesters were built from production car parts , and the rules still set minimum track width that means the wheels are exposed like an Indy car . Streamliners have no such restrictions . Teague 's serious effort at the record started in 1982 when the Spirit of ' ' 76 chassis was modified so that the wheels could fit inside the narrow body  --  the two front wheels are set one in front of the other , an arrangement that left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have worked as well , but this meets one of just two rules governing the car : It must have four wheels , with at least two driven and two for steering . For years , land speed record attempts were made by multi-engine cars that struggled to overcome the aerodynamic drag that stems from the frontal area of multiple-engine vehicles . Teague 's car is powered by a single , relatively narrow , supercharged Chrysler Hemi engine , burning a mixture of nitromethane and gasoline  --  an engine originally developed for drag-racing in the 1960s . Teague hit 380 mph in 1987 , 390 in 1989 , then seemed stuck for two years at slightly less than 400 mph , excruciatingly close to the 409.27 mph record set in 1965 by the Summers Brothers racing team in a four-engine streamliner . Then , in 1991 , he finished the first of two required runs with one mile clocked at 425 mph , exiting the speed traps at 432 mph  --  the fastest a wheel-driven automobile has ever gone . The return run , well under 400 mph , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land speed record was shoved up another notch . " You know , more men have been to the moon than have driven a car over 400 mph , " Teague muses . In the early years of piston engine development , land speed record attempts held much the same fascination with the public as the early days of the space race . In the 1920s and 1930s , national pride was at stake as the largest motors in existence powered monstrous efforts on the beaches at Nice , France ; Pendine Sands in South Wales ; Daytona , Fla. ; and then later , after several crashes caused by unpredictable surfaces , on dry lake beds . Not until the advances in aviation technology during World War I did airplane speeds begin to surpass the land speed record-holders ; until then , the land speed record was the fastest man had traveled by any means . But the public 's interest was already beginning to fade in 1947 when Britain 's John Cobb , driving a wheeldriven car at Bonneville , reached 394.20 mph . By then it was becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert was n't the stuff of corporate sponsorship . Cobb 's record would stand for another 17 years , and relatively few all-out efforts would be made to challenge it . The nature of top speed runs was already changing as early as the mid-1930s , when a loose-knit group of hot-rodders formed the Southern California Timing Association ( SCTA ) to sanction time trials at El Mirage dry lake north of Los Angeles . The SCTA was mainly interested in testing flat-head V8-powered roadsters  --  stripped production chassis with highly modified engines that soon evolved into one-off vehicles dubbed " lakesters . " Within a few years , many sported bodies adapted from drop tanks salvaged from World War II fighter planes . In 1936 , the SCTA got permission to run the trials at the Bonneville Salt Flats near Wendover , Utah , during an off-week in August . But their earliest efforts were hardly a challenge to the sophisticated Campbell expedition . Speed Week was a place to bring a car and see what it could do flat-out , with miles to accelerate and nothing much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car in line and took off when your turn came up . The basics that were laid down by the SCTA have n't changed much since . Times are taken at a flying mile  --  between the three- and four-mile markers on the five-mile " short " course and between the five- and six-mile markers on the ten-mile " long " course . A car close to a record in its class on its first run is parked at the far end of the course for a return run later in the day , and then an average is taken of both recorded speeds . As an amateur organization , the SCTA was willing to establish a class and publish a record speed for virtually any car or motorcycle and engine combination . This led to hundreds of published records that were essentially meaningless except to the enthusiasts who set them . Still , it was a creative ferment . " The basic idea here is to take a car and put a new engine in it , " says one entrant . That usually means stuffing one of several popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supercharged Hemi , into a chassis that perhaps once was a Porsche and is barely recognizable under the aerodynamic aids . Some have become classics , like early Studebakers with their avant-garde bodies that are still incredibly efficient ; or flat-head-powered roadsters that have gradually improved to where some brush the 200-mph mark . Bonneville today is a proving ground for any idea that comes along about high speed . In making a car go fast , the most sophisticated engineering sometimes seems only marginally superior to the intuitive feel and dogged development of backyard efforts . The loose rules also make it a breeding ground for weirdness as much as expertise . A golf cart sporting a huge wing mounted overhead , allegedly for aerodynamic downforce but primarily for shade , putters by the pits where the Jack Roush team is preparing a factory-backed Thunderbird . Out on the course , a new land speed record for diesel trucks is being set by a logging truck powered by a 16-cylinder diesel engine that would be more at home in a tugboat . A surgeon from San Francisco , waiting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the luggage compartment and pulls out a golf club . " Every doctor has a set of clubs in his car , " he grins . Nearby , a father-son team with a 100cc motorcycle with sidecar explains how they used a couple of 2X4s to line up the cowling for aerodynamics . The casual attitude and good humor , however , is deceptive . Jim Mederer 's Mazda-sponsored , turbocharged RX-7 is deadly serious at the far reaches of the car-modifier 's art . Mederer is a partner in Racing Beat , a supplier that manufactures a line of Mazda accessories . He is focused on raising his 241-mph record for the class to better than 300 mph  --  joining a truly elite group of fewer than a dozen drivers who have exceeded that speed . To do that would be an aerodynamic breakthrough for an externally stock body . The engine in the RX-7 is a carefully tuned three-rotor racing engine , fitted with three turbochargers and tested at 774 hp at 8,200 rpm on a dynamometer that Mederer designed and built in his Los Angeles shop . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production RX-7 . The body is a contemporary RX-7  --  superficially : In the modified sports class , where most modifications are permissible , it is little more than a shell covering a carefully engineered chassis . The floor is molded carbon fiber , and a roll cage is an integral part of the structure . An on-board computer monitors and logs all critical engine data at a rate of 20 samples per second . Tires are a conundrum . The big streamliners like Teague 's weigh close to three tons , and no tire company has built tires specifically for land speed record attempts since the mid-1960s . A hundred or so of the 26-ply , 500-psi tires built for Mickey Thompson are still around on the circuit , used over again even when a few layers of cord peel away from the surface . Jet-fighter tires are on a few of the slower cars but are unreliable at the highest speeds . " Firestones are still the best , " Teague says . He 's stashed away a few sets and says he has enough to continue for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his front tires are from the forward wheels of a dragster ; the rear ones are made in a race-car tire mold by Goodyear , but with extra plies . His Mazda is a meticulous effort , built with painstaking attention to detail . Every detail , as it turns out , but the weather . Sunday afternoon , the first day of the time trials , heavy clouds build and a severe storm lashes the Bonneville circus , tearing the tents from their moorings , rattling the motor homes . The surface of the salt is crusty and granular and more or less waterproof , which means the thunderstorm quickly floods the surface with an inch or two of water . There is no place for the water to drain , and it eventually takes two days for the water to evaporate , an action that levels the surface and , in fact , was what created this natural roadway to begin with . But after it dries , the water leaves the salt slippery and hazardous . The moisture content of the salt flats is critical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or too wet means lost traction . Paul Lamar , a physicist and expert in race-car aerodynamics , has calculated the salt 's coefficient of friction on a good day as sufficient to sustain an acceleration of about 0.4 g  --  the factor that is the primary limit on top speed , not horsepower or aerodynamic drag . To top 400 mph on the long course , or 300 mph on the short course , the cars must accelerate about halfway down the track at the limit of traction . It 's a two-way sprint on a skating rink . Bonneville is , after all , a lake  --  albeit a dry one most of the year . The surface today is pretty much as it was when Campbell first saw it : glaring white , so flat and featureless the drivers of vehicles criss-crossing the surface take up informal nautical tactics to avoid collisions . The two courses are laid out on the remains of an inland sea that left its ancient beaches high on the side of the surrounding mountains . Heavily laced with chemicals , nothing grows on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges , dark patches of desert soil show through and a few weeds take root . Over the years , potash mining operations pumping brine across the interstate that runs on the edge of the lake have gradually redeposited salt on the other side of the road , slowly shrinking the main lake bed . A " Save the Salt " committee has been formed , and the mining company has agreed to pump water back across the road , reversing the erosion . Unfortunately , the project is caught up in a gridlock of government studies . This is disconcerting to the racers , who have seen the course shorten by more than a mile as the lake bed shrinks . " Anyone could go faster with another 50 feet , " notes Teague . Mederer certainly knows this as well as anyone , and he tests the coefficient of friction by attaching a fish scale to a spare tire and dragging it with a child sitting in it for weight . It 's been a wet year , and the salt is marginal at best . After the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still mush , and the short course is full of holes that must be filled and scraped . Several cars attempt a run on the short course , but spin out after the first mile or so . The short course makes 300 mph even more difficult , but the Mazda has enough power if the traction holds . Unfortunately , it does n't . The car accelerates off the line and disappears in the distance . A few minutes later the radio announces there has been a crash , but that Mederer has emerged unhurt from the wreck . A videotape demonstrates the fundamental difference between aerodynamic theory and practice . At about 230 mph , the Mazda loses traction at the rear wheels , angles sideways , and then actually rises into the air  --  apparently lifted by the air-flow over the rounded shape of the body  --  before landing on the roof , an unpredictable aerodynamic aberration . Despite the damage , the car is repairable , and Mederer vows he will return . As will the rest of the carnival , hoping for a dry track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a record . The speed and salt are an addictive mixture , the speed records at Bonneville a kind of frontier that grabs the imagination but somehow still seems within reach of logger R. B. John Slagle of Grants Pass , Ore . Slagle is just climbing down from the cab of a 1948 International Harvester truck that once ran the mountain grades , a body selected because of its narrow , aerodynamic cab . He has replaced the original power plant with a 1,472-cubic-inch V16 diesel engine mounted behind the cab , to which he has added two superchargers and two turbochargers . The huge engine pushes Slagle 's ancient truck to well over 200 mph before both front tires blow out , dropping the nose to two steel skis under the front wheels as it slides to a halt . " You know , to someone who loves engines , this is Carnegie Hall , " he says . TRIPPING THE SALT ELECTRIC There may be no place but Speed Week at Bonneville where an eight-ton electric car with a flaming Unicorn painted on the side gets lost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saturo Sugiyama , who has calculated that the power of the 600-hp electric motor used in the Japanese Shinkansen " bullet train " is sufficient to propel him to the electric-car land speed record . Going for a land speed record in an electric car is n't quite as preposterous as it seems . The first five land speed records were held by electric cars , including the first acknowledged attempt at streamlining when the French torpedo-shaped La Jamais Contente ( Never Satisfied ) became the first car to go a mile a minute in 1899 . More recently , the Lead Sled , sponsored by Ford 's Autolight Division , did 138 mph at Bonneville in 1968 . The Clean Liner is the first Japanese streamliner at Bonneville of any kind . It was conceived by Sugiyama , owner of a Tokyo racing shop called Mad House Engineering . Sugiyama says he has been fascinated by the high speeds at Bonneville for years and discovered that sponsorship for the environmentally clean effort was easier to find than for a more conventional  --  and polluting  --  power plant . Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the motor and controller was done by Fuji Electric , manufacturers of the Shinkansen train motor . At full power , the bullet train motor draws 550 amperes of current at 1,400 volts . Current is delivered by a stack of 117 ordinary lead-acid automotive batteries . The low-tech power supply tests as more than adequate , providing in excess of 600 amperes for sustained periods . That 's long enough to last for the estimated four-minute one-way run , after which a second fully charged pack will be installed for the return . The latter would be no small feat  --  manhandling thousands of pounds of batteries in time to make the second run . Old Bonneville hands viewing the car as it was unloaded remained skeptical , not so much because of the power , but because the high torque of the electric motor would be difficult to control on the salt . Another question mark was the suspension , which had been locked solid after the weight of the batteries overloaded the original built-in compliance . Still , Sugiyama was at least hopeful of earning a 200-mph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clean Liner were calculated as capable of something close to 300 mph . The electric power also added an unknown element : The possibility of electrifying the chassis in the event of a crash . As a precaution , Sugiyama insisted that only his brother be allowed to approach the car in the event of a wreck . It was n't the calculated risks , but a flash storm that short-circuited the Clean Liner . The wind ripped Sugiyama 's elaborate tent , and the resulting flood left the electric car stranded in several inches of conductive salt water . After a day and a half , when most of the water had been cleaned up , the salt-corroded electrical connections between the batteries still seemed unsalvageable . After struggling day and night , the car seemed drivable , and the crew pushed it to the starting line . After traveling a few feet , however , the car lost power . The last chance at a run , in the waning hours of the final day of Speed Week , was also aborted . <p>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
