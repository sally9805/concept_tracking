Section : THE CULTURE WARS <p> It was not much noted , or indeed noted at all , that the Million Man March in Washington last November took place in front of what was described in the 1937 Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) guide to Washington as the " the largest and most costly piece of statuary in Washington . " This is the Grant Memorial , the major monument in Washington to the Civil War . It is 252 feet long . <p> Bronze groups of Union Cavalry and Artillery in action at either end of the long granite base are set off by couchant bronze lions around the central pedestal . On the pedestal is an equestrian bronze of General Grant , the second largest equestrian statue in the world , topped only 5 inches by the colossal effigy of Victor Emanuel in Rome . . . . The monument was unveiled in 1922 , on the centenary of Grant 's birth . <p> I am quoting from the guidebook of 1937 , only 15 years after the monument was unveiled . <p> The difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of monuments may be only 15 years by the calendar ; it is more like a century when we consider the two moments from the point of view of artistic tendencies and public and elite responses to them . Considering monuments , 1922 was still in the nineteenth century , 1937 already on the threshold of modernity . It was possibly already too late for the mass of realistic sculpture that makes up the Grant Memorial when it was completed in 1922 . Modernism in art and architecture , in all its forms , was already in the ascendant in Europe . These attitudes were spreading to the United States in the 1930s . The distaste for the kind of monument represented by the Grant Memorial could already be read between the lines of the 1937 WPA guidebook . The WPA itself , which produced the huge guidebook to Washington , has given its name to the last burst of figurative sculpture and painting in the United States , and to the last period in which public buildings accepted decoration and figurative art as an organic , legitimate , integrated part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already on its way out , as we can see in the decoration of public buildings being constructed during the depression . Human figures were already stripped down and flattened , a last way station on the road to their almost complete exclusion from the repertoire of major modern sculptors . <p> These last echoes of figurative art , the art that was once an unchallenged norm for public commemoration , were influenced by Art Deco , which was a purely artistic and decorative tendency , but they were equally influenced by the political movements of the time . In the United States , in WPA murals and the bas-reliefs decorating public buildings , we represented men and women engaged in useful pursuits ; in Russia , they celebrated heroic proletarians ; in Nazi Germany , it was muscular and healthy youth representing a national revival . The buildings such figures graced were erected by very different political regimes , but , whether they were built by the New Deal , Italian Fascism , Soviet Russia , or German National Socialism , there was , embarrassingly , a strong family resemblance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched across the front of public buildings with stripped-down columns or pilasters in the capitals of very different regimes . <p> The traditions represented by the Grant Memorial were not completely exhausted when it was built . It was still possible to do better within these traditions , to build monuments that still speak to us , as the Grant Memorial does not . To read the criticism of the time from the perspective of our own , when almost all figural and classical art is placed in the same passe and outmoded bag , and when memorials and monuments generally consist of blank stone or rusted metal about which not much can be said  --  though critics are hardly silent  --  is an odd experience . Looking backwards from our own age , we are surprised to see how much the critics of the age of figural art could read into the representations of the time , dismissing some , exalting others . <p> At the other end of the Mall sits the much better regarded-then as now  --  Lincoln Memorial . It was , surprisingly , completed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We take a long time in this country getting to our heroes . In contrast , it took no time at all in Communist regimes , from East Germany to North Korea , to erect masses of monuments , undoubtedly because they did n't have to debate the matter , whereas we did . ) Marian Anderson sang in front of this much better known and admired monument at the other end of the Mall in 1939 , and Martin Luther King gave his famous " I have a dream " speech in front of it in 1963 . Why Louis Farrakhan 's Million Man March assembled in front of the now-ignored monument to General and President U.S. Grant I do not know . There seems to be much less going on in the Lincoln Memorial than in the Grant , but that is because we can no longer read the symbols . The Lincoln Memorial is , however , filled with symbolism : the 36 columns represent the states in the union at the time of Lincoln 's death , the 48 stone festoons on the attic above the columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction , the figures in the murals represent variously justice , immortality , unity , fraternity , charity . <p> One thing binds the two monuments , whatever the difference in their quality and their fate in public regard . It was clear what they meant . Monuments were once replete with overt and direct meaning . A hero might rise in the center , holding a document if he were a man of peace , or sitting on a horse if he were a man of war . Around him , depending on the grandeur and expense of the monument , would be arrayed various figures drawn from a repertory with defined meanings . This figure might stand for the defeated enemy , that one for the grateful country . The symbols of war or of peaceful achievement would be properly distributed around the site . Male and female figures might represent the virtues or the vices ; the rivers or the winds ; the seasons or the arts ; the continents or the states or the cities . Inscriptions would grace the pedestals and further elaborate on the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant of the intended meaning of the various figures and emblems and symbols and historical evocations but that hardly affected his enjoyment of , and response to , the monument . He could appreciate the craftsmanship in the decorations , respond to the soldiers , and admire the symbolic ladies in various stages of undress ; the children could climb on pedestals and figures and play in the pools ; and the cognoscenti could distinguish in quality and sophistication the work of one sculptor of the human figure from another . Multiple meanings <p> As we know , things have changed . Long before the sophisticated critics of the present day began to discern in these monuments of the nineteenth and earlier twentieth centuries meanings that we presume were unintended by their sponsors and creators , we began to find this kind of monument , drawing from a received grammar of symbols with specific meanings , unsatisfactory , just as we also turned against classical columns and pediments . Today , in the wake of Marxism , deconstruction , postmodernism , and other contemporary critical movements , it is all too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperialist arrogance , Western cultural hegemony , male chauvinism , homophobia , and on and on  --  so many meanings multiplied by contemporary theory that these monuments are sitting ducks before modern critics . <p> Of course , even without our contemporary exponents of cultural studies reading new unintended and unconscious meanings into our monuments , their meaning changes over time . We erect them for one purpose , and they begin to serve another . Eiffel 's tower was designed to represent the frontier of the science and technology of the time , to speak to the world of France 's preeminence in the arts of engineering ( it was at the time the tallest structure in the world ) . Today , it stands for Paris and French elegance , its mathematically derived curves and arches speaking to us of grace and gayness . One can be sure the great engineer Eiffel had nothing like that in mind . <p> The Statue of Liberty , originally named Liberty Enlightening the World , was intended by its French originators and creators to symbolize the friendship between France and the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty , reaching from the new world across the Atlantic , were in some way to influence the authoritarianism of Louis Napoleon . By the time it was finally completed , more than 20 years after it was first proposed , Louis Napoleon was long gone , France was a republic , and the statue came to mean a welcome to immigrants , a notion scarcely in the mind of Laboulaye who proposed it or Bartholdi who created it . ( And , speaking of diverse meanings , some detect in the Statue of Liberty Bartholdi 's intention , conscious or unconscious , to memorialize his mother . ) <p> The successful monument incorporates symbolic meanings without embarrassment at its origin , and can carry new meanings attributed to it over time without any necessary diminishment . The human figure , the obelisk , the pyramid , the column , ancient forms all , inevitably can carry many meanings and can continue to do so while aesthetic tastes , elite and popular , change . It did not need the new varieties of criticism of our own day to change our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make earlier traditions appear overblown , pompous , extravagant . One could detect the transition even in 1922 when modernism in American arts and design was limited to a few advanced artists . The Lincoln Memorial already represented to some degree the simplification that modernism called for in building and design , even if it did not yet incorporate the antagonism of modernism to classical models and to the direct representation of the human figure . <p> The reduction of meanings  --  intended meaning , communicated meaning , unambiguous meaning  --  in public sculpture and monuments has proceeded apace . In the wake of this change , we have moved from an age in which monuments were filled , indeed overfilled , with meanings , such that they required guidebooks to tell us what each element of decoration symbolized unambiguously , to an age in which monuments and memorials stand mute , even if their creators and sympathetic critics insist they are telling us something . Silent art <p> The mute monument is all around us , and the most successful monument of the last decades  --  the Vietnam Memorial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were added to it , to the dismay of its youthful designer and sophisticated critics  --  symbolizes this muteness . It does not tell us that these men died for their country , or for liberty , or for democracy , or even that they died in vain . It says nothing except that they died . And in view of the ambiguity that surrounds the Vietnam War , this is probably all for the best . The fact that the monument asserts nothing , in contrast to the monuments of the past , undoubtedly helps make possible its universal popularity . <p> But that is only one factor in its popularity , and of course , it is not really mute : It contains the names of those who died , which is the principal reason for its enormous success . These names do more to make it moving to its visitors than any possible inscription or piece of symbolic evocation could . And there is subtle art in its simple form and even in its listing of names . Who was it who decided that the names should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in alphabetical order ? If the decision had been the latter , we would have had a mass of Smiths , Joneses , and other common names , and the alphabetic listing would have depreciated the sense of individual sorrow over each life lost. 1 Nevertheless , one must note that , in contrast with the monuments of the past , there is still very little , nothing but the names . <p> Perhaps there is no better example of the mute memorial than the art works commissioned for the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington . Ellsworth Kelly provides ambiguous white forms . Sol Lewitt provides squares on walls . Richard Serra provides a large square steel plate on a stairway . One can pass all of these without noticing them , and few visitors do notice them . Since they were created for the Holocaust Memorial Museum , one can perhaps think they stand for the muteness that the Holocaust induces in us as one possible , and fully understandable , interpretation . Except that what we see is clearly a Serra , an Ellsworth Kelly , a Sol Lewitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context and the commission in no overt or easily observable way . Their muteness is the muteness of modern art , stripped of historical reference and divorced from any connection to the building in which they are placed and what it memorializes . <p> We should not be unfair to Serra , Kelly , Lewitt . I do not berate them for providing us with simply another example of their trademark work instead of something that responds to the distinctive commission . And indeed , perhaps they did respond to the specific commission in a way that is clear to them and to sophisticated and sympathetic critics even if not to the uninstructed observer . The problem their works present in this context is that of modern art itself , not anything particular to them . If the objects were by the giants of the recent past , Henry Moore , or Alexander Calder , or Pablo Picasso , they would tell us as much , or as little . They would tell us , this is a Moore , this is a Calder , this is a Picasso . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hopes of those who commission works of art to serve a defined purpose . <p> What explains this development , this draining of overt meaning and communication from monuments ? We still build them ; we can do no other when it comes to great events , tragic or heroic , or great figures . While we now have a range of alternatives to the creation of memorials and monuments , great events and great men and women still impose themselves on us . They seem to call for something palpable that remains , that is designed to last for the ages . Such monuments still speak to us as against so-called living memorials , e.g. , a fund to distribute help to the poor or scholarships to the needy or to do good in various other ways . Whatever the monument is , one thing it is not is useful in any obvious way . It symbolizes ; it celebrates ; it mourns . How have we come from the monument that means something , even if time changes that meaning in one or another respect , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply here is the artist and his work ? Cultural confusions <p> Two parallel developments have brought us to this point . One is the complex of changes in the larger culture  --  the confusion of our own times . We no longer know clearly who our heroes are , because none of them come to us without a crippling ambiguity . We no longer know whether we want to celebrate or mourn great events or , if we are clear on that point , how to do so . The second is a more restricted development , that in art itself , but it has powerfully affected our ability to build monuments . The two have come together to bring us to the point where monuments , it seems , can no longer speak to us , and if they did , we would feel they were overdoing it , excessive in their emotion , grandiloquent in their claims , unsuited to an age of coolness and confusion . <p> Concerning the changes in the larger culture , there is little that I can add to what is obvious from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorialize World War II ? In Asia it ended with the atom bomb , but what did that mean ? After the fierce debate over the proposed exhibit at the Air and Space Museum in Washington on the dropping of the bomb , we ended up again with muteness . All we could do was exhibit the plane that dropped the bomb and , then , silence . Not another word : Any would be too controversial . No simple celebration of victory  --  a word that already sounds old-fashioned and is hardly ever used today without quotation marks , actual or implied  --  seems possible today . Charles Krauthammer noted that the official title for the celebrations for the end of the Great Pacific War , as the Japanese call it , was not VJ day ( " Victory over Japan " day )  --  that would have been considered insensitive to the Japanese  --  but " End of the War in the Pacific " day . <p> For the war in Europe , there is apparently less controversy . We are already on the way to creating a monument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting to see what controversies will emerge . I was intrigued to note that the major images to symbolize the end of the war in Europe in the recent burst of television documentaries on the fiftieth anniversary of the victory , paralleling the images of the atom bomb for the end of the war in the Pacific , were those of the horrors of the concentration and extermination camps exposed by the victorious allied forces . No ambiguity there , one would think ; but indeed there is , and not only in Germany , which is reduced to muteness by this monstrous scar on its past . When we come to the complex process of deciding what will memorialize World War II , undoubtedly difficult questions will come up in connection with these overwhelming images of the end . Why did the allies not do more ? When did they know ? What did they suppress ? Do they have the right to celebrate the freeing of the camps when so many millions died in inhuman circumstances , and some undetermined part of those millions could have been saved ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to Ronald Reagan , might look like . Perhaps it 's all to the good that it takes us 50 years at least before we get to memorializing our heroes . ( It took longer for Washington , Jefferson , and Lincoln . ) Even with Franklin D. Roosevelt , who raises fewer divisive questions about just what it is we have to celebrate than do our more recent presidents , it has taken 50 years , and many designs , to find something we could agree on  --  and we are not fully agreed yet on how he will be represented , even though the monument is already under construction . In addition to the landscaped site , there will be a statue . But how will Roosevelt be represented ? What about the ever-present cigarette in its elegant holder ? Or the wheelchair ? The anti-tobacco lobby would insist that the cigarette be suppressed , the disabled lobby that the wheelchair be displayed . If we respond to the pressures of the present day , what was part of Roosevelt 's image in his time will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have photographed will be made visible . <p> We can attribute our ever-increasing difficulties in dealing with heroes unambiguously to many causes . The rise of the ever more intrusive mass media , vigorously exposing feet of clay , is clearly one . Another is the rise to prominence , and some measure of power , of new interest groups that view heroes from distinctive perspectives that were once not much evident in public life and of which it was unnecessary to take account . Today , the perspectives of one or another minority , or women , or the disabled , or environmentalists , and so on , must be reckoned with . And few heroes escape unscathed from the examination of these groups . Trivial pursuits <p> The arts of publicity and entertainment and media exploitation can , and to some extent do , enlarge heroes , if only briefly . But they play a more significant role in diminishing heroes in the public eye . They also compete directly with heroes and their monuments , providing something more accessible , less demanding , more fun . Travel agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington ; they seem to prefer Disneyland and Disneyworld or Las Vegas and Atlantic City . High-school students no longer see Washington , Jefferson , and Lincoln on their classroom walls and seem to be equally happy to skip seeing their memorials on their high-school trips . There are apparently more amusing sites than Washington . <p> In Boston , the marked trail that guides the tourist through the city 's many historic revolutionary sites  --  Faneuil Hall , the Old North Church , the house of Paul Revere  --  finds stiff competition today in a Bugs Bunny statue and a huge Teddy Bear in front of the F.A.O . Schwarz toy store . It is with such statues that tourists want to pose for photographs , rather than with the many worthies to whom statues have been erected . ( I note that John Harvard still draws as many tourists as ever for posing and photographing , but I think that is because it is camp  --  no one thinks John Harvard was a real character . ) It is all part of a piece with the decline of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more amusing things to do . <p> In the past , we found it possible to build for a distant future because we believed the future would be an extrapolation of the present , without violent and cataclysmic breaks . We do n't believe that any more , and our buildings change in response. 2 Pennsylvania Station may have been built as solid as the baths of Caracalla on which it was based . It was with great effort demolished after serving for only 50 years . Huge buildings become evanescent . They may lose half of their value before they are completed and may already be candidates for demolition at their completion because there is no economic return on their investment . And , in any case , they are commonly made of glass and steel and aluminum rather than stone and masonry and brick  --  they look as if they could be taken apart with a screwdriver . So what place is there for monuments designed for the ages ? <p> I note in the newspapers rising complaints about the grandest federal building that has been erected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete the Federal Triangle , a building that is exceeded in size only by the Pentagon . I can not even refer to it by name . It does n't have one yet because of the uncertainty that has existed since it was begun over what it will be used for . It has had a number of intended uses since it was conceived , but some of the agencies it might have housed may not exist by the time it is finished . So it has no name yet , neither one that might characterize its principal function  --  it was originally intended to be a World Trade Center and house agencies dealing with world trade  --  nor the name of a public figure that might capture its spirit . Senator Moynihan and Senator Dole together have proposed that the building be named after Ronald Reagan , which may make a reluctant Congress more willing to properly complete and equip it . But I read in a newspaper : " If you name a white elephant after Ronald Reagan , will conservatives in Congress buy it ? " <p> Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any interest at all in the physical form of our capital . Since arriving in Washington 35 years ago , he has been concerned with the rebuilding of Pennsylvania Avenue , the once tacky street along which presidents drive to their inauguration , and he helped create the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Commission . When he wrote the bill authorizing the building , he called for one of " monumental quality " that would " provide visual testimony to the dignity , enterprise and vigor of the federal government . " It was once taken for granted that this was what important federal buildings should do , as one can see if one visits any federal courthouse built before World War II . It is hard to believe our nation is poorer than it was when it built those magnificent structures , clearly designed for the ages . But any building that tries to realize that ambition  --  " to provide visual testimony to the dignity , enterprise and vigor of the federal government "  --  today immediately comes under attack . For artists only <p> No time for monuments , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture undermines the attitudes of respect , reverence , and awe that would support the building of monuments , that would appreciate them , that would use them . That might be enough to settle the matter . <p> But then , aside from what has happened to our culture , to our society , to the world , there is what has happened to art . We need the artist to build our monuments  --  the sculptor , preeminently , but also the architect , the designer , and the painter . The works of the preeminent artists of our time do not lend themselves to the functions of commemoration , memorialization , and communication of meanings , except for the meaning that the work has for the artist himself or perhaps for the history of art itself . " Self-referential " has become the popular term for contemporary art and architecture , but the reference in question is available only to experts and specialists and may make no sense and hold no interest for those who are not . <p> Art , as we all know , has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint , color , form , and the canvas itself ; the sculptor with his materials , stone , metal , and wood ; and , now , both are intrigued by newer materials , such as plastics , neon lights , and video and computerized images . The most publicized artists of the day go on to even odder materials , such as meat spread over a human figure or chocolate cakes mashed into mattresses . ( The first is part of the permanent exhibit of the Walker Memorial in Minneapolis , and the second was featured in the last Whitney Biennial show . ) All this is as far a cry from Ozymandias as one can imagine . <p> It would be easy to caricature this development , and it is tempting to do so . No one has been better at it than Tom Wolfe . If I had to vote , I would be on his side rather than on the side of the artists who have resolutely removed readily available sense and meaning from their work , or the critics who have encouraged them , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important and instruct hordes of art history students on their significance . The artists who use human figures and who try to tell the story of the events they memorialize are clearly on the defensive today in the world of art  --  among art critics , in art history departments , in peer groups that commission major works . They are plaintive in defending themselves , for they know that they are on the losing side : They are inevitably linked to past traditions in the face of the onslaught of the new . <p> Nathan Rapoport , a Polish Jewish sculptor who spent the war years in the Soviet Union and who returned to Poland to design the Warsaw Ghetto memorial , said , in defense of his work  --  which is , with its human figures in despair and in triumph , reminiscent of the Soviet style or perhaps of the WPA style  --  " Could I have made a rock with a hole in it and said , ' Voila ! The heroism of the Jewish people ? ' " Nine out of 10 art critics today would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stone with a hole in it . That was the answer of those who commissioned the art for the Holocaust Museum , who were nothing if not sophisticated in matters of art . <p> Is this tendency of reducing artistic meaning to meaning only for artists purely a matter of fad and fashion ? One suspects that there is something deeper motivating it . Those same tendencies in modern society that make it hard to commemorate unambiguously great figures or great events make it equally hard to resort to the artistic traditions of the past without irony or mockery . I find it hard to stand resolutely against the massed voices of art critics and artists and commissioning bodies that would have to be hit over the head to go back to human figures . Sometimes they are hit over the head by what they conceive of as an ignorant public . And so , the three soldiers by Frederick Hart are added to Maya Lin 's mute wall of names . And the original winning proposal for the Korean War Memorial is taken over and radically modified by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central image . The journal of the American Institute of Architects , Architecture , disapproves of the changes in the Korean war memorial . " Compromised Commemoration " is the title of its disapproving editorial . The AIA is no body of radical architects and art critics . But it does not approve of how the original winning proposal has been humanized and made more accessible . Rebel without a cause <p> The artist has been in rebellion against society for almost two centuries , and now the rebellion has extended to the point of victory , or perhaps temporary victory , if not in society generally then in the sphere of art itself . The art that represents the tradition of rebellion attracts far more attention and approval in the world of art than any work of art that represents acceptance of artistic traditions , of classic artistic materials , of the notion that one aim of art is to please a patron . Art is gripped by the " tradition of the new . " The avant-garde of outrage and shock is institutionalized to the point where it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to be a rebel . A recent book on contemporary public sculpture begins with a sentence the author does not consider remarkable but which I do : " The problems endemic to public art in a democracy begin with its definition . How can something be both ( public ) democratic and art ( elitist ) ? " Harriet Senie , who writes this in Contemporary Public Sculpture , assumes that art by its nature must be elitist and dismisses in so doing nine-tenths of the history of art . <p> I have described a trajectory in the making of monuments from meaning to muteness . Perhaps there was too much overt and intended meaning in the monuments of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . It would certainly appear so from our present perspective , which prefers the spare , the minimal , the stripped-down image . Indeed , the monument may be no longer a representation of an image at all but simply a representation of the materials that were once used to make images . So we come to the mute , the nonspeaking monument . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monument or memorial at the beginning , but its taste too has been educated . Now it tolerates this muteness , and , when associated as the Vietnam Memorial is with a tragic and , in many minds , meaningless war , it will actively respond to and appreciate it . Art and nihilism <p> But that is not the end of the line . There is the mocking monument and the anti-monument . The artist is no longer silent in the face of his commission ; in fact , he undermines it or subverts it . The monument then is no longer silent : It becomes a critique of what it was intended to celebrate or memorialize . I prefer the subversion of humor to grimly serious subversion , in which the artist attacks his patrons and his audience and makes himself a critic of the society whose representatives have commissioned his work . The master of the mocking monument is Claes Oldenburg . On the cover of the dust-jacket of the book Contemporary Public Sculpture , to which I have already referred , is a picture of Philadelphia City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in front of it , huge and almost dwarfing the building , is an enormous black clothespin . One has to at least smile . I assume the clothespin is not permanent. 3 If it were , the monument would lose its point and its humor . A giant clothespin ( or any of the other objects of very ordinary life that Oldenburg blows up to monster size ) is not intended for the ages . <p> The nonhumorous subversive monument is another matter . The artist begins to take himself too seriously and regards with contempt the needs , desires , and hopes of those who commission his art . So , when Richard Serra was asked to provide a sculpture for a square in New York City surrounded by a federal courthouse , a federal office building , and other public buildings , he put up a tilting wall of steel , slashing diagonally across the square . One could not sit on the wall , which , in tilting , seemed to threaten falling on passers-by , and which made uncomfortable or impossible the everyday use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place to lunch or to enjoy the out-of-doors . This sculpture went beyond muteness to offensiveness , and some of Serra 's comments suggest that this is what he intended . ( The term " subversion " is common in current appreciations of advanced art , and here it would appear Serra hoped to " subvert the context . " 4 ) <p> The General Services Administration , which had commissioned and paid for the work on the advice of a distinguished panel , held hearings to determine whether the sculpture should be removed . The art world fought vigorously against the removal of this obstruction . It was the kind of clash that Harriet Senie had in mind in contrasting art as an elite activity and the public as the voice of democracy . Against the advice and impassioned resistance of scores of art critics , the wall was removed . This event is viewed by the art world as a triumph of philistinism , but such victories of uninformed public opinion are rare , and its rarity is a demonstration of the intimidating power of contemporary artistic opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebels against the monumental tradition and possibly tries to criticize ( " deconstruct " ? ) the hopes and intentions of those who have commissioned the work , is the most characteristic monument of our time . A lead-plated , 39-foot column in Hamburg was constructed as a monument to the Holocaust . It is designed to sink , a few feet at a time , into the earth until it disappears . People are supposed to write observations on it . But what will they write when there is nothing on the monument that explains what it is for ? Another Holocaust monument in Austria is meant to recall a fountain given to the town by a Jew and destroyed by the Nazis . The monument is a recreation of the original , but this time as its hollowed out interior , dug into the ground . And there are other ingenious examples of the anti-monument , particularly out of Germany . This makes sense : Germans have the hardest time , hard as it is for any of us , in figuring out how to memorialize the Holocaust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Just what the anti-monument is against is often not easy to divine : It may be the monumental tradition itself ; or the society and authorities who innocently want to celebrate or memorialize something ; or popular attitudes to what is being celebrated or remembered . A huge mountain of shopping carts erected around and completely covering a Mozart statue in Salzburg was , one assumes , not intended to subvert Mozart but rather his commercialization . The citizens of Salzburg did not sense this distinction and demanded the dismantling of the shopping-cart tower immediately . <p> But the anti-monument is of course more than a German phenomenon . We deal with the problem of modern art itself , whose mission of showing its contempt for bourgeois society now requires ever more outrageous acts and objects . And so , for example , sputtering denunciatory slogans is a popular new approach to making art out of unlikely materials . The artist versus the people <p> When it comes to the anti-monument , it is quite proper for the commissioning authorities to say to the experts who have selected the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " Undoubtedly , we will have responses that are insensitive to the power of some contemporary images and to the range of meanings even a mute monument may carry . This was true of those who objected to the Vietnam War Memorial with its black granite and absence of human figures or any ennobling inscription . It turned out that , once the memorial was built , the public disagreed . They found a great deal in it . It became the most popular monument in Washington . <p> But it is also true that the public processes that must inevitably come into play when we build monuments in a democracy produced an addition to the monument in the form of a group of human figures , representing the soldiers who fought in that ill-fated war . I do n't think that bothers any of the many thousands who go to that memorial , despite the tuttuting of the arts community . Nor do I find that group of human figures objectionable . One may consider them , even in purely aesthetic terms , as balancing the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York World 's Fair of 1939 presented contrasting , but balancing , objects . I also think that the later addition of more human figures was too much , and any more  --  and varied interest groups keep on proposing yet additional clumps of human figures  --  would just be silly . But that is my opinion . <p> In the present age of discordance , there is really no way of settling these matters aesthetically . The authoritative voices in the world of art will almost uniformly prefer the new , even if mystifying or outrageous . Popular opinion will almost always be doubtful . These matters do get settled , but by means of politics not aesthetic authority . In the present situation , this is , I think , all for the best . We should not accept the authority of the art community without demur or the voice of the people as the voice of God . The two will inevitably conflict , and the conflicts will be settled in a messy way . Looking at the results of some of these conflicts  --  such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first group of soldiers to the Vietnam Memorial  --  I conclude that there are better ways of getting satisfactory public art than resigning ourselves to taking the voice of the contemporary artist and his supporters as the voice of God . <p> This paper was originally prepared for the Boston University Conversazione , " Monuments for an Age Without Heroes , " November 3 , 1995 . This is an even more severe problem in the case of the proposal to list the names of the six million Jews who died in the Holocaust in a memorial being considered for Berlin . Alternatives will have to be sought . It is not possible to know when each died , and the enormous lists of common Jewish names would make the enterprise ridiculous . The new Holocaust memorial in Boston records six million random numbers on its glass columns . The unpredictability of the future has also contributed to the declining popularity of monuments for our families and ourselves ; I refer to gravestones , which are called monuments by those who make them , and the larger constructions that once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Gill documents in this issue of The Public Interest , increasingly favor cremation rather than burial , and cremation requires no monument . Though Witold Rybezynski has told me , to my dismay , that it is indeed permanent . See Nathan Glazer , " Subverting the Context , " The Public Interest , Number 109 , Fall 1992 . <p> By NATHAN GLAZER <p>
