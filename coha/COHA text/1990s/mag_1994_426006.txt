HOW TO TREAT A PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDER . <p> " Happiness can not be pursued ; it must ensue , " I once counseled my then-adolescent daughter , Susie . I was quoting the **25;457;TOOLONG Victor Frankl . Susie countered that she could n't " buy into " this point of view ; it was buying into passivity . I rejoined with a quote from Hawthorne , which was , as I recollected : " Happiness is like a butterfly , which , if you chase after it , will elude you . If , however , you sit quietly and wait , it will come and light upon your shoulder . " Susie suggested a butterfly net  --  an argument that had a certain undeniable merit . <p> I had to concede that the Constitution  --  which grants us the " right to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness "  --  was more in line with my daughter 's activist point of view . Still , throughout our entire windy , angst-ridden discussion , the two of us remained riveted upon the issue of pursuing happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of whether happiness is a desirable state when one achieves it . <p> At the time of the aforementioned conversation , neither I nor anyone I knew had ever considered whether happiness is a good thing or a bad thing . Recently , however , a flurry of academic articles has suggested that happiness may not only be highly abnormal , but , in certain instances , hazardous to a person 's health and career . <p> Granted , this way of thinking about happiness does seem counterintuitive . But , although the current scholarly arguments are abstract and difficult to paraphrase , I shall try to touch upon the major points in this brief space . In a Journal of Medical Ethics article titled , " A Proposal to Classify Happiness as a Psychiatric Disorder , " Liverpool University psychologist Richard P. Bentall argues that the so-called syndrome of happiness is a diagnosable mood disturbance that should be included in standard taxonomies of mental illness such as the American Psychiatric Association 's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual . Happiness , as Bentall states in his abstract , is " statistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is associated with a range of cognitive abnormalities and probably reflects the abnormal functioning of the central nervous system . " ( In this regard , as Bentall later notes , happiness resembles other psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia . ) <p> Although what is meant by " happiness " has never been specified , it seems likely , as Bentall observes , that the condition has " affective , cognitive and behavioral components . " The state is usually characterized by recognizable symptoms such as " positive mood , sometimes described as elation ' or joy ' or in its milder manifestations contentment . ' " The behavioral components associated with happiness are , says Bentall , " less easily characterized but particular facial expressions such as smiling ' have been noted .... Certain kinds of social behavior have also been reported to accompany happiness , including a high frequency of recreational interpersonal contacts , and pro-social actions toward others identified as less happy . " These tendencies , he adds in the essay 's only sour note , may help to explain one of the most debilitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their condition on their unhappier companions . <p> What is the frequency of happiness ? Controlled research on the subject is scarce and inconclusive . But , as Bentall argues , uncontrolled observations , such as those found in plays , novels and soap operas , indicate " that happiness is a relatively rare phenomenon . " A good amount of data of other kinds ( such as informal surveys of one 's acquaintances ) also gives credibility to Bentall 's suggestion that episodes of happiness occur infrequently , and are often of markedly brief duration . <p> What are the causes of happiness ? Little is known about its etiology , Bentall informs us , although some risk factors for happiness have been identified ( individuals in the higher socioeconomic groupings report more positive affect ) . Despite sparse scientific data , evidence indicates that both environmental and biological factors are involved . " With respect to the environment , there seems little doubt that discrete episodes of happiness typically follow positive life-events , " the psychologist explains . " However , the observation that some people are generally happier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inborn and hereditary  --  " factors may also play an important role . " <p> According to Bentall , one of the most intractable happiness-related problems is its clear-cut association with expansive , celebratory behaviors  --  eating too much , drinking too much , behaving too impulsively . Overeating and overimbibing correspond with increased health risks , while impetuousness can place a person in dangerous situations . Happiness also may lead to a variety of more mundane and yet far from trivial dysfunctions , as Bentall observes . <p> Happiness is often related to discernible cognitive abnormalities ; happy people regularly exhibit an array of cognitive distortions and deficits . It has been shown that happy people , in comparison with miserable or depressed people , have difficulty retrieving negative events from long-term memory . Bentall also cites " consistent evidence that happy people overestimate their control over environmental events ( often to the point of perceiving completely random events as subject to their will ) , give unrealistically positive evaluations of their own achievements , believe others share their unrealistic opinions about themselves . " <p> While happiness has , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal diagnostic criteria describing the condition are currently available  --  all evidence strongly suggests that happy people experience a sense of satisfaction in " specific areas of life such as relationships and work , and also in terms of the happy person 's belief in his or her own competence and self-efficacy . " In this respect , Bentall suggests , individuals suffering from the syndrome of happiness are often out of contact with reality and therefore at a tangible social and biological disadvantage . Bentall proposes that the term " happiness " be removed from future editions of the major diagnostic manuals , to be replaced by the formal description " Major Affective Disorder , Pleasant Type . " <p> Bentall 's focus on the " syndrome of happiness " is primarily diagnostic ; but in an article on a related topic , Queens College sociologist Fred H. Goldner discusses the potentially devastating social consequences that being too happy by half may set into motion . Goldner 's essay " Pronoia " appeared in Social Problems : Official Journal of the Society for the Study of Social Problems . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hopes ) belief that people are saying horrible things behind one 's back . The pronoia sufferer has the opposite problem ; this condition , as Goldner defines it , is marked by " the delusion that others think well of one . " The pronoid is possessed by the unswerving belief that anyone who talks behind his or her back is saying the most wonderful , supportive things possible . <p> According to Goldner , pronoids live in a dangerously rose-tinted universe , one in which " mere acquaintances are seen as close friends . Politeness and the exchange of pleasantries are interpreted as expressions of deep attachments and the promise of future support . " These people feel so good about themselves that they tend to be oblivious to negative feedback . In an occupational setting , as Goldner points out , this can lead to fatal mistakes . He notes one typical case : <p> John White ... had been discharged from a well-paying corporate position . He wrote a memo to the president suggesting how the president should respond to inquiries about him from search firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell others that Jones had resigned and not been fired , he then listed in the memo his major strengths that could be praised to a prospective employer . Among them were : " ability to manage large projects and provide directions " ; his " excellent interpersonal skills , particularly in bringing together disparate people to achieve common goals , particularly since people trust me " ; and his being " a self-starter with little/no need for direction once goals have been set . I do n't need to run to my boss on everything . " He could not have put together a more accurate list of the weaknesses that led to his discharge . The president did not respond to the memo , nor had he disagreed with Jones in their last meeting when Jones praised himself . There was really no need to do so , because Jones was leaving and it would have been unpleasant to try to correct Jones 's misimpressions . This silence encouraged Jones to believe that his former bosses thought highly of his capabilities  --  even though they fired him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company had raised no overt objections to the employee 's self-directed accolades as evidence that the pair of them were in complete agreement ( even though he was being dismissed ) . As Goldner notes , such positive delusions are fueled by the natural reluctance of colleagues and bosses to speak frankly to him , and tell it like it is . The pronoid interprets the courteous silences of others as evidence that everyone around him is full of admiration and in complete accord with whatever positions he takes . His blinders allow him to perceive nothing but the good will with which he believes himself to be surrounded . <p> Like paranoia , pronoia can be thought of as an individual 's strategy for simplifying our increasingly complex and ambiguous social environment . We find ourselves in organizations in which , as Goldner observes , " our occupational tasks do not produce quantifiable or easily measured outputs . The more uncertain the criteria , the less the consensus and objectivity  --  and the more dependent we are on the guesses about where we stand in the eyes of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate , the greater the likelihood that neuroses about these relationships will develop . " <p> The pronoid 's neurosis has to do with the belief that he is indispensable to his superiors , adored by his colleagues and performing brilliantly on the job , while the paranoid 's neurosis has to do with delusions that everyone around him is engaged in a conspiracy against him , with the fundamental goal of bringing him down . The pronoid lives in a world that is too good to be true , while the paranoid lives in a world fraught with ill will and malevolent intentions . They have both dealt with ambiguity by responding to all social cues in an oversimplified , almost cartoonlike manner . <p> Here is another of Goldner 's gut-wrenching examples : <p> John Brown , a university professor , was applying for tenure . He submitted a long letter from someone in the field as evidence of how well his work was received . In fact , the only positive aspects of the letter were the opening expression of interest and a closing sentence saying that Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the letter writer informed . The rest of the letter was a devastating critique of Brown 's book . Brown harmed his own cause because he could only see the expressions of interest as positive reactions which then blinded him from seeing the negative content . As confirmed by a phone call , the opening and closing remarks were but the kind of attempts of a colleague to soften the blow of criticism . <p> The reader will perhaps have noted that in both accounts of pronoid behavior , the first name of the major player was " John . " This is true of every one of Goldner 's examples . " All of the pseudonyms I have chosen are John because all of the individuals I observed were men , " he explains . " I do not know whether this was a coincidence , or whether pronoia is especially prevalent among men  --  though I suspect it is the latter . " <p> If I may inject a personal note , let me say that I am in complete agreement . I say this not out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married to a person whose way of being has a distinctively pronoid flavor . He sees goodwill and honorable intention everywhere . This may sound pleasant and amiable ( it may even arouse envy ) but as a steady diet , it can become taxing . My husband was , for example , the only male in America who believed that Ted Kennedy 's famous party at Chappaquiddick was just an innocent office outing  --  and he held on to that belief well beyond the limits of normal credulity . For a while I felt like Ingrid Bergman in Gaslight , struggling desperately to focus on what facts I knew with certainty and which of my beliefs must surely be real . <p> Another time , we threw a party at which a somewhat plastered guest overturned a punch bowl , which landed in the leek soup ; two couples left with the wrong spouses ; several noisy quarrels broke out ; and the hostess seriously considered leaving and staying with our next-door neighbors ( the company would never have noticed ) . After everyone had finally departed , my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debris , and I opened my mouth . I was going to say something like , " I wish I were dead , " or " Ca n't we move to Alaska ? " when he intervened and said , " Was n't that the best party , ever ? Everyone had a wonderful time . " <p> He 's happy , and sincerely glad to be a pronoid . Or so he says . <p> PHOTO : A Smiley Face ' <p> By Maggie Scarf <p>
