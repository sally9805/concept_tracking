<p> The curator was expecting me . When I told him what material I was looking for , he nodded and said , " Hailstone . " It was the Navy 's codeword for one of its most ambitous operations in the war against the Japanese . " We can bring them right up for you , " he said . <p> The after-action reports were on a roll of microfilm . I sat at the machine and scrolled through the task group designations and operational orders , looking for something familiar . After a while , I found the name of my father 's ship , the Bunker Hill along with the reports of each squadron in his air group . At the end of the first report from bombing squadron 17 , there was the signature that I remembered from all those old report cards , excuses for missing school , and the letters that had come when he was away at sea . It seemed , suddenly , very quiet , even for a library . <p> I spent the day at the microfilm machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were in my baggage , a month later , when I flew across the Pacific by stages that recalled the laborious island-hopping strategy of the war , landing first at Johnston island , Kwajalein ( where my father had also seen action ) , Pohnpei , and , finally , Trek . Those reports were my guidebooks to a sunken battlefield . <p> It was dusk when the plane landed , fully dark by the time I boarded the S.S. Thorfinn , built by Norwegians for whaling and converted by our captain to be a mother ship for salmon fisherman off the coast of British Columbia . This was his second season working her as a live-aboard or divers in the Pacific , a way to keep the ship operational during the months when the salmon are not running . <p> There were about two dozen of us . From Texas , Hawaii , British Columbia , San Francisco and other points . All , needless to say , avid divers willing to cross as many as ten time zones for a trip like this . Of course , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case , the airline had misplaced the luggage belonging to some people from California . It held all their dive gear and cameras rod was somewhere out there in the Pacific Rim , who knows , maybe in the Philippines . We anchored over the closest wreck to the airport in the 200-mile-wide lagoon , and hopefully radioed the airport after each arriving flight . <p> The Thorfinn was well appointed . A large lounge supplied a VCR and a movie library , a rack of old paperbacks , and a bar . The food was ample and very good , especially the lobsters and the sushi , carved from fish fresh out of the water . Best of all , there was a hot tub on the fantail . <p> Being aboard ship eliminated any temptation to go out for idle sightseeing or shopping , which was fine with me . I wanted to study my after-action reports and compare them with the charts on the bridge showing the locations of the known wrecks in the lagoon . <p> There were a lot of them . Truk was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out from my father 's ship and four other carriers in early 1944 were the most audacious to date . After holding on at Guadalcanal , when the U.S. could at one point count only a single operational fighter plane , the tide had turned . Carriers had raided Rabaul . The Marines had taken Tarawa in a bloody assault . My father 's squadron had fought in both those battles and in several other actions . But the raid on Truk would be the big show for his squadron , the opportunity for a major breakthrough . The U.S. Navy hoped to catch the whole Japanese fleet in the anchorage and destroy it in one epic battle . <p> But everything in war is contigent and uncertain , seen through a prism fogged by misinformation , incomplete information , and wishful thinking . " Intelligence failures , " they are called . They happen  --  the same way that airlines lose luggage . When the blue Navy warplanes appeared over Truk Lagoon at dawn , the warships of the Japanese fleet were , for the most part , gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rest of the fleet and tried to make it out of the lagoon . But U.S. ships were waiting , blocking the entrance , and their guns quickly sank the Japanese ships in 300 fathoms . The first U.S. planes over the lagoon attacked several destroyers and sank them there . That left dozens of fat , vulnerable auxiliaries  --  oilers , cargo carriers , and tenders  --  and one of those mysteries of war , which , like the exact location of the battle of Can nae , is never quite resolved . <p> Some of those first planes over the lagoon reported sighting a small carrier . This news was passed on to my father as he prepared to launch and lead his squadron in . <p> There were already ships burning in the lagoon when they arrived looking for targets . Others were zig-zagging and making for the entrance and the dubious safety of the open sea . Anti-aircraft fire thickened as the gunners began to find their range . One of the planes in my father 's section was hit and went down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Even so , my father and the other pilots in his squadron reported sighting a carrier . They attacked and scored several bomb hits . When they left , the ship was burning and making very slow speed . By the time they had landed , refueled , rearmed , and returned to the lagoon , there was no sign of the carrier . It was listed in the intelligence reports as " heavily damaged , possibly sunk . " <p> For a carrier dive bomber pilot to sink an enemy carrier . would be the greatest prize of all . For months , ever since I knew I would be coming to Truk , I 'd dreamed of diving on that carrier . Then , while we were waiting for word on the lost luggage , I learned from the local dive guides that no carrier had ever been discovered in Truk lagoon . In itself this was not necessarily conclusive , since wrecks are still being discovered ; in fact , a destroyer was located for the first time while I was there . But Japanese officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found on the bottom of the lagoon because no carrier had been there during the battle . Several authorities believe that in the heat and confusion of battle , the U.S. pilots must have mistaken a seaplane tender for a carrier . <p> To say I was disappointed to discover , having come halfway around the world , that the object of my quest did not exist would not fairly describe my emotions . <p> But there was still the diving . So early on my first morning , I suited up to swim down onto the Shinkoku Maru , one of the unfortunate auxiliaries that had stayed behind and taken the punishment intended for the Japanese battle fleet . It was an oiler , over 400 feet long and sunk in some 160 feet of water . We were anchored directly over it , and from the Thorfinn 's fantail , I could look down into the brilliant blue water and see the cross bar of its mast , white as bone . <p> I dove the wreck that morning , and swam its length . The old hulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swam around it in large , shifting schools , and it seemed at peace . It was eerily intact and seemed to have sunk whole , as though it had instead died of the nautical equivalent of old age . But near the stern , just forward of the rudder at the engineering levels , there was the ugly hole , big enough to drive a small truck through . It had been made by an aerial torpedo , and when I swam into it , the damage the warhead had done was obvious . The bulkheads had been blown out as if they were made of cardboard . It was a sobering wound . <p> We dove that wreck for two days while we waited for the lost gear to arrive , and in that time I became accustomed to the depth and casually familiar with the wreck . On the second night , I went into the water with only a small flashlight for illumination , and dropped down slowly through the dark , liquid world until I was just over the Shinkoku Maru 's main deck . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes later , several others followed me down , all of them carrying cameras . As they descended on the wreck , they began taking pictures , and their strobes popped like flares at irregular intervals , down the length of the dead ship . I turned off my little light and watched . It could have been another spectral attack , a second bombing to haunt the old ghost . I could hear some kind of faint , steady sound  --  probably caused by the movement of water through the steel cables and railings of the ship  --  that sounded like moaning . <p> I stayed down until my body was saturated with nitrogen , moving very little , watching the light show and the long fingers of the soft corals moving ceaselessly with the current . I was both reluctant and relieved to get away from that dead ship and back to the Thorfinn with its bar , music , and living companions . <p> According to the after-action reports , the Shinkoku Maru was probably sunk by torpedo planes from the U.S.S. Bunker Hill . It was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was not what I had come for . So when the lost gear was finally located , and we pulled up anchor to head for another part of the lagoon and other wrecks , I was doubtful that this trip would pay off in the way I had imagined it . <p> We would be diving three different wrecks from our new location . From my reading of the after-action reports , I was convinced that two of them had almost certainly been sunk by my father 's squadron , the third by planes from another carrier . <p> We dove that third ship  --  a cargo vessel , the Fujikawa Maru  --  first , since it was in relatively shallow water . A few feet of its rusting mast still showed above the surface , and it was only 60 feet down to the bridge . At this depth , enough sunlight reached the wreck to sustain an abundant , dazzling growth of coral , so much that it virtually changed the old hulk from what it was into a startling , solitary reef . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that parted as you approached . One school of sergeant majors must have numbered a thousand . The colors of the fish , especially the blue chromis and the clown fish that hovered over every anemone , were stunningly vivid and tropical , suggesting birds in some lush rain forest . Nothing on the upper decks recalled the violence of war . The wreck had been reclaimed by time and the wild growth of the coral , much the way an old automobile is reclaimed and ornamented by kudzu vines . The Fujikawa Maru had been transformed into something oddly and peacefully beautiful . <p> This changed when you swam a little deeper , into one of the cargo holds , where a Zero fighter rested , virtually intact and largely free of coral . You could actually sit in the cockpit , which seemed like a neat , playful sort of thing to do . <p> The Zero was arguably the best plane produced by any nation in that war . It was never entirely outclassed and provided ample evidence , a half century ago , of the technological capability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zero successfully through good tactics and teamwork , even when their planes were inferior . Later , they cleared the skies of all Japanese planes because they could produce well-trained aviators and solid airplanes by the hundreds and thousands . But none of this was inevitable or ordained the way it now seemed as I sat in the cockpit of the sunken fighter plane . <p> Actually , the decisive American victories  --  Midway and Guadalcanal  --  were won against superior Japanese forces . They had better equipment , more of it , and the experience that came with waging wars of aggression for some ten years before the attack on Pearl Harbor . <p> Those battles had been won by brave men and able commanders  --  if Raymond Spruance were British , he would be remembered as Lord Spruance of Midway , and there would be statues in his likeness all over the country . As it is , not one American in fifty today could tell you who he was . <p> My father had never talked much about what he had done , but I had read about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded in a little wartime book called Helldiver Squadron , written by one of the many able journalists who went out to cover the action . It struck me then , and still does , just how much was riding on the actions of a few men in their twenties . The Navy war in the Pacific was a carrier war and everything depended on the pilots . The pilots in World War I may have been romantic figures , but they did not influence the war in any appreciable way . But at the battle of Midway , the U.S. fleet went in with a couple of hundred carrier pilots who , within the space of five minutes , sank three Japanese carriers , changing the course of the war and , for that matter , history . About half of those pilots were killed . In one squadron , only a single pilot survived . Both the odds and the stakes were intoxicatingly high for those young men . The ships I had seen so far revealed little of this , and hardly any hint of the ferocity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards from where we had anchored was more expressive . Here were bullet-scarred concrete blockhouses and gun emplacements , built by the natives of Truk and by Koreans imported as slave labor . The Japanese were cruel occupiers . And cruel in battle . One American pilot , shot down in the raids , was captured and marched into the jungle where he was tied to a tree and used for bayonet practice . After the war , several Japanese officers stationed at Truk were tried , convicted , and hanged for war crimes . <p> My father said no more to me about any of this than did the old ships sunk by him and the other American pilots . He died when I was still too young for us to talk about those matters , and before I went off to my own war in Southeast Asia . He was a gentle man , for the most part , and exceedingly reserved . He probably told war stories when he was with other pilots , but not around me . <p> Once , not long before he died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early version of the confrontational " discussion " format so popular today . The issue was whether or not the U.S. should have dropped the atom bomb on Japan . <p> I was instinctively persuaded by the guest who argued that we should not have dropped the bomb . After it was over , my father listened calmly to me and with much more respect than I deserved . <p> " Well , " he said , " I ca n't agree with you about that . " <p> I repeated the arguments , very sure of myself , seduced by my own abstract cogency . <p> " I understand all that , " he said finally , " but I had just gotten an air group , and we were headed for the invasion of Japan when they dropped that bomb . Nobody was looking forward to that invasion . Least of all me . " <p> On our sixth and last day in the lagoon , we would be making our most ambitious dive , to 200 feet ; and we would at last be diving on a wreck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father 's targets , the San Francisco Maru , a cargo ship . <p> I felt uncommonly tense when I climbed into the tender . The captain of the Thorfinn was along for the dive , and he reminded us that we could stay down for only ten minutes ; even then we 'd still have to hang off at twenty and ten feet and decompress . We carried extra tanks on a line for that purpose . It was a serious  --  if not dangerous  --  dive and the mood in the tender reflected that . There was not much talking . <p> Our guide was a man named Paussi , a native of Truk , one of the young men who had become a diver probably because it paid so well and offered a life of something other than the idleness of welfare . His parents remembered the battle and the occupation . They still feared and hated the Japanese . Paussi eagerly dove any new wreck that was discovered in the lagoon . The Japanese government paid him to recover the bones of crewmen for proper burial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dive on the destroyer that had just been located . <p> Paussi stood in the bow of the tender , giving hand signals as he picked up his bearings from the beach . When he had them lined up , he dropped the anchor . The line seemed to pay out endlessly . <p> We suited up , reviewed our dive plan one last time , then rolled into the water and started down the line . At nearly 100 feet , I saw a brown smear below me . It was not a shape yet , merely a flaw in the perfection of the water . As I went deeper , the smudge slowly grew into something more precise , a shape that was still indistinct but more than mere bottom . <p> Finally , it became a ship . I looked back up the anchor line , which is something like looking down from the top of a tall building . I felt uncomfortably aware of all those tons of water above me . <p> I seemed to fall , the way you do in a dream , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 20 feet above a very dead ship . <p> It was a clean wreck . No coral and very few schooling fish . A kind of brown algae grew over the steel surfaces , but it was a low , primitive kind of growth that did not soften the hard , engineered angles of the ship 's constuction . The symmetry was still evident , except where the plates had been horribly buckled by the force of a bomb hit . There had been several . This ship had not simply died ; it had been killed . <p> I took in enough air to become neutrally bouyant and floated above those torn sheets of steel . I checked my depth and air . One hundred and seventy feet . Already less than 2500 pounds per square inch . It seemed unnaturally quiet . <p> I swam along the ship , toward the bow . There were a couple of small tanks held on the deck by cables and turnbuckles . Sediment filled the gaps in the treads . The guns looked small , almost puny , but those tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the other islands taken by the Marines later in the war . The raid on Truk had deprived the Japanese of vast quantities of materials and the ship bottoms necessary to move it . <p> I went below 200 feet almost without realizing it . I was studying those tanks and the shell casings that littered the ripped decks with the attention of an archeologist at a promising dig . The ship had been here , on the bottom , for almost half a century . My father had seen it for only a few seconds before he released his bomb and hauled back on the stick , feeling the force of the Gs and then the hard concussion of the explosion behind him . I had a few minutes to look at the same ship . I wanted to impress it as deeply on my memory as he had . <p> Or , perhaps , I was merely a diver seeing something singular and haunting , something that required no history and no personal connection . For whatever reason , I went deeper than I ever had before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush with nitrogen narcosis . I also lost track , momentarily , of everything in the world except that ship . The impotent tanks , the husks from anti-aircraft shells , the tangled cables , the buckled steel plates . that lifeless mosaic touched something vital in me . <p> You are always surprised by how suddenly your bottom time is gone . The ten minutes seemed like only a few seconds . Barely time enough to take one or two lasting mental pictures . We began our ascent and it seemed to last much longer than the dive had . I looked back down once or twice . The old ship was a smudge and then . gone . <p> There were two small sharks at the surface , not far from where the anchor line disappeared into the air . They looked wonderfully alive , agile and predatory , after the dead steel of the wreck . I watched them while I was hanging off . After a few minutes , they swam away . <p> That night , I sat in the hot tub on the fantail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking up at a field of unfamiliar stars , seeing the Southern Cross for the first time in my life , and thinking , not with much precision but with something that seemed better and very much worth the trip , that I had what I 'd come for . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Sunk more than 40 years ago by American warplanes , this Japanese ship is now a spectral reef , haunted by divers . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : An aerial torpedo , its wake still visible , strikes a Japanese ship in Truk Lagoon , February , 1944 . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Lt.

This becomes especially clear when you are at a location such as Truk Lagoon where there are many dive sites , many miles apart . If you live a the beach , in a hotel ( there is one on Truk ) , you will spend a lot of time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dive sites . On a " five-aboard , " such as the S.S. Thorfinn , your quarters move with you from site to site , often at night , while you are reading , enjoying a drink and the hot tub , or sleeping after the day 's exertions . Very efficient and very civilized . <p> The disadvantage of being aboard ship is that . well , you are aboard ship . Which always implies some sacrifice of comfort . Small spaces , machine noises , the smell of fuel . In all , a vague feeling of claustrophobia . On Thorfinn , however , all these negatives have been ameliorated to the point that you hardly notice . <p> It is a big ship  --  170 feet . The 13 double staterooms are large enough to accommodate the divers and their gear . Furthermore , they are reliably air-conditioned , which is no small blessing in the tropics . A reverse osmosis plant provides an ample supply of fresh water . Laundry service is provided . The food is first-rate . Windsurfers are lashed to the main deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large lounge aft , divers can rest on comfortable sofas , use the VCR to view tapes they have made on earlier dives , or stand themselves to a drink at the bar . On the fantail , there is a vending machine that dispenses cold soft drinks and Budweiser and , also , the pice de rsistance  --  the hot tub . Wonderfully hot and soothing after a night dive to 160 feet or more . <p> The Thorfinn is now in Truk all year . Bookings are handled through See &; Sea Travel , 50 Francisco St. , Suite 205 , San Francisco , CA , 94133. 800-462-9739 . The cost per person for one week runs $1,400 . Thorfinn is heavily booked so it would be wise to call well in advance . The wait will be well worth it . <p>
