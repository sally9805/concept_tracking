He had a lure box with him . He said I 'd cursed him . I could n't remember , up till then I 'd never said a thing but : " Yes , sir . " He said he 'd make sure I never spoke against him again . He took some fish line and a hook out of his box and he sewed my mouth shut . That 's why I never could kiss a girl . Because it 's always bleeding where the line went through .

But it 's living under water like this . MAGGOT Yeah . And when you yell , it does n't make a sound . COD Only bubbles . MAGGOT ( Shrugs ) : What do you think about when you 're working the meat ? My hands do this thing called work , but I let my mind go somewhere else . ' Specially when the manager , that Baquin guy , comes to call . He likes to keep us neat , to tighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . ( Beat ) Does that excite you ? Thinking about him touching me against my will ? COD ( Puts his hand out into the air , touching it ) : Feel it ? It 's heatin ' up in here . MAGGOT I do n't mind the heat . COD That 's how it starts . MAGGOT It 's the smell I ca n't get used to . ( Beat ) You 're sweating . COD It 's a hundred degrees in here . Who does n't sweat ? MAGGOT Maybe you 're sick .

Cod sits nearby , huddled in a corner , dejected and alone . The Sausage Man knows Cod is there , and his words are partly a performance for Cod . SAUSAGE MAN What happened to the dream ? Our dream ? I made one sausage , then two , then three . I could live off of two and sell the third as surplus . The dream as simple math . Make more than you need . Sell the excess . With a little extra cash , hire someone to make the sausages for you , while you deal with the papers and the cash . What is unjust about having another human being work for you ? I employed hundreds . I gave them free trimmings . But they bit the hand that fed them . Chomp . Chomp . They did not respect the math . The math of the dream . Myself , I am an innovator . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will always be refuse in this world , so there will always be a place for me . It 's just a matter of time , that 's all . ( Sausage Man nears Cod . ) Tsk , tsk . I should have guessed . Daydreaming again . Wasting precious time . COD I hate it when you send me in as a Scab instead of union ; it takes twice as long to even get them to listen . SAUSAGE MAN A little extra challenge . You 'll manage . You always do . p. 43 COD Oh , leave me alone . Please . SAUSAGE MAN You 're not ill , are you ? ( Feels Cod 's forehead ) You should n't sit on the floor . It 's damp . ( Takes off his jacket and puts it around Cod 's shoulders ) You should take better care of yourself . COD A mollusc . In the ocean . A limpet . That 's what I 'd like to be . SAUSAGE MAN But they 're so small . You might get eaten by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have this endless , tremendous ocean all around , but they stay their entire lives on one rock . And they never move from that rock . And if you try to pull a limpet off its rock , it hangs on . And the harder you pull , the more tightly it hangs on . SAUSAGE MAN How ' bout a walk ? That 'll cheer you up . COD I ca n't even imagine that kind of determination . SAUSAGE MAN Tsk , tsk . That 's not very ambitious . A limpet ? And what would you do then ? Suck at a rock ? For eternity ? COD Yeah . And I 'd be a part of it all . A part of the ocean . I 'd watch the tide go in and out . I 'd eat algae , digest sand , be witness to shipwrecks and sharks . The birth of an octopus . The death of a sea cow . My mate would be a starfish , and we 'd grow old together . We 'd even die . Imagine that ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And after all those years  --  who knows ?  --  maybe I 'd even leave a scratch , some kind of mark on the stone to prove I was there . ( A noise somewhere that startles Cod . He clings to the Sausage Man , frightened . ) What ? What ? Where are we ? p. 44 SAUSAGE MAN ( Holding him ) : Shhh . We 're still here . Shhh . COD ( Still clinging ) : Where ? Where ? SAUSAGE MAN My child , why are you always lost ? You 've got to learn to locate yourself . Listen : this little piggy went to market . This little piggy stayed home . This little piggy  --  COD OK . Stop it . Stop it . I know where we are . But why a slaughterhouse ? ( Looking Sausage Man over ) I preferred you as a Pullman , a Carnegie or a Rockefeller , delving into mines , reeking of money , not meat . SAUSAGE MAN But you complained about the mines . Too much coal dust in the nose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a nasty cough you had . COD Yeah , and we were ready to blow that mountain wide open . The fuse was lit . But you yanked me out just before the explosion . Just in time . SAUSAGE MAN It might have been serious . COD Was it serious ? SAUSAGE MAN Nasty . Sticky . There was a mess to clean up . COD What 's the point if I never get to see things through ? Damn you . p. 45 SAUSAGE MAN That 's it . Get angry ! Tantrums make you hotter quicker . ( Cod turns away . ) Oh , come on now : kiss my forehead , child . ( Beat ) There 's a life 's work in this industry . Martyrs to be made . Reputations to be saved . COD I want something else . Anything . Forget the limpet then . Send me to an island . I 'll rally the coconuts and crabs . I 'll give you a good tussle . Only let me stay . In one place . Whatever the final outcome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I 'll refuse . SAUSAGE MAN It 's your nature to resist . I can count on you . That 's hard to come by in this late century . That sort of certainty . This city needs you . COD No . I need this city . Without you . SAUSAGE MAN ( Holds out his arm for the jacket ) : The jacket , please . It 's the only one I have . ( Cod moves away . ) Come now . I 'm not a very convincing Mr. Fisher without the threads , now am I ? Do you want to be the death of me ? COD ( Sniffing the jacket ) : This jacket stinks . SAUSAGE MAN It 's authentic . Mr. Fisher died in it . p. 46 COD Yeah ? Well , all right then : meat this time it will be ! ( Holds up the jacket ) And how would you like your jacket sliced , sir ? SAUSAGE MAN The sewing 's a triple-stitch . Take a look . Rather fine , is n't it ? COD Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming up . ( Takes a knife from his pocket ) No fat on this one . ( Makes a neat , clean slice through the back of the jacket ) SAUSAGE MAN Now that 's too bad . ( Cod throws the jacket at Sausage Man 's feet . Sausage Man puts it on . The rip down the back is visible . ) Irreparable damage . No sense . COD I beg you . SAUSAGE MAN You 're a fighter , Cod , not a beggar . Get out there and stir , spark , sputter . The laborer against my system ! It 's glorious . It 's heroic . And we have all the time in the world . Do you know what that sounds like ? COD I know what it tastes like . ( Spits on the floor ) Like ashes on my tongue . SAUSAGE MAN Listen . ( Turns his grinder . We hear strange , sad and sensual music ) That 's the music of all the time in the world . Hear how it weeps , how it grieves and longs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must sing forever . Just like you . Dance to it , my child . Dance to your music . ( Cod stands transfixed as Sausage Man slowly turns in a circle , like a figure in a music box , dancing to the music. ) p. 47 p. 48 Act 1 , Scene 12 SCENE TWELVE Baquin , Tuck , Maggot and Roach in Baquin 's office BAQUIN It 's not the taste of our meat we 're selling , but its appearance , its attitude . How the meat is colored , how it shines , how it carries itself with a straight spine , even if it 's boneless . ( To Tuck ) Do n't slouch . Bring me the soap and water . Good . A man wo n't get ahead if he slouches . But what 's really getting the Company image down is smudge , the smudginess of the workers . They are n't laundering their uniforms regularly . TUCK It 's tough keeping a uniform clean down there , sir . BAQUIN One of your jobs is to make sure the work force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent ? Look at the smudges , the wrinkles , the rips in the cloth . TUCK New uniforms were due six months ago . BAQUIN Nonsense . These uniforms are new . I ordered them myself . They simply have n't been cared for . We must cultivate a passion for cleanliness . The problem is that some of us simply lack passion , and passion is a clean impulse , not a dirty one . And where there is passion lacking , dirt will be lurking . ( Beat ) Take off the uniforms , please . ( Maggot and Roach look at each other in disbelief . They do n't move . ) My dear ladies . Those uniforms are Company property and the Company wants to wash its property . Right now . ( Beat ) Take them off . ( The women turn away and begin to unbutton their uniforms . Roach turns to Tuck as she undresses . He turns to leave . Baquin silently stops Maggot 's hand so that she stops undressing . Until she has removed her uniform , Roach does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49 BAQUIN Just a minute , Buck . I might need your help . Give them the soap and water . ( Tuck places the bucket of soap and water between the two women . ) ROACH I can do this in the bathroom . BAQUIN This is private space here . Feel completely at home . TUCK ( Turning to leave again ) : I need to check the pressure gauge on hog box number six , sir . BAQUIN That can wait . Now wash . ( The women do n't wash . ) ( Shouts ) Wash ! ( The women take the sponges and begin to wash . ) That 's right . Get those smudges off . Scrub hard ! Put that whiff of daintiness back in the cloth , restore that Odiferous mundi . That 's Latin for World Odor . The smell of worldliness and cleanliness . And we do need world odor . Order . Do n't you agree , Chuck ? ROACH ( Throws down her sponge ) : We 're finished . BAQUIN ( Looking Maggot over ) : Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't be . ( He takes the sponge from Maggot and gently cleans a spot on her uniform ) What do you think , Maggot ? Is your friend clean ? ( Continues sponging Maggot , slowly nearing , but not quite touching , her breasts ) p. 50 TUCK She 's clean , sir . BAQUIN It 's hard to tell . ( Sets a chair in the center ) Roach , could you help us out ? Please . Step up here so we can see things better ? ( After some moments Roach steps up on the chair . ) Just as I suspected . There 's dirt behind your knees . TUCK But , sir  --  BAQUIN Surely you can see it ? Ca n't you , Maggot ? ( Maggot does not answer but looks away from Roach . ) Exactly . Well put . Smudges are attracted to the backs of knees . Finish the job . TUCK Sir ? BAQUIN Scrub behind her knees . ROACH Go on , Tuck . Follow your orders . ( Tuck kneels before Roach as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sings . ) Every day one more dolla in my hand , slip through my fingers like a grain of sand BAQUIN ( To Tuck ) : Let me see your nails . ROACH ( Sings ) : One day soon don'tcha know , I 'll be freelivin ' in the sun so do n't you worry ' bout me p. 51 BAQUIN A supervisor must keep clean , short nails . ROACH AND TUCK ( Sing ) :  --  O Lord , God hear me callin ' , take my hand BAQUIN Show me your hands . ( Tuck puts his hands in his pockets . ) ROACH AND TUCK ( Sing ) :  --  Won'tcha take me , take me to the promised land BAQUIN ( Shouts ) : I said show me your hands ! ROACH AND TUCK ( Sing ) :  --  O Lord , God hear me callin ' , take my handWon'tcha take me , take me to the promised land . ( Some moments of silence . ) BAQUIN Well , yes . Well . Tuck . I 'm ravished . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their files ready . I 'd like to look them over when I get back . ( Beat ) Would anyone like a cup of tea before they return to work ? ( No response from the workers ; Baquin shrugs and exits. ) p. 52 Act 1 , Scene 13 SCENE THIRTEEN Cod in the men 's changing room . Maggot enters . Cod has his shirt pulled up , and we see bandages around his lower back that he is just finishing adjusting . COD ( Looking over his shoulder ) : Ladies ' changing room is across the hall . MAGGOT What 's the bandage for ? COD ( Pulls down his shirt ) : Slipped on the kill floor . Got a steer horn in my ass . Cracked three ribs . MAGGOT Wait , Just wait . A minute . ( She approaches him . He does not turn around . ) Can I touch your back ? COD I 'd rather you did n't . MAGGOT Oh . COD It 's not that I do n't like you . MAGGOT Sure . COD I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the kind who sticks around . MAGGOT Save it . COD Look , you seem like . An interesting girl . Nice . If I could stay here a while , I would . But it 's not up to me . I 'm out of here , ( Snaps his fingers ) just like that , when he blows the whistle . Could be today . Could be tomorrow , and my time 's up . And I do n't leave a trace . p. 53 MAGGOT I 've heard that before . ( Maggot is hardly listening to Cod . She 's moved closer to him but has n't touched him . Instead , she stands there and from a distance feels the warmth coming from his back . ) I can feel the heat coming off your body like You know , if I died , I think I 'd like to lay my head down on something like you . ( Cod moves away . ) COD Who 's thinking about dying ? MAGGOT We do n't have to think about it . We 're already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then there 's that minute or two , once or twice a year . Once or twice a decade , when you think , maybe this time something is gon na change . MAGGOT Nothing ever changes here . You just break down after so many years , and they sweep you out back with the rest of the scraps . COD Whatever happened to that animal called hope ? MAGGOT First it got stunned , then it got slaughtered . Seems like for years I just wake and work and shit and sleep . It 's a good life . Nothing to disappoint me . ( Beat ) You know , when I was a kid there were only two things I wanted in the world . A V-8 pickup and a boyfriend who 'd let me drive . You would n't think that was a lot to ask for in life , would you ? p. 54 Act 1 , Scene 14 SCENE FOURTEEN Roach and Maggot at the end of the day in the changing room . Roach has her rod and lure box with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting ready for the weekend . MAGGOT The truth is , my uniform was cleaner than yours . ROACH Get your narrow white ass out of my face  --  MAGGOT Yeah ? You look like garbage . You never take your uniform home and bleach the stains out , like I do . ROACH You know what I was thinking when I stood on that chair ? No . You do n't know . You have no idea . MAGGOT What was I supposed to do ? ROACH Not one word . Did n't call my name . Did n't say , I 'm here by your side . Nothing . MAGGOT You did n't do nothing either . Should I 've let him get me like that too ? Then we could 've both played the dog . Oh yeah . That woulda been " right on , sister . " ( Beat ) I could n't have been that kind of friend to anyone . ROACH ( Examines lures while ignoring Maggot ) : Ah , the rapalla . Looks like a knife in the water . MAGGOT I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 55 ROACH Nickname : " Stab in the Back . " ( Holds up another lure ) Double-headed jig . I call her " Old Two-Face-Strikes-Again . " MAGGOT I 'm not making my bills . ROACH ( Holds up another lure ) : Big Eyes : The Zephyr Puppy . Commonly know as : " The Traitor . " MAGGOT I do n't want to sell the truck . Could sell the tires . ROACH Oh , she plays it coy . MAGGOT Goddamn it , I 'm tired . ROACH But she 's got nine silver hooks , nine pretty lies just waiting for you . MAGGOT You do n't know what that 's like . I ca n't even get myself off anymore ' cause my hands start to shake so bad when I go into repetitive motion . ROACH Whoever named it carpal tunnel never had it . Sounds like a fish . MAGGOT I was on probation last summer , remember ? You piss too often , you chew your lunch too slow , your sausages are n't bent the right way . Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off about half a point . Manager said he 'd have to let me go . I said I needed the job . He said how bad . I said bad . He said show me . ( Beat ) I showed him . ( Beat ) Across his desk between two fern plants . ( They are silent some moments. ) p. 56 ROACH I hate ferns . MAGGOT Whatever it was you wanted me to do that day , I just could n't do it . I guess I 'm not who I thought I was . ROACH That makes two of us . MAGGOT You know , when I was a kid I could n't sleep at night , thinking about dying . Now I think about dying the way I fix a bowl of cereal in the morning ; I could take it or leave it . ROACH You remember Mr. Morton ? Our second grade teacher ? You used to get jealous , ' cause he would take me fishing and he would n't ever take you . MAGGOT I remember : teacher 's pet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked it , and sometimes after school he 'd take me down to the stream . He was the first white man who ever treated me like a child likes to be treated . Like I had something special about me that only he could see . ( Beat ) When Mr. Morton cast a good line , his ears would go red . Red as a worm . MAGGOT ( Sings ) : Oh , my love is like a red , red , worm . ROACH They say a worm has seven hearts and that if you break it up in the right places , two or three of the pieces will live . Problem was , I never knew where the hearts were or where to put the hook in . That 's why I mostly use artificials now . ( Casts her rod as if out into the audience and reels it back in ) Twelve-pound line . Eight-pound line . I was using a six-pound line that day and I landed a four-pound smallmouth bass . You remember the picture ? That fish was longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morton and I skinned it right there and cooked it over the fire . I can tell you I was proud that day . And Mr. Morton was proud of me too . He kissed me on the mouth four times , one kiss for each pound of that bass . Have you ever made your teacher that proud of you ? I liked him better than my own father because he took me fishing , and my own father never had time because he was always at the packhouse splittin ' hogs . ( Beat ) Four times . On the mouth . He said he wanted to know what my kind tasted like . ( Beat ) That 's how proud he was . That 's how . Yes . And I closed my eyes , because if a worm has seven hearts it could have eight and I wanted him to know I could take it . And I took it . Right there in the grass beside the stream . ( Beat ) But once it 's cut you never can tell just which parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and start over because all of the parts are moving . All of the parts are trying to live . Funny . How you can look at a body and see nothing but the whole of it . But I know . I know which parts went on and lived and which parts gave up and died . ( Maggot just watches her in silence ) Yeah . I know what it 's like , girl . I just do n't let it lead me . ( Beat ) Damn it . I ought a punch you in the mouth ( Beat ) but it 's the weekend and you and me are going fishing ! p. 57 p. 58 Act 1 , Scene 15 SCENE FIFTEEN Cod and Sausage Man in the empty packhouse , at night .

You think I 'd have had a chance in hell of catching their attention  --  of catching anyone 's attention in the last fifteen decades  --  if I had n't worn this garb ? SAUSAGE MAN Come now . You 've always enjoyed a nice cut pair of trousers . COD Listen to me : she could keep me here . SAUSAGE MAN Ah , yes . The strength of a woman 's love to break an old promise ? I like it . But what are you waiting for ? Why do n't you sweep her up in your arms ? COD Because if I touch what I desire  --  I 'll destroy it . Just one touch and toast . p. 59 SAUSAGE MAN That 's right . You ca n't touch her . Not like that . And do n't you forget it . COD I hate these hands . SAUSAGE MAN You ca n't change the past , Cod .

Keep tossing those dice . COD Then we 'd just walk through that hole to the other side . And from the stink and wreckage of your death , we 'd build something new . SAUSAGE MAN Give it your best shot ! COD But I never get to stay around long enough to see what 's left , do I ? SAUSAGE MAN Do n't be sour . You 're a spark for eternity .

The workers stand with arms raised but they do n't jump . After eight jumps or so Tuck stops . Then Baquin stops . ) Not just your arms , but your feet too .

( Everyone does jumping jacks in unison for some moments . One by one they stop  --  first Roach , then Maggot , then Cod , then Tuck , then Baquin . ) Now take a deep breath . In , and out . In , and out . Well , I feel refreshed . How about the rest of you ? ( No response . The workers stare at him . Baquin exits , then Cod and Maggot . Tuck and Roach are alone. ) p. 62 TUCK It 's Miss Roach , is n't it ? ROACH Miss Lyles . Roach is my first name . TUCK You taught the recorder lessons after work for employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you got your name ? ROACH Little girl gave it to me when I was seven . I collected bugs . The day I met her I only had a roach in my bug box . So she called me Roach . That was Maggot . Maggot calls me Roach . TUCK That 's a name that wo n't get you very far . ROACH It 's not my name that 's holding me back . TUCK And Maggot ? ROACH When I met her she looked whiter than any white kid I 'd ever met . She reminded me of a maggot . The whiteness of maggots . TUCK Yes . I can see how it came to you . White friend . That sounds like a contradiction . ROACH Sometimes it is . TUCK Well , Roach . What do you know about snails ? ( Roach just looks at him . ) Partula affinis . It is the last snail of its kind . This packing Company is going to start a committee to raise funds for a search in the South Pacific . For a mate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll call it the Salvation Nature Alliance Involving Laborers . S-N-A-I-L . SNAIL . ( Beat ) The board 's hot on the idea .

How would you like ham pumper or pickle maker ? ROACH Can we speak off the record ? TUCK Of course . ROACH Last year the Company tried to sell us piano lessons after work . The year before , it was ice skating for management and employees on Sunday afternoons . Free of charge . Well , let me tell you something : we 're at war here . And we will not shake your hand and we will not skate with you and we will not sing Christmas carols with you for the holidays . We have nothing in common , Tuck . Nothing . And it 's a sorry thing when people like you do n't even have to be forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hook , take the spear right in their gut and then wriggle and say they like it . You may be a supervisor , Tuck , but you 're still a nigger , and when he 's through with you , you 'll go out with the rest of the garbage . ( Beat ) I 'll see you there . TUCK How about a smoker ? Top pay bracket . Or a cooker ? You can have your pick . ( Beat ) It 's not a color thing anymore , Miss Roach . It 's a money thing , a class thing . ROACH Yeah . It 's a money thing all right , and I have n't got any . But I have got a class and you , my brother , are not in it . But you might be again one day . Because the color thing never quite rubs off . You know it and I know it . ( He touches her hair , briefly. ) p. 64 TUCK I 'm sorry about the uniforms . It was n't my idea . ROACH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we 'll do some talking . TUCK Frankly , I do n't like snails myself . ROACH Do n't get in our way . p. 65 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO Maggot , Roach and Cod are working in the refrigeration unit among large hanging carcasses , stamping the meat . They all sing together . The song is less celebration than a song of exhaustion and despair . MAGGOT , ROACH AND COD We stick and slit and shackle and headWe snap and trim and pull and scaldWe scale and stun and scrape the meatWe pack it all for you to eat . If there 's a hell it 's as hot as thisStanding all day in the blood and pissWe work in the war zone and the wages we pullAre n't enough to keep a dog 's tit full .

Brandon examines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did . BRANDON Manually , I see . COD Yes . BRANDON Good for you . But you 've folded the edge over . Cutting with a knife like this you 'll pull your back out . Look . It wo n't cut . ( Brandon reaches for Cod 's hand , but Cod pulls back . Brandon rolls up his own sleeve and drags the blade down his arm . It does n't cut him . ) See what I mean ? ( Holds the knife up between them ) The edge of a knife is like a thin piece of hair . If you angle that steel wrong , you 're going to fold the edge over . p. 66 COD I 'll work at it . ( Cod returns to work . ) BRANDON So the Company wo n't talk ? MAGGOT Sent them three proposals . They said no . ROACH And no and no . COD They 'll bring in replacements if we strike again . BRANDON So it 's " we " now , is it ? ( Beat ) I heard about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered to cut knife time in exchange for seniority rights ? ROACH We had to give them something . We 're fucking tired . Half voted to throw in the towel . Next time we vote , it 'll be over . And so will we . BRANDON We 're not going to eat their contract . Ever . Is n't that what we said ? ( Speaks even slower ) See how a few few thousand wa wa watts to the brain can make a fell fellow rea rea rea sonable ? ( Suddenly jumps and does a perfect cartwheel , ends up face to face with Roach , speaking fast , in rhythm ) So . Have you made a decision ' tween makin ' the dipto sip the strawor having a dip on a conewhile I sup with my cupand smile my way up ? MAGGOT We did n't miss you , Brandon . p. 67 Act 2 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE We are back in the workroom with Cod and the Textile Worker . It is the same dream/scene as the prelude . The Textile Worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Roach and Brandon working slowly , in silence . They are not aware of the scene going on around them , though they chant with the woman . TEXTILE WORKER ( Chants ) : Pull the cloth , punch it down , cut three out , and trace . COD Hey ! I 'm talking to you ! TEXTILE WORKER Hurry , hurry , do n't go slow , keep your cheer and grace . COD I know you can hear me . TEXTILE WORKER Pull the cloth , punch it down  --  COD Look at me ! TEXTILE WORKER ( Turns to look at Cod , but looks in another direction away from Cod , as though she sees him elsewhere ) : I am looking at you . I 'm always looking at you . ( Smoke begins to trickle in from a crack in the floor . ) COD No . No . TEXTILE WORKER Yes . Look at your hands . They 're beautiful . ( Holds up her own hands ) Like mine once were . p. 68 COD Ca n't you see what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames . COD Do something ! TEXTILE WORKER All the water in the world ca n't put their fire out . ( Cod drops to his knees and tries to cover the smoke with his hands to keep it from coming in . ) COD There 's no fire . There 's no smoke . Not here . So pull the cloth , punch it down . ( Sausage Man enters with his sausage machine . ) ALL THE WORKERS " Cut three out and trace . " SAUSAGE MAN The doors have been locked . TEXTILE WORKER " Hurry , hurry , do n't be slow  --  " SAUSAGE MAN From the outside . ALL THE WORKERS "  --  keep your cheer and grace . " SAUSAGE MAN To keep track of employees . The fire trucks are on their way . The fireman will say his ladders could only reach the seventh floor . Is this the eighth ? COD Let us out . Open the fucking doors ! SAUSAGE MAN I do n't have the key . I lost it years ago . ( Beat ) It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset yourself ? p. 69 COD ( Turns to the other workers ) : Help me with the doors . We 'll break them down . ( The workers go on working . They ca n't hear him . ) You stupid bastards . SAUSAGE MAN They ca n't hear you . TEXTILE WORKER My hands sweep the cloth like water  --  COD ( To the workers ) : Do you want to die ? TEXTILE WORKER ( Continuing ) :  --  over the keys of a piano . COD Are you just going to stand there and burn ? ( Sausage Man cranks his grinder , and the fire increases . The workers go on working . ) SAUSAGE MAN They wo n't ever be able to hear you . Because you 're always somewhere else , my child . ( Cod sinks down to the floor , the sound of the fire drowning out his voice as he screams : ) COD Is n't anybody out there ! p. 70 Act 2 , Scene 4 SCENE FOUR Tuck is alone on stage in Baquin 's office . The chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , circles it . He slowly gets undressed , then stands on the chair , as Roach did earlier . He stands still for some moments , as though in another place and time . In his mind , he hears Roach singing a line of the song she sang in Baquin 's office . He gets off the chair , picks up his clothes . He tips over the chair with one finger , then casually exits . p. 71 Act 2 , Scene 5 SCENE FIVE Cod and Brandon in the cafeteria . Brandon is seated , engrossed in eating . COD It 's a scandal . BRANDON Make yourself at home . Food 's not that bad . COD OK . Then as food it shall be . BRANDON It is food . COD Not always it is n't . BRANDON What is the " it " we 're talking about here ? COD It 's no longer an " it , " it 's an " is n't . " BRANDON You 're ruining my lunch with your gibberish . Ca n't a man have  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermission ? ( Returns to his food ) COD ( Picking food off Brandon 's plate ) : Not this canned pea , not this frozen carrot , in fact , not even this BRANDON Lumpagravy . COD Right . Not one piece of anything comes into being without us . BRANDON So , what 's new ? p. 72 COD Not even this tray . ( Takes Brandon 's tray ) BRANDON Wait a minute . COD What you see here is dead . BRANDON It 's a pork chop . COD Labor . Dead labor , of past and present . BRANDON Get out of my lunch . ( Cod lifts the tray and balances it between them , then swiftly slams it onto the table , face down . Brandon watches , stunned . ) COD Without the tray , the mashed potatoes slide into the cheesecake , the milk swamps the peas . This is the situation we 're in today . Without the tray , and the tray being the union here , we 're without a world that gives us definition and power . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mashed potatoes  --  ( Grabs up a handful of the squashed food in his hand ) but a handful of slops . And they 'll use us to feed the hogs . BRANDON ( Picks the pork chop out of the mess ) . Voil ! The pork chop 's the enemy , right ? COD You got it . BRANDON What 's the Big Bad Boss doing down here in the mess with the rest of us ? p. 73 COD No , no . The pork chop is the enemy in disguise . The pork chop 's no better off than the peas . The pork chop 's  --  BRANDON The Scab . COD Bingo . ( Brandon eats the pork chop . ) What you see here is deregulation so that workers have no way of protecting their rights . When we make a stink ' cause we 're offered part-time jobs with twelve-hour shifts , big business just ups and moves over the border or across the sea . It 's the sort of unsavory wage situation you see here when your milk and gravy meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were having Jell-O , it would n't have made a whole lot of difference . COD There 's always room for Jell-O , because we 're one of the only industrialized nations where illegal firings and the hiring of Scabs are common practice . BRANDON Those fucking pork chops . ( Cod picks up forks and hands one to Brandon . ) COD We 're back to the Depression . Eat . No . Back to the Victorian age . ( Eats from the table ) Robber Barons are again free to trade  --  eat !  --  over our dying bodies . Everything and nothing has changed . ( Brandon , to his own surprise , eats from the mess as well . ) But guess what ? ( Pounds on the food with a fork ) No matter how many times they pull the tray out from under us , smash , mash and pulverize our communities  --  ( Takes another bite ) We 're still here . p. 74 BRANDON And we 're still eating . COD Right . ( Beat ) You have the cheesecake . ( Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 75 Act 2 , Scene 6 SCENE SIX Cod and Maggot are on break . Cod is checking over his belt tools . MAGGOT A 1965 baby-blue F-100 Ford , long bed , with a V-8 so hot I can blow the pants off the highway in third gear . COD Must be some truck . MAGGOT Yeah . Only it 's sitting in my yard right now with a main seal leak and bad mounts . I 'm doing the bus these days . You a compact man ? COD I know a good truck . MAGGOT Well , you do n't know my truck . I 'm the only one who can drive it , ' cause it 's three on a tree and it sticks in second . COD Fords are temperamental . MAGGOT Yeah . The engine sweats , foams just a little at the edges . The trick is n't in your hand , really ; it 's in your groin . You got to rock your hips at just the right rhythm to lubricate the hitch on that second gear . COD I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your mouth ? Not too tight and when the pressure 's right and just about to blow , you open it up , wide , and shoot across that highway with the windshield shattering over your head like snow and the sun pouring down your throat like water . And there 's no turning back . p. 76 COD Ford , huh ? A person could go to hell for driving a Ford . They 'll put a stick shift up your ass , and the Devil will cruise you all over his Island singing , " Ford gives you better ideas . " All through eternity . MAGGOT Should have figured you were Chevy . COD A ' 58 , V-8 , short bed with chrome hubs , AM radio , four on the floor and no hitch . But not everyone can drive a Chevy . You got to have the proper wrist action or you 'll burn the gears . And if your hands are dry  --  ( Spits in palm ) you wo n't get the grip you need . ( Takes out a screwdriver or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a Chevy 's got to be treated rough . It 's what a Chevy likes , ' cause it 's an immoral engine and it can take it . Slap it some gas in first and , when you have the speed up and the friction between the rubber and the road is sending sparks down your spine  --  ( Cod sticks the screwdriver into the ground or box between Maggot 's legs . This should be done suddenly and should frighten anyone but Maggot . Cod takes hold of the screw-driver as though it were a stick shift between Maggot 's legs. )  --  then fast into second , straight on and hard . ( Moves stick into second ) Now third 's a risk . Third is going down on the engine . But you got to keep up the speed . And speed is n't a motion , it 's a texture . And it 's not dry . No . Speed is wet . Speed is an ocean , and third 's a deep gear , a diver 's gear , only for the brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cause my cylinders need some air , and then down , down  --  ( Moves stick into third , closer to Maggot 's crotch ) and lock into third . ( Some moments of silence. ) p. 77 MAGGOT And what about the last one : fourth gear ? ( Cod unsticks the screwariver and turns away to finish checking his tool belt . ) Hey ! What about fourth gear ? COD I never tell a girl how to get into fourth gear . She 's got to find that out herself . I will tell you it 's not about breaking the sound barrier . It 's about breaking light , just like breaking ice under your wheels . MAGGOT Never met anyone like you . COD I 'm not surprised . Want to see a trick ? ( Cod touches the floor with his hand . His hand imprint starts to smoke . ) MAGGOT Are n't we the Boy Scout ! COD With some women it works . MAGGOT Son of a bitch . COD Do n't think so ; never knew my mother . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat factory . No . That 's not it . It was the No Yes the Triangle Shirtwaist Company in New York City , some time ago . Turn of the century . MAGGOT Just when were you born ? COD The fire started in a rag bin on the seventh floor , swept through the eighth , ninth and tenth floors . Mostly young women . My mother jumped . A lot of them did . They went in pairs . Holding hands . Nothing below them but concrete . My mother landed on top of some others . She was n't crushed up like the rest of them . I was inside her . She was dead , but I was n't . When the doctors found out I was in there , they ventilated her for five months . It was an experiment . They 'd already filled out her death certificate . Then they cut her open and took me out . p. 78 MAGGOT I heard about that fire . COD Yeah . I was born from a dead woman . MAGGOT That fire happened over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a hell of a way to come in to the world . p. 79 Act 2 , Scene 7 SCENE SEVEN Brandon sneaks into the women 's changing room . He 's not sure what he 's looking for . He sees a woman 's work dress . He smells and touches it sensually , in much the same way as he did the meat in Act I , Scene Ten . BRANDON " I have lain in prison Out of my nature has come wild despair  --  " ( He takes the dress in his arms . Roach enters , watches unobserved for some moments. ) "  --  an abandonment to grief that was piteous even to look at . " ( Beat ) No . Not on your knees . ( Tries again ) My darling , my dreams are dark , dark , dark . ( Beat ) Damn . Do n't bring up color .

( Takes off his clothes , turning away to do so ) No peeking ! ( Roach watches him undress and put the dress on as he speaks : ) Oh , I 'm just a girl , a waif like a wafer you could snap in two , just a gosling in distress , an egret with no inlet to satisfy my pitiable appetites . ROACH Shush up , baby doll . Or I 'll tear your fucking heart out with my teeth . BRANDON Oh , no , no , no . ( Beat ) Oh , yes , yes , yes . ( Roach is silent . ) Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny , little pieces . ROACH I forget the script . BRANDON Now you force me . ROACH I force you . BRANDON Yeah .

ROACH And I do it all the way down BRANDON You got it . p. 81 ROACH I wo n't be able to wear it again if I do that . BRANDON Do n't worry , darling , I 've got one at home I can lend you ROACH Shut up . ( Roach rips the dress open so that Brandon 's chest is exposed . This should be done how we 've seen it in countless melodramatic films . ) I could get into this style . BRANDON And now you go on now you ROACH Chew your mouth up , right ? BRANDON And the eternal flames of hell engulf us . ROACH I do n't think so . BRANDON Trespass matures the soul . ROACH It would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nineties . ROACH A Puerto Rican friend of mine had some teeth kicked out for dating a white girl . BRANDON My friends wo n't mind ; I do n't have any . ROACH What 's the deal ? Does it make you feel bad ' cause I 'm black ? BRANDON You want me . ROACH You 're a boy , Brandon . p. 82 BRANDON You want me and you hate me for it . ROACH This is a kid 's game . I 'm not playing . BRANDON You 're a coward . ROACH I just like things simple . BRANDON Look . These are the facts . I like your mouth . It 's the only place on earth I ever felt like laying a foundation to make a home . ROACH This would n't be simple . BRANDON I have this dream sometimes . And in the dream the scars on my mouth are gone , and my mouth is like it 's scorched , seared , and then you kiss me and your kiss is so cold . ( Gently runs a finger over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Roach removes his hand ) When I wake up from that kiss , my pillow is always wet and I 'm crying like a baby . ROACH A kiss is a dangerous thing . BRANDON It 's a dangerous thing to live without it . ( Beat ) Are you afraid of me ? ROACH ( Laughs ) : I 'm afraid of me . BRANDON I wo n't give it up . ROACH No . I do n't think you will . All right . ( Takes one of Brandon 's knives ) I 'll give you a kiss . If . p. 83 BRANDON If ? ROACH If you can take this knife from me . ( Beat ) But if either one of us bleeds , if either one of us gets so much as a paper cut , it 's over . And we 'll never talk about us again . Agreed ? ( Beat ) Agreed ? BRANDON Yeah . Completely . ( Roach puts the blade between her teeth . Slowly and carefully she passes the knife from her mouth to Brandon 's mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss . During this transfer , Brandon is pushed to his knees . He holds the knife between his teeth as he kneels . ) ROACH That 's where I like my Tarzan . On his knees . p. 84 Act 2 , Scene 8 SCENE EIGHT Maggot and Roach on break . Maggot is smoking . Roach drinks a glass of water . They hardly hear what the other is saying . MAGGOT I 've been thinking about trading the Ford . ROACH He 's a kid . But he 's a smart kid . MAGGOT You ever had a Chevy ? ROACH He 's not really a kid , I mean , he 's twenty-two . That 's about ( Counts on her fingers ) MAGGOT A Chevy can take a lot of rust . ROACH Not so bad . MAGGOT And the front end wo n't go out at a hundred thousand . ROACH But he 's awfully white . Do n't you think he 's awfully white ? MAGGOT He 's Irish . They do n't get much sun . ROACH A bit young and a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decade ? ROACH Thanks . MAGGOT I love you , you know . ROACH What 's out there will keep coming between you and me . If you ever forget it , we 're finished . When it comes down to it , they 're going to try and break one of us , and , more likely than not , it 's going to be me . And you 're going to stand by and watch . p. 85 MAGGOT I could n't get a job anywhere else . ROACH You could n't get a friend like me anywhere else . MAGGOT That 's for sure . ROACH So has he got a spotty ass ? MAGGOT I have n't got that close yet . ( Beat ) I 've had some crushes , you know , pretty serious before . But I never felt like the ones I knew could reach down inside me , grab a hold of my tailbone and turn me inside out , like a shirt . ROACH I know what you mean . MAGGOT And Cod 's got this smell Ahhh A smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROACH I kissed Brandon the other day . MAGGOT No ! ROACH It was interesting . MAGGOT Interesting ? What 's he taste like ? ROACH Like nothing . ( Beat ) Nice . MAGGOT This one 's over my head . ( Roach turns around . ) ROACH Yeah . It is . ( Beat ) Close your eyes . ( Maggot does . Roach tilts Maggot 's face up . ) Brandon tastes ( She pours the water slowly and gently onto Maggot 's face . ) Like this . Like water . Like drinking one , two , three glasses of water . p. 86 p. 87 Act 2 , Scene 9 SCENE NINE Roach and Maggot are still standing together in the shadows . Sausage Man appears . No one sees him but Cod . SAUSAGE MAN It 's time for you to go . COD Not yet . SAUSAGE MAN I can feel the heat coming off your body a hundred years from now . Why do n't we go there ? COD I 'm not leaving this time . SAUSAGE MAN You 're trying my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this son of a bitch ! ( Neither Roach nor Maggot hear Cod . ) SAUSAGE MAN I 've let you stay far too long already . COD Check this joker out ! SAUSAGE MAN Listen , I 'm getting tired of playing rivals . COD Go back to the hell you crawled out of . SAUSAGE MAN I want you to come work for me . On my side this time . We 'd make a good team . You 're sensitive . You listen to the meat . You 'd know how to coax it into my grinder without a struggle . Without a strike . We could start anew . COD This time it 's going to be different . ( Roach exits . Maggot remains on stage , finishing her cigarette . Cod turns away from Sausage Man . ) I ca n't touch her . I ca n't . You know that . I ca n't touch anyone like that . I 'd burn them to a cinder . Turn their heart to a chunk of coal . But in my head . No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch her over and over . Again and again . ( Cod approaches Maggot closely ; Maggot is unaware of Cod . ) And her skin is cold and sweet . Ice forms at the corners of her mouth . Just before we kiss . And across the world it 's winter . In the fields . Inside the houses . Even under our tongues . Winter . ( Maggot exits . ) But , even in my own head , I ca n't make her touch me . Because I do n't know what it 's like to be touched . What ? What ? Does it cut or maul ? Scratch or tear ? Tell me . Is it pain ? You do n't know . But it must be pain , because my heart is a cheap toy and it breaks inside my chest each time I try to imagine : what would it feel like to have her hand on my breast , her fingers along my spine . Her hard mouth against my hip . And what would it be like to stop moving at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the pulse in her wrist . No rage , no hurry , no you and me , no struggle . Just her blood , to and fro , in her wrist , against my ear . ( Beat ) I am alone . I have never been anything but alone . Let her touch me . And I 'll know where I am. p. 88 SAUSAGE MAN What a sermonizer the decades have made you . You'd 've made your mother proud . But reality wo n't be changed , Cod . COD It 's nothing more than a bucket of clay , and this time we 're going to shape it . SAUSAGE MAN It might go bad if you push me . Things are n't ripe yet . COD Yeah , well sometimes history 's just not ready for you and so you give it a shove . SAUSAGE MAN Snap of my fingers and you 're toad 's dust . COD But then there 's no conflict . And if there 's no conflict , then I wo n't exist . And neither will you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't make me fight you ; I quit . SAUSAGE MAN Damn you . Damn you ! ( Beat ) All right . If you wo n't play , then you 'll have to pay . But how much ? ( Sausage Man gestures to the shadows , where in the darkness we see the shadow of the Textile Worker working . She shines with a strange light . ) How much will you pay ? ( Beat ) Listen . " Pull the cloth , punch it down , cut three out , and trace . " Can you hear her ? She 's talking . Oh , yes , and laughing . Because it 's Friday and it 's almost time to quit work . ( Cod puts his hands over his ears so he wo n't hear Sausage Man , who seems to be physically hurting him by recounting the story . ) And she feels you kick inside her , and she whispers something to you , and she is happy because she 's managed to borrow a crib from a friend and because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jack be nimble , Jack be quick , Jack tripped over the candlestick . " Stupid , stupid Jack . Now flames are coming up through the floor boards at her feet . Can you hear her , Cod ? She 's not laughing anymore . No . She 's making another sound now . Listen . ( We hear the sound of tremendous pressure being released , the sound of something bursting forth from its restraints . Then we hear a terrible scream of pain from offstage . At the same moment Cod and the Textile Worker shout : ) p. 89 COD AND TEXTILE WORKER No ! p. 90 Act 2 , Scene 10 SCENE TEN Brandon is lying on the floor . Roach and Cod are beside him . Maggot paces . MAGGOT Ten minutes . They said ten minutes . ROACH Where 's the fucking first aid ! He 's not breathing . COD ( To Maggot ) : Call the fire department . ROACH He 's not breathing !

Just breathe . BRANDON ( Begins to struggle ) : Fuck . COD ( Shouts ) : Maggot ? ! ( To Roach ) Keep his head back . ( Cod takes out a knife. ) p. 91 ROACH What the hell are you doing ? COD His windpipe 's gone . I 'm punching a hole so he can get some air . ( Cod cuts into Brandon 's neck to make a hole so he can breathe . This is a medical procedure , and Cod knows what he 's doing . ) ROACH Where are they ? COD Keep his head back . ROACH Maggot ! ( Cod strips off his shirt to put it under Brandon 's head . ) COD It will help him breathe . ( His shirt removed , we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cod is a woman .

Sausage Man kneels beside Brandon , removes the knife , and gently blows into Brandon 's neck as though blowing out a candle .
