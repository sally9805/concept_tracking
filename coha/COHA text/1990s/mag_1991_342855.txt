" We are not alone . God is with us . He 'll help us move ahead . " With those words , engineer-educator Jorge Serrano Elias , 45 , piously hailed his smashing victory last week in Guatemala 's presidential elections . As Serrano 's comments underlined , religious issues had played a significant role in the campaign . Serrano is a Protestant who , in a predominantly Roman Catholic country , converted from Catholicism to fervent Pentecostalism at age 28 . Backers of his Catholic opponent made open appeals against the prospect of a Protestant President . Serrano promised he would not use presidential powers to favor his faith , and his impressive 68% win indicated that the electorate believed him . <P> Serrano personifies a religious shift that is steadily gaining momentum , not only in Guatemala but also across traditionally Catholic Latin America . Evangelical Protestantism now claims as much as 30% of the Guatemalan population . Throughout the region , Evangelicals , as Protestants of all types are called , have increased from 15 million to at least 40 million since the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant director of an interdenominational research institute in Sao Paulo , is facing " a serious crisis . As the Evangelical movement grows stronger by the day , the Catholic Church is getting weaker and weaker . " <P> Two recent U.S. books describe this dramatic trend . Is Latin America Turning Protestant ? is the provocative title of a volume by Stanford graduate student David Stoll , who argues that Evangelicalism 's spiritual appeal " calls into question the claims made for its great rival , " the Marxist-tinged liberation theology that was the hope of the Catholic left . By all appearances , says Stoll , " born-again religion has the upper hand . " In Tongues of Fire : The Explosion of Protestantism in Latin America , David Martin of the London School of Economics asserts that the growth of conservative Protestantism in Latin America , Asia and Africa is as significant as the rise of revolutionary Islam . <P> As both books underscore , the Protestant Gospel offers Latin Americans new hope and spiritual solace within close-knit local churches , amid the dispiriting realities of everyday life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Pentecostal chambermaid in Rio de Janeiro , says , " I am happiest when I am in church , praying , singing , surrounded by the love of Jesus . " Says Ricardo Araujo , a Sao Paulo construction worker who has joined the Baptists , " Without Jesus , I was nobody , but I have found myself through him . " <P> Catholic prelates , long passive in the face of creeping Protestantism , are increasingly jittery about the threat . Brazil 's bishops have debated plans to halt the worrisome defections . Guatemala 's Archbishop Prospero Penados del Barrio issued a harsh letter charging that the U.S. government is boosting Evangelicalism to " help consolidate its economic and political power . " Pope John Paul II believes the inroads of unnamed " sects " could become " disastrous . " During last year 's tour of Mexico , designed in part to counter Evangelicalism , the Pontiff directed clergy to abandon " timidity and diffidence " in combatting their rivals .                @ @ @ @ @
