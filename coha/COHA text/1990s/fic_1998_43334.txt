NOT GUILTY ! " CRIED THE foreman of the jury that day in 1989 , and the courtroom in the New Orleans federal court " erupted in pandemonium , " as next morning 's Times-Picayune expressed it . <p> My lawyer , who had been nervously fingering some documents , tossed his papers into the air and embraced me . Then my family came swarming out of the spectators ' seats and piled on . Little Pierrette , my beautiful little girl , rushed into my arms , crying , " Daddy , Daddy ! " My wife Amy gazed up at me with limpid blue eyes . My brother Ned pounded me on the back . My mother , who was weeping , plucked at my sleeve until I bent and kissed her . Aunts and uncles and in-laws crowded around me , weeping , laughing , congratulating . <p> " The luck of the Carcassonnes ! " thundered a hoarse , hollow voice from somewhere at the back of the throng . <p> Yes , it was a party . Pity my Great-Aunt Kate was dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . Truly , mine had been an ordeal by law . All those accusations in civil court regarding my stewardship at Goldenacres Savings and Loan , and then that final , dreadful criminal charge - that I had procured the murder of the government 's star witness ! <p> The media were waiting like a school of circling sharks just outside Courtroom No. 3 that I had gotten to know so well during the long , bitter days of the trial . By this time I knew how to handle them . I let the lawyer talk while I stood holding Pierrette on one arm and clutching Amy to me with the other . When it was my turn to speak I just said : <p> " This has been a terrible experience for my family , but thank God , the system works . I just wish the government had some better things to do than hound honest businessmen , that 's all . " <p> Nothing more than that . You can always give thanks and damn the government safely . Anything else would n't have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you actually think . They 'll use the truth to kill you . <p> Then it was time for all of us to go to Mother 's house for the victory banquet , laid on in advance of the verdict because she , too , believed in the luck of the Carcassonnes . <p> We were all there , over a hundred people of all ages , filling the house and overflowing on the lawn and surrounding the pool . The caterers were working themselves to death unloading their vans , for Mother 's kitchen could n't possibly have cooked all the food . Our new puppy , Grits VI , got under everyone 's feet and barked himself hoarse . The waiters , many of them college kids hired for the day , ran around with their trays like ants carrying pieces of dismembered bugs . <p> The place of honor was the dining room table where I sat with Amy , Mother , Ned and his wife , and a few others . All the inner circle except Great - Aunt Rate , who was in her grave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell some assets of the Islamic Republic of Iran . A long , noisy table of us - inlaws and outlaws , as they say-and all of us , I was aware , somehow sounding and gesturing alike even though we were so different . The family . <p> Even our Founder was there , hanging in his portrait over the table . While waiting for the main course to arrive I glanced up at him - a fiercelooking old man with a cataract of white whiskers . Under the varnish his suit was shiny black , his eyes were glittering black , and his linen gleamed like a mountain of white ore . The polished brass plate under the portrait said Pierre Carcassonne . Le Fondateur , 1868 . <p> He had been there every mealtime while I was growing up . Pierre the Great , Daddy like to call him . The Founder . Founder of what ? Ned asked once when he was still little and dumb . Of our family , said Daddy , reverently , and we were all solemnly silent for as much as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not in God , the devil or the flag , but in our family . <p> We lived in the same big house with its nineteen rooms and five baths overlooking Audubon Park in uptown New Orleans . We had formal gardens , tennis courts , and an Olympic-sized swimming pool in marble and tile and a bronze lion-head that gushed cold green brine from our own artesian well . Money that Daddy had made by helping the Shah of Iran to invest a tiny part of his billions in Louisiana had paid for the well and the pool , so we called it the Shah 's Pool . The deal with Teheran was part of the family legend . Other aspects of the legend- the important people we had met , the money we had made , the secrets we knew-sparkled in the backs of our minds like the paste jewels in the glass case in Aunt Kate 's living room on Prytania Street that marked the time she had been Queen of Astarte , the best women 's carnival krewe . No Carcassonne had yet been Rex , King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Ultimately everything we had derived from Pierre the Great , who had emigrated from Toulouse or Marseilles or someplace in the early nineteenth century and become a cotton factor and speculator . Though we knew little about him , some of his oddities were remembered - for example , the fact , remarkable for those times , that he had refused to own slaves . For whatever reason , he had been no friend of the Confederacy or the southern war effort . During the Civil War when others were going bankrupt most of his wealth had reposed comfortably in the Bank of England , earning more money that in the postwar depression had enabled him to buy up valuable sugar land for a song . His sons and grandsons made more money by investing in the brand-new oilfields of the Gulf and Texas . <p> In Daddy 's generation the Carcassonnes were doctors , lawyers , investment bankers , and stockbrokers . They divided the inheritance but also multiplied it . They called themselves " the hundred cousins " and together with their spouses they possessed about nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business but also did some offbeat things , producing among other oddballs an artist who sold bad paintings for exorbitant prices and a drug-runner who never wound up in the penitentiary , although he probably should have . They too shared the luck of the Carcassonnes . <p> I was a bookworm as a child and for a long time I was drawn to the study of history . Daddy was not too happy over that , pointing out to me that there was no money in it . He probably thought I lacked the courage to do more adventurous things , and in that he may have been right . But when I persevered , he told me to go ahead , warning me however that my trust fund would not be a nickel larger than Ned 's , whose goal was to become an investment banker . <p> I think it was the general air of polite disapproval at home that caused me , in 1970 when I was in my first year as a graduate student at Tulane , to become interested in writing a biography of Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my profession could add , however slightly , to the luster of the family name . <p> The first thing I found out was that tracking down Pierre Carcassonne was surprisingly difficult . For a family as narcissistic as ours , we turned out to own little in the way of papers . Interesting papers , anyway . Account books , yes , we had those , by the dozen . From ledgers of the 1850 's I could see how Pierre had shifted his money around , crisscrossing the Atlantic with his interests , moving cotton between the New Orleans warehouses and those in Liverpool and banking the profits on Threadneedle Street in the City of London and using them to speculate on the Exchange and the Bourse . <p> He obviously had believed that the United States of his day was a great place to make money but a very poor place to store it , and a series of panics and depressions and bank failures culminating in the disasters of the Civil War proved him right . At any rate , he never ended a year without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when New Orleans fell to the federal fleet . <p> But where were the letters and diaries that alone can make a dead person come to life ? I could find none , except copies of business letters which were only a bit less boring than the account books . I had real hopes of Aunt Kate , but she put me off , saying that her house was such a mess she could find nothing in it . Other relatives came up only with bits and pieces . A letter consisting in its entirely of the words " Yours of the 7th inst. rec 'd and I thank you for it " tells you little about the writer except that he was terse . I finished the meager materials stored in family safes and desks knowing little or nothing of the real Pierre Carcassonne except that he had been shrewd , and I had known that before I started . <p> I could not even discover where he was buried . In Metairie Cemetery the Carcassonnes had a pompous family vault with walls and roof of granite and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the first people to be buried there were Daddy 's grandparents . Some earlier members of our family reposed in an uptown cemetery across from Commander 's Palace restaurant - very convenient , Daddy liked to say , if their appetites were anything like those of my brother and myself ! But Pierre the Great was not there , nor did he seem to be anyplace else . <p> On my hours off , when I was neither lecturing at Tulane nor being lectured to , I poked around in the older cemeteries , hoping to get lucky . Soon I made a number of new acquaintances among sextons and caretakers , and among a curious collection of people who were victims of genealogical obsessions . These students of the past moved in hunched postures from gravestone to gravestone , copying names and dates ; they made rubbings of interesting epitaphs and the quaint carvings  --  winged hourglasses , weeping willows , sorrowing angels - that Victorian stonemasons used to memorialize grief . I liked the genealogists because they , too , believed in the importance of family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to connect their ancestors to the Romanoffs or the Borgias . <p> The genealogists and I would bring po'boy sandwiches in brown bags and eat lunch among the tombs , sitting on marble benches under the big old trees and breathing deeply in the murmurous summer silence that reduced the noise of the city to a distant beelike hum of traffic . One day I was munching my sandwich in St. Louis Cemetery No. 3 and talking to a tatty old lady who claimed to be descended ( by the wrong side of the blanket from the Archduke Francis Ferdinand . The archduke , she said , had been on the verge of legitimizing her grandfather when Ferdinand 's assassination and the First World War put an end to the project . " It preyed on Grandpa 's mind , " she said . " Not that being illegitimate bothers anybody anymore , but he was of the old school . He studied French in order to write his own diplomatic dispatches in case the Hapsburg throne should ever be re-established and his claim to it recognized . His last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ un bdtard . " <p> That seemed sad to me , being forever a bastard . Since she had confided in me , I told her about my search for the grave of my great-great grandfather , Pierre Carcassonne , and my fear that he must have died outside the city , since I could find no trace of him in New Orleans . <p> " That 's an unusual name , " she said thoughtfully . " Now , where have I seen it before ? " <p> I was about to suggest that our family was locally prominent and often mentioned in the newspaper . But then she brightened and exclaimed , <p> " Oh , I 've seen that grave ! " <p> " You have ! " <p> " Oh , yes . I often forget faces , but I never forget a grave . Now let me see ... it was in ... it was in .. . it was in .... Oh , I know . It 's in the St. Dismas cemetery , on the Basin Street side somewhere . Yes , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition , I 'm afraid . " <p> Candidly , I did not believe her . But I wanted to believe , and a little light had switched on in my head when she said St. Dismas . This was indeed a very old cemetery , once located just outside the ramparts when New Orleans was still a fortified town . But it had soon become a burial ground for people of dubious antecedents , including some of Jean Lafitte 's pirates . It also held many of the city 's free blacks . Many had been people of wealth and education , highly respectable and much respected . But they , too , had had their bad apples , including a couple of voodoo queens buried in marble tombs that people still marked with red crosses , hoping to keep the witches inside . <p> It seemed to me as I thanked my friend for her help that one of the obscurities surrounding Pierre the Great - his refusal to own slaves might be clarified if he turned out to have been a mulatto or quadroon who had married a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been illegal at that time , but wealth finds a way , and the number of local white families with black ancestors is almost as large as the number of blacks with white forebears . <p> As I reflected on the features of the old patriarch in the portrait , I could find neither support nor refutation for my idea . Were the lips hidden in that cascade of moustache and beard as thin as Europe or as full as Africa ? No telling - and the painter had probably adjusted both features and coloring to accord with the wishes of his model . <p> Nevertheless , as I drove to Basin Street I was almost humming with excitement . I was without conscious racism myself , and since Daddy had predicted that the next Mayor of New Orleans would be a black Creole I could see no reason for anyone to be ashamed of such a connection any longer . I particularly relished the thought of how my more pompous relatives , who scorned history as a useless pursuit , would be floored if I turned up clear evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still young enough to relish the sheer shock value of such a revelation . <p> I will not waste time telling of my slow and somewhat dangerous search for Pierre 's tomb . Dangerous because the neighborhood had gone bad and I would not have dared to go there alone at any time but the afternoon of a sunny day when well-guarded tourist parties could be expected to arrive also . Suffice it to say that after several anxious and muddy hours spent mostly on my hands and knees , I discovered at last what appeared to be the grave of the Founder . <p> It was much smaller and in much worse condition than I had expected - merely a chamber of very old , weathered and broken brick , cracked by the roots of trees that had themselves died and become part of the cemetery earth generations ago . There were no remains inside , only a bundle of old newspapers reduced by damp to papier machi , which showed that a derelict had been sleeping there at some time in the not too remote past , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislodged square of marble lying beside it was much eroded by the rain and the words cut into it were only partly legible : <p> The French part of the inscription was easy : Pierre Carcassonne/N6 le 2me Aout , ... 8/Dgc6d6 le 31re Octobre , 18 . 8 . In English , he was born the second of August in a year ending in 8 and died the thirty-first of October , probably in 1868 , the year of the portrait . This suggested to me that he knew the end was close and had had the picture painted in order to fix his image in the minds of his descendants . <p> IMG
