My grandmother , a stout little old pioneer woman , had come West by wagon and never tired of torturing me with tales of her labors when she was my age . During winter she had walked 40 miles to school and home again through snow eight feet deep and was n't absent or even tardy a single day . During summer she single-handedly cooked for logging crews of 800 men , and then , after washing and drying all the dishes , she split up a couple of cords of firewood . Now , in old age , her sole responsibility was looking after me while my mother was away at work . <p> " And land sakes , Pat , " she confided in me one August afternoon , " looking after you is the hardest chore the Good Lord ever thrust upon me as retribution for my sins . " " What sins are those , Gram ? Anything I 'd be interested in ? " <p> " I should say not ! The whole passel of ' em would n't hold a cane to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an average day . Now what instrument of the devil are you foolin ' with ? " <p> " Oh , this is Whomper , Gram , the world 's most powerful slingshot . I made it myself . " I held up Whomper in all its mighty glory : a forked , two-foot section of trunk chopped from a thornapple tree , woven bands of rubber thick as a logger 's wrist , and a leather pouch fashioned from the whole tongue of a boot , all the elements laced together with baling wire . <p> Gram shook her head . " If that ai n't about the most useless thing I ever seen , not counting yourself , of course . " <p> " It 's not useless . I use Whomper for hunting elk . " <p> " Pshaw ! There you go with your tall tales . " <p> " I did n't say I ever got an elk with it . " <p> " I should think not . Why , there ai n't a man in the world strong enough to pull that slingshot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last year at the loggers ' picnic , Rancid Crabtree shot a stone as big as a peach clear out of sight with it . He said the strain laid him up in bed for three days afterwards , but he actually shot Whomper . " I was a little hesitant to mention the old woodsman , my friend and mentor , because Rancid and Gram were enemies of long standing . <p> " You stop with your fibs , young man ! Still , it would n't surprise me none if that lazy old fool Crabtree tried such a stunt , just to show o &; Speaking of lazy , I 've got a job for you . Go get a hatchet and help me cut my punkin loose from the vine . I told Crabtree I 'd pay him a dollar to haul it to the fair for me . He did n't want to , because it too much resembled work , but his greed got the better of him . " <p> Ever since I could remember , one of Gram 's pumpkins had taken Grand Prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on size alone , with no points deducted for ugliness . This year would be no different . Gram 's secret pumpkin fertilizer , its ingredients too disgusting even to mention  --  and no doubt why I let them remain a secret  --  had this year produced a gigantic orange monstrosity that was almost frightening to behold . <p> It was the sort of pumpkin that could give a person nightmares : Townsfolk flee for their lives as the orange monster rumbles down Main Street , crushing bicycles and overturning cars , the police firing their guns into it  --  Thunk ! Thunk ! Thunk !  --  but the pumpkin , unfazed and indestructible , rumbles relentlessly on toward the grade school ! ( Some nightmares are better than others . ) <p> Gram 's pumpkin , a great hideous blob of orange , must have weighed at least 400 pounds . The two of us could n't budge it so much as an inch . With Gram shouting orders and threats , I chopped through the thick , sinuous vine , half afraid that I was turning the pumpkin loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pumpkin , then frowned at me . " If you was n't such a slothful little critter , you could have grown something for the fair yourself or even made something for the children 's crafts . " <p> " Like what , one of those milk stools , where they take two pieces of two-by-four and nail them into the shape of a T ? Hey , maybe I 'll enter Whomper . I bet he 'd win something . " <p> " Good grief ! " <p> Just then we heard the sound of a truck driving up and stopping on the other side of the house . " I 'll bet that 's Rancid now , " I said . <p> Gram sniffed the air . " Yep , that 's him all right . I reckon he forgot his bath again last year . That makes about five years runnin ' . " <p> Rancid came moseying out to the garden . He bit off a chaw of tobacco as he stared down at Gram 's pumpkin . " Wahl , iffen thet ai n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old woman , Ah 'll eat maw hat and throw in maw suspenders besides . You must be breakin ' a law of some sort , growin ' a thang like thet . Ought to be ashamed of yersef . " <p> " Oh , what does an old reprobate like you know about punkins , or anything else for that matter ? " Gram growled at him . " You want that dollar or not ? " <p> " Spect Ah do . Ah 'll winch the monster up onto maw truck , but iffen it tries to grab me , Ah 'm cuttin ' it loose , dollar or no dollar . " <p> A couple of days later , Rancid and I went to the fair together and wandered around looking at the canning exhibits , the wildlife exhibits and the various farm animals . " Ah likes the pigs best , " Rancid said , reaching over a pen to scratch the back of a huge sow . " Pigs has got character . Ah kinda feels a kinship with them . " <p> " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She did , did she ? Hmmm . Ah 'm surprised she 'd have a good word for me . You sure you 're not makin ' thet up ? " <p> " Nope . It 's what she said all right . " <p> " Wahl , Ah 'd say sumpin ' good about her , too , iffen Ah could thank of sumpin ' . " <p> Just then a loudspeaker announced that pumpkin judging was about to begin . Rancid blew 30 cents of his dollar to buy us each a hot dog , and then we walked over to the open-sided shed where a couple of dozen pumpkins were lined up on a row of sturdy tables . We strolled along eating our hot dogs as we checked out the pumpkins , with Rancid still complaining about his purchase . <p> " Dang highway robbers , " he muttered . <p> " Thirty cents for two hot dogs . Git'em fer 10 cents apiece anyplace but the fair . They should n't even call it fair , if they 's gon na cheat folks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumpkins , " I said . " There 's some mighty big ones here , but Gram 's still looks a little bigger than all the rest . You want to know her secret fertilizer formula , Rance ? " <p> " Not whiles Ah 'm eatin ' . Hey , wait a minute . Thet biggest punkin ai n't your granny 's ! Thet 's old man Fleegle 's . Chet Fleegle 's . Ha ! The old woman 's got hersef beat this y'ar ! " <p> " Oh no ! You 're right ! " I gasped . " Mr. Fleegle 's pumpkin does look bigger than Gram 's . She 's going to be so disappointed ! You ca n't imagine how hard she worked growing that pumpkin . " <p> We glanced at the crowd of spectators , always small for the pumpkin judging . Mr. Fleegle was standing back , arms folded , a confident grin on his face . Gram looked sad and disappointed . She did n't have to wait for the pumpkins to be weighed to know that the Grand Prize had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the embarrassment of a miserable and meaningless First . <p> " I ca n't stand to watch this , " I said . <p> " Ah 'm kinda enjoyin ' it mawsef , " Rancid said . " The excitement just keeps buildin ' up , do n't it ? Hope maw heart can stand it . " <p> " I 'm leaving , " I said . " I think I 'll go enter Whomper in the children 's crafts . Maybe I 'll win Grand Prize and save the family honor . " <p> " Ah would n't count on it . " <p> We walked across a little open area to where the children 's crafts judging was to be held . I looked at the competition . Nothing . I counted five two-by-four milk stools , along with a coffee table that could have been used as a small teetertotter , a board that Richie McPherson claimed was a shelf , and several items I could n't identify . Whomper was a cinch to win Grand Prize . <p> Barney " Fig " Neuton , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already gathered for the judging . <p> " Is it too late to enter something in the children 's crafts , Mr. Neuton ? " I asked . <p> " No , you 're just in time . Where 's your entry ? " <p> I pulled Whomper from the holster on the back of my belt . " Right here . " <p> " Hey ! That is some slingshot , Pat ! Do n't think I 've ever seen a slingshot that ... uh ... that husky before . I 'm sorry to tell you this , son , but you ca n't enter your slingshot in children 's crafts . The rules say that any entry has to be useful . And anybody can see that slingshot is impossible to pull . " <p> " Oh , come on , Fig , " Rancid said . " Let him enter his Whomper . " <p> " Ca n't do it , Rancid . Rules are the rules . There is n't a man in the world could pull that slingshot , and you know it . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The old woodsman bent over and hissed in my ear . " Hush ! I ai n't gon na do it fer you ag'in . One pull on thet durn slangshot lasts a man a lifetime and then some . " <p> " But , Rance , " I whined . " Our family honor is at stake ! You ca n't let me down now ! " <p> We both stared across at the pumpkin judging contest . Four helpers were heaving one of the smaller pumpkins up on the scale . Mr. Fleegle 's would be next . And then Gram 's . Mr. Fleegle was beaming brighter than ever . Gram was scuffing the grass with her shoe . <p> Rancid shook his head . " Wahl , since yer granny 's punkin ai n't going to win this y'ar , Ah guess I got to help save yer family honor . " He reached down on the ground and picked up a stone the size of an apricot . " Hand me thet Whomper , Fig . Ah 'll show you how a feeble old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulders . " Oh , give it a try if you want , Rancid , but there 's no way ... " <p> Rancid hauled back on Whomper , grunting mightily . Beads of sweat flew off his forehead . The spectators gasped , but some of them cried out , " Come on , Crabtree , you can do it ! " And slowly , ever so slowly , the bands began to stretch and stretch , humming with tension , and finally , with one last mighty effort , Rancid pulled the slingshot to full stretch . A cheer went up . But then he staggered about in a circle , the slingshot at full pull , its bands singing , and spectators were ducking and dodging and falling over each other to get out of the line of fire . And then , suddenly , Rancid pivoted , aimed , and sent that stone sizzling across the little open area and straight into a 400-pound pumpkin ! That pumpkin exploded like an orange bomb . <p> When I opened my eyes , all I could see was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange spectators , an orange Mr. Fleegle , an orange Gram and even a little orange dog who just happened to be passing by . Our own group of spectators stood in stunned silence . Then somebody began to applaud , and one by one the others joined in . Several men came over and slapped Rancid on the back and said that it was the best darn show they had ever seen at the county fair . <p> Rancid handed Whomper back to the judge . " The boy 's enterin ' Whomper , Fig . " <p> " Right you are , Rancid , right you are . " I tugged on Rancid 's sleeve . " That was great , Rance , great ... but ... but ... " <p> " But what ? " <p> " You shot the wrong pumpkin ! " <p> " No , Ah did n't . " <p> " Yes , you did ! You shot Gram 's ! " <p> " Of course ! It would n't hev been right to shoot poor old Fleegle 's and cheat him out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If yer granny do n't have a punkin , they ai n't no way Fleegle 's punkin can beat hers ! " <p> " Oh . I suppose that 's true . " <p> " Ah thank Ah 'll git goin ' right now , ' cause here comes thet orange old woman , hoppin ' mad . Probably 'll want what 's left of her dollar back . " <p> I never knew exactly why Rancid shot Gram 's 400-pound pumpkin . Maybe it was just to be mean , as Gram claimed , or maybe it was an act of gratitude , for the nice thing she had said about him and the pigs . Whomper did win third place in the children 's crafts , which was less than great , I suppose . But then again , our family did n't have all that much honor to save in the first place . <p>
