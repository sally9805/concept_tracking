Collaborations and partnerships between organizations can enlarge their resource bases ( Kanter , 1994 ) . As a result , many colleges are exploring the advantages of engaging in such relationships ( Roueche , Taber , &; Roueche , 1995 ) . Pfeffer and Salancik ( 1978 ) and Aldrich ( 1979 ) believe that collaborative relations between appropriate organizations increase available resources to each , while also having the potential to decrease some of the uncertainty caused by constant change . <p> Because community college educators can benefit from expanded involvement in collaborative activities with other organizations , many colleges today include commitments to explore collaborative opportunities in their official planning documents or mission statements . The Nevada University and Community College System 's ( 1993 ) planning report for 1993-1997 , for example , states that the system " will emphasize and enhance collaborative programs within the system and between the system and other institutions and agencies " ( p. 11 ) . There is also evidence in the literature of an expanding number of working partnerships in the nation 's community colleges ( Tushnet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature about community colleges ' innovative collaborations or strategic partnerships directed at developing or enhancing facilities . This article will ( a ) discuss a range of approaches for addressing collaborative facility development ; ( b ) review examples of creative community college facilities acquisition , construction , leasing , shared-usage , and management styles ; and ( c ) identify future issues and selected challenges involved with such collaborations . Organizational Bridging Strategies <p> It is one thing to plan a collaboration and quite another to accomplish it to the satisfaction of all partners . Many approaches to developing relationships with organizations are important to community colleges . Pfeffer and Salancik ( 1978 ) describe eight bridging strategies  --  different ways to develop mutually beneficial relationships between organizations : Co-optation involves members of significant constituencies in college decision-making or advising processes . Hierarchical contracts involve relationship agreements between levels of educational sectors . Mergers involve two independent organizations becoming one . Associations include coalitions , cooperatives , and councils that enable members with similar objectives to work together . Joint ventures involve a limited pooling of resources by two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections involve local , state , and regional governments serving as authorities for legal transactions between and among community colleges and other entities . Bargaining involves helping the college influence state agencies to regulate their activities so that demands on the college become more realistic . Contracting includes negotiated agreements between two or more parties that attempt to reduce future uncertainty . <p> Each of the above bridging strategies , alone or in combination , has the potential to facilitate successful solutions to a community college 's particular facilities needs . Community colleges are beginning to use the whole range of collaborative bridging strategies to effect creative , alternative facilities arrangements for libraries and learning resource centers , higher education complexes , mixed centers , joint-use recreational facilities , and use of retail or other commercial spaces . Examples of Creative Collaborative Approaches <p> Libraries and learning resources centers . Demands for appropriate community college learning resources facilities services are expanding due to ( a ) the increased diversity of the student population ; ( b ) changes in teaching and learning theories that require many sources and modes of delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur in the information industry  --  in particular the production , storage , and dissemination of information ( Cepeda &; Norman , 1992 ) . A recent report acknowledged that , " The expansive nature of the work ahead requires not only increased partnerships with local programs , but also increased state-level resources . Given the serious fiscal crisis . . . creative alternatives must be explored " ( Cepeda &; Norman , 1992 , p. 12 ) . This statement could have described the existing situation in nearly any one of the 50 states . Authority to establish library services and standards in California indicates that , " the governing board of each community college district shall provide library services . . . by establishing and maintaining . . . libraries or by contractual arrangements with another public agency italics added " ( Cepeda &; Norman , 1992 , p. 3 ) . This wording opens the door for increasing collaborative partnerships in that state . <p> Metropolitan Community College ( MCC ) , in Omaha , Nebraska has been engaging in discussions with Omaha libraries to consider such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and MCC is pressed for instructional space . Together we are beginning to explore the possibilities of joining our two organizations so that we can provide those services that we are most capable of providing in cost effective ways within the branch library settings . Both organizations will save money while concentrating on their areas of greatest strength and ability . ( Gilliland , 1995 , p. 47 ) <p> In addition to developing library facilities with a partner organization , community colleges are taking advantage of another major set of opportunities for collaboration . The proliferation of networked electronic devices ( including voice , data , and video communications ) means that community colleges can expand their resources by participating in these networks . Doucette ( 1993 ) , for example , reports that among some universities , interactive audiovisual links connect classrooms for joint graduate programs in chemistry and physics . In addition to offering joint academic programs , electronic networking can provide worldwide access to libraries , information services , and databases . Collaborative relations via participation in information networks and joint physical facilities can help community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexes . Providing a variety of educational offerings and services in a central location can substantially benefit community colleges and the communities they serve . Illinois , Florida , South Carolina , and Texas are among the states currently experimenting with joint education centers . <p> The State of Illinois , through the passage of the 1972 Higher Education Cooperation Act , authorized a program of grant funds to support proposed cooperative programs between a local community and an institution of higher education ( BW Associates , 1992b ) . One example of such an activity is a multiuniversity center now located at the Community College of DuPage . Baccalaureate and graduate programs are offered by public and private universities on the DuPage campus . Another Illinois-funded program includes a regional effort to develop telecommunication networks . <p> In Florida , the University of West Florida and Okaloosa-Walton Community College share a 156-acre site with eight buildings and offer undergraduate , graduate , and adult general programs and courses to area students ( Bullock , Fart , &; Wright , 1994 ) . <p> At the University Center at Greenville Technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities offer 26 undergraduate and graduate programs ( Barton , 1995 ) . Member institutions include research universities , an historically black institution , a public land-grant institution , a private church-related college , a private independent undergraduate university , and two regional public universities . A board of directors consisting of presidents of the institutions and an executive committee of academic officers representing each institution govern the University Center and operate under the authority of the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education . The Center , currently housed in a building purchased , renovated , and equipped by Greenville Tech and leased to the consortium , will soon move to a facility donated to the college by a local philanthropist . <p> Because Dallas , Texas , unlike most large American cities , had no university located downtown , city officials , the Central Dallas Association , and the Chamber of Commerce proposed that El Centro College ( the community college serving the inner city ) and several universities join forces to offer lower division , upper division , and graduate courses to city residents . Named the Dallas Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Exxon Foundation to the Alliance for Higher Education in North Texas , development planning began in 1992 . A former downtown department store was renovated to house the effort . <p> The partnership formed as a result of interest in the DEC . . . and the availability of a facility . . . resulted in substantial organizational change for participants . Special approval was granted by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board for all universities to enter this collaborative relationship . A unique self-financing formula was developed . The universities created a common application form and shared course offerings . A " lean " administrative structure was provided by the Alliance for Higher Education on a contract basis . Student recruiting was a joint effort supported by business and industry . The success of the DEC is still uncertain , in part due to the uncertainty of downtown redevelopment and public safety in inner-city Dallas . ( Wenrich &; Hughes , 1995 , pp. 241-242 ) <p> When carefully planned and developed , higher education centers can provide economical access to a full range of college and university education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from those offered by community colleges through graduate programs . This enables them to remain employed full-time or in their residence with family members . This can be especially helpful in less populated areas where opportunities for higher education are limited . Faculty at higher education centers have reported enhanced professional experiences due to opportunities for scholarly exchanges and comparisons of teaching methods . Staff find that articulation between institutions may be vastly improved due to their proximity and their increased understanding of each institution 's requirements . <p> Mixed centers . Sometimes shared facilities house educational services and programs as well as related noneducational activities , pooling resources to provide numerous benefits . A new facility at the Los Rios Community College District in Sacramento , California , called the Eldorado Education Center , for example , will house the El Dorado County Office of Education , an elementary school , a child care facility open to the college and to county residents , and will provide a campus for 2,500 to 4,000 students ( BW Associates , 1992b ) . <p> Kirkwood Community College collaborated with a hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share a building for delivery of both education and patient services . One large-scale example of collaborating to share facilities involves Humber College in Toronto , Canada ( Gordon , 1995 ) . The college 's leaders determined that it would be necessary for Humber College to consolidate some of its campuses in order to reconfigure its physical facilities and better serve student and customer markets . Because no capital dollars were available from the Ministry of Education and Training for new , large-scale buildings , the college and several other concerned agencies participated in a creative planning effort to meet these needs . After several years , a seven-way partnership was formed that permitted the college to realize its objectives . <p> Simply explained , Humber will move into . . . renovated psychiatric hospital buildings as its new campus , while preserving the buildings ' exteriors for historical purposes . The site of Humber 's existing campus will be turned over to the municipal and metropolitan governments , and will be shared with a local school board to create park land and playing fields . The Ontario Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest government authority involved ) will provide some funding , supporting the creation of expansive green space and sports fields for public use , as well as the preservation of a heritage building to be used for public education . Parking will be shared by the partners . These arrangements , in turn , will give the conservation authority improved access to its lakefront property , and the seventh partner , the Ministry of Education and Training , will be able to oversee the refurbishing of a major college campus at no cost to itself . The whole area will be managed by a joint board of directors , with Humber having full jurisdiction over the use of the refurbished hospital buildings . In order to finance some of these facility renovations , a tract of land owned by Humber , and adjacent to the north campus , will be sold for low-cost housing , thereby generating much-needed revenue . ( Gordon , 1995 , pp. 123-124 ) <p> Centers that combine educational opportunities with services for other customer bases can provide effective , economical alternatives to single-use facilities . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joint-use recreational facilities . Increasingly expensive recreational facilities may be more attainable for community colleges when they join forces with other entities . In 1992 , the planners of a proposed new college  --  Folsom Lake College in California  --  envisioned a site that would include joint-use recreational facilities ( including track , tennis , and baseball ) , funded with $1.2 million from the city of Folsom . In addition , a local developer pledged to provide cooperative funding to enhance a wetlands area on the site that was to become an important part of a biological science laboratory ( BW Associates , 1993 ) . Although the local developer has to date been unable to support the wetlands project , the city of Folsom did follow through on their commitment to the college . Folsom Lake College center presently serves 3,000 students in 15 temporary buildings and features baseball , soccer , and tennis facilities for joint use by the college and the community . <p> In Irving , Texas , North Lake College ( a Dallas County Community College District institution ) , the Irving Independent School District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wenrich &; Hughes , 1995 ) . The college , school district , and city jointly operate the facility , which hosts community recreational swimming opportunities , high school and college swimming classes , and competitive activities . <p> Another college in the Dallas County Community College District , Richland College , worked with a community-based youth association to construct a soccer complex on college land adjacent to Richland 's current physical education complex and parking lots . Richland College uses the facilities , primarily when the soccer association is not hosting games in the afternoons and on weekends . The soccer association maintains the fields . <p> Use of retail or other commercial spaces . Spaces not heretofore thought of as " college material " may hold potential solutions for difficult facilities problems . Truckee Meadows Community College ( Reno , Nevada ) sought off-campus classroom space because its originally approved campus site , which provided magnificent views and was available at virtually no cost from the federal government , suffered from high elevations and rough terrain that made construction and habitation difficult . Furthermore , its location was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired ( Cimino , 1990 ) . While over 50 different locations in the area served as classroom and laboratory sites for the college , a significant need for space remained . The county library system had simultaneously been having difficulty finding space for branch libraries , and had recently located the Sierra View Branch of the Washoe County Library in a retail facility in Reno called the Old Town Mall . Many characteristics of the mall and its location made it an ideal site for college expansion . <p> The initial effort involved a cooperative venture between the college and the county library that made library service available to area community college students . Mall management indicated that it would give the college the first right of refusal if other space became available . Because the mall was finding it difficult to keep space leased on the second floor , it was willing to offer attractive rates to the college . In what became a valuable relationship for the mall , the county library , the local community college , and the citizens of Reno , the college made arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A college official noted the advantages as follows : <p> The new classrooms in the Mall location have been well received by faculty and students alike . The reduced commuting distance and pleasant atmosphere have been attractive to students and faculty . Some of our faculty have expressed an interest in teaching their full class load at the Old Town Mall Education Center . The National Guard recruiter next door is advertising the tuition benefits available to TMCC students . The library has noticed a positive impact on their patronage . ( Cimino , 1990 , p. 126 ) <p> Other community colleges are considering retail space as an economical alternative to building new facilities . Future Issues and Challenges <p> Mainly due to projected shortfalls in resources , it is not likely that requirements for community college facilities in the coming decades will be met by " expanding existing campuses and building new stand-alone campuses and centers " ( BW Associates , 1992a , p. ii ) . Nevertheless , few policies and procedures currently exist that provide smooth avenues for community colleges to purchase existing buildings or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California Community Colleges ' Commission on Innovation ( BW Associates , 1992b ) suggested that sharing with others the construction , financing , and use of new facilities could lessen costs , if appropriate policy options were implemented . The commission also noted the value of expanding community colleges ' use of space at area high schools , nearby four-year college and university campuses , community sites , local businesses , and military bases . <p> As community colleges increasingly arrange for shared-use facilities , challenges will arise that will need to be resolved . A few of the primary challenges include ( a ) community college legislative relations , ( b ) long-term planning requirements versus the need for flexibility , ( c ) college organizational issues , and ( d ) new roles for community college foundations . <p> Community college legislative relations . Community college relations with state legislatures are important for several reasons . Annual budget allocations have a substantial impact on college operations and help to make capital available for partnership agreements . A planned , well-managed approach to legislative relations can help increase funding for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statewide legislative relations plan was initiated in Florida in 1981 to the 1988 funding year , total funding for the Florida community colleges increased nearly 60% ( Wright , 1991 ) . Current or proposed laws can effectively control the development of collaborative efforts between community colleges and other entities . Since 1972 , for example , the Higher Education Cooperation Act ( HECA ) in Illinois has been authorizing annual appropriations that encourage various types of collaborative projects between and among public and private institutions of higher education in the state and other entities , such as county and city governments and private sector concerns . This year 's appropriation is $16 million and supports interinstitutional cooperation projects , community college and four-year institution articulation enters , economic development activities , and minority achievement programs . Funds are awarded through a competitive grant application process . <p> State requirements often hinder the realization of desirable contractual arrangements between state agencies such as community colleges and entities not governed by the state . For example , at Truckee Meadows Community College , the University of Nevada System governs the college . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations . However , these formulas have not been structured to accommodate leased space , such as that the college had arranged to satisfy a need for space . As a result , the college had to find nonbudgeted money for maintenance and operations from within its existing resources for the first year of the leasing agreement . <p> Another interesting catch-22 in California , and probably in other states as well , is that , " with rare exceptions , districts are permitted to add only as much space as they have been able to justify through enrollment projections . If a district wishes to purchase a building that exceeds that space , it usually may not do so even if the building is cheaper than a smaller one built from scratch italics added " ( BW Associates , 1992a , p. 6 ) . <p> Long-term planning requirements versus the need for flexibility . Virtually all states require long-term , detailed facilities planning processes as prerequisites to funding of new community college facilities . For example , every Florida community college is required , at least every five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey provides the foundation for a three-year plan required by the Florida State Board of Education . The plan is the basis for the Board 's annual capital outlay budget request to the legislature ( Bullock , Fart , &; Wright , 1994 ) . Decreasing resources mean that colleges have an increasing need for flexibility ; they must be able to take advantage of collaborative opportunities for building , sharing , or leasing facilities . Revising policies and procedures to permit or encourage fiscally responsible , collaborative facilities arrangements would give colleges the flexibility they need to take advantage of collaborative opportunities . In fact , long-term , detailed planning may currently be a less valuable use of staff time than making a concerted effort to develop effective negotiating abilities . <p> In California , as of 1992 , it took at least 37 months for district facilities plans to be approved and funded . Five different state agencies were involved in the process . As much as 10 years could pass between the origination of the proposal and the completion of the facility . Easing the current restrictions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities could speed up the process ( BW Associates , 1992a , p. 1 ) . Facilities that take up to 10 years to bring on-line may be outdated and may no longer match specific capacity or other needs . Furthermore , building owners , anxious to complete transactions , are often unwilling to wait for time-consuming state processes . Special concerns about earthquake safety standards ( the Field Act ) further complicate matters in California , apparently making it " nearly impossible for districts to purchase existing commercial or industrial buildings , although such purchases could at times realize considerable savings " ( BW Associates , 1992a , p. ii ) . <p> College organizational , perspective , and change issues . Community college administrators are often hesitant to approach nontraditional arrangements . As Mawby ( 1992 , p. 24 ) noted , community colleges need to " fight the tendency to become institutionalized . " He went on to relate Gardner 's ( 1981 , p. 3 ) observation that , <p> When organizations and societies are young , they are flexible , fluid , not yet paralyzed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the organization or society ages , vitality diminishes , flexibility gives way to rigidity , creativity fades and there is a loss of capacity to meet challenges from unexpected directions . Most American community colleges are more than 25 years old  --  perhaps not yet accurately described as middle-aged  --  but filled , nonetheless , with tradition and with staff members with many years of tenure . <p> Particularly for larger institutions , or for a group of colleges in a region , it may be valuable to consider developing a unit or office devoted to considering and coordinating community college partnerships . The Dallas County Community College District ( DCCCD ) created an Educational Partnerships Office in 1992 " to develop partnership opportunities with external entities , to identify delivery partners within the colleges , and to assist in the implementation of pilot or model programs " ( Wenrich &; Hughes , 1995 ) . One major objective of the office is to facilitate communication by serving as a central contact point for the institution ; another is to facilitate economies of scale where possible ; and a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique or nontraditional activities . <p> New roles for community college foundations . One approach to developing and managing shared facilities is through a college foundation . Dr. Robert Westrick of Lake-Sumter Community College ( Florida ) suggested accepting " donations of real property ( land and/or building ) located in blighted areas through the college foundation  --  with the understanding that the donor will permit immediate resale " ( Donaldson &; Smith , 1994 , p. 6 ) . He further noted that proceeds of such transactions could also qualify for matching dollars in some states . Many community colleges do not yet have a chartered foundation that could serve as the owner of such property on behalf of the college . Such a foundation could become the appropriate vehicle for cultivating and coordinating facilities partnerships . Moreover , foundation trustees and executives could establish positive relationships with important members of the community who are potential contributors or facilitators . Conclusions <p> L. Edwin Coate , Vice Chancellor for Business and Administration at the University of California at Santa Cruz noted that , " You have to start with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to assume that you have a mess you do n't even know about " ( Klinger , 1994 , p. 34 ) . Long-term , comprehensive planning is one process that could benefit from some new strategies . Collaborative arrangements with other organizations to develop needed facilities offer some advantages that planners should consider . Sharing a facility usually costs less than funding and maintaining separate facilities ; and shared facilities can provide access to a valuable location that is otherwise unavailable . They also can provide access to special physical resource needs such as adequate parking or expensive recreational facilities or libraries . Shared facilities other than classrooms , such as cafeterias or bookstores , can ensure adequate customer markets . Moreover , shared facilities can offer multiple services to students or clients who would otherwise find the need to visit two or more different facilities . In some circumstances , each partner can use the shared facility at a different " prime time , " which means more efficient use of a resource . Finally , collaborative arrangements can instigate mutual learning and support when partner organizations commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint-use facilities can allow colleges to use resources more effectively , they can be difficult to manage . The cost of the time involved in coordinating the facility 's management must be considered . Research should be conducted into how shared facilities are coordinated and financed . Such research could help to guide community college educators as they consider developing and managing shared facilities with other organizations . <p> The problem of increasing competition for shrinking resources is here to stay . Exploring collaborative facilities development opportunities can provide community colleges with effective , economical alternatives . A broad range of opportunities appear to be available , but community college leaders must emphasize developing collaboration skills of all types and encourage an active willingness to explore creative possibilities . <p>
