<p> The " new male . " Is n't he just what every woman wanted ? A caring , sensitive guy in touch with his feelings ? Not the man who merely picked up a dish towel , but the guy who brought a woman his innermost core ? <p> Don Williams tried to be that new man - and it did n't work . Now divorced , Williams says women who said in the ' 70s and ' 80s " they wanted ' new males ' are now in the ' 90s turning around and divorcing us . " They are still drawn " to the old male stereotype . Women basically do n't know what they want , " protests Williams , 44 , Augusta , Maine . <p> The new male is still celebrated in 1,000 local men 's groups around the country . The open and emotive guy searches for his soul in poet Robert Bly 's new book Iron John : A Book About Men ( Addison-Wesley , $ 18.95 ) . And he continues to call USA TODAY relationship hot lines with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he really in favor ? Do women know what to do with him when he arrives ? <p> As men search to balance machismo and sensitivity , both women and men seem confused by just how touchy-feely the ' 90s man should be : <p> - Janet Fulton votes for super sensitivity - her husband , Roger , is the all-time sensitive male . " Roger has always been very upfront . He will cry with me . And I think it 's wonderful , " says Fulton , 48 , Tucson , Ariz , who has known Roger 30 years . <p> After six months of marriage , she observes , " I love his sensitivity . He draws me out and that is invigorating . " But she adds a caveat for unsuspecting women : " I also find it exhausting . It is work to be in that type of relationship . " <p> - Virginia Gavin does n't hesitate to use the " w " words - wimp , weak , wishy-washy . She is married to a sensitive-macho guy , but has been involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiring . They can be clinging , boring and confining , " says Gavin , 27 , Beltsville , Md . " Someone who leaves you no space . I like sensitivity - but you want that balance with the traditional male who can make you angry . " <p> - Carlton Stuart Patton says he was brought up to be strong but caring . " Women say they are forever looking for sensitivity , " says Patton , 29 , Dallas . " But a lot of women do n't know how to accept it . " <p> - Altheda Anduze emphasizes ' 90s men should be both caring and strong - like her husband , James Thompson Jr . He is a criminal investigator who writes poetry . " He is no wimp , " says newlywed Anduze , 32 , Dallas . " He is strong physically and in his character . But some women  --  are looking for someone who is very sensitive . And when they find him , he is just not strong . " <p> Confused women are giving men double messages , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's woman is telling her man to open up . And when he does , she does not know how to react . " Her own dad may have been aloof and traditional , leaving her with few role models , says Druck , author of The Secrets Men Keep , ( Ballantine , $ 3.95 ) . And " when the sensitive male shows his insecurities , his fears , she does not like what she sees . " <p> Sometimes she will call him a wimp . " The word has become a caricature to describe the indecisive , ambivalent male , the man who walks on egg shells and really is afraid to say how he feels . <p> " This is a man who has overreacted to changing times , to taking cues from women . He may give up his own power to a woman , thinking that is what she wants . " But she will lose interest very quickly , Druck says . <p> Sensitivity and emotionalism do not equate with wimp-ism , sensitive men emphasize . Some women agree . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few , and I have not found one to be wimpy , " says Sandra Richardson , 39 , Columbus , Ohio . She recalls , " I dated this one man five years . We 'd cry at the movies together , and he was never ashamed or embarrassed . And another guy was huge , a bear of a man , very macho-looking . And he was very sensitive . " <p> Richardson adds that sensitivity is not gender-related . " A sensitive person is one who can share feelings - a man or a woman . I am like that . And it ca n't be one-sided in a relationship . There has to be give and take to have it work . " <p> Roger Fulton , 50 , says he 's " anything but wimpy . I like the super-macho things , " says Fulton , the manager of a Tuscon air freight terminal . <p> Yet , he says , " There is nobody more emotional than I am . " During his dating years , " I thought women liked emotive men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with that . One woman actually asked me if I was for real . " <p> Matthew Witten , a computer specialist for 12 branches of the University of Texas , says he has no hesitation about crying in front of his three daughters , ages 5-13 . " There is no shame in caring , loving , crying , " says Witten , 39 , of Austin . " Those are not the ' feminine side . ' They are just a facet of the whole . Without them , I think you can get a little nuts . " <p> Patton adds , " Sensitive men are n't wimps . When you 're sensitive , you 're laid back ; you can go along with things . You may be somewhat opinionated , though . And you 're self-confident . That goes with sensitivity . " <p> A sensitive man without self-confidence will turn a woman off sexually , cautions Herb Goldberg , author of Inner Male ( Signet , $ 4.95 ) . He is not seen as having the " successful , goal-oriented , aggressive focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak , he will not excite her . " <p> Women do find caring , new males boring , Don Williams says - but for other reasons . " For a woman who was raised around self-centered ' old male ' types , life was never boring . There was always conflict . " <p> Women 's penchant for " old male " types , he says , " really came home when I found out my ex-wife is going to marry a guy who likes fast cars , and motorcycles . " <p> Women shopping this season for sensitive guys should keep a few basics in mind , Goldberg says . He suggests a woman look for balance . She should ask herself : <p> - Do you know him well enough ? " Is his sensitivity part of a balanced personality , or does it come at the expense of a clear , goal-oriented focus ? You may come to resent his sensitive style if it is out of balance . " <p> - Are you assertive and able to make decisions yourself ? " If you are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who may be less aggressive . " <p> - Are you attracted to him after being hurt by an insensitive partner ? " Initially you will then see the sensitive man as the perfect partner . But you may become disillusioned . " <p> The key is balance , agrees Michael Lafavore , editor of Men 's Health magazine . " Men are trying to blend the different aspects of their personalities . They are more comfortable being sensitive than they used to be . But they still want to hang onto their traditional ways . " <p> Women today want both qualities , Janet Fulton agrees . " Women do not want to go back to the macho idiot who is all-demanding . They do want a sensitive man . " But she still cautions , " When they get him , he makes some women uncomfortable . " CUTLINE : CARING AND SHARING : Janet Fulton has a happy marriage with sensitive husband Roger . But , ' I also find it exhausting . '
