<p> EXCEPT for oiling the door lock now and then , Chan Kan does n't have many household chores . For the past quarter century the retired factory worker has lived with all her belongings in an iron cage that is 6 feet long , 4 feet high , and about 3 feet wide . <p> " It 's affordable , " Chan Kan says as she shuffles down a narrow aisle between cages stacked to the ceiling in a dark and dilapidated room . <p> " At first I lived in the top bunk , then in the middle one , and now here on the bottom , " she says , stopping at the container she rents for $32 a month . <p> Some 4,000 poor , elderly men and women live in the segregated , cage-like dwellings , euphemistically called " bedspace apartments " by the British colonial government , but known among social workers as " Hong Kong 's blight " or in Cantonese , " black stains . " <p> The notorious hostels symbolize a Dickensian side of this laissez-faire society that persists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 years of remarkable economic growth among Hong Kong 's 5.7 million people . <p> Built in the 1940s and ' 50s to lodge a flood of migrants from war-torn China , about 200 of the bunkhouses remain in old , inner-city districts like Kowloon City and Mongkok . Privately owned , they are run by middlemen who skim profits off the monthly rent of $26 to $38 . <p> Scores and sometimes up to 100 people cram into single rooms on the upper floors of the tenements . Sweltering in summer , the rooms have poor ventilation , filthy sanitation , and no elevators . In Mongkok , where Chan Kan lives , a survey of the hostels showed that an average of 40 people shared each toilet . <p> Hazards in the buildings are extreme , with many lacking fire escapes and firefighting gear . Last December , a three-hour blaze in one tenement killed six people and injured 50 . Panicked residents fled to the roof , and too many crowded onto a cherry picker , causing it to collapse down several floors . <p> The widely publicized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apathy toward the hostels . The abject penury makes " a mockery " of the colony , which boasts a vibrant , export economy and the world 's second-largest public-housing scheme , critics said . <p> The Legislative Council , Hong Kong 's mainly appointed parliament , voted last month to urge the government to move swiftly to eradicate the " appalling " and inhuman abodes . <p> " These people are left out of the safety net , and we want to rope them in , " says legislator Maria Tam , who led the action . <p> But the government confronts a dilemma : Many of the inhabitants are reluctant to move out . <p> " They stay as long as they can climb up and down the stairs , " says Lisa Leung , a social worker at the Mongkok Kaifong Welfare Association , which has persuaded only three people to leave their cages during the past three years . <p> Social workers say the higher rents of other available housing units are only part of the problem . Equally important are the traditional Chinese traits of industriousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salient , matters of social status or " face . " <p> Most of the inhabitants are men in their 50s and 60s who migrated to Hong Kong from southern China over the past 40 years . Of the women , many took vows of celibacy according to the custom in some southern Chinese villages earlier this century . <p> " It was a rule in our village when I was young that if a woman had the ability to earn a living she should not marry . It gave her higher status , " says Miss Ng Szu , an 80-year-old hostel resident who came to Hong Kong from Shunde , Guangdong Province , 40 years ago . <p> A pressing goal for many migrants was to earn enough to support parents , wives , and children left behind in China . <p> Illiterate or with only primary school education , they took jobs as " coolies " in Hong Kong garment factories , docks , and tea shops . They ate cheap salted fish and vegetables from hawkers ' stalls . Those forced to retire took up odd jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tenants saw the cages as temporary , a place to sleep , another hardship to be endured as they saved every cent for the family and clan . <p> Chan Yin , a retired plastics-factory worker , still spends most of her savings to support her daughter and other relatives in China , bringing them gifts of clothing , sweets , and medicine on trips home twice a year . <p> With the gifts she gains " face , " a sense of worth , and even a feeling of superiority as she compares herself not with other Hong Kong residents but with her mainland kin . <p> " Their conditions are much more difficult than mine , " says Chan Yin , 77 , who lived in a cage in Mongkok for 28 years . Last year , Chan Yin converted three stacked cages into a tiny cubicle in the corner of the room . <p> Many cage dwellers retain the identity of tranients . Men especially cling to the idea that one day they will return to China , where the relatives they have supported will care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them , " Ms. Leung says . <p> Social workers say the " caged people " reject shared public housing or care homes because these represent a loss of independence , new obligations , and permanence . Public housing is far from the neighborhood hawkers and sympathetic employers on whom the lodgers rely . <p> Aware of these problems , Peter Tsao , Hong Kong secretary for home affairs , last month announced a three-pronged plan to relieve overcrowding in " bedspace apartments " by cutting the number of inhabitants in half . <p> Under the plan , $7 million in donations will be used to resettle 1,000 residents who depend on welfare in nearby , renovated buildings . Voluntary agencies will run the new hostels . Another 1,000 of those with modest incomes will be persuaded to move into public housing . <p> But social workers and legislators worry that despite government assurances , the plan could lead to an increase in homelessness , since all the 4,000 lodgers - whose average income is $300 a month - will face higher rents . <p> They also argue that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the breakdown of the traditional family are likely to worsen the housing problem for Hong Kong 's elderly singles in coming years , they warn . <p> " We want to make sure people moved out are not left in the streets , " Ms. Tam says .
