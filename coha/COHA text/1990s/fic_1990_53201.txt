Mr. Lee , as he transferred chicken feed from the large bin to his everyday pitcher , noticed how the dust rose from the seeds , how steam rises from a landscape , cold , or hot from a white cup of cafe con leche , how smoke rises from a casual backyard fire , how a soul is given up from a sick man . He did not take meaning from this , it was not instruction to him . He simply saw it . <p> However , when the soldiers came , he had wished possession of that capability , of effecting a rising beyond his own body , of leaving it for them to take , and thereby not feeling what they would do to him , which was unimaginable . <p> He saw the moment of his imagined escape everywhere , in everything , in the rising of smoke from a cigarette , in a flock of sparrows taking flight . Even , he thought , in the sound of a song let go from the mouth , a whistled aria . That a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds . <p> He wished it equally for all of them , but his wish did not work very well . The soldiers rounded up all the Chinese they could find , in a day and a night , without warning or manners , without explanation , by neighbor 's direction and by rumor and by store sign . Who could have thought this is what would happen , said the townspeople afterward . <p> But a soldier is a soldier , and who could say no to a soldier 's voice . A brown suit like that takes a man , and turns him into his parts . He is nobody 's son anymore . <p> They are always there , without birth and without death , these soldiers . Nobody could say where a soldier comes from . Or who his teachers are , or what they must look like . Where are manners such that a loud step , a stiff neck , a salute in place of the rightful shaking of a hand , are marks of grace . Without the hand offered , where is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what another has been through by the feeling of roughness in his palm . <p> Mr. Lee was married with his body and in his heart for a thousand years to Jesusita , married because of , he would shrug his shoulders , who can say . It was like the workings , the intestines , of an opera , he would suggest , and were they not , the two of them , worthy singers in the plot . She would shake her head at him and say she did not understand . <p> But she did . Not in the way he said it , but she understood in some other way , in the words spoken by his face , clearly what he said . <p> Mr. Lee was glad that she herself was not Chinese , today . He was glad that she did not look like she needed to be taken away to the trains . He was glad that she did not look like she could profit from a stay in the place where the train would go . Wherever that was , and whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tracks . <p> And Mr. Lee was glad that his daughters looked like their mother . That he had not given them on their faces a ticket for the train , had not attached it to them so that they would not lose it , the way one might pin a child 's mitten to his jacket . In that way , he was happy not to have been able to provide for them . To have been an unfit father , only in this way . Only today . <p> The Twenties were over now and things had seemed to be getting better , the Revolution , the Depression : it was all over . But to climb out of something like that a country has to grab a hold of something else , some foothold to lift itself , something to step on . That is what this new decade was for , and that is what the Chinese were for , said the president . <p> Like Mr. Lee , he had said this not in regular words , but with some other part of himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nights happen as one would imagine : the president gets indigestion after a meal of bad fish and spoiled butter , a suspect wheel of cheese . He tries to do something , he tries the carbonating powders . <p> And more . In pain he orders the arrest of all Chinese in the country and their deportation back to China . Who would complain , after all , or who would complain any louder than anyone else , since there were so many voices of complaint for so many things . <p> It could have been someone else , the Germans , or the Americans , but what was the use . People thought the Chinese were beginning to own everything , and there were just enough of them . In truth , it was that their store signs stood out so much , and their faces . In truth , which everybody knew , there were many other choices , but this one was the quickest . <p> There were the people in Alamos , for example , who lived next to the great silver mine . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver everything , silver broom covers , brooms themselves made of silver , and silver on the pillars holding up their houses . Anything to which silver might be added was fashionable there . <p> But to get them to give it up , well , it was a different thing . <p> His four daughters cried when they heard what was happening , and cried when they heard the soldiers getting closer . But Jesusita did what she could . <p> In those days the family lived in Los Apostoles , twelve row houses , or rather , twelve row rooms , owned by Don Lazaro , who did not worry about things very much , and who when asked said that he most certainly did not rent to the Chinese . With what he charged , he said , one could hardly call it rent . <p> That there were twelve apartments gave rise to both the humor of the name and the mathematics of a problem . Since they were all built at once and were identical , if one problem arose , there were as if by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Don Lazaro , who did not always put much stock in the laws of multiplication . <p> Through the years , each of these quarters began to take on an individual aspect , as Don Lazaro approached each problem as something different from the one before and the one after . He did not , after all , want to insult anyone by not giving them the consideration of listening to their particular problem . Nor , for that matter , did he wish to offend them by turning down a cafe con leche as he listened . He was a good listener , and sometimes he would offer to boil the milk for the second cup of coffee . And he gave each problem its own solution . <p> But at very least , twelve similar-looking yards occupied the space behind these apartments , each with a small fence , or some such barrier . And those who knew their own yard knew their neighbor 's . <p> It was night by now , and as the soldiers came and knocked at the first house , Jesusita took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the soldiers knocked in sequence , as only soldiers with their peculiar efficiency would do . <p> There were enough garbage cans and compost heaps , enough odd noises by dogs disturbed and grizzled cats , that Jesusita was able to move her husband with some ease . Not the least reason was the irregular rule of geometry , which stated that a small garbage heap was a large mountain to a lazy man . These soldiers were tired already from so much work in the afternoon , and without respite . <p> The seven soldiers in the vicinity did not equal one mother calling her child to dinner here . A mother knows how to find a child . <p> When the soldiers reached the last apartment , Jesusita , who had said she was bringing in laundry , brought her husband back to their rooms , and in through the back door . <p> His four daughters had said when the soldiers knocked that he was not there , and had not been there for some time , and that they did not know where he was or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It figures , the lieutenant , or the captain , or whatever he was , had said , these Chinese , after all . He had a deep voice , too loud . <p> The daughters said nothing and went about their business , and at that cue the soldier harrumphed and did the same , saying something vague , If you see him , well , you know then , call us , and the daughters replied also with something vague , Of course , all right , then . <p> When they left , Jesusita brought her husband in and they all helped to hide him inside the cabinet of the radio , a Ward 's " Airline " model , with the word Heterodyne underneath . It was a brown piece of furniture , part Greek columns and part lyre in decoration . Before they moved the radio back against the wall , they all looked at him , with the radio tubes and wires all above his head . <p> He looked like something from the movies , something from a Saturday morning , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And they heard him say , This can not be happening . And as they looked at him , they saw that he was right . This was not like doing the laundry or preparing the evening meal . This was nothing they knew . This was after all something from the movies . But it was as if the manager had locked the doors of the theater , and they had to live with this beast . <p> No one saw Mr. Lee for many years . He did not live here anymore , his family said . But they were not sad . He lived in between the bed sheets and in the bathroom . He fit into the small spaces of the house , and did not eat much . <p> The soldiers never came back to look for him , but then again there was nothing to look for . Everyone in the town knew that he had disappeared . A pity , they would say , que lastima . He was such smart man . <p> But times changed , and every now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised . They understood something of how a thing could happen and not happen . There had been nothing in the newspapers or on the radio about that singular night . They understood how Mr. Lee could be gone and still be here . There was no mystery in seeing something that did not exist . The government had taught them well , and they were good citizens . There were , they knew , many kinds of ghosts . <p> The rounding up of the Chinese lasted only the one night , as long as the president 's heartburn . They loaded them , as people later told one another even in public , into boxcars and open cattle and cotton cars . All over the country the soldiers looked , but especially along the border , where they might have been heard , so many voices , such a different language . <p> Many of the wives who had grown up in this town went with their men , to live in China . They took their children , too , and something or other in their arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . They were not treated well . But such a thing was not a new life , and they were used to it . Being treated well was not much of a measure for anything anymore . <p> Not all of the Chinese left , however , and Mr. Lee was not the only one to be hidden . Some men had been dressed like women , and like animals , which was a gypsy trick . And none of them was seen for many years . There was a yipping at the moon some nights during this time , recognizable as coyotes in any other decade , but some townspeople said it was the Chinese . By this they did not mean that they were still in the animal disguises they had worn , but , rather , it was a remark about the quality of voice they heard . <p> It was a sound reminiscent of the German man , Mr. Luder , whose wife Margarita had died in childbirth along with the child . In the daytime he had a business in clocks , something regular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and child , and he wept . <p> The business later failed , and all he could do was to sleep on that stone and dirt , or walk around the town getting ready to sleep . This walking toward sleep became his job . People , in fact , had sometimes heard Mr. Luder 's sobbing , and thought it was coyotes , and later the sounds of the Chinese . It was a sound many animals shared . <p> Some time later , as many Chinese had made their way up into Arizona , some of them would be mistaken again , this time for Japanese , and taken away once more . But they were returned . Again without the courtesy of manners . <p> When the government later rounded up the Yaqui Indians , they did it the other way around . They could not capture the men . But the women and children who came down from the mountains to trade goods were easy enough to take . <p> This time they put the women in trains , the old trick of how to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . Traveling was dangerous then , as the Yaquis took up the attacking of all the trains in the region . The Yaquis , many people said , were vicious . <p> Mr. Lee , the townspeople remarked regularly , was very smart , but by smart they meant a great deal more , which they could not say . He was rumored not so much to be Chinese , but to have had a gypsy father himself , who had shown him the ways of other worlds , who had given him the singular ability to live well in a radio . By now they had heard the story of that night from Jesusita . In our radio , she said to them , looking like a Martian . <p> Everyone had laughed when Jesusita told the story , but not too hard . Of course , they thought , with a look each to the other . Of course . He was not , after all , of this place . <p> When he walked along the path between the black walnut trees lining the streets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That the government had not been able to take him , no matter what the law . That he , because of his head that lit up with tubes , knew something more than the law . <p> They laughed , but not too hard , and they called on him for advice when they were in trouble , because he would understand . They were a little scared of him , of course , because he knew something about things . He knew the underbelly and the tomorrow and yesterday of things , he knew their opposites and their half-turns . He knew the radio , after all , from the inside out . <p> He was like Mr. Luder , they sometimes said . He knew about life . He knew about it as if he had walked the perimeter of a park , and thereby gauged something of the dimensions of a neat lawn and the heights of the eucalyptus trees . <p> And his pronunciation of words , unlike the laws of the presidents , never changed , a little stilted even after so many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their language better than they did , that he spoke correctly . There was something wrong in this place and in these days , and they heard it in Mr. Lee 's accent . He would talk , strangelike , and they knew he was right , about anything , about the weather . <p> The wedder , he would say , and they would understand . And when he smoked , they would think they sometimes saw him in the cloud . <p> <p> By Alberto Alvaro Rios <p>
