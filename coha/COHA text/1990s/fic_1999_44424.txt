Who says money does n't grow on trees ? What are you getting Pete for his birthday ? " my older sister Betsy asked . Pete was my younger brother . He was going to be 5 years old and I had n't gotten him a thing . " I 'm still thinking about it , " I answered , as I wedged my hand between the couch cushions . " You are not thinking , " Betsy shot back . " You are couch fishing for change because you 're broke . " " I 've got plenty of cash , " I lied , my fingers desperately clawing the mysterious spaces within the couch . " You spend all your money on yourself , " she said , reading my mind . I had just spent most of my cash on a Mo Vaughn baseball card . " Aha ! " I shouted , and pulled an old penny out of the crack . " Now I 've got something for Pete . " I held the penny up for her to see . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without the slightest idea how it might do so . But I kept talking . " You do n't need a lot of cash to give a great gift . " I rapped my knuckles against my head . " You just need a generous imagination . " " That 's just another way of saying you are cheap ! " she said , sneering . " Just you wait , " I snapped back . " With this one penny I will steal the birthday gift-giving show . " " Put your money where your mouth is , " she said . " I bet ten bucks that 's a thousand pennies - that my gift will be his favorate . " " You 're on , " I replied , thinking that I did need a " generous imagination . " After dinner , Mom brought out the birthday cake . She lit the five candles and said to Pete , " Make a wish . " Pete 's eyes rolled up toward the ceiling as he sucked up a whole roomful of air into his lungs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what hit them . In a split second there was nothing left but five vanishing trails of smoke . " OK , " Pete announced , grinning . " I 'm ready to open presents . " Mom and Dad lifted a big box onto the table . Small hockey players skated across the wrapping paper . Pete ripped it open with one swipe and lifted the top on the box . There were a set of roller blades and elbow and knee pads and an orange street-hockey ball . " Awesome , " Pete shrieked , and threw his arms around Mom and Dad . " Thank you , " he said , then suddenly he turned toward Betsy . " Next , " he said . She took him to the back window and pulled the curtain aside . I looked over Pete 's shoulder . On the lawn was a hockey net , and a regulation hockey stick , and a goalie 's stick . " You are the best sister on the planet , " he said and gave her a hug . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The heat was on . I suppose if I had n't spent all my money on my card collection I would be giving him a hockey helmet and a pair of regulation leather hockey gloves or something that would fit the gift-giving theme . Still , I did n't lose faith in my " generous imagination . " " So , " Betsy cut in with her smarmy voice . " What did you get Pete ? " I reached into my shirt pocket and removed a small envelope . On the front of it I had drawn a tree covered with tiny pennies . Under the drawing I had written : ONE PENNY TREE SEED . I handed it to him . He opened the metal clasp and shook out the single penny and a piece of paper with planting instructions . He looked suspiciously at the penny , then back at me . Then Mom and Dad and Betsy stared at me . They did not seem pleased with my choice of gifts . I snatched the planting directions out of his hand . " It reads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a penny tree grows . " " " Will it actually grow ? " he asked . " Oh , yeah , " I shot back . " Absolutely . It 's guaranteed . Says so right on the directions . " " Wow ! " he shouted . " This is the best gift ever . When the tree grows I 'll have enough pennies to buy an entire ice-skating rink . " " Sure you will , " I said with my " generous imagination " getting away from me . " You could even buy the Boston Bruins . " Pete ran out the back door to go plant his seed . " Jack , " Mom said . " I hope you have n't started something you will regret . Your brother believes everything you say , so do n't you dare let him down . " " Do n't worry , " I said . " It 's under control . " As soon as she was out of the room I turned to Betsy and stuck out my hand . " That will be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woke before I did . When I got up , I peeked out the kitchen window . There he was , watering his seed . I smiled to myself as I poured milk on my cereal . What an incredible gift , I thought . This was definitely the smartest thing I had ever cooked up . It only cost me one free cent , and on top of it I made a thousand more from Betsy . I felt like a genius . As I ate , I began to imagine what baseball card I 'd buy next . When Pete came in , he was excited . " I think it is growing already , " he said . " Could be , " I replied . " Just remember , water it six times per day or else it will shrivel up and die . " I figured he 'd never be able to keep up the six-times-per-day schedule , and sooner or later I 'd have to announce the demise of the penny tree . And I would be blameless . It was perfect . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was bigger than mine was when he came running up to me holding the windup alarm clock in his outstretched hands . " How many hours apart is it if I water six times per day ? " he asked . I did the math in my head . " Four , " I replied . " Then set this for four hours from now , " he said . I did . When I handed it back to him , he grabbed his little red chair and went outside . When I looked out the window again , he was sitting in his chair , reading a book with the alarm clock on his lap and the watering can to his side . Cute , I thought . Very cute . I should take a picture . " Where 's Pete ? " Mom asked . " We have to go to the store and exchange his roller blades for a different size . " " Out back , " I said , and pointed toward the window . She looked out . " Oh , that is precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious . " Jack , you know your brother still believes in Santa Claus , the Easter Bunny , and the Tooth Fairy . It would be awful of you to burst his bubble . " " He 's a little brother , " I said . " It 's a law that older brothers have to burst the bubbles of little brothers . " " Just do n't hurt him , " she warned me . " Or , there is a parent 's law that says there might be consequences . " That was her favorite warning , " There might be consequences . " This always got my " generous imagination " worked up . Usually I pictured myself wrapped in chains and handcuffed to a post in our spider-filled basement . That night the alarm went off at midnight , and again at four in the morning . Each time Pete hopped out of bed , turned on his flashlight , and ran outside to water his penny tree . By morning , I was beginning to feel the " consequences " creeping up on me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine , and I kept my mouth shut . That night we were sitting in the living room , reading . Pete pulled out his old copy of The Carrot Seed . He read it over and over . " This is the greatest book ever , " he shouted . " The little boy plants a carrot seed and waters it and waters it , and even though everyone in his family says it wo n't grow he still waters it because he believes it will . And then , boom , overnight it grows into a giant carrot . That 's just how it is going to be with my penny tree - because I believe in it ! " I peeked over the top of my book . Mom , Dad , and Betsy were peeking up over their books , too - and they were glaring at me . I smiled at them . They did n't smile back . Suddenly , I was beginning to feel bad about myself . Maybe I had gone too far . Maybe Pete was too delicate for my scheme . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and put my book down . I ran to the garage and got a garden spade . Then I went over to the neighbor 's yard and dug up a plant that sort of looked like a little tree . Then I replanted it where Pete had planted his seed . I sneaked back into my bedroom and got a handful of pennies and some tape , then went back outside . Quickly , I taped a few pennies on the branches . " This will make him happy , " I said to myself , " and then we can forget about the penny tree . " The next morning , Pete woke me up by jumping up and down on my bed and shouting . " It grew ! It grew ! I 'm rich . Come see ! " I hopped up and followed him outside . " Wow , " I said , and made my eyes get real big . " It worked . " He bent down and held one in his hands . " Why are they held on with tape ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " Those are penny stems . " " Cool , " he said . Then he asked a question that I gave the wrong answer to . " If I leave them on the tree will they grow really big , like huge penny hubcaps ? " " Nah , " I replied , " they 'll turn into nickels . " Pete 's eyes bugged out . " Nickels ! " he shouted . " Then I 'll wait to pick them . " Oh , no ! I thought . I did it again . Everything went downhill fast from there . And the more broke I became , the happier everyone else was . First , I had to sneak out in the middle of the night and change the pennies to nickels . And of course Pete was thrilled . When he saw them , he danced a little dance around the yard and then announced that he would wait for them to become dimes . Once again , I dug into my piggy bank and got dimes , and later sneaked out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete went nuts . He did somersaults across the yard and drooled all over himself . Then he decided to hold out for quarters . That night , I changed the dimes to quarters . The next day Pete went screaming wildly around the backyard until he was so dizzy he fell over and announced he would wait for 50-cent pieces . That night I did the changeover . The next day , he was bonkers . I tried to get him to pluck the half-dollars off the tree , but no , he was holding out for the dollar bills . That night , I taped 10 single dollar bills all over the tree , and when I finished I said to myself , " OK , this madness has got to stop . I started it , so I 'll finish it . " I took a small pair of scissors and cut off all the leaves from the tree and left them scattered under the tiny branches . The next morning , Pete and I got up together to water the tree . On the way out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar bills there will be five-dollar bills , then tens , then twenties , then hundreds . . . " I stopped him . " Do n't count your chickens before they hatch , " I warned him . When we arrived at the tree , Pete gasped and dropped to his knees . " It died ! " he shouted . " All its leaves fell off . " He began to cry . " But dollar bills are still left on the bare branches , " I pointed out . " Why 'd it die ? " he blubbered . " I loved this tree . " " It 's not dead , " I said , putting my arm around his shoulders . " It 's just that winter is coming . The penny tree has a short growing season . You know , like apples and pears . " Pete wiped his eyes on his sleeve . Then he thought about what I said . He thought about it for so long that I knew I was in trouble . " You mean it will return next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course it will . " " That is so cool ! " he shouted . " I 'll be rich all over again . " He was ripping the dollar bills off the tree as I stood up and slowly walked back to my room . I shook my piggy bank . It was empty . I better start saving now , I thought . That kid 's " generous imagination " is going to cost me every cent I can get my hands on . Lesson 4 Fiction The Penny Tree SUMMARY Caught without a gift on the eve of his little brother 's birthday , Jack cooks up a brilliant scheme . He gives his brother a penny which , he promises , is actually a seed to a penny tree . The tricky plan works , until Jack realizes that his conscience wo n't allow him to let his little brother 's trust and excitement wither on the vine . DURING READING Discussion/Predicting : Pause at the bottom of page 20 and ask students what they think of the main character , Jack , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it ? Do they want him to ? AFTER READING Discussion/Character : Younger students in particular might have trouble deciding whether Jack is a " good guy " or a " bad guy . " He selfishly spends all his money on himself , forgets his brother 's birthday , and then devises a sneaky scheme rather than owning up to his mistakes . On the other hand , Jack shows many admirable qualities and , in the end , he goes to great lengths to insure that Pete is n't disappointed . Do Jack 's weaknesses make him a more or less interesting character ? Do his mistakes make him " bad " or merely human ? Does he learn his lesson in the end ? Ask students to think of other characters from their favorite books who are less than perfect , characters whose complexities make them more believable and interesting to read about ( e.g. Beverly Cleary 's Ramona ) . Idioms : Students might not be familiar with the term " Do n't count your chickens before they hatch " ( page 23 ) . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  commonly used expressions or phrases that mean something different from what they appear to mean . You might explain that virtually every culture has these expressions that often express a folksy sort of wisdom . Ask students if they have heard the following expressions : A stitch in time saves nine ( save time by doing a job carefully ) ; Do n't put all your eggs in one basket ( hedge your bets ) ; Do n't let the cat out of the bag ( do n't tell a secret ) ; Kill two birds with one stone ( achieve two objectives in one stroke ) ; Big for his britches ( conceited ) . Write these and others on the board and have fun with students as they try to decipher their meanings . Main Conflict : On standardized tests , students are often asked to identify the central conflict of a story . Explain that all stories have a conflict  --  which does not mean a fight , but rather a central problem which somehow gets solved in the story .

Ask students to read the sentences above out loud and then read the following sentences that appear in the story : " Pete 's eyes rolled up toward the ceiling as he sucked up a whole roomful of air into his lungs . The five little flames did n't know what hit them . In a split second there was nothing left but five vanishing trails of smoke .

" When I was in fifth grade , I really tried pulling this cheapo stunt with my younger brother , " Jack told us .
