<p> IT 'S NO MYSTERY why a city as buttoned-up as Washington connects with music as down-home as bluegrass  --  it gets us back to ourselves . Anyone interested in tracking the sound a little closer to its source need only travel to the southwestern Virginia town of Floyd . Every Friday night , players , listeners and dancers come from all around to gather at Freeman and Helen Cockram 's general store for the Friday Nite Jamboree . <p> The evening begins quietly around 6:30 , as white-haired ladies and gentlemen croon and pick hymns . Then Freeman reads the prayer list , made up of neighbors who are having some kind of trouble , and those who feel inclined are led in a prayer right then and there . <p> Then , oh then , come the bluegrass boys , walking to the stage with a certain seriousness , for the time to tear loose will come soon enough . Suddenly the air is a yelp of banjos , fiddles and acoustic guitars . Singers put their heads together in high , tight harmonies and men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just ca n't help it . <p> It 's not long before the flatfooters come gliding onto the floor . If you 're sitting in the back and can see only the straight upper bodies , it 's easy to imagine that not a whole lot is going on . But look down and you 'll see the knees pumping , some of them double-time , and the feet kicking and slipping and sliding so fast and so many different ways you wonder that all the legs do n't just wrap around each other and bring everybody down . <p> A tall man with toe and heel clackers on his white shoes is dancing with his wife , his son ( who has white shoes , clackers and a sweat towel just like his dad ) and his small daughter . Another man , wearing overalls , an American flag shirt and a smile like happiness itself lays his moccasins down flat and fast , but as gently as you would lay a blanket across a baby 's cheek . " Maybe that 's the real flatdance , " says a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving it all he 's got , pumping elbows and jumping high and sideways like his feet hurt . His partner , a beautiful woman in loose short shorts , looks like she 's having the time of her life . He 's flapping his low-knotted tie at her because it 's hot out there , despite all the spinning ceiling fans . <p> Next to the dance floor is a row of gray-haired ladies , smiling at their friends and nodding to the beat . One of them , who looks like she started out tiny and then shrunk a bit , might have been 90 a few years ago . She is gathered up tenderly by a big man in a cowboy hat , who supports her forearms as they dance , except for the times when she reaches down to swish her skirts a bit . <p> New bands keep coming on , and they keep hitting the flatfoot tunes to please the crowd . When a waltz is finally played , a tourist couple from Pennsylvania takes the opportunity to step smartly around the floor . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then again for the country-ham raffle , then again for the 50-50 . At the third passing of the bucket I remember something Freeman had said earlier about a trust fund , but I 'm not sure what that was all about . <p> At around 10 , people begin to wander out , and I wonder if the Jamboree could be breaking up so early . Not exactly . " Go on outside , " somebody says . " There 's four or five bands playing out there . " <p> I find one between the general store and the hardware store , picking and singing and leaning into each other in the dark , with a small crowd around them . The woman in the two-piece red dress , of double-knee-action fame , is there . She is dancing by herself now , having worn out the last of her partners . <p> Finally I make my way back to the Farmer 's Foods lot on Route 221 where I have parked , and then down the road to the Pine Tavern Lodge , where Mrs. Ingham has given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains , and thick towels , all for the single room rate because it was all she had left . <p> Early the next morning , glad I had gone to bed early , I awakened to birdsong . Out on the porch I watched the mist roll over the thousands of pines edging the hills , turning them a luminous blue-green . <p> Then I wheeled my bike out to 221 and started to the left , as Mrs. Ingham had instructed me . Down the road a mile or so I took a right onto 860 , which leads to the Blue Ridge Parkway . At 7:30 on this Saturday morning it was as good as my own private road . The sun was rising and burning off the mist , the cows were grazing and drinking at a startlingly noisy brook , and I was swooping and curving through the mountain greenery , cold and alive . <p> I did n't actually make it the six miles to the parkway ( those are some serious hills ) . Instead I turned right on Franklin Road , which took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my right , but I headed in the other direction , past the Blue Ridge Restaurant 's famous country breakfasts to Farmer 's for some fruit . That healthy feeling was too hard won to lose just yet . <p> Later I went by Cockram 's again , to see what was on the shelves and to chat with whomever was there , it being that kind of place . That was when I noticed the " for sale " sign . Inside , I asked Freeman about it . <p> That , it turned out , was what the trust fund was all about . A few years back , a local business defaulted on a loan Cockram had extended . The consequences of this were such that Cockram was forced to sell part of the store to a partner , and now that partner was in financial trouble also . Trouble , it seems , is never far these days from a small farming community . <p> Cockram does n't want to lose his store , but the idea of ending the 15-year tradition of the jamboree is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been in to visit , said Cockram  --  even the governor . There has been talk of some kind of historical preservation grant , although so far nothing has happened . True , the store is old  --  but it seemed to me that something more like a cultural preservation grant was called for . <p> At the jamboree , I heard music made for the pure love of it and was a part of its joyful , spontaneous appreciation . The experience had no more of a commercial flavor than the tomatoes on my deck , and I counted it rare and precious for that reason . <p> Evelyn Callicutt , a keyboard musician from North Carolina , dropped by to chat with Freeman before heading home . She has been coming to the jamboree for many years , ever since her brother died . <p> " I think if I had n't had this place to come to I would have had to pay a doctor for help , " she said . " I could stand the loss of my mother , and my Daddy . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . "
