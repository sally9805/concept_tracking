There 's something different about the issue you 're holding in your hands . After President Clinton 's historic testimony and defiant confession speech on Monday , we decided to speed up our schedule so that the magazine would be out this Thursday rather than next Monday . <P> The main reason was simple : we wanted you to get our reporting on how and why Clinton made his amazing pirouette while it was still fresh and timely , instead of waiting until next week . In putting out a weekly magazine , our goal is both to be newsy and to put events into thoughtful perspective . Sometimes we feel that these interests can best be served by adjusting our schedule , and Monday 's important events clearly made this one of those times . <P> Such a change is unusual for us , but not unprecedented . In the past we have made similar arrangements because of presidential debates and superpower summits , and for national elections we have closed an issue on Wednesday nights rather than wait for the weekend . Clinton 's testimony and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anguishing investigation , provided another defining moment that warranted being flexible about our schedule . <P> Our aim was not to be part of some rush to judgment . People are going to have to make their own judgments about what this means for Clinton and our country by sorting through what they know , think and feel . We 'll be covering the ongoing fallout over the next few weeks and months . Instead of prejudging or predicting what that verdict will be , we wanted to put forth all the facts as we now know them , provide inside reporting about how the Clintons and others came to make their momentous decisions , and offer some well-reasoned analysis by our own reporters and respected thinkers that would shed light on the issues involved . That way , we felt , we might offer a smart harbor amid the gales of punditry now in full force . <P> Our Washington bureau , led by Michael Duffy , spent Tuesday and Wednesday getting briefed on what Clinton said , why he said it and the internal debates leading up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around the country , we became even more excited about getting this issue to you this week rather than next . The whole process was , indeed , energizing , and we hope you 'll find that passion reflected in these pages . <P> Walter Isaacson , Managing Editor
