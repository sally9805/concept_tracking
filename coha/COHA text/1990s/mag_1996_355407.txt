Agreed : those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it . The real problem is that sometimes so are those who remember it . And there you have the predicament of recent Republican history . From the time in the 1970s when the right wing of the G.O.P. zapped the moderates once and for all  --  a pivotal moment in that struggle was the substitution of Bob Dole for Nelson Rockefeller as Gerald Ford 's running mate  --  there has never been any doubt as to whether the G.O.P. would be a conservative body . The only real questions have been how conservative and whose notion of conservatism it would be . If Republicans ever find an answer that truly matches the national mood , they might yet become the majority party they feel sure they must be . Two elections in recent years , Ronald Reagan 's in 1980 and the congressional sweep two years ago , have brought them close . Then the same conservatives who revitalized the party ended by dragging it away to a place all their own . <P> So Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the center , trimming on abortion and tacking on gun control . And whenever he does , explosive factions blow up in his face . Today Republicans are divided between socially moderate suburbanites and Ralph Reed 's cultural conservatives , between supply-side tax cutters and old-fashioned budget balancers , between Pat Buchanan 's protectionists and everybody else 's free traders . In some ways the G.O.P. is like some massive geological formation . Each postwar upheaval  --  the cold war , the civil rights movement , the expansion of the Federal Government , the sexual revolution  --  left behind some powerful formation and a fracture line . <P> The party that Dole will stand before this week started to take shape more than three decades ago , at about the time he arrived in national politics . Dole was first elected to the House in 1960 , the year Jack Kennedy regained the White House for Democrats , who already controlled Congress . The conventional wisdom foresaw a new era of liberalism and activist government . For once the conventional wisdom was right . But most of the 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Young Fogeys . That was fine with Dole . During his eight years in the House , he would be cited repeatedly by the Americans for Constitutional Action as the most conservative member of Congress . <P> Dole 's brand of conservatism , however , which favored Small Government yet was susceptible to the charms of Washington when it came to things like farm-price supports , was being outpaced not only by the triumphant liberals but also by another kind of conservatism . A new right wing was consolidating within the party , causing internal splits that Nixon 's loss to Kennedy made worse . On one side was an old-line Republican establishment built mostly on the East Coast and in the Midwest . Its guiding doctrine was containment , not just in international affairs but at home as well . Republican moderates resigned to Moscow and Beijing had likewise accepted peaceful coexistence with the legacies of the New Deal , things like Social Security , government-backed mortgages and G.I. loans .                  @ @ @
