We were both sitting in old-fashioned green metal lawn chairs that rocked back gently on metal tube frames if you wanted them to , and I did . I rocked as I sipped the strong , lemony tea up through the straw , hoping Mrs. Eelpout would tell me a story . She was sniffling , still getting used to the news : Her friend and neighbor 's cremated ashes had been found in a garbage can . <p> Mrs. Eelpout was wearing tortoise-shell glasses that swooped up at the corners , making her look like a lynx . The lenses seemed to be very , very thick bifocals with wavy half-moons across the bottoms for reading . Her hand trembled as she placed her own glass on the wrought-iron table between us . I was afraid she might spill her tea on the tape recorder . It had taken me a while to convince Mrs. Eelpout to let me use it . Only when I 'd insisted that nothing was left of poor Mrs. DiLuna , except for a few memories that might be lodged inside Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch it on . <p> " How could someone  --  her own son , no less  --  do a thing like that ? " Mrs. Eelpout smoothed the apron that she 'd put on , for ceremonial purposes , when she went inside the trailer to pour the tea . The apron was clean and pressed , but so worn that the pattern of tiny pink flowers had almost washed away . She 'd been shocked at first , then angry , and then weepy when I told her how the new people renting my trailer had found a brass-cornered wooden box in the garbage can out back , containing the cremated remains of her friend . <p> " Did she ever talk about her last wishes ? " I asked . The expression , which I had never used before , felt puckery in my mouth like a bite of grapefruit . <p> " Sure she did , " Mrs. Eelpout said . " She talked about her last wishes , and I talked about mine . She wanted to be buried back East beside her second husband , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Abode of Bliss Cemetery , right between my mama and Mr. Eelpout . Why , she had her plot waiting for her , the headstone carved and everything , she told me . Now why could n't they do that for the poor old thing ? " <p> " Money , probably , " I said . " They skipped town after the cremation leaving lots of debts . They never paid the funeral home . They did n't even call an ambulance  --  they were driving her to the hospital in the next county after she 'd had a stroke when she died of congestive heart failure in the back seat  --  at least that 's what the coroner 's report says . " I leaned forward , checking to make sure the volume on the machine was turned high enough . " And when they got the cremated ashes from the funeral home , they just dumped the box in the garbage can and cleared out , knowing they could n't pay the bills . " <p> " We were summer friends ; ' Mrs. Eelpout said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside that trailer . Her son 's wife , that Sherrie , would help her outside , and she 'd settle down right in that very chair you 're sitting in . Sherrie 'd put an afghan over Mrs. DiLuna 's lap , and I 'd make some tea , just like now . We 'd sit here talking for hours whenever it was fine , listening to the birds , watching things poking up in my little garden . Those were the flowers she loved best . " Mrs. Eelpout pointed at some yellow flowers that looked like trumpets , growing up along the edge of the trailer . <p> " What are they ? " I asked . <p> " Squash flowers  --  zucchini . But I never get any zucchini . You need the right bee to come along , they say . I would n't have bothered with them this year , but ! knew Mrs. DiLuna doted on them , and I thought I 'd be seeing her again once the weather turned fine . I thought she 'd be looking forward to coming outside after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " So you did n't visit her in the winter ? " <p> " Once I put on my boots and tramped over  --  it was before Christmas , and I had a little poinsettia for her  --  but that woman , that Sherrie , told me she was n't feeling well . She just took the plant and did n't even invite me in for a moment . I tried calling once , on her birthday in February , but they told me she was too weak to talk on the phone . I knew she was frail . Sometimes when they brought her outside near the end of last summer she was all out of breath . It 'd be an hour before she 'd be able to say anything . " <p> " Do you think she belonged in a nursing home ? " <p> Mrs. Eelpout sniffed loudly . " I do n't wish a nursing home on any poor soul . At least they brought her outside in the fine weather . But not this year . I called to that woman once when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mama ? ' I called , and she waved , and said , ' She 's pretty poorly , the air might be too much for her this summer . ' I felt bad . I 'd already put in my squash flowers . Then two weeks ago I saw all that trash out front , and the venetian blinds off the windows . I thought they 'd just moved in the night , and taken poor Mrs. DiLuna along with them . " She lifted the corner of her apron , and dabbed at her eyes . " I had a good cry . Moved away , and we never got to say goodbye . And now this : ' <p> The evening sky was a thick egg-white color . The yellow squash flowers were beginning to shrink and close like balloons leaking air . I could almost see them trembling before my eyes . A dove called from the single pine tree that had not been cut down when the trailer court was opened . Back when Denny and I had lived here , before we moved to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had called it our lonesome pine because we had a view of it from our tiny bedroom window when we made love . <p> " She was a sweet thing , Minnie was ; ' Mrs. Eelpout said , clearing her throat and looking down at the tape recorder . " We called each other by our first names when we were alone together , you see . She always called me Willa . Willa , she 'd say , you do grow the most beautiful zinnias and bachelor buttons . When they first moved in here , it was two summers ago , I could n't get over the three of them when they got out of the car , that son of hers , Nick , with the ugly wolf tattooed on one shoulder , and that Sherrie , his wife , with her big puffed-up hair , like a high school girl 's with a bow on the top , and she almost fifty , and then poor sweet Minnie , her snow-white hair curled like a little lamb 's back , trotting behind them with her walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She always had trouble with those steps to the trailer over there  --  they 're not a natural size , I do n't think . " <p> I looked over at the trailer . I remembered those steps . I 'd even fallen down them once when I 'd had too much to drink . Luckily there 'd been a deep snowfall , so I 'd only landed on my face in a drift . Now I realized we should have called in a carpenter . I hated being a landlady , The only time I 'd ever seen Mrs. DiLuna was the time i 'd gone over to unstop the sink . Sherrie had leaned against the counter , eating Pringles one by one out of a red can as I worked the plunger , pulling up goop . Afterwards , I 'd noticed a mound of blankets on the sofa . It seemed to be moving . <p> " Nick 's mom , " Sherrie had said , gesturing with a chip . And I 'd seen a tiny little face peeping out at me . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I smiled . A tiny , crooked hand was clutching the satin edge of one of the blankets . <p> Denny said he 'd seen her a couple of times , when he was over doing repairs . He 'd seen her bundled up in a lawn chair one afternoon . We did n't even know her name until the ashes turned up and the sheriff got on the case . I felt especially bad because I wrote about interesting people for the " Life Style " page of our local paper . She had n't seemed interesting , so I 'd ignored her . <p> But the idea that somebody could end up as ashes in some old battered garbage can really bothered me . My God , she had a life , I told Denny , ninety years of life , and now there 's nothing ? Is that possible ? <p> He looked at me , nodding wisely , and when I made that little high-pitched shriek he hates so much that I ca n't help making when something really gets to me , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , if that 'll make you feel any better ? " <p> " All right , I will , " I said . And here I was . <p> Mrs. Eelpout spread her hands out over her knees and took a deep breath . Her nails were bitten down to the bright pink quick , and it startled me that someone would still be biting her nails in her eighties . I was a nail biter myself , and I kept thinking I 'd outgrow the habit . Now I suddenly realized that I never would . <p> " My memory 's not what it was , " Mrs. Eelpout said . " We talked about a lot of things , and sometimes we did n't talk at all . But those squash flowers "  --  she lifted one big hand and waved it over in the direction of the shriveled yellow trumpets  --  " they ' 11 always remind me of her ? <p> Minnie  --  her real name in Italian was Dominica , Mrs. Eelpout said  --  had been taken out of the village school in Sicily when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and housekeeper for the whole family , her father and mother , her seven brothers and sisters , and her grandparents . When they all emigrated to America , she 'd been excited , thinking they were going to a place where she 'd get to live a real life , like the kind she saw flickering by in the wonderful movies that were shown in the town hall on Sundays after the Angelus . She wanted her lips to be shaped like a bow , and her thick , waist-length hair cut so that it swung against her chin . But nothing changed for her in the new country . Her family lived far out in the sticks , beyond the Baltimore streetcar line ; her father beat her and cuffed her just like he had in Sicily , only now there was n't a village well she could dart down to every day and use as an excuse for exchanging complaints and gossip with other girls and women ; and the long cold winter , with its constant rain squalls off the Atlantic and the occasional heavy snowfall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the farm  --  in the spring she had to do the hoeing and plant the vegetables and do all the weeding , but she welcomed the work , because it took her away from her father 's malevolent reach for most of the day . Suppers were a nightmare . She had n't cooked the spaghetti al dente , the way he liked it , he said , or else he complained about too much salt in the soup . She usually got a box on the ear , or a slap across the mouth . Later , when she was grown and married , she hated cooking , and all her meals came from Betty Crocker or Kraft . <p> Once , back in Sicily , she 'd planted some lavender and wild carnations in a little plot just for herself . One day her father , tramping about to see if she was keeping after the weeds , had discovered her flowers . His face turned almost maroon . How dare she waste her time on what was n't edible ? He brought shovelfuls of ash from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all disappeared into a sooty mound while she stood there watching helplessly , and then he took off his belt and whacked her over the shoulders until she fell face-down in the carrots . <p> After that , she used to plant row after row of zucchini , because of the yellow flowers . She 'd go out into the garden after supper , pretending she was plucking lettuce , and she 'd admire their beauty , and when she came back to the house , she kept her eyes lowered so that her father could not see that anything had given her pleasure . <p> In Maryland , the rich soil felt light and full of air . It did not have the cloying , putrid odor of the Sicilian dirt , turned over every year until it seemed sour , full of rotted tomatoes and moldy , hairy tubers . She dropped her zucchini seeds , a new American variety , into the raked rows , afraid they would n't come up for her , but to her joy they sprouted and grew into plants larger than she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as orchids , and she had never seen such firm , perfectly striped zucchini . <p> She was sixteen . She was assigned to serve dinner to the large table of shouting , drunken men who had gathered to help pick the tomatoes that August . The trestle table was set out under the Concord grape arbor , and she had to go back and forth to the house with platters of spaghetti and big tureens of puttanesca sauce . There were jugs of red wine on the table . Some of the older men had faces like twisted pumpkins ; the younger men had shiny hair the color of eggplants , and they pinched her bottom when she passed by them if her father was n't looking . But he was drunk , roaring out jokes and singing snatches from operas . Years afterwards , she 'd switch off the radio if she caught even one line of an aria , hating opera as much as she hated the Italian language after she 'd learned to speak English . <p> She 'd just returned with another basket of bread when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she 'd been prey for a crab . <p> " Here 's your wife , Mario , " he shouted , pushing her into the arms of a middle-aged man with a thick neck . He was their richest neighbor . His wife had died the year before . She 'd seen him looking at her in church . <p> Now he kissed her so hard that her lips were bruised the next day , shouting as she struggled to get away , " My little anchovy , my little radicchio , I could eat you up ? <p> " When 's the wedding ? " somebody shouted . <p> " Next month she 'll be cooking Mario 's dinner , " her father cackled . " And I 'll be admiring my new apple trees . " <p> She knew then that she was being traded for the orchard he coveted , which bordered their own property . <p> That night she could n't sleep . She lay very still on her back , her head like a wooden block on the pillow , listening to her sister breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father as soon as the house was quiet . <p> The rifles were kept upright in a rack at the foot of the stairs . She was used to seeing things killed . Her father was always bringing down crows , or lugging bloody rabbits back from the fields . She had seen him put the muzzle of his rifle against the head of an old lame horse that could n't work anymore , and she had not turned her eyes away at the spewing blood and matter when the bullet exploded . She had helped her brothers push the horse into the pit they had dug down near the creek . Her father had taught her to chop the heads off chickens back in Sicily , guiding her small , horrified hands with his huge , leathery paws . <p> She knew he had passed out in his favorite chair in the front room . She could hear his rolling snores . Her older brothers were drunk , too , sprawled face-down on the cots in their own room , and her mother was in the bedroom across the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited . She felt disembodied , neutral . She had no emotions . There was merely an action to perform , and then she would be free . She knew they would put her in jail , maybe hang her after a trial , but it was better not to try to imagine anything beyond the act she had to perform . <p> Her sister was breathing gently , her face buried in her hair . She got out of bed so as not to disturb her and quickly dressed in the dark . She looped her high-topped shoes around her neck by their laces and stuffed a pair of cotton stockings into her pocket . Was she going to run away afterwards ? Her life seemed like a fantasy to her . She did not know who was in charge , her will or her body . <p> At the bottom of the stairs , she put her hand on the stock of a rifle . But as she touched the smooth wood , a vibration went through her , as if the gun had just fired , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She could n't kill him . She must have only dreamed that she was going to kill him . She felt clammy and frightened . <p> A snort , sounding like it came from a mule loose in the house , made her jump back . It was her father . She held her breath until the regular snores resumed . <p> But the sound brought her back to herself . She could n't kill him , but she had to do something . She had to get away from this place tonight . <p> The only place she could think of to go , the only place that in any way belonged to her , besides the bedroom that she shared with her sister , was her garden . <p> The moonlight shining through the thin clouds seemed espedally bright when she stepped outside the kitchen door , careful to make no noise . She could hear the chickens ducking and rustling in the pen . The dog had been tied up in the barn , and his sporadic barks meant nothing . She might be a passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shed , then slipped into the garden . <p> Dew was already coming up from the ground , thick as tears in the grass . Her bare feet were wet . She felt a snail under her toe and drew her foot back before she crushed it . She went down the rows of her zucchini plants and picked every one , no matter the size . She found one last yellow flower still blooming . She hesitated , then put it behind her ear . She heaved the sack over her shoulders . <p> At the crossroads , she waited for the first wagon to pass on its way to Baltimore with fresh produce . She waved to the man , who pulled up his chuffing team and leaned down , sweeping off his battered felt hat as if to hear her better . She asked him if he wanted to buy some zucchini . <p> He looked at her curiously , pulling at his mustache . He named a price that was so low that she waved him on , and he shrugged , swirling his whip over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The men were cheeky , and she held herself rigidly , not looking after them as they laughed and pulled away . <p> An hour later , a young man with distinct , fresh eyebrows , as mobile as caterpillars , agreed to her price . He also agreed to give her a ride into Baltimore and helped her climg up onto the seat beside him . He tossed the sack of zucchini into the back of the wagon , on top of his bushel baskets of tomatoes , and as they clopped slowly toward the city , glowing with new electric lights in the distance , he told her about his sisters , Concetta and Angelica , and how they both worked in the candy factory , where he was sure they could find her a job , too , stirring the vats of chocolate or nougat , or hand-dipping the cherries or nuts , or even placing the cooled candies into the little crinkled papers inside fresh white boxes . <p> And at night , they would let her bring home the little damaged chocolates to eat herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm with Concetta and Angelica . <p> On warm nights , she could sit out on the white marble steps and listen to someone down the street play the accordion . Perhaps she would even let him sit beside her , he said softly , and she looked up . Was n't that star the morning star ? <p> She sat there , looking into the misty distance as she listened to the clop , clop of the horses ' hooves carrying her away from a nightmare in which she had almost murdered her father , and into a dream of the future  --  movies and chocolates and rowhouses with marble steps all mixed together in her sleepy head . A whole long wonderful life stretched ahead of her . <p> Many years later , married to the man who had helped her escape from home , she 'd still sometimes wake with a start in her mortgaged rowhouse beside Memorial Stadium , thinking that she 'd just blown her father 's head off with a rifle . She 'd sit up in bed , clammy in her nightgown , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember how she 'd reluctantly gone back to the farm to visit her father on his deathbed . He 'd been in a coma , his withered face slack and his breathing raspy . He had not recognized her , but she had knelt at the foot of his four-poster bed along with her frail mother and her spinster sister and her pregnant sisters-in-law , saying the rosary , and she 'd wept at his funeral like all the other women . Then , to push away the last cobwebs of the nightmare before she dared to curl back into sleep , she 'd remind herself of the moment when she 'd lifted her son  --  the spitting image of his grandfather , according to all the relatives  --  up to view the coffined face . The boy had struggled in her arms for a moment , not wanting to look , and then at last he 'd peeped , frowned , and stuck out his tongue . <p> <p> By MAURA STANTON <p>                 @ @ @ @
