##n't want Josie thinking he just wanted to get her into bed . Even if he did . Badly . " Unless you want to go out . " <p> Josie hummed shyly . " I 'm okay with either . Let 's decide after you get here . How 'd everything go ? Are Mac and Lilith with you ? " <p> Rick glanced back at the service door he 'd used to exit the office building , expecting his former boss and his lover to appear at any moment . He had n't wanted to tell Josie about tonight 's operation . Hell , he had n't wanted to take part in the interrogation in the first place . He was n't a stickler for every single rule in the law enforcement handbook , but he did have limits . And tonight , nearly every single one had been pushed to the breaking point . <p> If Mac Mancusi had n't been the one asking for his help , Rick would have refused . Mac had been chief of detectives in the Chicago P.D . since Rick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job a few days ago for pissing off the mayor , he was still Rick 's friend . Rick trusted him implicitly  --  even after he 'd come to him with a story that might have made a great feature film . A mutually hated defense attorney had supposed ties to a massive drug shipment their sources reported was about to hit the streets . Believable enough . But then Mac had added in the possibility that the well-connected lawyer was also , possibly , a warlock . <p> Cue the creepy soundtrack . <p> And yet , Rick had still listened . Lilith St. Lyon had backed up Mac 's outlandish suspicions and though she was a little woo-woo herself , she 'd never steered Rick wrong , even if she did scare the crap out of him . He 'd grown up in Little Havana and while he had a healthy respect for the brujas and santeros , he certainly did n't subscribe to their ways . The one and only time he 'd met his maternal great-grandmother , a woman whose Sight had reportedly once caught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to never want to visit his parents ' homeland again . When Lilith , a psychic , had asked Rick to be a conduit through which she could listen in on his interrogation of Boothe Thompson , the defense attorney suspected in the murder of a low-level drug dealer , Rick had reluctantly agreed . The ends justified the means . And he was n't six years old and in a foreign country anymore . <p> But they 'd learned nothing new . Before Rick had left the building and called Josie , Mac and Lilith had been right behind him . <p> " Maybe they came out in the front , " he said , more to himself than to Josie . <p> He started walking as he told her more than he should about their operation . He 'd already fractured just about every department regulation tonight by conspiring with a suspended officer to interrogate a respected defense attorney . Telling Josie the outcome was n't going to get him any more fired . <p> " We got nothing , " he admitted . " The man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fess up to anything , and I was right . " <p> " And Lilith could n't sense anything ? " she asked . <p> While Rick asked the questions , Mac and Lilith had been in a nearby room , listening in through a psychic connection Rick did n't even try to understand . But Lilith had n't discovered anything they could use to connect Thompson to the murder of the dealer or the impending drug shipment . <p> " Nothing we could use , " he admitted , gulping down his frustration . <p> For as long as he could remember , Rick had wanted to be a cop . He 'd finished high school a year early , studied criminal justice in college and joined the Miami-Dade department before he was twenty-one . Known for his efficient , cool and reasoned thinking , he 'd moved up quickly to detective . After five years of an endless battle against the influx of drugs in Miami , he 'd moved to Chicago , hoping to broaden his knowledge base . Deal with crimes that were n't always about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was back where he did n't want to be  --  in the middle of yet another drug war , one that was being influenced by someone very powerful and , as of yet , very unknown . <p> " And what did it feel like , having Lilith use you that way ? " Josie asked . " Was it cool ? " <p> The fascination in her voice made him chuckle and forget how the whole setup had initially unnerved him . As a cop , he was used to dealing with hunches , and he 'd always guessed that Lilith just had better hunches than most . In Little Havana , however , he 'd met a few brujas , like his great-grandmother in Cuba , whose insight had been downright scary . A witch in Miami had predicted his father 's heart attack only days before he 'd been felled by a cardiac episode that should have killed him . But because of the witch , he 'd put an aspirin in his pocket  --  and that little pill had saved his life . <p> " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was there , listening in . At one point , she even suggested that I ask a certain question and I just  --  " <p> Rick , help us . <p> What the hell ? <p> He pulled the phone away from his ear . A few people strode beside him on the sidewalk with heads down and strides swift . At the curb , a driver leaned lazily against a stretch limousine , tapping into his iPhone . Rick peered into the office building 's lobby . No sign of Mac or Lilith , even though he could have sworn he just heard her voice . <p> " Rick ? Rick , are you there ? " <p> Tinny and distant , Josie 's voice echoed from the phone , which he lifted back to his ear . <p> " Yeah , " he confirmed . " I just  --  " <p> Rick , please . Hear me . He 's not a warlock . The mayor is . Thompson 's a witch . Black magic . He 'll kill us . <p> " Just what ? Rick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , but the crowded feeling in his mind did n't lessen . Lilith was invading his consciousness , but this time , she was calling for help . <p> He stopped walking and turned . He spied the plates on the limousine . City government issue . The mayor ? <p> At that moment , the driver spared him a glance . Rick gave a nod , then turned and cursed . " It 's Lilith . She 's connected to me again . They 're in trouble . He 's going to kill them . He 's a witch , and he 's using black magic . " <p> Josie gasped . " Can you  --  " <p> " Yes , " Rick said , " I 've got to go . " <p> " Be  --  " <p> He snapped the phone shut . He did n't need Josie 's warning . For the benefit of the limo driver , he strode casually back down the sidewalk , but broke into a run and yanked out his firearm once he cleared the side of the building . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in deep . Witches ? Warlocks ? Black magic ? This was all too fucking weird , but he had to try and help . He could n't leave them to die . <p> He 'd used a service door to exit the building , but it had locked automatically behind him . If he tried the front entrance and alerted security or the mayor 's driver , all hell could break loose . Demanding instant cooperation from his frazzled brain , Rick spotted a ratty cushion protruding from a nearby Dumpster . He grabbed it , placed it over the unyielding knob and fired his weapon into the lock , muffling the sound as best he could . For a split second , he considered calling for backup , but this had been an unauthorized operation from the start . Rick had helped Mac out of loyalty , out of trust . The backlash against both of them could ruin their careers forever . He 'd trust Mac a little while longer . His suspension notwithstanding , Mac was a good cop . And a good friend . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought hard , trying to communicate to Lilith that he was on his way . He felt her screaming just before the elevator reached the floor he somehow knew she was on . As the doors slid open , he saw her standing across from the recently elected mayor of Chicago , whose hands sparked with electricity that swirled before his eyes and formed into a stunning lethal ball . <p> Rick could n't speak . He could n't move . No one had noticed the elevator , but when the doors started to close , he instinctively stepped out and stood , motionless , unable to fully comprehend what he was seeing . The defense attorney , Boothe Thompson lay motionless and empty-eyed at the mayor 's feet . When Mac drew his gun , the mayor shifted and waved his sparking hand . The gun flew across the hallway . Mac dove to retrieve the weapon and before Rick could act , Lilith plunged forward , the glint of her knife flashing only a split second before it disappeared inside the mayor 's chest . <p> Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , and Lilith ? Rick shouted at Mac , who turned and saw Lilith on the floor . He screamed her name and flew to her side . <p> Rick stepped forward , but was stopped by a dark shadow that poured out of the mayor 's eye sockets and mouth , then surrounded Rick like a wool blanket in July . Itchy . Hot . Smothering . <p> Take me in , human . <p> The voice pounded hard against Rick 's skull , as if demanding entrance . The excruciating pain stole Rick 's eyesight and squeezed his trachea shut . The chain he wore around his neck tightened and the crucifix at the end burned . He dropped to his knees . His gun thumped to the ground beside him . <p> I am not through with this world , the voice continued , cutting into Rick 's ears , stabbing at his brain . So young . So powerful , it expressed lustily . Your rewards will be endless . <p> A million jumbled thoughts exploded in Rick 's mind . Images of decadence , luxury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand temptation to someone who had not been forewarned . <p> But Rick had heard his great-grandmother , even if her prophecy when he was six had gifted him with a lifetime of nightmares . <p> You will fight a great evil who will offer you everything you 've ever wanted , she 'd said in Spanish . But only you can resist him , nio . Only you can destroy him . <p> Rick concentrated on the memory , holding on to it like a lifeline , fixing the image of his bisabuela 's rheumy blue eyes , kind toothless grin and the saint 's medal she 'd clutched in her hand as she spoke . Fire exploded in his chest and a scream of anguish unlike any he 'd ever heard burst through his eardrums . The pounding in his head intensified , nearly knocking him unconscious as the shadow tightened around him then , in a flash , dispersed . Behind him , the dark entity slid into the cracks of the elevator door and disappeared . <p> Rick gulped in the cool air as his eyes adjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been only darkness . As he struggled , he had the irresistible urge to throw himself into the nearest steaming hot shower to wash away the filth that seemed crusted , invisible , to his skin . <p> Grabbing blindly , he found his firearm and attempted to stand . He lifted his weapon , but just as Mac 's had , the gun shot out of his grip , landing in the hands of a regal , dark-haired woman dressed entirely in purple . She had materialized directly in his path . <br> Continues ...                     @@649985 Rick punched Josie Vargas 's number into his cell phone . He 'd only dialed the seven digits twice since he 'd met her , but the sequence flowed from his memory , with a bit of a melody behind it , as if he 'd memorized it with the music like the alphabet song . Their first real date , just last night , had been incredibly ordinary and ultimately fantastic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of talking . <p> And then , the kissing . <p> Lots and lots of kissing . <p> He 'd had to harness every ounce of his self-control not to try and seduce her out of her clothes the moment they 'd stepped into her apartment . Not an easy task for either of them , but they 'd managed to remain upright and fully dressed . <p> Damn it . <p> They were n't teenagers . And clearly , both of them knew a good thing when they saw it . So they 'd disentangled from each other with a promise to take things slowly . <p> Get to know each other . <p> Become friends first . <p> Good thing they lived in Chicago , where cold showers were cheap and easy to come by . <p> Rick hit the Talk button on his phone , then adjusted the crotch of his slacks as he walked away from the office building where he 'd just engaged in an unauthorized and unwise operation with his former boss . He 'd much rather think about Josie . Her silky hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thinking about her got him hard as a rock , which made it so much easier to forget just how many rules he 'd broken in the past twenty-four hours and how , in all likelihood , his career was about to nose-dive into a backed-up toilet . <p> Might not be so bad with Josie around . She certainly made all the other parts of his life a lot more interesting . <p> Rick had n't been the same since the moment she 'd literally run into him at the precinct . She 'd been searching for her best friend , Lilith St. Lyon , the department 's on-call psychic . Since Rick had been trained from birth by his Cuban-American mother and his equally old-school sisters to socialize only with women who would someday make a good wife , he might not have noticed her otherwise . Her blond , sun-streaked hair , hippy-dippy tunic , long skirt and lace-up sandals put her in the " do not touch " category . And yet , he 'd been intrigued . <p> She broke every rule his familia had laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her last name was Vargas , so she had a Latin connection , but every member of her family came with a rap sheet . <p> Catholic ? <p> Ha ! Wiccan . <p> Loves children ? <p> He had n't yet garnered her opinion on nios or nias , but she 'd hinted that her crazy childhood had n't left her unscarred . <p> Adores cooking and cleaning and tending to her man 's every need ? <p> Again , Rick chuckled . He could certainly imagine Josie preferring to live her life barefoot , but pregnant and in the kitchen ? Never in a million years . <p> Of course , his family was n't stuck entirely in the previous century . They also wanted from college so that she could , if necessary , support the family should Rick 's career in law enforcement come to a violent end . But as far as he knew , Josie had graduated exclusively from the school of hard knocks .

There would be no moving to Miami once the kidlets arrived , as was expected . <p> The perfect woman she was not . <p> And yet , Rick could n't get her out of his mind . <p> " In the mood for pizza ? " he asked after she finally answered the phone with a breathless hello that made his skin dance with a shamefully electric thrill . <p> " Deep-dish ? " <p> The relief in her voice was unmistakable and incredibly appealing . She knew he 'd been on the job tonight . She 'd been worried , too . And as much as he did n't want to cause her any anxiety , he liked the idea that she cared . <p> Liked it a lot . <p> " Is there any other kind of pizza in this town ? " <p> " Want to go out or order in ? " <p> " In , " Rick said instantly , then caught the eagerness in his voice . After the make-out session they 'd shared last night , he did
