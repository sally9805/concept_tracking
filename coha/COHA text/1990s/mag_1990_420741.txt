Section : Lifestyle <p> Better treatments , but prevention is still a dream <p> For all the pain and death , all the tears and rage , the news about cancer is not entirely grim . Fifty years ago breast tumors were rarely discovered before attaining the size of golf balls . By the time they were detected , their deadly offspring had infiltrated the lymph nodes and were making their way to the lungs , bones , liver and brain . Doctors fought back with the only weapon they had  --  the now infamous radical mastectomy  --  but to little avail . <p> Today , thanks to better screening techniques , tumors are now commonly detected and removed two to three years before they can even be felt . Surgery for more advanced tumors has become far less barbar-ic . And advances in cell analysis promise to make today 's drug treatments far more effective in the future . The problem is that scientific knowledge accrues slowly , and people are still dying fast . Breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and prevention is still just a dream . <p> Figures showing nearly a 30 percent rise in incidence since the 1970s can create the impression of a runaway epidemic . But many experts are encouraged by the increase , for much of it reflects earlier detection-and early detection improves the odds of successful treatment . " This is an example of bad news being good news , " says Dr. Vincent DeVita Jr. , former head of the National Cancer Institute and now a researcher at New York 's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center . " Combine the gains from mammography screening with advances in treatment , and you can predict a substantial decline in breast-can-cer mortality in the 1990s . " <p> No one knows just how much of the bad news is good news . In a recent study designed specifically to gauge the impact of early detection , researchers at Seattle 's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center plotted the actual increase in western Washington 's breast-cancer rate against the increase that rising mammography rates would have produced by themselves . The region 's overall breast-cancer rate rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that earlier detection accounted completely for the rise among 45-to 64-year-old women . Women in that age group ( who suffer 40 ' percent of all breast cancers ) actually experienced a smaller increase than early detection could have accounted for , and the increase consisted entirely of small tumors that had n't invaded the lymph nodes . Yet early detection explained only half of the increase among women who were under 44 or over 65 . <p> Risk factors : Those actual increases pose knotty problems for medical science . For unlike lung cancer  --  a far bigger killer fueled largely by cigarette smoke  --  breast cancer has few known avoidable causes . Epidemiologists have identified several risk factors , but fewer than half of all cases can be linked to them . The average American woman has a 10 percent chance of developing the disease over a theoretical 110-year lifetime . But as Dr. Susan Love of Harvard Medical School explains in " Dr. Susan Love 's Breast Book , " * the lifetime risk would be considerably lower ( about 3.3 percent ) for a woman who lacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or more . <p> Family history is one of the best barometers of risk . " Of all common cancers in human beings , " notes Dr. John Mulvihill , a geneticist at the University of Pittsburgh , " breast cancer is the one that seems to travel in families the most . " A woman whose mother develops breast cancer at an early age may be in six times as much danger as someone with no risk factors . But by most estimates , having an afflicted second-degree relative , such as an aunt or grandmother , confers just 1.5 times the base-line risk . Only 5 to 7 percent of all breast cancer is thought to be strictly hereditary . But scientists are now linking those cases to specific genes . Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital made headlines last week by identifying the gene for Li-Fraumeni syndrome , a hereditary condition associated with several different cancers . Breast cancer is one of its most common manifestations . <p> Family history is n't the only predictor of breast cancer . Other suspects include diet ( the evidence is mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , alcohol consumption ( even moderate drinking may push a woman 's relative risk to 1.5 times the base line ) and lifelong exposure to estrogen . Virtually anything that increases a woman 's estrogen exposure carly onset of menstruation , late menopause , the use of estrogen-replacement therapy during and after menopause  --  may raise the odds . Just last week , researchers at Boston 's Brigham and Women 's Hospital published research showing that the relative breast-cancer risk rises to 1.4 times the base line in women receiving estrogen-replacement therapy . Yet because the treatment can prevent heart disease and osteoporosis , swearing off estrogen could actually pose greater risks than taking it . <p> Until more can be done to prevent breast cancer , the important innovations will involve treatment . Because cancer cells do their deadliest work after escaping the breast , surgery holds little untapped potential . It 's still a necessary evil , but techniques have improved dramatically since the 1970s . Buoyed by clinical data showing that lumpectomy combined with radiation treatment is just as effective as breast removal , the National Cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still resort routinely to mastectomy , but it is now recommended only for tumors that are too advanced , too numerous or too deep within the breast to be excised any other way . <p> Reconstrucion : When mastectomy ca n't be avoided , much of the damage can now be repaired . Indeed , some surgeons now perform reconstructive surgery as part of the mastectomy operation . Using skin from the breast , back or abdomen , the surgeon fashions a new breast containing either silicone or , increasingly , the patient 's own tissue . Using a procedure known as the TRAM flap , Dr. Carl Hartrampf of St. Joseph 's Hospital in Atlanta opens the patient 's lower abdomen and tunnels excess fat tissue up into the new breast pocket without ever detaching it . New nipples are readily constructed from tattooed toe pads or breast tissue , or from small grafts of naturally pigmented vaginal tissue . <p> For many patients , surgery is only the beginning of the ordeal . If tests show that the malignancy has spread into the lymph system ( a phenomenon known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pursue the disease throughout the body . Until recently , women whose lymph nodes tested negative were spared the expense and toxicity of chemo , but 30 percent of them relapsed or died within 10 years . It is now clear that drug treatment can bring the relapse rate down to 20 percent in node-negative patients , but that knowledge has created new dilemmas . Should 70,000 women a year receive treatments that will help 5,000 of them at most ? Should a woman whose lymph nodes appear normal opt for a treatment that has less than one chance in 10 of helping her ? If so , which of the now myriad chemical agents should she receive ? <p> Multiple choices : Different physicians may prescribe entirely different courses of therapy for the same woman . Treatment is an inexact science at best , but it need n't be a complete shot in the dark . Doctors agree that cancer cells are more likely to have escaped from a four-centimeter tumor than from a one-centimeter tumor . The appearance of individual tumor cells can also help determine whether a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find receptors for estro-gert and progesterone on the surface of a woman 's tumor cells . Such cancers are generally responsive to tamoxifen , an estrogen-blocking drug that is leas toxic than chemotherapy . RU-486 , the French abortion pill , might also help control " re-ceptor-positive " cancers , since it blocks progesterone recep-tots . But anti-abortion pressure has made the drug difficult to obtain in this country , even for research . <p> Receptor status is n't the only indicator of a cancer cell 's potential deadliness . Scientists have recently devised an array of other prognostic tests . One technique , known as DNA flow cyme-merry , gauges a tumor 's growth rate by determining what percentage of its cells are synthesizing new DNA at a given moment . Another experimental test , known as HER-2/neu , screens tumor cells for a particular gene known to foster uncontrolled growth . Still another checks them for multidrug resistance protein , or MDR , a molecule that healthy cells use to expel toxic agents and that cancer cells can use to elude chemotherapy . No one yet knows how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let alone how to interpret their combined results . To generate the needed data , at least two laboratories  --  Dianon Systems of Stratford , Conn. , and the Nichols Institute in San Juan Capistrano , Calif.  --  now offer them as part of a comprehensive breast-tumor workup . <p> The goal , of course , is to make drug treatment more precise and effective . The conventional-treatment regimen starts with surgery to remove the tumor , followed by radiation to cleanse the surrounding tissues and chemotherapy to destroy rogue cells in other parts of the body . Because all the detectable tumor cells have been vanquished by the time chemotherapy starts , there is no way to tell whether it is actually doing its job . Some labs are now addressing that problem by growing patients ' cells in culture and testing different drugs on them . A more radical innovation is to leave the patient 's tumor intact during chemotherapy , and use it as a monitor . There are precedents for starting treatment with chemo rather than surgery ; French physicians have used drugs alone to treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumors with chemotherapy in order to avoid invasive surgery . The National Cancer Institute is now financing a study to compare the effectiveness of preoper-ative and postoperative chemo , but results are still a year away . <p> Staying alive : For women fighting meta-static breast cancer  --  a group whose survival odds are as dismal today as they were 50 years ago-the question is not how to improve future treatments but how to stay alive . Many of them now see hope in a common leukemia treatment called autol-egous bone-marrow transplantation . The technique involves taking a quart of marrow from the patient , giving her nearly lethal doses of chemotherapy , then reimplanting the marrow to restore her devastated immune system . The treatment does appear to improve two-year survival rates . But 5 to 10 percent of the recipients die from complications , and the benefits may prove short-lived . <p> From a public-health perspective , the greater hope lies in learning to prevent this awful illness . There is every reason to think much of it can be prevented . For while the specific risks are murky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevalent . Breast-cancer mortality is five times as high in North America and Northern Europe as in Asia and Africa-even among people of Asian and African descent . Prevention could prove difficult if it meant embracing the dietary and childbearing practices of the Third World . But for millions of American women , knowing that it works would be a start . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A disease that affects families : Denver patient and her husband <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Boston oncologist Dr. Susan Love with a breast-cancer patient : ' It 's an epidemic ' <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Concentrating a patient 's bone marrow in a lab . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) scan reveals a breast-cancer tumor ( white area ) <p> GRAPH : The Outlook <p> By GEOFFREY COWLEY with REBECCA CRANDALL in New York and MARY HAGER in Washington <p> The TRAM Flap Procedure <p> DIAGRAM : 1 After mastectomy , excess abdominal skin and tissue are isolated , along with a segment of muscle which maintains the blood supply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up behind the abdominal skin , out onto the chest wall , and then molded to shape the new breast . <p> DIAGRAM : 3 The nipple is often formed with tissue from the new breast mound .
