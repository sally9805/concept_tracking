Simple is often best . But as people who do their own form 1040s can attest , that is n't exactly a guiding principle of the U.S. tax code . So it 's a bad joke that the current debate over tax relief for investors centers on a cut in the capital-gains tax , the 28% levy that you pay on stocks , bonds and other assets held more than a year and sold at a profit . The bad part is that while it would be relatively easy to install  --  Poof ! Your tax rate is lower  --  what the Federal Government really needs to do is figure out a more complex but also more beneficial fix , one that adjusts for the ravages of inflation . Do n't get me wrong . A cut in the capital-gains tax rate is a good proposal . But simple is not best in this case . Indexing for inflation is a better plan , even if it 's too logical for policymakers . <P> The buzz for tax relief has rarely been louder , and is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More important , there is mounting grass-roots support for cutting taxes on investment gains . Thanks to a roaring bull market , and the fact that anyone with two nickels to spare is in stocks , Wall Street windfalls are no longer reserved for the rich . A survey by the NASDAQ stock exchange shows that the proportion of adults owning equities has doubled , to 43% , since 1990 . <P> The most prominent proposal for how to cut capital-gains taxes would exclude 50% of gains and tax the rest as ordinary income , effectively cutting the top rate to 19.8% . The change would apply to assets sold after May 7 , 1997 . Almost no one is talking up indexing stock profits for inflation as an alternative , because it 's seen as a record-keeping nightmare . It requires a different adjustment for every holding period . The goal of indexing is to eliminate taxation on capital gains that result from inflation rather than from a real increase in value . Say you buy $10,000 worth of a stock , and after a year its market value is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year was 3% , you effectively had no gain . Yet if you sell , you owe tax on the $300 nominal profit . Indexing for inflation would ensure that you pay on gains only beyond the $300 . Perfectly logical . A Congressional Budget Office study found that in 1989 the sale of U.S. assets generated net capital gains of $47.3 billion . But adjusted for inflation , those transactions actually produced losses of $17.4 billion . " People were paying taxes on sales where they lost money , " says Mark Bloomfield at the American Council for Capital Formation . <P> With inflation at its current low rate of 3% , the two alternatives are a wash for those in the highest tax bracket : a stock bought at $100 and rising 10% a year for a decade generates an after-tax profit of about $125 in either tax scheme . Now , all those who think inflation will remain at 3% forever , raise your hands . Hmmm , just what I thought . The risk is that inflation will pick up , and at just 4% annual inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals . That , unfortunately , translates into a cost for the government and may be seen as a budget buster.
