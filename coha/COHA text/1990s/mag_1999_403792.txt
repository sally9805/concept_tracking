Travis Ramos and a bunch of U.S. and Canadian freestyle skiers were crammed together in front of a television screen last February , watching the 1998 Winter Olympics . Just a step away from the 2002 Olympics themselves , the guys stared at their fellow athletes onscreen . As the USA 's Jonny Moseley made his final run for the gold medal , Ramos became most intent . Ramos and Moseley are pals , traveling companions and members of the U.S. Ski Team . So when Moseley delivered a gold-medal performance , Ramos and the other Americans exploded with yells and high-fives . Two days later , it was 19-year-old Ramos 's turn to vie for a podium ( topthree ) finish-as a moguls skier on the NorAm ( North American ) circuit , a level below the World Cup tour . Blasting out of the starting gate , Ramos 's skis bounced off each mogul , or bump in the snow , like a pinball . Again and again his legs and flexible-as-rubber ankles twisted sideways and his knees jammed into his chest . A UF.O. on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air to perform his best jump , the U.EO. or 360 Mute Grab . As he spins around in one complete turn , he reaches down and touches his ski binding with his left hand before his skis land back on the snow . " It 's the same trick Moseley did to win the Olympic gold , " Ramos says . " We hang in the air for about two seconds . It seems longer on TV because they show the trick over and over in slow motion . " His second-place performance was so good that , a month later , the U.S. Team turned him loose on the World Cup tour . That was a big break for one of the youngest members of the moguls team . Ramos jumped at that chance to competeand finished third-a huge accomplishment for a World Cup rookie. // <p>
