<p> WHEN we moved to Whitney , Oregon , the buildings that were left were weather-beaten and broken-down , survivors of an old mining and lumber town . Swallows flew in and out of the buildings and built their nests in the eaves . The sagebrush and the high , open sky shared the immense silence with a menage of swallows , coyotes , elk , great blue herons , and sandhill cranes - and us . <p> Into the silence of winter dropped the sounds of spring . The steady drip of the snow melting from the eaves and a warmer wind when I went out to milk in the mornings were the first signs . Geese flew and honked up the valley . And the raucous , rattling , prehistoric cry of the sandhill crane foretold spring 's arrival . <p> When these things happened , I began to look for Guy 's arrival . Guy had been making a seasonal route among Jacksonville , Whitney , and Greenhorn Mountain for at least 40 years . He arrived in his pickup with all his worldly goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the owner of the cabin across the road , where he would set up camp . His total setup time was one or two hours . <p> After we got to know each other he always called me " the missus " - a title that my friends deplored . I suppose it sounded pretty strange for a woman in her 30s to be called " the missus , " especially in the 1980s . ' Ms. " was in . " Missus " was not . But I knew that with Guy , it was an old ranch term of respect . For him , even though there were other women in Whitney , I was " the missus " of the valley . My husband , Jon , said that whenever Guy came to the house and I was gone he kept peering around Jon pointedly and finally would burst out with , " Where 's the missus ? " <p> When I saw the smoke rolling from the chimney of his little cabin , I knew that he was " campfire " cooking again . His morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt was to " bring out the flavor . " He cooked meat and then put it aside , without refrigeration . " Cooked meat lasts longer . " <p> Guy loved to fish , but hated to eat what he caught , so I was the happy recipient of trout from Camp Creek . But Guy was n't too interested in cleaning them either . Guy gave me my first fish-cleaning lesson , and although it was a job I never liked , I enjoyed being involved in the process of feeding my family from nature . <p> Guy kept a coffee can of small Milky Way candy bars under his cot . About twice a week I would tell our daughters , Juniper and Amanda , they could go to Guy 's and get a candy bar . To get there you had to look both ways , cross the dirt road , and run up the boardwalk to Guy 's open door . <p> Usually the kids would get their candy bars and run . But as they got to know him better , the visits lasted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homemade bread or cookies for Guy , I 'd find him telling them stories about his wandering life , or perhaps about the wildflowers . Guy loved children , wild creatures , and flowers , but had n't much use for grown-ups . <p> Despite his dislike of grown-ups , he enjoyed some of the projects Jon and I came up with . He helped supervise the carpet laying and thought it was a grand joke to hear Jon grumble good naturedly and to watch me ignoring it all and getting on with the business . <p> No doubt he was happy to live his own fuss-free life and congratulated himself on his wise decision regarding the marital state . <p> The Fourth of July was a grand occasion too , with Guy supervising the fireworks out on the dirt road in front of our house . He blithely ignored all cautions written on the fireworks and stood as close as he wanted . Respectful of his 81 years , and mindful of the fact that he 'd managed just fine without me for the first 75 of them , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireworks and stood over them . <p> Early in our relationship , after Guy had decided that he liked me , he and I went for a walk to see the first flowers of the year . We walked about a half-mile , and he taught me the names for widow 's grass , bird 's bill or shooting star , and harebell . <p> As we came to know each other better each returning spring , and as I became " the missus " to Guy , he grew more protective of me . When I was visiting one day he noticed a cloud of mosquitoes on my legs and became quite alarmed . He said that he always sprayed himself with Raid , then they did n't bother him . I looked at him in wonder and said that really , they did n't bother me anyway . Guy was insistent , however , and before I left he had sprayed a thick coating of Raid on my legs . I waved goodbye and proceeded over to the house and around to the backyard where my husband was pursuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs ? " he asked in horror . <p> " Raid . Guy wanted to help me keep the mosquitoes off . " <p> " Go into the house and wash that stuff off ! " Jon ordered , for once abandoning all husbandly caution and falling into the role of a father with an errant child . <p> WHAT same year I saw a car down at our next nearest neighbor 's house , about a half-mile away . I 'd promised to keep an eye on their place while they were gone . Jon was off working on the ranch , so I rambled across the street to tell Guy what I was up to . That was a mistake because Guy drew his gun from under his pillow and said he 'd come with me . All the protests in the world would n't change his mind , and when we arrived at our neighbor 's house I walked up the driveway with Guy behind me . <p> I wondered at every step about the absolute stupidity of my latest venture . What if Guy tripped and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun and there was an actual shooting match between this old man ( who I 'd silently sworn to protect and care for ) and some young , desperate athlete of a robber ? But the final event was peaceful and diametrically opposed to my overexcited imaginings . The door opened and a quiet , gentle woman came out . I introduced myself and recognized by her name that she was a close friend of our neighbors . Guy proudly showed off his shooting abilities , into the field , away from my back , and we went home . <p> Guy visited his sister in La Grande occasionally . They were good friends . She washed his clothes , cooked some hot meals , and sometimes went grocery shopping with him . Now and then she came to Whitney . She and I talked as she washed dishes in Guy 's dishpan on the stove . She worried about Guy , but he 'd always been so independent . " He left home when he was 14 and never came back , " she said . <p> Her good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while she and Guy would tell me their family stories , punctuated with chuckles and grins . <p> Guy returned one day from a visit with his sister after being gone for a week or so . That was longer than usual and I 'd been wondering about him . As he stepped up on the porch the sun caught his fly-away white hair and turned it into a sunlit silver aureole . His cheeks were pink and his penetrating blue eyes shown invincibly . " Angelic , " I thought . " Radiant . " He made his brief hellos and left . Guy never visited long . He liked most to be alone . <p> Our dog Thorn almost
