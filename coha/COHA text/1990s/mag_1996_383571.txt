The need for quality Black family entertainment is what inspired Cedric Walker to begin the Universal Big Top Circus-the nation 's only Blackowned , operated and performed circus . Walker and co-founder Cal Dupree , who is also the ringmaster of the circus and goes by the name " Casual Cal , " said they wanted to do something that would reflect a positive image for the Black community . " We live in a time when people are inspired to do more with their families . So I saw a hole , and I jumped in , " Walker , 42 , explained to JET . According to Walker , Universal Big Top is the first Black-owned circus in over a century , and it is a well-polished affair which takes a hip-hop , big-top approach to providing innercity youth with positive role models and a glimpse at a successful Black business .

It performed in Detroit 's innercity in May , and circus members were in the midst of an 18-day Chicago engagement in September when its founding fathers spoke to JET . Dupree explained that many of the people who perform the acts also came from difficult environments , but they found a niche that helped them break the cycle of disadvantage . Dupree cited The King Charles Troupe , a unicycle basketball act , and the Ayak Brothers as examples of overcoming disadvantages . The Troupe is comprised of men who come from Harlem and the Bronx in New York . The Troupe was the first Black act to perform for Ringling Brothers in 1969 . They stayed with Ringling Brothers for 19 years before joining Universal . The Ayak Brothers escaped the racial oppression and squalor in Cape Town , South Africa , ( before the country 's democracy ) through performing its unique trapeze act in the circus .
