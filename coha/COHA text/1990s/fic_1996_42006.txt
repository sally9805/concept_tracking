THE GHOSTS OF NATHAN BEDFORD FORREST and one of his thirty horses have been seen prancing down Front Street on their way to the old Gayoso Hotel , which is n't there anymore , either . Forrest single-handedly charged through an entire Union brigade at Shiloh , but I doubt even he could make it through the masses that flood Poplar Avenue outside the projects . When the sun sets , people in the Poplar Projects get restless , and nothing can keep them inside their HUD concrete cubicles . They swarm the streets , crossing anywhere just to get to the other side . There is n't much on the other side , only empty lots , a couple of burnt-out old houses , and a little strip of stores : Handy-Mart , Check Cashing , Liquor , Chinese Food . None of these looks welcoming , but they 're enough to pull such a mob into the street that you ca n't drive past except at a crawl . A man and a horse would probably have an even harder time . <p> There were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city in 1861 to outfit his own company , with himself in command . Life as a private in someone else 's company did n't suit him . He left again in 1862 , when the city fell to the Federals . He came back as a general on August 21 , 1864 , charging into town before dawn to lead a raid and scare the hell out of some soft enemy officers . He got away with 116 prisoners , 200 horses , and a Union general 's dress uniform , the Union general having jumped out the window and fled through the alley wearing only a nightshirt . Schwab 's on Beale Street used to sell replicas of the uniform , with hoofprints on the back . <p> The streets outside the projects are always packed with people who act as though they can not see the cars in their midst . Perhaps they believe they are invulnerable . Or maybe they recognize their mortality and embrace it . Maybe they want to get hit and killed , but it has n't happened yet . Still , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure them a place in history . <p> I can tell you about that : history is my business . Specifically , it 's chasing history , catching it , condensing it to about fifty words , and slapping it on a gray-and-black metal sign underneath the great tristar seal of this sovereign state . The official title is Research Consultant for the city of Memphis to the Tennessee State Historic Commission . In addition to Forrest , I 've chased scores of people you 've never heard of ; also Andrew Jackson ( founded the city with two other men in 1818 ) , John James Audubon ( cataloged hundreds of exotic birds while sitting on the bluffs overlooking the river ) , Thomas Alva Edison ( stationed here as an eighteen-year-old private in 1865 ) , Edward Hull " Boss " Crump ( ran the city as mayor and political kingpin for a half-century ) , Ida Barnett Wells ( driven out of town for using her newspaper to crusade against lynching ) , W. C. Handy ( wrote " The Birth of the Blues " in a club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now , inevitably , I 've been sent after Memphis 's other king . The assignment takes me to the Lauderdale Court Projects on Third , where Elvis Presley passed his fourteenth through eighteenth years . <p> There have been no reported Elvis sightings at the Lauderdale Courts , but Memphis is riddled with ghosts . Dr. King was occasionally spotted floating around his room at the Lorraine before they turned it into the National Civil Rights Museum . Boss Crump sometimes drifts through the corridors of the old city hall . Dozens of dead blues musicians have been known to strut down Beale Street at four o'clock in the morning . Elvis himself has pumped gas at stations all over town . But even his ghost wo n't go back to the projects . It 's just as well . No one there remembers him , or cares to . When Elvis lived there , the projects were segregated . A few years after he left , they were integrated . Now they are segregated again . <p> Forrest came home in 1865 , never captured but defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million-and-a-half dollars , " he said , " and came out a beggar . " He tried to go into the insurance business , but the risks were too high . The city was shattered . When the Federals finally left , yellow fever broke out . Forrest became diabetic and died in October 1877 , weighing less than a hundred pounds , leaving nothing for the fever . The state revoked the city 's charter and turned it into a " tax district " for over a decade . The fever dead were laid with Forrest in Elmwood Cemetery . <p> Elvis moved from Tupelo with his parents in 1948 . They followed the masses who swarmed up from Mississippi after the war , looking for their piece of the Good Life in the Big City . But they found that those scraps of the Good Life left in Memphis were in the pockets of a very few , and they were n't sharing . King came in the spring of 1968 to show support for striking sanitation workers-the start of his " Poor People 's Campaign " - and stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few in town that would have him . He was shot on the balcony , and buried in Atlanta . A cancer has eaten the city ever since . There is nothing left for a fever . <p> The State Historic Commission wants to put a plaque outside the Lauderdale Courts testifying to Elvis 's residence there . And they want me to get the facts . Most are a matter of public record . The lease is on file , and Graceland has photographs of Elvis as a teenager . But the commission has a standard procedure : Go to the site . Take pictures . Ask questions . You never know , they say . Some of the best information is passed down orally , they say . I do n't relish going to the projects . <p> Martin Luther King could and did walk anywhere in the city . It was said that his presence could stop a knife fight or a shooting . They thought nothing could touch him , because he touched everything . During one march down Beale , he glanced aside to admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few days later , the store had sold a gross of them . They could be seen downtown , marching down Main Street , resting atop heads that bobbed above signs that said : I Am a Man . <p> William Tecumseh Sherman was taking his family upriver on a steamboat in 1863 when his eldest son , Willy , fell sick with typhus . They carried Willy off the boat at Memphis and into the Gayoso , where he died a few days later . He was nine years old . Sherman was devastated . " He was that child on whose future I based all the ambition I ever had , " he said . " I will try to make poor Willy 's memory the cure for the defects which have sullied my character-all that is captious , eccentric , and wrong . " A few months later , he ordered Forrest killed " if it costs ten thousand lives and bankrupts the federal treasury . " <p> Elvis liked to play this game : he 'd drive up Poplar , late at night , until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usually an old black woman , staring in the window at the De Villes and Eldorados . Elvis would step out , approach the woman , and tell her she could take her pick . The next day he 'd make the calls and set the whole thing up . He gave away dozens of Cadillacs that way . Friends said he called it " Chasing the Dream . " <p> There are no Cadillacs at the Lauderdale Courts , not even dreamCadillacs . In one of the courtyards is the carcass of a ' 68 Impala . It sits there , stripped almost to nothing , a brazen violation of the rules . King never rode in Memphis ; he walked everywhere he went , the grand marshal of a parade of dignity . Elvis never walked anywhere , for fear of being mobbed and smothered . In time even his limousine could n't drive through the streets . When Elvis wanted to go out , he 'd do it on his motorcycle , face disguised by a helmet with a tinted mask . How he got in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mission . He said : " War means fighting , and fighting means killing . " The State Historic Commission wants me to walk around the Lauderdale Courts and see if anyone ever saw Elvis there . Sometimes I 'll walk down Front Street , to the spot where a plaque says the old Gayoso used to be , and try to imagine what that grand hotel looked like . It was burned down in 1899 , but no one seems to know how or why . <p> The people at the Lauderdale Courts call me " Pota " ; they think I 'm with the newspaper , though the paper has never sent anyone here before and never would . They stick to the Big Business downtown and Society out east . Their only use for a place like Lauderdale Courts is as an example of crime , degradation , and anarchy , and for that they need not visit . Most of their readers will never know the difference . <p> Many of them may have had an aunt or cousin who lived here when the place was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the Lauderdale Courts were a dream come true : indoor plumbing , electricity , new appliances , hot and cold running water . Maintenance courtesy of the Memphis Housing Authority . Rents that would leave you with enough to eat and dress your kids and yourself and even take in a show at the Orpheum once in a while . And a sense of community : whole towns would move up from the Delta and into the projects ; whites into one development , blacks into another . People who lived there could n't believe their good fortune . The government was taking care of them . <p> The government forgot about the sanitation workers , who were , to a man , black and paid so poorly that they could put in forty hours a week and still qualify for welfare . But King could n't forget . " All labor has dignity , " he said . " Everybody 's got a right to live , " said a popular song of the day . " I Am a Man , " said the striking sanitation workers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were a labor problem . <p> Forrest would n't have taken a penny from the government if they had offered it to him , which they did n't . His guiding principle after 1862 was to drive the government from Memphis-whether they were the commanders who kept shop at the Gayoso or the occupying forces of the Reconstruction , who seemed to do nothing all day but loaf around Court Square , cussing and spitting , their deep blue uniforms an affront to the Bluff City and all it stood for . Later , Forrest would be hoisted out of Elmwood and reinterred in his own park downtown , under a statue of himself riding a composite horse . The park is not safe anymore . <p> " Pota , " says a toothless old man whom everyone calls Rufus , " what you come here lookin ' for ? I can show you what you need to know . " <p> " I 'm not with the paper , " I say . " I 'm with the state . " <p> A half-dozen people quickly move away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With the Welfare ? " he asks . <p> " No , " I say . " The Historic Commission . " <p> " His-to-ry Commishee ? " someone else shouts . " You come to the right place . Ol ' Rufus here be History . Rufus so old , he a slave ! " <p> " Ai n't that right ! " says another . <p> Rufus ignores them . " So what you doin ' here , Pota ? " <p> " Elvis used to live in these projects , " I say . " I 'm trying to find out where he lived , exactly . " <p> " Egg-zackly ! " says someone . <p> " Fuckin ' Elvis shit , " says another . " Racist Motherfucker . Like to see his fat ass come back here now . " <p> " Stupid nigger , " says someone I ca n't quite see . " Elvis dead ! " <p> " Still like to see his fat ass walk on in here . " <p> " Been dead twenty years , stupid-ass nigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rufus , but he just shrugs . He 's been stumped . I 've done what I can , and now I can leave . I 'll have to stop at the National Civil Rights Museum on the way back . I need to use their archives for another assignment , this one on the first school for freedmen in Memphis . The museum is about two miles south of the projects , on the other side of Beale , the old border between black and white . Martin Luther King had no choice but to stay at the Lorraine . Very few motels in Memphis would accept blacks , or Negroes , or Colored , even in 1968 . Nat King Cole , Ella Fitzgerald , Duke Ellington , Dizzy Gillespie-they 'd all stayed there at one time or other . <p> " You come back now , Pota , " Rufus offers as I get into my car . <p> What is history ? History is the absence of the present . Or perhaps it is the presence of an absence . Either way , the art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little too late . Always showing up just in time to learn that you missed something significant . History is all about the missing of important things ; a historic marker is nothing more than a little sign to let passersby know that something happened , something worth remembering happened on or near the spot on which they now stand , but they missed it . If only they 'd been here earlier . . . This is my job . I am the first to verify that it is true , that something really did happen here ; I am the first to know-officially , according to the state of Tennessee-that I just missed it . Then I get to pass that sentiment on to uncountable future travelers , who will have just missed . . . me . <p> I love my job . It 's eating me up . <p> They say that in his last weeks , Forrest stumbled around downtown , delirious , flailing his bony arms at Union troops that were n't there anymore . " I am completely broke up , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , broke in spirit . " He was nearly blind ; gangrene had already set into both his legs . Fifteen years earlier , as he rode through a wall of bluecoats while covering Beauregard 's retreat from Shiloh , one of them shot him point-blank in the side , almost knocking him out of the saddle . But Forrest held his mount , grabbed a stunned Yankee private by the collar and pulled him up onto the horse , using the man as a shield while he slashed his way out . A witness said Forrest looked like " a singular gray devil . " <p> Fifteen years later he was merely one of thousands flooding streets that pulsed with delirium ; the yellow fever was taking hold . People ran around until they fell and died in doorways and on the cobblestones . Ninety-one years after that they would rise again for a few brief moments to proclaim their humanity before it was shot down by a man with a 30.06 and a scope . The poor people 's campaign was canceled for lack of funds . Forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper tells of a drug raid gone awry at the Lauderdale Courts . A policeman is shot in the chest but lives ; a drug dealer is killed , along with two innocent bystanders who happened to live in unfortunate apartments . One of them is Rufus Marshall , 67 , who had lived at the Lauderdale Courts for twenty-six years . The projects are rife with drugs ; this kind of raid is not unusual . In a week it will be forgotten or eclipsed . It will never merit a marker . Rufus so old he a slave . Eggzackly ! <p> Local legend holds that on June 5 , 1862 , the night before the Yankees took Memphis , some prominent business- and military men hosted a gala ball at the Gayoso . Forrest did not attend . The next day , Federal ships steamed down the Mississippi , lined up opposite the Chickasaw Bluffs , and captured the city with little trouble . A Union general took the Gayoso for his headquarters . After that , no decent Memphian would go near the place . When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We shall be more than satisfied to leave its sullied memory along with its ashes in the old century . " Three years later they built a new Gayoso , square and plain , out of brick . <p> After three years at the Lauderdale Courts , Elvis 's father , Vernon , had saved enough to buy a 1941 Lincoln . A few months later , the family left the projects for an apartment on Alabama Street , where their upstairs neighbors were a rabbi and his wife . Saturday mornings , Elvis would walk up to turn off the electric lights and do other chores forbidden to Orthodox Jews on the Sabbath ; then he and Vernon would go outside to work on the car . Years later the rabbi 's wife told a reporter : " They would polish that old Lincoln like it was a Cadillac . " One Saturday , the story goes , Elvis picked up his girlfriend and drove to Overton Park for a picnic . He parked in front of one of the mansions on Galloway ; while they were gone , someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It took Elvis weeks to save up enough to get it out of the pound . <p> The FBI got a room next to King 's at the Lorraine . They secretly recorded his conversations and other sounds , hoping to get enough to blackmail him someday . One agent testified that on the night of April 3 , 1968 , after a confrontation with police on Beale Street , he recorded King saying , " This is a mean town . We 'll be lucky to get out of here alive , " but the tape was somehow lost . <p> The Commission wants me to check at the Lauderdale Courts one last time . I ask about Rufus , not Elvis . Did anyone see him die ? Some people take me to his apartment . There is still blood on the floor and walls , a small body traced in masking tape on the carpet . <p> " You wan na see how Rufus die , Pota ? " someone says . " You wan na feel what he feel ? I show you . " He reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of a mortar . He holds it next to my head and cocks the hammer . The side of the barrel is cold against my ear . <p> " Here you go , Pota , " he says . He is young , in a slick warm-up suit . " Now you Rufus . " They laugh . I do , too . I do n't know why . <p> An explosion next to my head . A siren , steady , like a disaster drill . The Big One from the New Madrid Fault has finally hit : Front Street is crumbling down the bluffs , tumbling into the Mississippi . The earth is opening wide , devouring us ; the dead crawl up through the cracks . Elvis joins a tour at Graceland , unrecognized . King returns to the Lorraine , pays his tab , sees his last meal still sitting on the bed in room 306 . Forrest stares at his statue ; he does not recognize the horse . <p> They 're laughing , speaking to me now . I ca n't hear them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit points his gun at the floor , at the masking tape , and fires again , silently . They laugh some more . Something warm and wet seeps through the cracked drum and fills my ear and spills over , down the side of my face , like a big fat 1977 sideburn . <p> And then I 'm outside , groping in my pocket for the keys , lurching toward a car . Mine ? I pull out of the courtyard , turn up a wide street , into the setting sun . Short buildings and dirty open lots lope by irregularly . Tires scrape the curb . Liquor , Chinese Food . Elvis took fistfuls of pills and ate fried banana-and-peanut-butter sandwiches , a dozen at a time . King was stabbed in a New York department store by a crazy woman with a letter opener . Forrest had twenty-nine horses shot out from under him . <p> Shapes dart in and out of the windshield . A mass parts before me . I have been to the mountaintop . I have seen the promised land . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to know tonight that we , as a people <p> A thunk , and something hits the windshield and disappears . The tires stop ; there 's something in my hair , on my forehead , stinging . Open the door ; a boy , eight or ten , on the street , almost under the tire . A web the size of his head in the glass . A dark worm out of his mouth . <p> My knees hit the asphalt ; people run over and gather around , looking down . They have not seen what I just saw . For the first time in my life , I realize , I have not missed something . <p> Forrest said , " Git thar fustest with the mostest , " even though he probably did n't say it . <p>
