<p> Early last March at a Republican retreat in Annapolis , House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich ( Ga. ) made a small request of Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour . Would Barbour , Gingrich wondered , underwrite the cost of a political advertisement in TV Guide ? <p> It was late at night and a little whiskey had been poured by the chairman and he was feeling generous . He did n't even ask what it was about . Gingrich always had schemes . Fine , Barbour said , and that was that . <p> The discussion was perhaps the most casual moment in months of planning , polling and plotting of strategy that produced the House Republicans ' " Contract With America . " The document , unveiled on the Capitol steps in September and published in TV Guide in October , helped shape the political debate in the fall campaign , will define the early days of the 104th Congress and may determine the Republican Party 's fate in the next two years . <p> The 10-point contract  --  10 because Gingrich , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mythic quality in American culture  --  lays out one of the most ambitious 100-day agendas ever undertaken by a political party . <p> During the first 100 days , House Republicans have pledged to bring to the floor for votes legislation ranging from a constitutional amendment to balance the budget to tax cuts for business , middle-class families and senior citizens , welfare reform and term limits . On opening day , they promise to reform the way the House does business by requiring Congress to live under the laws it passes , cutting committee staffs , limiting the terms of committee chairmen and requiring a three-fifths majority to raise taxes . <p> The contract has been denounced by critics as a series of promises that either do not add up or will bring extraordinary hardship to the country . But that has done little to deter the Republicans , for the contract is not something they stumbled into by accident . It was the product of months of planning that included everything from polling and focus groups to consultation among Republican constituencies to analysis and scrubbing by GOP experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Rep. Richard K. Armey ( Tex. ) , who had the responsibility for putting the contract together and is in line to be the House majority leader . " We hope to pass every one of them , but we never made a guarantee we would do that . " <p> The contract began with an idea , hatched earlier this year in a meeting that included Gingrich , now the House speaker-to-be ; Armey ; and Reps . Bill Paxon ( N.Y. ) , chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee ; Tom DeLay ( Tex . ) , Robert S. Walker ( Pa. ) and others . <p> Republicans had concluded two things about the political climate . One was that they had an outside chance to take over the House in the fall ; the other was that the political climate was already so negative toward President Clinton that they needed a positive agenda to offer the voters . <p> " We consciously designed the contract to do two different things , " Gingrich said in an interview shortly before the Nov. 8 elections . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did win control for the first 100 days we would actually have a game plan and so that our freshmen would arrive and be involved in changing the city , not learning how to be part of the city . Second , we thought a positive party , standing on the Capitol steps , offering a positive set of things people actually want . . . would be a healthy antidote to the level of anger at Clinton and the level of negativism . " <p> Gingrich set the date for the platform 's unveiling , Sept. 27 , as a way to frame the final weeks ' debate in the campaign , dictated that the list be limited to 10 items and suggested Republicans pledge to accomplish all 10 within 90 days . Armey , as chairman of the House Republican Conference , which helps to set party policy , was deputized to coordinate the project . He recognized the Herculean nature of trying to do that much that quickly and suggested 100 days , according to one aide . <p> DeLay said there was a number of criteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to energize Republican voters . <p> Nothing was to be included that would split House Republicans and the congressional candidates . Almost immediately that ruled out any explicit mention of abortion . " Not that we 're not a pro-life conference , " DeLay said . " But we wanted to make sure we had as many candidates and incumbents as possible coming together to sign the contract . " <p> Every item had to be something Republicans could accomplish in 100 days . " We were n't going to promise something we could n't do , " he said . <p> Armey , for example , is a strong advocate of scrapping the current tax system and replacing it with a flat tax . " It 's too big for 100 days , " he said . <p> That is also why the contract does not pledge to enact any legislation , only to bring it to the floor , conduct an open debate and take a vote . <p> Even now , a number of senior House Republicans doubt the term-limits amendment will pass when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electoral upheaval , some Republicans , such as Armey , are having second thoughts about whether terms limits are even needed . <p> " Now , with Republicans in Congress , I do n't feel as much a need for it , but I 'll vote for it , " he said . <p> House Republicans had spent the first 18 months of the Clinton administration in weekly meetings trying to develop a set of ideas they could rally around , so there was at least a general sense of what any document would contain . But during the early summer , Republicans set about canvassing their candidates and the American people to find out which ideas had the most public appeal . <p> Ed Goeas , a Republican pollster , conducted three focus groups and showed participants a series of eight televisions ads that had been prepared to test various themes , ideas and concepts . <p> " The one thing that jumped out was that voters were looking for a mechanism to hold elected officials more accountable , " Goeas said . " The most important thing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Frank Luntz , another GOP pollster , was asked to prepare a questionnaire for all incumbent House Republicans as well as the GOP challengers around the country . <p> The eight-page questionnaire asked candidates to rank issues in two different ways ; first , whether they liked or disliked the idea , and second , whether including it in the platform would help or hurt politically in their district . The list included 67 specific items in 12 categories . About 100 incumbents and 120 challengers returned the questionnaires , Luntz said . <p> With the poll results in hand , Armey set up a series of working groups to winnow the list and flesh out the specifics in legislative language . The working groups were instructed to pay special attention to the interests of the challengers . <p> " The open seat candidates and the challengers were bolder , " said Ed Gillespie , an aide to Armey . " We wanted to err on the side of more bold , not less . " <p> The working groups had responsibility for outside consultation with think tanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Federation of Independent Businesses ( NFIB ) was one key group in urging the Republicans to make their tax and regulatory recommendations friendlier to Main Street than to Wall Street . <p> " We felt the economic opportunity part was fairly heavily tilted toward Wall Street , " said John Motley , who heads the NFIB . <p> DeLay , who headed the regulatory working group , said he consulted with " probably over 100 " mostly Republican groups . " Anybody who was interested , " he said . But he added , " Ralph Nader was not there . " <p> The winnowing process proved extremely difficult . There was a major battle over whether to include school prayer in the contract that pitted Gingrich against Armey . Gingrich did not want to include it and carried the day , then inexplicably thrust it into the post-election dialogue by promising a vote on it by mid-summer of next year . <p> But there were other big items that were excluded . One was a rollback of the personal income tax rate increases for wealthy Americans that was part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans disliked the tax hikes , the revenue generated by the higher rates proved too valuable , given other tax cuts the Republicans wanted to propose . <p> " We could n't afford to do the rollback , " Armey said . <p> Health care was not included because at the time no one knew how the debate over Clinton 's plan would turn out . Education was largely left out . <p> But with 67 specific items on Luntz 's list , there was heavy lobbying as Republicans tried to reduce the contract to just 10 items . In the end , they pulled a classic congressional compromise by folding multiple items into a single heading . That , for example , is why the first item , the Fiscal Responsibility Act , contains both the balanced budget amendment and the line-item veto . <p> Rep. John R. Kasich ( Ohio ) , who is in line to become chairman of the House Budget Committee , played a crucial role in blessing the arithmetic  --  even though it remains the most controversial aspect of the plan . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gingrich 's press secretary . " Later , he did the numbers and felt comfortable . " <p> Once the contract was completed , Republicans took it for another road test . Luntz conducted another survey to test specific language and held focus groups in which he tried out four different versions of the TV Guide ad , which cost a little more than $ 250,000 , including production . <p> The research produced some changes in language  --  " citizen legislators " was the term used to describe the effect of term limits  --  and resulted in the Republicans not describing the document as a " Republican contract , " a point that became controversial . <p> Gingrich picked TV Guide as the vehicle for promoting the contract because it had a shorter lead time than Readers Digest and because the typical subscriber would open up the magazine repeatedly the week it was current . The ad ran in the Oct. 22-28 issue . <p> On Sept. 27 , more than 300 House Republicans gathered on the steps of the Capitol to sign the contract before television cameras . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract war room in its headquarters that provided a steady flow of faxes , talking points and backup material to candidates . <p> " We had said for six months to our candidates , ' No matter what happens , you will be attacked in the final weeks by the Democrats on Social Security , ' " Paxon said . <p> The contract provoked that debate , but Republican strategists said that because the contract was unveiled in late September , they had enough time to counteract it . " We were saying , ' Do n't throw us into that briar patch ' , " Gillespie said . <p> With their majority in hand , the contract may prove to be a mixed blessing for the Republicans . Republican strategist William Kristol said that however valuable the contract was in shaping the campaign debate , it is even more valuable in giving Republicans a clear agenda for next year . <p> " In the absence of the contract , it would have been very difficult to get any focus or coherence , " he said . <p> But Kristol said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislation that supports the more general language in the contract , arguing that the public would not demand that every detail be legislated into law . <p> But will the public be satisfied if House Republicans produce floor votes on these 10 bills , only to see some fail or watch them be bottled up or defeated in the Senate ? <p> The attention the contract has received since the election adds pressure on Republicans to deliver perhaps more than they promised , Goeas said . <p> " The one thing that the members have to really deal with and understand  --  and it 's been said to them repeatedly  --  and that is no matter how you worded it , there was still an expectation that some of these would pass , " he said . " I have a feeling that this could take on a life of its own and expectations could be higher . The contract today is much more meaningful than it was even a week before the election . "
