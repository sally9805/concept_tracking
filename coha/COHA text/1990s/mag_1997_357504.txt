When Navy Secretary JOHN DALTON took delivery of Electric Boat 's first Seawolf submarine in July , he praised the ship 's stealthiness . He spoke little about its weapons systems , since it carries the same missiles and torpedoes as the Los Angeles-class subs it is replacing . Nor did he speak about how the Navy was helping to pay for Seawolf ( $2.4 billion each ) : by scrapping 15 Los Angeles-class subs this year and next , some of which spent barely half their 30-year life-spans at sea . The cost to the taxpayer : about $2.4 billion . <P> The Navy is doing this with other vessels as well . For example , 24 guided-missile frigates bought during the Reagan Administration for about $7.2 billion are being retired after spending only 46% of their projected life at sea . Eight will have steamed for just 14 years of their expected 35 years of service . <P> Critics say the early retirements will help finance a wholesale rebuilding effort . Indeed , in its 1998 budget , the Navy is seeking $3 billion to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It argues that Russia 's fledgling Akula and yet to be built Severodvinsk classes are " projected to outperform today 's most advanced Western submarines in many respects . " Someone should tell the Navy that the cold war is over . <P>  --  By Mark Thompson/Washington
