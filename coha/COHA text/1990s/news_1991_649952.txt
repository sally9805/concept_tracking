<p> In Anthony Trollope 's 1869 novel " Phineas Finn , " the story of a neophyte politician , a parliamentary veteran tells young Finn how things work : <p> " Many who before regarded legislation on the subject as chimerical , will now fancy that it is only dangerous , or perhaps not more than difficult . And so in time it will come to be looked on as among the things possible , then among the things probable ;  --  and so at last it will be ranged in the list of those few measures which the country requires as being absolutely needed . That is the way in which public opinion is made . " <p> Trollope captured the political process in cynical shorthand in that paragraph , and he captured , too , how public opinion has been made on the question of war in the Persian Gulf . Some have moved slowly toward the inevitability of war . Others have edged closer and closer to demanding the return of the troops . Recent polls show a nation split down the middle . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion that leads to public opinion  --  and public disagreement  --  has been one of the great hallmarks of this action . We 've played out military scenarios , analyzed polls and plumbed history , more like folks researching a Tom Clancy novel than plunging headlong into war . <p> There 's been nothing knee-jerk about most of our citizens . When he took the temperature of the South on the conflict this week , B. Drummond Ayres Jr . of The Times was moved to write , " The word that came up most often was ' doubt . ' " <p> And yet most recently the Government has decided that its questioning people should know less , not more . The Pentagon says that if war comes , all stories will be reviewed by officers in the field , and all combat reporting will be done by pool reporters accompanied by military baby sitters . <p> You do n't have to be in the business to understand how this affects coverage : inhibiting the go-getter who is never chosen for the pool , providing reporters glimpses only of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewed . The Defense Department says all this is for security reasons , a rationale that has a familiar ring . Sure sounds like spin control with a capital C to me . <p> Other guidelines were dropped , but they telegraphed what the Pentagon is after . All interviews with military personnel would have had to be on the record . Any reporter can tell you that some of the best information comes from people who want the truth out but do n't want to take the heat for providing it . The best known of those was a person called Deep Throat , without whom we might still believe that Watergate was a third-rate burglary . <p> What people keep demanding when they consider this war is more , more , more . More information about Iraq and Kuwait . More information about our national interests and the probable cost . I keep remembering John F. Kennedy 's anger at David Halberstam , the foreign correspondent who won a Pulitzer Prize by reporting not what the Government said , but what was really happening in Vietnam . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " complained the President . <p> There are some stories that demand that reporters get as close as they can , standing in as they do for everyone at home . That 's all we are : stand-ins , permitted to go places most people can not go so that most people can be there through words and pictures . <p> War correspondents have always been mindful of security restrictions , and they have had an excellent record of policing themselves . Vietnam taught us that when the press and the military make a bargain , the press to be cautious and the military to tell the truth , those with the notebooks keep their end better than those with the guns . But it also taught us that telling the truth about war can shift public opinion toward peace . That 's what the Defense Department fears , particularly with this war , so wreathed in the gray smoke of national doubt . <p> No matter what happens in the Persian Gulf , we will know one thing about ourselves . And that is that we have learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peaceful solution , many people and philosophies will be given the credit . But one great player will have been the people of this country . If there is war , the Government can not expect them to go back to the sidelines . Their stand-ins must be there . The cameras . The reporters . If we do this awesome thing , we should know what it is that is being done in our name . That 's what the people need . That 's what the press must provide . And it 's what the Government should allow . That 's how public opinion is made .
