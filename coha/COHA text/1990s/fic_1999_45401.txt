1981 <p> Dr. Piquette is one of the main speakers at the biennial conference of the International Association of Child Psychiatry , in Paris this year , and she looks great-probably in her forties with a cascade of auburn hair and shining eyes , wearing a pale pink suit . There 's a vase of irises on the lectern next to her paper which is about a new approach to child therapy that involves working with the child-patient in the presence of his parents ; it 's therapy with an educative spin to it . Edgar , listening , fantasizes going out to dinner with Dr. Piquette or better yet , going to her apartment for the evening . Yvonne , he 'd say , why do n't you show me where you live . Two years ago the conference was held in Oslo ; he could n't go because his marriage was falling apart . <p> So , he 's been divorced for over a year . After twenty-four years of marriage he dared to shake up his life and it was n't because he had another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward in the second half of his life and become less discriminating . He wanted to be more loving , more yielding strange idea with its connotations of passivity , of femaleness , of perhaps even homosexuality . A few of his colleagues congratulated him for leaving a sad marriage as though he were leaving one of those small , confining countries with a reputation for bourgeois dullness like Belgium or Luxembourg or Liechtenstein . As for himself , he did n't see the move as bold but as excruciating . The fact was that along the way he 'd caused suffering . <p> Dr. Piquette finishes her paper . Child psychiatrists ca n't leave parents out of the treatment process . There 's a way of connecting with children , a way of thinking about them-that parents can learn from the body of knowledge that we take for granted . And there 's so much we can learn from parents . The room rings with applause-a medium amount , actually-and Dr. Piquette steps down and takes a seat in the audience . Off the podium she 's not quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable-looking men take their places on the platform to respond to Dr. Piquette 's paper . In Edgar 's opinion shrinks like to ponder ten sides to every question . Everything strikes them as interesting , never as wonderful . Freud complained that Americans knew so little about anything except their professions ; they had no breadth of curiosity , no interests or hobbies , no passion for history and art and travel . He worries that Freud was describing him . <p> Edgar misses seeing Yvonne 's animated face . He can only see the back of her head now , a glittering diamond-y clasp holding a knot of thick hair . The vase of irises remains on the lectern but without her , the flowers look artificial . If ever he should remarry he wants a woman who thrives on work . He does n't want to be the center of anyone 's life . Betty blamed him for so much of what she did n't dare to do . <p> After the respondents respond-and only one is truly generous to Dr. Piquette 's ideas-Dr . Piquette herself is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues . He can see that there 's no way she can leave the conference , even though he 'd love to be shown around the city by a native like Dr. Piquette , taken to her office as well as to her home . Mostly , he 'd like to go to bed with her . He notices the lithe way her body sways as she holds forth with a few young psychiatrists . When she laughs she turns her head up to the ceiling and then glances disapprovingly , in jest of course , at the person who makes her laugh . That little gesture beguiles him . <p> What do you know about Dr. Piquette ? Does she have an extensive practice , does she teach ? Is she married-or otherwise attached ? Those are the topics Edgar wants to discuss . At lunch in the banquet room the Boston contingent teams up with the small delegation from Philadelphia . The talk is about how Dr. Piquette 's approach compares to family therapy . " Yvonne seems to take a rather didactic approach , " says a well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who referred to Yvonne as Yvonne . How did he get on a first-name basis with her ? " Bob , do you know Yvonne ? " he asks . Yes , he met her in Oslo two years ago . They stayed at the same hotel . <p> Edgar , suspicious that Bob knows Yvonne all too well , that he 's slept with her during those short but intense Norwegian nights , urges Bob to tell what he knows about the attractive Dr. Piquette . For instance , is her husband prominent in the French psychoanalytic crowd , in with the disciples of Lacan ? Is she really old enough to have studied with Anna Freud ? <p> " Her husband was a brilliant researcher for one of France 's best pharmaceutical companies <p> " Are they divorced ? " <p> Bob speaks softly . " She 's a widow . " There is a hint of disbelief in his statement , which Edgar shares . <p> " How did her husband die ? " Edgar asks , pressing forward injudiciously . <p> " I know nothing about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Does she have children of her own ? " <p> " Edgar , gim me a break . " <p> " What I meant was , what was it like in Oslo ? " Bob eyes him curiously , and Edgar clarifies . " I mean , what was Oslo like ? " <p> " A nice clean modern city . Friendly , helpful people , a beautiful park with sculpture . . . Edgar , why do n't you just go over to Dr. Piquette after lunch and introduce yourself . I 'm sure she 'll be delighted . " <p> " Do you think I should ? " he says , turning awkward and adolescent . <p> And when the conference reconvenes after lunch , Edgar maneuvers into a seat next to Dr. Piquette . In the process she nods and smiles , glances up at the ceiling innocently , pretends that she noticed not at all the way he 's sticking to her side like glue . <p> The first speaker of the afternoon session , from Atlanta , presents a paper about the ramifications for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorous divorce with no outward fireworks . " After the respondents complete their remarks , the audience , drowsy now from a rich lunch and hard listening , stand and stretch . Dr. Piquette waves to a distinguished-looking man a few rows behind , a man whom Edgar recognizes as the newly elected president of the Association , Laurent Beauvais , a man he 'd spent some time with at a conference in New York four years ago . Reflexively , Edgar says , " Oh you know Dr. Beauvais ? " He suspects , of course , that they 're lovers . " Laurent is my cousin , " Yvonne says , " and he 's told me what a fine paper you presented at the conference in New York , " and then she stuns Edgar by inviting him-Edgar ! - to have a drink with her at a nearby cafe . The sun is still shining , and she 'd like to get some air before heading back to her office . This evening she works till nine . <p> On the way to the cafe Yvonne changes her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fragrant ; it 's May , and Paris is intoxicating . She suggests that Edgar stroll with her to her office , a thirty- or forty-minute walk . She needs the exercise . Edgar is overjoyed . Busloads of tourists crowd the streets around stolid old Notre Dame cathedral ; not far away people are standing in line for ice cream cones . <p> As they stroll the two doctors talk about their training and consultancies in various clinics and nursery schools . It 's true , she worked in a nursery school in London where Anna Freud was one of the directors . It gives her a sense of historical legitimacy to have been so closely connected to Sigmund , although she 's strayed far from the master . " I 've moved far away from the fanciful theories of my teachers , theories that in my opinion had more to do with art than with reality . " <p> He gives a sidelong glance at Yvonne and is certain that she understands an entire set of propositions about life that he has yet to grasp . Whereas he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basics . However , Dr. Piquette offers no confidences about her personal life : nothing about the death of her husband , or whether she has children , or about the kind of music or food or films or vacation spots she likes . And nothing Yvonne says would betray any interest in his personal life . In fact Yvonne is absolutely quiet , but her hip brushes gently against his . Oh lucky him ! They cross the bridge that spans the Seine and he drinks in the sensations of late afternoon . The indulgent air of spring ; light of sweet butter , the unburdensome touch of her body . Her loneliness and his . Not a single bird swooping , not a single child sobbing . He 's at peace with himself but also very much alive , with a current that charges his body , that makes him desire her enormously but does n't turn him into a billy goat . After all , in a month or two he 'll turn fifty . <p> Challenged by her reticence , he asks her to have dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she replies , " I 'm so sorry , I have plans to go out with my cousins tonight , Laurent and Annette Beauvais . " Blushing slightly , she glances up at the sky and then looks at Edgar as though by inviting her he 'd done something slightly naughty but pardonable , something endearing . Her eyes sparkle . <p> " What about tomorrow evening ? " he blurts out . He has one week in Paris . The conference ends in two days and he 'd planned an extra five days for a brief vacation . " You see , " he says , " I 'm here alone , " and then , just in case she has n't realized by now that he 's not a married man on the make , he adds , " I 've been divorced for over a year . " <p> " How kind of you to invite me , " she replies . <p> " I 'm not with anyone , " he repeats , a fact that is almost 100 percent true . A couple of months ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a freelance writer , who runs six miles a day , six days a week , and has the pulse of a fifteen-year-old . A bright , smiling woman in her mid-thirties who 's never been married , never had children , and whose two parents are alive and well . <p> " But Dr. Leopold , what makes you so sure that I 'm alone . " She lets go of his arm and faces him . <p> " I do n't know whether you are or are n't , " he says , lying . <p> " That 's hard to believe-since everyone seems to know my story . " <p> " What story ? " Edgar asks . " Besides I 'm only asking you out for dinner . " <p> Yvonne laughs softly , and says , " I 'll tell you whether I can accept tomorrow morning at the conference . " She extends her hand for a handshake but it takes Edgar a few seconds to take it . He expected her whole warm body . <p> They part ways in front of her building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . He strolls through the park , nods to a gendarme who seems to be on patrol  --  to patrol what ? the orderly patches of fenced-in grass , the fenced-in sandbox , the fenced-in tiny playground ? There 's a line of trees that have been clipped into military perfection . Do trees need patrolling ? Childhood and nature are under control in this city , and he 's amazed at how happy that makes him . An empty bench beckons . Nearby an old woman is reading a dog-eared copy of Les Miserables , but the sunlight is beginning to fade and she keeps glancing at him as though she wants to strike up a conversation . Within moments he rises and hurriedly heads off to find a cafe where he can linger for a couple of hours . <p> At a quarter to nine he makes his way back to the building where Yvonne has her office . The sky is a violet-blue that 's been painted over a layer of gold . For the time being the city is glazed in stillness , and there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . Soon Yvonne will emerge from the building unless , of course , she lives in her office . But that ca n't be . He 's pictured her in an elegant apartment with pastel  --  painted cherubs on the ceilings and huge vases of irises , anemones , and tulips , and well-framed paintings up and down the walls like in the Louvre . He paces back and forth in front of the doorway . The underlay of gold in the sky is less luminous now . In the course of the next hour no one emerges from the building except a mother and young girl of about seven , and then a little while later , a woman with short gray hair and a raincoat . By now it 's almost dark . <p> Not finding Yvonne at the conference in the morning makes Edgar irritable . He sees it as a portent of his ultimate failure to find the new rich weave of experience he craves . Not only experience but growth of character , as well . Most of all , he wants to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man who had he been a gentile would have hidden Jews in the attic of his home during the Holocaust , shared his rations , emptied their chamber pots , risked his life without thinking twice . All these possibilities , these ways of growing , reside in whether Yvonne will go out for dinner with him tonight , take him home and go to bed with him . A little magical thinking-he 's not beyond it . He cranes his neck to find her , and at that moment Dr. Laurent Beauvais catches his eye and signals that he wants to have a word with him . He has a message from Dr. Piquette . She 'll be here at one , she had to hospitalize a fifteen-year-old girl early , early this morning . <p> And indeed Yvonne does appear at one . She seeks him out , stays by his side as the entire group of psychiatrists enter the dining room , fanning out to the ten or so round tables in their efforts to seat themselves advantageously . Yvonne leads the way . She 's wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know , " he says while they 're eating white asparagus wrapped in a transparent slice of ham , " I was n't truthful yesterday . Someone did tell me that your husband had died . I 'm so terribly sorry . " <p> " It 's not a secret , of course , " she says ; " it 's more that one 's losses evoke nothing but cliches . " Edgar is worried that he 's already uttered some pathetic cliche in Dr. Piquette 's presence , but she almost seems to know that , and says , " Of course there 's nothing anyone can possibly do or say . There 's no easy way to console another human being , as I was reminded early this morning . The child survived but did n't want to . " <p> Yvonne stops speaking . A stillness takes hold of her , as though a breeze of fresh air looped and swirled its way around her like a chiffon scarf . A wistfulness , a breath of life from another time , another place . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge but then he thought the breeze was blowing up from the river . <p> After a while Edgar remembers his mission . " Have dinner with me tonight , " he urges . " Let me take you to a good restaurant-your suggestion . " <p> " Edgar , you seem like a lovely man , but I 'm not the kind of woman to have a little love affair with . I 'm not the person you 'd enjoy going to bed with . " She 's not harsh ; in fact her expression is one of concern ; compassionate in a way that makes Edgar feel like a kid who 's used a dirty word he obviously does n't understand and the grownup feels saddened by his innocence , and its imminent loss . <p> Again it 's because he does n't know the story . The story takes on the shape of a heart , turns into their private valentine . He wants to know the story almost as much as he wants to go to bed with her . How can he love her if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things she has to teach him ? <p> Although he again urges her out for dinner tonight and then for tomorrow night , she declines , as though she 's protecting him from herself , but the excuse she uses is the emergency that roused her so very early this morning . Instead she offers to show him around the Luxembourg Gardens for an hour or so . But Edgar does n't want acts of charity . He 's losing his patience . He may not exactly be the century 's greatest lover , but goddammit he 's a vigorous , sexy middle-aged man ; besides , they 're obviously attracted to one another . There 's not a reason in the world to hold back . His two children are just about grown and his parents have died . He 'd welcome an updated edition of his life , a revision ; call it Volume II , if you want . Leopold Leaves or Leopold on the Loose or Leopold Lightens Up . He 'd be happy to go into practice with her here in Paris . He could advertise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of employees of big American companies ; or diplomats ' kids . But Yvonne 's only invited him for a walk in the Luxembourg Gardens , and of course he accepts . <p> They stroll on tree-shaded paths and are lured to watching children sail their tiny sailboats in a large circular pool . They 're both transfixed by the cheerful scene , particularly by one devilish little boy who is pushing his poor grandmother to the absolute limits of her patience . He gallops away from her at top speed , practically falling into the pool , then races back and hugs her . Yvonne laughs softly to herself . " The fresh air has revived me , " she says pleasantly ; " why do n't you come to my office at 8 : IS and we 'll go out for dinner . I have seances till eight tonight . " She uses the French word for therapy sessions , seances , and he pictures her in black with a flowered shawl and a turban , communicating with the spirits of the dead . Maybe that 's what therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , talking everyone and everything back to life . He 'd like to speak with his mother , who died when he was twenty-two . You reach a certain age , he realizes , and there 's absolutely no one to blame . His throat tightens . His mother would simply not understand his leaving his wife and family . A sense of shame swamps him . <p> A moment later he 's overjoyed . He 's going out with Dr. Piquette tonight . He has that slightly heady , slightly uneasy giddiness that comes with getting exactly what you want . Please God , let me be happy with getting what I want . <p> He waits in the doorway of her building till 8 : zo and then punches in the special entrance code . Upstairs she ushers him into a modest-sized waiting room . " Welcome , " Yvonne says , " welcome . " But it 's not Yvonne , not the same woman . This woman has short gray hair , wispy and flat ; eyebrows that are darker ; cheeks that are pale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't known her long enough to be absolutely sure she 's the same person he left a few hours ago . " Hi , " he says . Then he forces himself to say Yvonne , half-convinced that the woman will say , I 'm not Yvonne , I 'm her older sister from Bordeaux . Or , I 'm her cousin Laurent 's wife , Madame Beauvais . <p> " Edgar , " she says , " can I get you an aperitif , a kir , perhaps ? " She unfolds a panel of louvered doors that conceals a row of miniature kitchen appliances and cabinets . If her little patients fantasize that she lives here in this office , that she belongs to them day and night , this time he 's sure they 're right . He scans the waiting room , with its couch and glass coffee table , and chairs . The couch is a pull-out couch where she sleeps . Behind it , near the concealed kitchen is a small wooden table with a straight  --  back chair : that 's where she eats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , " she urges ; " sit down and let me get you a drink and you can tell me about your work in Boston , or we can gossip about our dignified colleagues . Or about politics . Poland-you 've read about Lech Walesa ? Do you hold out any hope for Solidarity or do you think the Soviets are getting ready to invade ? I pray that they do n't . " <p> He ca n't open his mouth , ca n't converse . Reason tells him that she 'd been wearing a wig , but his mind balks . Where is the rosy , sparkling Yvonne , where is the spacious old-fashioned apartment ? He forces himself to speak , and what comes out is a stale topic , one that 's buzzed around the lunch tables every single day of the conference . " What do you think of Mitterand 's victory ? Were you surprised that he won , considering it 's his third try for the presidency ? " <p> She 's sharp enough to realize that he 's stalling for time , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into reverse . He can see her nimble analyst 's mind moving through the possibilities , and then her female intuition finding the answer . " My hair shocks you , does n't it , Dr. Leopold ? " <p> " It caught me off-guard , " he admits , defrosting his emotions with effort . To be honest , he prefers the wig . Slowly his thoughts begin to flow and it occurs to him that she 's had cancer and undergone chemotherapy , but he knows , also , that she would n't want to talk about it . Trying to make light of it , he says , " It 's taken me a while to be sure it 's really you . " <p> " Poor Edgar , " she says . " You can see that I 've come through a serious illness . You 're an observant fellow . " <p> The compliment warms him . Of course he 's observant . Shrinks are n't mind readers , they 're simply alert . <p> " I 'm restored to good health , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glances at her breasts and abdomen . Is she missing bodily parts ? He ca n't bring himself to ask her about her illness ; instead he asks whether she 's had this office for a long time . Fifteen years , it turns out . She rises to show him the actual office , which is complete with toys as well as a desk piled high with books and papers . The toys are shabby , not cute and colorful in bright reds and blues and yellows the way they are in the States ; the philodendron is scraggly . Yvonne excuses herself for a moment . He 's drawn to the partially open window and stares out onto the small park . The gendarme is still on patrol . The trees are behaving . <p> Yvonne reappears in long auburn hair with the diamond-y clasp in the back . She 's touched up her makeup , rouged her cheeks , and put on a dark green wool jacket . " Are you ready for dinner ? French food or North African ? " <p> Within fifteen minutes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yvonne make all the decisions about food and drink . The waiters are Algerians , better-looking and sweeter than French waiters , the atmosphere kinder . He loves seeing her relax as the wine hits her system . Over salads with goat cheese , they talk about the new conservative governments of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan , about inflation , about a new film with Burt Lancaster , whom she always enjoys , called Atlantic City ; and a conference they discover they both attended seven years ago in San Francisco . She can recall the topics of a few of the papers delivered at the conference and has some observations about their long-term usefulness . He sees the pleasure she takes in her own mind . The waiter brings a single ceramic bowl of lamb , and Yvonne serves him a nice portion . Over shanks of lamb on couscous and a mild house Burgundy he tells her that she reminds him of a fellow student in medical school , a brilliant young woman who graduated at the top of his class . <p> " But I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her eyes sparkle , and the fact that she reminded him of the young woman from his past makes her feel desirable . He wishes he 'd told her to forget the wig . <p> " Etty . Her name was Etty Weiss , " he says . " I have n't thought of her in twenty years . She was slightly older than the rest of us-and of course in those days there were only a few women in medical school . " Memories blossom forth : she wore sandals with leather thongs that cris-crossed halfway up her legs and a long black skirt . She never smiled . <p> " Was she German ? " <p> " German or Dutch , I 'm not sure . Jewish . " He observes Yvonne 's face closely to see how she reacts to his saying Jewish . He suspects all the French of at least a tinge of anti-Semitism , and of course he 's Jewish-he assumes she realizes that . <p> " I 'm not Jewish and I 'm not brilliant so why does she remind you of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any good shrink , to follow his associations , although now she seems slightly apprehensive . <p> He 's struck with how modest she is , how she would n't want to be thought of as brilliant , or outstanding ; however , she wants to hear more about Etty Weiss-anecdotes and tidbits that attest to her own appeal . His mind tries to conjure up Etty . Once he was in anatomy class with her and he was sure that he caught her whispering ( it was more like conversing ) to her cadaver . Her hands were trembling , and a few minutes later she looked feverish , then white , whiter than usual . Had he heard the word momma ? Unlike the rest of them , she never made jokes about the cadavers she worked on . " Etty seemed like a brave woman , " Edgar finally says , " like you . " <p> His reply pleases Yvonne , and she makes that beguiling little gesture , glancing up at the ceiling and then looking at him with playful disapproval . " Who is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to be weak or cowardly . One must go forward . " She takes a small piece of bread and carefully soaks up the gravy on her plate . Etty Weiss never joined classmates in the hospital cafeteria . She brought food from home-dry sandwiches on whole wheat bread . Liverwurst or bologna . She lived alone . He 's impatient with himself for thinking about Etty Weiss during this wonderful , unhurried dinner . He wishes he still smoked . <p> They 're both quiet until the waiter appears . They 've ordered fruit for dessert , and the waiter brings a bowl of winter fruit , not the cherries and peaches and strawberries of spring . Yvonne chooses a pear . After she 's peeled it , she leaves it whole and gleaming on her plate . " You do n't know my story , " she says . <p> " I know of your husband 's death , " he reminds her , wondering whether her husband had killed himself , or what long illness he 'd had , or some terrible traffic accident . His curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark-eyed young man sidles over to their table and wordlessly tries to sell him a single cellophane-wrapped rose for the lady . He buys it for Yvonne , reminded of how he 'd imagined her in her elegant apartment amidst vases of fresh flowers . She sniffs the rose but it has no scent and she does n't quite know what to do with it . A creeping wave of anxiety branches out through his body . Table and chair imprison him . It 'll be ages before the waiter brings the check , then takes the check , then brings the change . L'addition , s'il vous plait . He excuses himself and goes to the men 's room . Do you tell a woman you want to go to bed with , a woman who also happens to be a trained analyst , your dreams ? He had a dream in the early hours of the morning . As he approached a curb , a well  --  dressed blind man asked him for assistance crossing a busy avenue . He told the blind man he could help him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man took his arm as they stepped off the curb ; and when they reached the middle of the street , Edgar left the man and hurried on by himself , left him with the cars and trucks roaring by him at top speed . All day the dream rumbled around the edges of consciousness . But I 'm only a fallible little human being , not a saint , a small quivering voice argued in his defense . <p> " I 'm curious about what happened to your brilliant classmate ? " Yvonne asks him when he returns to the table . She 's cutting up her pear with a knife and fork . <p> " I do n't know , " he replies . " She was going out with a black orderly in the hospital at the time , and some of us wondered whether she 'd gotten pregnant because by graduation she 'd put on a lot of weight . But most of the time we ignored her . She seemed grown up and we were still kids . She 'd been through something we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were wiseguys and smart-alecks . Do you know those American expressions , Yvonne ? We said whatever came to mind . Our parents believed we had endless possibilities for success . The world was our oyster . My parents worked hard in the grocery store they owned , but I never had to pay a penny for my own education . " <p> " It was n't easy to be a woman in medical school when I went , " Yvonne says , " but we were all struggling to live and get by ; that struggle was equal . It was n't that many years after the war . " <p> " I was surprised when my daughter chose to go into art history , and not medicine . " " You have a daughter ? " <p> " A daughter and a son . In their early twenties . My son did n't speak to me for six months after I left his mother . My daughter called me a coward . " <p> " A coward ? " <p> He shrugs . He 's never understood why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get her to see that he 'd been the opposite . <p> " I 've just remembered that the orderly 's name was Alvin , " Edgar says . " He kidded around with the medical students . Made us feel better when a patient took a turn for the worse . " <p> " Etty 's boyfriend ? " <p> He nods and some tension that hovered over them seems to pass . He pays the waiter with crisp new franc notes he 'd gotten from the bank that morning . <p> Outside the restaurant the sky is dark but there 's still light around the edges ; a lack of conviction about darkness in this city . They pass the park and walk towards her building . Suddenly he senses that Yvonne is exhausted . He holds her around the waist and guides her down the street , and she lets him . There 's no question that he 's going upstairs with her , and in fact he wishes he could pick her up and carry her . In a matter of minutes she 's become frail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it her home ? Inside , she crumples onto the couch , still wearing her green jacket . Her thick auburn hair looks like a hat made of wool . He wishes she 'd strip off the wig and be herself . Ta-da-c'est moi-with short , gray hair . <p> Yvonne is n't thinking about hair . She 's turned hard , almost angry . Her face is drawn . " There 's an enormous difference between us , " Yvonne says : " your son did n't speak to you for six months . My sons will never speak again . " <p> Taken aback by the harshness in her voice , he realizes that what she has to say is part of the story he had n't known , the story he 'd wanted so much to hear . " How come ? " he asks quietly . <p> She shakes her head , she ca n't tell him and he does n't press her because the God 's honest truth is that now he is n't sure he wants to know , but she ca n't hold back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and two boys . A little boy and a grown-up boy . " <p> Edgar finds himself in front of the louvered cabinets , unaware that he 's hoping to find a bottle of cognac , of anything . Another kir would be fine . He asks her if she 'd like a drink ? She does n't hear him , and he pours the two of them some cognac . <p> " My little boy died when he was nine , of childhood leukemia , almost fifteen years ago . The grown-up son died in an accident eight months after his father died of a heart attack over two years ago . People either do n't believe me or they 're shocked into silence and then they try to find some comforting words , and there are n't any . " <p> He 's frightened and speechless . He ca n't believe it . He feels as though the floor 's dropped out from under him , and there 's been an earthquake that measures 8.4 on the Richter scale . There 's nothing to say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Deep sea diving off the coast of Guadeloupe , " she replies , on automatic . " He went on vacation , " she whispers , seemingly embarrassed by that twist of fate ; and then as though she needed to protect her son against charges of recklessness , she adds , " He was an experienced diver ; his equipment failed . " <p> Edgar brings her a small glass of cognac , and sits down next to her . She 's scarcely breathing , almost in a trance . He struggles to find something to say , and the strange thing is that in spite of her stoniness , she seems to know he ca n't bear the silence , but with her finger against her lips she orders him not to utter a word . He experiments with gently trying to snuggle her closer to him . She 's unbudgeable . In shrink jargon he says to himself , Sit with the pain , Edgar . Sit quietly and bravely . But sitting with this much pain terrifies him . Also , having to sit with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't help feeling a tiny bit sorry for himself . Then he thinks about Yvonne : no person should have to lose all the people they hold dearest ; and suddenly in his mind 's eye he sees Yvonne 's body without breasts . Concavity ; scarring ; the body pared away . He scares himself into stopping all images . Soon his own stillness soothes him . He does n't dare move . He ca n't say that he feels close to Yvonne , or pretend that he 's offering her any comfort at all . He stays close to her for what feels like ages until she comes to life , opening her eyes and standing to take off her jacket . Without saying a word she manages to communicate that the couch they 're sitting on unfolds to become her bed . <p> Minutes later when she emerges from the bathroom in a Chinese kimono , her own short gray hair , her face scrubbed clean of makeup , he has n't moved , although he 'd been tempted to call out goodnight and walk out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take notice of him now , but enlists his help in converting the couch to bed . She tosses two pillows onto the bed . He could head for the door if he wanted . She turns her back to him and slips out of her robe and quick as a flash gets under the covers . She has the long torso and short legs typical of French women ; she has one breast , not two . In moments she appears to be sleeping , and nothing more is required of him . He pours himself a drop more cognac and turns off the lights . Then he enters the darkened office , a room that seems to be only resting momentarily between human dramas . <p> At the partly opened window , staring out at the deserted park , he carries on a mental conversation with the sleeping Yvonne . It 's more like a question-answer session , and he 's asking all the questions . How do you manage to remain so hopeful when you 've had so much sorrow ? Are n't you afraid ? How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own children , and can work truly satisfy ? There 's no end to the questions he can come up with . <p> As his eyes become accustomed to the dimness , he seats himself in Yvonne 's desk chair . He discerns toys in her office he had n't noticed earlier in the evening , and can imagine the parade of children who use them , can sense the troubles they try to unravel . At a certain level of engagement and trust , children become earnest about their own therapeutic work . They 'll keep their own treatment chugging along . This suffices for now , he imagines Yvonne saying . <p> The night air blows in , damp and faintly sewer-y . The idea of fleeing , so powerful a short while before , vanishes . He 'd like to build a wall against his own future sorrows . He listens for sounds of Yvonne sleeping , and closes his eyes , leaning back in the chair , willing himself to sleep . He does n't sleep . His body is a pile of stones , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built . The soft glow from the streetlights keeps the room from total darkness . He removes his shoes , puts his feet up on an empty corner of Yvonne 's desk , and soon drops off into a dreamless doze . And some time later he hears Yvonne get up to go to the bathroom and before she gets back in bed she spots him at her desk in the next room . " Ah , you 're still here , " she says , neither startled nor alarmed ; " I was so tired I do n't remember turning the lights off . " <p> " You did n't , " he says . " I did . " <p> " Why did you stay ? " She dashes back to her bed and slides under the covers . " Do n't answer ! " she quickly commands him . Comfortable again , she pats the blanket next to her , her hand like a small white dove about to take wing . " Come here , my friend . " She sounds rested , refreshed ; physicians can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in bed and hold her , he knows ; and she does n't want words of comfort . The worst part of being alone is to go on day after day without being touched by another human being . For all his silliness , he 's learned that much . And he wants to hold her , wants her to rest against the solid warmth of his middle-aged body . He considers keeping on his underwear , then remembers that Yvonne is naked . He undresses . Angling his arm under her head , he gathers her up against him , aware of the sweetness of one human being 's flesh against another 's . She has only one breast , her left . With him next to her Yvonne asks , " Edgar , remember the little boy at the Luxembourg gardens-the one who was racing around the pool and teasing his grandmother ? " <p> " I remember him . " <p> " You do ? " She 's surprised , and tests him to be sure . " What was he wearing ? " <p> He remembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You 're absolutely right ! " she exclaims . They begin , inexplicably , to laugh . " So much spirit , " she says ; " and handsome . " She settles even closer to Edgar until he can feel her stomach and groin and legs tight against him . He kisses her head , her forehead , her nose . She raises her right thigh between his legs . His hand refuses to go near her breast , afraid his fingers might press , by chance , into a tiny hard lump . Instead he caresses her back , the long expanse of smooth silky skin . Ah , Yvonne . <p> They 're going to make love , he 's ready . They 're going to make love and enjoy it , he can tell . But in the morning he 's going to change his airline ticket and not stay the extra five days in Paris . Holding Yvonne in his arms , he knows , and believes that Yvonne also knows , that he 'll go home and marry Lisa , the freelance writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , energetic Lisa Merrill , who runs six miles a day , six days a week . He 'll be married to Lisa Merrill before the year is out . <p>
