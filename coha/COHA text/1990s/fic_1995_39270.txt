In the village of Rossiniere , in Switzerland , Ann is handed a piece of gold leaf to eat . <p> " It 's good for the digestion , " Cecile tells her in her accented English . " It 's good against arthritis , too . " <p> Both girls laugh . Both girls are too young to worry yet about arthritis . <p> " I eat it all the time  --  an expensive habit . My parents would be furious if they knew , " Cecile says as she goes back to the lamp she is restoring and to which she is applying the gold . Her strokes are quick and sure and she uses a curious instrument with an agate head to make the gold shine . <p> Ann shuts her eyes and puts the gold leaf  --  a little gelatinous and more like mercury than gold  --  into her mouth . The gold feels like paper and , because her mouth has gone dry , she has difficulty swallowing it . With an effort , she forces the gold down and feels its uneasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This is Ann 's first time in Switzerland and her first week in Rossiniere where she is living with Cecile and her family for the summer . Cecile 's family owns an antique store that specializes in Swiss hand-painted furniture , which they restore and sell . The painted furniture reminds Ann of American Quaker or Pennsylvania Dutch furniture , only it is more artful , more intricate . The armoires and chests in the Cottier 's store as well as in their house have elaborately painted scenes , landscapes with churches , castles , people , carriages , animals . The colors , too , are a surprise : bright mountain greens , vivid sky blues , startling blood reds , nothing like the more sober and muted Quaker and Pennsylvania Dutch colors . Ann 's bed in the Cottier 's house , for instance , is decorated with lush garlands of blue and red flowers that inspire her with an unaccustomed gaiety . Already , Ann claims that she sleeps better here than she does elsewhere . <p> " Funny , " Ann has told Cecile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , you know , kind of dour and sad . Instead , it 's very lively , it 's very  --  " Unable to think of the proper word , Ann blushed , stopped . <p> In addition , Ann likes the Swiss furniture because each hinge , each fastening and joint , however old , still works simply and perfectly , and Ann says that , for the time being anyway , she prefers craftsmanship to invention . Also , she says she likes the fact that all the furniture is clearly dated . Josef et Marie-Therese Henchot  --  1785 is painted below the garland of blue and red flowers on the headboard of Ann 's bed so that she does not need to speculate or guess , or , in turn , be wrong . <p> Cordial and noncommittal with Ann , Cecile 's parents , M. and Mme. Cottier , too , right away include her in their routine with neither surprise nor , as far as Ann can see , any adjustments . Their lack of curiosity about her and her family , Ann attributes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first evening volunteered that she was a twin , Mme. Cottier did not immediately ask Ann if her twin were identical or fraternal , as everyone else always did . <p> Instead , the conversation around the Cottier ' s dining room table tends to remain general and devoid of those personal remarks and innuendos Ann resents in her own family ( although one time , Mme. Cottier did mention Cecile 's short  --  no , shorn  --  hair , and with a look of long suffering on her face said to Ann : " You should have seen her hair before Beautiful thick hair Now , she looks like  --  how can I say ?  --  one of those poor people , one of those victims " ) . <p> Mostly , however , the talk is about food . M. and Mme. Cottier discuss the quality of the Gruyere and whether it has aged properly , the butter and whether such-and-such a dairy is better than another or whether it has fallen off in quality ; they speak about the peaches and whether they are as good , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ' s peaches , and Ann can not help but think of her own family 's meals and how everyone bolts down his food without a word , barely tasting it , as if eating were a chore rather than a pleasure . Still , Ann is amazed that such a banal topic proves inexhaustible and that even slim Cecile , who looks as if she ate nothing but celery stalks , joins in the conversation with enthusiasm and eats twice as much as Ann ever does . <p> In her hiking boots , Cecile 's slender legs look thinner , longer . Also , she is wearing short shorts . <p> Ann is wearing jeans . <p> " Where are we going ? " she asks . Then , since Cecile does not answer , Ann says , " I love to walk . " <p> Early afternoon in early July ; the road that runs through the village of Rossiniere is almost deserted  --  too soon in the season yet for tourists  --  only an occasional car passes them . Most of the cars in Switzerland , Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geraniums , she thinks . The window boxes of the chalets in Rossiniere are filled with geraniums , the blossoms are full , large . Gladioli , peonies still , sweet peas , snapdragons , and weedless rows of vegetables fill the gardens that border the road . In the last garden , an old woman dressed entirely in black is hoeing . Slowly , she straightens herself up and , leaning against her hoe , she watches the two girls , Ann and Cecile , walk past . No one says a word . <p> " I like your hair . Really , I do , " Ann says to Cecile . <p> Before Ann has a chance to say anything else , a car drives up  --  no exception , the car is red  --  slows down , stops , honks . The young woman sitting next to the driver rolls down her window and gestures with her hand . For a moment , Ann thinks she and the driver are friends of Cecile , but Ann can see out of the corner of her eye that Cecile has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road and is crawling underneath it into the adjoining field . <p> " Ici , est-ce bien la route pour  --  " the young woman calls out to Ann in halting French . <p> " Excusez-moi , Mademoiselle , mais nous sommes bien sur la route de  --  " the young woman tries again a little louder while Ann continues to stare at her . No mistaking the young woman 's accent . <p> " Cecile " Ann starts to call out before she turns away . She can feel the eyes of the couple in the car on her as she crawls awkwardly under the fence . A barb snags the sweater she has tied over her shoulders , the wool tears as Ann pulls it free . <p> Cecile is halfway across the field . " Who were those people ? " Cecile asks Ann when Ann catches up with her . " Tourists , " she says before Ann can reply . <p> The field has not yet been mowed and it is filled with tall grasses and Queen Anne 's lace . The Queen Anne 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she reaches down and touches the tops of the flowers as she walks . Some of the flowers are pink . She is tempted to stop , to pick them . Ahead of her , Cecile has started to sing a song Ann recognizes immediately . <p> " Like no other lover  --  " Cecile 's voice is loud , mock impassioned , her accent even more pronounced . <p> " Something in the way he moves  --  " Ann starts to sing along with her . <p> " I love the Beatles , " Cecile tells Ann when they are finished singing . <p> " It 's a great song , " Ann agrees . She has almost forgiven Cecile . <p> In front of them , at the far edge of the field filled with Queen Anne 's lace , tall dark pines rise almost parallel to the side of the mountain . <p> Following the path up through the trees , Ann walks directly behind Cecile . The blue sky overhead is hidden from view by the tall dark pines and , except for the occasional snapping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazed how quickly the countryside has changed  --  twenty minutes from the village of Rossiniere with its red geraniums , and they are in no man 's land , as remote , Ann thinks , as a jungle . Above them she can hear but not see a jet , no doubt a commercial airliner , and she imagines the passengers in their seats , perhaps sipping cocktails and admiring this view from above , feeling safe as they fly over Switzerland . <p> Looking ahead at Cecile , Ann worries about whether Cecile has ever gotten lost on a walk . The dark trees frighten Ann a bit and it might take hours , days even , Ann thinks , before someone would find them , especially , say , if one of them were to fall and break her leg . Cecile 's legs would snap in a trice they are so thin . <p> Ann also wishes that they would talk as they walk . So far , Ann knows very little about Cecile . Ann would like to know , for instance , if CEcile has ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fellow student , an artist . He painted large abstract canvases filled with yellow bubbles . " Yellow is a difficult color . After van Gogh  --  " Farah had shrugged his bony shoulders , given Ann a sad smile . Life , too , for Farah was difficult . In America on a grant , Farah was afraid he would be sent back to Libya , would have to stop painting . Ann sympathized  --  it would be unfair . But when her parents found out about Farah , to hear them talk about it , Farah and Qaddafi were one and the same . Nothing Ann said could placate them . The angrier they got , the more determined she was to defend Farah , like a cause . Eventually , Farah did have to go back to Libya and Ann went to Switzerland  --  a neutral country . But from Switzerland , Ann secretly fantasizes she can go to Libya  --  it is a lot closer . This is a notion Ann clings to for her self-esteem and is not anything she has the courage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees , it is colder , windier . The sky , too , is no longer blue , but gray , almost white . Ahead of them , Ann sees a moraine of stones . The stones are loose and slippery and are covered with patches of last winter ' s crusty and now dirty snow . CEcile holds out her hand to Ann and together they cross the moraine . <p> " We are nearly there , " CEcile says . <p> Ann stops , both to catch her breath and to put on her sweater . As it turns out , the hole made by the barb is right over one of her breasts . Ann sees CEcile look at it and look away . <p> CEcile is pointing toward the rocks that form the top of the mountain . At first , Ann is afraid that Cecile means that they must climb up there . The rocks are steep , sheer . Then , all of a sudden , Ann sees something move . Then something else moves . As her eyes grow accustomed to looking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , at least . <p> The way the chamois stand , flat against the rocks , reminds Ann of those extinct villages she has seen pictures of in the National Geographic that are carved into and perched on the sides of mountains  --  long ladders are strategically placed in front of dark doorways , windows , yet the villages look totally inaccessible . <p> " I was hoping they would be here for you to see , " says Cecile . <p> Standing quietly next to CEcile , Ann watches the group of chamois . They were absorbed in eating  --  tufts of dried grass , moss , lichen growing on the rocks  --  but now , as if sensing the two girls ' presence , the leader raises his head , looks around . Then , leisurely , not in any kind of a rush caused by fear , all the chamois start to move on . They jump further up the mountain , first one , then the next one  --  the chamois look as if they are jumping almost at random , with no specific purpose except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another , Ann can see neither ledge nor foothold . They float gracefully in the air , feet tucked in , head and antlers contained , and land lightly and neatly , daintily . Occasionally , a chamois dislodges a stone and the stone rolls noisily down the rock face . <p> CEcile nudges Ann with an elbow . <p> The last chamois in the group lands on his knees . When he stands up , one of his front legs does not touch the ground . The leg dangles . <p> " Oh , my God , " Ann says . <p> The chamois 's broken leg crumbles underneath him as he lands on it again . Precariously perched on his knees , the chamois struggles to get back onto his three legs ; when he does , without pausing or hesitating , he jumps to another rock . Ann watches the chamois do this several more times  --  jump , fall to his knees , get back on his feet , jump again  --  as he tries to keep up with the other chamois . The other chamois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace nor in any way acknowledge that there is something wrong . It is almost too painful for Ann to watch , while , for the chamois , there seems to be no connection between his broken leg and his falling . He just keeps jumping  --  jumping from rock to rock is what a chamois does , like breathing , Ann thinks . Even if something were to go wrong with one of her lungs she would still have to keep taking breaths . <p> " I 've never seen a chamois with a broken leg before , " CEcile says to Ann on their way back down the mountain . <p> " Terrible . He wo n't survive long , " Ann agrees . <p> And , in a rush of words , Ann tells CEcile about Farah , about how she met Farah , about how immensely talented Farah is and how he must be allowed to continue painting , about how her parents are prejudiced and have forbidden her to see him , about how much she loves him  --  Ann has never loved anyone else the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although as she says all this to CEcile , Ann does not feel so unhappy . On the contrary , she feels happy to be confiding in CEcile . <p> " I wish you could meet him , I am sure you would like him , " is what Ann is saying to Cecile as the two girls emerge from the trees and once again start to cross the field filled with Queen Anne 's lace . <p> " Shall we stop here for a minute ? " is how CEcile answers Ann . <p> Obediently , Ann sits down next to CEcile in the grass while CEcile busies herself picking the flowers within her reach . <p> " Last year , at just about this time , in July , a man gave me a lift in his car . I was hitchhiking . I always did  --  it 's so safe here , " CEcile is saying . In her hand , she holds several long stalks of Queen Anne 's lace and she waves the flowers at Ann . " He was French , I think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A tourist . " CEcile shrugs her thin shoulders and gives a little laugh , at the same time that she starts to gently brush Ann 's brow with the bunch of Queen Anne 's lace . CEcile brushes Ann 's nose with the flowers , Ann 's mouth , Ann 's chin . " He was the reason I cut off my hair , afterwards . I did it myself . I did it with nail scissors . It took me all afternoon , my hair was so long . My parents did n't know . I never told them . " <p> The flowers tickle , but Ann does not move . Ann does not speak . Ann , probably , does not breathe as CEcile brushes Ann 's neck with the Queen Anne 's lace , and , lower down , as she brushes the place where the hole in Ann 's sweater is . <p> " We 'd better get home , " CEcile finally says , throwing away the bunch of Queen Anne 's lace and standing up , " or we 'll be late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is both worried and upset that the dinner she has been preparing will be spoiled , overcooked . M. Cottier is busy trying to choose the proper red wine to serve with the meal . When finally M. Cottier has opened the wine , a Dole , and they are seated at the table , CEcile tries to explain to M. and Mme. Cottier . <p> " You see , " CEcile says as she cuts into the duck 's pink breast , " it was my fault . I took Ann for a walk up the mountain and on the way home , we hitchhiked-I do it all the time  --  and this man gave us a ride in his BMW . He was a tourist , a Frenchman , I think , or , maybe , he was a Belgian . " <p> Avoiding Cecile 's gaze , Ann lowers her head . She , too , busies herself cutting the duck meat . <p> " He would n't stop the car when we asked him to , " CEcile continues in an even voice . " He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept right on driving , is n't that right , Ann ? Lucky for us , the barrier was down at the railroad crossing , and Ann and I opened the door  --  we were sitting in the back seat of the car  --  and we jumped out . " <p> " CEcile , " Mme. Cottier says , " how many times do I have to tell you not to hitchhike ? You never know what sort of person is going to give young girls a lift . " Then Mme. Cottier says , " It is n't overdone , is it ? One must be so careful when one cooks a duck . One moment the duck is too rare , the next moment the duck is dried out . " <p> " I told you , did n't I , how I am a twin ? " Ann suddenly turns to and asks M. Cottier . " Peter , my twin brother , is exactly forty minutes older than me , and , actually , when I was born , my mother had no idea she was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my mother swears she did not have a clue . Neither did the doctor . My mother swears that after Peter was born the doctor thought she was through , he was taking off his mask , his gloves , he was about to leave the room , when , all of a sudden , one of the nurses called out after him : ' Wait a minute Here comes another one " <p> Without looking over at Ann , M. Cottier takes a sip of his wine and says , " I should have opened this bottle earlier , I should have let the wine breathe . " <p> That night , Ann does not sleep well . She does not sleep at all . Instead she tosses and turns in Josef and Marie-Therese Henchot 's pretty painted bed . Once when Ann opens her eyes she thinks she sees Josef Henchot standing next to the bed . With rough red hands that are more accustomed to milking cows , he is unbuttoning the row of small silver buttons on his short-sleeved black velvet peasant jacket that is exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time . <p> The next morning during breakfast , M. and Mme. Cottier talk about an old armoire that has come up for sale . M. and Mme. Cottier say that they have had their eye on this particular painted armoire for a long time  --  no one builds or paints armoires like this one anymore  --  but the old man who owned it refused to part with it . <p> " What made him change his mind ? " Ann asks . <p> " He died , " Mme. Cottier answers , spreading more honey on her slice of bread . <p> The armoire , Mme. Cottier is sure , comes from Fribourg ; the armoire , M. Cottier is certain , has never been restored , and never in all his years of dealing with Swiss antiques has he seen an old armoire in such good condition ; the armoire , M. Cottier also says , should bring him at least one hundred thousand francs . <p> When he finishes his breakfast and gets up from the table , M. Cottier takes Mme. Cottier by the hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm around Mme. Cottier 's waist , and , together , they do a little two-step dance . CEcile claps her hands . Then , standing up , she goes over to Ann and takes her hand . <p> " No , no , " Ann shakes her head , " I ca n't dance . " <p> Nonetheless , Ann lets CEcile pull her to her feet . <p>
