NIELSON PELKY SAID TO MY FATHER , " Personally , I do n't give a rat 's ass . If it were up to me , I 'd deliver the mail . " But it was n't , so he passed our house and waved to my father , who was watching out the kitchen window and did not wave back . <p> The town was growing and August Darby was replaced by a new postmaster from downstate who announced that his carriers would abide by U.S. postal regulations or be fired , rural route delivery included . At first my father said , " Screw that noise . " He 'd lived at this same address for over twenty years , and Nelson Pelky knew him well , and he knew me , too , and my mother , who had recently left us . But he said it meant his job , and if he could n't see the numbers marked clearly on the box or on the house or on the garage , then he could n't leave the mail . " I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father argued common sense . " I know all that , Tommy , and I 'm on your side , but I ca n't stop here . " <p> I was eating lunch , and my father saw me peeking at him and he stood suddenly , and with his back to me he said , " Finish up and come on outside and help me , " and he put his coffee mug on the table and 1it a cigarette and nodded to me to make sure I 'd heard him , and I said , " Yes . " I said , " I 'm all done , " and I wiped my mouth and got up and put my dish and glass in the sink and followed him down the backstairs and out into the garage . That 's where he stored the paint , the gallon cans dusty and dented , and you could tell the different colors by what had dripped across the labels . <p> " Here , " he said , and handed me a can of bright red . Then he picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent the bristles back and forth until they softened some , and then he turned the brush handle down and slid it into his back pocket . <p> " Stirrer , " he said , and he reached for one higher up , but it was stuck to the wooden shelf . ! started to shake the can of paint but he said , " No , do n't do that , " as though the cover might fly off . But it would n't have . It took him going almost all the way around the lid with a screwdriver , and when the lid did come off , there was this skin he had to puncture , a rubbery red skin , but the paint underneath was fine , and I liked the smell . <p> Mostly my father did n't give two hoots about the mail , but he was . waiting now for a letter from my mother , so he gave in and painted those numbers , 835 , across the two white doors . It took him a good half-hour , and when he stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those from the road , " <p> " From Lansing , " he said , but I did n't get what he meant , and I said , " That 's a long way , " and all he said back was , " Yeah , a long way , " and he walked off after turning and heaving the empty can across the dirt road and into the ditch . I moved up closer to the numbers , and they were much taller than me , and I was tall for twelve years old . <p> " Yeah , " I yelled , " for sure they 'll see these in Lansing , " but my father let it drop , saying nothing . Then I heard him say , " Bastards , " as he dabbed the metal flag on the mailbox with what little paint he had left on his brush . He left the flag up so it would dry by the time Nelson Pelky stopped next morning , which he did , but only to ease the flag down . I could tell it was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . He waved to me , sitting on the porch stairs , and I yelled , " Hi Mr. Pelky , " and after he drove off my father stepped outside and touched my head , and I looked up at him and said , " No mail . " <p> " You sure ? " he said , and I said , " Maybe tomorrow , " but I knew what he was waiting for would n't arrive , not this time , most likely not ever . My mother did n't want him finding her , which is why she left so late at night the way she did , my father working the graveyard shift at the sheet metal plant . She sat on the edge of my bed for a long time , explain , ing nothing but saying over and over how she loved me very much , and that someday I 'd understand . Then she kissed me and rubbed my back real gently and I did n't cry , not right then I did n't . And she said for me not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door behind her when a car drove into the driveway , killing its lights . " I 'll be back for you , " she shouted from outside . " I promise I 'll be back . " And then I heard her say , " Oh , God , " and then the trunk slam , and then the two car doors , and she was gone . <p> That happened over three weeks ago , and I missed her something terrible , but I was awful mad at her , too . My father had lots of sick days coming , and he started taking them , and his vacation time , too , so he had over a month to stay home , and he spent most of it near the phone , which almost never rang . Once a wrong number , and once my Grandpa Eby called , and all my father said was , " Lynette 's not here . No . " He said " no " again , and a third time , and then he hung up . When it rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And Nelson Pelky left only bills , which went unpaid . And my father started drinking more , and he did n't shave often or go to the laundromat . All the towels were dirty , and it got so I 'd have to dry off with a T-shirt after getting out of the shower . When his good friend Paul Tremblay stopped by late one night he told my father , " You look like shits " <p> " Get out , " my father said . " Get the hell out , unless you know Where she is . " <p> " I do n't , " Paul said , " nobody in town does , " and he said he did n't know who the guy was either . Then he said , " Listen to me , Tommy , I 'm no goddamn private eye , " and my father grabbed him by the shirt front and backed him hard against the refrigerator , my father 's elbow wedged under Paul 's chin , all this right in front of me , and I shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I was crying , balling my eyes out , and I sat down on the floor in the corner of the kitchen , my face in my hands , and when I looked up a few minutes later my father was crying , too , and Paul was gone . My father tried to talk , but he could not . Then finally he said , " She 'll write to us , and we 'll go pick her up , wherever she is . She 'll come home . " ' <p> But I knew if she did , it would n't be to stay . She 'd left before , I do n't know how many times , but always for only one day and always to the Cottage Motel . My father even learned to joke about it , saying , " Your mother 's at the Cottage , " like it was a vacation spot or something , like she 'd gone off to the lake or the mountains for a rest . But the motel was just down Route 28 , right outside of town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tremblay once told me , " A woman who issues a man his walking papers do n't just go to the Cottage . She ups and leaves town . " Which my mother never did . Until now . Now it was all different . Now there was another man involved . <p> If my father found him , he 'd beat him up bad , maybe kill him . The guy most likely did n't know my father could dead lift over 500 pounds . He proved it one year at the state fair , coming right out of the crowd , and he won fifty bucks . People clapped , and when he stepped down from the platform he was counting his money . Then he put it in his wallet and smiled and rubbed his fingers through my hair . My mother was holding his shirt , which he put on and buttoned , and she held his arm when we walked off across the fairgrounds because that 's when we were all happy . <p> Maybe I was five then , small enough to still ride on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peep up there , watching all the different colored lights on the amusement rides and the people passing and Smiling up at me . My mother would nod to them and reach up and pat my bare leg . She 'd say , " Having fun ? " and I 'd say , " Yes , " but that was before they hurt each other . <p> My father was first . He hit her one evening right before supper , I do n't even know what for , and then he stared for a long time at his hand , stared like it was n't a part of him , and when my mother finally turned from the cupboard , her nose was bleeding from one nostril . She wiped the blood away with the back of her hand . " It 's okay , " she said to me , and she sounded very calm . " Your father did n't mean it . " <p> " No , " he said , " I did n't , I did n't mean it , " and if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She spoke first . She said to him , " Turn down the burners , " and he did , all the way to off , and all with his left hand , the one that had n't struck her , and she left to go lie down on the couch in the living room , pulling the white afghan over her , snug to her chin . " I love your mother , " he said . He said , " I 'm sorry , " loud enough for her to hear , but he did not go to her . He walked outside , and I stayed seated at the table . I turned my head and I could see my mother , and she was shaking real bad . " Mom ? " I said , and she got quiet , so I called her again , and she said , " He did n't mean it , Sweetheart , " which I knew was true , and that he really was sorry , but that nothing in the world could ever change what had happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unused dishes from the table , then the silverware , knowing we would n't sit together as a family , not that night we would n't . I drank a glass of cold water and ate peach halves right from the can and , without saying good night to anyone , I went to bed . My window was open halfway , and I could hear my father singing " Jamaica Farewell , " his favorite Harry Belafonte song . I wondered if my room was listening . She loved it when my father sang , and so did I. He had a beautiful , sad voice , and I hummed along to the words , my cheek kind of vibrating on the pillow : <p> preI 'm sad to say I 'm on my way , I wo n't be back for many a day , My heart is down , my head is turning around , I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town . Now she was gone to Texas . That was the postmark on the certified letter the lawyer sent . It came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day shift , so I would n't have to be alone at night . Nelson ? elky let me sign for the letter  --  he said he owed my father that much , but he seemed nervous , so I said to him , " I 'll be sure he gets it . " Mr. Pelky nodded and drove off . I knew he could get into trouble if I opened it , but I did anyway . My mother was filing for divorce and asking for cus-tody-my full name was right there in black and white among all those legal terms . I slid the letter back in the envelope and folded it into my back pocket . Then I walked around back of the house and lined up a bunch of empty beer bottles at the edge of the lawn and got the .22 out of my father 's closet and racked the first round into the chamber . Then I filled the dip and , outside , I steadied the rifle on the porch railing and sighted down that long barrel and popped one bottle after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I took aim on it , too , but it , was way out of range , gliding downwind with the heavy clouds . <p> It was feeling a lot like fall , and ! spun around and , from the hip , I fired into the metal drum my father used sometimes for burning papers and boxes . And I went around front to the road , and although I did not squeeze the trigger , I pretended to pepper the mailbox with a million holes , blow it right off its post , and then shoot it some more on the ground like it was a wounded and dangerous animal . But all I did was walk up slowly and lower the shiny red flag with the barrel tip , as though there had been no mail . " It sure ai n't the goddamn numbers we painted , " my father would most likely say when he got home , and I 'd say back , " Nope , they can read those from the state capitol , " and he 'd smile and nod to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish , more than anything in the world , that my mother had written a letter of forgiveness , saying that she was sorry , too , and that she 'd come home now to talk it all through . <p> My father did not want to grow even one day older without her , but he knew what was what . In his heart he did . Twice this last week he 'd said to me , " You 're all I 've got now , " but I knew if they got him into court , he 'd lose me , too . If the judge asked me who I 'd rather live with I 'd say , " Both of them . " I 'd tell the truth and say I did n't like my mother running away all the time and that my father sometimes scared me with his temper , but that he cooked all my meals and played catch with me in the backyard and , at night , over an open fire , we 'd roast marshmallows , and he 'd tell some funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they asked , I 'd say my mother had some nerve saying my father was n't fit to raise me . <p> He 'd promised to take me to see Ben Hur when it came to Munising , about a haft-hour away , and when he got home from work one day he said , " Let 's go . " He said , " Step on it , Buster Brown , we 're on our way to the movies . " <p> On the drive over he talked to me a little about my mother . He said life was too short to fritter away , waiting for a woman , even your own wife , if she could n't make up her mind . It 's not like he 'd adjusted to being without my mom , but he did seem to be doing better . Until halfway through the show he did , right after Ben Hut won the chariot race . I could tell that my father loved that scene and , I guess not thinking about where he was , he lit a cigarette . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nobody shouted down for him to put the cigarette out . And he did n't , not even when the usher told him to . Instead , my father took a long , slow drag and tilted his head back and exhaled , the smoke blue and floating through the beam of the projector light . I said to him , " It 's okay to smoke in the lobby , " but he got mad and flicked the butt up at the big screen , and it was as though he 'd spooked those six white horses who reared and whinnied , Ben Hur straining against them , heavy on the reins . <p> " Let 's go , " I said , " come on Dad , " and when I turned my head I could see the manager coming , his flashlight on . He should n't have shined it in our eyes because when he did my father grabbed it and stood up and threw it at the screen , too , and the light made a loud clunk when it bounced off and hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome they 'd hang scum like you up by the balls , they 'd feed you to the swine . " <p> Right then the theater lights along both walls came on , and the projector stopped , and the manager said , " Please , just leave . " The usher was bigger than me , but I was ready to fight him if I had to , the two of us duking it out in the aisle . But he made no move when my father shoved the manager , first with one hand and then much harder with both hands , knocking him on his can on the worn , red carpet . My father reached for the ticket stubs in his shirt pocket and threw them in the manager 's face and crouched down and whispered something I could n't hear , and then we left quickly through the EXIT door . I thought sure the cops would be waiting , but they were not . It was still partly light out , but the moon was up already and almost full , and my father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that box of popcorn , " he said , " and come on , " and he started to run , and by the time we got to the car he was out of breath , but he said , " Get on the floor in back and stay down . " Which I did until we hit Route 28 and he said , " It 's all clear , " and I climbed into the front seat . <p> It was dark now and the dash lights glowed green . My father pushed in the lighter and reached for his pack of Chesterfields between us on the seat . <p> " I wish I could undo a lot that I 've done in my life , " he said , " but I 've drifted too far downstream to paddle back now . " The lighter popped out and he lit his cigarette , and I stared straight ahead and imagined the car was a boat and that there were fish below us in the dark water where we 'd lower our lines or nets . Maybe there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women waving , the way my mother used to do from the porch each morning when my father drove off to work . He 'd reappear , what seemed like days later , his headlights on , and she 'd have a late supper ready for him , sometimes fresh walleye or perch or a batch of bluegill fillets that Paul Tremblay would drop off on his way home from the lake . Paul Tremblay always caught fish , and he said he 'd take me when I got older , but of course he never did , not once . We had never owned a boat , but here we were , driting at night , and my father said , " It 's easy , really , " and I asked , " What is ? " and he said , " This , just this , " and he motioned to the fields flooded with moonlight and to the moon itself and the stars which were very bright and then to the two of us , and he yawned because the days had already grown shorter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape of our lives , how we traveled from here to there , growing older , even during those few seconds it took us to cross Black Creek , which meant we were only a few minutes from home . And only one week until school started again , and maybe two months until the heavy snow , and I knew if my mother had n't come by then , I would n't see her until spring . Or never , depending on what the court decided . <p> " We made it , " my father said , same as he always did , turning into the driveway , and he hit the high beams and those red numbers seemed to waver back and forth like a buoy . He stopped and I got out to open the garage doors , and my knees were a little shaky , as though I 'd stepped ashore after being out all day on a rough lake . My father did not seem to notice . He walked right past me and up the stairs and yelled for me to close the garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against them , and I stayed like that , repeating the posture I 'd seen my father take that first night he realized for certain that my mother was gone for good . And then those numbers , as though we 'd had no real address all these years , no way for her to contact us if she changed her mind about Texas and whoever it was she was with there . <p> I wished Nelson Pelky had sent the lawyer 's letter back- " Insufficient Address " or " Undeliverable " or " Deceased , "  --  whatever lie was necessary to keep the mail away , so that I would n't have to hide it and get blamed when my father found out , which he would , and he 'd ask , " Why , why ? " and I 'd just shake my head like I did n't know what was wrong or right anymore , only that this was home , and I did n't want anyone , not even my mother , ruining that from somewhere else . Let her come here , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was exhausted from imagining what that was , and I closed my eyes and listened to the three Harry Bela-fonte albums my father stacked on the hi-fl . He must have thought I 'd gone to bed because he never called to me and when I went in after midnight , I could hear him snoring on the couch . I peeked in and he was asleep on his stomach , one hand almost touching the floor . I could see the orange of the alarm clock dial and the phone pulled up close . I knew , by morning , only the alarm would ring . He 'd hit the snooze , and then again , and then he 'd have to rush so 's not to be late for work . As soon as he left , I 'd take the receiver off the hook in case my mother called me . <p> And before Nelson Pelky arrived I 'd grab the .22 and hide in the cellar hole across the road . Not in ambush , exactly , but if he spotted me and started towards me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You stop right there , Mr. Pelky , " and I 'd click off the safety so he knew I meant business , so he knew I was nobody to mess with . He 'd probably call me my father 's boy . Grown-ups did , especially teachers , whenever I 'd fistfight at school . " That 's a fact , " I 'd say , " I am , " and I 'd tell my father , and he 'd say . " Let ' em make something of it . Let ' em say it to me . " <p> But the only one who ever did was my mother . She 'd say , " I suppose you want him to raise a hand to me , too ? " which I 'd never do , and my father had only done it the one time , which , like I said , had ruined everything . After that my mother seemed to dare him to do it again . She 'd lift her chin and step close and say mean stuff , but he 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it . He said to me once , " I wo n't forever , I wo n't , " but I knew he would . It was him who loved her , not the other way around . When I got older and got married my wife would have to love me back . That 's what I hated about my mother . Not that she ran off to Texas , but that she made it seem like my father 's fault . He was no angel , that 's for sure , but he could be awful kind . I 'd say that to the judge , too , if they really did subpoena my father , and I 'd say how he left me fresh cut slices of pumpernickle on the breadboard each morning so I could have toast with my cereal . But I figured that would n't matter to the law . They 'd talk on and on about how I had no friends and how I was always real quiet and shy and showed no emotion , like it was some crime to be alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father said about me to the counselor at school one day , " He do n't look punched or bored , now does he ? " And I never was bored , and I was never hit at home . I read a lot and stayed to myself , fishing and hunting and building forts . My father would say to the court , " Is there something wrong with that ? " He 'd say , " Goddamnit , answer me , " but nobody would , and I knew that 's what they 'd all want to see , my father 's sudden temper , so they 'd have grounds to snatch me as far away from him as they could . <p> That 's what Paul Tremblay told me one night when we were outside by ourselves . He said , " If you 're the man , then pool , in your face . In this state the woman reigns . " <p> So it was probably best the hearing went on without my father . He knew nothing about it and dropped me off at school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He small-talked about the weather and how we needed to put up another five cords of wood for the stove , and about how there was a good fight on TV that night  --  lightweights . " About your size , " he said , and flicked out a soft jab to my shoulder , and then another before he covered up , both arms hugging the steering wheel , forehead wedged between his fists . " Never make an easy target , " he said . " Give them as little as possible to hit . " But I knew he 'd left himself wide open this time , and that I was to blame . My mother and her lawyer would throw shot after shot , give him a real pounding . And the decision ? Custody of me , just like Paul Tremblay had predicted , to my mother . <p> All day in the back row I wondered if she 'd be there when I got home , waiting with the verdict . There was no car in the driveway , but I stood in the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school bus tires , and I could see Kevin St. Germain and Weasel Montjoy flipping me the bird out the back window . Usually I 'd yell something at those dopes , but not today . Today I nodded , like you win , you 're right . <p> My mother was seated at the kitchen table , her hands folded on top , folded like she 'd been praying or listening to someone talk at her for a long time . Her hair had grown past her shoulders and she was wearing a new dress , and lipstick , and from where I was standing I could see her feet under the table , her high heels . <p> " It 's just like your father not to show up , to tell his side , " she said . " It 's just like him . " Then she opened her pocketbook and pulled out a folded paper and asked , " Do you know what this is ? " <p> " Yes , " I said , " it says you can take me away . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the whole thing , me sitting here . There 's a limit , " she said , " and after that it 's all wrong , everything 's wrong , wrong . But I 'm never coming back here to live , and after the divorce is final , I 'll marry again , right away . " <p> And then she told me about Texas and about a man named Will Roop who she loved enough to be happy and who would adopt me and give me his name . She said I could meet him when he came to pick her up , but I said no . And I asked if he 'd been in this house , and she said , yes , in the kitchen , right here where your father hit me that time . And I wanted to hit her , too , just walk over and slap her good and tell her , get out , get out of here . But I just stood there and she said , " Those numbers ' on the garage , is that where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " 335 . It 's how you have to address everything now , or it does n't arrive . " <p> " All those years , " she said , " and I never even knew where I lived . On a county road in northern Michigan . " <p> " I want to stay here , " I said , and I paused , and I do n't know why , but I said to her , " They can see those numbers all the way to Lansing . " <p> " Yes , " she said , " you 're officially listed : you exist on the map . " Then she said , " Put down your books , " and I did . And she said , " Now come sit next to me , " and I crossed the kitchen and sat down and thought , when I looked at her close up , that if my father were to appear right now , my mother would stay forever . She would . But it was Will Roop who stood in the doorway , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing cowboy boots . I had n't heard the car pull in , but I could hear it idling now . " <p> " Will Roop , " my mother said , " this is my son , and he does not want to come with us . " <p> " Correction , " Will Roop said . " There 's nothing in those papers about ' want to . ' tie can want to or not when he 's eighteen . Or he can want to , but do n't you listen . Do n't give in , or you 'll never see him again . " <p> I gave Will Roop a hate stare , and he looked down at the floor , and my mother said to him , " I ' 11 be right out , " and he did n't argue . He turned and shut the door quietly , then the screen door behind him . <p> " Here 's my phone number , " she said , and wrote it on a napkin . " You call me . You call when you decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the way her lips opened and stayed that way a minute , that she was going to describe Texas , but she did n't . <p> " Okay , " I said , " I will , " and she did n't start crying when she hugged me , and without saying anything else she got up and left , quick as that . From the kitchen window I watched the car back onto the road , then drive down the wrong side to the mailbox . Will Roop reached into it and raised the metal flag and drove away . I knew my father would be home soon , but I waited a good fifteen minutes before going out there . <p> My father 's name was on the envelope , and under it , in red lipstick , 335 , and nothing else . I opened it and read the letter which asked my father not to contest the divorce , and if he needed to contact her it had to be through the courts . Never by phone , never face to face . She said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , and I knew that was a lie , which seemed okay in a way . And she said that she had never really loved my father , which I hoped was n't true . She was still angry , writing that letter right here on our kitchen table , probably . I figured the end of something like this needed an honest distance , areal stamp and postmark and return address , the kind of letter Nelson Pelky could deliver without risking a thing . I could smell the perfume in the lipstick when I crumpled the letter up and stuck it in my pocket . And I could see when my father 's car was in sight that he had Paul Tremblay with him , as he often did on Friday nights . <p> " You been with a lady , " Paul said , putting his arm around my shoulder . " Hey , Tommy , " he said , " your kid 's got himself a dame . " <p> " Probably Janice Knoble , " I said , " sometimes she stinks up the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're away from home , " Paul joked . " They leave their scent for you to remember them by , ai n't that right , Tommy ? " My father did n't answer , and Paul laughed again and reached for the football on the lawn and said , " Slant pattern , " and I cut just a few yards in front of him , and when I caught the wobbly pass he yelled , " Yes , yes , yes , " while my father walked away , not to check the mail , but to kind of stare off down the road . <p> " He 'll get over it , " Paul said , when I came back to hand him the ball , " and you will , too , " and I nodded to show I understood . And we both watched my father for a few seconds more before Paul barked out another play , and this time I ran the deep route , as fast and far from the two of them as I could . <p> <p> By JACK DRISCOLL <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
