Marie Wyman 's 87th birthday celebration at the Lobster Trap &; Steakhouse in Winslow , Maine , ended with a bang . As she backed out of a handicapped-parking spot , police say , Wyman lost control of her Buick and plowed right through the restaurant 's crowded dining room . Tables and chairs scattered as terrified diners scrambled for cover . Twenty-seven people were injured , and police say it was a miracle that no one was killed in the July 25 crash . Tragically , that was n't so in Los Angeles nine months ago , when Byron Cox , 96 , a driver with dementia , ran over Brandi Mitock , 15 , as she crossed the street . The teenager was killed instantly . <P> Spurred by Mitock 's death , State Representative Tom Hayden introduced a bill , now pending in the California legislature , that would make it tougher for drivers 75 and older to renew their license . The " Brandi Jo " bill is just one attempt to cope with a mounting public-health concern . Since 1987 , fatal crashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 4,928 in 1997 . In 20 years , the number of 70-plus drivers will have ballooned to 30 million , and highway-safety experts warn that the number of people killed in crashes involving elderly motorists is likely to surpass the drunk-driving death toll .

Attempts to identify unfit drivers , moreover , have been haphazard . Some states require frequent vision tests for elderly drivers .

With limited transportation alternatives , seniors who ca n't drive often become housebound and depressed . Last year , when Persis Thompkins , 80 , of West Palm Beach , Fla. , had a fender bender , she was terrified that she might lose her license . " I would have had to move into an independent-living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vans and private-car services . But city buses and taxis are often all there is . Losing a license is like a death sentence to most people . That 's why the adult children of elderly drivers will usually not intervene  --  even when Mom or Dad is a road menace . Members of one Detroit family tried to persuade the grandfather , 96 , to sell his Cadillac because he kept crashing into a tree next to the driveway . Instead he chopped down the offending object . <P> Some seniors , though , self-regulate . They do n't drive at night or on busy highways . " I know what hours to go out and get ahead of those young people , " says Mildred Mosely , 74 , a retired nurse from Oakland , Calif. , who cut back on her driving after cataract surgery . <P> Under the Brandi Jo law , all drivers 75 and older would have to take a vision test , as well as a written and road test every five years .
