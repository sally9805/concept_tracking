WHAT DID YOU think of the movie ? " Selma Wassermann asked her two grandsons as they left the theatre after seeing Home Alone II . " Good , " both boys agreed . Some grandmothers might have said , " Fine , hop in the car , " but Wassermann , a Simon Fraser University education professor , has written extensively on teaching thinking , and she wanted to probe a little deeper . I began to ask them other kinds of questions , " she says . " I began to talk about the violence in the film . Why is it OK to throw bricks at someone in a movie but not in real life ? What would it be like if those things really happened ? After about ten minutes one of my grandsons said , " Well , I think actually it 's not a good idea to have kids see all that violence . ' " Why not ? " I asked . He replied " Because it might give them ideas of things to do to other kids .

After 25 years of work in this area , she 's convinced that thinking skills  --  which include observing , comparing , predicting and decision making  --  can be improved through practice . Figure not transcribed It 's like learning to play the piano , " says Wassermann . " With practice , kids do in fact become much more thoughtful . There are ways parents and teachers can promote the ability to think rationally and wisely . We have to make it safe for a child to develop his own ideas . " While some adults may do this thought - promoting automatically , Wassermann feels , " We can all learn to do it better . " In workshops in the U.S. and Canada , education consultant Susan Close from British Columbia , helps teachers learn to foster children 's thinking . She promotes a number of " strategies " which can help learners of all ages improve the effectiveness of their thinking . Before reading a story together , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words from the book and ask them to predict what it will be about . As the story unfolds , children listen intently to find out how the author 's ideas match or differ from their own . In another strategy , children are asked to listen to a story and draw its main characters with cartoon - like speech and thought bubbles coming from their heads . Children who may have difficulty with regular , linear writing can often use such sketching techniques to develop and communicate their understanding of a story or situation . Before doing their own writing , children are encouraged to quickly jot down their thoughts in circles all over a page . " Clustering ' ' , or drawing lines between connected ideas , helps students organize their thinking . In " learning logs " kids as young as five and six reflect on the hows , whats , and whys of their learning . One student wrote , " When I am clustering , I notice that every thought leads to another thought . I think small , quick thoughts . " Says Close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superficial understanding with lots of regurgitation and not too much thinking . Now we look for a more complex understanding . We engage them deeply , have them do more reflection and self - assessment . " Can schools do all the work of teaching thinking ? Close does n't think so . " There is a movement towards more thoughtful interaction in schools , " she says . Nevertheless , she feels it 's crucial for parents and kids to spend time " making real decisions together and asking things like " how can we find that out ? ' ' " Dorothy Rich , author of MegaSkills , agrees . She writes , " There is a growing movement afoot to encourage more " thought - full " schools , but it will probably take more time than today 's students can wait for . What parents do n't have to wait for is the " thought - full " home . By this I mean a home where children get the practice they need in asking thought - provoking questions and in coming up with " thought - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do it now . " Rich stresses the importance of asking children open - ended questions and really listening to their answers . She suggests involving children in family decision making and asking them to imagine such things as what the world would be like if cars had n't been invented . " There are no right answers , " she says , " It 's a relaxed atmosphere of give and take . It 's a time for exchanging ideas , feelings , hopes , dreams . " Sharing ideas is rewarding for everyone . Says Selma Wassermann , " It 's so much fun ! Children are utterly delightful in what they come up with . " Susan Close adds , " I ca n't think of anything more important than talking with your child . Be with your kids and treat them like a gold mine , a precious resource . The payoff of thoughtful interaction is family time that supports life - long learning . " DRAWING AND THINKING A child 's knowledge of the world is reflected in his drawings , " says University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between kids ' art and thinking . She explains , " Sometimes drawing is the easiest way for a child to describe knowledge to another person or to keep track of a train of thought . In drawing , children can make more complex expressions than they can with words alone . " To encourage your child 's thinking/drawing , Kuiper has the following suggestions : Make sure your child has a place to draw , lots of paper , and a variety of pencils , crayons and felt pens . Engage your child in ongoing , casual discussions of her artwork . Ask her to tell you about her drawings and take the time to listen and respond . Show interest in the content of your child 's drawing rather than making a judgement on its quality . A thoughtful question like " what 's this squiggly line ? " or " how did you make that ice look so icy ? " is much more rewarding to a child than " that 's nice , dear . " BUILDING YOUR CHILD 'S THINKING SKILLS You do n't need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best opportunities for stretching your child 's thinking muscles may occur at home . Asking questions is n't enough  --  we have to be ready to listen thoughtfully to our children 's answers . Here are a few suggestions for building on your child 's natural ability to think . OBSERVING Help your child use all his senses . Talk together about the feel of a smooth stone , the smell of a bakery , street sounds on a rainy day and the colour of a bird 's tail . Later , share experiences around the dinner table or look up that bird in a guide - book . How well can you both recall your observations ? COMPARING Recognizing similarities and differences is one foundation of effective thinking . How many differences can your child describe between two stuffed toys ? A helicopter and an airplane ? A movie and the book it 's based on ? Make a game of telling " what 's the same ? " about odd combinations like a squirrel <p>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
