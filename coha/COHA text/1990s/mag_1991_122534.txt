The gentlemen 's quality program at Morse High in San Diego had never honored an athlete as its guest speaker in the program 's 13-year existence . So room 204 was buzzing on the morning of Jan. 30 , when Padres All-Star rightfielder Tony Gwynn , probably the most popular and successful player in San Diego sports history , walked in. // In his usual gregarious , disarming way , Gwynn spoke for half an hour to this group of 30 admiring young men . His message was : " Do what you want with your life ; it 's all up to you . " As Gwynn counseled , he smiled and laughed with his audience , until he began fielding questions . Suddenly the discussion turned to Gwynn 's career and where his own life was heading . The tone of Gwynn 's voice changed . He became edgy , defensive . // " I have a lot of time left , " he said . " I 'm going to do things a lot of people never thought I could do . That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you : ' He 's only a singles hitter , he does n't drive in runs , he does n't hit homers . ' Hey , they can say those things , but sooner or later I 'm going to do it . When I do , you 'll strip those labels off me and put on more . But I 'm doing what I want to do . I 'm playing the style of play I play best . Even though a lot of people might not like that , I 'm sorry , that 's just the way it is. " // Imagine that . A four-time National League batting champion , a lifetime .329 hitter , a six-time All-Star , a five-time Gold Glove winner , a Hall of Famer in the making , and he feels the need to justify himself and his career to a bunch of adoring teenagers . // The 1990 season did that to Tony Gwynn . The events of last year have made him guarded , gun-shy , distrustful  --  a sad transformation for one of baseball 's most good-natured people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a lesser degree , by the media , of being selfish , overweight , a whiner and one who indulges the press . In a team meeting in late May , Gwynn was trashed by some of his fellow players . Tension increased all summer , and in early September a plastic Tony Gwynn figurine was found mutilated and hanging in the Padres ' dugout . Gwynn 's season ended on Sept. 16 in Atlanta when he crashed into the outfield wall and fractured a finger . He refused to come to the ballpark for the rest of the season . His .309 average tied him for sixth in the league , but that was his lowest average in his seven full major league seasons . Wherever he turned , Gwynn heard rumblings that he 'd " lost something . " // " It was a long year for the team , " says San Diego pitcher Calvin Schiraldi , " and an unbelievably long year for Tony . " // And unbelievably unexpected . Gwynn , known as one of the game 's most dedicated players , seemed such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made him a media favorite . A leader in the community , he had always given generously of his time to helping kids . He was a hero in San Diego , and his life there had been a love affair . // That changed . The blasts from teammates stung Gwynn . " I saw him go into a shell , " says Fred Lynn , a Padres outfielder last year . Gwynn avoided the press from mid-September through December . " I always had to answer someone 's criticism , and I was tired of it , " he says . " Ask the guy who made the criticism , not me. " // Gwynn says he still loves San Diego and its fans and is excited about helping the Padres win in ' 91 . But he knows the new season docs not bring an entirely clean slate . " All that stuff from last year is still hanging over my head , " Gwynn says . " Somebody will always be judging everything I do , based on what these guys said . Even the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight years will judge me on what was said . It wo n't be any easier . I think it 's going to be tougher . It 's like I 'm branded . " // The Padres are certainly trying to make things easier for Gwynn . On Feb. 21 new general manager Joe McIlvaine signed him to a three-year , $12.25 million contract extension , which included a $1 million signing bonus . Says Gwynn . " I 'm very appreciative of that , but I also think I 'm deserving . It makes me feel good . " // Gwynn has to be equally happy with the fact that over the winter the Padres  --  who were last year 's preseason favorites to win the National League West but then finished fifth , with a 75-87 record  --  did a major housecleaning and in the process swept out Gwynn 's chief tormentors . Jack Clark , Gwynn 's harshest critic , was granted new-look free agency in December and was offered only a one-year contract by San Diego ; he opted for a three-year deal with the Boston Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free agent with the Minnesota Twins . Shortstop Garry Templeton , also in the anti-Gwynn camp last year , is tradable now that San Diego has shortstop Tony Fernandez , acquired from the Toronto Blue Jays in December . // The 30-year-old Gwynn arrived at the Padres ' camp in Yuma , Ariz. , last week , three days early and with a smile on his face . He bounced into the clubhouse , admired the Padres " new blue uniforms ( " I hated the old brown ones . I hated every one of them " ) , then spotted manager Greg Riddoch and immediately asked if he could get a coach to throw extra batting practice to him . // The aftereffects of last season could not be hidden entirely , though . During batting practice Gwynn dropped a bunt and said to himself , laughingly , " You selfish bastard . " // His mood was decidedly upbeat . " I ca n't remember being so determined to go out and do some things , " he says . " I 'm swinging the bat good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // The only direction Gwynn went last year was down . He admits he deserves some of the blame " because I got myself in a hole by the things I said , " especially his questioning of the Padres ' salary structure in December 1989 after he had dropped to being the team 's seventh-highest-paid player , at $1 million a year . // In the spring the hole became a chasm . On May 15 the New York Daily News quoted Pagliarulo as saying that one Padre was more concerned about getting his hits than about his team 's winning . Gwynn did n't pay the story much note until a San Diego writer told him that Pagliarulo was referring to Gwynn . ( Pagliarulo denies this , and has told Gwynn so . ) Gwynn reacted angrily , saying , " Nobody else is going to stand up for me , so I 've got to stand up for myself . " Before the Padres ' game on May 24 at Shea Stadium , Jack McKeon , San Diego 's manager at the time , called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was planned , " Gwynn says . " Jack McKeon said , ' Tempy Templeton has got something to say , ' then he and the coaches left . Tempy said there were some things in the paper that he did n't like , and he wanted to know where I was coming from . We started yelling back and forth . So Jack Clark is sitting there with a Coke in his hands . He slams it across the room , it breaks open and shoots all over the place , and he says , ' Hey , everyone in here knows why we 're having this meeting  --  because we got some selfish  --   --  in this room , and they 're pitcher Eric Show and Tony Gwynn . ' Eric was shocked . I was shocked . // " Now , Jack is an intimidating person . When he spoke , there was dead silence . Then Eric said , ' What are you talking about ? ' Jack laid into him . So I asked Jack , ' What the hell do you want me to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but he never answered me . Then I was criticized for not talking to the new players and telling them where to go , who to see , who to take their kids to , what restaurants to go to . Other guys chirped in , ' Yeah , yeah , you should have done that . ' Finally , I said , ' I quit . Go ahead and talk . ' // " After that meeting I was lost . I spent many nights asking myself , ' Is it me ? ' In other people 's minds , maybe they were right in thinking some things I did were selfish . But face it , this is a selfish game . You get up to the plate , there 's no one to help you but yourself . But I 've always tried to be a team player . As for the perception that I was sitting on my average by bunting one of the charges leveled by Clark , I just do n't believe you can sit on your average in May . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he changed his style : " I 'd go to the plate and say , ' Here 's a situation where I do n't pull the ball off this guy because he 's pitching me away , but if I bunt , I 'm selfish . ' So I 'd go up there and try to pull , forget about getting a hit , just try to pull . But that 's not what I do . I 'm a straightaway hitter . People should know if I say I ca n't do something , then I ca n't , and respect that . I do n't have to answer to anybody on my club who criticized me for my style . " // Just as Gwynn is still defensive 10 months after that meeting , Clark is still critical of Gwynn . " I wo n't miss being his teammate , " says Clark . " He is a good player , not a good teammate . " // Why not ? // " He has a losing attitude about baseball , " Clark says . " He protects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because everyone in San Diego kisses his ass . He 's , like , Mr. Padre . But you do n't know Tony until you play with him . He was n't playing winning baseball . If he 's as good a hitter as everyone makes him out to be , including himself , he should swing the bat instead of bunting with men in scoring position . But he was blind to that . He sees what helps his stats . No one bothers Tony Gwynn because he wins batting titles , but the Padres finish fourth or fifth every year . You figure it out . What 's more important ? " // As for his departure from San Diego , Clark says only , " If you step on Tony 's toes , you have no chance with the San Diego Padres. " // Says Gwynn , " I 'm just glad Jack ai n't here anymore , because it would have been a messy situation again . Who says so much credence should be put in what he says ? Because he 's a big , intimidating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he sure as hell has n't won any Gold Gloves . Maybe he should make a change . But he wo n't . And he 's going to Boston and will probably have his best year . He 'll be kicking back while we 'll be digging out of the hole that man dug here . " // This issue of " selfishness " in baseball is a thorny one . Gwynn joins a long list of standout players who have been accused of selfish play , including Wade Boggs , Pete Rose , even Ted Williams , the greatest hitter of all time . If a player 's main goal is to get 200 hits and he gets them , chances are he has helped his team , not hurt it . Gwynn did n't help his case by telling a friend in the dugout late last season , " Just 26 more , 26 more hits for 200 . " But do n't think for a minute that Gwynn is the only major leaguer who is keenly aware of his key stats. // If you talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged selfishness , the response is unanimous . Says McKeon , " He 's one of the most unselfish players I 've ever managed . In ' 89 , when he was going for a batting title , he was giving himself up to move runners along . " // Dick Williams , who managed Gwynn from 1982 through ' 85 , writes of Gwynn in his autobiography , No More Mr. Nice Guy : " I do n't think I 've ever had a player who worked harder , cared more and was more deserving of his awards . " // Riddoch , who replaced McKeon last July , says , " I saw Tony go outside the realm of his game last year to accommodate the feelings of others , and it took away from his ability to get 33 hits every 100 at bats . I told him , ' Just play like Tony Gwynn plays . You do n't have to live up to anyone 's expectations . ' " // Steve Boros , the San Diego skipper in 1986 , says , " Tony Gwynn could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stats consciousness is sometimes apparent , McKeon explains that " people misinterpret Tony . He 's very intense . He has a lot of pride . He might go 3 for 5 and be ticked off about making two outs . I 've seen him get three hits and go out after a game and hit some more in the cage . He 's a perfectionist. " // As for the complaint that he is too cozy with the press , Gwynn says , " After that meeting one of my teammates asked me , ' Why , if you go 0 for 4 , do writers come talk to you ? ' My answer was , ' I do n't know . ' I was perceived as being nice to the writers so they would do stuff for me . I do n't know . I ca n't control who comes to my locker . I talk to guys whether I go 0 for 4 or 4 for 4. " // He had more 0-for-4 's than 4-for-4 's last year . Some observers say his weight was the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 215 pounds , same as always . While 215 pounds on a 5 ' 10 " frame is probably too much , Gwynn has always been round , even when he was a point guard for four years at San Diego State . Says McKeon , " When he 's not hitting .350 , they say he looks heavy . I had the weight charts . I saw a difference of maybe two pounds from spring training until I left the field in July . But they said the same thing about me , too . I look a lot better out of uniform than I do in it . " // Like many people when it comes to their weight , Gwynn does n't want to talk about his . " My weight is my business , no one else 's , " he says . " As long as I do my job , no one says a word . If you think I 'm overweight , fine . If you think I 'm selfish , fine . All I say is let me do my job . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 72 RBIs. " // If few players readily quote such numbers , few would have to defend them , either . For Gwynn , however , those stats were substandard . And his stolen bases fell from 40 in 1989 to 17 . But if his weight was a factor , the extra poundage did n't prevent him from leading all National League rightfielders in putouts per nine innings and winning his fifth Gold Glove . // Despite last summer 's turmoil , Gwynn was shooting for his fifth 200-hit season . Then , in September , the Gwynn figurine was found hanging gruesomely in the San Diego dugout , the arms and legs cut off . The Padres held an investigation . Supposedly one of the groundskeepers at Jack Murphy Stadium hung the doll as a prank . // " There 's nothing wrong with having a good laugh , but when I saw it , I did n't laugh , " says Gwynn . A week later his season ended when he broke his finger . He cleared out his locker and went home . Asked by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Hell no , why would I want to hang around with those  --   --  ? " // He admits that that remark " blew it out of the water again . I should have been specific . I made a mistake . I 'm not perfect , although a lot of people seem to put me in that category . I 've made mistakes . My comment was out of character . But I felt I 'd been through enough . It was time to think about myself . They had been calling me selfish . It was time to be selfish . " // Now it is time to play baseball again . Gwynn thinks he 's ready . " I 'm a little wiser , smarter , more prepared for this year , " he says . " I 'm going to have fun . I did n't laugh as much last year . That was my fault too . This year I 'm going to have myself a good old time and play the game the way it was meant to played . If that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job to do . I can only do it the best way I know how . Someone will have something to say about me , I figure , about three weeks into spring training . But this year I 'm going to laugh . " // On the outside . Maybe .
