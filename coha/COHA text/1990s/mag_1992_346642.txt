The 106th Wimbledon tennis championships promised several Cinderella stories but delivered none . Old-timers Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe got as far as the semifinals , then were whipped . And Monica Seles , the steamrolling Serb with a shot at a Grand Slam sweep , got to the finals but lost in straight sets , 6-2 , 6-1 , to defending champion Steffi Graf . <P> But if there was no glass slipper for Seles , she was still the tourney 's top story . Late in her quarterfinal match , foes began charging that the formidable Seles ' most effective weapon is not her racquet but her racket : the unnerving grunts and shrieks with which she punctuates every stroke . Nathalie Tauziat of France and Navratilova complained that the screaming was so loud they could not hear the ball coming off Seles ' racquet . <P> The tabloids quickly dubbed her " Moan-ica " and demanded , " Stop that grunt ! " One writer , claiming to have monitored her with a " gruntometer , " said the noises coming out of the 18-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce . The grunts emitted by Gabriela Sabatini and Jennifer Capriati were deemed dulcet whimpers compared with Monica 's . Countered Seles : " I do n't think I 'm going to win a match because I 'm grunting . "
