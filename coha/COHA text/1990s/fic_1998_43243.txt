At first when the captain 's voice came on over the intercom and made the announcement , she felt almost glad . Not gleeful exactly , but a sudden ching ! of recognition coursed through her ; events fell into place . She was glad she 'd had her weekend at the hotel , glad for her swim in the hotel pool , for sleeping late , for the free hot coffee available in all the lobbies , tables laid out formally with linen napkins and china trimmed with gold leaf . She was glad , most of all , that she was flying alone ; her husband and children had n't come with her as they 'd threatened to at the last minute . She was glad to be so selfless knowing that they were safe on the ground . <p> The captain 's voice echoed her mood . It had a cheery lilt to it , like someone in a cartoon with a bubble over his head . It was his sightseeing voice he used as they passed over the runway then abruptly surged upward again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imply that this just might be a Christmas miracle , the kind in a made-for-TV movie about the yin and yang of selfsacrifice , as the engines churned forward , then picked up speed , the wings hovering and dipping like an uncertain insect . " Ah , well , folks , " the captain said , " it looks like we 've got a little problem here . Our landing gear light is shining red , and we do n't know what it means . That 's why we did that little dress rehearsal back there . " He paused to chuckle at his own wit for a minute , dryly , then turned sober and reassuring . He banked the plane again for emphasis . " Now do n't worry yet-it may not mean a thing . We 'll just fly around for a little bit and check out some systems . Try to be patient with us , if you please . " <p> Donna looked around to see what her reaction should be . No one else seemed to be panicked yet . An elderly couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grim little smile that said , " We go through this every day . " Other passengers , seasoned business travelers , were pretending to read their newspapers , thumbs paging casually , tenderly , through The Wall Street Journal . They were pretending to read computer printouts , legal briefs . Two seats up was a teenager who had n't even heard the announcement . He had his Walkman on , turned up high enough for Donna to hear the bristle of drums , the angry thud of voices protesting some teenage issue-bad drugs , bad sex at the multiplex , exams without curves . She wondered if she ought to tell him , tap him on the shoulder gently and mouth it , " Honey-could you turn that down a bit ? We 're going to crash . " ( Donna had called everyone under thirty " honey " since her children were born , as if she 'd suddenly and irrevocably catapulted into maturity , responsible for the frail moods of all souls . She practiced smiling when people were rude and ill-tempered , understanding for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the brick wall of mother love that would accept them ) . <p> The boy swung his head back and forth , " No . . . no no no no . . . " His smile was squeezed tight in a sullen orgasm of rebellion . " No . . . no no no no . . . " <p> No no no no ... , Donna mouthed to herself , but the captain interrupted , this time twinkling . " Yep ! Still here , folks . Now just sit tight . We have n't found anything specific yet , and things are stacked up over the airport , anyway , as per usual . So we 'll keep cruising . If you 'd like another beverage , our personnel will be coming through the cabin to serve you . " <p> At this cue the flight attendants broke their huddle at the cockpit . They clattered trays and carts , hoisted coffeepots , sprang soda tabs with a merry " Pffft ! , " jingled changed for beer and whiskey , all the while smiling as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office party . They moved quickly to fend off questions . They handed out extra bags of peanuts , as if this were one of the perks of crash landings . Their eyes were a geometry of evasion . <p> " And what would you like ? " The flight attendant smiled , acting her part flawlessly-grace under pressure . " Coffee or tea ? A beer , maybe ? We 're not charging for alcoholic beverages . " And though Donna wanted to ask her , What do you really know ? What did the captain tell you up there ? , she did not want to be the one to ask nor to undo the carefully composed mood of the cabin . " Diet Pepsi , " Donna said , " if you do n't mind . " <p> " No bother . " The flight attendant nodded gravely as if it were not only appropriate but wise to choose , as one 's last beverage on earth , something low-cal . Her gestures were a ballet of calm . " We 're here to make you as comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this one before . She 'd heard of captains like this . Their bravery put ordinary humans to shame . In times of catastrophe , they could sound like a training manual . They could go through all the niceties of protocol as if death did n't mean a thing . They followed their procedures . They enunciated their last words clearly into the black box . There was a captain like that a couple of years ago she 'd read about-somewhere over Iowa-who saved the lives of more than half the people on his plane by his expertise , his presence of mind . He was able to speak about the crash moments after the plane landed in a cornfield , able to explain how he 'd decided on that particular site based on wind velocity , angle of engine failure , forward thrust and momentum , air to ground time . The empty field was a miracle , though , the God-given aspect of the situation . It opened up like a mirage just in the nick of time . <p> Of course , Donna thought , everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open up there ? What interested Donna was how quickly the captain refocused the disaster into something positive . He did n't exactly gloss over the ninety-seven people who 'd been killed , but he made it seem as if they 'd beaten the odds , anyway . Two hundred and twelve people had been saved in a crash that might have killed everyone . He did n't bother to describe the burning bodies , entire families wiped out in one fell swoop . He did n't describe the particular horrors she 'd read about later , the passenger accounts . One woman in particular had written an article for a parents ' magazine , pleading with readers to pay for an extra seat on a plane trip to transport an infant in a carrier that could be secured with a seatbelt . Donna wondered if Captain Marvel had read that article , if he 'd read the mother 's description of her child 's trusting look as she tried to soothe him before they crashed . " I love you , " she murmured to him , her hand poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last fever . " I love you , little Bobby , little dear one . You 've had a beautiful life . " Then she kissed him over and over until the end . She was n't able to hold on to him when they struck the ground . He 'd hurtled forward through time and space , a frail illustration of the laws of physics , the rest of his life condensed to a few brief seconds of fear . Donna wondered how a mother could survive such a thing . <p> She was glad that she might not have to . That was one of her greatest fears , the possibility of outliving her children , imagining the hundred different ways she could lose them : fire , car crash , inhaled balloons , the impervious marble of bathtubs , the magnetism of empty electrical sockets . The thought of a knife too close to the edge of the kitchen counter sometimes made her gasp right out loud . <p> Now she might be spared all these-though there still were n't any clear signs of doom from the flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Christmas rush , balancing cups and trays , swinging sprays of tiny liquor bottles that chimed succinctly into the trash . <p> The plane itself seemed quiet as it plowed through the muffled darkness of clouds . The engines had smoothed to a hum , not loud and grinding like the plane she 'd taken on the trip out to St. Louis . That one had needed a tune-up , she 'd joked with a fellow passenger after landing , a man about ten years older than she . He had a tiny crease in his ear from a long-gone rhinestone , like a fossil imprint of his wild youth . She watched the discreet cascade of emotions that rippled across his face before he answered her : surprise , boredom , curiosity , lust , and , finally , lethargy . " Yeah . Well , that 's what you get for flying a bankrupt airline , " he said . He faced forward into the crowd of departing passengers and made his eyes glaze over . <p> She had n't meant to pick him up or anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her face pressed into the wool of someone 's back as everyone crowded to get off . A thought like that had n't occurred to her in years-she was a woman so thoroughly married , she 'd lost all gender . Though she did n't mean that with any special bitterness . It was just the inescapable result of being married , of being a mother , of parading nakedly through the streets with a double-stroller . <p> And since she thought of herself that way , as a bad mystery ( " The Case of the Revolting Mother " ) , it seemed ironic how this trip itself had come up . An old college friend had offered her a chance to be on a panel : " How Images of Women in the Helping Professions Have Changed Since the Feminist Movement of the ' 70 's : ' She did n't really qualify for the panel-she had no image . She 'd been a literacy volunteer before the children , had quit five years ago when Jackie was born , but she had n't ever been a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except maybe waiting . She 'd made a profession of that-waiting to grow up , waiting to leave home , waiting for her first love affair , her first husband , house , child . Her own mother had taught her to do this , had made her understand that happiness always seemed like a distant hill , just far enough away to look pleasant at twilight . <p> Like this trip . Something she 'd anticipated for months , since her third child , Michael , had been born . It was an anniversary present from Tom , but she 'd waited almost a whole year to do it , to be sure that as she walked out the door to the taxi , Michael 's cries would n't draw her back . They circled her , but she shrugged them off , shrugged off the rationale behind Tom 's gift-time to " rediscover " herself . His words . What could she find in a weekend ? What could possibly be left ? <p> She shivered now to think how eager she 'd been to leave home , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few short minutes-Tom 's offer , the conference , her reunion with her friend , the man on the plane who 'd snubbed her , the man at the conference who did n't . It had seemed like an opportunity at the time . Now it seemed like a mirage , a trap ; it was her fault because she 'd been so happy to leave her family . The plane was going to crash because of her , because she could n't stand how much her children needed her , how they screamed every time she left the room , even if it was just to get their pajamas from the linen closet . <p> When she 'd slammed the front door , departure day , it made an airtight seal . On her side , there was cool , clean air , trees as lighthearted as ghosts . On their side , sealed in amber , three despairing faces . Abandoned forever ? Time was like that for children . A few minutes seemed like a lifetime . <p> She wondered if they 'd gotten to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were already waiting , her babies with their noses pressed to the glass , caroling : Mommy ! Mommy ! Mommy ! They 'd be wearing their new snowsuits , their tender faces haloed in bunny fur . She wondered how long they 'd stand there watching for her plane before Tom dragged them away to check the board , what the word DELAYED would signify to them except that Mommy had n't kept her promise ; she was supposed to burst through that door right away like an angel and save them . Life for them was one rescue after another-from boredom , broken toys , premature bedtimes . <p> Someday they 'd be too old to want her , and that would be worse . They 'd be like that boy in the next row , oblivious , uncaring . His headphones were still on , and he was sound asleep , the static at the end of the tape whirred on and on , the mantra of all electrical equipment . Why did n't anyone wake him ? Even the flight attendant speeding by , the jolt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did n't rouse him . <p> The flight attendants were gathered again at the door to the cockpit , waiting for further instructions , whispering the way nurses do outside the door of a terminal patient . Predictably the captain 's voice reappeared again , not quite so cheery this time . It sounded strained , muffled , as if he 'd placed a handkerchief over his mouth to hide his true identity . <p> " Sorry to keep you waiting , " he sighed . " We 're still checking our systems and coming up blank here , so we 're going to try something a bit different . We 're going to come around again over the airport and buzz the tower . They 'll check us through their binoculars to see if our landing gear is intact . If it looks okay , we 'll make one more pass again then proceed with our landing . " The captain 's voice dwindled . Even now he was unwilling to say what they 'd do if their landing gear was n't intact . " Sorry to keep you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the red light meant-no landing gear . Donna felt a chill yawn open inside her , a mouth to a secret cave . She tried to remember any similar cases she 'd read of-a plane landing in that condition , what were their chances of surviving ? but all she could picture was an explosion , their plane , pregnant with passengers , bursting open , trailing fire as they skidded down the runway , plowing red searing scars into the tarmac . <p> Now everyone else seemed nervous , too . They tucked their heads down and checked their seatbelts . They stared out the darkening windows to grapple with fate , with clouds shifting form , disappearing into the night . Donna heard a rush of air that might have been the engines accelerating or the sudden whispering of everyone around her , lips forming wishful prayers . " I 've been in worse situations , " she heard someone say , but who ? Not the teenager . He was as still as the moon . Not the old couple across the aisle . They were holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rereading the provisions for sudden death . What sorts of allowances would be made in such a case ? Who would benefit ? <p> Only the businessmen three rows back seemed to still be taking this in stride , though at a slightly higher pitch . They shook their heads as if this were just another part of their job description . They were swigging beers , rattling bags of potato chips , their faces flushed with scorn for the other passengers . It was as if this were an office party they did n't want to break up , a Xerox of other near-tragedies that could be averted by a loud voice , a jovial attitude . They were laughing to keep the mood from changing , telling stories of near-misses they 'd had , crashes they 'd avoided by accidental rebookings , malfunctions that did n't pan out , emergency landings . <p> " I 've been on a lot of dud runs , " one of them said . " And I 've been drilled in shit , " said another , " and lived to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend across the aisle asked . " What the hell does that mean ? " <p> Who knew ? What did it matter ? <p> They rambled on rapturously as if these were war stories or tales of sexual conquest . There were mountainous fogs they 'd braved , shorn engines , battered wings , smokers in lavatories who set off alarms , were caught shamefaced with their pants down around their ankles stubbing out the evidence of their pleasure into their palms . There were baggage holds that split apart and cabins that lost pressure . There were drunken captains , incompetent ground crews who de-iced windows instead of wings . There was wind shear in their voices , tailspin in their eyes . <p> Of course all three of them had ordered several rounds of whiskey from the flight attendant on her last trip through . And then chasers . A few more chasers . All three wore London Fog raincoats buttoned and belted , ready to bolt when the plane came down . Their briefcases were poised across their laps , though the flight attendant chided them now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( When they landed . If they landed . ) <p> " Let 's not get too grammatical , " one of them said . <p> Which reminded his friend of another story which he told as soon as the flight attendant flickered back up the aisle . " I knew this guy once who boarded his live snake in the compartment in a lunchbox of all things . What an incredible jerk ! I told him not to do it , but he claimed he did n't want to freeze it in baggage-it was a tropical snake ! When we hit some turbulence , the compartment sprang open and out fell the snake-it had been crawling around in there loose the whole flight . A constrictor or something-long as my ass , long as a witch 's tit . " ( What is that expression ? ) " At any rate , all hell broke loose . Somebody yelled , Help ! Snakes ! Terrorists ! ' One lady peed her pants-I swear ! She wet the seat . You could see this big dark stain . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other two laughed uproariously , but Donna suddenly wanted to cry . What if they were really going to be killed ? What if the last thing she heard was some horrible stupid story ? What if she never saw her children again ? Or Tom ? She should concentrate on remembering them , press her feelings and memories into thumbprints , leaf stains . They probably had at least a half an hour left . Fifteen minutes , anyway , before they circled all the way over the airport and found their landing gear definitely gone . <p> Donna tried to picture them-Tom , with his arms around the children like a family portrait , grinning his gigantic smile , so sure that life was just right , that things would work out eventually if she would n't worry so much . Then she tried to review each of her children separately , their perfect limbs , their subterranean smiles , but they seemed to streak right past her without stopping , too small to be held . All she could clearly remember was the moment of their births , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain , their tiny heads pushing , pushing , pushing her aside . Those were the only real moments of her life , it seemed , for the last five years . If not forever . The three births . Jackie . Allen . Michael . One right after another . Her life with Tom was over as soon as her life with them began . It was horrible but true-why bother to disguise it now ? They both knew it , though they were too polite to say so . She would never think of Tom first ever again , would always feel that the best nights of her life were those first nights spent with each child , alone in the hospital room , their tiny lips pressed to her skin , soft as flowers ; all night their infant moans of pleasure as she nursed them . They were perfect children untouched by memory . Perfectly safe . Perfectly hers . <p> Donna wondered if the other passengers were having thoughts like this . Weird thoughts . Desperate thoughts . What exactly were you supposed to be thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt . Something that would change the course of your life forever , brief as that course might be . Dwelling on old sins , maybe . Or new ones . Maybe that 's why they were so quiet . <p> She certainly had enough to keep her busy for the rest of the trip . That man at the conference , for instance . As different from Tom as she could make him . A lot like the businessmen behind her . A complete stranger . Horrible to her in most ways , frightening , even , with his briefcase filled with monetary funds and annuities , his eyes set thirty years ahead on retirement , as if what happened in between was neither principle nor interest . <p> They 'd met at the pool , where she could see his skin stippled with scars , pockmarks , maybe . His white legs underwater thrashed as if there were a strong current . They grappled desperately with unseen forces . Donna had been a swimmer all her life and scorned people like this-hellbent on the rituals of exercise . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showered with gusto , strode to the edge of the pool , and peered down as if it were Niagara Falls . Then-plunge ! - dove in with such a splash , the waves knocked everyone else out of the water . It was people like this who broke their necks diving into the wrong end . That was their idea of real get up and go . <p> Predictably he surfaced heartily , thrusting up an array of water , gulping air . His backwash dislodged her goggles . " Nice dive , " she told him , and he was pleased . <p> " Thanks much ; " he said . His great round head nodded with slippery satisfaction . He was the least desirable man at the pool , so she chose him , to punish herself for what she was about to do . <p> " How about a drink ? " he asked her , waiting around and waiting around until she 'd showered and dried her hair . She did n't believe in saunas but lingered to try out the free soaps and lotions in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , a bathroom like that , with carpeting and silvery wallpaper , silk flowers nodding in crystal vases-a locker room decorated for an assignation . <p> Like the restaurant where they went to grab a bite beforehand . No time to waste . Part of the hotel 's package deal . Though it was only nine-thirty in the morning , the bar was already open and fluid with customers leaning over candles in red glass jars flickering knowledgeably , without warmth . Maybe it was the management 's idea of romantic , implying checkered Parisian tablecloths and tree-lined boulevards from some bygone era . That was the meaning of the red carpet , the crystal chandeliers and brass sconces , a timeless bar for timelessly tacky love . <p> She did n't mind that they went there . She wanted it to be tacky . And fruitless . She planned in advance that he 'd disgust her , to prove to herself , maybe , that touching someone other than Tom would make her sick . It was good that his arms were too thin , his chest was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these last hollowed-out years of her marriage , his lips would feel sticky , like pieces of a burst balloon . He would kiss her too long here . Not long enough there . He 'd hold her afterwards in a noncommittal way as if this were a demographic-the average length of post-coital grip . Wow ! Wow ! <p> That 's what he said at the end but in a voice that rang of sex manuals . Do this . Do that . Express urgency . <p> There was no real way to explain what she 'd done ( what excuse could she possibly give ? " At least I did n't have to pay for a babysitter " ? ) , and now , maybe no need . When she looked out the window again , they were lowering through the clouds , coming closer to the airport once more , waiting for their moment of truth . Donna recognized features of the landscape they 'd just passed a while ago , an hour ago maybe ? Who knew how long it was when your mind was wandering free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual grids of suburban neighborhoods just like hers : tree , lawn , house , tree lawn house , treelawnhouse-a series of what must be golf courses with tiny perfect ponds , miniscule flags waving , roads that looped around like elegant , handwritten O 's . They crossed the marshy discarded fields that surrounded the airport , the glowering highway filled with rush-hour cars staring up as the plane roared over with the unreal magnitude of a blimp . So close . Donna could feel the magnetic pull of the landing strip ( a battery of twirling lights from fire trucks already waiting for the crash ) , as they approached , the desire to kiss earth drew the plane downward , but they resisted ; the plane rumbled over the tower slower than gravity , then shot upward again , expelling a loud groan . <p> The engines demurred , showed fear for the first time . " Goddammit ; ' the captain muttered , " goddammit to hell , " then realized the intercom was on and revised himself , " Oops ! " as if this were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recast . His voice wavered up and down a notch , searching for the right key . He cleared his throat . " Well , folks . Ahem , " he said . ( A-hem . Two syllables . ) " I have some good news and some bad news . The bad news is-we 're missing something . Part of our landing gear must have fallen off somewhere along the way . Folks over Des Moines probably thought they saw Kahoutec . " He paused as if to let his audience recollect this forgotten comet of the seventies . A murmuring filled the plane , but not of recognition . " Also , the tower has figured out the runway here is too short for a gear-up landing , and we 've now burned up too much fuel to go to another airport . The good news is-there have been many successful landings over water . " <p> Water ? A water landing ? A shiver ran through them , a collective ripple of terror and reluctance . <p> The teenager two rows up screamed finally , but in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ karma had jumped ship and ignited him , made him dream his tapes were all snarled , unwinding for no reason into thin shining slivers that rustled onto the floor . Words tumbled from his mouth : Help ! Help ! I hate you ! like an echo to all their thoughts . <p> Even the businessmen seemed unnerved for the first time . Puzzled . Their deadlines were tangled . Their calendars were really bolloxed up . A checklist of disappointment welled up on their faces : Death . Water . Death . Water . Death . Jesus Christ-not Death ! <p> Death . <p> Clearly they were n't made for crash landings , though the flight attendant seemed to think so . She slid up the aisle smooth as glass to tap two of them on the shoulder , the two in the aisle seats , as soft and lightly as an angel , and pointed to the third in the window seat , her finger outstretched , serene , granting them pardon , or grace . <p> These men , her gesture seemed to say , were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These men were potential heroes-from where she stood , they were still neatly ironed . They could be guardians of the water slide , masters of the emergency chute and life rafts . The flight attendant warned them she 'd be back in just a minute to give them further instructions , but they could reread their passenger safety cards in the meantime . They could hold themselves steady . Keep their heads up and look chipper . Smile those brushed white smiles . <p> Her words were light and frothy , much lighter than the air holding the plane up , still heavy enough to lift all three of them partway out of their seats . They leaned forward in unified protest , their smiles frozen in overdrive . " God Almighty " one of them muttered-the snake charmer . He screwed up his lips as if to spit , but nothing came out , just words made plain and grammatical by fear , " God Almighty-did she really mean that ? " <p> " We 're going to be pretty busy up here for a while , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller , more manageable streams . " It 's going to take us some time to position ourselves , and the emergency ground crews are consulting with the Coast Guard about the best possible landing sites . " He made it sound so simple , like a car pool , but he was n't really fooling anyone . <p> All up and down the aisles there was motion , an animated universe of gestures like branches suddenly tossed by a hurricane , thrashing to get away , though the flight attendants warned them to stay in their seats with their belts fastened . The captain signed off again and left them alone without giving them any specific notion of time . Would he be back again ? Did " some time " mean five minutes or two hours ? <p> How much fuel did they have left ? Maybe they would just cruise around until everyone had made his separate peace with God . Well-why not ? She 'd once been in a plane with engine trouble over Peru . That was long before she 'd met Tom . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone with a sense of mystery , who believed in magic beads and the advice of tea leaves . She 'd gone to Peru on a whim to learn to " see , " a phrase she 'd borrowed from a popular mystic she barely understood . She 'd had a couple of ambiguous moments ( maybe spiritual , maybe not ) - chewing coca leaves with an Indian on the train to Machu Picchu , again at the peak of a volcanic mountain she 'd assumed was extinct until it rumbled . ( She had n't bothered to read her guidebook . ) <p> Then there was that real moment , the one she 'd thought was real , flying over the Andes , above a lake of clouds , when she was sure it was all over , felt the shining pinnacle of her body dissolving into the sun , had thought how light and casual it felt , like snow melting on a bright winter 's day , pleasant almost-the way she 'd repeated her own name out loud , several times , as if it might survive her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was on that plane , no one at all had the slightest idea where she was . Her entire history could be erased in a single minute , and there 'd be nothing left to remember her . She was twenty-five years old and had n't accomplished a single thing . <p> This time it was a completely different story . What would n't she leave behind ? Everything she 'd ever touched would become an artifact . Every word she 'd ever said to her children would be a mystery . <p> If they could even remember what she 'd said-words beyond " No , no , naughty ! , " words beyond " Do n't touch ! " Had she ever said anything meaningful , something they might remember as the years went by that would still glow for them like the birthday ring Tom had given her , a sapphire with rays of shifting light ? <p> She tried to think , but space seemed to be roaring around her , as if it were n't infinite and desperately wide but small and crushing , shutting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd had verbatim , with Jackie , her oldest boy-at Christmas , a year ago . They 'd been walking around the neighborhood together looking at displays of lights when suddenly a meteor had fallen , had moved across the sky slowly and deliberately as if pushed by an unseen hand . Donna had gasped and exclaimed , " I ca n't believe it ! I ca n't believe it ! We saw the Christmas star ! " Though Jackie had no idea what that was , he smiled for her , then exclaimed back , " That 's nice , Mommy ! " He still was young enough he 'd say anything to please her . She tried hard to explain to him the star meant they were lucky ; they were special . Maybe it meant they were blessed . <p> Now she saw it was just another crazy moment in a long line of them . It lifted her out of her skin for just a glimmer , and that was it . <p> All up and down the plane , they were remembering their own crazy moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra jackets , needle-pointed pillows that whiled away the time . They would n't while away the time now . Barely time to remember who they were , where they 'd been for the last twenty , thirty , sixty years . No way to define it except in glimmers , as she had done . <p> What were they thinking ? What last memories ? The old couple-were they remembering their grandchildren ? What medications they 'd forgotten to take that morning ? Were the businessmen thinking about statistics ? Or that special lunch at the Four Seasons , how lucky some of their clients were to eat caviar as casually as Spam ? <p> It was bad to be bitter in one 's last moments-that 's what Tom would say . But how would he ever know ? Nothing in the clouds to tell her what her attitude should be . They were a gray shroud , a thick , indecipherable tissue . They were still as an x-ray , silent as ice . As were her fellow passengers , riveted in their seats by expectation , facing straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one looked to see if there were life jackets underneath their seats ; no one felt to see if their seatbelts were properly fastened . No one looked to find the nearest emergency exit , as if , even at this late hour , that would be the grossest possible lapse in taste , to seem as if you were wondering how you could be the first person to leave the plane . <p> Not that Donna had ever been much for good taste . She did n't care much if her children were muddy , if they used their forks and spoons to eat . Tom blamed her for things like that , for socks that never matched , for the tone of voice she sometimes used to yell at the children , and him ( " I feel like a dog that just peed on the carpet- " ) ; sometimes she thought he blamed her for everything , right from the moment they met , years before , at a barbecue to celebrate the summer solstice . It was two months late because the hosts had been too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fault . The party was held at their farm , a never-saydie commune that had long since collapsed into private ownership . The members believed in total honesty , and that was how her friend had introduced her to Tom . " Now this is a woman worth sleeping with . " That was marriage brokering in those days . It did n't seem to deter him . They went off to pick buckets of blueberries that stained their hands and lips dark as ink , a tribal rite " We 're marked for life , " Tom had said . <p> This was clearly romantic , but later there was a pig roast , despite some vegetarians who objected , who took their tofu burgers and set up camp in another part of the field far away from where the pig smouldered in a deep pit plowed over with leaves and mud . Like a murder victim unearthed by accident . They dug the body up to eat it , subdivided the parts with a huge carving knife , waved forelegs , hindquarters . Donna and Tom sat next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . <p> Though not as weird as the little 8mm film of a home birth brought along by a newlywed couple to celebrate the first harvest and offered proudly as a follow-up to the dessert of blueberry pie and ice cream . What was it supposed to be ? Entertainment ? Erotica ? <p> That 's how Tom had labeled it afterwards- " porno lite , " though this really missed the essence . But so did the barbecue crowd , chanting : " New life ! New life ! Go ! Go ! Go ! " as the screening progressed . <p> Still , the couple was proud . Their timing could n't have been better . As luck would have it , the birth coincided with their wedding day-the film was still rolling from the ceremony when the bride felt the first contraction . She took off her wedding gown to labor right there in the field , got down on all fours to push the baby out into the billowing mess of her veil . Donna could n't believe how the woman 's haunches had clenched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer animal fury . There was no sound , thank God , to explain her wide open mouth , but Donna could feel the screams as if they were her own as the woman swayed from side to side , grinding her belly into the earth . <p> Donna and Tom left before the placenta came out , after the top of the baby 's head had popped in and out several times like a shy woodchuck peeping from its hole . That was one of the few times Tom was ever at a loss for words . Even at the birth of their own first child , he 'd been composed , had whispered something into her ear about launching a new ship . Back then , though , he 'd said , " Is it me , or is this the most disgusting thing you 've ever seen ? " <p> Back then Donna had agreed , but she did n't think so now . What could be more disgusting than dying before you were ready to ? <p> That 's what everyone else was thinking , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping up there . Donna leaned forward in her seat , ready to wake him , just as the flight attendant passed by , already in the act . She ran one bright red fingernail across his forehead , then shook him by the shoulder for good measure . " Wake up , sir , " she said firmly . " You ca n't sleep now . We need your attention . " <p> The boy opened his eyes and cursed . " What the hell ? " but she was already gliding away to another destination , another crisply performed task . " Damn , " the boy muttered again , as if she 'd interrupted something truly special-a memory of rollerblades or a bright green Mohawk , maybe the first time he told his parents to go screw themselves . <p> Nothing sentimental in his face . It was a map of pain and boredom-bored to be alive , bored in the U.S. of A. , bored by the sound of rain pattering along the drainage ditch in his suburban cul-de-sac . A boy with just one parent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , at any rate-all his exponents were mixed up . He was the kind of boy she was afraid her sons might grow up to be , the kind she always saw at shopping malls , too tall and skinny to be handsome , bent like a praying mantis over the record rack , worshipping the latest dance mixes , the type of boy who 'd sit on the floor of a coffeehouse in the dirt and cigarette butts , enthralled by the sound of the espresso machine ( hissing , hissing ... ) ; he probably liked to have his tongue vacuumed at the dentist , any sensation as long as it was unpleasant . A plane crash would n't bother him at all . He shrugged when the flight attendant warned him of what was to come . " Who cares ? " he asked with such bitterness it was almost touching . " We 're all gon na crash sooner or later . " Then , bolstered by his own wit , he readjusted his headset , tucked the spongy earpieces tenderly back into the hollows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , face tilted to his airjet as if it were glue . <p> They were handing out final instructions , holding up the laminated cards that looked so simple . There was the plane cruising midair . There was the plane nestled in the ocean , waves lapping gently . There were the merry passengers taking their turns obediently , zipping down the chute like a great water slide adventure . <p> " This is your flotation device , " the flight attendant said . She held up a seat cushion and waved it . " You 'll want to take this with you on your way out . After we 're safely in the water , you 'll need to dislodge it and take it with you down the emergency slide . Do n't take any belongings . You 'll want to get out as quickly as possible . This is the only thing you 'll need-it will help you to remain on the surface of the water while we wait for rescue . " <p> The flight attendant moved backwards several rows to give her spiel again . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam . ( She was really nervous after all , despite the look on her face of frozen glee . ) Her body trailed perfume-rose or lilac ? She moved forward in a cloud of goodwill and determination . " Now these gentlemen , " she said heartily when she reached the businessmen , " these fine gentlemen- " She waved her hand across them like a magic wand . " They 're going to help you , " she explained as she rotated a half-circle to face them . Her voice had a bright glare to it as she said , " You . You . You . " <p> She pointed to the one in the window seat . " You will open the emergency door when we land . And you , " she tapped the middle one with her long fingernail , " will help him place the door in the row behind you . Do n't throw it outside , or you might puncture the evacuation slide , which will deploy automatically . " She nodded to the snake charmer across the aisle . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the door yourself and deposit it in the next row . After you do that , jump down the slide . The three of you , do n't stay and try to assist people . You 'll only block the passage for the other passengers . " <p> She paused there , as if this were a moment in her script that deserved some thought . Donna marveled at her composure , the way her voice balanced on the ledge of a tall building . Her lipstick still gleamed thick as a layer of frosting . She could be dropped underwater , and she 'd keep right on ticking . Though none of them could . They 'd be at the bottom of the lake in just a few minutes , enshrined beneath the fierce upswellings of cold , of industrial waste , an occasional algal bloom . Their mouths would be clogged with ice , or fish , or stones . In summer the beer cans would rain down on their skulls , boats would roar across them , suntan lotion would seep towards them through the water slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , as if they 'd all just shared the same bizarre fantasy , but the flight attendant did n't miss a beat . She treated this silence as if it were a loud and drunken outburst , as if she were waiting for the man to say , " Hell , no , lady-I wo n't do that . You 're some crazy bitch if you think I 'll do thatcrazier than a witch 's tit ! " but he just shook his head-once , twice . His mouth was screwed up as if to spit , but nothing came out . <p> Donna felt sorry for the man . She nodded in sympathy like everyone else on the plane . Who was the flight attendant kidding ? Even assuming that a safe water landing was possible , gentle as Icarus tumbling into the sea . She thought of a father watching from shore , his son burning up like a meteor , then of Tom shielding the children 's eyes as the plane exploded . Luckily they 'd be too far away to see her . If they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far-off sparkler . <p> " This is a very important job , " the flight attendant tried again , as devoted to her job as a mother . " It entails a great deal of responsibility , " she added , as if this were something to add to a resume later : i ) Dispatched rescue equipment . 2 ) Saved face in plane crash . She bent towards the man to pat his shoulder , but he turned away and pressed his face to the window . This made the flight attendant nod once more , agreeably . " Okay , " she said . " That is perfectly all right . If you feel you are unable to perform your duties properly , then will you please change seats with someone who feels more confident ? Can I have a volunteer ? " She peered down the aisle expectantly , a glimmer of a smile on her face . Be brave , the smile said , be noble , be the kind of person you 've always wanted to be ! " We have n't much time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Donna saw the lake appear below them , waves as sharp as fingerprints , the tiny festive dots of boats crawling over the hard surface of the water . She knew just how hard it would be when they hit , like iron , like Tom 's face if she lived to tell him what she 'd done that weekend , how she 'd betrayed him as an experiment to see what it would feel like to do something absolutely wrong , to take on the shape of another life , a shadow that would glide between them , silent and dark , filling in the space her children had made that could n't be explained , not the moments of crisis , not the moments of ecstasy , but those absolutely plain moments that were sheer as ice-tucking them in at night , washing their hair , pulling up their pants , their little socks that fell around their tiny ankles , pouring corn flakes into their bowls each morning , tenderly , measuring their sleep in hours , weeks , sometimes in seconds , reading them the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chase his bouncy red ball . . . " ) , careful to vary the rhythms of her sentences , the pitch of her voice , patting a piece of bread with a smidgen of butter , a smidgen of jelly , smoothing her palm across each forehead as if she could instill something divine in them , make them healthy , better than she and Tom had ever been , better than they ever would be . " My children ! " she thought . " My little babies . " As if this were the most complete idea she 'd ever had , the most enlightened . <p> " Okay , " Donna said . " I 'll do it . I 'll do it . I 'm willing , " though the flight attendant did n't hear her . Everything was suddenly out of order , shaking to pieces as they went down , tipping over towards one wing , and then the other , unsure of gravity , where it might take them , the captain calling one last time over the intercom , " Hold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " the teenager in front wagging his head back and forth as if this were some far-out beautiful rhythm , plane crash as performance art . He was shaking his shoulders . He was beating the armrests with both hands . He was yelling , " Yes ! Yes ! Do it , Mama ! Do it to me , do it to me now ! " <p> " You be quiet , " the old lady across the aisle leaned over to glare at him . " Have some respect , young man , " as if they were in a church , a reverent movie theater , and suddenly Donna knew it was okay . His craziness would save them . This was his crash , not theirs ; he was the only one who believed in it . Everyone else still believed it could n't happen to them , not today , not with so much unfinished business , so much misunderstood , not with a husband and three babies waiting down below , their lives not yet unfolded , crushed up in cocoons of adoration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
