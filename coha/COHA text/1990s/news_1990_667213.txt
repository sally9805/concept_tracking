<p> MCA Inc. , owner of Universal Pictures , and Japan 's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. made it official with a handshake and a champagne toast Monday : Matsushita will buy MCA for $ 71 a share , or $ 6.6 billion . <p> The announcement capped two months of takeover talks between the companies . Matsushita ( mat-SOOSH-tuh ) , the world 's largest maker of TVs , VCRs , stereos and other consumer electronics , operates in 37 countries and produces Panasonic , JVC , Quasar and other brands . MCA , the USA 's fourth- largest entertainment company , is responsible for box-office hits such as E.T. , Jaws and Field of Dreams ; television shows ranging from Leave It to Beaver to Murder , She Wrote ; and record labels including MCA , Motown and Geffen . <p> The cash-and-stock deal is the largest Japanese takeover ever in the USA - exceeding Sony Corp . ' s $ 3.4 billion purchase of Columbia Pictures . The deal will give Japan control of 25% of the U.S. movie industry - a fact that has sparked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matsushita said it will leave day-to-day decision making in the hands of current management , which analysts say is the most logical thing to do . " You do n't fix what is n't broken , " says Jeffrey Logsdon , analyst at Seidler Amdec . There were similar fears about Columbia Pictures , but Japanese ownership has n't changed much there . The studio has released hits such as Postcards from the Edge since it was acquired by Sony . <p> In fact , Matsushita 's purchase of MCA is viewed widely as an effort to maintain the long-term rivalry between the two Japanese electronics powers . The battle has gone on for years as a David-and-Goliath match . <p> Daring , innovative Sony played David - often beating Matsushita and others to market with new technology such as the Walkman and the home VCR . But gigantic , conservative Matsushita often used its financial muscle and manufacturing expertise to catch or surpass Sony once Sony established the market . That was the case in the pair 's biggest battle . Sony pioneered the VCR market with its Beta format @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually crushed Sony 's effort . <p> Sony 's takeovers of Columbia and CBS Records two years before changed the battlefield . Besides electronic hardware , Sony produces the software - movies , shows , music - to play on the boxes it makes . MCA brings that element to Matsushita in perhaps an even better way because MCA provides records and films in one long-integrated firm . <p> The software acquisitions also are ammunition in the war that is developing over high-definition TV . HDTV promises TV pictures as crisp and clear as a photograph . Several competing technologies are being developed . Sony and Matsushita each has its own version , and some experts see a repeat of the VCR war . <p> The reason control of TV-show and movie production is so much more important in the HDTV war is that for HDTV to work best , TV shows must be shot with video cameras compatible with the technology used by broadcasters and in TV sets . And made-for-TV movies must be shot on theater-quality film . When Beta and VHS were slugging it out , moviemakers released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow that . So control of programming gives the hardware maker greater leverage to persuade the world to use its technology - in the same way RCA sold color TVs in the 1960s by having its NBC unit broadcast lots of color shows . <p> If Matsushita 's deal to buy MCA marks a chapter in its struggle with Sony , it also marks the end of an era for the legendary Hollywood power . Launched in 1924 in Chicago as a booking agency for bands , Music Corporation of America jumped to representing Hollywood talent in the 1930s . It counted Henry Fonda , Greta Garbo , Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan among its clients . <p> In 1946 , founder Jules Stein handed the reins to Lew Wasserman , a 33-year- old movie usher-turned-movie agent who would prove to be one of Hollywood 's top empire builders . In 1952 , Wasserman began producing TV shows . MCA bought a Universal Studios film lot in a 1959 expansion and took over Universal two years later , absorbing its parent , Decca Records . Universal 's first release under Wasserman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered a candidate for takeover since Wasserman began having health problems five years ago . Periodically through the late ' 80s , rumors would fly that Wasserman was back in the hospital and MCA stock would jump a few points . Wasserman , 77 , will reap $ 327 million worth of preferred Matsushita shares for his MCA stock . <p> Beyond the inescapable changing of the guard , MCA had many reasons for running into Matsushita 's arms . For one , MCA has had to face the fact that the entertainment industry has turned into a global business , and to keep pace , MCA would have to expand its international focus . <p> " The game has changed , " says analyst Christopher Dixon of Kidder , Peabody &; Co . " Competing on the global level requires an alliance with someone with the global penetration of Matsushita . " Matsushita also comes with deep pockets to fund MCA 's film and music ventures . Matsushita , whose American depository receipts rose 2 1/4 to $ 128 3/4 on news of the deal Monday , had more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Though rumors had pegged the price tag for MCA as high as $ 90 a share during the negotiations , analysts say the final deal was a fair one in view of current conditions in the stock market and the demise of junk bonds , which fueled the takeover boom of the 1980s . There was no bidding war for MCA - something that would have been unheard-of just two years ago . Companies such as Walt Disney , Time Warner and GE had been rumored to be potential suitors for MCA . But in the end , it was just MCA and Matsushita working out a deal . " You reach a point where you get the highest figure you 're going to obtain , " Wasserman said Monday , confirming rumors that the talks nearly collapsed last week . <p> MCA 's largest shareholder , record mogul David Geffen , was pleased : " It 's a great deal . If it were not for this deal , MCA stock would be selling for $ 38 a share . " <p> The actual terms of the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $ 5 a share worth of stock in a television station that MCA will spin off . Federal law prohibits foreign ownership of TV stations . Matsushita plans to sell MCA 's Yosemite &; Curry , which provides concessions in Yosemite National Park . Wasserman and MCA President Sidney Sheinberg have signed contracts to continue in their roles . <p> There was little Japan bashing in Hollywood circles . " I do n't think Hollywood 's creative community will be responding to Japanese input on an artistic level , " says Martin Grove , business analyst for The Hollywood Reporter . " It 's possible you 'll see some self-censorship . ... ( But ) Matsushita , like anyone else , is going to want to see ( MCA ) do as well as it can , and that means making movies that work at the box office .
