Even now , I ca n't bring myself to blame my parents . They had their reasons ; they carried scars from their own childhoods . My father 's father was a manic-depressive , his mood swings legendary , the household perpetually caught between the thunder of his passions and the gray spaces of his despair . My father , when he married , longed for a house filled with music and a little girl 's laughter ; and naturally he wanted to ensure that his daughter did n't inherit her grandfather 's affliction . Back in the eighties , when my father was growing up , they had n't yet mapped the gene that causes bipolar disorder , much less figured out how to mask it ; if only it had stopped at that . My mother , for her part , had had an idyllic childhood , perhaps too much so : something of a musical prodigy , she had spent fifteen happy years in violin recitals , only to discover that youthful virtuosity does n't necessarily mature into adult genius . Having bitterly learned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her daughter would know no limits . <p> And so I was conceived  --  an appropriate term , I think , since I ( and thousands like me ) began more as a concept than a person , a set of parameters later realized in flesh . We were an affluent family with a home in Reston , a tony suburb in northern Virginia , but even for an affluent couple gene enhancement is not a cheap proposition , and I was to have no brothers or sisters . But my parents got their money 's worth . By the age of four  --  as soon as I had the necessary hand strength for the piano  --  I was picking out complex melodies I 'd heard on the radio . I had , have , an eidetic memory , and as soon as I learned to read music , I discovered I could sight-read virtually anything that was put in front of me  --  taking in a page at a glance , then playing it effortlessly . Eighty percent of so-called musical genius is just this facility to sight-read , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , luck played no part in it . <p> The other twenty percent is technique , and I had that as well . By the age of seven I was playing Bach , the piece he 'd written for his own daughter , the Anna Magdalena Notebook ; by eight , his Two-Part Inventions ; by nine , I had mastered the more challenging parts of Bartok 's Mikrokosmos . I kept a busy schedule : music lessons twice a week , two hours of practice each day , the occasional student recital , a normal load of schoolwork . But I enjoyed it , I truly did . I loved music ; loved making music . Of course it 's true that I was quite literally born to love it , shaped not just genetically but by early exposure to music , the " hard wiring " of my sensory cortex that locked in my musical skills ; at times I wonder if my passion is less real for that , but the sweet melancholy that grips me as I play the Adagio from Marcello 's Concerto in D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Image , these are real emotions , regardless of whether genetic conduits were laid to channel them . <p> Who knows ? Perhaps even the degree of my obsession with music was predetermined , manipulated . That might explain my single-minded attention to it in my earliest years when I most needed such single-mindedness ) , forsaking the company of other children my age ; I was almost twelve before I had the first hint of something missing from my life , and by then it was a little late to acquire the social skills others had learned as a matter of course . I had a few acquaintances at school , I was no pariah , but playmates ? Not really . Confidants. ? Hardly . At three o'clock each afternoon , as my classmates scattered to local playgrounds or shopping mails , I was somehow left behind , like a stone in the heart of a leaf storm , too heavy to take flight . I wandered home to practice , or speed-read novels in the woods near Lake Audubon , taking in pages as though I were drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was reading about than my lungs understood the oxygen they took in . <p> On one such afternoon , autumn light waning around me , I lay on my stomach on a fan of oak leaves , reading a book and listening to Rachmaninoff on my laser chip , when I heard a boy 's voice behind me say , " Hi . " <p> Startled , I sat up and turned around . There was a boy , about my age , sitting up against the thick trunk of a maple tree , big floppy sketch pad  --  orange cover , cream-colored pages  --  propped up on his knees . Like me , he had fair skin and dark hair , but he was about half a head taller than I. There was something vaguely familiar about him ; I wondered if I had n't seen him in school . <p> " Hi , " I said . I had n't heard him approach , and I was sure he had n't been sitting there when I lay down , ten minutes before . But I was so pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me  --  that I did n't give it a further thought . <p> He smiled , a friendly enough smile . " My name 's Robert . " <p> I might have been lonely , but I was still shy ; I took a cautious step toward him . " I 'm Katherine . Kathy . " <p> " You live around here ? " <p> I nodded . " On Howland Drive . " <p> " Yeah ? " His eyes brightened . " Me too . " <p> So that was it . I must have seen him on our street . Feeling a Little less reticent , I nodded toward his sketch pad . " Can I see ? " <p> " Sure . " He angled the pad so I could get a better look , as I sat down beside him . The top page was a lovely pencil sketch of the surrounding woods , exhibiting ( I can say today ) a very sophisticated understanding of perspective , light , shadow . <p> But being twelve years old and knowing nothing of any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> That was enough . He beamed . " Thanks , " he said . He flipped through the book , showing me other sketches , some still-lifes , a few portraits , all of them excellent . <p> " Do you go to school for this ? " I asked . <p> " I take lessons . " <p> " Me too . " I added , " Piano . " <p> " Yeah ? Cool . " <p> He flipped to a portrait of a girl with blonde hair and big eyes , and I let out a little yelp of recognition . " Cindy Lennox ! " I cried out . " You know Cindy , too ? " <p> " Yeah , sure , I go to school with her . " <p> He flipped past Cindy 's portrait to a fresh piece of paper , began absently sketching as he talked . " I 'm getting a paint-box for Christmas , " he announced , " half the size of this pad , with its own hard drive , oil and watercolor templates ... man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's incredible ! " <p> Not to be outdone , I said , " I 'm getting a new orchestral sequencing program for my MusicMaster . I 'll be able to add up to fifteen different voices  --  strings , horns , keyboard  --  " <p> He looked up from his sketch and smiled , as though something had just occurred to him . " You 're one too , are n't you ? " he said . <p> " One what ? " <p> His smile took on a secret edge . " You know . When the doctors do something to you , before you 're even born ? " <p> Suddenly I felt afraid . I knew exactly what he meant , of course ; it was all over the media , there was even a website about it on the Schoolnet . Some parents even took their kids on TV and talked about it ; but most , like mine , kept quiet , fearing that their children would be discriminated against , excluded from scholastic or talent competition ( though this was technically illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , but had sworn to my parents I 'd never talk to anyone about it . So reflexively I shot back , " Not me . " <p> " Yeah , sure . " He sounded unconvinced , and I must admit , the idea of actually meeting someone else like myself thrilled as well as frightened me . <p> So without admitting anything about myself , I said , " So you 're one ? " <p> He nodded , switching pencil colors , continuing to sketch . " My folks 'd kill me if they heard , but I do n't care . I 'm not ashamed of it . " He looked up ; gave me a little smile . " Are you ? " <p> This was getting dangerous . I stood up quickly . " I  --  I 've got ta go . " <p> " Do n't you want to see your picture ? " <p> " My what ? " <p> He turned the pad around , showing me its face : my face . A rough outline , without much detail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a really good likeness . My dark hair , cut in a short pageboy ; my lips , which always seemed to me too thin , pursed in a shy little half-smile ; my eyes , the irises a light blue , so light my father once told me he could see the sky in them ... <p> " That 's really good , " I said , impressed . " Can I  --  " <p> I looked up at him ... and my breath caught in my chest . <p> " What is it ? " he said , sensing my distress . I did n't answer . I was looking in his eyes  --  the irises a light blue ; very light . He said something else , and I did n't really hear it ; I was watching his lips as he spoke ... <p> " Kathy ? " I finally heard him say . " What is it , what 's wrong ? " <p> " Nothing , " I lied . But inside I felt strange , as though I had discovered something I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding nightcrawlers underneath . Something similar squirmed inside me when I looked at Robert . I told him I had to go home and practice my piano he seemed disappointed , started to get up , but I was well on my way before he could suggest walking back together . <p> Later , playing alone on the swing set in my backyard , I realized I had turned my back on someone who might 've become my first real friend , and the rush of the wind blew my tears back into my eyes , and I thought I would drown in my own regret . <p> I did n't dare tell my parents about Robert , of course  --  I was afraid they would n't believe that I had n't actually told him anything about myself . I kept a cautious eye out for him at school , but never caught so much as a glimpse of him , which I thought strange , considering the size of the school . Finally , consumed by equal parts anxiety and need , I went up to Cindy Lennox one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of yours the other day . He said his name was Robert . " <p> She looked blank . " Who ? " <p> " Well I do n't know his last name , but he did a sketch of you . He 's an artist ? " <p> She just shook her head . " I do n't know any artists named Robert . " <p> I felt like an idiot . I stammered out something , guess I 'm mistaken sorry bye , and quickly got out of there . I resolved to forget about Robert entirely ; he gave me the creeps , why did I even care who he was ? <p> I went home , my mother took me to my Thursday session with my piano instructor , Professor Laangan , and I gladly lost myself in Chopin and Bach for the next hour . When I got home I banged out of the house , into the backyard , intending to play on the swing set until dinnertime  --  <p> But there was someone already on the swing . <p> Not Robert ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ; all I saw was a dark brown ponytail bobbing behind her as she swung . <p> On my swing . In my backyard ! <p> " Excuse me ? " I said . That startled her . She jumped off ; turned around to face me , hands indignantly on hips . <p> " What are you doing in my yard ? " she demanded . <p> As before , I could n't answer . I was so stunned , I could n't even speak . I was staring ... at myself . <p> Me but not-me : her hair longer , ponytail arcing like a whip behind her , and though her features were identical to mine , I was seeing them configured in a way I never had before  --  thin lips twisted in a sneer , sky-blue eyes flashing with annoyance , head cocked at a haughty little angle . " Well ? " she said petulantly . <p> Finally I found my voice , even if it did crack a little : " This  --  this is my yard . " <p> She took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a certain swagger in her walk . " Oh , is it now ? " <p> I stepped back , a reflex . She smiled , sensing that she had the advantage . " Look , " she said slowly , " you 're obviously not very bright , so it really would n't be fair of me , with a 200 I.Q. , to take advantage , but ... oh , what the heck . This is your yard , so , ipso facto , you must be ... Katherine Brannon ? " <p> I could n't stop staring at her . It was like looking into a mirror , but having your reflection suddenly start mouthing off at you . I was silent long enough that she said , " Hello ? Can you at least pretend to some intelligence ? . Especially if you 're trying to impersonate the winner of the Fairfax County Scholastic  --  " <p> I did n't care what she 'd won ; I 'd had enough of this little brat . " I live here ! " I shouted suddenly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care who you think you are , this is my house ! " <p> Those crystal blue eyes , my eyes , were transparent with hatred . " We 'll just see about that , " she said coldly , then turned on her heel  --  and ran toward the house . I 'd left the back door open ; she ran through it and out of sight . I raced in after her , through the kitchen and into the living room , where my father was just sitting down to watch the news . <p> " Where is she ? " I yelled , breathless . He blinked . <p> " Where is who ? And why are you yelling , young lady ? " <p> " The girl ! The one who ran in ! The one with  --  " I almost said , The one with my face , but wisely did n't ' take it that far . <p> " The only girl running in here , " my mother said , coming up behind me , " is you . " <p> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even the kitchen again ; the girl was gone . Shaken , pressed by my parents for answers , I told them I was just pretending ; made it seem as though I were chasing an imaginary playmate . And as I lay in bed that night , I almost convinced myself of the same thing ; that my imagination  --  and loneliness  --  had conjured up my strange nemesis . I went to school resolved to try and overcome my shyness , to make more friends somehow  --  to find the time , between lessons and practice , to do the normal things other girls did . <p> In the cafeteria at lunchtime , I noticed a new girl with long , silky blonde hair sitting alone at a table , eating her macaroni and cheese . Screwing up my nerve , I marched right over and introduced myself . <p> " Hi , " I said . " You 're new , are n't you ? " <p> The girl shook aside her long shock of hair , looked up , and smiled at me . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just transferred over from public . " <p> And once again , I was looking into my own eyes . <p> Involuntarily I cried out , a yelp of shock and fear . This instantly made me the focus of all attention in the cafeteria , which distracted me just long enough to look away from the blonde girl , the blonde me , for a moment ... and when I looked back , she was gone . <p> I spent the rest of the lunch hour feeling the eyes of my classmates on me , like sunlight focused through a magnifying glass ; their whispers , their little sniggers , were even worse , each a tiny dagger in my back . When the bell rang , I greeted it as a deliverance ; but what it delivered me into turned out to be far worse . <p> During math period a male version of me  --  not Robert but another boy with my eyes , lips , nose  --  looked up periodically from his desk , rattled off the solution to an equation as though he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an electronic notepad . No one else seemed to notice him , and I kept silent , biting my lip , my hands trembling the whole hour . <p> In English I glanced up from my own notescreen to find the blonde Kathy ( she signed it Kathi ) standing before the class , reciting an essay - even as my teacher , Mrs. McKinnon , simultaneously lectured us on the proper use of participles . I sat there , the two voices clashing in my head  --  trying to drown them out with my thoughts , a memory of the bombastic third movement of Hindemith 's Mathis der Maler  --  praying for the blonde me to shut up and sit down ... <p> In gym class a taller , lither version of myself straddled the parallel bars like a budding Olympian gymnast ; she swung her perfectly proportioned legs up , up , up , balanced herself for several moments in a perfect handstand , then swung down and vaulted off the bars . And watching her amazing balance , her strength , her grace , I felt the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... <p> By the end of the day , as I hurried out of the building , they were everywhere : the bratty Katherine ( Katja , she called herself ) was holding court by the stairwell , her mocking laugh at someone 's expense echoing through the corridor ; in the music room one version of me played the violin , as another practiced the flute ; in shop class Robert was making a wooden horse from soft balsa , touching the edge of its mane to a spinning lathe . <p> I hurried home , but to my horror they were all following me , a procession of Katherines , male and female , tall and short , dark and blonde and everything in between  --  all laughing or talking , bouncing balls or hefting schoolbooks , a phantom regiment haunting my every step . I ran the last several blocks , ran into the imagined safety of my home , crying " Mommy ! Daddy ! " but this was no refuge either : as I burst into the living room I heard a voice , my voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano , practicing the scales with a perfect pitch I did n't possess ; saw too a red-haired Kathy with sculpted nose , green eyes , and full lips , talking endlessly on the phone ; saw a tomboy Kathy bang in in torn jeans and T-shirt , yelling for Mom  --  <p> It took me a moment to realize that I was screaming Shut up ! Shut up ! SHUT UP ! at the top of my voice , shouting Mommy ! Daddy ! Make them go AWAY , and as I fell sobbing to the floor I saw my mother , her face ashen , stumbling as she rushed toward me  --  and then she was holding me , rocking me , and for one terrible moment I was n't even sure , I did n't know , which one of us she really held ... <p> The hospital came as a relief . I did n't know why at the time , but the number of other Katherines dwindled from dozens to a handful , and the more radically different ones  --  boys ; blondes ; gymnasts  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear ( and that was the correct word : as I lay in bed , staring into space , I saw them walk into the room as through a fold in the air , then exit , minutes or hours later , in the same way ) all looked pretty much like me , and all looked just about as screwed up , as well . One sat in a corner and cried for what seemed hours on end ; one angrily pounded her fists on the door and screamed obscenities ; another tore a small piece of loose metal from the bed frame , entered the toilet , and never came out  --  I stayed out of the bathroom for hours , my bladder bursting , terrified at what I might find in there . <p> Seeing these terrible alternatives , ironically enough , was the best thing for me : determined not to end up like any of them , I did n't let my fear turn to panic , or hysteria . I stayed calm when the doctors asked me questions , I told them everything I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , oddly enough , condescendingly . Almost all doctors treat children as though they 're not merely young but retarded as well ; yet here were a bunch of adults soberly asking me questions as if I too were an adult : " What were the differences , physically , between the boy you met in the woods and the boy in math class ? " " Did all of the other Katherines call themselves that , or did they use other names ? " <p> Their matter-of-factness helped to keep me calm ; even encouraged me , when they asked if I was seeing anyone at the moment , to shrug and say , " Oh , sure . There 's one sitting in the comer right now . " And I 'd swear I saw one of them glance , ever so slightly , into the comer of the room , then quickly back again . <p> Each of my parents blamed the other for what had happened : my father accused my mother of working me into a state of nervous exhaustion , and my mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her side of the family . I heard all this late one night when they thought I was asleep ; heard also my father 's wounded silence , pregnant with guilt and fear that perhaps his father 's legacy had n't been extinguished , after all . <p> But as it turned out there was more than enough guilt to pass around . When the doctors finished their examination and sat down to talk to my parents ( though I did n't learn this until years later ) their first question was , " Is she gene-enhanced ? " Apparently this sort of " psychotic break , " as they called it , was not uncommon among the genetically enhanced - one in every ten children suffered under some similar kind of delusional system , the onset usually just before puberty . They did n't know why ; all they could do was study the pathology and hope to understand it . The good news was , most children , with therapy , could learn to distinguish between reality and delusion . Would my parents agree to place me in outpatient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course they agreed . The choices they 'd made for me , for my life , now came back to haunt them ; and where once they had dreamed for me a life far above normal , now they prayed it would be merely , blessedly , normal . <p> My favorite of the doctors was Dr. Carroll , a prematurely gray woman in her late thirties ; she came after the first round of interrogators , and immediately endeared herself to me by bringing me a set of flowered barrettes for my hair . " They 're my daughter 's , " she said , " but I thought you might appreciate them more , just now , and she was happy to let you have them . " I was wearing drab green hospital gowns most of the time ; the pink and purple barrettes were a welcome reminder of the outside world , and I beamed as I slipped them into my hair . <p> " Thanks , " I said , adding , " How old is your daughter ? " <p> " A little older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my reflection in the small vanity mirror and smiled . " You look very pretty . " <p> I automatically shook my head . " Not me . I 'm not pretty . " <p> " I think you are . Why do n't you ? " <p> Dr. Carroll 's talent for making therapy seem like gentle conversation put me at my ease , and her calm attitude toward my starkest fears made those fears seem somehow surmountable . At first we talked only about music , and school , and all the normal self-image problems any girl my age would have ; it was n't until our fifth session together that she asked me if I saw any other Katherines in the room just then . <p> I glanced over at the window , where the Screamer , as I called her , was pounding on the thick leaded glass , shouting " Fuck ! Fuck ! Fuck ! " over and over . I told this to Dr. Carroll ( though I did n't repeat the F-word ) , wondering if she believed me . <p> She nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very seriously and said , " You 're a very special young lady , Katherine . You know all about that , do n't you ? " <p> I hesitated , not admitting anything , but she went on as though I had : <p> " Well , sometimes special people see special things . Things other people do n't see . That does n't mean those things are n't real . It does n't mean that you 're wrong , or crazy , for seeing them . " <p> It was the first time anyone had used the word crazy to my face , though not the first time it had occurred to me . Tears sprang to my eyes . " I 'm not ? " I said in a small , unbearably hopeful voice . <p> She shook her head . " I ca n't tell you these things you see will ever go away . But I can help you to live with them . " <p> " But who are they ? " I asked , desperate for answers . " Where do they come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure yet . We have some ideas , but we ca n't talk about them to your parents because that 's all they are right now , just ideas . But ... " She put a fingertip , lightly , to my lips ; smiled . " Can you keep a secret , Kathy ? Our secret , yours and mine . Not for your mom or dad , or your best friend , or anyone ? " <p> I nodded eagerly . <p> " You 're a little too young to understand it all , " she said , " but think of them as ... echoes . Like when you call out in the woods , and hear your own voice bounce back at you ? That 's all they are . And they ca n't hurt you . " <p> " Are they real ? " <p> " Not in the way you are , " she said . " How can I  --  ? " She stopped , thought a moment , then smiled . " Hold out your left hand , " she instructed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , " she said . " Now . Look around . Do you see any other echoes ? " <p> I looked around the room . The Screamer was still there , of course , and the sobbing girl , and ... <p> I gasped . <p> Sitting next to me on the bed was another echo  --  a perfect echo , in fact , dressed just like me , the flowered barrettes in exactly the same places , identical in appearance , except ... she was holding out her right hand . <p> " What do you see ? " the doctor asked . I told her . When I turned back , the echo was gone . <p> And I began to understand , however vaguely , what the echoes truly were ... <p> I went home about two weeks later , and though the number of echoes increased when I did , they no longer terrified me the way they had ; with Dr. Carroll 's help  --  mainly concentration techniques  --  I was able to reduce them to the level of background noise , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things about them : how some echoes-looked as real , as three-dimensional as I did ; how others seemed curiously flat , like watercolors painted on the air ; how still others were vague , hazily defined , flickering in and out of existence as though their purchase on reality was tenuous at best . As the years passed and my vocabulary increased , my ability to describe what I saw increased with it  --  and I dutifully reported everything to Dr. Carroll . <p> I returned to school , but found that my absence had only made things worse for me there ; word had gotten out that I 'd checked into a hospital , and though " nervous exhaustion " may be relatively value-neutral for adults , for children it is one more way to set someone apart . My classmates  --  some of them  --  would call out to me in the hallway , " Hey , Nervous ! " Or , " Hey , Nervie ! " If I objected , got angry , they just made a bigger deal of it : " Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to the bughouse ! " All I could do was ignore them as best I could ; if I could ignore the echoes , I told myself , I could ignore anything . <p> But even the classmates who did n't actively torment me shied away from me , and my loneliness went from tolerable to profound . I did n't mention it to my parents on the reasonable and usually accurate assumption that parents only made things like this worse ; I stuck it out until I moved on into high school , where I thought I could melt unobtrusively into a larger student body , and where  --  amid the normal quotient of violence , drugs , and gangs  --  I hoped a week in a mental hospital was hardly worth mentioning . But there were still those who remembered , still those who took delight in harassing me ; my only solace was my music , and my only friend , Doctor Carroll . <p> Most if not all of my echoes made the transition to high school with me ; but the majority , luckily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked , talked , laughed , and moved like images on a movie screen that just happened to be the world . A few , like Robert , continued to interact with me occasionally . Sometimes they would try to do this in the middle of a class , and I had to do my best to not react , to keep my expression stony . They never seemed to appear during my piano lessons with Professor Laangan , and I finally realized why : there was only one piano in my instructor 's home , and while I was sitting at it , I could n't see any of the echoes who were doubtless occupying that same space . On occasion , however , I heard snatches of melody , other hands fingering other keys in some other reality : some not as well as I , some just as well , and some , to my great annoyance , better than I. <p> On rare occasions , an echo found me alone , as on one overcast day in March , as I walked home from school to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . <p> " Hi , " he said . I looked around . There was no one else on the street ; it did n't much matter if I answered him or not . Perhaps it was a mark of my loneliness that I wanted to answer him . <p> " Hi , " I said . Like me , Robert was entering puberty , but unlike me , it seemed to agree with him . I was a slow starter , short and flat where my classmates were growing taller and rounder . Robert was going through a normal growth spurt , filling out , becoming more muscular ; his voice was deeper too . More and more I felt uncomfortable around him , uncomfortable with the feelings he evoked in me . But I tried to be friendly ; I smiled . <p> " See you got that paint-box for Christmas , " I said . <p> " Yeah , it 's great . You get that sequencing program you wanted ? " <p> It had been so long I 'd almost forgotten . I nodded . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quietly , " I wish we could be together . " <p> I felt suddenly anxious . " I ... do n't think that 's possible , " I said , picking up my pace just a little . <p> He thought a moment , then nodded sadly . " Yeah . I guess not , " he said . Then he shrugged . <p> Something occurred to me , then . " Do you ... see them ? " I asked . " The others ? " <p> He looked at me with puzzlement . " ' Others ' ? " <p> No ; clearly , he did n't . " Never mind , " I said . " Well . See you . " <p> I started to veer off the path we 'd been sharing  --  but he reached out , as though to take my hand ! I 'm sure he could n't , not really , but I never found out ; I flinched , pulled back my hand before he made  --  or did n't make  --  contact . <p> He looked hurt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his eyes , his tone , disturbed me . Suddenly this felt wrong ; unnatural . <p> " I  --  I 'm sorry , " I said , turning . I hurried off down the street ; he did n't follow , but stood staring after me for what seemed the longest time . I kept walking , head down , and when I finally looked back , he was no longer there , as though the wind itself had taken him . <p> " Why can they see me , but not each other ? " <p> By now most of my sessions with Doctor Carroll resembled physics lessons more than psychotherapy ; we would sit in her office and discuss all the books she 'd given me , the ones comprehensible to a teenager , and she could now give more sophisticated answers to my questions than she could a few years ago . <p> " Because you 're the observer , " she explained . " They 're just ... probability wave functions . You 're real ; they just have the potential to be real . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually , some of them can see each other  --  the ones in your hospital room , the ones who ' split off ' from you fairly recently . " <p> " Robert seems awfully real for someone who is n't . " <p> She got up , poured . herself a cup of coffee . " Well , some of the echoes had more potential to be real than others . Obviously , at some point your parents seriously considered having a boy , as well as genetically enhancing his artistic skills . The more chance that that ' you ' might actually have been born , the more real their echo seems to you . " <p> I shook my head . " I 've read all this stuff , " I said , " and it seems to me like everybody should have these echoes . " <p> " We probably do , " she allowed . " For all we know everyone on Earth may be a nexus of an infinite number of probability lines , with the more likely waves creating artifacts  --  echoes .

" <p> " So why can I see mine , but you ca n't see yours ? " <p> She sat down at her desk again and sighed . <p> " Sometimes , " she said with a smile , " I think we have as many theories as you have echoes . Kohler draws an interesting analogy . Zygotes grow by cellular proliferation  --  one cell becoming two , two becoming four  --  and differentiation , that is , some cells become muscle , some nerve , et cetera . Probability waves , the theory goes , proliferate in much the same way  --  one wave splitting in two , the second differentiating from the first on a quantum level , creating various quantum ' ghosts . ' Perhaps you remember the quantum split in the same way the body remembers things on a cellular level . Perhaps the process of enhancement creates some structural change in the brain that enables you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , " I said , " you do n't know . " <p> She shrugged . " We know more than we did when you first came here , but that 's only been a few years . Chances are it will be another generation before we have enough  --  forgive me  --  enough autopsies to collect a decent amount of data . " <p> I envisioned my body lying inert on a laboratory table , my skull split open like a coconut , scientists studying the ridges of my brain like tea readers . The image stayed with me for days . Sometimes the worst part of my " ability " was that it reminded me too clearly , too consistently , of my origins . My musical talent was all I had , I clung to it desperately , but at times I had to wonder how special , how real , was a talent that had been so carefully graphed , mapped , plotted . I tried not to dwell on it , but it was hard not to ; hard to fight off the depressions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the worst times . <p> In March of my senior year my parents , Professor Laangan , and I took the train to New York City , where I auditioned for the Juilliard School . My audition pieces , I had decided , would be Chopin 's Etude in E major , a prelude and fugue from Bach 's Well-Tempered Clavier , Elliott Carter 's Piano Sonata , and my longtime favorite , Alessandro Marcello 's Concerto in D minor . The Marcello , originally written for oboe and orchestra , I would play in a reduction for piano , but I needed someone to perform the orchestral part of the score ( Juilliard had only recently allowed the use of concerti at auditions , but still did n't permit computerized accompaniment ) , and Professor Laangan had graciously agreed to do so at a second piano . As the train hurried closer to New York I felt thrilled , energized , terrified  --  all normal things to be feeling , to be sure . But as I walked into the classroom and faced the panel of three Juilliard instructors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were all looking at me as though they knew , as though I bore some stigmata instantly identifying me as a fraud , a genetic cheat ( though I told myself that I could hardly be unique in that , here at Juilliard ) . At the piano I hesitated a long moment , trying to stave off my self-consciousness and fear , unable to look the faculty panel in the eye ... until Professor Laangan prompted me by clearing his throat , and , unable to put it off any longer , I took a deep breath and launched into the Etude . As soon as I began playing , thank God , my fears vanished . I was no longer a gene freak , I was no longer even Kathy Brannon , I was the instrument of this music , the medium through which it came to life two centuries after it was written , and that was enough . <p> After Chopin came Bach , and after Bach , the complex counterpoint of Carter 's Sonata ; and then Professor Laangan took his place at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had played the others well enough , I knew , but this piece was different ; this I felt deeply , and as I played , I understood for the first time why it held such special attraction for me . As I played the first movement , the Andante with its sweep and eloquence , its sometimes breathless pace , it seemed to represent all the promise and impatience of youth  --  my promise , the promise that my parents had instilled in me . I segued into the second movement , that sense of bright expectation replaced by the slow , haunting strains of the Adagio , at once lyrical and sad  --  mirroring the turns my own life had taken , the shifting harmonies sounding to me like the raised voices of ghosts , of echoes . And finally the third movement , the Presto , returning to the faster pace of the first  --  lighter of heart , a structure to it that seemed to promise a calmer , more ordered existence . No wonder I loved it ; I was living it . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read their expressions , but I did n't care  --  I knew I had done well , that I had exhibited both technique and feeling , and , more importantly , that I had done the best I was capable of . My parents , the professor , and I celebrated with an early dinner at Tavern on the Green , then took the 7:00 train back to Washington ; and as the train cleaved the darkness around us , I felt as happy , as secure , as I had ever felt . <p> The feeling , of course , did not last long . I returned to school the next day , where I was judged  --  where I judged myself  --  on a different standard . Ever the outsider , I would walk alone from class to class , but all around me  --  in the halls , on the grounds , in the cafeteria  --  my echoes walked and talked and laughed with unseen others : friends I could not see , friends I would never know . Blonde Kathi was now a cheerleader , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of well-wishers ; I watched her flirt with unseen admirers and I wondered how she found the courage , I longed to do the same . Another echo , a flautist , walked by in her band uniform , nodding and talking to other ( invisible ) band members , and I coveted that uniform , the solidarity it represented ; there was no place for a pianist in a high school band , and no time for me to learn another instrument . Even bratty , bitchy Katja seemed to have friends , God knew how ; what was so wrong with me ? <p> At night , as I lay in bed , it became harder and harder to ignore the echoes swarming in the darkness . The red-haired Kathy with perfect , genetically sculptured features undressed by my wardrobe closet , casting no reflection in the mirrored door , but I saw every perfect curve of her body outlined in the moonlight : full breasts where mine had barely budded , baby fat long gone , wavy hair cascading down her back . I looked away . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot of my bed ; she moved with grace and assurance , with a serene confidence in her body and herself that I lacked , that I envied . Glancing away , I caught a flickering glimpse of a male echo  --  not Robert or the mathematician but another boy , a football player I think  --  taking off his clothes . His image was vague and tenuous  --  a more remote potential for existence , I suppose  --  but I could still make out his wide shoulders , his muscled torso , thick penis hanging like a rope between his legs , and in a way I envied him too  --  his apparent strength , his male power . Sometimes it felt as though I lacked any power over my life , and he  --  and the gymnast , and the redhead  --  seemed to have so much strength , so much confidence . It was n't fair . Any of them could have been me , I could have been them , it was n't fair . <p> Dr. Carroll tried to convince me that I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't hold yourself up , she said , to every infinite possibility , every unrealized ambition . I knew she was right , but I was feeling particularly insecure ; it had been weeks since my audition in New York , and still no word from Juilliard . I told her I was afraid I might not get in , she assured me I would ... and then , after a moment 's hesitation , she added , " And even if you do n't , there are other ways you can use your gifts . " <p> I nodded ; sighed . " I know . There are plenty of colleges with fine music departments around , but Juilliard  --  " <p> " I did n't mean your music , " she said . " I meant your other gift . " <p> I blinked , not understanding at first ; I hardly thought of it as a gift . " What do you mean ? " I asked , a bit warily . <p> She shrugged . " You have a unique skill , Kathy . You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , with the same ability , who 've put that talent to work . " <p> I had no idea what she was talking about . <p> " In research , " she explained . " Think about it . In medical research , for instance , certain decisions are made in the course of an experiment ; combinations of chemicals , of drugs , chains of combinations . Sometimes you work months , years , only to find out it 's a dead end . <p> " But someone like you  --  simply by becoming part of the experiment  --  can change all that . You make one decision , one we may even know the outcome of in advance  --  and a whole spectrum of potential outcomes is created , echoes , some of which you may be able to communicate with . You could save weeks or months or years of precious work time , hasten the invention of cures , speed up the pace of science a hundredfold . People 's lives might be saved who would otherwise die waiting for drugs to be developed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch . I looked at her ; my face must have been ashen . I thought of the flowered barrettes she had given me , and knew I would never be able to look at them again in the same way . <p> I stood up , feeling lost , feeling sick . " I have to go . " <p> Realizing she 'd overplayed her hand , Doctor Carroll stood as well . " Kathy  --  " <p> " I have to go . " And I fairly well ran to the door , not listening to her frantic calls , and I never went back . <p> That night , the sobbing echo appeared again , crying herself to sleep in a comer of my bed ; I lay in the dark , ear plugs a poor insulation from her cries , wanting desperately to take up her lament , to join her in her sad chorus , knowing I could not ; I must not . As terrible as that night was , I told myself that the Adagio had to end sometime ... did n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Juilliard . I was ecstatic at the thought . Not just the opportunity to study at the world 's most renowned college for the performing arts , but the chance to start fresh in a new city , a new school , where no one knew me and no one would ever call me " Nervie " again . Mother and Father went to New York with me to find me a place to live , no dorm rooms being available in Rose Hall ; they were sad to see me leave Virginia , but jubilant that I had ( they believed ) overcome my " problems " and was " fulfilling my potential " - and their expectations . <p> After a week of apartment-hunting we finally found a small , unremarkable one-bedroom on West 117th Street , near Columbia University . Once , it had probably been a nice enough neighborhood ; now it was somewhere between a funky off-campus environment and a war zone , with gangs , drugs , and streetwalkers a stone 's throw from my building . My parents were quietly horrified , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors and scabrous walls , I felt almost delirious with joy : because the flat truly was empty , empty of echoes , of ghosts : for the first time in five years , I was alone . Over my parents ' reservations I signed a one-year lease , went back to Virginia to pack and ship my belongings , and by summer 's end was living in New York , truly " on my own " in a way my family could never comprehend . By moving here , I 'd diverged from the paths the echoes were taking ; this apartment , this life , was mine , and I had to share it with no one else . Oh , to be sure , once or twice I caught a glimpse of some small echo , a left turn instead of a fight , a blue dress instead of a white one  --  but they disappeared quickly , like ripples on water ; the worst of them , the Kathis and Katjas and Roberts , I had left well behind me . I rented a small piano , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , and began my new life . <p> In addition to classes in piano , I took courses in sight-singing and music theory ( first semester , harmony ; second , counterpoint ) , and it was in the latter class that I made my first real friend . His name was Gerald : warm eyes , a slightly sardonic smile , blond hair already receding a bit above a high forehead . A violinist , in his second year at Juilliard , I gathered he had already made something of a splash here ; we got to talking , he invited me out for coffee after class . <p> It was evident , just in the way his eyes tracked men more than women as we walked across campus to a coffee shop on 65th Street , that Gerald was gay , and to be honest I was relieved ; I had no experience at dating , and the concept was both exciting and daunting . Over coffee , Gerald said he 'd like to hear me play , so we found an empty practice room in Rose Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my audition . <p> He seemed impressed . " How long have you been playing ? " he asked . <p> " Since I was four . " <p> He raised an eyebrow . " And I thought I was a prodigy . My parents started me on a half-size violin when I was five . " He smiled , then said , " Why do n't we try something together ? " <p> We did  --  that day and every day for the next week . I was the stodgy traditionalist , Gerald the pop culture maven ; in addition to classical pieces we collaborated on Gershwin , Copland , and a lovely violin certo by the 20th century motion picture composer Miklos Rozsa . Gerald sight-read as quickly as I did , and for a while we tried to one-up each other with increasingly difficult pieces on a cold reading . Gerald did n't bat an eye  --  which started me wondering about him . I watched him more and more closely as he played  --  noticing that every once in a while he seemed ... distracted ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just beyond his sight . It took me weeks to work up the courage to say something , but finally , over coffee one evening , the cafe we sat in nearly deserted , I found the nerve : <p> " Gerald ? " My voice was soft , and it trembled a little . " Have you ... I mean , do you ever ... hear . Things ? " <p> He looked at me , bemusedly . " Do I  --  hear ? Things ? " <p> I flushed with embarrassment . " Never mind . Forget I said  --  " <p> Quickly , he put a hand on mine . " No . It 's all right . I ... think I know what you mean . " <p> My eyes widened . " You do ? " <p> He nodded . As it turned out , I was right : Gerald and I had more in common than we first realized . Like me , he was gene enhanced  --  but unlike me , he had only partial vision when it came to echoes . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red stop light , " he said , " and then you look away , and you see , just for a moment , a spot of green , because green is red 's complementary color ? That 's what it 's like for me . Complements , I call them ; opposites . I only see them for a moment , and then they 're gone . " <p> " Lucky you , " I said . <p> " Actually , I do feel lucky , at times . One of the first ' complements ' I ever saw was a ' me ' who was  --  do n't ask me how I could tell this ; I just did  --  a me who was straight . Not macho , just ... hetero . I saw him look at something , and somehow I knew he was looking at a woman , and I just knew . <p> " And I realized , all at once , how fortunate I was . Because the doctors , they 've known for years which genes incline us one way or the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn out ... and my parents did n't ' correct ' it , as they could have ; as so many parents do these days . And I just felt very fortunate , that my parents  --  even if they did want a violinist - loved me enough to let me , in this one way at least , be myself . " <p> I smiled , a bit wistfully , but before I could say anything Gerald suddenly leaned in : " Listen , " and I could feel him changing the subject , perhaps uncomfortable with all this , " do you know Bach 's Musical Offering ? " <p> " Of course . " <p> " I 'm performing it in recital later this semester . " His eyes were bright as he said it . " Me , another violinist , a cellist , a flautist , and a pianist . How 'd you like to audition for it ? " <p> If I was disappointed that Gerald was only partly a kindred spirit , I quickly got over it ; I was thrilled at the prospect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the next several days being coached by Gerald ; at the audition I competed with several other piano students , all of them quite gifted , but I felt no trepidation or fear : it was refreshing , exhilarating , to be competing with someone other than myself . With Gerald accompanying me on violin , I performed the sonata that was part of the Offering - and was stunned and delighted when , the next day , Gerald called to tell me I had , in his words , " gotten the gig " ! " Now , of course , " he said , deadpan , " we beat you senseless with practice for the next six weeks . " I laughed . The only happier moment in my life was the day I was actually accepted to Juilliard . <p> A week later , another first : Chris , a cute dark-eyed boy in my sight-singing class , actually asked me out on a date . I was eighteen years old , ashamed to admit that I had never been on one before , trying to act casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . " As soon as I got home I called Gerald and asked his advice . " Be yourself , " he counseled , " and try not to bump into the furniture . " I liked Gerald , but as a confidant he left something to be desired . <p> Chris took me to the campus Drama Theater , where students from the drama department were staging Edward Albee 's A Delicate Balance . Chris put a hand gently on my arm as we made our way to our seats ; I sat there , excited not just by his presence but by how very normal it all felt  --  by the prospect that perhaps , after all , I would have a normal life , filled with normal joys and only normal pains . I barely paid attention to the play , and it was n't until almost the end of the first act  --  at the entrance of " Harry and Edna , " the older couple so shaken with existential fear that they take refuge in their best friends ' home  --  that I sat up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , timid , fearful  --  and I gasped . <p> Edna was me . <p> Or at least one of them was . The actress portraying Edna in my world , the real world , was a short blonde ; but in some other near-reality , I was playing the part . This echo was slightly taller than me , her hair somewhat lighter , and her form was translucent , shimmery , in the way I associated with the more remote echoes  --  separated from me by hundreds if not thousands of other potentialities . <p> I heard the two actresses ' voices transposed on one another , even their bodies occasionally superimposed , and I fought to keep calm when I really wanted to wail with grief , to mourn the loss of my newfound individuality : I 'd thought I was alone , thought I had something to call my own , and now  --  <p> Tears welled in my eyes and I turned away , terrified to let Chris see . I fell back on old concentration techniques , trying not to watch the echo on stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , and at intermission I ducked into the ladies ' room to compose myself . Hands gripping the sink , I told myself I could not , would not , cry . Steeling myself for the rest of the play , I went back inside the auditorium with Chris ... but it was even worse than I thought . When the curtain rose on Act Two , it came up on the character of Julia , the daughter ... and that , too , was me . <p> A different me ; short , plump , familiar features set in a round face , chubby arms waving angrily , in character . Oh , Jesus , I thought ; oh , God , no . I managed to keep my despair from showing throughout all of that first scene , but when " Edna " appeared in the middle of the next one  --  when I saw two echoes of myself strutting about the stage , four different voices playing as though in quadraphonic stereo  --  my agitation started to show . Chris could n't help but notice ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the show , and in my discomfort I must have appeared distant and unfriendly , because he took me home , bussed me on the cheek , and never called again . <p> As I fell asleep that night , the sobbing echo returned for the first time in months , sitting in a corner of my previously untainted apartment  --  and , from that point on , never left ... <p> I should have known ; should have realized that my parents ' ambitions for me would be so alike in so many other potential realities . In the weeks to come a day did not go by that I did not see at least one echo : Passing a dance class I caught a glimpse of a graceful , poised Katherine ( Katrina , the instructor called her ) at the ballet barre , dark hair in a chic chignon , long legs pirouetting flawlessly to Saran Lake , her face almost regal in its serenity . In my sight-singing class I heard my own voice drowned out by another , familiar in some ways but with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I saw her out of the corner of my eye , a Katherine who looked much like me but one who used the instrument of her voice better than I did my own piano , and I hated her . <p> I tried talking to Gerald about what was happening , but sympathetic as he tried to be , his " gift " was nowhere near as developed as mine , he truly did n't understand the full horror of what I was going through , and could offer no advice to help me cope with it . He seemed uncomfortable even talking about it , and after a few attempts I backed off , not wishing to lose a friendship , however flawed . <p> As I crossed campus one evening , on my way home , I caught a glimpse of Chris , heading alone toward the dormitories . I looked away , hoping he would n't see me , then , unable to resist , looked back for one last glance  --  and this time , he was no longer alone . This time , the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another Katherine  --  the dancer , Katrina , no mistaking the long legs , the regal face  --  her arm looped through his , her mouth open in a laugh . Chris  --  being in my world , of course  --  paid no attention to her , and after a few moments the dancer 's form rippled and vanished ; but I knew that in some other potential reality , another Chris walked with her , laughed with her , and I felt an anger and a compulsion rising within me . <p> I fell into step behind Chris , at a safe enough distance that he did n't notice . I knew I should turn around , knew I should go home right now , but I could n't , and as he entered Rose Hall I poked my head in just long enough to determine which room was his . First floor ; room six . I circled round the back of the dorm , found the window outside his room ; crouched beside a concealing shrub , watched the light snap on inside . Carefully I raised myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting at his desk , a small table lamp spilling light over textbooks and notepad computer . But though he did not realize it , he was not alone in the room . Less than five feet away , on his unmade bed , I saw her : the dancer : her nude body , toned and trim , lying on the sheets , her arms wrapped around something , someone , I could not see , her pelvis jerking back and forth , taking in that someone . She moaned ; she cried out his name . Chris , she said , oh , Chris ... It was almost comical ; it was crushing , horrible . I felt as though I 'd been physically struck ; I stumbled backwards , gravel crunching noisily underfoot , away from Katrina , but her sighs and the sound of Chris 's name seemed to follow me all the way home ... <p> That night , the sobbing echo in my apartment slowly stopped crying , falling into a silence I found even more disturbing ; she sat in a comer , half-dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to meet her eyes  --  the irises a flat blue , dimmed by some cataract of spirit  --  their dead light constantly threatening to pull me in , pull me down ... <p> Desperate to perform well at the Bach recital , I practiced as best I could , trying to ignore the echoes of better , more talented Katherines all around me . When the night arrived , I felt a twinge of an old excitement as I walked onto the stage at Alice Tully Hall wearing a simple but elegant white gown , joining an ensemble that included Gerald , another violinist , a flautist , a cellist , and myself . <p> The Musical Offering is a suite of tense , somber beauty , the first ricercare scored in this instance for piano ; I played well , I thought , due in no small part to my affinity for the mood of the piece : a lament of sorts , perfectly in keeping with my own mood . We moved from the first ricercare to the canons which followed , my piano playing at times with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , or not at all ( as in the fourth canon , a duet between Gerald and the other violinist ) . It was during one such moment , as I " sat out " and listened to the other instruments , that I began to hear  --  faintly but distinctly  --  the sound of another piano . A piano taking the same part the cello was now playing an echo from a reality in which this piece was arranged differently . The pianist , damn her , was brilliant , the technique letter-perfect . Her vigor and conviction so rattled me that I almost missed my entrance into the next ricercare , probably the most demanding part of the suite for me : I was not only performing it solo , I was playing six melodic lines all at the same time . Difficult under the best of circumstances  --  but now I heard the echo of that other piano , my piano , also performing the ricercare , but ever so slightly time-displaced ( my other self having begun the piece moments before I had ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six and a half minutes I struggled to keep my concentration , I felt my gown growing embarrassingly wet with perspiration , and when I finally finished the ricercare I felt not triumph but mere relief  --  and then disgust , convinced that my performance had suffered for it . I got a bit of a breather in the next three canons , but when we came to the sonata I once more found myself playing , in some strange quantum duet , the same part as my echo  --  and once again , not playing it as well , the echo 's rendering more controlled , the lamentation somehow deeper , truer , than mine . This was perhaps the bitterest pill of all to swallow : though I knew my share of torment , even at that there was someone better . <p> By the end of the recital I was drained , exhausted beyond anything I had ever known ; and though everyone congratulated me on a fine performance , I took no joy in it , and fled home to my apartment , fighting the temptation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not go to sight-singing class , for fear of hearing the Katherine with perfect pitch and soaring voice . I stayed at home and cranked up my stereo , Mathis der Maler again , in a desperate attempt to drown out the faintest whisper of any echoes . <p> The day after that I did n't go to piano class , terrified I might hear the same Katherine who had outclassed me in the recital . I stayed at home and left the television on all day , trying to fill the apartment with more acceptable ghosts , electronic ghosts , phosphor ghosts . <p> Gerald called , concerned at my absence from school . I told him that my mother was ill , that I was leaving that afternoon for Virginia , that I might be away for a while . He extended his sympathies and I took them . When he hung up , I switched on my answering machine and never turned it off . My parents left occasional messages and I answered them , keeping the conversations brief , pretending to a hectic schedule I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the crushing pretense of normality . <p> I left the apartment less and less , leaving only to buy groceries and pay the rent . I spent more and more of each day in bed , but , asleep , I seemed not to dream myself but to share the dreams of others : vivid , highly visual dreams filled with color and form , Robert 's dreams ; pleasant , happy dreams , the inner life of the gorgeous , red-headed Kathy , prosaic but peaceful ; jarring violent dreams of conflict and competition , Katja 's dreams ; dreams of movement and physicality , the gymnast 's dreams . At first I found them disturbing ; slowly they became a kind of narcotic , as I realized that through them I could , however briefly and incompletely , become my echoes . The redhead 's confidence , the gymnast 's grace , the ordered geometry of the math major 's mind . One moment I 'm the football player , reliving the glories of a touchdown , a thirty-yard pass , beer after the game , fast sweaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the next moment I 'm the singer , hearing/feeling the resonance in my voice , shaping the sound , diaphragm relaxed , the peculiar but satisfying sensation of being my own instrument ; a moment later my body is still my instrument but this time I manipulate it not just with voice but with posture , expression , movement , an actress 's devices . <p> I drift from dream to dream , mind to mind , the casual clutter of the actress 's thoughts , the laser-sharp focus of Katja 's , the passion and discipline of Katrina 's , all a welcome respite from me , from being me , and more and more I 'm not me , I 'm them ; I 'm only me when I have to be , when my body demands it . Asleep , I feel a pressure in my bladder and reluctantly I wake , dragging myself to the bathroom , relieving myself , sometimes getting something to eat , sometimes not , then returning to bed . This goes on for days ; weeks . And then one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more talented , I feel my body call and grudgingly answer , padding to the bathroom , doing what 's necessary , glancing into the vanity mirror on my way back to bed  --  <p> And I stopped , suddenly shaken by what I saw . <p> The Katherine in the mirror was half-dressed , her hair unruly and unwashed , with a dead light in her flat blue eyes that threatened to pull me in ; pull me down . It was the echo who 'd first appeared in the hospital , so many years before ; who 'd lain in a comer of my bed in Virginia and cried her lament of long years ; who joined me here , in New York , and whose sobs slowly gave way to silence and gray despair , in her eyes an ancestral memory of my grandfather . <p> But the echo was n't sitting in the corner . The echo was in my mirror . <p> I felt a surge of panic , the first emotion in weeks I had n't dreamed , had n't borrowed . I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to catch a glimpse of the echo , somewhere else in the apartment  --  but the echo was n't there . <p> Of course she was n't . I 'd become the echo . <p> Once , we had been separated by countless other probability lines ; other paths , the ones closest to me diverging only slightly , the ones closest to her diverging more . Slowly , subtly , I had traveled from one path to the next , like fingers moving absently from key to key on my piano , drawing closer and closer to her probability line ... until it became mine . I had made the transition so slowly , so gradually , that I had n't even realized it was happening . <p> At first I could n't accept it . It was n't truer this could n't be happening ! I raced out of the bedroom into the living room , still hoping , praying , that I might see my echo , that I was n't her  --  <p> I did n't see her in the living room , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who looked very much as I had , once : short dark hair , well-groomed , neatly dressed ... with bright , clear , sky-blue eyes , undimmed by time or pain . She was sitting at the piano , playing the Largo movement from the Musical Offering , and for a moment I thought she might have been the echo I 'd heard on stage at the recital ; but as I got close enough to see her fingers on the keys , close enough to recognize my own style , I knew that she was not . <p> I looked into her face , and was shocked by what I saw ; what I thought I saw . <p> Contentment ? Peace ? It had been so long since I had known anything like either , I was n't sure I recognized them . I tried to think when I had last felt such contentment , and I thought of the day I had moved in here , the joy I 'd felt , the promise of a brighter , happier life . <p> My heart sank . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lived that happier life . The life that should have been mine . The probability line I should have traveled  --  but I veered from it , taking a darker path . <p> My legs gave way beneath me , I dropped to the floor , and I cried . For how long , how many minutes or hours , I ca n't tell you now . But toward the end of it , as I gave up the grief I 'd held for too long , I began to understand something . Something I should have realized years before : <p> Some of my echoes were the result of chance ; but others were a product of choice . I did n't choose to be a musical prodigy  --  that was determined for me . But I had chosen to become what I was now : the sobbing echo . However unwittingly , I had chosen that . I had had that choice . <p> And if I had it then  --  I still did . <p> I still had a choice . <p> I did . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the first to imply the existence of probability waves  --  which I read about in my sessions with Doctor Carroll : Shoot a spray of electrons through two slits in a wall , onto a video screen where their impact can be recorded . The result ? An interference pattern from the overlapping waves of electrons . Fine ; that much makes sense . But shoot just one electron at a time through a slit , then look later at the cumulative pattern  --  and you find the identical interference pattern . Impossible , on the face of it : the electrons , having been projected one at a time , have n't actually overlapped . But apparently the thousands of potential electron paths exist , on a quantum level , with the one path the electron actually does travel  --  and they somehow influence it , limiting the paths the single electron can take . <p> It took me a long while to realize it , but in a way , I was like that electron : for too long , I allowed the thousands of potential lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life I was leading . Seeing the echoes of all I might have been , it was easy to forget that I was not just one of them ; that they in fact emanated from me , not simply from that one moment of genetic manipulation but from every moment thereafter as well . Human beings , unlike electrons , have free will  --  and I soon decided to exert it with a vengeance . <p> I dropped out of Juilliard and enrolled at a small college in upstate New York , leaving the majority of my quantum ghosts behind in Manhattan . My parents were appalled at the move ; even more so when I elected not to major in music , but to keep an open major , at least for a year or two . I took classes in art , in literature , in anthropology , any and all subjects that interested me  --  and was amazed to discover that I had both an affinity and an aptitude for something outside music . I would never have Robert 's artistic skills , but I could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own amusement ; I might never have the dancer 's grace at a ballet barre , but I could dance , I was not a hopeless klutz . I might never have the red-haired Kathy 's drop-dead , fashion-model looks  --  but I was pretty . I really was . <p> Because I had been designed from birth to be a musician , I had decided , like the electron , that there was only one path for me to take ; and having discovered that that was not the case , I 've had a richer , more interesting life than I might otherwise have dreamed . I 've climbed mountains in Nepal ; I 've ridden Irish thoroughbreds in County Monaghan . I 've been married , had two children : I 've written a sonata for violin and piano for my old friend Gerald , and illustrated a computer-generated children 's book for my four-year-old daughter . In my youth , I naively believed that life could be , should be , structured like a concerto : today I know better . I know that life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fugue of sorts , the promise and the sadness often separated by mere moments , tragedy and serenity not nearly so discrete as I once believed . And I 've known my share of both . <p> Through all of it , my echoes have never been far away : they are not far from me now . Now old like me , they surround me as I write this  --  one of them also sitting at a computer , not writing but paintings one of them playing a snatch of Gershwin on a flute ; another at the piano ; still another simply sitting and weeping , over what I am not quite sure . Occasionally , in big cities , I catch glimpses of others : I saw Robert on a street in Dallas and I think he recognized me , throwing me a Cheshire smile before vanishing ; I went to the ballet in New York and was surprised to find Katrina performing a ghostly turn as Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty , and I felt a surge not of envy but of pride . My echoes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them dies ( as , inevitably , they have begun to ) I mourn a little , as I would a sister . Each one , to be sure , still represents a different path , a different life . But the joy , the wonder , of it all is this : I have taken one path , but many turns ; I was granted one life , but lived many lives . The paths , the roads , may be infinite and beautiful ; but the journey is even more so . <p> <p> By Alan Brennert <p> Alan Brennert is one of our favorite writers . ( And if you missed the reasons why , I suggest you pick up the April 1996 issue , which contains his story , " The Refuge . " ) He writes very little short fiction , but when he does get around to a short story , it receives both attention and acclaim . He has won a Nebula award and an Emmy , and now that he 's turned his attention to feature films , we may watch him collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we hope he still finds time to produce gems like " Echoes .
