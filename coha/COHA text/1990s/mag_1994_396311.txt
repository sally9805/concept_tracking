December 23 , 1993 . I open a copy of USA Today to the headline " Holiday Rush on Firearms . " I read that " legions of Americans " are buying guns for Christmas , spurred by " a fear of crime and a dread of gun control . " Afraid that passage of the Brady Bill is only the first step toward gun-control legislation that will leave them unarmed in a nation of gunslingers , the legions are giving gun dealers what one calls their best sales year in two decades . Santa Claus , on the other hand , is having a hard time . On the same day , the New York Times reports that Santa has been recalled from the malls of Denver because a mysterious letter writer threatens to blow " that Fatso " away . Christmas-sprited cops dress up in Santa suits , safely within the walls of police stations , and listen to the wish lists of kids who probably hope for Uzis of their own . It 's all in there , in a single day 's news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pick up any paper and read the daily dispatches from the domestic war zone . You 'll find the record of violent acts the threaten everything we once thought precious or safe . And these days you 'll find as well the stories of gun shoppers , male and female , who share the desperate conviction that only our own readiness to do violence can protect us from violence . Interviewed in People , President Clinton says : " Nearly everybody who lives in any kind of an urban area today , and increasingly in medium-size and small towns , feels a significantly hgiher level of personal insecurity than they did a few years ago . They look over their shoulders more , they worry more about who they speak to on the street . There is a level of anxiety there that did n't exist , because nearly everybody knows somebody who has been victimized . " That anxiety about random violence currently inspires yet another crackdown on crime in the United States . Both Republicans and Democrats rant about law and order . They team up to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camps " and jails and still more prisons , though already , in the ones we have , we lock up more of our citizenry per capita than any other nation on earth . On television , in between violent entertainment prgrams , news programs examine our violent society , interviewing cops and convicts and drug pushers and teenage gang members and even children who are shooting and being shot at in unprecendented numbers . Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala reports that if current trends continues , gunshots will replace car crashes as the leading cause of death by injury in the U.S. by the year 2003 . " Among young adults ages 25 to 34 , " she says , " the crossover has already occurred on a nationwide basis . " And " Americans , " as the president says , " look over their shoulders . " Missing from this national debate on crime is any mention of the crime the poses the greatest danger to women : rape and/or assault by a current or former boyfriend or husband . Battering is now the single leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 and 44 , sending more than a million women every year to doctors ' offices or emergency rooms for treatment . It drives women into the streets , too : 50 percent of homeless women and kids across the U.S. are fleeing from male violence . It figures in one quarter of all suicide attempts by women and in one half of all suicide attempts by African American women . It also accounts for untold damage to fetuses in utero ; 25 to 30 percent of pregnant women are battered , according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence . And every day in the U.S. four women are murdered by men who say they love them . Generally , battering does not count as " crime . " As recently as 1991 , only 17 states recorded incidents of male violence against women in the home , and most confined reporting to " serious " bodily injury , rape , and murder . Officially , battering does not even count as " violence . " In the " family violence " establishment , academics ( mostly male ) have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " partner abuse " to obscure both the severity of violent acts performed at home and the gender of the perpetrators . What we 've learned to call " domestic violence " has come to seem but a pale imitation of the real thing . This is hardly what we expected when in 1970 feminists began one of the most dramatic social reform efforts in the nation 's history : we brought the issue of battering out of the private home and into public consciousness . Yet in just two decades , male violence has been so thoroughly " domesticated " once again that even some feminists say they 've had enough of cringing victims . They want to talk about power . Enter the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) . With deficits deepening , membership declining , and no pal in the White House , the NRA spent almost $29 million in 1992 but could n't shoot down the Brady Bill . Undoubtedly depressed at the result , the NRA turns for comfort  --  where else ?  --  to women ( see page 46 ) . It finds feminist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims or against them ?  --  and cleverly launches an appeal to both sides . Always adept at marketing , the NRA taps into the sentiments of those women who extol women 's power and reject what they call " victim feminism . " At the same time , it plays to the real terror of millions of U.S. women who are still victimized by men who are their partners or lovers . " Refuse To Be a Victim , " the NRA says glibly , couching its ad campaign in the feminist language of choice , cynically co-opted from the campaign for reproductive rights . Appealing at once to women 's empowerment and to women 's fear , the NRA 's ad campaign could not be more timely or better planned . Do n't think for a minute they have our best interests at heart . During recent campaigns in several states for legislation authorizing police to confiscate guns from men who assault women or violate restraining orders , the NRA said nothing . We 're simply warm bodies in the great untapped female market for armaments . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range from 11 percent to the NRA 's 17 percent , but everyone agrees that relatively few of the 211 million firearms in this country belong to women . Like teenagers seduced by cigarette advertisers , or African Americans targeted with booze billboards , women too are a " special " market . We too have a pocket to be picked . Which is why women today face the question : to buy or not to buy a gun ? It 's a new dilemma . And troublesome . It leaves women torn . Your mind says one thin , your gut another . Your beliefs and your instincts may not match up at all . We 're supposed to be society 's peacemakers , or so tradition and conditioning tell us . And most U.S. women do consistently favor gun control . While many male lawmakers knuckle under year after year to the NRA lobby . Prominent women , both in and out of Congress , stand up to them and help to redefine the issue . The final vote on the Brady Bill makes the gender gap plain : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage , while 81 percent of women were for the bill ; in the Senate , it was 60 percent of men , 100 percent of women . The " right to bear arms " ( so dear to the NRA ) is , after all , not an individual right but a collective right , for the purpose of maintaining a state militia . And as individual ownership of guns increasingly menaces public health and safety , more and more women take a stand against " macho " myths and for the general welfare , which is what the men who wrote the Second Amendment had in mind in the first place . Surgeon GeneraI Joycelyn Elders labels gun violence " one of the leading public health issues in America , " implying that guns , like any other product that potentially threatens public health  --  cigarettes , for example , or food additives  --  should be subject to strict regulation and taxation . Hillary Rodham Clinton says she thinks a campaign to tax guns and ammunition as health hazards  --  the proceeds to go to health care reform  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D.-N.Y. ) attacks the NRA head-on . But then there 's Lorena Bobbitt . Although she armed herself with a plain kitchen knife rather than a gun , her dramatic refusal to be a victim anymore produced one of those metaphoric moments when the dark side of gender relations suddenly lies exposed . The same male commentators who matter-of-factly report rape , torture , and genocide in Bosnia launched the full ballistic vocabulary to describe Lorena Bobbitt 's act : ghastly , unforgivable , unthinkable . Yet women could think it , and worse , laugh . Lorena Bobbitt 's crime was that she made it look so easy  --  a stroke of a sharp knife . I mention this because the widespread understanding among women of Lorena Bobbitt 's act , even as one feminist spokesperson after another publicly condemned it , reveals a certain off-the-record vein of vengefulness , a mother lode of anger , a vast buildup of unrequited insults and injuries . Mostly we pretend it 's not there . We 're ladylike and polite . But there it is , welling up from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the street when Lorena Bobbitt is acquitted . Women cheer in the movie theater when Louise pulls the trigger on that scumbag wanna-be rapist in the parking lot . It 's like living on an emotional fault line ; we go along calmly and then one day , boom , some little incident sets us quaking with laughter that smacks of sweet revenge . This behavior disturbs men , who do their best to make women in general and feminists in particular disavow it . Some men say we hate them . Some men say  --  get this !  --  that we condone violence against them . But some men try to sell us guns . " Refuse To Be a Victim , " they say  --  though only on their terms and with their products . All the while male violence against women continues unabated . A battering every 15 seconds , a rape every 46 seconds , a femicide every two hours . Women do n't choose to be victims , but these days there 's no end of opportunities in that line . Women are fearful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond feat . We 're fed up . That 's what the cheering is about , and the high fives , and the laughter . Sweet revenge . Women 's interest in guns  --  such as it is  --  is n't just about fear . It 's about fighting back . I know something about fighting back myself  --  and about the consolations of a gun . In 1969 I took a job teaching at an African American college in the South , a job some local white citizens thought unsuitable for a white woman . They encouraged me to go back home . They drove down my street at all hours , shouting and waving a Confederate flag . They beat my dog nearly to death . They fired buckshot at my house . A black friend of mine , a former marine , gave me a handgun , a .38 special , and he and I made conspicuous trips to the public shooting range for target practice . After that , the racists left me alone . But they left me diminished , too . I 'd grown up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for complicated reasons personal and political  --  I 'd promised myself not to use them anymore . Then , in the face of the white citizens ' welcome , my principles had simply vanished . As a kid , I 'd hunted with my dad from the time I was big enough to fire a shotgun without being flattened by the recoil . It was a great pleasure during those growing up years , walking the damp brown autumn woods and cornfields of northern Wisconsin with a .20 gauge under my arm , watching for the sudden thunder of partridge or pheasant on the rise . But at 18 I shot my first deer , and as I watched it die in the snow , the deadly and irrevocable consequence of what I was doing came home to me . I could n't stop weeping . ( Yes , I know , " just like a girl . " ) I never went hunting again , but because the shotgun had been a gift from my father , I kept it . Many years later , on April 4 , 1968 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Memphis . I borrowed a canoe , paddled to the middle of a lake near my home , and dropped my old shotgun over the side . It was a ridiculous gesture , I suppose , impelled by grief and fury at the slaughter of Dr. King and the collective dream he had inspired . But I wanted to rid the world of guns and all the violence and death they seemed to represent ; at least I could get rid of mine . The nonviolent path of Dr. King would be my own . Only a year later , I went South and lost my resolution to a bunch of hopped-up racists waving a Confederate flag . A long time after that , life gave me a second chance , and I failed again . While I was investigating a murder for one of my books , a man whispered death threats into my answering machine . Similar threats , cut and pasted together from newspapers , arrived unstamped in the mailbox , apparently delivered by hand . Someone broke into the house when I was away and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows open wide . I searched through my things for that old .38 special , loaded it , and kept it on my desk while I wrote . At night I put it under my pillow . When I left the house , I took it along to have it handy when I came home again and searched every corner , every closet , every cubbyhole before sitting down once more at my desk . For six months , that pistol made it possible for me to go through the motions of life and to go on working . But this time I understood the lesson I 'd only half-learned in that southern town : the threat of violence , if it makes you play by its rules , is just as deadly to the spirit as violence itself . It was n't a gun I needed . It was courage . Now when I read of women buying guns to gain a sense of power and control it makes me sad , for I imagine them afflicted with the same incapacitating fear and the same profound anger at being made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of battering and stalking and attempted murder I 've talked to over the years . And some I never had a chance to meet , women like April LaSalata . In February 1988 , her ex-husband , Anthony , broke into her home on Long Island , New York , armed with a sawed-off rifle and a knife , and stabbed her several times in the chest . She survived , and he was charged with attempted murder  --  then released on 25,000 bail . The county prosecutor begged the judge to increase the bail and hold LaSalata in jail . Request denied . April LaSalata applied for a permit to carry a gun to protect herself . Permit denied . In January 1989 , Anthony waited for April to return from work , then shot her twice in the head on her own doorstep . She was 34 . If April LaSalata had been granted that gun permit , could she have saved herself ? Maybe so . Maybe not . As a practical matter , leaving the human drama aside and looking at the studies and the numbers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having a gun in your home makes it three times as likely that someone will be killed there . And that someone may be you or your child . With children in the house , the only way to keep a gun safely is to break it down , hide it , and hide the bullets elsewhere  --  and in that condition it 's of no use in an emergency . On the other hand , having a gun at the ready endangers children who may play with it or use it as a weapon . Between 1979 and 1991 , nearly 50,000 children under the age of 20 were killed , by accident or design , with firearms , reports the Children 's Defense Fund . Having a gun at the ready may also be fatal for you , if you 're on the losing end of a struggle with an intruder . But a woman is much less likely to be attacked by an intruder or by a stranger in a public area than by the man she lives with . Bring a gun into the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member might use it to attempt suicide ; unlike sleeping pills , a gun is a virtually faultless suicide weapon , offering no second chance . About 48 percent of deaths caused by firearms are suicides . But suppose you actually manage to use your gun to wound or kill an attacker in self-defense . If you 've shot an unknown intruder with a legally licensed gun , you may or may not have to stand trial . But if you 've shot the man you live with , or used to live with , your troubles have only just begun . I 've spent too much time in too many prisons talking to too many women who say they killed batterers in self-defense , and who are now locked up for 15 or 20 years or life without parole , to think that " justifiable " homicide is easily justified when a woman pulls the trigger on a man . Consider the anguish these women go through , and their terrible loss of freedom . Still , it 's better than being dead . But if we want to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the safety and protection and greater empowerment of women , should we be talking about guns at all ? I remember a conversation years ago with a group of women in an Indiana prison . Each had killed a husband or boyfriend and was serving a long sentence . One said , " When I get out of here , I ' ' 11 never have a gun around the house again . " Said another : " If I ever get out of here , I ' ' 11 never have a man around the house , " tracing her problem to its source . How do we arm women with awareness and the courage to live free of violence ! And more to the point , how do we stop violent men ? That 's not a job to be done piecemeal by lone women , armed with pearl-handled pistols , picking off batterers and rapists one by one . It 's a job for the collective power of women and men . It should never have to be up to the April LaSalatas of the world to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to kill them . The law could have saved April , and should have , and would have , if women mattered . Men continue to rape and batter and assault and kill  --  in a word , to victimize  --  women . But if those women do n't matter in our society , then why should women matter to the courts or the cops or all those congressmen so diligently building prisons to lock up everybody but batterers ? I 'm all for empowering victims , and after the relentless crime wave that men have waged undeterred against women all these years  --  even , and especially , in the so-called safety of home  --  I 'd sure like to see us get our own back . Still , I think it 's fair to say that when we took up the fight for women 's rights , the right to bear arms was not what we had in mind . We imagined a just country in which cops and courts would defend , if need be , a woman 's constitutional right to be free from bodily harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races and backgrounds and ages and both sexes could live together in harmony and cooperation , a world where classes and gender conflict would disappear , where there would be no cause for warfare and violence . Idealistic ? Yes . But it seemed to me , and still does , the only kind of world worth struggling for . Instead we live now in a country where every two minutes somebody gets shot . Where every 14 minutes some body dies from a gunshot wound . Where every 2 hours a child is killed by someone with a gun . We live in a country where in 1991 guns killed 38,317 people . Where every day four men track down and kill the women they claim to love . A world where popular , state-of-the-art , so-called feminist Naomi Wolf cites pistol-packin mamas in NRA publications as splendid examples of " pioneer feminism . " Maybe I 'd be safer if I bought another handgun and practiced up . Maybe I 'd be safer still with an Uzi . But safer for what ? That 's not the world I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the days of war in Vietnam : " Someday they 'll give a war and nobody will come . " I 'm still working on that . And in the meantime , if you want to pack a piece in the gunslinger society , please do n't mistake your hardware for power . Ann Jones 's books on violence include " Women Who Kill " ( Fawcett ) and the recently published " Next Time , She 'll Be Dead : Battering and How to Stop It " ( Beacon ) . <p>
