<p> A fifth juror or alternate was booted off the O.J. Simpson wrongful death trial jury Tuesday , but the judge gave no reason and warned remaining jurors not to speculate about why . <p> Attorneys were nearly finished with their sometimes acrimonious questioning of defense pathologist Dr. Michael Baden when court recessed for lunch . <p> Right after lunch , Superior Court Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki told the jurors who returned that one of their number was missing . <p> He warned them not to speculate why , not to talk to anyone about the case , not to form opinions or even let anyone know they were part of the Simpson jury . <p> On Nov. 26 , aspiring actress and alternate juror Ann-Marie Jamison was dismissed for what the judge said was improper contact with one of the legal teams . Jamison said she merely commented that she liked the tie worn by a technician who puts up evidence displays in court . <p> Two other alternates have been dismissed : a woman who got caught sleeping and man who got sick .

Simpson told the jury he cut his hand again after he got back , perhaps while wrestling with his young son . <p> " He said he cut himself a lot , and he does have a lot of scars , " Baden conceded during questioning by plaintiff attorney Edward Medvene . <p> At some point , Baden testified , he remembered Simpson saying " he was rummaging around in his car and somehow noticed blood on his hand .

" I 've never said that . " <p> " He stood up two to three minutes and blood came down and he collapses , " said Baden , New York City 's former chief medical examiner . <p> Medvene then asked if Baden told a national TV audience that Goldman was standing for five or 10 minutes .

The pathologist later said the difference between two , three and five minutes did n't matter significantly . <p> Medvene was trying to compress the time line to conform with testimony from pathologist Dr. Werner Spitz , who appeared for the plaintiffs . A shorter time line favors the plaintiffs because it would give Simpson time to kill the victims , ditch bloody clothing and a weapon and return home in time to catch a limousine ride to the airport . <p> Baden repeated his conclusion that Goldman died slowly because his first wound was to the jugular vein , which bleeds slowly . <p> Medvene displayed pictures of Goldman 's bloody shirt and showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , away from the jugular . <p> Baden insisted the amount of blood on the left side , although less pooled , was consistent with a jugular vein wound . <p> Baden conceded there were some facts in the autopsy report that pointed to one attacker and that the victims could have been killed fairly quickly . <p> But he balked at Medvene 's claim that " a motivated killer " would kill more quickly . <p> " I ca n't read motivation or intent , " Baden retorted . Emphatically , he added , " Mr. Medvene , I do n't think this was accidental . A killer killed Mrs. Simpson . All killers are motivated , and dying - being killed - is terrible whether it 's one wound or 10 . " <p> The judge frequently interrupted with rulings as the two men sparred . He told Baden repeatedly to answer Medvene 's questions , even when Medvene asked Baden to compare the killings to the slaughter of an animal . <p> " I 've never seen an animal being slaughtered , ' Baden said . " Slaughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Monday , during direct examination , Baden said silence during the killings indicated to him that more than one person attacked them . <p> " I ca n't understand how these two people could have been murdered and not yelled out unless there were two , " he said . <p> " Neither victim was incapacitated or unable to cry for help , " he said . " One can yell , ' Help , ' five times in a second or two seconds . " <p> Most witnesses have testified that the quiet was interrupted only by barking dogs .
