Our inland seas are really two-tiered fisheries . Salmon and trout are nomads in an expanse of shifting thermal zones that dictate their movement and that of their forage , while smallmouth bass , yellow perch , and walleyes are more structure-oriented , their actions governed primarily by the location of rocky structure and vegetation . Each of the Great Lakes has a unique makeup and calendar of movements , but general patterns of fish behavior do exist . ( And they apply to other , mostly northern , lakes that might not be Great but are real big , nevertheless . ) Some salmonids , like steelhead and chinook salmon , wander far and wide until mid- to late-summer , when they move closer to shore and eventually to river mouths prior to their spawning runs . Lake trout and browns , by contrast , remain further inshore all summer , though they , too , are controlled by temperature regimens . Even walleyes and yellow perch make significant moves throughout the summer . With all this movement it 's no wonder , then , that fish-finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Lakes . And why being able to identify summertime haunts is critical to success on these vast expanses . 1 . THERMAL BARS Summer anglers have to follow nomadic rainbows offshore to where walls of cold and warmer water collide . These vertical thermal bars , which on the surface appear as adjacent masses of slick , heavy-looking water and riffly warmer water , collect insects and trash to form " scum " lines . Steelhead feed below these lines , particularly when they appear 10 to 12 and 15 to 20 miles away from shore . In deep portions of Lake Michigan , these thermal barriers can last into mid-July , but they break up earlier elsewhere , giving way to normal horizontal water stratification ( when deeper water becomes uniformly cooler than water above it ) and the formation of the thermocline ( a horizontal band of water that from its top to bottom gets cooler quicker than the water above and below the band ) . Thermoclines are often distinct enough to appear on fish-finder screens . With the breakup of thermal barriers , steelhead become open-water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently moving into water as high as 6S ' to feed . Anglers can keep track of schools using GPS but will still burn plenty of fuel trying to keep up with these nonstop summertime nomads . 2 . STAGING ZONES In late summer , king salmon that have been ranging in open water 60 to 90 feet deep in their favorite temperature range , the low 50s , begin moving closer to shore . Here they congregate in slightly warmer water not far from river mouths in preparation for their spawning runs . Humps , long underwater points , and troughs attract them , as do nearby sandy bottom areas on occasion . Prevailing winds begin to pile up warm surface water on windward shores in late summer . Those coastal waters that are sheltered from prevailing winds are therefore cooler , and consequently they hold prespawn chinooks closer to mainland masses before other areas do . 3 . RUBBLE AND REEFS In summer , the thermocline begins to distinguish itself , and where this zone intersects reefs and irregular rocky structure rising from the bottom fish are almost sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such areas when a band of water between 43deg and 55deg ( 51deg being ideal ) intersects structure . Lakers prefer a thermocline within 10 feet of bottom or one that intersects reef structure , but they will suspend off reefs and long , tapered underwater points . If the temperature is right on reefs in water under 100 feet deep , lakers will be there if the forage is. 4 . INSHORE THERMOCLINES Reefs and rocks , sunken islands , troughs between islands and humps , and rubble all attract brown trout . Like lake trout , browns relate to the thermocline , but they generally do so in shallower water , where the cool-water band is likely to lie closer to the bottom . Browns commonly suspend 10 or more feet above the thermocline , but on rare occasions they work bottom structure where it intersects the band . Browns rarely venture more than three miles offshore , preferring to be as close to land as temperature permits . 5 . DROPS AND BASINS Drop-offs into muddy basins attract summer walleyes , which suspend over these bottoms 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth . In fact , in some of the deeper basins of Lake Erie , steelhead ranges overlap with those of walleyes . Do n't overlook the drop-offs into deep shipping channels , which lure walleyes and perch schools as well . 6 . OFF-ISLAND STRUCTURE Small rock rubble , boulder fields , slab ledges , long rocky points , stair-step drops , deep saddles between islands , and drops to softer bottom are attractors for schools of yellow perch and smallmouth bass . Walleye schools not suspended over deep basins will also use those reefs isolated off islands . 7 . ROCKS , LEDGES , AND BOULDERS Points , ledges , boulders , and saddles in water 8 to 25 feet deep are prime places for smallmouth bass . Likewise , any areas off rocks and ledges that give way to soft , vegetated bottom are good feeding shelves , especially during low-light conditions . And humps near islands in even deeper water can hold smallies and yellow perch , which move shallower  --  to the surface of deeper water and toward shore  --  to feed . <p>   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
