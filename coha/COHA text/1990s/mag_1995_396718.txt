WHICH ARE THE LOVE RElationships we hold most dear and would most like to duplicate in our own lives ? We may not achieve it ourselves , but contemporary Americans are especially admiring of endurance in love . Given a choice among models of romance , they voted most often for the long-running personal and professional bond between Hume Cronyn and the late Jessica Tandy . That enduring closeness and collegiality make the most inspiring model of love in our time is one of several surprises that turned up in a new PSYCHOLOGY TODAY survey . To probe the psyche of love , the magazine commissioned Lifescapes/American Dialogue to poll 250 people on America OnLine . First bit of advice from the resulting road map to romance : Save your money . Some 62 percent of respondents consider a bouquet of wildflowers spontaneously plucked from the side of the road to be much more romantic than a dozen long-stemmed red roses ; just 38 percent felt otherwise . And almost two to one they prefer a candlelit dinner at home to one at a fancy restaurant ( 66 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men and women do not speak the same language  --  especially when it comes to love . For Valentine 's Day , four times as many women would rather receive tickets to a concert or show as would opt for a $100 gift certificate ( 33 vs. eight percent ) . More would even opt for that night out than would want a dozen roses ( 28 percent ) . Interestingly , more women would prefer a luxurious cashmere sweater ( 18 percent ) to a " friendship " ring ( 19 percent ) from their lover . But men , by a wide margin , would rather send flowers . Some 59 percent consider a dozen roses to be the best expression of their affection on Valentine 's Day . Another 18 percent would prefer to send a " friendship " ring , while 12 percent would consider tickets to a concert or show an ideal gift . Just six percent would consider presenting their lover with a $100 gift certificate while another six percent would opt to give a cashmere sweater . Men and women may not speak the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . Given a choice among romances  --  the quirky Lyle Lovett and Julia Roberts , the sturdy Jane Pauley and Garry Trudeau , the emotional Romeo and Juliet , the mature yet still illicit Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Maurice Templesman , the enduring and close-knit Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn , and that of their parents  --  those polled put their faith foremost in Tandy and Cronyn ( 36 percent ) . A close second was their parents ( 30 percent ) . Only 10 percent longed for the all-consuming passion Shakespeare 's teens felt , while just six percent each wanted to model their relationship on the Lovetts , Trudeaus , or the former first lady and her diamond-merchant companion . That may explain why , by a margin of three to one , panelists find a couple renewing their wedding vows on their 25th anniversary to be more romantic than a couple exchanging marriage vows for the first time ( 75 vs. 25 percent ) despite all those fragrance ads featuring an obviously first-time bride . The fact that half of all marriages end in divorce may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but it does require energy . When asked to discern signs of love , respondents cited a partner , unasked , taking on a chore that they themselves usually labor over ( 36 percent ) . A phone call made or a card sent for no specific reason was close behind ( 34 percent ) . Less welcome signs of love were a surprise visit to one 's workplace or home ( 17 percent ) and uncomplainingly accompanying one 's lover to a restaurant only he or she adores ( 13 percent ) . Respondents would welcome a hug only slightly more than a back rub but significantly more than being called by a pet name . They 'd also be touched by being lent a scarf or gloves when it 's cold  --  a modern expression of chivalry . As for phone protocol , respondents are divided on the value of not being put on hold ; they ca n't decide whether it 's significant or meaningless . How do you know you 're in love ? Which experiences clue you in ? Apparently it 's your anxiety level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that they worry about their " friend . " Twenty-seven percent know when they laugh at the same joke , while for 25 percent it 's when they impulsively call to check in . For 14 percent , the tip-off comes when they move their internal body clock from owl to lark or vice versa to coincide with their partner 's biorhythms . WHAT WILL DO THE MOST TO SEAL love for the long haul ? Having a child together slightly edges out buying a home together . Still significant , but in third place , is comingling finances . Sharing a religion is significantly more of a long-term bond than sharing political views . And when it comes to quashing feelings of love , a partner 's affair will do it for more people than anything else . On a scale of one to five , from least to most significance , an outside liaison scored a whopping 4.67 . Other potent love killers : a lie or other deceit scored 4.38 ; inattentiveness 3.78 ; and little sexual interest weighed in at 3.70 . Bad grooming can cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences such as parents , children , or work can also douse ardor ( 2.71 ) . The onset of emotional problems such as depression in one 's partner scored a moderate 2.46 , but the loss of a job or the loss of status only 1.75 . Lack of money registered just 2.07  --  less than if one 's partner suddenly gained 30 pounds ( 2.15 ) . Illegal activity is another strong love killer  --  trailing just behind sexual disinterest . A partner doing something illegal rates a 3.27 . And if that illegality is publicly censured , a la Marion Barry , it 's 3.56 . And what will turn love on ? Music from a piano is most romantic ( 92 percent ) , followed by the saxophone and human voice ( each 28 percent ) , while the violin scores a mere 11 percent . In fact , respondents are almost equally divided over whether being serenaded by a violinist in a restaurant is romantic or annoying . Only 13 percent would be captivated by being unexpectedly " kidnapped " for a weekend away at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly more people find couples who kiss and cuddle in public to be an exhilarative rather than an eyesore ( 52 vs. 48 percent ) . And only 26 percent consider couples who call each other cutesy names in public to be an earsore . Fully 74 percent consider that romantic . But getting married in Las Vegas is not . Almost three of four ( 72 percent ) consider it tacky , although it 's not as egregious as couples who wear matching outfits ( 92 percent ) . But our tacky-meters are not consistently sensitive . Some 62 percent consider renewing wedding vows after just five years of marriage to be romantic ; 38 percent find it tacky . If you 're thinking of printing a Valentine 's love note in the newspaper , go ahead . Chances are the object of your affection will be pleased ( 60 percent ) . Slightly more than a third would be put off by a marriage proposal on TV , in skywriting or any other public venue , although most would not . Even getting married in a hot-air balloon or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs. 47 percent ) . Actions do n't always speak louder than words , though . Almost half of respondents ( 45 percent ) verbally declare their love to their significant other more than once a day . Another eight percent parse out the message once a day , while 15 percent speak it about once a week , and two percent once a month or so . Only four percent rarely utter those powerful words . Astonishingly , one of four  --  25 percent  --  never do , two percent because they do n't have a significant other . " Tell them too often , and they 'll assume you do n't mean it , " said one respondent for the minority view . How often would people really like to be whispered sweet nothings ? Forty-one percent say they want to hear they 're adored more than once a day ; 18 percent need those words once daily . Another 22 percent are content with once a week , while two percent can get by on once a month or so . Then there 's 18 percent who say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always speak louder than words . Most respondents make a dear distinction between love and romance . " You ca n't have romance  --  that " dreamy " feeling  --  unless you are really in love , " says one . But most say love is broader and can include family members  --  even a spouse  --  in a nonromantic way . " Romance is a part of partner love , " says one . " Love is larger  --  extending to children , parents , family , friends , and others . " LOVE IS MORE ENDURING . " LOVE IS sticking together through the good times and bad . Romance is just the fun part . " Or " Love is the way you feel ; romantic activities just express the mood . " Another : " One is a fairy tale , ethereal ; the other is lasting . " Others distinguish between emotion and action . " Love is what you feel ; romance is how you act upon that love , " says one . " Love is a feeling . Romance is more of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other until the love is entirely mutual . Then romance keeps the bond alive . " But nothing is absolute in the terrain of love . Says one respondent , " You can have romance without love but probably can not have love without romance . " " Romance is the creative spark of love , little things you do together , like walking hand in hand , and big things , too , like surprising each other with a trip to Europe , " notes one poll participant . " Romance makes babies , and love is what keeps your husband in the delivery room with you when he feels like fainting ! " Romance is the flourish ; love , the solid foundation . " I like the flourishes , but it 's the knowledge and agreement between us that we 'll be there for each other and accept one another for our faults that keeps a relationship going when there are no flourishes . " " Love is caring and sharing . Romance is wining and dining . It 's how you show your love . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotion because you know he really does not want the added pressure , even though the extra money would help pay bills and its absence forces you to work more hours than you want . " " Romance is going to dinner at a five-star restaurant ; love is making sure the waiter knows about your wife 's food allergies . " Asked to create a romantic day or evening , people favor breakfast in bed , picnics in the country , elegant dinners with wine or champagne , and a Jacuzzi . Room service has its appeal . Almost all want a prolonged session for tender lovemaking . For most people , romance is dressing down . For some it 's dressing up . " A great romantic day would include a picnic-and dress up for dinner out , " said one . Another would include " a swim in a secluded ocean cove , a horseback ride , and a picnic lunch made by a famous chef . " " A surprise event arranged by a partner that allows for time to be spent together without interruption . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dressed up to go somewhere . His attention would be on me . He 'd never call his office to check for crises or take calls on his portable phone . " " We ride horses on a remote trail on a sunny day for hours , stopping at a meadow with a long view of the valley for lunch . We joke , stretch out in the sun , kiss , ride back and do chores together , then sit back and watch the sunset over a glass of wine . " <p>
