// If you have MS , it pays to know the basics about health insurance and about government entitlement programs so you can successfully protect your own interests . Ten years ago old acquaintances of mine , Sara Perkins and her husband Lanny , coauthored the book , MS : Your Legal Rights . They are both attorneys . Sara and I were diagnosed with MS in 1984 . When the book was first published in 1988 , she had retired and was drawing Social Security disability insurance ( SSDI ) benefits . This summer , they will issue a revised edition . Despite changes in the law since 1988 , the Perkinses agree that living successfully with a medical problem like MS is still a hard job . " You ca n't just say , I 'm sick ' , " said Mr. Perkins . " You have to be alert and look out for yourself . You have legal rights , but you have to make sure they get enforced . " It helps to have good advocates on your side-like a doctor who is savvy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff do n't always understand how insurance or entitlement programs work . That 's scary , because what doctors do or do n't write when they complete an insurance form or claim for disability is often the deciding factor in whether you receive benefits . Being a good self-advocate means learning for yourself and being aware that you may need to educate your health-care team . Get a grip ! There are two important moves to make . First , understand your present health insurance policy . If reading it numbs your brain , get help from your plan administrators . There is someone on the staff who can explain it to you , so you know what is and is n't covered , and , importantly , what your policy requires you to do . Second , make a habit of documenting . Keep files of everything pertaining to your health insurance claims , your health problems , and the care you receive . " Use a tape recorder if you ca n't or do n't want to write or type a daily journal . Record dates and reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ms. Perkins advised . " Trying to recall things later is too hard . After living with MS for a time , most people tend to forget the details and ongoing symptoms of their disease . " The doctor 's professional records are the most credible to insurance or disability benefits administrators , Ms. Perkins said . However , personal records can be used as evidence in a legal proceeding . They can also be helpful to you and your doctors in making treatment decisions . Marc D. Stolman , author of A Guide to Legal Rights for People with Disabilities , agrees . " Memories yours and your doctors ' - are n't good enough , " he said . He 's also an attorney who has MS . " Document and ask your doctors to document , " he repeated . And be sure your doctor understands what you need . " If you are applying for Social Security disability insurance , the doctor must be able to show that your MS condition limits your ability to perform basic work activities , " he said . It 's OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy of the Social Security Administration 's guide for physicans , often called " The Blue Book " ( see page 29 ) . More urgent than ever Insurance reimbursements and disability benefits have always been important to people with MS . With recent understanding about the benefits of using one of the new disease-modifying drugs such as Avonex , Betaseron , or Copaxone , the issue is even more urgent . These drugs are expensive , and HMOs , insurance companies , and government agencies have not always made good decisions about granting coverage for them . To support insurance claims and to help persuade government programs to include these medications in their coverage , the National MS Society issued a Disease Management Consensus Statement . Ask your chapter to send a copy to your insurance provider if the need arises-or download it from the Society 's web site ( www.nmss.org ) . Insurance basics In his book , Health Insurance : How to Get It , Keep It , or Improve What You 've Got , Robert Enteen , PhD , starts with basics : Private insurance providers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coverage Not-for-profit service benefit plans , the largest and best known of which is Blue Cross and Blue Shield Large corporations or voluntary and professional organizations with their own self-insured plans Government insurance Medicare , available from the federal government mainly to people 65 or olderor to those who have a disability and have been receiving Social Security disability insurance benefits for at least 2 years . ( A few other categories of people are also eligible . ) Medicaid , available through state/federal partnership to people with limited income and assets who meet eligibility requirements . Insurance for veterans and their dependents . Insurance for federal and state employees . Managed care Managed care is now offered by all types of health insurance providers . The term includes health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) that combine insurance with direct delivery of care and the preferred provider organizations ( PPOs ) that offer discounted medical bills if certain providers are used . Blurred distinctions In many states , Medicaid coverage is now provided through private managed care organizations that have contracts with the state . Thus people insured by Medicaid-as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are shopping for insurance on their own-are being persuaded , urged , or even pushed to change from traditional fee-for-service insurance plans to an HMO . Do these distinctions matter ? Yes . The insurance industry is regulated by lawsby state laws or by federal laws-and blurred distinctions may make it hard for consumers to know what they have . If you 're not sure , ask your insurance administrators . If your insurance is employersponsored , it is probably federally controlled . // Advocacy services // Federal consumer protections are generally weak . For example , you have no right to sue for damages . If your insurance is state regulated , the consumer protections may be stronger , depending on what state you live in . Every state has a department of insurance mandated to educate and advocate on behalf of consumers . Some offer excellent protections , and some are less than adequate . Since Medicaid is a federal program administered by state governments , and most states have some say about how the program functions within its borders , the protections and appeal procedures available will vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an obligation to know the rights , requirements , and appeal opportunities in their health insurance plan . It 's smart to know what changes are being considered , and what options might be open as well . Your state insurance department should be able to provide information about all the insurance plans available within the state , and it should be able to steer you to information about any pending state legislation on health insurance issues . Coverage denied ! What happens when your insurance company refuses a claim or your HMO refuses a treatment ? If you decide to fight , first ask them for a written statement-on letterhead paper-with an explanation of the decision and the reason behind it . Then check your contract . Ask for clarification if necessary . Do you have a good reason to fight ? " Your doctor should be able to provide documentation of what is essential for your care , " said Nancy Law , head of the Society 's client programs . She recommends asking the physician for assistance at this point . You will be in better shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Perkinses and Marc Stolman advise . Follow the rules for appeal provided by your insurer , and during the dispute , continue to ask for information in writing from your health insurance provider . Keep a record of every phone call too , with the names of people who spoke to you , the date , and notes about what was said by whom . If an appeal fails , and if your plan is state regulated , there may be some other levels of appeal available . This needs to be explored with your state 's insurance office . You may also want to ask about a " private right of action " , which means the right to hire an attorney . Federal law currently mandates no internal or external appeal process for consumer protests , and there may be little you can do . How to hire a lawyer for an insurance problem If a careful investigation of the facts convinces you that you want to hire a lawyer , your nearest National MS Society chapter may be able to offer referrals . Many state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowcost legal help or sponsor legal aid societies . Law schools might offer no- or low-cost legal aid as well . Every state also has a trial lawyers association which can make referrals to attorneys who specialize in health insurance . Social Security programs As explained above , most people with disabilities become eligible for Medicare or Medicaid health insurance through being eligible for one of two Social Security income-maintenance programs : Social Security disability insurance ( SSDI ) or Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) . SSDI is based on work history and disability status and is available to people who can no longer work at a " substantial gainful level " but who were employed for most of their adult lives . The work history requirement is a bit complicated , but the rules are well explained in Social Security Administration pamphlets . Medicare coverage begins 24 months after the official eligibility for income benefits begins . SSI is based on financial need and disability status . The benefit payments are substantially lower than those of SSDI . Those eligible are low-income people , with limited assets , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or have other disabilities . Medicaid coverage begins according to the state 's regulation . Applying for Social Security programs Both SSDI and SSI application forms ask for a complete medical history . If adequate records are not provided , a person may be sent to a consulting physician for an examination , said Mel Tanzman , director of health policy for the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association . He warned that this exam might not be thorough enough to provide a complete picture of the health of a person with MS . A smart self-advocate will file a written statement from her or his physician detailing the MS-related disability . A good self-advocate will first explain to the physician that this statement should be guided by the 205-page " Blue Book " , Disability Evaluation Under Social Security ( SSA publication #64-039 ) . The most recent edition was published in January , 1998 . It contains the medical criteria Social Security uses to determine disability . It can be obtained by professionals free of charge from the SSA 's Office of Communication-by faxing 410-965-0696 or by writing to SSA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Social Security will also want an accurate work history-here come those documents again . It may also want to determine whether your education and knowledge levels are transferable to another type of employment . A shortcut through the jungle Getting these Social Security benefits-and the insurance coverage they bring-is n't easy . Only 36% of people who apply for SSA disability benefits are accepted on their first try . Statistics indicate that people who use a Social Security representative have a higher acceptance rate than those who do not , both on initial application and on appeal . There are 4 levels of official appeal . Representatives are paid on a contingency basis , and are only paid if you win your benefits . The fee is set at a certain maximum percentage of the retroactive benefits-the checks you would have received if you had not been denied . But the out-of-pocket costs will be your responsibility , whether you win or not . As a good consumer , have a frank talk about the costs before signing on the dotted line . Allsup , Inc. is a commercial firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some people advise getting representation before the application is submitted . If you have a good coach telling you what to say and how to say it , this theory goes , you maximize your chance of being approved on the first go round . The National Organization of Social Security Claimants ' Representatives ( 800431-2804 ; www.nosscr.org ) is a professional society whose members are attorneys specializing in Social Security law . They also work on a contingency basis and generally take only clients who are making a second appeal-at the Administrative Law Judge level-the ALJ hearing . More than half of all SSDI and SSI recipients ultimately receive benefits because they appealed to the ALl . The bottom line Wading through red tape is confusing , reading insurance contracts is not a day at the beach , and keeping detailed symptom diaries , work histories , and medical records can seem overwhelming . However , your time and trouble should pay off . You will be aware of the resources you can consult , and the planning you should do to best protect your money and your health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legal Rights Bookshelf Sidebar Sticking up for yourself may mean working with others Sidebar Important legislative action to improve health insurance is being done on the state level .

She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @               @x Darkness <p> <p> There were times on the island , late in the summer of 2027 , when I thought I could hear the sun hissing off the ground . It was the same noise that the insects made in the jungle , out there on our miserable little cluster of Pacific islands , misbegotten and nameless somewhere south of the Marshalls , and it pressed down on me like the dust that hung in the air and stained it yellow . <p> <p> But if I closed my eyes , I could imagine the noise was the sound of water , instead . On some days there was only the sun , hissing down on the islands and the ocean , but on the afternoon Sergeant Polaski was to arrive it was the sound of water , cool and clear in the shadows . I was standing on the rutted ground by the runway , remembering a picture I 'd seen of a river in Las Serranfas del Burro , when the cough of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> <p> It backfired again and throttled down over the jungle , then shuddered onto the dirt runway in a cloud of smoke . When it had rumbled by I closed my eyes again , unwilling to give up my thoughts to a man whose arrival would surely end what little peace I 'd found here . <p> <p> The plane turned and taxied back , then waited out in the sun with its engines idling . Minutes passed . <p> <p> " Torres . " <p> <p> I opened my eyes . The airplane shimmered in the heat while its crew wrestled a crate down a ramp into the dirt . <p> <p> When I turned in the direction of the voice I found myself looking into the barrel of a revolver , gripped in the hand of a short , blond man with a pale , unremarkable face and expressionless grey eyes . <p> <p> " Hello , Polaski . " <p> <p> He let down the hammer . " That 's not real bright , Torres , standing out in the dirt with your eyes closed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane . <p> <p> I hated Polaski . Hated him and loved him . I had n't seen him since 1st Engineers , where we 'd served together until the unit was disbanded . It was broken up after Polaski killed an officer with an anti- tank round  --  broken up mainly because the MPs could n't decide who 'd done it . Polaski himself fingered a half- breed Samoan named Tulafono for it ; it was the day after Tulafono had beaten me with a tire iron for swearing in Spanish . <p> <p> Polaski was kicked back to sergeant in a demolitions unit , but I 'd kept warrant officer and was sent to join the forward units in the Pacific . Now Polaski was here , too , evidently as part of an Army plan involving heavy demolitions . It was a plan I did n't like because I knew nothing about it , which was why I 'd picked Polaski up at the airstrip in the first place . That , and the hint of anticipation I 'd felt when I first heard he was coming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't yet understand . <p> <p> " What are they planning for these islands , Polaski ? " <p> <p> " Nothing you need to know about . " With a shriek from the brakes the plane jerked forward again , a wavering blob of silver in the heat , and left behind a cloud of smoke and the crate , dumped on the runway like the stool of a great bird . " It is n't going to work , anyway , " he said . <p> <p> The engines spun up and the plane bounced around over the ruts , then rose tiredly up over the jungle . <p> <p> " What is n't ? " <p> <p> Polaski did n't answer . <p> <p> " I heard we 're looking for someone , " I said . <p> <p> Still he did n't answer . I was almost wishing he 'd gone , too , leaving me to my thoughts of how to get out of the war , how to get away and find a place of my own . How to get off of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest named Katherine Chan ? " he said . <p> <p> " Yes . " <p> <p> " The crate 's for her . Let 's go , I 'm in a hurry . " <p> <p> Polaski and I had been picked up off the streets in Army sweeps at the age of fourteen , then sent to Technical Warfare School . For a country with too many immigrants , too little oil , and an aversion to drafting its own citizens , conscription as an alternative to deportation had become just another of the Army 's growing number of dirty secrets . The four-year Tech- War School , itself a secret and open only to the conscripts with the most potential , was designed to provide regular Army units with technologically sophisticated soldiers , able to fight in the Pacific with little support . <p> <p> Polaski called us the " Shorts " ; in addition to what ever the Army thought of as intelligence , it had picked us for endurance , and in the end that had meant squat and tough . So we were squat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment : Greater knowledge of the war had n't always brought the Army greater loyalty . <p> <p> " I need to see your captain , " said Polaski . He 'd taken over my truck by the runway , and now its electric motors hissed and spat as he ran down trees and rocks in the jungle . <p> <p> " We have n't got a captain , " I said <p> <p> " A lieutenant ? " <p> <p> " You need to see Bolton . " <p> <p> " Choppers ? " <p> <p> " No . We get them from Airmobile on the big island . " <p> <p> The jungle dropped away with a smack of high grass on the hood and a dry scraping sound as it dragged along underneath . We were in the big clearing by the beach , next to the helicopter pad and the mess canopy with its leaning , rusted poles . Scrub grass and rows of bungalows stretched away to the jungle on the far side . <p> <p> Polaski dropped me off and drove away to find Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a familiar furry streak raced in from the side toward the truck 's front wheels  --  McGafferty 's dog , low to the ground and barking for all he was worth . <p> <p> Polaski swerved sharply . But he swerved toward the dog , not away from it , as though hoping the dog would overshoot . But it was a miscalculation , and with a sound muted by the distance into a soft thumping , the dog 's body tumbled out from underneath the wheels and lay still in the dirt . Polaski kept going . <p> <p> " At least you could stop and look ! " <p> <p> I shouted at him again and looked for a rock to throw , but it was too late . He was gone across the clearing . <p> <p> The dog was dead . Its back and neck were broken and it bled from half a dozen wounds . I stroked its muzzle with the back of my hand and pulled out a rock that had lodged in its mouth with the broken teeth . I moved him away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> The air under the canopy was heavy and still , punctuated only by the wet sound of sunflower husks spat across the floor by Sergeant First Class Tyrone Elliot . He was leaning back in a chair with his feet up on the table , a tall , powerful Southerner with mild eyes and black stubble on his dark face . His jaw was broad and square with thick muscles bunching in his neck as he chewed . Deep lines ran from the corners of his eyes and down past his mouth , as though he 'd been tired for a long time . The hands on his knees were big and still . <p> <p> He did n't say anything for a while , but sat and chewed and watched the receding back of Polaski 's truck . <p> <p> " So your old buddy Polaski 's here , " he said finally . He rummaged in his pocket for more seeds . " So maybe we 'll forget to tell him about the water , what do you think ? " <p> <p> " Polaski 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . " <p> <p> " Uh- huh . " <p> <p> " He should have stopped , though . " <p> <p> " Uh- huh . " <p> <p> Elliot launched himself out of his seat to slam his hands together overhead , then just as suddenly sat back down and wiped them on his fatigues . " Polaski 's crazy , Torres . I been with him in the 89th . He ai n't all there , you know , and he do n't see you when he look at you . He 's mean , boy , and he 's crazy . You stay away from him . " <p> <p> " It 's the war that 's mean , Tyrone . " <p> <p> " Do n't stick up for him . " <p> <p> " It 's the war , Tyrone . The whole planet . It 's gotten so bad I do n't even know any more when I 'll wake up puking blood from some new wonder we 've dumped in the water . You saw what happened to the lieutenant . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another shell . " Anyhow , nothing we can do about it . Or you back to thinking about getting off ? " <p> <p> " Of course I 'm thinking about getting off . " <p> <p> Far off , I was thinking . Off- planet with someone like Katherine Chan , someone still in one piece . As far and as fast as an engine could carry us , away from the memories that followed me everywhere I went . Memories of Mexico and hunger , memories of boats filled with children and the stink of death . Broken dogs , broken children . Memories of the frozen pavement in Chicago , memories of my father hanging from the wires in the desert . . . <p> <p> " Uh- uh , no sir . " Elliot stuck another seed in his mouth . " Ai n't no one gotten off this old ball of trouble for a long time , except rich folks in their tin cans up there . U.S. quit on the space tunnel years ago , I keep telling you . And no one ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So that 's that . Rich folks is stuck in their cans , and you and me is stuck in 42nd Engineers digging out holes to piss in . So you take what you got , Torres , which is a fine afternoon and something to chew on . Here , have some . " <p> <p> I swatted at a fly . " What 's the Army planning for these islands , Tyrone ? Polaski wo n't say . " <p> <p> " You tell Polaski to piss off . Word I got is you 're the only one he pays any mind to , anyway . What 's happening on these islands is that Army and Air Force is going to try something funny on those skinny little atolls east of here , except folks is saying it ai n't going to work . " <p> <p> " Bolton says we 're looking for someone . " <p> <p> " Yeah , but that 's different . Been going on a long time . DoD 's looking for one of their smart- boys , went and slipped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BCs that 's going to save all our asses . He took ' em a year ago , and now Army 's saying he 's out here somewhere and we got to get him back before all this other big shit comes down . " <p> <p> Out here somewhere ? Out here was twenty- one barely- charted volcanic ridges and cinder cones off the shipping lanes and airways , which from above looked mostly like dried rabbit shit with green mold on it sticking out of the ocean . Before the war it had been a mecca for transoceanic racers , religious cults , and rich bastards on the outs with latest regime in Cambodia or the Philippines , but now there was almost no one . Out here was a hundred forty-seven half- dead , insect- ridden combat engineers who prayed every morning not to be noticed for one more day by the enemy or by our own battalion , eighty miles to the north on the island with the big air base . So why would someone hiding from the American military be out here ? Like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either really dumb or really smart . <p> <p> And we had to get him back before what came down ? Too much was happening  --  the Army poking around after leaving us alone for a year , heavy equipment for the MI priests suddenly showing up on our eighty pitiful acres of dead grass and rusting tin , talk about heavy demolitions . . . and now Polaski back . To do what I told him to ? Not likely . I was an Army hardware engineer , no more . I took care of the island 's machines , from the cooling rods in the big antennas to the drones we put up at night to listen in on the Japanese . I tuned them and I studied them , and I spent my nights alone with them and the sounds of the jungle , not wanting to sleep . And that was all . <p> <p> Polaski 's truck skidded to a stop in front of Bolton 's bungalow across the clearing . Smoke trailed from the motors . He strode through the grass and jumped onto Bolton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> <p> " Yup . " <p> <p> " Why would anyone steal the plans to counter- biologicals ? " <p> <p> He was quiet for a minute . <p> <p> " I been hearing a long time , " he said , " how you 're one of the real smart ones , Torres . I think maybe you got yourself a good question there . Japanese sure as hell do n't need to defend against their own shit , huh ? " <p> <p> " Why 's Polaski here , Tyrone ? " <p> <p> He shrugged . " Blow something up , I expect . It 's what he does . " <p> <p> Clouds scudded along the horizon over the ocean . I tried not to think about Polaski , and tried to remember the daydream he 'd interrupted , instead . <p> <p> There 'd been a time when missions to the stars had been planned by the western nations , out through America 's " space tunnel . " It was a moon- sized torus near Venus that was supposed to pass the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed and livestock embryos . The project had died from poverty and warfare , but it was those same trees and horses I 'd been thinking about that morning . Trees and horses and Katherine Chan , and a piece of land far from Earth and the war . All of it impossible . <p> <p> " Well , " said Elliot , " I guess I do n't know what demolition 's got to do with MI folks , after all , now that I think about it . But you might have noticed the priests had something to do with a bunch of sonic diggers out behind Bolton 's bungalow . " <p> <p> " Diggers ? " <p> <p> " Yup . Big suckers . " <p> <p> Torres . " Elliot 's voice , far away . The dog snarled and pushed its face in through the spokes of the wheel , in under the wagon where I 'd crawled . " Jesus Christ , boy , wake up . What the hell 's the matter with you , anyway ? " I was four , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot on my face . Its neck was bloody with open sores . Dogs behind it fought each other and tore at the entrails of an infant they 'd dragged away from its carreta , away from its sleeping parents in their tin and cardboard house . My mother and father were nowhere . The little girl 's unseeing face jerked in the dust and blood spattered under the wagon . Helpless men across the road shuffled their feet and threw rocks at the dogs . <p> <p> " Come on , Torres . " <p> <p> There was foam in the dog 's mouth , under its lip where it curled back from its teeth . <p> <p> " Shit , what 's the matter with this boy ? " <p> <p> Later that morning I sat with Polaski on the slope of an island to the east of the company camp , watching the glare of the sun from under my eyelids . It reflected off the straits between the island where we sat and a deserted peak rising from the ocean two miles away . I was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed my hands over my ears to keep out the roaring behind me . Two days had passed since Polaski 's arrival . <p> <p> The sound changed pitch again , then surged from the roar into a howl , setting my teeth on edge and sending new pain into my temples . It warbled lower for a moment only to seize on a new frequency and lash out again , tearing the air apart with its shriek and bringing a sweat to my forehead . <p> <p> On the island across the straits , angry jets of smoke tinged with purple shot into the air each time the digger found a frequency that worked , leaving behind a smoldering socket where tons of earth had been disintegrated . Now and then Polaski let the digger dip its massive barrel too far , and its beam swept across the ocean to send a wall of steam curling into the sky . It settled across us later in a cloud of humid air that mingled with our sweat and stung our eyes . <p> <p> Squatting on its thick legs behind us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its beam higher up the far island until it found a new weakness in the rock , then leapt into its screaming again . The clanging of its cooling pump was like the metallic thumping of a cat 's tail as it hurled itself into its kill . <p> <p> " God damn it , Polaski , turn that thing off ! " Having Polaski take potshots for fun was more than I could stand . The noise was like an alien presence inside me that stole my concentration and dragged me closer to a pit I needed all of my wits to stay out of . A pit I 'd slipped into that morning and stayed in until Elliot had finally kicked me awake . <p> <p> " Jesus Christ , boy ! " he 'd shouted . " Wake up ! " <p> <p> Foam in the dog 's mouth , the wagon collapsing with the dog 's head still caught in the spokes . . . <p> <p> " Torres ! " <p> <p> Polaski hit the switch in his lap . The digger choked in mid- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its disappointment . The armor on its haunches clattered , then with a hiss and a crump as the armature locked up , the machine was quiet and Polaski and I were left alone with the flies and the sun . <p> <p> On the blackened ruin of the island across the straits , gullies glowed red and ragged pits steamed along the waterline . I struggled to my feet and climbed the hillside to sit next to Polaski . <p> <p> " So aside from target practice , Polaski , how come you dragged me out here ? " <p> <p> He squinted at the pitted island with one eye closed , judging his work . <p> <p> " We have to take test shots once the surface warms up . " He squinted with the other eye . <p> <p> " It 's warm , " I said . Polaski had asked Bolton to have me assigned to him , but I did n't want to be there . <p> <p> " Another two hours , " he said . <p> <p> " Christ . " I lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondering what possible use the military could have for such a little island . Polaski lay back , too , then began lobbing rocks up over his head . He was trying for the clang when they hit the digger , but most of them thumped into the hillside and came skittering back down past us . I could n't see them after they left his hand , so after waiting for the clang I had to wait again to see if one would smack into me on the way down . Each time one found its target I thought he was going to stop , and when he did n't I wanted to snatch the rocks up and throw them back at him . . . <p> <p> Do n't . I sat up and looked at the ocean . There was another scene from Piedras Negras that came back sometimes , more often than I liked . Running from the stinging sand that blew across the desert , into the heat of our tiny house with its iron roof . Running toward my father where he sat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at the tabletop and not moving . My mother at the basin , her head turning with the warning in her eyes : Do n't . That 's what I remembered  --  her dark eyes turning toward me and their warning : Do n't . <p> <p> I let out my breath and ran a hand through my hair , then turned to look along the flank of the hill . Polaski was watching me . <p> <p> " Pretty little thing , " he said , " is n't she ? " <p> <p> " Who ? " <p> <p> " Miss Chan . " <p> <p> The image of Mexico faded . " You stay away from Chan . " <p> <p> " Really ? I was thinking maybe I could diddle her for you , Torres , tell you what it was like . " <p> <p> " I said leave her alone . " <p> <p> " Sweet on Miss Chan , are we ?

" He reached for a bigger rock . " Do n't go crapping out on me again , Torres . " <p> <p> " I did n't crap out on you . You fucked up and the Army busted us . " <p> <p> He toyed with the rock . " So what do you see in her , anyway ? " <p> <p> " Someone who 's still all right , Polaski . Someone whose insides have n't been taken out and pissed all over like the rest of us . " <p> <p> " Nice , " he said . " Nicely said . So what 's she see in you ? " <p> <p> I did n't answer . <p> <p> " Come on , Torres , I 've seen the way she looks at you all the fucking time . What 's she see in you ? " <p> <p> " I do n't know . Come on , Polaski , what did you drag me out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all right ? I need your brains . Is that what you want to hear ? " <p> <p> " For what ? " I said . <p> <p> He did n't answer . <p> <p> " For what ? " <p> <p> He rummaged in his pack . " You tell me . " <p> <p> " Forget it , Polaski . All I want any more is out . " <p> <p> He got his radio into his hand and called Tyrone Elliot ; he 'd seen El-liot 's heli cop ter beating its way toward us across the ocean , just above the waves . <p> <p> " Yes , boss , " said Elliot . <p> <p> " Make a detour , Elliot . Get Torres ' ass out of here . He needs something to do . " <p> <p> " Yes , sir , Herr Feld Marschall , sir . Tell him we 'll snap his little wetback ass off the ridge , sir . " The radio shut off with a squeal . <p> <p> " Get out of here , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Go back where you came from , maybe . " <p> <p> I stood up . " So what about you , Polaski ? Where did you come from ? " <p> <p> He was sitting a few yards away from me , facing down the hill , and now he put the radio down carefully between his feet . His movements were slow , calm . He looked down at the radio , then stayed that way , his head down , the muscles working in his jaw . <p> <p> It was what I 'd expected . The only other time I 'd asked him about himself was at the school , after we met , when I asked him if he had family , and his reaction was the same . His face lost expression and his eyes narrowed , and he did n't look at me or speak . He just walked away . When he returned three days later our relationship had changed : There were things that belonged in it , and things that did n't . <p> <p> I left Polaski stewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ridge , while I scratched at my bites and thought back to when I met him . <p> <p> I 'd been in the U.S. two years when the Army picked me up and selected me out for Tech- War School . Until then I 'd been working the reforestations in the summer and trying to stay warm in the winter , asking at doors for books and food and huddling under blankets at night to read them . I walked the streets during the day and tried to sound Anglo and think Anglo , trying to get out of the trap . In cities filled with poor I was the poorest , a wetback off the Gulf boats that snuck around the border wire , and I knew my only chance for a job was English and machines . <p> <p> Then without warning I was in the Army . Polaski appeared a few days later , as though out of nowhere . Streetwise and confident , quick on familiar ground and sly when out of his depth . He picked me out for my skill with the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though mindful of losing a new possession . The pointed guns began , the half- serious threats , always in private . <p> <p> The pounding of Elliot 's helicopter brought me back to the present . It kicked up a trail of fine sand along the ridge , then threw up a biting cloud as it reared above me . A black arm reached down from the after door and heaved me in , and Tyrone Elliot 's equally black face appeared as he snapped a tether onto my belt . I grabbed at it just as the helicopter spun and plunged down the far side of the ridge . Elliot grinned . <p> <p> " Getting on Polaski 's nerves , huh ? " <p> <p> " Nothing gets on Polaski 's nerves , Tyrone . " The cabin was packed with soldiers from Elliot 's platoon , including Specialist Ellen Tanaka , a tiny woman almost inseparable from him and currently clinging to the back of his belt as she peered out from the open door . <p> <p> " Who 's Bolton kissing up to to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airmobile kills quicker than giving up fuel . " <p> <p> " Oh , this ai n't Bolton . This here 's straight from Battalion , and it 's sure enough major business . Mighty peculiar , too . " <p> <p> " Why ? " <p> <p> " Well , what we 're doing here , see , is searching for civvies and yanking ' em up off the island , then hauling their asses back so the Army can see if we got the fellow they 're looking for . And we got ta jerk ' em out real quick like , so not one whisper of nothing gets off the island . " <p> <p> " Not one whisper of what ? " <p> <p> " You 're asking a man who do n't know , friend . I just work here , if you know what I mean . " He flashed another grin . " But I do hear that in thirty-six hours a whole lot of this here island ai n't gon na be here no more . " <p> <p> With that he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up above the beach with its nose toward the trees , kicking up sand . Elliot shouted into the cabin . <p> <p> " DeLauder ! Your sector ! Call in for pickups  --  go ! " Tess DeLauder and two others fought their way forward and dropped from the swaying machine , rifles smacking against the deck . <p> <p> " They need professional grunts to do this kind of work , Tyrone . " <p> <p> " No , sir . No one 's supposed to know that do n't have to . " <p> <p> " So why do we have to ? " A wall of hot sand slammed in through the door as the helicopter spun . <p> <p> " Lord almighty , boy ! Because what ever screwed up thing 's happening to this island , it 's us that 's doing the screwing ! Salvatore , you folks are next ! Let 's go ! " <p> <p> We went on around the island and dropped the rest of the crews , then ended up over the shoreline less than a mile from where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pi lot go around again when we saw roofs in the jungle and a satellite dish on the sand , tucked in against the tree line . He slapped the pi lot and pointed , and the three of us were dropped on the beach  --  Elliot , Ellen Tanaka , and me . The helicopter beat its way down the beach and off over the water , and the silence closed in with the droning of insects . <p> <p> Tanaka nodded toward the tree line . <p> <p> " What if there 're people in those houses ? " <p> <p> " Well , now , " said Elliot , " I suppose that 's the whole point . Torres , move it back along there and cut the leads to that dish , before someone starts telling someone else there 's choppers fooling around out here . Then let 's go on back in and see who it is might be doing the telling . " <p> <p> " Tyrone , " I said . " You do n't move islands in thirty- six hours . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Why son , we ai n't going to move nothing in thirty- six hours . We 're going to move it in five minutes . And we 're going to do it sitting right on top of it , too ! " <p> <p> " We 're going to blow this island while we 're on it ? " <p> <p> " Yes , indeed ! You 're gon na need faith , boy , faith . " <p> <p> " Why are we blowing it , Tyrone ? " <p> <p> He shrugged . " Shoot , Torres , details like that they ai n't telling us . Now get going . " <p> <p> I sawed through the cable leading from the dish into the underbrush . It was a small commercial device and nothing military , so we were probably dealing with civilian recluses or sportsmen . We were so close to the equator that the dish was pointed only slightly north , but it was pointing a fair bit east , probably at one of California 's big commercial machines . Someone was using it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs . <p> <p> Elliot and Tanaka had headed straight into the trees , and I cut into the jungle to meet them . I was struck by how quiet it was . No birds or crickets , no scurrying among the trees . Only the snapping of twigs and the crackle of dry leaves under my feet . The jungle was thin and brittle , close to burning . And it stank ; down at the waterline , rotting fish lay half out of the water . <p> <p> " Okey- doke , " said Elliot beside me , " let 's walk real quiet , like . " We pushed in through the underbrush until a bungalow appeared through the trees . Beyond it a rutted track climbed up to the dirt road , after which the hillside continued up to the island 's ridge . The tangle of jungle followed the slope up a way , then petered out into rock and shale . The door to the bungalow was open , and Elliot motioned me in . <p> <p> I peered into the gloom . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> " I do n't think we 're going to find anyone , " I said when I came back . " This place is too crummy for air-dropped supplies , and there 's not much of a town or boat dock anywhere close . " <p> <p> " Yeah . Maybe we got us a long- time- gone nut case retreat or something . " <p> <p> " Tyrone , " said Tanaka , " that was a pretty new McAllister dish on the beach . " <p> <p> " Yeah , true . Okay , here 's another one . " Tanaka and I waited among the trees while Elliot pushed open the door . <p> <p> " Nope . " <p> <p> I took the third bungalow . Its door was open like the others . I stepped onto the porch to look , but it was too dark to see in . Yet from the doorway came the steady purring of ventilating fans , and a current of warm air with an odd , sweet smell in it . I held up a hand for Elliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There was the luster of wooden floors and off to the side , a little up from the floor , tiny equipment lights . The familiar green lights of MI cabinets . On the wall behind them hung charts and drawings , while papers and books lay scattered on the tables . By the door stood a terminal with a cable hanging from it , most likely to the severed antenna on the beach . <p> <p> At the far end of the room , a man sat on a straight chair turned slightly away from me , at a table with books and a glowing screen . Small and elderly , he had the dusty yellow skin and fine features of the Vietnamese . He wore a rumpled black shirt and a soiled shawl over his shoulders . Limp , grey strands of hair clung to his scalp . <p> <p> A keyboard was pushed to one side , while instead he was using fast- typing gloves clamped to the table . The arms disappearing into them were thin , and the tendons stood out clearly even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulled up around his waist , while a bamboo cane hung from the back of his chair . He looked fragile , barely alive . A smoking pipe lay next to the screen , made from bone and brass . Tinny Asian pop music came from the back room . <p> <p> He was leaning forward with a kind of stiff intensity , the gloves shaking so hard that he had to be working very fast , although several times he gave an abrupt sigh and glanced toward the back . <p> <p> I knocked . <p> <p> His head whipped around , and in the same movement he seemed almost to lunge toward the screen . But his hands were caught in the gloves , and after that one , convulsive movement he remained frozen in that odd position , his eyes locked on mine . There was something he did n't want me to see , and from the expression that finally came over him after sitting there trapped by his own gloves for a minute , he knew that he himself had given this away . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his door , since anyone had driven down this road , walked up this beach ? His eyes finally lost focus and drifted to the floor . The tension went out of his shoulders and he slumped back into his chair , seemingly defeated by the mere appearance of an American soldier at his door . It was a strange performance in every way . <p> <p> Elliot put a hand on my shoulder . <p> <p> " We got ta go , Torres . " He squinted into the room , then craned his neck further into the shadows . " The fuck ? " He took another step in and looked around , then stepped back to the door in confusion . <p> <p> " You 're shitting me , " he said at last . " That 's him , ai n't it ? The one we 're supposed to be rounding up ? I thought this was all bullshit . " <p> <p> But I 'd already seen the titles on the books . <p> <p> " It 's not biologicals , Tyrone . " <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Listen , Torres , " he said finally . " Battalion 's screaming for my ass . We got ta do this and get out . " <p> <p> " Go away , Tyrone . " <p> <p> He stared at me . " Come on , Torres , get his ass out of here . What do you mean , ' go away ? ' You know this place is getting trashed tomorrow . " <p> <p> " I 'll take care of it , Tyrone . I 'll get out with Polaski . " <p> <p> Elliot ran the back of his hand across his mouth , looked uncertainly out through the open door , stared around the room one more time , then frowned at me as though he did n't recognize me . <p> <p> " Fine , Torres , fine . I do n't know what the fuck you 're doing , but fine , I ai n't been here . But you watch yourself , boy . " <p> <p> Then he was gone , and a minute later the helicopter pounded away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't moved . <p> <p> I walked along the tables and glanced again at the books . They were English- language texts in disciplines I scarcely understood , but whose significance I knew very well . <p> <p> None of the machines along the near side of the room , idling in their racks or cluttered on top of the tables , appeared to be connected to the outside world , or to the machine the man had in front of him . <p> <p> Next to the charts on the wall he 'd pinned a clump of photographs and articles . He was in some of the photographs himself , standing next to Westerners in what looked like academic settings . One photograph of him alone was partway down an article entitled DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY DISMISSES SCIENTIST 'S CLAIMS OF CHEAP POWER . <p> <p> I looked at the title for several minutes . I scarcely wanted to think what it implied . If the man had really found such a thing , it was worth any amount of money  --  yet according to the article , he had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> <p> I read the rest of the articles , keeping one eye on the man all the while . And as I read them , a mixture of anticipation and fear began to leave a sour taste in my mouth . Could it really be that no one had ever put all the pieces together ? <p> <p> On the other hand , maybe someone had . The military . Maybe their story about the missing researcher was n't all fabrication . Maybe the military had indeed put the pieces together , and had gotten to the man first . Then killed the story , courtesy of the Department of Energy . <p> <p> And if it was true , and he 'd then gotten away from them , even to this strange , scarcely settled island cleverly in the shadow of the equatorial Pacific war zone itself , he would n't really have been surprised to find the Army at his door . <p> <p> Me . <p> <p> Which makes it easier . I walked around behind his chair to the back room , and he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , though ? <p> <p> Or did I already know ? <p> <p> " Who 's here with you ? " I said . He continued to watch me , but did n't answer . <p> <p> The back room was smaller , with its own door to the outside , half open . On the floor were a sleeping mat and some personal items , including a battered radio playing the music and some faded girls ' clothing . <p> <p> I walked back to the table and leaned down to look at his screen . His eyes left mine to watch as I pulled the keyboard toward me , and his mouth opened with a hoarse sound of protest . His breath was strong with the half- sweet smell of opium . <p> <p> On the screen were mathematical series that meant little to me , so I reached for a key to flip through the pages of the document he was working on , finding the operating system and the editor he was using unfamiliar . I glanced at the corner of the screen to try and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else . <p> <p> Next to the page count was the machine 's free memory count . But what should have been a few hundred billion  --  a few hundred gigabytes , maybe terabytes  --  was instead shown exponentially in a way I 'd never seen before . <p> <p> 1.97 + 1015 . Two times ten to the fifteenth . <p> <p> Not hundreds of billions . Not trillions . Two quadrillion  --  a thousand times the memory of any workstation I 'd ever worked on . And I 'd worked on the best . The man 's eyes met mine . <p> <p> Without touching the keyboard I walked to the back of the table , around to the computer cabinet itself . To one side of it , a twenty- centimeter section of the power cord had been stripped of its insulation , and the three copper conductors inside it carefully strung between two small pedestals in plain view on the table , as though between tiny telephone poles . Other than that there were only old- fashioned , transparent fibers leading to the gloves and keyboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antennas  --  and nothing else . Nothing . Everything the man had was inside that one machine . He might have been mirroring his data among multiple memory stores inside the box to keep it safe , but it was n't leaving the machine . He had surrounded his computer with an air-gap and shielding , lest anyone hack his way in , intercept its signals , or add a tracer wire when he was n't there . <p> <p> I unfastened the clips and drew off the heavily shielded cover . The man said something and pulled himself out of his chair , but then slumped back down , quickly out of breath . <p> <p> In the center of the machine were two oblong , dull silver shapes side by side , about six inches long and two wide . They bore Department of Defense asset tags . I 'd heard rumors about such blocks , but I 'd never seen any . They were petabyte memory blocks , one quadrillion bytes each , two to the fiftieth power , all of it static , immune to accidental loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed a fraction of that memory , but what ever he was writing about must have . It was an amount of memory used to solve the mysterious equations of chaos , or to simulate the interactions of ge ne tics or particle physics . The blocks would have cost millions each . <p> <p> Blood was pounding in my ears as I walked back to the screen and began scrolling through the pages . Many of them seemed to deal with the rotation of super-symmetrical particles , the eerie fringe of quantum physics that had caught my attention in the book titles . <p> <p> Somewhat more familiar engineering work followed . One page was titled SUMMARY DATA : OUTPUT IMPEDANCE . It dealt with the production of electrical power , and the numbers were very low . He was dealing with something that put out a tremendous amount of power , like a power plant generator . <p> <p> Much farther down , a section was titled CRITICAL THERMAL THRESHOLDS AND WORKABLE MASS , and there , once I understood it , I stopped . It was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few kilograms . The size of a car battery . It had to be some kind of pulsing device , then , because anything so small could only put out that kind of power for a few thousandths of a second . <p> <p> The man was staring into his screen now along with me , at the same time tamping down his pipe absently with a finger . <p> <p> The last page was titled OBSERVED SUSTAINABILITY , and had only a few sentences . But I stared at the words in those sentences for a long time . Over and over I looked at them , not believing . <p> <p> Decades . Not thousandths of a second , but decades . The man was looking directly at me now , his face an awful conflict of what I took to be both pride and pain . <p> <p> I walked away , reeling . A device like the one spelled out in those blocks would give the world the kind of power people were literally dying for . Was it really possible ? <p> <p> " Observed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtual observation in the blocks ? Still , it would have been enough . Power  --  and with it , freedom . <p> <p> Iwas standing next to the computer 's cabinet when I looked up again sometime later , facing the man across the table . The evening had left the room gloomy and dim , his face lit only by the screen . He 'd lit his pipe when I 'd first walked away , and his head was wreathed now in amber smoke that drifted through the glow between us , obscuring his features . <p> <p> How long had I been pacing ? Back and forth I 'd gone past the clippings on the wall , past the now- darkened doorway , past the smoke and the keyboard , one eye always on the man and his hands , on the computer laid bare , on the silver blocks lying exposed in its middle like a beating double heart in an open chest . How many times had I remembered my father 's hands clutching his chipped and dirty glass , and how many times had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an engine of bone- crushing power hurling me upward and away from it all ? How many times had I wondered where this invention had really come from , only to tell myself that it surely was n't from this one , wretched man , that he himself , hidden away here with what ever guilty secret it was , could not possibly have had any intention of sharing it with the rest of a world so desperately in need . <p> <p> My hand rested on one of the blocks . I ran my thumb down one side of it and my fingers down the other , feeling for the flange on the bottom . Do n't . There was a throbbing in my ears , a roaring sound . Do n't speak . The man sat in his smoky world of half- light and watched my hand . The block slid upward in its socket . <p> <p> Do n't ask . A pair of dark eyes flashing their warning . Do n't want . I slipped the first block into my trousers pocket . The cloth lining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I 'd expected . The second block slid loose from its case . The man became agitated for a moment and pent up frustration seemed to pull at his features , but the opium soon took back its hold and left in its place only the moist , unfocused eyes , leaden already with resignation and the torpor of the drug . The block slipped free and the screen blinked out , leaving only a shadow in the gloom where he had sat , a memory fading away already into the night . <p> <p> I do n't remember finding my way back to Polaski 's and my little two- man camp that night , but I do remember walking along the hillside above the jungle , smelling the hot air and the dust , and thinking I could hear someone playing a flute far off in the distance . The tune was familiar , but difficult to hear . <p> <p> By the time I reached camp , though , the music was gone . Polaski was gone , too , leaving me just a sleeping bag and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bag and looked up into night , thinking that maybe my future lay out in the darkness , after all . A future bought with a single , quick , mean- spirited theft . <p> <p> Just before falling asleep I remember thinking it would be good to hear the flute again . It remained quiet , though , and I reached down for the touch of the blocks instead . <p> <p> I dreamed that night about a wolf . It walked toward me across a black planet at night , the color of ashes , its face smooth . And it had no eyes . <p> <p> Excerpted from A Grey Moon Over China by Thomas A. Day .
