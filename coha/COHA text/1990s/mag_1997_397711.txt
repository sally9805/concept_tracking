The rapid rise in popularity of super-sidecut , or shaped , skis has also given rise to speculation among experts in the field of ski injury . Are skiers more ( or less ) likely to hurt themselves on super-sidecuts ? The key word at this point is speculation . The experts agree that it will probably be at least two years before there 's enough hard evidence to draw any meaningful conclusions . More confounding yet , so many different designs exist among shaped skis that it may be difficult to make any generalizations about supersidecuts as a single category . " Everything is still theoretical , " cautions Dr. Robert Hintermeister , director of the Rehabilitation and Human Performance Laboratory at the Steadman Hawkins Sports Medicine Foundation in Vail . However , Hintermeister suspects that super-sidecuts may actually lessen the chance of some injuries . For starters , most skiers use shorter lengths when on super-sidecuts , and shorter skis are generally more maneuverable . The extra width of super-sidecuts , which provides added flotation in powder , also improves maneuverability . And the skis ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to potentially twist the leg during a fall . Most super-sidecuts also allow skiers to achieve a more balanced position . " The skis are more sensitive , so you do n't need to move as far forward or backward to work the tip and tail , " says Hintermeister . " If you can ski in a more balanced position , you 're less likely to fall . " Finally , because these skis turn easier , skiers ( especially those at lower skill levels ) may experience less fatigue , which might also mean fewer falls . Falling , of course , can cause injury . Presumably , if people fall less , they will be less likely to get hurt . Not necessarily so , according to Hintermeister . " Based on the design of the ski , if it 's on edge and weighted when you 're falling , it 's going to keep turning , " he says . This , he worries , may put extra rotational stress on the knee . The implication : You may be less likely to fall on super-sidecuts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of knee injury . Dr. Robert Johnson , professor of orthopedics at the University of Vermont , agrees . He worries that super-sidecuts may " continue to carve when you 're out of control , and the skier wo n't be able to deal with it . " Johnson says he is particularly concerned about injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) of the knee and that beginner skiers , who are generally in less control of their skis , may be at greater risk of injury in general and of tearing the ACL in particular . " There might be an argument that because beginners fall more , they 're more likely to get hurt , " says Johnson . It might not be so simple , however . In a preliminary study conducted by Johnson , Dr. Jasper Shealy of the Rochester Institute of Technology , and Carl Ettlinger of Vermont Safety Research , lessskilled skiers showed a lower rate of injury on super-sidecuts than would have been expected , considering that , based on previous research , they show a greater risk of injury on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly higher propensity for injury on shaped skis than on traditional skis . Photograph Shaped skis will likely mae injury patter in skiing For bet or worse , it 's too early to say . // Ettlinger cautions that it is far too early to make conclusions based on the study : at this point , the results can not be considered statistically significant . The finding does , however , segue smoothly into one of Ettlinger 's pet peeves : Skiers have not been receiving sufficient guidance in the use of these skis . Advanced skiers , who are generally less likely to take lessons or enter orientation programs , he says , are more apt to use the skis with improper technique ( such as oversteering ) and thus increase their level of risk . Another study suggests that supersidecuts do not increase stress on the knee , at least in normal skiing maneuvers . Rick Greenwald , director of the Orthopedic Biomechanics Institute in Salt Lake City , has begun researching the biomechanics of the knee in skiers on super-sidecuts , using a portable electromagnetic tracking system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rate of change of motion " of skiers on traditionally shaped skis and skis with extreme sidecut , Greenwald found " no reason to suspect that supersidecuts will lead to a higher propensity for injury . " However , he cautions , his study was limited to five expert skiers ( there are plans to add more skiers , including skiers at lower ability levels , and a greater variety of terrain ) , and the results have not yet been fully evaluated . Emergency stopping is an area of particular concern to Ettlinger and Johnson . While traditionally shaped skis slide like windshield wipers through a hockey-stop maneuver , carving skis , they contend , are more apt to just continue carving instead of sliding . " While turning is enhanced , " says Ettlinger , " panic stops require training and practice to be performed on these skis . " So , it 's possible that some added risk might be built into the design . But does this make super-sidecuts inherently riskier than traditionally shaped skis ? Not necessarily , say the experts . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet proven themselves to be any more or less safe than conventional skis . Says Ettlinger , " If there were anything terrible , we would have seen it by now . " In fact , he goes on to say , " I 'm hopeful that the technique associated with these skis more squared stance , less rotational movement has the potential to reduce injuries overall and knee injuries in particular .
