<p> You 've never met a more likable person than John Andrews , Carl Brahe says . Visiting Andrews at his loft above the Wynkoop Brewpub or at his job at a LoDo real-estate developer once meant finding him surrounded by friends hanging on his every word . <p> Then , in 1993 , Andrews grew ill with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , the disabling neurological illness known as Lou Gehrig 's disease . ' When he started losing his speech , they started disappearing , ' Brahe says . ' When he could n't talk or walk , it scared them so much they ran away . ' <p> Brahe , a psychotherapist , ' energetic healer ' and author who had long worked for Andrews , helped care for his friend , volunteering as much as 20 hours a week . <p> He and Andrews ' nurse , Victoria Hall , fell in love , bought a house in Bailey in the mountains 60 miles from Denver , and moved Andrews in with them 21/2 years ago . He lies in a hospital bed on their ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his skin waxy and pale , his lungs inflated and deflated by a ventilator , surrounded by medical supplies and New Age music . He has no muscle function ; he ca n't even move his eyes . <p> But Brahe and Hall insist their friend is still there - still conscious but ' locked in ' - and they searched in vain for a device that would let him communicate . There were plenty of electrical switches on the market that could be turned on and off with tiny muscular input , such as a nudge of the chin or a flick of the eye , but none that would benefit Andrews . <p> ' We talked to the experts , and they said there 's nothing we could do , give up , ' Brahe says . ' We said no . ' <p> Brahe hooked up by e-mail with Hidenori Ohnishi , a Japanese inventor whose seven-person electronics company , Technos Japan Ltd. , had created something called the Mind Controlled Tool Operating System . Ohnishi said that with MCTOS , a completely disabled person can turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , operate a computer . <p> Ohnishi visited Brahe and Hall in March . They tested the unit on Andrews and several other local disabled people . Even though Ohnishi barely speaks English , offered little information on Technos ' history and had no scientific data on how MCTOS was supposed to work , Brahe was impressed and went into business with him . <p> Technos America , owned 80 percent by Ohnishi and 20 percent by Brahe , now markets MCTOS in North and South America . Slogan : ' It 's the thought that counts and controls . ' <p> So far , they 've sold four of the $ 2,495 units . They 're also soliciting donations for a fund to buy MCTOS units for people who ca n't afford them . <p> One unit went to Pam and John Miller , also of Bailey , whose daughter Roni , 61/2 , stopped communicating four years ago as a result of metachromatic leukodystrophy , a lack of white brain matter . <p> ' She 's now learning , is responsive and happier , ' Pam Miller says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roni tells her what she 's looking at by selecting the right word on a computer . <p> ' She 's learning her letters now , ' Miller says . ' She already knows her shapes , colors and numbers . She can answer yes or no . ' <p> The MCTOS unit is a gray box with flashing red , yellow and green lights on the top and computer cable connections in back . It does n't differ in any important way from any electrical switch , Brahe says . It 's the headband that leads into the box that 's key , he says , because it can read and distinguish between alpha waves - the kind of brain waves that dominate when we 're relaxed - and beta waves , those that dominate when we 're agitated . These are the same signals read by the electroencephalograph , or EEG , a tool commonly used by neurologists to measure brain waves to study , for example , seizure activity . <p> If a person can learn to consciously manipulate his alpha and beta waves , then the MCTOS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' off ' signals , Brahe says . This can be done , he says , by thinking pleasant and unpleasant thoughts - for example , imagining you 're driving down a country lane , then being stopped by a cop . <p> Andrews has learned how to do this , Brahe and Hall say . <p> A recent attempt to interview Andrews in Brahe 's and Hall 's home was , to a visiting reporter and photographer , however , inconclusive . Brahe strapped the MCTOS headband on Andrews ' head and asked , ' Is it OK to take your picture ? ' A moment later there was a beep , which Brahe says meant yes . ' Tell us how you 're feeling , ' Brahe says . A cursor on a Macintosh computer jumped to , ' Great , just great , ' and the computer sounded the words . <p> But the outputs became increasingly random . ' His brain waves are very weak today , ' Brahe said . ' You 're quite fatigued , are n't you ? ' he says to Andrews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reporter and photographer themselves were equally unpersuasive . Even at a setting that , Brahe says , should have been totally impervious to physical pressure - responding only to brain waves - the switch was easily set off by wrinkling the forehead or pushing the headband with a finger . ( Brahe later said he 'd been back in touch with Ohnishi , who told him there is no brain wave-only setting ; even at the setting most receptive to brain waves , the unit will still respond to physical input , if there is any . ) <p> Brahe 's devotion to Andrews and other severely disabled people is undeniable , but is there any science behind MCTOS ? Brahe provides no references to any scientific research in Technos ' brochure or Web site . ' I know nothing about electronics , ' Brahe concedes , and when asked what 's inside the MCTOS headband , he replied , ' I 'm not sure . I think it 's a radio receiver . ' <p> Experts contacted by The Denver Post were divided . <p> ' It seems pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center ; EEG results ca n't be consciously manipulated , he says . <p> Dr. William Landau , a neurologist at Washington University School of Medicine , called Technos ' claims ' quackery , ' ' science fiction ' and ' crooked business . ' Even writing a newspaper article about MCTOS is unethical , Landau says , because ' hopeless people ' will read it and be falsely encouraged . <p> On the other hand , Joel Lubar , a professor of psychology at the University of Tennessee , said Brahe 's claims are based on a 30-year-old concept called biofeedback , which has been used , among other things , to teach children with attention deficit disorder to calm themselves . ' The idea of being able to help people who are incapable of communicating using simple devices in their home using their EEG is very reasonable , ' Lubar says . ' I think there will be much more of it in the future as the electronics get better . ' <p> Dr. Jonathan R. Wolpaw of the Wadsworth Center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be used to communicate - he teaches patients to do it at his lab in Albany , as do researchers at several other labs around the world - but that MCTOS might not be sophisticated enough . <p> ' If you record electrical activity from the forehead , you could be recording brain waves , muscle activity , eye-blink activity , ' Wolpaw says . ' If they 're using something other than brain-wave activity , that 's fine , if it helps people . But to make the assertion that you 're using brain-wave activity you have to have done some very careful studies , and I do n't know that they 've done that . They 're not saying . ' <p> Beyond the science lies the heart-rending philosophical question that dominates the relationship of any caretaker to a ' locked-in ' loved one : Does the MCTOS help ? <p> Does the device actually register Andrews ' wishes , or does it give Brahe and Hall an opportunity to project their wishes onto a body that no longer houses a mind ? <p> ' One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , ' Do you still find joy in living ? ' and he said yes , ' Hall says . ' We asked him again to be sure and he said yes . For us it 's all been about his personal choice . '
