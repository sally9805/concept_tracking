Click into these skis for all-mountain exploration made easy . // THE COLORADO TEST WAS a variety show in four acts . The cast was a mixed lot : SKIING editors , ski instructors , ordinary folks who ski only on weekends , locals at Copper and Winter Park who ski virtually every day . The skis were built for intermediate to advanced skiers who want to ski it all-but at their own pace- and who want the sport to be easy and fun no matter what the situation . Curtain up ! Act 1 : Copper Mountain . Hardpacked snow with a few inches of fluff in wind-protected pockets . Gray sky spitting snow . One by one , the testers drop into Spaulding Bowl , working the skis through sections of bumps and smooth steeps . Then they ski down onto Cross Cut , a 1,400vertical-foot groomed expressway where they can loosen the reins and feel the wind in their faces . Then it 's back up the Resolution chair to fill out a card , switch skis , and ride the Storm King poma to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an actionpacked supercircuit , and some testers do it as many as 15 times . Act 2 : Copper Mountain . Powder ! Over half a foot on the ground and it 's still falling . In a mad rush to get it while it lasts , the testers fly down Mine Dump and Murphy 's Law , two easy black-diamond trails off the E chair that are protected from wind and surprisingly light on traffic . Fifteen runs or more . Looking for the uncut . Blasting through the cut-up . A test of flotation and forgiveness , of aerobic fitness and quad strength . A day of sweat and grins . Trying desperately to write on test cards on the chair while golf-ball-sized flakes pour from the sky .

Seven minutes of Zephyr Express swiftness , and then it 's groomed greatness and mogul mania . Round and round the testers go , choosing their routes , looking for the best balance between challenge and energy conservation . Some make sweeping arcs on Upper Hughes , then dive into the medium-sized bumps on Mulligan 's Mile . Others go for the half-groomed , halfbumped Bradley 's Bash . The sun beats down , and by midafternoon the snow is close to goo . Quit early ? Not while the arcing 's this good . Act 4 : Winter Park . Another bluebird day . But it was cold enough overnight to quick-freeze the moguls . The buffed edges of the test skis make skritching sounds on frozen snow , so the testers follow the sun to find the softest conditions . By 11:00 it turns to glorious corn . But the routine never varies : up and down , filling out cards , adjusting bindings , working the skis . Take a bow .
