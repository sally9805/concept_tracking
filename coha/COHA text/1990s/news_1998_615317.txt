<p> It has taken me five years to write this story . How easily I have chronicled the pain of others , telling of murders , missing children , a one-legged Amish dairy farmer who used his milking stool to keep his balance . <p> In 16 years of writing a newspaper column , I selectively revealed myself on the installment plan ; I reckoned that to be a columnist 's main job . But I never have mentioned a pre-dawn five years ago . <p> I did not tell about watching through shadowy darkness as a man I loved put a gun to his head , cursed me , then pulled the trigger . I did not tell about that . Or about how he did n't die right away , but bled for hours into a stainless box attached to an emergency room table , his eyes wide open , his brain dead , his hands bagged to preserve the gunpowder . I could not describe that . <p> Barry Finch was a small-town Mississippi lawyer . He had inherited his Iuka practice from his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He was a hard worker and scrupulously honest . He gave away as much legal advice as he sold . It pained him to charge friends , widows , any elderly person , the unemployed . I have seen him close a real estate deal for the promise of a lunch , work a divorce for a new shirt . He never got rich . <p> He was known in his hometown for old-fashioned manners , killer charm and , believe it or not , a sunny disposition . Barry would rise whenever a woman , young or old , entered the room , bow from the waist , then notice some small detail about her and use it to embroider the most extraordinary compliment . In counseling his clients , he would fashion solution and compromise from seemingly hopeless situations . He was the life of parties . <p> There was , of course , a dark side to this moon . He drank too much , and when he drank he changed . By the time I met him , he had had two wives , two children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health problems , including a minor stroke . The same year of the stroke , he resigned from the public board he had represented for years because he believed it had acted illegally , circumventing the bidding process . Quitting meant he lost his state pension and health insurance . <p> Barry was depressed  --  and involved in an elaborate , energy-sapping effort to hide it . Over the years , he had mentioned suicide to a number of close friends . But he never sought counseling or medication , for that was something a weak man might do . <p> Many of us should have been prepared for his end . But nobody was . <p> One day in his last spring , Barry helped me plant 25 pounds of poppy seeds in a pasture next to my Iuka home . We mixed the seeds with wet sand , according to directions . Then he drove his old truck slowly in concentric circles while I sat on the tailgate and threw out my crop . <p> It was our last good day . <p> Since Barry 's death , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause , and a single culprit , when suicide occurs . They can not accept what the experts know , that death by suicide is not unlike a death by cancer . Depression grows , and eventually , untreated , it can kill . <p> But logic is never romantic . It is not the stuff of song or literature . So people in our town made up their own stories . One had him losing his " fortune " at the Biloxi gambling tables . The most popular and oft-repeated fabrications , of course , involved me . <p> Despite years of havoc in his personal life , the suicide happened on my watch . The week of his death , I had announced I was ending our tumultuous relationship . I meant it , and he knew it . The day of his death , I left town for the Mississippi coast . He followed . <p> People who kill themselves must argue their saner selves down , up until the last second . It has to be a ferocious battle . I suspect the eight-hour drive from north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barry . He wore his seat belt . He drank . He stopped to see a friend in Tupelo . He drank and drove some more . <p> It must be utterly exhausting to balance on the edge , to consider as perfectly equal choices life and death . In the last few days of his life , Barry had a root canal . He worked 10-hour days . He mowed a pasture . In essence , he pretended  --  perhaps even hoped  --  that he would be around to care about his teeth , his law practice , the summer grass . <p> I drove back to north Mississippi the day before his funeral . I wrote the obituary , but many did n't want me at the service . So I sat alone on my front porch and waited , though I did n't know what for . An inertia had set in that would last for months . I can count on one hand the people who came by , or dropped a card . His sister and brother were kind , and his retired longtime secretary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and also the score , did n't shun me , but it made them sad to visit . Most who had known him only casually felt obliged to pin blame . <p> I accepted my role as pariah ; it felt better than having no role at all . Going to the post office , or to a local cafe , was an ordeal . I made myself go . People who spoke to me did not mention Barry 's death . There was shame , and I was a part of it . <p> A few months later , Vincent Foster killed himself . Immediately , some decided it was a murder . I began to see something in human nature I 'd never noticed . With every suicide , a few cry , " Murder ! " It is inevitable . And to have a murder , there must be a murderer . Almost every month in the news , there is a celebrity suicide , and the reaction always is tabloid-worthy . Most recently , it was a former Oak Ridge Boy , Steve Sanders . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Globe teased . <p> I became perversely attracted to stories about suicide . I always hoped the survivors did n't live in a small town , where the stigma remains almost universal . I hoped they would hang tough . <p> I plowed through the grief and guilt and pain with the help of new friends , mostly . I took a new job , moved from Mississippi and , eventually , slowly , stopped taking the suicide so personally . Barry had made the decision to die , and , in a rage , involved me . <p> In talking to other people about other suicides , the obvious finally became clear . There is nothing to hide . There was a death , a tragedy , but there is no shame . Not for Barry , who was ill . Not for me . Honesty is the best policy for preventing other needless deaths . <p> From the thousands of seeds we planted that spring , only one poppy bloomed . I had forgotten about the flowers , to tell the truth . But one morning a solitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little white house . I 'm not sure what happened to all the rest . <p> But I remember finding meaning in the solo poppy , because grief , if nothing else , makes a body more contemplative . There are a million ways to die . It is much , much harder to live .
