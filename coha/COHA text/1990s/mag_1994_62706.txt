" What makes Toronto tick ? " asked the TV announcer . " What makes Toronto dead ? " Maurice ( the Rocket ) Richard asked back . Richard , who has played right wing for the Club de Hockey Canadien Inc. every winter since 1942 , sat , his shoes off , in a dark room in the Royal York hotel , laughing at Red Skelton and smoking a cigar  --  a burly man of 38 with an erect carriage , tilted , somber , devout face , inflexible eye , abundant black hair which also thickly mats his chest and back , making him look like a mangy bear , and queer , thin , knobby legs . " If he had another hair on his back , he 'd be up a tree , " says Kenny Reardon , who is vice president of the Montreal Canadiens . Richard 's roommate in Toronto , Marcel Bonin , who once wrestled a toothless , suffering bear in a carnival ( " I never win , " he admits ) was out somewhere in the cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roisterous marches up and down the long , dim hotel corridors , X 's on the backs of their red necks and violent apocalypses on their neckties . One of them hammered on Richard 's door . // " Go to bed , damn it ! " Richard shouted . " That 's my whole life trouble , " he said , " trying to sleep . My mother was the same way . If I sleep four or five hours a night , it 's good . TV puts me to sleep every time . Where would we be without TV , eh ? // " Eighteen years of this , " he said . " In the town . Out of the town . I really get tired of all these trips . " He got up and closed the transom , shutting out the racket . " People bother me , " he said . " The young ones , they 're all right .

" // And no one , certainly , will ever be quite like Maurice Richard , who next week , as their captain , leads the Canadiens toward their fifth consecutive Stanley Cup . Not even himself . " You should have come up five years ago , " he had said in the men 's room of a Montreal-Detroit sleeper several days before , where he has sat so many nights reading until the porter fills the room with hockey players ' shoes . " It 's getting to be my time now . I 'm getting near the end . I have had some good times , some bad . I started out with three bad injuries fractured left ankle , left wrist , right ankle and am ending with three bad injuries sliced Achilles tendon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old days are gone . These are the new days . I 'll never score five goals in one night . " He looked out the window at the dismal , glaring snow , listening to the wheels as the train bore him to his 1,091st game . Behind him , the glorious past , the records : 50 goals ( and in a 50-game season ) ; five goals in a playoff game ; 18 game-winning goals in 14 playoff series , six of which were in overtime ; 26 hat tricks ; 618 goals ; 1,076 points ; at least one goal in nine straight games ; etc. // " He was a wartime hockey player , " says Frank J. Selke , the 66-year-old managing director of the Canadiens . " When the boys came back , they said they 'd look after Maurice . Nobody looked after Maurice . He looked after himself . When the boys came back , they said they 'd catch up with him . The only thing that 's caught up with Maurice is time . " // " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are kids , " Richard said one night in a Detroit bar that advertised a stereophonic jukebox . " I know I 'm not playing good hockey now . I 'm weak now . My legs are tired . After a minute and a half , I 'm tired . I will try to diet . I weigh 194 pounds . I got to take off five or six pounds before the playoffs . Only one beer . That 's all I 'll drink . I 'll drink gin . That is n't fattening . " // He watched on TV a tape of the game he had played in an hour earlier . He had scored two goals . The bartender got in front of the TV while he scored the first goal , and Richard did not see it . He was told he had been chosen the game 's best player . " Me ? " he said . " I do n't believe it . I did not deserve it . Luck . " // " He kids himself that if he 's feeling well , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't feel well at the right weight . You 're crabby . But he makes so much money ! . He 's wonderful to sign . ' How much do you want ? ' I ask . ' How much do you want to give me ? ' he says . I always give him a little more than anyone else I hear about through the grapevine . He has done so much for the game . " // Richard 's annual income has been estimated at $60,000  --  half of it from his contract with the Canadiens  --  his total worth at $300,000 . He is a public relations man for Dow Brewery and Quebec Natural Gas , has part interest in a store that sells gas appliances , has bought a tavern that he is calling No. 9 after his uniform number and referees professional wrestling matches .

I would n't sign him for another year . I would n't let him make a fool of himself in front of a crowd . " Richard had played ineptly the night before , and Selke , like a proud , rigorous , loving father , spoke not in intemperate anger but with old , gruff affection , hurt by loss and memory . If his Maurice wanted to play next year , he would probably relent. // " If I play bad , " Richard says , " people will talk . I like to leave the game before people criticize me , boo me .

" // " He used to be a whirlwind , " says Gordie Howe of the Detroit Red Wings . " Now he 's just a whirlwind half the time . But when he 's not doing a lot , you notice it . Not like the others . " // " I 'm a little too old to be called Rocket , " says Richard . // " I first saw him in 1942 , " says Reardon . " I was playing for an Army team .

' " // " When he 's worked up , " says Selke , " his eyes gleam like headlights . Not a glow , but a piercing intensity . Goalies have said he 's like a motorcar coming on you at night . He is terrifying . He is the greatest hockey player that ever lived . I can contradict myself by saying that 10 or 15 do the mechanics better . But it 's results that count . Others play well , build up , eventually get a goal . He is like lightning . It 's a fine summer day , suddenly .... " // " Holy Dirty Dora ! " says Montreal coach Toe Blake .

" // " In all my experience in athletics , academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 've never seen a man so completely dedicated to the degree he is . Many people who prosper take prosperity for granted . He does n't to this day . He is the best hockey player he can be every second . You know , he is the eldest of a fairly extensive family raised in relative poverty . Somehow or other , he was going to lift himself . He has an inner urge to transcend. " // " He is not the Pope , " says Camil Des Roches , the Canadiens ' publicity man , wistfully . // " He is God , " says Selke. // Richard is regarded in Canada as no athlete is in the United States . He is not only a sports idol , he is the national idol , particularly among the French-speaking people of Montreal and the province of Quebec . When Maurice Richard scores a goal in the Forum , even an insignificant goal in a meaningless game , it touches off a unique celebration . First , an astonishing , prolonged din of cheering and applause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown onto the ice . Richard skates in abstracted , embarrassed , lonely circles through the heavy snow of objects . The game has to be stopped until the attendants clear the ice . But adulation sits on him like an uneasy crown . // " Nothing goes to my head , " he says . " I do n't think I deserve it . That 's my whole trouble all the years . There are better hockey players , but they do n't work as hard . I like to win . " // " We were playing Toronto once in a benefit Softball game , " Selke says . " Instead of just using the Maple Leaf players , they used the best softball players they had in their entire organization . They were beating us 25-5 . Maurice was playing third base . Someone laughed about the score . ' You might think it 's funny getting licked 25-5 in front of 14,000 spectators , ' Maurice said to him . ' I do n't think it 's a bit funny . ' " // " I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " making a farce out of something . I do n't like to lose . I like to meet people , but not to talk about hockey when we had a bad game and lost . I stay away from everybody and go home . But I 'm afraid to let the French people down . That 's why I 'm worried . I do n't want to be kept on the ice through sympathy . " // " He is more important than the cardinal or Duplessis , " explains one fan . " There are many cardinals . Duplessis was only the head man of Quebec . Maurice Richard was not only the best of the French but of the English as well . He came to epitomize the desire of superiority of the French Canadian nationalists . He was one of their best expressions . But you must understand that he has no personal interest in that . Maurice Richard never did a thing to accentuate it . He was a person to fix their eyes . Here was a demonstration . " // While an idol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He fought a lot on the ice , violently and well , although the sight of blood makes him ill . " I see myself bleeding or anyone else bleeding , " he says , " I feel funny . Once I cut my hand as a little kid and I passed out . " In 1955 , after a series of incidents culminating in the slugging of a linesman , Campbell suspended him for the last three regular-season games and the playoffs . That decision caused the notorious Forum riot and inspired a ballad to the tune of Abdul Abulbul Amir : // Now our town has lost face And our team is disgraced , But these hotheaded actions ca n't mar Or cast any shame on the heroic name Of Maurice ( the Rocket ) Richard . // Richard has also been called aloof , sullen , moody , uncommunicative , tight . " I 'm unpredictable , " says Richard , cheerfully . // " His difficulty was the language barrier , a very modest formal education and the disparagement of no war service , " the fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Somewhere at the back of his mind , " says Selke , " there is a feeling that someone is trying to put it over on him . He has a tremendous dread of poverty . " // " You can say that again , " Richard says , laughing . // " You can say a lot of things to Maurice , " Selke says , " but you got to be careful of your adjectives . Maurice just ca n't take anything . But there is no meanness in Maurice Richard . He 's 100 percent solid gold ; someone you 'd be proud to have as the husband of one of your daughters ; faithful , devoted . " // " For 15 years he 's been a law unto himself , " Reardon says . " He has been so good he did n't have to do the things others did . The time has n't come when he realizes he 's human and has to do the things everyone else does . But if he was n't so obstinate , he could n't have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched , watched until he finally blew . When he blew , he blew good . No one could have taken the cheap shots as long as he did and done less about it . " // " It 's different , " says Richard . " Today they do n't have to bother me like before . But every fight I 've been in , every suspension , I was not the first . I 'm not the type to hit a guy . Many times I do n't like a guy , but I get on the ice , I forget all about it . Now it 's no use to fight . Ten minutes , $25 fine . If you keep fighting too long , they send you out . It 's a match penalty , $100fine ! " // " I told him , " says Selke . " You do n't prove anything at your age to take on a young buck . You win ? You 've won so many fights already . You lose ? They 'll say you let a bandy rooster lick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a very quiet man , " says Richard . " At the beginning of my career I did n't know what the English people were talking about . Even today , they ask me to make a speech . I like to , but I am a man of few words . " // " Richard the sphinx ! " says Reardon . " He used to ride all the way to Chicago , sitting in the corner . He did n't even read a book . Henri , his brother , was that way , too . After Henri had been with the club two years , a reporter asked the coach if he could interview him . ' Sure , ' he said , ' go ahead . ' ' Docs he speak English ? ' the reporter asked . ' Hell , ' said Blake . ' I do n't even know if he speaks French . ' Maurice is just a great company man . He shows up for the game . Does a great job and disappears into his shell . " // Richard lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rim of Montreal . " I have six kids , " he says . " One for each 100 goals . If I reach the 700 mark , I 'll have to get another one , but I think I 'll have to stop . I mean , there 's no more on the way yet . My oldest is Huguette . She is 16 and studying to be a beautician . All she does now is ski . She does n't do her skating anymore . I 'd like to do figure skating too , but I 'm embarrassed . Then there is Maurice Jr. , who is 14 . He 's good at school . Not too bad . He 's a fair hockey player , right wing . He wants to play hockey , too . He is an inch and a half taller than me . Normand is nine . This one is the one that likes every sport . A right wing , too . He 's a natural . Just fair in school . Then Andre , who is five . He is starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of young , but he 's all right . Suzanne is two , and Paul is one . My wife , Lucille , has missed only two hockey games in 18 years . She was sick for a week this year . " // Richard adores children and is , perhaps , most at ease with them . He always carries postcards with his picture on them , which he signs and gives away . Children adore Richard . If they are not French , he asks them if they speak French . If they do , they proudly and hurriedly say their few words of high school French and flee with their autographs. // " I never wanted to have a fan club , " Richard says , " because of the exploitation . I have fans but no clubs . Instead of the kids spending money on us , let us spend money on them . " // Richard often skates with kids or referees their games . " The kids all call this one place where we skate Maurice Richard Park , " he says . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . " I come out after the game starts and stand hidden in a corner . I like to play with them in the park . The kids get such a kick out of it . They talk of nothing else for a week afterward. " // One night in Detroit several weeks ago , Richard sat at the bar in a steak house with some businessmen friends . " When I got friends , " he says , " I keep them and stay with them all the time . " He had been telling his friends about Varadero Beach in Cuba , groping for words to describe its beauty . " The wife and I were swimming 50 or 60 feet offshore , " he said . " Fish of all different colors came around us and touched our legs . The wife got scared . It was so beautiful . The water was all different colors . " Suddenly he stopped and drank his screwdriver . " You never know what you want to do in life , eh , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to skate anymore . " // " You said that last year , " a friend said . // " And four years ago , " Richard said and smiled thinly . // " No , I 'm not fed up with hockey , " he said , as he walked back the dark blocks to his hotel through the snow in his deep-blue overcoat and a hat with a red feather in the band . " That 's my living . I 'm fed up with the traveling , the fear of accidents , the .... I .... Good night , " he said , " I 'm going to watch The Late Show until I get sleepy . " // There is a poster on the wall of the Canadiens ' dressing room in the Forum . It is a quotation from Abraham Lincoln . It reads , in part , " I do the very best I know how  --  the very best I can  --  and I mean to keep on doing so until the end . " // " I read that almost every game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montreal coach put that up . It 's right in front of me. " // At the NHL meeting last year there was some facetious talk of the end , the day when Richard would get so old Montreal would no longer protect him and he would be available for the $20,000 waiver price . " I 'd pay $20,000 for him , " said Phil Watson , then coach of the New York Rangers . " I 'd put him in a glass case in Madison Square Garden and say , ' Pay your money and take a good look at the great Maurice Richard ! ' "
