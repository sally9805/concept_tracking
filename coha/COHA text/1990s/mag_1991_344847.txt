Brice Marden 's " Cold Mountain " paintings of 1988-91  --  six of them , big ones , 9 ft. by 12 ft. , backed up by a few dozen drawings and prints  --  are now on view at the Dia Center for the Arts in New York City . This is a show and a half . How fast , how silently , the sight of a real sensibility at full stretch can cut through the visual jabber and white noise of so much of the gallery scene ! On the evidence of these new works , Marden , 53 , is now the finest American abstract painter of his generation . <P> Every artist has prototypes , artists he or she admires and learns from  --  an internal homage that never ends . The problem is to subdue their authority , to bring their lessons into line with one 's instincts . The artist who does this may be called mature . So with Marden , who with this show of huge , pale canvases covered with a loose tracery of inky line has managed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter  --  chiefly , the work of Jackson Pollock  --  with his interests in Oriental art . Marden has made intense and complicated images out of this dialogue . His internal argument about his sources is settled , and the show is an exhilarating vindication of the expressive reach of abstract art : an argument for beauty . <P> Cold Mountain was not a place but a man , an 8th century Chinese poet of the Tang dynasty who quit the imperial court and retired to a mountain community of Buddhist monks and hermits . There , for the rest of his life , he wrote verses ( strict in form , four couplets to a page , each a small tower of vertical characters ) declaring his independence from the material " world of dust . " Cold Mountain was one of those jokester sages in whom Buddhist culture  --  Zen Buddhism in particular  --  abounded . Marden , whose interest in Oriental poetry had been deepening in the 1980s , seized on him not only because he liked the poetry in translation but because of the beautiful and wayward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the look of Marden 's paintings was familiar to the point of seeming an art-world staple  --  humane Minimalism . Since the ' 70s he had been working in a very controlled format of blocks of subdued color butted up one against another ; the image was " built " from monochrome canvases . The quality of the color and the proportional relationships of the canvases were both crucial . He liked his paintings to be the size of a man ( or a woman ) , so that one would be induced without being quite conscious of it to connect them to standing figures , other " presences " in the room , rather than to view them as spectacles . <P> Marden admired Jasper Johns  --  a critic in the ' 70s brusquely but memorably wrote off an abstract twin-canvas picture by Marden as " Jasper 's Painting with Two Balls , without the balls . " And like Johns , he worked in a mixture of oil paint and wax , a false encaustic that gave his surfaces both substance and an inner glow , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translucency . You thought of it as skin . Marden was a brilliant colorist , in a very tuned-down way . His warm grays and brick reds , his low thick blues and his blocks of terre verte , betokened nature , suggesting planes of light on sky and sea , old stone and vegetation . They had none of the inorganic chemical look of so much post-Pop American color . But their danger was that they could turn into a formula .
