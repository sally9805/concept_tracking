One of the most difficult challenges facing doomsday planners was deciding what cultural treasures should be saved . In 1950 the National Gallery of Art began construction of a $550,000 facility on the grounds of Randolph-Macon Woman 's College in Lynchburg , Va. , as a safe haven for works of art . Funded by a private trust , the windowless structure had storage areas for sculptures and screened partitions to protect paintings . Nearby was a three-bedroom cottage , fully furnished and complete with china , silverware and napkins  --  ready for the curator to move in and oversee the collection . Several former gallery executives recall that for years 2 1/2-ton trucks were kept in the gallery 's garage and driveways to transport the artworks in the event of a threatened attack . Each week security staff would start the trucks ' engines and make sure the gas tanks were full . By the early 1970s the plan had fallen into disfavor . " It lost its appeal when Lynchburg became more of a likely bombing target because of some industrial development , " recalls Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
