The interplay of cells and tissues that marks the growth of an embryo is one of nature 's most exquisitely orchestrated movements . And , for vertebrates , the formation of the spinal cord and brain from a simple tube of cells is as crucial to life as it is beautiful to contemplate . But any defect in this neural tube , likely to appear early in development , can be devastating . Among the possible results : anencephaly , in which a baby is born minus most of its brain , and spina bifida . <P> In the latest issue of the New England Journal of Medicine , a team of researchers from Hungary report that women who consume 0.8 mg of folic acid , a B vitamin , for at least a month before they conceive have a dramatically lower risk of bearing a child with a neural-tube defect . Although the link between folic acid and neural-tube defects has been made before , this landmark study of 4,156 women is the first to show that the malformation can be prevented  --  even in women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defects .
