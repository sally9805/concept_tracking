Two years ago , at the 1997 World Amateur Boxing Championships in Budapest , you had to come early if you wanted to see American fighters . Not one survived the quarterfinals . The U.S. amateur program , which had produced and nurtured the likes of Muhammad Ali , Sugar Ray Leonard , Roy Jones and Oscar De La Hoya , was on the ropes and taking a licking . // The Humbling in Hungary was due in large part to the cocky attitude of the American fighters . They did n't bother to adapt their brawling , body-pummeling styles to the demands of the sport 's computer scoring system , which had been instituted in 1989 and emphasizes landing clean punches that the judges can easily see . Says new national coach Tom Mustin of the ' 97 U.S. boxers , " They had entourages as big as their egos , brought their lawyers to camp and acted as if the gold medals were already around their necks . " // The selfless bunch Mustin brought to last week 's worlds in Houston worked the computers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to a late Cuban pullout , Team USA won four gold medals  --  its best-ever showing at the championships . Among those bearing gold were featherweight Ricardo Juarez , a Houstonian called Cadillac because he jogs like he 's reclining in an Eldorado ; Sacramento light heavyweight Michael Simms Jr. , whose nickname Mr. Smell Good derives from his custom of dabbing cologne on his hand wraps ( " So I wo n't offend " ) ; and light flyweight Brian Viloria , whose Honolulu birthright earned him the inevitable handle Hawaiian Punch . // A sophomore at Northern Michigan , Viloria began boxing as a 45-pound seven-year-old . " The gloves reached to my ' 7 " and 106 pounds , apparently big enough to coach the cast of a TV miniseries . " I was supposed to teach the star to box , but he had two left feet , " Viloria says . " I felt like I was trying to turn Urkel into Tyson. " // The most unlikely champion was Michael Bennett , a Chicago heavyweight whose biceps look like grapefruits dosed with Miracle Grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just DNA . " Bennett is the master of the " foo-fop-foops , " his description of the fierce left-right-left flurry he perfected in the Illinois penal system . After putting together triple-F combos faster than any ringsider could count to outpoint Serik Umirbekov of Kazakhstan in the quarters , Bennett said , " I had to set up my shots to kill him . That 's why .... " He backed up and added , almost apologetically : " Not kill him , as much as knock him down . " // Bennett , 28 , is cautious about excessively violent talk because he just finished a seven-year stretch for armed robbery and aggravated unlawful restraint . Since getting sprung from the Galesburg Correctional Center in July 1998 , he has ripped through the amateur ranks with astonishing speed , winning a silver medal in April at the U.S. championships and a gold in June at the U.S. Challenge . " I never expected to win my first international tournament , " Bennett said of his world crown . " I feel devirginized , or whatever you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his fourth year in prison . " I never boxed as a kid , " he says . " I was afraid my eyes would get blackened . " A standout running back at Senn High on the North Side of Chicago , Bennett was the city 's 190-pound wrestling champ in 1990 . On summer break after his freshman year at North Park College in ' 91 , Bennett and a high school buddy held up a Toys " R " Us with a sawed-off shotgun . A few weeks later his accomplice was arrested and fingered Bennett . " Ironically , " says Bennett , " I 'd been studying criminal justice . " // Though he was a first-time offender , he got 26 years . " I learned criminals do n't always get justice , " says Bennett , whose sentence was reduced to 15 years on appeal and who was released after seven . " I 'm not complaining . I made a mistake . Lots of good men have made mistakes . Some pay more than others . " // He started making his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system weeds out the weak and the meek , " says Bennett . " I was at the top of the food chain , so I did n't get eaten . " // His prison mates dubbed him the Toy Store Bandit , a name he detests . " One guy talked such major trash to me that I wanted to fight him , " says Bennett , " though not illegally . " Bennett enlisted a lifer to teach him to box . He ca n't remember the con 's name or the crime he was in for . " If you ask too many questions , guys start thinking you 're nosy , " he says . " My philosophy was , the less I knew , the less I 'd be able to tell . " // Bennett trashed the trash-talker in a prison tournament and became Menard 's heavyweight champ . Over the next few years he was transferred to Danville , Shawnee and Galesburg , got a degree in general education and got ring pointers from jailbirds named Pharaoh , Mongoose and Papa-Son . Upon release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ill. , gym . Six months later he was fighting in a regional qualifier for the national championships . " At first I did n't see potential in him , " says Al Mitchell , coach of the 1996 U.S. Olympic squad . " He was a flat-footed power puncher who did n't keep his guard up . To win in the amateurs , you need defense and sharp , tight punches in bunches . " // Bennett was a quick study . " Let 's face it , the best guys are the tough guys , " Mitchell says . " If you do n't make it as a prison boxer , they turn you into a prison gymnast. " // In Houston , Bennett won the final without having to throw a punch . He was declared a winner by walkover when his opponent , six-time world champion F ? lix S ? von of Cuba , refused to enter the ring . Before the bout the Cuban team , incensed over what it considered unfair judging in a welterweight bout in which Russia 's Timour Gaidalov scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the tournament in protest . ( After the withdrawal a review panel reversed the decision and awarded the gold medal to Hernandez . ) " I 'm a world champ , but I 'm a tainted champ , " Bennett said wistfully . " I earned my way to the top of the hill , but I never got to push the legendary king off . " // Push may come to shove at the Sept. 24 U.S.- Cuba dual meet in Mashantucket , Conn . " I hope S ? von shows up , " Bennett says . " It would be nice to have him on my r ? sum ? . "
