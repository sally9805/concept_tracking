It 's a small bronze V , scarcely a quarter of an inch high , and it can be bought for less than a dollar in any military uniform store . But for a Navy man , it is rare moral currency , especially at a time when , as some vets put it , they give out a medal practically every time you change jobs . The V ( for valor ) pin signifies actual combat experience , and Mike Boorda , U.S. chief of naval operations , wore two of them on a chestful of awards and ribbons celebrating his 40 years of Navy service . At least , he wore them until a year ago , when he quietly took off his " combat V 's , " worried that reporters were starting to look into whether he had really earned them . <P> On Thursday , just before lunchtime , Boorda learned that two Newsweek reporters were coming by that afternoon to question him about the V pins . Instead of eating the lunch that had just been delivered , he told Kendell Pease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going home , promising that he 'd be back in time for the 2:30 interview . When the reporters showed up at the Pentagon , however , the admiral was missing . In the intervening time , he had driven to his home at the Navy Yard in southeast Washington , taken a .38-cal. pistol , stepped outside and ended his life with a shot to the chest . Right where the medals might have been . <P> The suicide was a shock to everyone who knew the affable , pipe-smoking naval chief . Pease said Boorda , 56 , appeared " concerned " about the coming interview but had vowed to simply " tell them the truth "  --  that he had worn the combat V 's by mistake . There were other problems weighing on Boorda 's mind  --  continuing sex-harassment charges in the wake of the Tailhook scandal , revelations of criminal acts by midshipmen at the Naval Academy in Annapolis , Maryland , and some recent criticism of Boorda 's leadership . But the soft-spoken admiral , who loved licorice and would play Nerf ball in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pressure as well as possible . Only last month , in a speech at the Naval Institute in Annapolis , he had vowed not to " fall into that trap and feel sorry for yourself because your problems are getting reported . " He also spoke eloquently about the responsibility of leaders to set a model , and to be aware of both the misdeeds and the personal problems of individual servicemen : " Can the sailor commit suicide and not have the leader know that he or she was in distress ? No. "
