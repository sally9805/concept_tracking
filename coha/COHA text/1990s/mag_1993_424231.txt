Shaping the future of San Francisco 's Presidio will require the most massive planning effort in National Park Service history . <p> FOR MORE than 200 years , the Presidio of San Francisco has guarded the entrance to the Golden Gate and San Francisco Bay . No longer needed for military purposes , the Presidio will become a key part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area on September 30 , 1994 , when the historic Army base becomes a national park . <p> Surrounded by the city of San Francisco , the 1,400-acre Presidio has its own water system , golf course , and more than 800 buildings , half of which are historic . The Presidio offers a wealth of both natural and historic resources . It is home to one of the rarest plants in the world and was the site from which the order to incarcerate more than 110,000 Japanese-Americans during World War II was carried out . <p> The transfer from the Army to the National Park Service will end a process that began in 1972 , when surplus military land on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today the land encompasses more than 70,000 acres of open space , including Marin Headlands , Muir Woods , Fort Mason , Fort Point , Alcatraz Island penitentiary , and San Francisco waterfront areas such as Baker Beach , Land 's End , Ocean Beach , and Fort Funston . <p> At the urging of local conservationists , Congressman Phillip Burton ( D-Calif. ) sponsored the legislation creating the Golden Gate National Recreation Area ( GGNRA ) and included a clause that the Presidio lands be transferred to the Park Service when the Army relinquished them . <p> In 1988 , the Presidio appeared on a list of military bases to be closed . Soon afterward , the planning process began to turn the former Army post with its rich history , noteworthy architecture , natural treasures , and the only free-flowing stream left in the city  --  Lobos Creek  --  into a national park . <p> Golden Gate Superintendent Brian O'Neill describes the process as " the most massive planning effort in the history of the National Park Service . " The Presidio required the most extensive cultural resource @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an in-depth listing of the area 's plants and other natural resources . <p> Today , only about 10 percent of the original natural areas survive . The rest have been covered with buildings , fortifications , an urban forest , and parking lots as well as a national cemetery , a golf course , and an airfield . What does remain are precious remnants of native plant and wildlife communities , which give us tantalizing hints of what San Francisco used to be like . <p> As Terri Thomas , GGNRA ecologist , points out , the Presidio was chosen as a military outpost because of its strategic location and because of its natural resources , which included a year-round source of water and extensive grassland for grazing cattle . Lobos Creek provides two million gallons of water a day to the Presidio . Coast live oaks grow in its protected watershed , although non-native trees and plants crowd the lower portion , forming a dense jungle . <p> Among the Presidio 's habitats are sand dunes , coastal scrub , and prairie and serpentine grassland . These areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) manzanita , on the federal list of endangered species , is one of the rarest shrubs in the world . It was once plentiful in San Francisco , but only one plant remained in the wild on the Presidio until recently . As part of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 's recovery plan , cuttings from the shrub were planted at the Presidio and have thrived . <p> Three plants are listed by California as endangered : Presidio clarkia , a dainty pink wildflower endemic to serpentine grassland ; San Francisco popcorn flower , presumed to be extinct although still listed in case it is found again ; and San Francisco lessingia , a tiny composite that grows only on sand dunes . ( The Presidio has remnants of what was once the largest dune field in coastal California . ) Another rare plant on the Presidio is Marin dwarf flax , listed by California as a threatened species . <p> About 170 species of birds are found at the Presidio ; 50 of them nest there . The endangered peregrine falcon is the only rare bird found on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frog and the tree lupine moth . The extinct Xerxes blue butterfly once lived on the Presidio . Other native wildlife has been depleted over the years as well . Squirrels have n't been seen on the Presidio for years and may have been eliminated by feral cats , which also prey on ground-dwelling birds such as the California quail . <p> During its 150-year presence , the Army has not always been a careful steward of the Presidio 's natural resources . Hiking trails have been cut through the middle of endangered clarkia habitat , groundskeepers at the golf course dug up a sand dune with endangered lessingia on it , and gardeners repeatedly mowed a hillside covered with wildflowers , such as tidy tips and California poppies , in an effort to reduce the danger of fire . Not surprisingly , the flowers no longer bloom there . But the most devastating and far-reaching effect on the natural resources began in the 1880s with the creation of the Presidio Forest . <p> The Presidio had long been known as a hardship post : desolate , foggy , and constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidio were accustomed to forested landscapes , so Major W.A. Jones drew up a plan to plant eucalyptus , Monterey cypress , and Monterey pine trees . Over the years , the Presidio went from a hardship post to a country-club setting with stately trees , lush lawns , and exotic landscaping . It became known as the most beautiful military base in the United States . <p> This artificial forest has usurped hundreds of acres of native plant and wildlife habitat by shading previously open space and causing sun-loving natives such as California poppies and other serpentine grassland plants to disappear . The trees also trapped fog and mist coming off the ocean , allowing shade- and moisture-loving exotics to flourish . Today , dense thickets of English and German ivies , mattress vine , and nasturtiums cover the Presidio . <p> As the forest has matured , it has blocked out many of the stunning vistas . Although some of the trees will be removed to restore these views , much of the original Jones forest plan is considered a cultural resource and must be preserved . This conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The question is how can we restore the natural areas and still preserve the historic areas ? " <p> Although the forest dominates much of the land , the Presidio 's role in military history is its most significant cultural resource . The Presidio has been a military base for more than two centuries and has flown Spanish , Mexican , and U.S. flags . Established in 1776 by a party of 240 Spanish soldiers and civilians , including women and children , the Presidio was the first settlement in San Francisco , predating the Franciscan Mission Dolores . <p> After the Mexican Revolution in 1821 , all former Spanish land became Mexican territory . When war erupted between Mexico and the United States in 1846 , U.S. soldiers seized the Presidio , and two years later all Mexican property in the Southwest became U.S. territory . California was admitted to the Union in 1850 . <p> Several expansion periods at the Presidio produced an eclectic architectural mix . Only a fragment of Spanish adobe construction remains , now incorporated into a wall of the Officers ' Club . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Point in the 1850s , and a decade later during the Civil War , buildings were constructed to house Union soldiers bracing for a possible Confederate invasion by sea . Most of these buildings are of Victorian-influenced architecture . Another expansion at the Presidio came in the 1890s just before the Spanish-American War as the United States ' interests turned toward the Orient . Sturdy red-brick construction characterizes the buildings of this period . <p> The final expansion took place between 1910 and 1912 with the creation on the high bluffs of Fort Winfield Scott , whose Spanish Revival-style buildings overlook the Golden Gate and are considered by many to be the architectural gems of the Presidio . The fort was the headquarters of the Coastal Artillery Corps , which was responsible for a string of reinforced concrete coastal defense batteries built along the bluffs of San Francisco and Marin Headlands . <p> Other significant points in the Presidio 's history include its role as a tent-city encampment following the devastating earthquake and fire of 1906 . General Frederick Funston , commandant of the Presidio , established martial law when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soldiers are generally credited with halting further damage from the blaze by dynamiting houses in the path of the fire . <p> And in the 1920s , Crissy Field , one of the first Army airfields , was built on a filled lagoon and marsh . The first round-the-world flight , lasting 176 days , passed through the airfield , and the first " dawn to dusk " transcontinental flight ended there . Both events took place in 1924 . <p> In this century , the Presidio has dispatched soldiers to every war , including nearly two million military personnel on the way to the Pacific during World War II . Eventually , the Presidio became obsolete as a strategic military holding . <p> As many as 400 of the buildings at the site are historic and must be preserved , although some 250 surplus structures may be removed . There are 26 miles of roads and a water system to maintain . The park 's roads and utilities require extensive improvements , and toxic materials , such as spilled fuel or leakage from underground fuel tanks , must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to the cost of the initial improvements , the Park Service estimates the Presidio 's upkeep will cost between $40 million and $60 million each year . Last year Congress passed a $65.8-million appropriation to be used toward maintenance for the next two years , an impressive chunk of funding in budget-cutting times . Included in that sum is $500,000 for the California Conservation Corps to remove alien plants from the Presidio 's natural areas . <p> Despite the federal allocation , additional money will be needed to improve and maintain the park , and the Presidio , like the rest of the GGNRA , will be open free to the public . As a result , the cash-strapped Park Service has had to consider creative funding methods . Money will come through a package that could include private and foundation grants , government allocations , and , possibly , local bond initiatives . <p> Other funds will come from " Park Partners "  --  institutions , nonprofit organizations , and commercial ventures that will occupy and maintain facilities , provide visitor programs and services , and help preserve resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking tenants whose uses will be appropriate to a historic park . <p> The planning process now under way is being done with the assistance of the Presidio Council , which is headed by Transamerica Chairman Jim Harvey and includes distinguished Americans such as filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola , architect Maya Lin , who designed the Vietnam War Memorial , and Yale professor Robin Winks , an NPCA trustee . Council members have generated offers of pro bono work for everything from architectural and environmental design to legal assistance . <p> From the start , planners have sought public comment on ideas and concerns for the Presidio 's future . From this process , a single unifying theme emerged  --  to establish an international environmental research center . Next the council sent out a " Call for Interest " to hundreds of organizations asking for proposals to locate appropriate programs at the Presidio . This public solicitation garnered more than 400 proposals . " Some are pretty flaky a bungee jumping tower tops the list , but others are visionary , exciting , and in keeping with the environmental theme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Gorbachev Foundation , U.S.A. , headed by former Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev . The foundation 's goal is to strengthen democracy in the former Soviet Union and address environmental needs in the world . Other ideas include establishing a western outpost for the Smithsonian Institution , and groups such as the California Academy of Sciences and the Exploratorium ( a science museum for young people ) propose creating a science education center " second to none in the United States , " O'Neill says . " It could change the way science is taught in this country for the coming decades . " <p> Another theme addresses the issue of youth at risk , along the idea of a National Academy for Youth Service , to help troubled young people learn environmental science , construction , and other valuable skills . The program would be patterned after the successful California Conservation Corps , which teaches skills and gives direction to young people with troubled backgrounds . <p> O'Neill plans to market the Presidio like a shopping mall . " With some of these ' anchor tenants ' in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Dale Crane , NPCA 's Pacific Northwest regional director , emphasized that tenants capable of paying for space will be vital to the success of the park . " The Presidio 's structures need to be leased out for an income that will pay for the operations of the park , simply because there are insufficient funds for the Park Service to do it . And if they do n't raise the money , the federal government certainly will not provide it . " <p> Evaluating the proposals is an enormously complex task , with Park Service planners aided by outside consultants . " The key to evaluating the proposals is finding tenants who are capable of funding and sustaining appropriate programs at the Presidio , " says Michael Alexander , head of the Sierra Club Presidio Task Force , a watchdog group monitoring the future of the Presidio . " . .. We want to make sure the Presidio becomes a great national park . " <p> Plans for the park include provisions for what park officials project will be an annual pilgrimage of more than 20 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , rest rooms , law enforcement and emergency medical services , trails , and public transportation within the park , including more access for bicycles . The Presidio will feature historical programs and traditional military ceremonies , such as the firing of a cannon at the end of the day , and a civilian replacement for the famous Sixth Army Band . Victorian-influenced officers ' cottages on the Main Post will be restored and filled with period furnishings . <p> The Park Service plans to restore as much as possible a portion of the wetlands filled to create Crissy Field . Three drainages that once emptied into the marsh still exist , and a flow of seasonal fresh water could be redirected to the proposed wetland . This restoration project will not affect the historic aspects of the airfield . Another project calls for removing Golden Gate Bridge maintenance facilities from the western side of the bridge , opening up this view to the public . Extensive native plant and wildlife habitat restoration also is planned . <p> Understanding that it lacks the expertise to manage such a large physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be turned over to an independent entity  --  either a real estate management firm or a nonprofit group created for this purpose . San Franciscans are concerned that the Presidio will deteriorate during the transition from military to Park Service ownership ; however , the Army has promised that security will be provided and everything maintained until the Park Service takes over . <p> Although it may take 30 years or more to complete , everyone involved is excited by the new park . It is a place that will contribute to humankind through education and research while welcoming visitors from all over the world . The park will provide a soothing respite from urban life and sustain the Presidio 's unique history , character , and natural features for generations to come . <p> Perhaps Howard Levitt , information chief for the GGNRA , sums it up best : " There 's no question the Presidio of San Francisco can become the most exciting national park in the country , dedicated to resolving problems of the human and natural environment and improving the quality of life on the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLACK &; WHITE ) : Above , U.S. soldiers guard Presidio Gate in this 1905 photograph . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Brick buildings , left , stand at attention along a stretch called Artillery Row . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Only about 10 percent of the original natural areas survive at the Presidio .
