IT IS N'T NEWSPAPERS ALONE that seem dazed by the challenge of just staying alive amid the ruins left by technological revolution . A less-noticed casualty is the venerable newsmagazine-70 or 80 pages each week of allegedly discerning interpretation and analysis , aimed at the educated , middle- to uppermiddle-class reader , serious in his concerns , or mostly so ; interested , glancingly at least , in a wide range of current topics ; at worst , desirous of passing himself at the clubhouse or the church door as more than your average beer-guzzling know-nothing . Oh , those days ! As you 'll know or intuit , they are no more . US . News &; WoridReport , formerly a weekly , is a monthly digital magazine , with " embedded video and audio podcasts . " Newsweek , long owned by the Washington Post , is reportedly contemplating a makeover as a shaper of thought rather than a reporter of events . Time marches on , but ... The " but " is considerable , revealing as much about Americans as about the journalism they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscription offices . Or elsewhere . The Henry Luce style of magazine writing discourages the personal , but I would fall short of the present mark if I were not to disclose mylost romance with Time . Time , which came into myparents ' household ( along with Life ) during the 50s , taught me to read and , in reading , react : punch back , cogitate , or just laugh . The old Time was n't junk food . The new Time-for all its red-bordered sense of importance and its profitable standing in the marketplace , is pure Quarter Pounder with cheese and fries . The dumbing down of America is what it represents . It 's been coming on a while . I ca n't quite remember when I quit subscribing to Time . It might have been the mid- ' 70s ; likely earlier , when its sparkle faded altogether . " Our mission at Time , " confesses Time 's present editor , Richard Stengel , " is to help you navigate this new world . " Dammit , sir , it 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the new Time would be content if I just wandered around to my heart 's content . In today 's journalism market , the newsmagazine is n't about news . No , no , it 's about views and tastes- of which everybody , apparently , has some . Time in its heyday , under its surviving co-founder Henry Luce , had views aplenty , generally of the centrist Republican sort . It so happened that underlying those views was an appreciation of wisdom and culture , which appreciation is missing almost entirely from the present Time . The old Time spoke to an authence ( according to a 1939 poll ) comprising 60 percent businessmen and women and 18.5 percent professional persons- doctors , lawyers , and the like . " Our journalism , " said Luce , " is concerned with the middle and upper-middle class " - a class one might assume was burdened with education , curiosity , and taste . Ahead lay the late 20th and early 21st centuries , with their peculiar obsessions , such as the equivalency of all knowledge areas , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those obsessions , the technological style in news-gathering and presentation : everything fast , everything knowable the minute you want to know it . The old Time , and the other newsmagazines , were framed on the need to know and understand a broad range of events and ideas . What you want to know these days is pretty much up to you , the lonely voyager through oceans of blogs and websites . You pays your money , and you takes your choice . Newsweek 's reported quest to become an interpretative authority makes sense within the modern context of technology-driven journalism . But technology does n't account entirely for the decline of Time . Education does . Culture does . JUST A MINUTE HERE . What is going on at Time ? I checked the March 16 edition . It sure was n't the Time of yore : sophisticated , self-confident . This was a Time looking not so much as to inform its reader as to send him away with a friendly squeeze of the arm . We started in the March 16 edition with " 10 Questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Day " - on this occasion , Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal . Read a feature story about George W Bush , " home " at last in Crawford , Texas ( despite his purchase of a nice ritzy spread 100 miles north in Dallas ) . Then " Briefing " - odds and ends of knowledge . Then a series of unrelated quotations- " Verbatim . " A little later , a 166-word ( I counted ) book review . Followed by a six-page feature on the health crisis , a feature on women 's finance guru Suze Orman , a feature called " The Curious Capitalist , " a review of the movie Watchmen ( citing the new Time 's citation of that eponymous comic novel as one of the 100 best novels since 1963 ! ) . Then the running feature ( so I gather ) " Nerd World , " by Lev Grossman . Then a closing essay on " Cell-Phone Second Thoughts . " It works . I guess . The New York Times 's Richard Perez-Pena says , " While U.S. News and Newsweek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in 2008 , in part by sharply cutting costs , according to Time Inc. executives .... " In part , perhaps mostly , by keeping the product nice and low-grade : a cut above People ( founded by Time 's owners ) but not too large a cut . If not itself totally , outright " dumb , " the new Time is an underachieves Thus , perhaps , the present educational product has rendered our culture . The old Time 's hallmark was authority , stylishly , amusingly rendered ; sophisticated to a degree ; serious when necessary , and that was most of the time , but withal bright , funny . Not highbrow , not even aspiring to that status , but certainly ( the critic Dwight Macdonald 's coinage ) middlebrow : at that , high middle , on a par with the classes that made up much of its clientele . Just for beans , I checked to see what Time had published 50 years earlier than the issue just cited . The cover story- are you sitting down ? - was on Paul Tillich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architect of " a towering structure of thought form which currently commands the littoral of theology . The concepts which are his raw materials may be as hard to grasp and hold as a handful of dry sand , but the edifice he has built with them is densely packed and neatly shaped against the erosion of intellectual wind and wave . " It was the old Time 's way in the old days to use Easter as the occasion for a cover story on theology . For which there was a market . That would be a chunk of my point . There was a market for this materialone that top-drawer writers like Whittaker Chambers , Archibald MacLeish , Stephen Vincent Bent , and James Agee supplied at one time or another . Time was the willing seller to the willing buyer who is presupposed as the driver of commerce . People wanted this stuff , or anyway said they did , in response to Henry Luce 's exhortations . THE PASSING OF THE OLD TIME , and its replacement by the Time of " Briefing " and " Verbatim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture does n't want that old stuff right now . Particularly it does n't want authority , which was Time 's hallmark . Time , in its early days ( Luce and Briton Hadden , a pair of Yale graduates , founded it in 1923 ) , advertised itself as a " magazine devoted to Summarizing Progress . " It framed its stories in narrative form , with a delightfully idiosyncratic style that the New Yorker 's Wolcott Gibbs parodied in 1936 as " Backward ran sentences until reeled the mind . " Time , one chronicler writes , " was a magazine of extremely confident young men " - the " arbiter of the great center . " What if you did n't like the great center ? " Like " was n't required . Some education was , nevertheless ; some interest in topics capable of being drawn out at length rather than briefly slapped on the rear end and sent off to make way for more topics . Nor was Time afraid to bring up particular topics on the mere ground that they were n't on the blogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of Time 's editors to imagine the authence , not the editors , drove the train . Time 's editors , the all-seeing Henry Luce at their head , certainly drove , certainly pronounced , certainly declared and affirmed . Now , at Time , they ask . Questions and queries fill the new Time : Tell us what you want to know and we 'll find out , that sort of thing ; the thing that journalists in all occupations spend more and more precious time and space doing , wondering all the while whether it 's good enough . It may not be . Authority is n't popular in modern America , but you ca n't do without it for long , a point the present mess in Washington , D.C. , over economic policy illuminates and reinforces . Backward our minds yet may reel to dimensions of experience when taste and judgment were stronger things than whim and **29;1499;TOOLONG ? No one ever had to ask Henry Luce what he thought .
