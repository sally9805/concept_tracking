<p> Bigger is better . That seems to be the view of Frank G. Zarb , chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers , the nation 's largest self-regulatory organization and parent of the Nasdaq stock market . <p> As head of an organization that oversees some 5,500 member brokerage firms , Mr. Zarb 's domain is already plenty big . But he wants to become the world 's No. 1 market for stocks and has recently acquired the American Stock Exchange , the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and is expected to announce a Nasdaq alliance with the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong as early as today . <p> There is just one problem . Back home at the very grass roots of his organization , Mr. Zarb is having trouble putting out a little brush fire . Many owners of the smaller brokerage firms that make up the lion 's share of N.A.S.D. members , from places like Redwood Falls , Minn. , West Hartford , Conn. , and Weston , W. Va. , are angered by a lack of representation on the N.A.S.D. And they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynch , Paine Webber and Goldman , Sachs have on the N.A.S.D. 's rule-making board and its operations . <p> For the first time in its 60-year history , the securities dealers association 's election for seats on the board of governors is being contested . On one side are the N.A.S.D. 's official slate , selected by its nominating committee . They include former President Gerald R. Ford ; James Dimon , the former president of Travelers who resigned last month from Citigroup , and Arthur Rock , a top venture capitalist . Opposing these nominees are a slate of four unknowns , put up by associations of small brokerage firms . <p> Each year , the N.A.S.D. holds elections to replace retiring members of its 35-seat board , which votes on new rules and other issues involving the operations of the stock market and member firms . This year 's election , to replace 12 members , will be decided on Dec. 21 . <p> But while other N.A.S.D. elections have been nonevents , this time throngs of small brokerage firms  --  those employing 100 or fewer employees but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in arms . They say they have become increasingly disenfranchised , even discriminated against by an organization whose board is dominated by executives from large , household-name brokerages . Believing they are overregulated and underrepresented , the small firms want more say in the oversight process . <p> " The N.A.S.D. is an organization that is resistant to change , " said Alan Davidson , president of the Independent Broker Dealer Association and Zeus Securities , a one-office firm in Jericho , N.Y. , that specializes in bonds . Mr. Davidson is also the force behind the independent slate of candidates for the association 's board . " They have betrayed the bulk of their membership , " he said . <p> This David vs . Goliath story might be of no concern to the investing public but for one thing . Small broker-dealers , the association 's roots , perform several important functions . They create jobs across the country and help small companies that are shunned by big firms raise capital so they can grow and create jobs . Furthermore , many of these smaller brokers make markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors who are trading these shares . <p> " It is in the public interest that smaller firms be given the chance to survive and prosper , " said Lewis D. Lowenfels , a prominent securities lawyer in New York who represented the American Stock Exchange floor brokers in the exchange 's merger with the N.A.S.D. earlier this year . " The N.A.S.D. was built in large part on the entrepreneurship of smaller firms and must be particularly sensitive to the needs of these firms as it builds and expands its global empire . " <p> Exactly what Frank Zarb has been doing all year , says Michael Jones , chief administrative officer of the N.A.S.D. " To say Frank has been aggressively pursuing and implementing the inclusion of small firms would be an understatement , " he said . Of course , Mr. Zarb and his colleagues have to serve many masters : large firms and small , investors trading in Nasdaq stocks , issuers whose shares trade on the various Nasdaq markets . <p> But even more important , Mr. Zarb has had to work overtime to clean up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Securities and Exchange Commission in 1996 for failure to regulate its market adequately . Increasing the regulatory structure was a natural response . <p> Although the N.A.S.D. began as a self-regulatory organization for smaller firms , it has become increasingly oriented to the big firms . Since 1988 , eight board chairmen have come from firms with more than 200 employees ; twice during that time a Merrill Lynch executive has headed the board . <p> That the N.A.S.D. favors big firms was one of the problems cited two years ago by Arthur Levitt , chairman of the S.E.C. when it published the results of its investigation into accusations about Nasdaq trading improprieties and other issues . In addition to Nasdaq market makers ' unfair trading practices , Mr. Levitt said : " The N.A.S.D. allowed the interests of large market-making firms to have undue influence over the conduct of its affairs and the regulation of the market . " <p> Many small firms believe little has changed since Mr. Levitt delivered his thunderbolt . The N.A.S.D. , however , says that much has been done to open the regulatory structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation of the regulatory arm from the operation of the stock market . " We 've come a long way under Frank 's direction to balancing our constituencies , " Mr. Jones said . <p> Evidence of this happened earlier this year when the board reserved one seat for a small broker-dealer . The association also formed the Small Firm Advisory Board to address the concerns of those constituents . That panel is headed by Carl P. Sherr , who runs his own small firm in Worcester , Mass . <p> But Mr. Sherr is no outsider . He was chairman of the N.A.S.D. in 1984 and has frequently sat on arbitration panels assembled by the association . He is also chairman of one of the association 's district committees . " He is supposed to be our representative , " Mr. Davidson said . " But he 's one of them , not one of us . " <p> Jim Nelson runs Minnesota Valley Investors a full-service brokerage firm in Redwood Falls , Minn. , which has seven registered representatives and four offices . " What bothers me is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I have n't seen any information from the Small Firm Advisory Board on what positions they 've taken on any proposed regulation . I know it 's out there , but I do n't know what they 're doing . " <p> Since 1993 , members of the securities dealers association have not been permitted to vote on rule changes made by the board . The N.A.S.D. argued that sending out rule changes to an enormous membership was becoming too costly and inefficient . But to small broker-dealers this was proof that their input was unwelcome . It meant that the merger with the American Stock Exchange , which was put to a vote of the Amex members , was not approved by a vote of N.A.S.D. firms . <p> " The N.A.S.D. owns and operates a television studio , sponsors the Super Bowl , has plenty of money for a multimillion-dollar sign in Times Square , but it does n't want to spend 32 cents to mail members their own rule changes , " Mr. Davidson said . <p> Smaller firms are also deeply concerned about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infractions . Joseph W. Mays Jr. , president of Securities Consulting Group in New York , advises small securities-firm clients and was a compliance examiner at the N.A.S.D. from 1982 to 1987 . " In the past , some rule violations would have not been considered finable , " he said . " Now , they 're looking for ways to catch firms in minor rule violations so they can put a dollar sign on the examination . They 're turning the membership into a profit center . " <p> For example , critics say that the N.A.S.D. 's approach to overcoming the Year 2000 computer problem has been heavy handed . Many smaller firms clear their clients ' mutual fund , stock or bond trades through larger firms , handle no customer money or securities and may not even have a computer . Understanding this , the S.E.C. suggested exempting these broker-dealers from Year 2000 compliance surveys . <p> But the association said no . Last summer it sent out a 15-page form for all firms to fill out on their preparedness . Many tiny firms were a little late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have probably been overlooked.This time the N.A.S.D. has moved to censure the firms and impose fines of $2,500  --  often roughly half the amount many of them have in net capital . <p> Dues and incidental fees imposed on members have also jumped far in excess of inflation the last three years . The minimum annual fee is $1,200 , but with add-ons , a small firm could be charged $3,000 while a much larger firm might wind up paying only $4,000 . <p> Mr. Jones says the association 's regulatory costs have increased as the industry has grown . But those increases are onerous to small firms . " We service a lot of jeans-and-sneakers kind of people , " said Thomas W. Pringle , president of Mark Securities , a two-branch brokerage firm in West Hartford , Conn . " To treat Mark Securities like it 's Merrill Lynch or vice versa is not right . " <p> Even though the structure of the N.A.S.D. calls for one firm , one vote , many of the smaller firms complain that bigger firms carry more weight with the market supervisors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hold only 10 percent of the industry representation on the board . <p> Although the large majority of brokerage firms are honest , small firms find themselves standing out more on the association 's regulatory radar screen because of the increasing focus on microcap fraud  --  securities violations perpetrated on gullible investors in tiny stocks by bucket-shop brokerages like Stratton Oakmont , A. R. Baron and Sterling Foster . <p> Discussing why small firms seem to be the focus of such scrutiny , Alfred Berkeley 3d , Nasdaq 's president , said in an interview in USA Today earlier this year : " The big companies do n't do it because they have too much to lose . Little teeny companies and investment banks may have the incentive to fool people . And I 'd like to put nails deep in their bodies . " <p> But Chris Nelson , who runs Minnesota Valley Securities with her husband , said many smaller firms are being wrongly tarred by the N.A.S.D. 's brush . <p> " Out here in a town of 6,000 , all you have is your reputation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option not to run a clean operation . " Representatives of smaller firms also point to scandals involving big firms , like the sales practices at Prudential Securities that led to a billion-dollar settlement with aggrieved investors and Merrill Lynch 's involvement in the Orange County bankruptcy . Small firms are particularly worried about a proposal approved by the board in October that would allow N.A.S.D. 's regulatory arm to issue temporary cease-and-desist orders to " prevent continuing violations of specific N.A.S.D. rules and the securities laws . " This essentially means that regulators need no longer show cause to a Federal judge to shut down a brokerage firm . <p> " The view of the organization is that we deal with each firm on its own merits , " said Mr. Jones of N.A.S.D. But many owners of small firms who were interviewed for this article declined to speak for attribution . They believe that retribution by the association would result from on-record criticisms . <p> LaRae Bakerink , vice president of compliance at SK International Securities in La Jolla , Calif. , says they have reason to be concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the N.A.S.D. ballot as an independent nominee , she received word that her firm was being audited by the association , more than nine months ahead of schedule . <p> " Fortunately , I 'm not concerned , " she said . " We do a really clean business . But I still feel it 's intimidation tactics . " <p> Graph : " David vs . Goliath " The National Association of Securities Dealers is facing its first contested board election in 60 years . Smaller firms contend they are under-represented and over-regulated . Officials of the N.A.S.D. , which oversees the Nasdaq stock market , respond that they are simply trying to clean up the industry 's tarnished image . <p> The number of N.A.S.D. firms has been shrinking , while the larger firms are expanding , and the N.A.S.D. tries to root out fraud . Graph tracks number of brokerage firm members of N.A.S.D. , total number of branch offices of N.A.S.D. firms , and number of investigations by the N.A.S.D. , from 1988 through July 1998 .
