Cam tries to shake his greenhorn image , riding hard to be . . . A COWBOY 'S COWWBOY Photograph Photograph // Cam got into the roping club despite the objection of Puck Pattee because Cainey Hill spoke up for him . There was a world of difference between Cainey and Puck . Cainey was quiet and unassuming , with a winsome sense of humor . He was a bull of a man , lean , with a handsome face , its most prominent feature a jaw that looked like it was made out of concrete . Puck , on the other hand , was conceited , a braggart and a show-off . Tall and wiry , he was tough , no question about it , but he was a sour sort . Ornery . They were both real good cowboys , but a lot of folks thought Cainey might be the best cowboy in Colorado . And though there were plenty of folks who did n't care much for Puck , you could n't find anybody who had a bad word about Cainey . So when Cainey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of weight . Cam had been trying to get in for a long time . Hanging around the arena when they were roping , just watching , or offering to work the stock chute . He 'd listen carefully to how they talked and their drawl , memorizing the curious words they used to describe things , trying to imitate them , sometimes getting laughed at or ignored when he used the wrong phrase at the wrong time . Cam did n't care . He wanted to be a cowboy in every respect . Not the drugstore variety who entered the local rodeos once a year , trying to impress people with swagger and spit . They probably could n't rope a calf in a telephone booth . Cam wanted to be what Cainey and Puck had been their whole lives . Real cowboys . Working cowboys . Cam had adopted their lingo and the way they dressed . He had even mastered the distinct way they walked . Short steps , with their weight on their heels . A soft sort of Indian style . Cam felt bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hold much with the idea of greenhorns in the club . He figured you had to take your licks like he had . The broken bones . The horse kicks in the face . The manure up to your shoulders . The frostbitten toes and fingers riding herd on bitter February nights , keeping the coyotes away from birthing cows . Puck figured Cam had n't ever had it too rough growing up back East . Sunday afternoons , during those warm , high-country fall days when the stands of aspen up on Buttermilk and Snowmass looked like they were on fire , the club roped at the Lazy J arena . But those afternoons had become embarrassing for Cam . As good as he had gotten at roping the head of the dummy steer he 'd built to practice on , he had yet to rope a real one from a horse . Most of the guys would n't team up with him anymore because he always missed his steer . When it was his turn , they 'd all kind of turn their heads away , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing or another . Today did n't look like it was going to be any different . When his turn came around , Cam backed old Bill into the header 's alley alongside the chute . He could feel Bill 's hide tighten under him as the old stallion 's muscles tensed , ready to explode out of the blocks . Nobody moved to team up with him . Cainey glanced around at all the guys . Still , nobody moved . Then , rolling the rowels of his spurs gently along Lucky 's belly , Cainey went out of turn and backed Lucky into the heeler 's alley on the other side of the chute from Cam . " C'm on podnah , " he said , looking over at Cam with his funny little chuckle . " Let 's go catch us a steer . " Cainey pulled his Stetson down tight on his head , and nodded to little John Wayne to open the gate . Instantly the big Mexican steer took off at a dead run , Bill and Lucky in hot pursuit , sand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he ought to be to throw his loop , Lucky staying wide to the right and a little behind . Cam 's loop sailed over the steer 's head , clearing the horns and landing right around the animal 's neck . " Pull your slack , " Cainey yelled . " Dally up , Cam ! Dally up ! " It was too late . Cam had been so amazed to see that loop go around the steer 's neck , he plumb forgot to take a couple of quick turns of his rope around the saddle horn . The steer was at full gallop with Bill right at its heels . With no chance of getting any slack on the rope now , Cam clenched his fist tight as the rope burned through his glove . Knowing , as a good rope horse does , when a steer is caught , old Bill cut sharp to the left , turning the steer in an arc so Cainey could snare the steer 's hind legs . As the knot at the end of Cam 's rope reached his glove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set his jaw , and braced for the jolt . The rope came taut as a bowstring , and the steer spun outward with a jerk . Cam 's arm wrenched backward in the direction of the steer . Cainey had come up fast behind the steer , threw a perfect hind leg trap , jerked up the slack and dallied up on the saddle horn , as Lucky instinctively backed up , facing Cam and Bill . Photograph // " Yee haw ! " Cainey shouted , a grin spreading across his face . There was the steer , stretched out on its side between them . Cam relaxed his grip on the rope , easing back in the saddle , heart still pounding , breathing heavy , while Cainey climbed down to get the ropes off the steer . So this is what it feels like , Cam thought , and a grin spread across his face too . Once Cainey got the ropes off the steer , he sort of half staggered back to his horse , laughing uncontrollably . Riding up to the bleachers below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of his lungs . Marty Strong sat atop his horse , swinging his rope in the air , laughing , imitating how Cam had looked when the steer hit the end of that rope . Even ornery old Puck , leaning against the arena gate , could n't keep his usual sour expression from turning to a grin and was slapping his knee . Cainey , still chuckling , looked at the guys , then looked at Cam , shaking his head . " Heck , Cam . You do n't even need a horse . You can just run out there and rope them steers on foot ! " It had never crossed Cam 's mind that turning a 600-pound steer running flat out , with just the strength of his arm , was a big deal , but to these guys it was . It was n't the strength that impressed them . It was the grit , the determination not to give up . After all the kidding and guffawing died down enough to start roping again , Cam figured it was about his turn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could rope a few steers . Puck and Marty were next to go . As they backed their horses in on either side of the chute , Puck was looking hard at Cam sitting on top of the stock chute , as if he were thinking maybe he 'd been wrong about this greenhorn . Puck gave the nod to let the steer out . Cam pulled the gate release and as they took off , Cam watched Puck in action . He was good . Cam could learn a lot from the ornery old coot , he thought , but he did n't figure Puck would ever see him as anything but a greenhorn , no matter how much manure or how many horse kicks and broken bones . ey quit around 10 o'clock . Once they 'd turned the steers out to the pasture next to the arena , shut off the lights , and loaded the horses in the trailers , Cainey and Puck and Leroy got a little campfire going behind the bleachers , as they did every Sunday night . Cam had seen them do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging around them . He 'd never been invited to join them , but he often wondered why they did it . He figured they were trying to preserve what little was left of a way of life they knew was fading out of existence . The men were squatting around the fire as Cam threw his saddle into the back of the pickup , and opened the cab door to leave . Just then , old Puck yelled over to him . " Come on over here , Cam , and take a load off . We 're just gon na squat here awhile , and tell each other a bunch of lies . " <p>
