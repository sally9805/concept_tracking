In the cold-weather months leading up to the springtime spawn , reservoir crappies cluster in deep , food-rich waters  --  a predictable pattern that offers a boon to those who know where to find the action . There are , in the life of every angler , trips that can never be forgotten , fishing treasures so special that you can recall them to your mind as quickly as pushing a button brings a picture to a television screen . The first time I crappie fished with Elden Bailey was one such mental gem . We were literally into action seconds after Bailey stopped the boat that afternoon . In fact , I 'd barely closed the bail of my spinning reel when I was hooked up with the first crappie of the day . For close to an hour it was simply crappie after glorious crappie . And there was little of the typical finesse involved . The paper-mouths were acting like smallmouths , hammering , rather than pecking , at our jigs . They were wonderful fish , a foot or more in silvery length and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around their middle . I 'll never forget laughing like the proverbial kid in a candy store in the midst of this memorable melee . Taking advantage of every fantastic second , Bailey and I simply dropped our fish to the floor of his boat . When they 'd get to be a half-dozen or so in number , I 'd make a hunched-over dash from bow to stern , quickly tossing our catch into the open live well . When the original flurry slowed , Bailey fired up the outboard and within a half-hour had us into more nonstop action . It was n't long before we had about four dozen crappies  --  all that we wanted to clean  --  finning in the live well . At the time it was some of the finest crappie fishing of my life . But even then I realized that what I had caught was far overshadowed by what I had learned . Up until then I 'd equated good crappie fishing with the springtime spawn . Like most anglers , I never gave the fish much thought until the sun grew warmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But on that day the birds were silent , the woods naked and bending to a steady north wind that pushed the windchill to near zero . There was no doubt that winter still had its icy grip on the region . Few anglers were willing to challenge us on the water that wintry day , but according to Bailey , that 's the best time to be crappie fishing . " I know a lot of people 's whole fishing year revolves around the crappie spawn , but they 're getting to the lake about three months late if they want the best crappie fishing , " says Bailey , an expert crappie angler from Lawrence , Kansas . " The winter , and sometimes fall , is consistently the most productive crappie fishing time of the year . " Cold-weather crappies are n't a localized treasure that can only be mined in Kansas or the Midwest . Their feeding habits follow an annual cycle that makes for action-packed sport anywhere there are flood control reservoirs and a healthy population of America 's best-tasting gamefish . Sam Heaton Jr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man that annually spends 150 days , in every type of weather , chasing crappies . But when pressed for a preference , he admits that the winter is his season of choice . " They 're so much more predictable that time of the year , " he explains . Although crappies can be accessible along the lakeshore during the spawn , says Heaton , they 're also very unreliable . " All it takes is a little cold front or some heavy winds , and they 'll shut off . " Every year tens of thousands of anglers watch their work-week dreams sour when a small weather system on Saturday shuts a spawn down for days . Those same anglers could be living their best crappie-catching dreams if they only chose to fish earlier in the year , when the fish are more predictable . One of the first keys to cold-water success is to simply gain an understanding of the winter world of crappies . " The spawn is kind of an exception to how crappies really act , " says Bailey . " They spend much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind or a weather change wo n't affect them nearly as much in 20 feet of water as compared to two feet of water . " During the winter , when reservoirs typically experience little runoff and air and water temperatures remain relatively steady , a stable environment for crappies is established . They remain in the same vicinity for weeks or months , and the fish begin to concentrate on feeding . " Even though it 's months away , crappies really put on the feed bag to get fattened up before the spawn , " says Heaton . " They just know that fall and winter are the times to get into their peak physical condition by feeding heavily and hard . " You ca n't , however , simply motor to any spot of deep water and expect success . Like Alaskan bear guides who look for grizzlies along salmon-choked streams , catching cold-weather crappies is dependent on finding the crappies ' prey , typically shad . Once you find the baitfish , crappies usually are n't far away . On impoundments , the first place to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and creek channels . " Just about all species of fish , from the smallest shad on up , relate to the old river and creek channels , " says Bailey . " The highest percentage of fish in a lake is going to be near those old edges . They use them for cover and traveling from place to place . Most importantly , that 's where the food chain gets started . " Though they may sit dozens of feet below a lake 's surface , submerged river and creek channels continue to carry currents from a lake 's inlet to outlet . Shad school in and around these currents , feeding on tiny nutrient particles and plankton carried by the flow . And crappies gather to feed on the shad , forming the next link in the food chain . The trick to cold-weather crappies is finding where such concentrations are the highest . " I always start looking in places where the subsurface current has washed plankton and baitfish into some kind of structure , " says Heaton . " Outside bends of the submerged river and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically includes brush and stumps on a current 's edge . Little more than flooded landscapes , most reservoirs are filled with a variety of shad and crappie-holding structure . In years past , Bailey and I have done well fishing old roadbeds and railroad embankments , submerged homesites and rock quarries . Merely locating structure , however , does not guarantee success . On any given day crappies will gather at a defined depth . Find the magic combination of depth and structure and you could be into crappies for hours . Several years ago photographer Jon Blumb and I joined Bailey on an overcast day at Kansas ' Perry Lake . As is his usual pattern , Bailey flipped on a locator as soon as he backed his boat off the trailer . We 'd only traveled a quarter-mile when Bailey 's eyes lit up and he tossed a marker buoy overboard . " I usually do n't fish here , but we ca n't pass this up , " he explained as he slowed the boat , his eyes still glued to the locator . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like there are some fish on a 30-foot edge . " As usual , Bailey was right . Crappies were indeed on the edge 10 yards below us , but they were n't thick enough for his liking . " Well , the hard part 's over , " he said as he started the outboard . " We should be able to go to the main river channel , find an edge in 30 feet of water and be in business . " We found such a place along the edge of the submerged Delaware River and we were fast into crappies . We fished a 200-yard bend in the river for two hours , catching fish at a steady pace and occasionally pulling a triple that saw each of us doing battle with a fat Kansas crappie . " That 's the way it usually goes , " said Bailey as we motored back to the ramp . " It can change a little from day to day . The last time I was here they were at 24 feet , but once you find the depth you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same depth and stand a good chance of finding fish . If I 'm traveling across the lake and see a school of shad show up at 20 feet , that 's the depth I 'll start checking first . " Fishing for structure-hugging crappies can literally be a game of inches . Put a bait on the exact lip of a river channel and you 'll be in business . Put it a few yards out over the channel and you 'll never draw a strike . One rare day , when I was outfishing Bailey from the back of the boat , I made the mistake of sending a few verbal jabs at my host . I spent the next 30 minutes empty-handed , watching Bailey haul up crappie after crappie . He finally informed me that he 'd moved my end of the boat over 40 feet of water while his was right atop the magical 24-foot break . Vertical fishing is the best way to accurately put a bait in front of suspended crappies . Noting how far the fish are from the bottom , many anglers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bait at the right depth . Heaton uses an inexpensive , specially designed West Point crappie reel that allows him to lock his line and put his bait at the same depth time after time . As for preferred crappie baits , Bailey and Heaton use a combination of live baits and lures . " I 'll usually start off by fishing half of my rods with minnows and the other half with jigs , " says Heaton . " If the fishing 's slow , minnows may produce better . But if I 'm into them and they 're going good I 'll stick with jigs . If the fish are active they 'll hit them just as well . I also wo n't lose time baiting my hook after every fish . " Vertical fishermen , neither Heaton nor Bailey uses twister-tail jigs . " I prefer a tube bait because those little tails have a natural action , while you need to cast and retrieve to get the best of a curly-tail , " says Heaton . " By using jigs with lightweight wire hooks I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back into place and be fishing within seconds . It saves me a lot of valuable time by not having to tie on a jig every time I get snagged . Believe me , that happens a lot . " Bailey prefers Fuzz-E-Grubs , a plastic-bodied jig with a feather tail that ripples in the water . He uses jigs that match the one to two-inch length of the baitfish and have a head heavy enough to get the lure to the bottom . Both anglers use a " dead pole " presentation . " You do n't need to move the rod at all , " says Heaton . " The action of the boat will be more than enough to give a jig action . " If the fish are scattered , both anglers will use their electric motor to slowly trace the lip of a river channel , picking up scattered fish as they go . " And do n't make the mistake of not occasionally letting your jig drag right along the bottom , " says Bailey . " Last year we caught hundreds of crappies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes they did n't even show up on the locator . " As mentioned , the crappie 's sustained , cold-weather holding patter is what makes fishing for them in the winter months so productive . Depending on the weather and a lake 's location , a pattern can persist for weeks and even months . Last winter , for example , Kansas crappies settled into their winter schedule in late October and maintained the pattern through mid-February . Even if a lake freezes over , crappies will continue their pattern of binge feeding at consistent depths . Wherever they were active before the freeze is the first place to locate them icefishing . My first icefishing trip with fellow angler Jon Hawkinson was another one of those fishing " treasures " that I 'll never forget . I followed Hawkinson across the ice on Tuttle Creek Lake in northeastern Kansas on a day when the windchill was near minus 40deg . Hawkinson led me to a creek channel that had held fish most of the winter . A weaving , open path through the standing timber showed the exact course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drilling holes directly above the edge . We covered as much ice as possible , drilling three or four quick holes , checking each of them out and then moving on . It was n't long before we were both into dense schools of fat crappies . Within a few hours we 'd each filled a five-gallon bucket and the crappies were still going strong . At that time , there were no limits and we easily could have added a few dozen more to our take . Instead , I insisted that we head for home . No , I was n't cold ... I was hungry . Cold-water crappies yield fillets that are much firmer and tastier than any spawning fish could ever produce . Besides , there was no need to be greedy . The pattern would still be going strong a month after the ice was gone . Bait selection and placement are absolutely essential to successful cold-weather crappie fishing . Here are a few preferred rigs .
