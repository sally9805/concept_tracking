Section : COVER STORY If you want to shoot for maximum profits but do n't want gut-wrenching risks , consider these mutual funds and stocks . <p> The goal of doubling your money in 36 short months may seem a tad audacious  --  best suited to Las Vegas types whose idea of diversification is hitting the craps , roulette and blackjack tables before heading off to hear Wayne Newton sing his classic rendition of " Danke Schoen . " <p> But the target is n't unreachable . Investments that offer the potential for maximum gains do n't have to be gambles ; they can be stocks and mutual funds that are already so cheap that their downside is limited . In a best-case scenario , you could get your double ; if not , you should at least get solid performance . Limited downside is especially important now that the Dow is close to its all-time high of 3035 , and many experts think stocks in general are a bit overvalued . <p> Even the most conservative investors , though , should consider setting aside part of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubles . With the recession apparently at an end , even a modest recovery could send depressed shares soaring . <p> So you could call our 15 picks double-or-something choices  --  just the sort of investments that might appeal to Warren Buffett , the renowned investor who 's made a career of spotting undervalued stocks that roll on to mammoth gains . ( For one MONEY staffer 's attempts to find practical ways small investors can emulate Buffett 's stock-picking wizardry , see " Warren and Me " on page 70 . ) <p> To find such investments , MONEY interviewed two dozen stock analysts , money managers and mutual fund experts . Before we get to their 15 picks , though , let 's consider exactly what a three-year double requires . It 's quite hard for a stock to gain 100% based on earnings growth alone . Profits would have to rise at an annual pace of 26% , nearly twice the average rate for blue chips . If , however , a stock 's price/earnings ratio increases at the same time that its earnings are growing , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings per share are bounding along at a healthy 15% annual rate , for example , would rise 52% over three years . But if the stock 's P/E also climbed from , say , 15 to 20 , you 'll reach the 100% mark . <p> You can also get your double from a stock selling at a sizable discount to the value of the company 's assets . A stock that normally trades at 150% of book value but has fallen out of favor with investors might sell at just 75% of book . If the company regains its usual premium , you 'll be up 100% . <p> Though low P/E and low price-to-book ratios are the two most common benchmarks for undervalued stocks , there are others . Some investors seek out stocks selling at prices that are abnormally low relative to the sales or cash that the companies generate each year . But whatever measures you use , the benefits of buying cheap are the same . " If you can get a company at a discount to its real value , " says David Katz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm that concentrates on undervalued shares , " you increase your potential gain  --  and limit your downside risk . " <p> Here then are five types of investments  --  a total of 15 specific picks in all  --  that offer a good shot at doubling your money . We begin with mutual funds , the best choice for investors with portfolios of $20,000 or less and the most sensible way for small investors to hold foreign stocks . SMALL-COMPANY FUNDS <p> Scoring a double in a diversified mutual fund is extremely difficult , but you 'll improve your chances of pulling it off by sticking to funds that buy rapidly growing small companies selling at a deep discount to their asset values or at modest P/E ratios . Many small companies could increase their profits by as much as 20% a year during the next few years . Yet the average small-company stock is selling at or below the market P/E , rather than 40% or more above the market , as is the norm . Here are three favorite noload funds of Don Phillips , editor of the Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,000 funds : <p> Pennsylvania Mutual . Portfolio managers Charles Royce and Tom Ebright have practically made a religion of scooping up the shares of companies selling at about half their business value  --  what they 'd be worth to someone buying the entire enterprise . This strict value approach has given Pennsylvania Mutual ( 800-221-4268 ) a unique niche among funds that focus on small-capitalization stocks . The fund can soar to spectacular gains  --  it jumped 40.5% in 1983  --  yet it has less day-to-day volatility than 94% of all small-company funds . <p> GIT Equity-Special Growth . Rather than concentrating on business values , GIT Equity-Special Growth ( 800-336-3063 ) homes in on small companies with earnings increasing by more than 20% a year , very little debt , and P/E ratios close to that of the S &P; 500 , currently 18 . Fund manager Richard Carney avoids cyclical and technology stocks  --  their profits yo-yo too much for his taste . Instead he focuses on companies with market niches that allow them to generate earnings growth in both good and bad economic times . This fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is capable of gains such as its 47% total return in 1985 . <p> Nicholas Limited Edition . Just like GIT , portfolio manager Albert Nicholas seeks out small companies that have earnings growing 20% or more a year but are selling near the market 's average P/E . And while Nicholas Limited Edition ( 414-272-6133 ) is capable of whipping the S &P; 500  --  its 27% return in 1.988 beat the S &P; by 11 percentage points  --  it also held up well in 1990 's down market . INTERNATIONAL FUNDS <p> Among international funds , closed-end funds specializing in the stocks of a single country have the best chance to double . Since they are traded on an exchange like a stock  --  rather than sold directly to investors at their net asset value  --  closed-end funds can zoom to prices well above their underlying value when investors turn bullish on a particular country . Here are top picks from two fund analysts : <p> Brazil Fund . The Brazilian stock market is one of the cheapest . And Brazil Fund ( recently traded on the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its net asset value  --  a moderate premium considering that the fund has commanded a 21% premium within the past year . <p> Despite a rise of more than 150% in Brazilian stocks already this year , the market is still selling at only 60% of book value  --  compared with twice book for the Chilean and Mexican markets . " You 're buying in at the second- or third-level basement , " says Michael Porter , a closed-end fund analyst at the brokerage firm Smith Barney . " All you need for a double is to get up to the ground floor . " <p> Under President Fernando Collor de Mello , Brazil has begun moving toward solutions to its economic problems . Though still high by U.S. standards , Brazil 's current inflation rate of 5% to 20% a month is a big improvement over last year 's 80% a month . And as Brazil privatizes government-owned businesses , Porter predicts that the amount of money invested by foreigners in Brazil 's stock market could increase by 40% to $750 million within the next year . These factors could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chile . If half the gap closes within three years , the fund would more than double . Porter cautions , though , that any bad news about the country 's economic progress could easily knock it back 10% to 20% in the short term . " After all , this ai n't no Switzerland , " he says . <p> Swiss Helvetia Fund . Speaking of Switzerland , this closed-end offers one of the best ways to profit from both the rebuilding of Eastern Europe and the economic integration of Western Europe . And unlike another play on both halves of Europe  --  the Germany Fund , which sells at an 8% premium  --  Swiss Helvetia ( NYSE , $12 ) sells at a 4% discount . <p> Value Line closed-end fund analyst Norman Tepper likes the fund because it focuses on large Swiss companies  --  Nestle and drugmaker Roche Holding alone make up nearly 25% of its assets . Such companies are likely to enjoy strong growth as they expand into Eastern Europe . In addition , the fund holds about 40% of its assets in registered shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell at a discount to the so-called bearer shares that foreigners buy . But Tepper expects Swiss companies will increasingly allow foreigners to purchase registered shares , providing a bonus to investors who bought them at a discount . Over the next three years , Tepper projects that the fund will return 20% to 30% annually . <p> First Australia Fund . With the Australian economy coming out of its worst recession in 50 years , Value Line 's Tepper sees the First Australia Fund ( American Stock Exchange , $8.25 ) as a way to ride the rebound . " Stocks are still down 75% since the 1987 crash , " he says , " but it looks like the turnaround is just about to begin . " Inflation has fallen from a lofty 24% in 1988 to 4.9% recently . That should help keep the Australian dollar fairly stable vs. the greenback and prevent currency fluctuations from eroding U.S. investors ' profits . As long as demand for the country 's exports of natural resources such as gold , copper and steel continues to pull . Australia out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total return of as much as 23% annually , even if it continues to trade at its current 14% discount to net asset value . COMPUTER STOCKS <p> A sales-dampening recession and competition that has shaved profit margins thinner than a silicon chip have taken big bites out of the prices of most computer stocks . This carnage has created extraordinary opportunities for investors to scoop up shares of the largest and most powerful companies in the industry . <p> Apple Computer . In a way , Apple Computer 's sagging stock price  --  it recently sold over the counter for $45.50 , or 37% below its all-time high of $73 earlier this year  --  is a victim of the company 's own success . Last fall , in a move to increase its market share , the company unveiled a new low-priced Macintosh computer . Sales took . off , but at the expense of Apple 's costlier models . As a result , profit margins suffered and institutional investors soured on the stock , pushing its price down sharply . <p> John Dessauer , a money manager and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes Apple is ripe for a turnaround . As the economy recovers and new products such as its six-pound notebook-size computer hit store shelves , Dessauer predicts Apple 's earnings could grow 20% annually for the next three years . With a rise in its P/E from a current 11 to 15 , the stock would have a 135% gain . At worst , Dessauer figures Apple 's earnings might rise 5% a year and its P/E might edge up to 12 , for a 28% gain . <p> IBM . When IBM ( NYSE , $98.50 ) announced in June that its second-quarter earnings would slip 80% below those of a year ago , the computer giant 's stock price sank to $97  --  31% below its February high of $140 . While most investors see Big Blue 's recent poor performance as a reason to shun the stock , some value managers believe it 's a " must buy " for conservative investors . " You 're getting a passbook rate of return with the 5% yield , plus you 've got the real possibility of the stock price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fontaine , portfolio manager of the Fontaine Capital Appreciation Fund . <p> Fontaine , a former IBM employee , notes that on a value basis , the stock currently sells at less than 1.3 times its book value  --  well below the 2.9 multiple for Standard &; Poor 's index of 400 industrial stocks . If IBM approaches the market 's price/book ratio , as Fontaine believes it will , the stock could go as high as $230 a share . " The great thing about this stock is that you do n't need heroics here , " he says . " All you need is for IBM to get back to decent performance . " NATURAL-RESOURCE STOCKS <p> The stocks of oil , gas and precious-metals producers have been mercilessly pounded this year , creating an opportunity for investors who can catch the rebound . The best choices in this depressed sector : <p> Schlumberger . When oil prices settled in at a low $16 or so a barrel after the Persian Gulf war , the hopes for a boom in oil exploration faded  --  as did the prospects for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader in drilling services , Schlumberger ( NYSE , $56.25 ) , could buck this bleak industry outlook , and its stock could zoom past its 1980 peak of $87 a share . The reason : Schlumberger does about half its oil drilling business in Third World countries where profits can be substantially higher than in the U.S. , explains Shearson Lehman Bros. energy analyst Kenneth Miller . In addition , oil exploration activity in those countries is projected to increase by 21% over the next few years  --  about three times the rate in major industrialized nations-as Third World countries try to become less dependent on imports . <p> Given Schlumberger 's dominant niche in the fastest growing and most profitable sector of its industry , Miller believes profits will grow at least 25% a year , almost enough by itself for a double , even without an increase in Schlumberger 's current P/E of 20 . <p> Wainoco Oil . An oversupply of natural gas and unnaturally balmy temperatures last winter caused a flameout in natural gas stocks . For instance , Wainoco ( NYSE , $5.25 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserves in Canada , has fallen 55% from its 1990 high of $11.75 . Although the stock is riskier than our 14 other picks , Richard Young , editor of Investor Intelligence newsletter in Newport , R.I. , considers it a steal . Young figures that the company 's gas reserves , drilling leases and other assets are now selling at only about a third of their actual value , which is close to $14 a share . <p> The Value Line Investment Survey forecasts that natural gas prices could increase from $1.50 to $2.50 per thousand cubic feet by 1994 . Says Young : " Once there 's a pickup in natural gas prices , Wainoco will take off . " <p> Homestake Mining . To purchase Homestake Mining ( NYSE , $18.25 ) , one of the largest U.S. gold-mining companies , you 've got to have a tree contrarian instinct . Despite some faint signs of life recently , the price of gold has languished below $400 for over a year now , and few economists expect another episode of the rapid inflation that sent gold prices soaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling at 25% below its 1987 high . <p> Young , however , sees a compelling case for the stock : Homestake is one of the most efficient , lowest cost producers of gold bullion . As a result , he says , " this company can make a profit even without a jump in the price of gold . " In June , Homestake Mining sold for $14 a share , or just 1.5 times its book value , vs. anywhere from 2.5 to five times book in the past . From its recent price of $18.50 , or 2.3 times book value , Young foresees a gain of nearly 50% . Since gold stocks are extremely volatile , Homestake could easily slip back below $15 . If it does , Young considers it a solid double from that price . TURNAROUND STOCKS <p> Some of the market 's most stunning returns go to farsighted contrarian investors who buy into a troubled company that is on the verge of revival . Here are four comeback candidates : <p> Ford . An earnings drop of 80% last year and a probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the NYSE  --  37% below its 1989 all-time peak of $56.50 a share . But where others see red ink and a devastated stock , David Katz of Matrix Asset Advisors sees value : " You 're buying a major company at a big discount to its actual value  --  plus you 're getting a 4.5% yield . " The benchmark that Katz uses for valuing Ford is the company 's price-to-sales ratio  --  that is , the share price divided by the company 's sales per share . Ford 's recent price-to-sales ratio was just 0.16-30% below its 0.23 average and more than 50% below its 0.4 high for the past five years . As the U.S. comes out of recession , Katz expects Ford 's sales to rebound from $215 a share to more than $250 by early 1994 . " The average age of cars on the road is at a record high of seven years , " says Katz . " So when the economy recovers , there should be a lot of pent-up demand . " If the stock exceeds its average price-per-sales ratio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By any measure , Sears is a cheap stock and one of the best values on the market today , " says Mark Boyar , a New York City money manager . By Boyar 's reckoning , the parts of the company  --  whose shares trade on the NYSE at $37.50  --  are worth a lot more than the whole . If you tot up the value of the Sears retailing operation and the real estate value of its stores , then add in what subsidiaries such as Allstate Insurance , Dean Witter and real estate firm Coldwell Banker are worth , you come up with at least $80 a share . In addition , Sears is finally breathing life into its moribund retailing division and cutting costs  --  by the end of this year , the company expects to eliminate 31,000 jobs . " On top of that , " says Boyar , " you 're getting a 5% yield . " <p> Fieldcrest Cannon . Unlike its towels , you can get Fieldcrest : Cannon 's stock below retail . In 1986 , when takeover fever in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this major manufacturer of towels and bed linens reached $43 a share . But after years of subpar profits , the stock nosedived to as little as $6 and now sells for $13.50 on the NYSE . Says Boyar : " At that price , this stock is selling at just over half its book value . " The company has been whipping itself into shape , dropping unprofitable divisions and trimming some 1,800 employees from its bloated payroll . As a result , says Boyar , " even a meager economic recovery will lead to an exceptional boost to the bottom line . " With a recovery to book value  --  a reasonable assumption given that other major textile companies have been acquired at nearly twice book value as recently as 1989  --  Boyar figures that Fieldcrest would hit $25 . <p> Laidlaw . A recession-induced earnings decline has laid low the stock of Laidlaw , which is the third largest solid-waste-management company in North America . The company 's class-B shares ( which trade more actively than the voting class-A shares ) have sunk to $10 on the NYSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was reached last year . What 's more , the stock now sells at just nine times earnings or 50% below the overall market 's P/E , compared with a premium of 20% to 50% that the company enjoyed in the late 1980s . <p> As the economy rebounds , Katz expects Laidlaw 's earnings to grow again at 15% or so a year  --  and he thinks the stock could sell at a P/E ratio 10% above that of the market . Says Katz : " We think Laidlaw should sell for at least $20 within three years and could sell for as much as $25 . " <p> Keep in mind that the ride with Laidlaw , as well as with these other turnaround stocks , can be bumpy . But price swings should n't bother you if you start buying near the bottom . After all , volatility is n't so nasty when you 're riding it to a 100% gain . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> BY WALTER L. UPDEGRAVE <p>                  @ @ @
