Throughout his writing career , which began in the 1970s , Ole Hyltoft 's message has been that of the redeeming power of love and human compassion in an otherwise corrupt world . <p> " Good Manners " is taken from one of Ole Hyltoft 's major works , the collection Tante Isidora og andre fortaellinger ( 1982 ; Aunt Isidora and Other Stories ) . In this short story corruption finds expression through the indifference to - if not outright ridicule and exploitation of - older people . Satire gives way to subtle irony and most of all to sympathetic humor . Hyltoft portrays downtrodden , occasionally neglected human beings with all their disappointments and stunted feelings , illusions and delusions . <p> In " Good Manners " we encounter them in a well-to-do northern suburb of Copenhagen . But only initially , for it turns out that the retired life of Laurits Henningsen in Springtorbi during the summer months is nothing but a facade . His elegant apparition and distinguished behavior stir curiosity in his surroundings to an almost unbearable degree . Initially he is seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes increasingly prominent in order to show his solidarity with Henningsen as one layer after another is peeled off his facade . <p> As the story progresses the true milieu becomes that of a modest working class district , where Henningsen lives during the winter with his disabled sister , whose hard work finances his summer months . It also turns out that she is the mysterious woman who sometimes visits him in Springforbi . Here the perspective of the story expands into a semi-tragic account of the solidarity of a brother and a sister and their shared disappointment about the callousness of the sister 's son . <p> It then turns out that not Henningsen , as the reader thought , but his worn-out sister is the true heroic character of the story . Her love can only find expression through selfsacrifice both towards her brother and her son . Yet her renunciation also demonstrates a hidden strength . As do Hyltoft 's other recent works , " Good Manners " invites reflection upon the question of what it is to be a human being in a social context . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human spirit . <p> - Sven H. Rossel Chair of Scandinavian Studies at the University of Vienna , Austria <p> It was September , the grape season . The station master slowly let a grape in between his lips , wondering why Henningsen was standing there on the platform ready to leave . Today was Friday . It was on Wednesdays , always on Wednesdays , that Henningsen used to take the train from Springforbi to the City , the 10 o'clock train , that is , not the 11 o'clock train he now awaited . <p> Otherwise Henningsen was no different from usual : a light gray suit with a knife-edge crease in the trousers , and light shoes decorated with white leather across the instep . He was a little overdressed in the station master 's opinion , and the braided basket at his feet was a little too French with the dual lid and the thin handle . <p> Henningsen was Fortune 's chosen in Springforbi . Unlike the other gentlemen in their prime of life who lived here , Henningsen did not have to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the managing director 's chair . He was an independent gentleman . It showed on him . The waves of the Oresund twinkled in the fresh color of his face . It was caused by brisk walks in Skodsborg and T ; Arba-k , or along the paths of Jagersborg Forest . <p> " An independent gentleman " was what they called him in Springforbi . He called himself a chartered accountant . But an accountant checked accounts , and Henningsen went for walks . Anybody could tell that Henningsen could not both walk and check accounts under gently waving beech trees and along gurgling sandy beaches . In Springforbi all agreed that Henningsen 's title of chartered accountant was his own quiet way of having a bit of fun . <p> L. Henningsen : He used his last name only . If someone wanted to know his first name , he only delivered this insignificant L. Nobody knew what L. represented except for the station master , who smiled at the thought . <p> Otherwise there were no secrets about Henningsen . He was an institution . Every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the grocer 's house near Strandvejen ( Beach Avenue ) . To the year-round residents he was the herald of spring along with the anemones and the song of the skylark . <p> The station master picked another grape from the bunch , put it in his mouth , and turned his face up towards the sun , which had now crept up above the tallest beeches of Dyrehave ( Deer Park ) : the last sunbeams of summer . It was important to take it all in . In about two weeks the early autumn winds would probably set in with rain and whirling wet leaves . That would be the end of the summer . <p> This summer had done Henningsen good . His curved forehead , aquiline nose , and upper lip , which stuck out just a bit seductively perhaps over the lower lip , all had turned Indian brown . It was exactly the olive tan that young girls could not resist , even on a man a little after his prime of life . <p> Nobody in Springforbi knew exactly how old Henningsen was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , and his self-assured gait were those of a well-preserved fifty-year old . Henningsen had been a character in the summer life of Springforbi during the twelve years the station master had held his post there . But people who had lived there much longer could not remember a time that Springforbi had been without Henningsen . So it might be true what some people said that Henningsen was not fifty , but rather ten or even twenty years older . At any rate , the grocer recounted that Henningsen remembered plays performed at the Royal Theatre of Copenhagen at the time of Methuselah . <p> If Henningsen , the independent gentleman , were so much older than he looked , it would be easier to understand why he led the life that he did . In Springforbi it could not be concealed who entered and left the narrow staircase leading to the second floor of the grocer 's house . No ladies entered , none on a secret errand anyway , though Henningsen had a lovely apartment . His windows were placed under the leaves of the trees on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prettiest curtain you could have to protect you from the sun , which shone from the plain in the Deer Park and the Eremitage Castle . The golden-green light of the two bachelor rooms was ideal for a love affair , except that there was no mistress . <p> It was not that Henningsen lacked company . Even though he was a wellto-do man he had a knack for getting into conversation with the fishermen at the wharf and the craftsmen up and down the coast . Then , of course , in the late afternoon there were the managing directors who came by way of a small path from the train station on their way home to their villas . <p> Besides Henningsen had his Wednesdays in Copenhagen , and no one in Springforbi had any doubts as to how they were spent . Any other way would be a downright shame . Such a handsome man ! People living along the coast are not prim . But Henningsen , who loved a bit of conversation , did not reply when the managing directors on their way to the trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Sylvia ! " <p> Now and then Henningsen went so far in his shyness as to maintain that he went to Copenhagen to see his sister on Wednesdays . That was a big laugh among the gentlemen in the gardens of Springtorbi . It is true that a couple of times in the course of the summer an elderly lady arrived by train . Henningsen met her at the train station with brotherly love . It is true that this lady had an aquiline nose like Henningsen , but he had a chocolate tan while she was as pale as a maggot . Henningsen had a straight back , but she was bent double . To tell you the truth , she was stooping like a jib arm and looked like a worn-out working class woman . People supposed she was a girl friend from the independent gentleman 's youth , and now he did not have the heart to drop her entirely . <p> The grocer had another explanation for Henningsen 's secretive trips to the metropolis . It was a real grocers explanation , which - such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , because it might damage his business if it were circulated . The clue that led him to it was the braided basket , the one Henningsen was now parading in front of the railway tracks . He always took this basket with him to the City and brought it home again from the City . The contents of the basket were the problem for they were delicacies from the best delicatessens in Copenhagen , which Henningsen no doubt brought home every Wednesday evening . The grocers supplies were not exquisite enough for a spoiled , work-shy , stuck-up so-and-so as L. Henningsen . It was such a small grocery bill the grocer could confront his lodger with every month that he had to have other supplies to keep him alive . Since the grocers news from the other food suppliers on Beach Avenue was that Henningsen was not anyone else 's customer , the necessary supplies had to come from the Wednesday basket . As the years went by , and Henningsen 's monthly bill grew bigger only because of the annual rent rise , the grocer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month the grocer got so furious that he gave Henningsen notice ( but only in his mind ) . Henningsen was one of the attractions of Springforbi , so the grocer would risk a much greater loss in goodwill from his other customers , who had more purchasing power , if he gave Henningsen notice , compared to what little he lost by having a lodger with the insolence to have such a low level of consumption . <p> In short , L. Henningsen , the independent gentleman , had class . He had every local managing director 's dream of a vegetative life : the kind of life they desperately wanted , the kind of life that would drive them to despair , in other words the kind of life their wives lived . <p> Yes , L. Henningsen , aquiline-nosed and sun-tanned , was having a life that was cut out for idle wives . The mere fact that the back rooms atop the grocery store in the shade of the leaves was a love nest where housewives might have their afternoon desires fulfilled left no doubt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this fulfillment . They would be pleased that their forty-five-year-old common-law wives had some diversion now that the children were off their hands , and the managing directors ' sexual interests went in the direction of less down-to-earth targets . The blue Oresund and the green Deer Park were designed for passionate couples , so to speak , who appreciated walking and regular habits , as Henningsen did . And the many front doors that were open to Henningsen suggested that many a managing director 's wife considered it meaningful to free the idle stroller from a non-female hell . <p> Henningsen took advantage of these doors , but rarely for more than short calls . He accepted a single glass of sherry , preferably when the master of the house was present . It would take very deep digging into the history of Springforbi to remember a summer when Henningsen , the bachelor , had been seen in the arms of a woman. , Some of the older inhabitants , however , thought they could remember a few incidents of this kind . They recalled affairs that seemed hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an end without any warning in the form of quarrels , jealousy , or tragic facial expressions . <p> When Fortune 's chosen does not choose women , it may be that women do not possess the ability to make them happy - in other words - that only men do . In many people 's opinion , however , there was no sign that Henningsen yielded to this special choice of partner . He used to talk to the big boys there not in a sweet but in a rather blunt tone of voice . If he found them climbing the dilapidated old oaks in the Deer Park , he gave them such a talking-to that they jumped down from the tree tops . No , Henningsen was no seducer of the young boys of Springforbi , but rather a grumpy representative of law and order . Those of the boys with whom he shook hands found him almost a bit scary , for Henningsen used only four fingers when he shook hands . He curled up the thumb in the palm of his hand , so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their soft hands . That is how women without children and men without women get their eccentric manners . <p> The station master popped the last few grapes into his mouth and went over to the waste bin to deposit the empty stalk . The train was approaching . He could hear it . How odd that talkative Henningsen had nothing to say today . Otherwise the station master would not call Henningsen odd , even if some people did . Whoever would not like to get rid of his wife for six days a week ? And then on the seventh be welcomed by her with a feast of a meal ? It was true that Henningsen was stingy . But skinflints rolling in money were no rarity along the coastal railway . No , the only time the station master remembered Henningsen as being odd was at Consul Holmgaard 's funeral . While the coffinwas being lowered into the grave , Henningsen had entertained him with the statement that the hole they had dug had to be one meter and sixty centimeters deep so that the dead body could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two meters and twenty centimeters deep at the most it the sexton wanted to have the insurance pay him in case of sinking . <p> The train entered the station . A shadow crept over half the platform closest to the tracks . Henningsen was caught in the shadow . The station master was left in the sun . Henningsen lifted the braided basket on to his arm and approached the first-class door . <p> All of a sudden it became obvious to the station master that Henningsen was going to town to enjoy both the charm of his mistress and to fill his basket with the pleasures of his palate . It was those of the upper classes who could keep their privileges quiet who were allowed to enjoy them , unchallenged , even in these days when the poor were usually favored. rhen Henningsen had entered the train , he stayed in the firstclass corridor until the train had left the station . Then he went <p> in and sat down in a second-class compartment with the basket in his lap . <p> At the station of Norreport he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It went through Frederiksborg Street , Queen Louise 's Bridge , Norrebro Street , and Kapel Street . Here he got off and crossed the street to the Assistens Cemetery . Not until he was in between the tomb stones and the cemetery 's yew tree did he feel safe . In front of his parents ' burial place he pulled down his thin French tie knot , so that he could unbutton the top of his shirt . A sunbeam came nestling in between the tombstone and the pine and rested on the soft ground of moss . Henningsen opened one of the basket 's lids and took out a bunch of blue and yellow flowers picked this morning on the railway path . He laid them down in front of the stone bearing the inscription : <p> Hansine Henningsen Thorvald Henningsen Sexton <p> Kamma and he were to lie here , too . <p> Henningsen turned towards the exit not noticing the look the beautiful lady in black sent him from the tomb opposite that of his parents . <p> In a local store he bought shrimp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the best liver pAte , also a bottle of Sauterne from the wine department , and three chocolate buns from the bakery . It was going to be a lunch out of the ordinary . <p> With the supplies in his basket he stopped five minutes later in front of a staircase in Vaever Street in the shade . But on Kamma 's window up on the fourth floor the sun was shining . <p> That was because it was summer . In winter the sun never reached the third floor . <p> Henningsen entered the steep hollow-worn stairs , stopping an each landing under the blue cotton shade of the staircase lamp . <p> The door of Kamma 's apartment was opened before he had reached it . Behind a jaunty grimace she tried to hide her happiness at seeing him . " is this the inn called Kamma 's Rest ? " he asked . <p> " Come in and be ashamed of yourself , you scoundrel , " she scolded . The short corridor was not wide enough for two . She turned to make room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of her bad days . Her back , covered by their mother 's white lace blouse , was perpendicular to the hip like an ironing board . This happened when her nerves got the better of her , as they did today . She should have stopped working at the cemetery ten years earlier . The last few years had disabled her . But then she would not have been entitled to a pension , and that was what they were living on now besides what she earned as an accountant at the Clothes Store on Griffenfeldt Street during the winter . <p> Kamma also looked paler these last few Wednesdays . <p> " You have to come along with me to Springforbi next summer , " he said . He had put on an apron and was helping her clean up in the kitchen . <p> " A scarecrow like me ! I 'll chase the girls away from you , " she laughed . " The girls ca n't keep their hands off me . Not even if the ugly old witch from the novel Gongehovdingen kept watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You scoundrel ! " <p> She was right though not about the girls . But where in Springforbi would she be able to sit in the sun ? He had no balcony . On the benches right inside the red gate ? She would sit there pulling her black straw hat over her face so that people could not see how pale she was . <p> No , Kamma was not in a state to be moved around any more . But then who in their mid-seventies was ? He himself was able to walk briskly with a straight back ten kilometers on end . But he had not reached seventy yet , not for another four years , and he had not had an accident like Kamma 's . <p> " How is your back , Sister ? " He was filling the crystal salt pot . <p> " If I went down the street , I would be arrested for bumping into people . " Kamma gave a short , defiant laugh . More than his mother 's plea to take good care of his sister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get married , but to stay at home with Kamma . <p> " Will you set the table , Laurits , with mother 's tablecloth ? " <p> He went into the other - even smaller - room and fetched the satin tablecloth from the closet . This was his room during the winter . In the closet his twelve suits were hanging , the oldest from thirty years ago . But they all looked new . Kamma looked after them as if they were thoroughbreds . Every summer someone would congratulate him on his new suit . <p> Kamma 's body slanted over the table , which Laurits had finished setting . She rested her hand on the tablecloth . Her lace sleeve was surrounded by shrimp and liver pate in crystal bowls from the previous century , plates decorated with flowers , and a porcelain coffee pot with blue cups and saucers . <p> " Thanks for helping out , " she said . <p> " It 's only natural , " he said looking away . <p> The door bell rang . Kamma pulled down her sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guest felt Laurits ' thumb caught in the welcoming handshake , he could not help looking down at his hand . Laurits released himself and backed into the kitchen so that Kamma could be left face-to-face with her guest . Face-to-face was perhaps not the right expression . Kamma did try to straighten up , at the same time offering her big hand to the engineer . But as a matter of fact she was looking up at him with a bow as deep as children in her childhood had to present when shaking hands with the grown-ups . <p> It was four years since they had last seen him . The vertical lines at the corners of his mouth had deepened . The sun revealed it . It shone on his face when they had sat down at table . If he and I were walking down the street together , Laurits thought , people would regard us as contemporaries , as brothers about the same age . <p> Kamma disappeared into the kitchen . Laurits was annoyed , now that at length the engineer visited them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the engineer asked . Laurits offered herring and schnaps . <p> The engineer had the aquiline nose . Laurits wondered if the man 's two children back in Aarhus , where they lived , had the same noses . Those children knew nothing about Vaver Street or Kamma and Laurits . When the three of them had left the table this might never have taken place . <p> " Yes , I 'm staying near the Deer Park . Kamma ca n't be coaxed to coming out there with me . " <p> " Do take some shrimp , " Kamma said . The engineer took only a few . Kamma wanted to say something else , but could not do more than place her hand on the tablecloth as close to the engineer 's plate as possible . Her hand was broad , like that of a carpenter . Her fingers could not be stretched out , and there were nodes on her joints . These fingers had been in the soil of Assistens Cemetery for fifty years . The gardener had always been more than satisfied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was also here on the ground , on the soft cemetery moss that the accident had happened on a summer evening with the streetcars #5 and #9 clanging in the distance . <p> If only that pig-headed fellow from Aarhus would now forget his dignity and place his hand on Kamma 's , Laurits thought . After all , Kamma is his mother . It would make her a little shy . She might make a jaunty face , perhaps grunt defiantly , and then limp into the kitchen to hide her happiness . For God 's sake , why was he sitting there as cold as a tombstone ? One should think he could see that his mother was bent double , on her way to be buried in the soil she knew so well . One should think he could see how she hungered for a sign of life from the child who had never become her child because they were poor , or thought they were poor , and because her father and Kamma herself were employed by the church 's cemetery . Kamma 's love at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with his son having become a man who visited his mother , his real mother , the way you visit a great-aunt at years ' intervals , out of duty . <p> And Laurits had put up with not living with any other woman than Kamma . The engineer could not eat the chocolate bun , even though first Kamma <p> and then Laurits urged him to . While they were having coffee , short of conversational topics , the sun crept down behind the ridge of the roof of the neighboring block . The room was covered with winter gray . <p> Kamma finally managed to touch her son by standing in the corridor and shaking hands with him , casually placing her fingers on the back of his hand . " if you 've got the time , you should pass by your grandparents ' burial <p> place at Assistens , " Laurits said . " Kamma and I are going to lie there too . " Laurits closed the front door behind his nephew and turned around to Kamma . She was not there . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the room to join him . <p> " He did n't eat very much , " she said . <p> " People working in an office do n't have much of an appetite <p> " What a lunch basket I can make for you , " she said . " You scoundrel ! " M <p> Author Affiliation
