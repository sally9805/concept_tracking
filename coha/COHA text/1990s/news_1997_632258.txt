<p> LOS ANGELES  --  Leonardo DiCaprio has always navigated dangerous waters . Consider his professional show business debut at age 5 on TV 's " Romper Room . " From the minute the camera light blinked on , Leo was dubbed the Boy Most Likely to Drive Miss Nancy to a Nervous Breakdown . <p> " I was so totally obnoxious , " he recalls . " I kept looking at the camera so I could wave to all my friends back home . I was so out of control that on live TV I was sent to sit in the corner . " <p> The lesson : Leonardo DiCaprio likes rocking the boat . And that trait came in handy last year when he was standing  --  no , make that sliding off  --  the deck of the Titanic . It was a frigid night on the beach in Rosarito , Mexico , and director James Cameron 's life-sized model of the doomed ship was about to meet its watery grave . <p> There would not be a dry eye in the house  --  or a dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other actors , whose idea of roughing it is a lukewarm Jacuzzi , complained about the freezing water waiting for them down below . DiCaprio could n't wait to take the plunge . <p> " I do n't usually pick movies where there 's going to be a ton of slam-bam action stuff , " says the hot young actor . " But I have to admit that it 's exciting when the water is slapping you in the face and the boat is going down , down , down . " <p> Lifeguards doubling as extras mobbed him in the water . DiCaprio did n't notice . His adrenaline was pumping too hard . In his mind 's eye , he was drowning . Every gasp brought him closer to the brink . <p> " Emotionally , for me , it was so totally out of control , " he says , bestowing his highest compliment . <p> Funny , but the young man who stars in this season 's biggest movie , " Titanic , " which opens Friday , once worried that he was all washed up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke into the business by playing a homeless boy who was taken in by the Seaver family on the TV sitcom " Growing Pains . " <p> " To be honest with you , my biggest worry was that one day my tombstone would read , ' Here lies the kid from that TV show , ' " says the handsome actor whose blond hair has a way of shadowing his ocean blue eyes . <p> He does n't have to worry anymore . In fact , DiCaprio , 22 , has n't had to fret about getting respect since he was nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar for " What 's Eating Gilbert Grape " at 19 . Already industry insiders are handicapping his chances ( very good ) for a best actor nod for " Titanic . " <p> It was almost the role not taken . Cameron says it was no easy feat to persuade DiCaprio to play Jack , a starving artist who is " lucky " enough to win a ticket in a poker game to sail to America on the Titanic . On board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uptown girl played by Kate Winslet . <p> " Forget about the technical factors ; casting the movie was the scary thing , " Cameron says . " I knew the movie was only going to be worth something if you care about the people . " <p> Cameron pored over lists of actors , trying to deduce who would have great chemistry . " You can find a great Rose and a great Jack , but if they do n't have a spark , the movie does n't work , " he said . " To be honest , this was the most terrifying part of the process . " <p> Enter DiCaprio , who was considered when Chris O'Donnell and Brad Pitt were deemed a little too old . Cameron recalls that DiCaprio waltzed in casually to read one day two years ago . " In five minutes , I knew he was the guy . " DiCaprio was n't so sure . " He played hard to get for three months , " Cameron says . <p> For DiCaprio , this was nothing new . He also hemmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romeo &; Juliet . " " At first , I could n't see myself playing this geek Romeo in tights , " he quips . <p> With " Titanic , " Cameron adds , " Leonardo was afraid that the movie would be about the ( special ) effects and not the actors . " <p> " I 'm not the type of guy who wants to do big blockbuster movies . I do n't like when it 's less about art and more about making money , " DiCaprio says . But eventually , he was swayed in favor of doing " Titanic . " <p> " Frankly , it was the only action movie I 've ever read that had a really good story and some emotionally charged characters . This was an action movie where it was n't about me playing some stupid cyborg , " says DiCaprio , who also did n't mind that the film was really an epic love story . " Getting to kiss Kate Winslet : That is a good thing , " says the actor . <p> Of course , after playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is out of this world . " I loved that Romeo and Jack are both hopeless romantics who meet these girls and then say to themselves , ' Look , if you have any real guts , you 'll risk everything to be with the woman you love . ' <p> " I think this is just such an honorable thing to do if you really believe in someone and if you believe in love , which I do , " DiCaprio says . " I think you should go for it with all your heart . Love is the most important thing . " <p> DiCaprio is n't some upper-class kid who has a penchant for quoting the poetry he learned at prep school . He grew up in a rough section of Los Angeles populated by prostitutes , pimps and drug addicts . " By some miracle , I avoided real trouble , " he says . <p> He did find some trouble in school , where a fondness for doing a Charles Manson impression meant many visits to the corner . But when he dragged his mom into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born . And an opinionated one , too . <p> From the start , he was told his name was a problem . They wanted to call him Lenny Williams , but he refused . " I resented that sounding ethnic was going to be my big stumbling block , " says DiCaprio , who is frankly sick of telling the story of how he got his first name . One more time : Prenatally , he kicked while his mother was at a museum gazing at a portrait by Leonardo da Vinci . <p> Small TV roles led to " Growing Pains " and then a breakthrough performance as a teenager who was bullied by his stepfather ( Robert Di Niro ) in " This Boy 's Life . " Next came his Oscar-nominated performances as a retarded boy in " What 's Eating Gilbert Grape . " Suddenly , the Hollywood heat was on , but DiCaprio nixed mindless teen film fare in favor of roles of more substance . He won acclaim as a drug addict in " The Basketball Diaries , " a famous poet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Romeo &; Juliet . " In between , he kissed Sharon Stone in " The Quick and the Dead . " <p> " She kissed me like I was a kid , " wails DiCaprio . " I did n't know you could ask for another take . " <p> He has learned a lot in just a few years . " I guess I 've learned the acting as I went along , " says DiCaprio , who explains there is no method to his work . Take those drowning scenes . " It was like any scene where I might be crying or screaming . I really do it . It 's me doing it . I do n't like to fake it . And then , when the scene is over , I snap out of it . I 'm back to being Leo . And I walk away . " <p> What he ca n't walk away from anymore is the fame and the adoring fans who mob him . DiCaprio , far from being some snotty young star , is known for stopping and pressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That does n't bother him . But the media are another matter . " I guess what I have to remember is that no matter what happens in the press , your work speaks for itself in the end . " DiCaprio adds that nothing specifically terrible has been written about him . " No out-and-out slanderous lies , " he contends . " But I realize that even the lies would n't matter . Maybe they make your life sound more interesting in the end . <p> " You know , maybe they 'll do a biography of me someday , and I can just hope they have all these cool false things made up that will add to the mystique , " he says hopefully . " I want to add , when they make the movie , I will plan on playing myself . " <p> And even though the external pressures on him are great , he admits he puts a great deal of pressure on himself . <p> " Being an actor is a hard position to be in . Just because you did a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good . I think that 's why some of the greatest actors in the world go a little bit nuts . You 're competing with yourself in many ways , " he says , adding , " I guess I just never want to be in that , ' Whatever happened ? You used to love me ' situation . " <p> A sigh . " I just do n't want you to find me in a loony bin a few years from now . " <p> DiCaprio actually lives rather quietly in Los Angeles . He admits to occasionally going to the mall in horn-rimmed glasses , which is as incognito as he gets . And there 's a lot to be said of a superstar who still hangs out with his high school buddies . But other aspects of his life are pure Hollywood . <p> He tries to keep his social life under wraps , but has been linked with young actresses Claire Danes and Alicia Silverstone . ( Danes remains a close friend . ) " There was definitely a spark between us , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " she says . " We did n't know how to manage it , so we even ignored each other , because the whole thing was just too big for us to accept . " ) <p> But DiCaprio is not all work . He admits to going to an occasional mall and there 's something to be said about a young superstar who still hangs out with his high school buddies . Other areas of his life , however , are pure Hollywood . <p> And he bemoans the fact that his 21st birthday party got out of hand . His agent told some people . And they told some people . Suddenly things were out of control . Most of his gifts were stolen . " It 's OK . I 'll live , " he says , mentioning his favorite gift is on his mantel . " My best gift was that my dad got me this bronze sculpture from this guy we knew when I was younger . My dad had it specially made , and it 's beautiful . " <p> Which brings him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that statue , and that 's what it 's all about with movies . You mold something beautiful out of nothing , " he says . " You take the risk . " <p> Sink or swim . <p> Distributed by Big Picture News Inc.
