In the first house he lived in , it sat up on the second floor , the big wooden chest , out of the way and yet not . For in this house , the house that he inhabited as if he would never live in any other , there were popular , cheerful places , full of the sense of people , where the radio played and the hard-working legs of grown-ups went back and forth , and there were haunted , bad places , like the coal bin behind the furnace , and the attic , with its spiders and smell of old carpet , here he would never go without a grown-up close to him , and there were places in between , that were out of the main current but were not menacing , just neutral , and neglected . The entire front of the house had this neglected quality , with its bedroom for guests , holding a gray-painted bed with silver moons on the headboard and corner posts shaped at the top like mushrooms , though no guests ever stayed in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother sometimes , but not often , wrote letters and confided sentences to her diary . If she had never done this , the room would have become haunted , even though it looked out on the busy street , with its telephone wires and daytime swish of cars ; but the occasional scratch of her pen exerted just enough pressure to keep away the ghosts-presences from long ago , locked into events that could n't change . <p> Outside the guest-bedroom door , the upstairs hall , having narrowly sneaked past his grandparents ' bedroom door , broadened to be almost a room , with a window all its own , and a geranium on the sill shedding brown leaves when the women of the house forgot to water it , and curtains of dotted swiss you could see the telephone wires through , and a rug of braided rags shaped like the oval tracks his Lionel train went around and around the Christmas tree on , and , to one side , its front feet on the rag rug , with just enough space left for the attic door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big enough for him to lie in , but he had never dared try . It was painted brown , but in such a way that the wood grain showed through , as if paint very thinned with turpentine had been used . On the side , you could see where wavy stripes of paint had been allowed to run , like a watercolor when you did n't wait long enough for the previous color to dry . The lid had patches of small yellow freckles . The hinges were small and black , and there was a keyhole that had no key . All this made the chest , simple in shape as it was , strange , and ancient , and almost frightening . And when you , or the grown-up with you , lifted the lid of the chest , an amazing smell rushed out  --  deeply sweet , of mothballs and cedar , but that was n't all of it . The smell seemed also to belong to the contents  --  lace tablecloths and wool blankets on top , but with much more underneath . He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't want to know . His parents ' college diplomas seemed to be under the blankets , along with other documents going back still further , having to do with his grandparents  --  their marriage , or the marriage of someone beyond even them . There was a folded old piece of paper with drawn-on hearts and designs and words in German . His mother had once tried to explain the paper to him , but he had n't wanted to listen . A thing so old frightened him . And there were giant Bibles , and squat books with plush covers , a little square mottled mirror buried in the plush of one . These books had fat pages edged in gold , thick enough to hold , on both sides , stiff brown pictures , often oval , of dead people . He did n't like looking into these albums , even when his mother was explaining them to him . The chest went down and down , into the past , and he hated the feeling of that well of time , with its sweet deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless somebody touched them . <p> Then everything moved : the moving men came one day and everything in the house that had always been in a certain place was swiftly and casually uplifted and carried out the door . In the general upheaval the week before , he had been shocked to discover , glancing in , that at some point the chest had come to contain drawings he had done as a child , and his elementary school report cards , and photographs , studio photographs lovingly mounted in folders of dove-gray cardboard with deckle <p> edges , of him when he was five . He was now thirteen . The new house was smaller , with more outdoors around it . He liked it less on both accounts . Country space frightened him , much as the coal bin and the dark triangles under the attic eaves had  --  spaces that did n't have enough to do with people . Fields that were plowed one day in the spring and harvested one day in the fall , woods where dead trees were allowed to topple and slowly rot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever visited before he himself came there . Heaps and rows of overgrown stones , and dumps of rusty cans and tinted bottles , indicated that other people in fact had been here , people like those who had posed in their Sunday clothes in the gilded albums , but the traces they left were n't usable , the way city sidewalks and trolley-car tracks were usable . His instinct was to stay in the little thick-walled country house , and read , and eat sandwiches he made for himself of raisins and peanut butter , and wait for this phase of his life to pass . Moving from the first house , leaving it behind , had taught him that a life had phases . <p> The chest , on that day of moving , had been set in the new attic , which was smaller than the other , and less frightening , perhaps because gaps in the wood-shingled roof let dabs of daylight in . Once , when the roof was being repaired , the whole space was thrown open to the weather , and it rained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for except in the attic or in the barn . The chest was too important for the barn ; it perched on the edge of the attic steps , so an unpainted back he had never seen before , of two very wide pale boards , became visible . The chest 's contents , unseen , darkened in his mind . Once in a great while his mother had to search in there for something , or to confide a treasure to its depths , and in those moments , peeking in , he was surprised at how full the chest seemed , fuller than he remembered , of dotted-swiss curtains and crocheted lap rugs and photographs in folders of soft cardboard , all smelling of camphor and cedar . There the chest perched , an inch from the attic stairwell , and there it stayed , for over forty years . <p> Then it moved again . His children , adults all , came from afar and joined him in the house , where their grandmother had at last died , and divided up the furniture  --  so some for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell , and some for him , the only survivor of that first house , with its long halls and haunted places , to keep and to assimilate into his own house , hundreds of miles away . <p> Two of the three children , the two that were married , had many responsibilities and soon left ; he and his younger son , without a wife and without a job , remained to empty the house and pack the U-Haul van they had rented . For days they lived together , eating takeout food , poisoning mice and trapping cats , moving from crowded cellar to jammed attic like sick men changing position in bed , overwhelmed by decisions , by accumulated possessions , now and then fleeing the house to escape the oppression of the past . He found the iron scales , quite rusted by the cellar damp , whereon he used to watch his grandmother weigh out bundles of asparagus against a set of cylindrical weights , which were still heavy in his hand . He studied a tin basin , painted in a white-on-gray spatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent carelessness , and he could see again his grandfather 's paper-white feet soaking in suds that rustled as the bubbles popped one by one . <p> The chest , up there in the attic along with old rolled carpets and rocking chairs with broken cane seats , stacked hatboxes from the thirties and paperback mysteries from the forties , was too heavy to lift , loaded as it was . He and his younger son took out layers of blankets and plush-covered albums , lace tablecloths and linen napkins ; they uncovered a long cardboard box labeled in his mother 's handwriting " Wedding Dress 1925 , " and , underneath that , rumpled silk dresses that a small girl might have worn when the century was young , and patent-leather baby shoes , and a gold-plated horseshoe , and faithful notations of the past century 's weather kept by his grandfather 's father in limp diaries bound in red leather , and a buggy whip . A little box labeled in his mother 's handwriting " Haircut July 1920 " held , wrapped in tissue paper , coils of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff brown photographs of his father 's college football team , his father crouching at right tackle in a paddingless helmet , and of a stageful of posing young people among whom he finally found his mother , wearing a flimsy fairy dress and looking as if she had been crying . And so on and on , until he could n't bear it and asked his son to help him carry the chest , half emptied , down the narrow attic stairs whose bare wooden treads had been troughed by generations of use , and then down the slightly broader stairs carpeted decades ago , and out the back door to the van . It did n't fit ; they had to go back to the city , ten miles away , to rent a bigger van . Even so , packing everything in was a struggle . At one point , exasperated and anxious to be gone , his broad-backed son , hunched in the body of the U-Haul van , picked up the chest single-handed and inverted it , lid open , over some smaller items to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack , a piercing , quick cry of injury . <p> The chest came to rest in his barn . He now owned a barn , not a Pennsylvania barn , with stone sides and pegged oak beams , but a skimpier , New England barn , with a flat tarred roof and a long-abandoned horse stall . He found the place in the chest lid , near one of the small dark hinges , where the split had occurred , and with a few carefully driven nails repaired the damage well enough . He could not blame the boy , who was named Gordon , after his paternal grandfather , the onetime football player crouching for his picture in some sunny autumn when Harding was President . On the drive north , in a downpour , Gordon had driven the truck , and his father had tried to read the map and in the dim light of the cab failed , and headed him the wrong way out of Westchester County , so they wound up across the Hudson River , amid blinding headlights , on an endless dark highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame the boy for anything , even for failing to get a job while he concentrated on perfecting his darts game in the fake pubs of Boston . In a way not then immediately realized , his blunder righted the balance between himself and his son , as when under his grandmother 's gnarled hands another stalk of asparagus would cause the tray holding the rusty cylindrical weights to rise . <p> They arrived an hour late , after midnight . The unloading , including the reloading of the righted chest , all took place by flashlight , hurriedly , under the drumming sound of rain on the flat roof . <p> Now his barn felt haunted . He could scarcely bear to examine his inherited treasure , the chairs and cabinets and chinaware and faded best sellers and old-fashioned bridge lamps clustered in a corner beyond the leaf-mulcher and the snowblower and the rack of motorcycle tires left by the youngest son of the previous owner of the barn . He was the present owner . He had never imagined , as a child , owning so much . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curly-maple kitchen table and the walnut corner cupboard , his mother 's pride . This section of the barn became for him , if not as frightening as the coal bin , a place less than neutral , slightly worse than out of the way . Furniture is one of the forms in which guilt crystallizes ; these pieces that his infant eyes had grazed , and that had framed his parents ' lives , seemed sadly shabby now , cheap in their time , most of them , and devoid of antique value : useless used furniture he had lacked the courage to discard . <p> So he was pleased , one winter day , two years after their wayward drive north , to have Gordon call and ask if he could come look at the furniture in the barn . He had a job , he said , or almost , and was moving into a bigger place , out from the city . He would be bringing a friend , he vaguely added . A male friend , presumably , to help him lift and load what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female , small and exquisite , with fascinating large eyes , the whites white as china , and a way of darting back and forth like a hummingbird , her wings invisible . " Oh , " she exclaimed , over this and that , explaining to Gordon in a breathy small voice how this would be useful , and that would fit right in . " Lamps ! " she said . " I love lamps . " <p> " You see , Dad , " the boy explained , the words pronounced softly yet in a manner so momentous that it seemed to take all the air in the barn to utter them , " Morna and I may be getting married . " <p> " Morna "  --  a Celtic name , fittingly elfin . The girl was magical , there in the cold barn , emitting puffs of visible breath , moving through the clutter with quick twists of her denim-clad hips and graceful stabs of her narrow white hands . She spoke only to Gordon , as if a pane of shyness protected her from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of ogre , an ancestral , proprietorial figure full of potency and ugliness . " Gordon , what 's this ? " she asked . <p> The boy was embarrassed , perhaps by her innocent avidity . " Tell her , Dad . " <p> " Our old guest bed . " Which he used to lie diagonally across , listening to his mother 's pen scratch . <p> " We could strip off the ghastly gray , I guess , " the boy conceded , frowning in the attempt to envision it , and the work involved . " We have a bed , " he reminded her . " And this ? " she went on , leaving the bed hanging in a realm of future possibility . Her head scarf had slipped back , exposing auburn hair glinting above the shimmer of her breath , in evanescent present time , She had paused at the chest . Her glance darted at Gordon , and then , receiving no response , at the present owner , looking him in the eyes for the first time . He smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it ? " she asked . <p> He said , " I forget , actually . " <p> Delicately but fearlessly , she lifted the lid , and out swooped , with a vividness that amazed him , the sweetish deep cedary smell , undiminished , the smell of family , of family without end . <p>
