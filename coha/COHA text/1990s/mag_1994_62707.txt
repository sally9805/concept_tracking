Driving through the black Alberta night , Mike Barnett let his curiosity get the best of him . " You scored on the short side , but there was no short side , " Barnett , a player agent , said to his client and passenger , Wayne Gretzky. // That was the winter of 1985 or ' 86 , Barnett recalls , back when the Great One was also the Yellow One when it came to air travel . So Glen Sather , coach of the Edmonton Oilers , would let Gretzky drive the 180 miles to and from Calgary for games against the Flames . It was on the return leg one night that Gretzky found himself being grilled by his driver . // Earlier that evening , as Gretzky cocked his stick for a slap shot from 20 feet , Flame goalie Reggie Lemelin hugged one of the pipes , presumably taking away the short side . Yet that was precisely where Gretzky had put the puck for a goal . // " How did you do it ? " Barnett asked . // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn the puck on its side . " // Eight or so years later Barnett is asked . Was he serious ? // " I was n't going to ask him , " says Barnett . // When you arc on your way to becoming the most prolific goal scorer in NHL history , you get the benefit of the doubt . // Hockey 's most celebrated player , however , did not begin his NHL career auspiciously . Nearly three full games into his first season , 1979-80 , the alleged prodigy from Brantford , Ont. , had yet to score a goal . Then , with two minutes to play in a game against Vancouver , Stan Smyl of the Canucks took a tripping penalty . On the ensuing power play , the 18-year-old Gretzky carried the puck out from behind the Vancouver net , faked Canuck goalie Glen Hanlon onto his back and roofed goal number 1 . // Final score : 4-4 . Date : Oct. 14 , 1979 . Says Gretzky , " I remember thinking , Wow , even if I never play in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Fourteen years and 60 NHL records later , Gretzky is close to bagging the last significant offensive mark not already his . At week 's end he needed four goals to eclipse Gordie Howe 's NHL record of 801 career goals . It took Mr. Hockey 1,767 NHL games to reach 801 ; the Great One will catch him in about 1,120 . Gretzky 's milestone is the hockey equivalent of Hank Aaron surpassing Babe Ruth 's home run record ... but doing it in roughly two thirds the time . Yet Gretzky has hardly been obsessed in pursuit of Howe 's mark . // " I never really said , ' I got ta get two goals tonight , ' or ' I got ta score tonight , ' or ' I got ta get three , ' " says Gretzky , who turned 33 in January and through Sunday had 33 goals and a league-leading 111 points . " I 've never ever felt that way . " // Gretzky 's feat is all the more remarkable when one considers everything he lacks : size , speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloves and catch one of his shots , and it would n't hurt , " says former NHL goaltender Chico Resch  --  the ability to finish breakaways , a selfish bone in his body . // Correctly anticipating that he would be asked to reminisce about Gretzky 's first goal , Hanlon , now Vancouver 's goalie coach , obligingly obtained and reviewed a videotape of it more than a year ago . Why , then , his refusal to return SI 's calls ? " He 's gone over it so many times now , " a Canuck spokesperson says , " it 's become a sore point . " // Certainly Hanlon has nothing to be ashamed of . He gave up a mere dozen goals to Gretzky , putting him 14th on the list of the Great One 's most-victimized masked men . The distinction of being 99 's most frequently burned netminder is shared by former Canuck Richard ( the King ) Brodeur and Mike Liut , who played for three NHL teams . Each surrendered 29 goals to Gretzky . This fact comes from the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , single-spaced document recently released by the NHL . It makes some of the most interesting hockey reading since Ken Dryden wrote The Game . // The overview informs us that 78 of Gretzky 's goals have won games , 178 have come on the power play , 72 with his team a man down . It breaks his goals down by foe ( Gretzky has scored 75 goals against the Winnipeg Jets , his favorite opponent ) and facilitator . The list of those assisting on Gretzky goals now includes 99 names , ranging from the obvious ( Jari Kurri , who has assisted Gretzky 193 times ) , to the curious ( goaltenders have set up 21 of Gretzky 's goals ) to the obscure : Where have you gone , Brett Callighen ( 29 assists ) and Gord Sherven ( 1 ) ? // Riffling ahead , we find the Goaltenders Scored Upon section , which tells a talc of serial humiliation . Gretzky has scored on 140 backstops . He has humbled an Astro ( Hardy Astrom , twice ) and an Espo ( Tony Esposito , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times ) and mauled a mallard ( Clint Malarchuk , nine times ) . He has victimized three Chevys : Alain Chevrier ( six times ) , Tim Cheveldae ( four ) and Frank Caprice ( three ) . He has dinged Ing ( Peter ) and Pang ( Darren ) thrice apiece , while tallying 46 ENGs  --  empty-net goals . // The goaltenders , of course , sing Gretzky 's praises , but his masked victims also draw comfort from reminding themselves of his mortality . " I remember during the 1980 Stanley Cup playoffs , he came down on a breakaway and shot the puck over the glass , " says Resell , who played for four NHL teams and allowed Gretzky 10 goals . // " On breakaways , Wayne was not the best , " says Liut. // " Far from it , " agrees Don Edwards , a netminder for three teams who yielded 18 goals to Gretzky. // " Early in his career he did a lot of talking , " says Brodeur . " He had a reputation as a crybaby. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : He had muscle-bound enforcer Dave Semenko playing on his line . But the six-foot , 170-pound Gretzky also fought his own battles  --  in a different way . " If a guy ran him , Wayne would embarrass that guy , " says Lee Fogolin , the former Oiler who is now in the construction business in Edmonton . " He 'd score six or seven points on him . I saw him do it night after night . " // On the first day of training camp in 1979 , Fogolin , who had been acquired from the Buffalo Sabres in the off-season , asked a member of the Oiler staff to introduce him to this kid everyone was talking about , this Gretzky . " He 's in high school , " came the reply . " He 'll be here for the afternoon practice . " // " I 'm thinking , This is who they 're going to build the team around , a high school kid ? " says Fogolin . " It took me about two days to see how special he was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the greatest player ever to put on a pair of skates. " // One of the few knocks on Gretzky is that he sometimes overpasses . " I 've been criticized by coaches and teammates for not shooting enough , " he says . " Maybe they have a point . Goaltenders have fatter pads now than in the early ' 80s , which give up more rebounds . And the goal comes off its moorings more easily than it used to , so players can drive to the net harder now to pick up those rebounds . Maybe I 'll have to adjust my game a little bit . But I like to think that throughout my career , it 's been O.K. , playing the way I play , so I have n't really changed my style . Know what I mean ? " // Brodeur surely does . That he yielded 29 to 99 seems understandable . As Smythe Division neighbors , the Canucks and Oilers played each other as many as eight times per season . So familiar were these two antagonists , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice . " When I made a save against him , I 'd say something like ' Not this time ! ' " recalls Brodeur . " And he 'd yell , ' I 'll be back ! ' " // Less comprehensible is the success Gretzky had against Liut , who played for the St. Louis Blues , the Hartford Whalers and the Washington Capitals . " It was luck , more than anything , " says Gretzky . " I scored some real lucky goals on Mike  --  from behind the net , off the face-off . It was just one of those things . " // The goals that Liut most vividly remembers Gretzky scoring against him were on Feb. 18 , 1981 . Liut , then with St. Louis , was still basking in the glow of his MVP performance at the Feb. 10 NHL All-Star Game when he took the ice at the Northlands Coliseum . // " We were down 4-2 going into the third , " says Liut , now in his second year of law school in Detroit . " Wayne already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin Lowe comes in on a breakaway and dekes me into the back of the net . I make the save , but I 'm floundering , and Gretzky scores on the rebound . I put my head down , and I 'm thinking , It 's O.K. , we 're still in this thing . But while my head was down , I missed the draw . I look up , and here comes Gretzky on a breakaway . He puts it right through me . Nine seconds , two Gretzky goals . I got the hook . " // Into the game skated Eddie Staniowski , who gave up another pair of goals to 99 . That night Gretzky became the fifth NHL player ever to score four times in one period . The contest also marked the first of Gretzky 's four five-goal games . The next one came 9 months later in Philadelphia , capping one of the most astonishing scoring sprees in the annals of sports . // Going into the Spectrum on Dec. 30 , 1981 , Gretzky had scored 45 goals in his team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played well against Philly , " says Gretzky . " I did O.K. , but I never really lit it up . " A fluky first-period goal  --  an Oiler slap shot from the blue line caromed off the end-boards and back onto Gretzky 's stick , allowing him to easily beat Flyer goaltender Pete Peeters  --  was a hint that Gretzky 's fortunes against Philadelphia had changed . " I remember thinking , Wow , this could be a big night , " he says . // Gretzky had four goals by the time Flyer coach Pat Quinn , his team trailing 6-5 , pulled Peeters with a minute to play in the third period . In the game 's final seconds , Oiler wing Glenn Anderson sent Gretzky in on a breakaway , and he scored into an open net . " I remember arguing with Pat Quinn when he pulled me , " says Peeters , now a goaltending coach for the Jets . " If Wayne was going to get his 50th , I wanted him to get it against a goalie . But Pat wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only two players , Maurice ( the Rocket ) Richard of the Montreal Canadiens and Mike Bossy of the New York Islanders , had scored 50 goals in his team 's first 50 games of the season . Both had needed all 50 games to do it . In his third NHL season , Gretzky did it in 39. // Was Peeters embarrassed by his role on that historic evening ? Hardly . " Wayne got what , five that night ? Believe me , it could have been nine or 10 . I have vivid memories of coming out , challenging him , stopping him . And he hit at least three pipes . I can still hear them ringing . " // After averaging 71.5 goals per season in his first six years in the league  --  in 1981-82 he scored 92 goals , breaking Phil Esposito 's single-season mark of 76  --  Gretzky has averaged 42 over his last eight seasons ( he missed 39 games in ' 92-93 with a herniated disk , finishing with only 16 , by far his least productive year ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted himself more to setting up goals than to scoring them . // Says Gretzky , " If you sat down and said , ' Name the four best goal scorers in hockey , ' my name probably would n't come up . My playmaking has probably overshadowed my goal scoring a little bit . " // How could it not ? He became the NHL 's alltime assist leader six years ago . Four times he could have won or tied for the league scoring title on his assists alone . In three of those seasons , he also led the league in goals . // " Some guys are just pure goal scorers , ' ' says Gretzky . " I do n't know if I was a pure goal scorer . I did n't have a very hard shot . I still do n't have a very hard shot . " // What he does have is anticipation bordering on clairvoyance . " I 'd direct a rebound into the corner , " says Liut , " and he 'd be there waiting for it  --  bang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I was going to send the puck before I did . How does he do that ? " // " What I want to know , " says Resch , " is how did he always know what the toughest play would be for the goalie to make ? He was always jamming me on my glove side , shoulder high , or putting the puck eight or 10 inches off the ice on my stick side . With Wayne , there were no routine plays . Was he a goaltender once ? Did Walter Gretzky , Wayne 's father teach him that ? " // Wayne takes those questions seriously . " I studied the game . I respected everyone I ever played against . And I was ready to play every night . " // The night Gretzky breaks his longstanding record is not an occasion that Howe is looking forward to . He has decided not to be on hand when Gretzky erases his mark , and he reminds people of the 174 goals he scored in six World Hockey Association seasons . " Do n't confuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eight hundred one is an NHL record . The career record , he has a little way to go . " // Will Gretzky , who has 46 WHA goals himself , stick around long enough to claim Howe 's career mark ? // " I 'm not ruling it out , " he said on a rainy afternoon in San Jose last month , two hours before facing the Sharks . " I just plug along . The game still brings me joy . Like last night , when King defenseman-forward Marty McSorley scored in the first 20 seconds . " In his first shift since being traded back to LA. , McSorley got one off a Gretzky feed . As they embraced , Gretzky 's smile lit up the Forum . // " Moments like that are more exciting for me now than they were 10 years ago , " says Gretzky . " Ten years ago we used to think , This is going to happen every day , we 'll do it again tomorrow . Now I really relish those moments . " // He excuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on skates still has a few such moments in him .
