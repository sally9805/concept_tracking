<p> Behold the inheritance bequeathed to the first elected mayor of this mammoth metropolis in modern history : Hundreds of computers wiped clean of all data , a payroll on which one of every 10 paid employees never showed up for work and a property office that could n't account for almost half the city-owned buildings and real estate . <p> And that was just for starters . <p> In the three months since Cuauhtemoc Cardenas and his opposition party assumed control of the city administration from ruling-party appointees who had run it for nearly seven decades , officials have excavated levels of corruption so pervasive that one of the mayor 's cabinet members described the government as " one big , black enterprise . " <p> The capital 's " successive governments promoted and legitimized corruption as a ' normal ' way of life and work , and implemented it as the unwritten norm for the relations between officials and citizens , " said Cardenas , a member of the left-of-center Party of the Democratic Revolution , who campaigned on promises to clean up city hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where citizens routinely must pay bribes to obtain a water or telephone hookup , a driver 's license or virtually any other government service . But as opposition leaders in the capital and elsewhere in Mexico begin to break the grip of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , Mexico 's government is undergoing a new revolution  --  the birth of this democracy 's first independent system of checks and balances . <p> Using legal weapons that were virtually unheard-of in Mexico three years ago , newly elected opposition mayors , governors and members of Congress are launching unprecedented investigations and audits of government corruption and ineptness . No longer just the subject of speculation and rumors that were swept under the carpet of one-party rule , government scandals are the daily fodder of headlines in the national and local press . <p> " What we are having now is full exposure , " said Sergio Aguayo , president of the Civic Alliance , a private , good-government advocacy group . " That is an important aspect of the change we need . Democracy is not only free and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to create the laws and institutions that will sustain a culture of accountability . " <p> The emerging view of the seamy side of Mexico City 's government  --  which administers to 8.5 million residents inside the city limits of the federal district  --  has surprised even critics of the ruling party . <p> " We 've found even more than we expected , " said Jesus Gonzalez Schmal , Cardenas 's chief administrator . " It penetrated the entire administration . " <p> City prosecutor Samuel del Villar estimated that as much as 40 percent of the city 's $ 4.5 billion in annual revenue is stolen by criminal organizations within the city government , dishonest employees and inefficiency . " We are just looking at the tip of the iceberg , " del Villar said in an interview . " We do n't know how big it is . " <p> Former PRI mayor Oscar Espinosa Villarreal , who has since been appointed federal secretary of tourism , has said little publicly about the allegations . But one of his former cabinet members , whom he permitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used , said , " It is false that the problem is of the dimensions they said it is . It is impossible . We systematically fought corruption . Some of the cases they are presenting now were started during our administration . " <p> Cardenas and his senior officials concede it will be difficult to prove many of their allegations in court because so many records from previous administrations have been destroyed or are in disarray . In addition , the city workers ' union is fiercely protective of employees , many civil servants fear speaking out , and many others have no interest in changing a system that has been used to supplement their meager salaries . <p> Current administration officials said they have found corruption and misuse of public funds at every level of the city government . Examples alleged by Cardenas administration officials include : <p> * Dozens of city offices were stripped of computers , telephones , furniture and files when the previous administration left office . Secretary of the Government Rosario Robles and Social Development Secretary Clara Jusidman both said their offices were bare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> * The city public relations office paid $ 260,000 to nearly 100 reporters in an effort to win the administration favorable coverage ; 38 computers purchased for the city 's public relations department were given as gifts to reporters , and the administration listed 54 press advisers on its payroll who had no job descriptions and no apparent duties . <p> * Of the 16,000 city-owned vehicles Cardenas 's administration has been able to locate , 4,000 are virtually unusable without extensive repairs and 2,000 are in such poor condition that they should be sold as junk  --  even though millions of dollars in fake bills were submitted to the city for vehicle maintenance . Hundreds more  --  particularly late-model autos  --  simply disappeared in the final months of the previous administration . <p> * About 90 percent of all the citations issued to vehicles for violating pollution standards in 1997 were imposed on cars and trucks that were operating within the law , yet none of the approximately $ 1.6 million in fines was forwarded to city coffers . <p> * Criminal organizations with sources working in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steal city funds and divert them to private bank accounts . " We change the passwords and hackers know the new password almost immediately , " said a senior city official involved in financial investigations . " We 've had people brought in who were trained by the U.S. Federal Reserve and we still ca n't find out how they 're doing it . " <p> * City officials say they can not identify 22,000 of the city 's estimated 50,000 buildings and properties because the records do n't exist . In one case , Salvador Martinez Della Rocca , the government administrator for the Tlalpan precinct in southern Mexico City , discovered the city had paid tens of thousands of dollars in rent for a government-owned building that was used as a political office for the PRI for the past 16 years . The building was not even listed on the city property inventory . <p> When he confronted PRI members working at the building , Martinez said , he found copies of keys to all of the precinct 's main government offices , including his , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could have easy access to the offices with little complicity from employees , " he said . <p> Martinez said he has reclaimed the building and converted it to a shelter for battered women . <p> ** MEXICO CITY <p> A Growing Metropolis <p> With 15.6 million people , metropolitan Mexico City is the fourth largest city in the world after Tokyo ; Sao Paulo , Brazil and New York . Mexico City itself has 8.5 million people . <p> By 2015 , Mexico City is expected to have 18.8 million people and fall to 10th place in the rankings of the world 's largest metropolitan areas . <p> Until Cuauhtemoc Cardenas took office as mayor three months ago , the city had been controlled by the Institutional Revolutionary Party for almost seven decades , and corruption was rampant . <p> Cardenas 's new administration has charged that : <p> about 40 percent of the city 's $ 4.5 billion annual revenues have been diverted illegally or wasted . <p> the new administration found city offices bare , with computers , telephones and even furniture gone . <p> the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable coverage . <p> of the city 's 16,000 vehicles , one-third is unusable or in bad repair . <p> almost half of the city 's 50,000 properties can not be identified for lack of proper records .
