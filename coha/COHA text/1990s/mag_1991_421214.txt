When the weather dips from brisk to brutal , toss another log on the fire and have Antoine bring the dessert cart around . <p> For too long , French Canada has been touted as the next best thing to you-know-where . Ca n't make it to Paris this year ? Consider Quebec , goes the advice . Then the advantages are ticked off : No jet lag , no time change for East Coast residents , no visas , no francs , and no hassles with electrical converters or pocket dictionaries . Even the menus are bilingual ; nice touch , especially since entrees often range from basic boar to truffled turkey . Somehow , dining on filet mignon de porcelet sounds less savage than eating piglet . <p> Quebec  --  the province and the city  --  is about to be discovered , again . Montreal is gearing up for its 350th anniversary celebration in 1992 , and the entire region is expected to benefit from tourists trekking north . To beat the rush , the time to travel may be now  --  if you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monuments are at the cleaners , " one Montreal resident says , struggling to find the right words in either of her two languages to explain the bare pedestals and empty shrines . Translation : Statues are being refurbished and museums are under wraps of plastic sheeting , all to emerge postcard perfect in time for the yearlong birthday party . Among the new attractions integrated with the old is the giant bug-shaped building housing the Montreal Insectarium , with its display of more than 4,000 insects . The former Olympic Velodrome , built for the ' 76 Summer Games , is being transformed into a biosphere that will replicate tropical jungles , northern forests , the St. Lawrence River , and polar environments with all their typical plant and animal life . <p> If a preview of Montreal 's celebration nudges you north this season , how far you wander beyond the city may depend on your schedule , your stamina , and your appetite for adventure . Not everyone relishes the idea of schussing the outback of the Far North ( see sidebar ) ; but for travelers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cozy bistros with singing waiters , and overstuffed chairs pulled close to a hearth , two destinations are recommended . The Eastern Townships , better known as Estrie ( " kingdom of the east " ) , are 50 miles southeast of the city , and Quebec City ( " the cradle of French civilization in North America " ) is 169 miles northeast . Against the country backdrop of both locales , Americans may bump into more ancestors than they bargained for . <p> Numbers can be deceiving in this part of Canada , and anyone who equates low population with little to do will be surprised by the tiny towns of Estrie . A favorite stop for history buffs is North Hatley ( pop . 715 ) , with its magnificent old manor houses linked geographically by cross-country ski trails , and economically by inn-to-inn vacation packages . Although French is spoken and the " mother cuisine " is served , the original accommodations were designed by disgruntled colonists from New England and were refined by aristocratic Southerners from the Confederacy . <p> Many of the early comers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the farmers who sided with the Redcoats during the American Revolution . Since these loyalists were n't popular after the war , the British government granted them consolation prizes of plots of land in the hilly townships of Canada . Many of their sprawling farmhouses , later transformed into auberges ( inns ) , still dot the countryside . <p> Other great manor houses of the region owe their existence to another time and another war . After the collapse of the Confederacy , wealthy American Southerners boycotted New England as a holiday destination and continued north to Canada , some by private railway car . The story goes that these well-born travelers quietly snubbed " Yankeeland " by drawing their blinds as they passed through New England . <p> The genteel Southerners brought with them the trappings of the good life ; butlers and maids , , horses and carriages , and the oh-so-civilized pastimes of sailing , tennis , and golf . They built their vacation " cottages " on the west bank of Lake Massawippi , an area still referred to as the American Side . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireplaces in most bedrooms , and private pocket balconies that all seem to overlook the water . Pampered guests have access to indoor swimming pools , saunas , and whirlpools , and if visitors are n't up to plodding the trails on skis or snowshoes , they can always ask to have a sleigh brought around . <p> An easy way to sample three of the finest inns in Estrie is to take advantage of the " movable feast " package offered by Hovey Manor , built as a private estate in 1900 and inspired by Mt . Vernon ; Auberge Hatley , a 1903 converted country estate filled with leather sofas , original art , and beamed ceilings ; and Ripplecove Inn , circa 1945 , awarded the highest rating of " four forks " for its excellent French cuisine and " four diamonds " for its elegant accommodations . The movable feasts are often accompanied by live chamber music , and the service is friendly but impeccable . Innkeepers mingle with guests , fetch logs for the fires , and stand ready to recommend a good book from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great food and hospitality continues north in the old walled city of Quebec , which is reputed to have the largest per capita number of gourmet restaurants in North America . <p> Making a bad choice of restaurants in Quebec is virtually impossible , since the chefs , often schooled in Paris , are experts at blending delicate French cuisine with hardy lumberjack fare . In cozy cafes such as La Caravelle , Le Cafe de la Paix , and Le Parmesan , culinary masters enjoy inching their way around the tables to accept toasts to their treatments of salmon , elk , quail , and caribou . <p> Although Quebec is sometimes considered a fair weather destination to be visited from May to September , its ruggedness is best appreciated in the off-season . Sitting atop a 300-foot cliff that offers a magnificent view of the St. Lawrence River , it is a city of stone walls and gates , ancient cannons poking through holes in the fortifications , quaint churches , and winding thoroughfares . Like the province whose name it shares , it is more than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the next best thing to you-know-where . Quebec is a unique mix of north and south , cultured and wild  --  us and them . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The streets of 400-year-old Place-Royale are so narrow , cars are off-limits during the summer tourist season . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : What better way to see Quebec 's 250-acre Battlefields Park than by sleigh or on snowshoes ? <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Activities at Quebec 's winter carnival , set this year for Feb. 7-17 , range from costume balls to a canoe race across the icy St. Lawrence . <p> By Holly G. Miller <p> CANADA ON ICE <p> The Inuit village of Great Whale sits boldly at the tip of Hudson 's Bay , For 25 miles , ice stretches out to sea , and for much of that area the wind has carved peculiar shapes and turned it into exquisite , turquoise-colored crystal . It is Far North Quebec , and the only ones comfortable here are the Inuit , the Cree , moose , and caribou . Temperatures in winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives are tough enough to go out without hats . <p> In Cree and Inuit country , the land is practically empty . Shadows are long because this area is so far north . Eyebrows of dogsledders are covered in frost , if , not covered up , and skin freezes quickly . <p> The ways through this part of the province in winter are by dogsled , snowmobile , snowshoe , ski plane , or helicopter . For flying machines , landing is easy on the vast lakes , but trails through the woods are tough , the snow often deep and soft . The wilderness stretches for thousands of miles . Communication is by chance ; the Indian villages are nearly isolated : <p> " If you get caught in the slush , " one Cree explains , " you have to get out in a hurry or you 'll be in trouble " During the Harricana snowmobile race last year , one three-man team got caught in the slush , and two television reporters went to film their plight . All five of their machines froze to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a helicopter and used a chainsaw to cut the machines loose . <p> The Cree village of Mistissini ( the Quebec government spells it " Mistassini " ) sits near the edge of a lake about 100 miles long and more than 20 miles wide . At the edge of the lake , called Lake Mistissini by the Cree , and Lac St. Jean by the government , are several teepees , wigwams , and traditional trappers ' tents . Wood stoves burn inside , while men and women scrape hair from caribou hides , stretch and soften moose skins , make rabbit blankets , or cook a traditional meal of . caribou , moose , rabbit , goose , and roasted succulent beaver . Fresh evergreen branches are laid on the floor and halfway up the walls for warmth and comfort . There are no tables or chairs . <p> On poles outside hang animal skins and moose antlers . " The traditional way a trapper shows respect to the animals is to hang the antlers in a row , " says Robert Gimician . Mistissini 's director . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side you 've got beaver skins , otter , a couple of red foxes and caribou hides that are frost-dried . Everything here is frost-dried . " <p> Native toboggans are handmade from birch or tamarack , wood that 's easy to bend but seldom snaps . The toboggans are big enough to carry a moose and small enough to work the trap lines . Three or four families hunt together , and everybody shares the catch . " My friend may be more successful than I am , " one Cree explains , " but he shares his catch with me Next week I may be better . " They practice natural conservation as they trap beaver , muskrat , lynx , marten , and mink , and come to the village only in summertime . <p> But Hydro Quebec and its recent electricity generating projects have changed parts of the traditional lands . Rivers have been dammed and lakes have disappeared under enormous reservoirs . " It 's affected a lot of our people , " says Gimician . " Where they used to hunt and trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic trap lines , one 's they have held for generations . " <p> Because of the disruption , the tranquil Crees have come to appreciate the old ways , and are now convinced that their traditions are good ones . " We changed because of influence from the outside , " says Violet <p> Pachano of Chisasibi , the first female chief of the Cree . " It took us 15 years to realize that ours was a good way and we 've been fighting to retain it ever since . We try to educate the public about the Cree way , about subsistence hunting , about the environment . " <p> Though the Cree lost their traditional hunting grounds , the tribe was able to receive payment from Hydro Quebec . The 1975 agreement gave the Cree $250 million and authority over forestry operation . The Cree also promote travel , offering to take tourists into the bush to hunt caribou , fish , or canoe the wild streams . There are even plans to take visitors out on the traplines for a few days at a time so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While many Native Americans have had their values suppressed or annihilated , the Cree and Inuit in Quebec have survived ; perhaps because of the province 's lack of industry , their meteorological disadvantages , and their isolation . In some way , this could be a plus to the natives and to the tourists who venture north of the 52nd parallel . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Caribou hide , prepared here , is light waterproof , and windproof . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : An Inuit man wears clothes made of sealskin , caribou , and hawk skin . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : With temperatures dipping to-40 Degrees F. , lake landings are safe but bumpy . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Many Cree children are trilingual .
