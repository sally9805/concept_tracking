Rob Chilson notes that he does not have anything against the great state of Kansas ( despite this story 's opening line ) . Though he himself is a Missourian living in Kansas City ( Missouri , that is ) , he admits that may of his best friends are Kansans . In fact , he adds that many of his smartest friends are former Kansans . Like Dorothy said , there really is no place like home ( even if you happen to come from Topeka or from Lawrence ) . <p> HEY WERE TAKING UP Kansas in big bites . Geelie hovered above , detached , observing Stark night cloaked the world under a shrunken sun , save for the pit , where hell glared . Magma glowed in the darkness where the rock , hectares wide , crumbled in the gravitor beam . Shards of the world upreared , uproared , black edged with glowing red , and lofted into the groaning air , pieces of a broken pot . The bloody light spattered on the swag-bellied ships that hung above - crows tearing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet fell back and splashed in thunder and liquid fire , yellow and scarlet . Old Earth shuddered for kilometers around . The glare , the heat , the tumult filled the world . But from a distance , Geelie saw , it was reduced to a cheerful cherry glow and a murmur of sound , lost in the endless night . In her longview , Kansas was a vast sunken plain of contorted rock , dusted with silent snow under a shaded sun . " Aung Charah in Tigerclaw to Goblong Seven , " Geelie 's speaker said . " Goblong Seven to Aung Charah , " she said . " Geelie , take a swing around the south side of the working pit and look at the terraces there . I think the magma is flowing up on them . " " Hearing and obedience . " Kansas was a hole walled with stairsteps of cooled lava , terraced for kilometers down to the pit of hell . As fast as the rock froze , it was tom off in hectare-sized chips , to feed the hungry space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the work site . She peered intently in dimness , blinded by the contrast . The magma was definitely crawling up on the lower terrace of cooled rock . " It 's slow as yet , " she reported , sending the teleview to Aung Charah . " We 'll have to watch it , however , or we 'll have another volcano . Check on it frequently , " he told her . " Hearing and obedience , " Geelie said . She leaned forward to peer up through the windscreen . The Sun was a flickering red candle , the cherry color of the magma . As she watched , it brightened ; brightened ; brightened again , to a dazzling orange . Then it faded , paused , recovered  --  briefly showed a gleam of brilliance that glimpsed the black rock below , streaked with snow . Then it faded , faded further , almost vanished . The Sun was a candle seen through a haze of smoke . But each drifting mote was a space colony with solar panels extended , jostling in their billions jealously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets of old Sol had been eaten by the colonies , till only Earth was left , passed into the shades of an eternal night . And now the Old World 's historical value had been overridden by the economic value of its water , air , and rock . Also , its vast gravity well was a major obstacle to space traffic . Noon , planetary time , Geelie thought . She took her goblong in a long sweep around the work site , occasionally touching the visual recorder 's button . Her Colony , Kinabatangan , was a member of The Obstacle-Leaping Consortium ; she was part of Kinabatangan 's observer team . A gleam of light caught her eye , and she looked sharply aside . East , she realized . Puzzled , she looped the goblong back again more slowly and sought for the gleam . She found it , but it immediately winked out . That was odd , she thought . A bright light , yellow or even white surely artificial - on the highlands to the east . That was disputed land , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , observers had set up a camp on the planet . She called Aung Charah and reported , got permission to check it out . " If I can find it , " she said . " The light is gone again ; door closed , perhaps . " " I 'm having Communications call ; I 'll keep you informed , " Aung Charah said . She acknowledged and cruised as nearly straight as she could along the beam she 'd seen . Presently the land mounted in broken scarps before her , vaguely seen in the wan bloody light of the Sun . Vast masses of shattered rock , covered with snow or capped with ice , tumbled down from the highlands . Missouri , that was what its uncouth name had been , Geelie saw , keying up her map . At this point there 'd been a great sprawling city , Kansas City by name , more populous than a dozen colonies . The parts which had straggled over the border had been mined and the once vertical scarp had collapsed . East of the line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hole that was Kansas . " Aung Charah in Tigerclaw to Geelie in Goblong Seven , " said her speaker . " Communications reports no contact . We have no report of anyone in that area . Behinders ? " Dubiously . " Unlikely . However , I am checking . Goblong Seven out . " It was three hundred years since stay-behind planetarians had been found on the mother world . Considering how bleak it now was , Geelie considered them extremely unlikely , as by his tone did Aung Charah . She cruised slowly over the tumbled mounds of snow-covered rubble that marked the old city . Kilometers it extended , and somehow Geelie found that more oppressive even than the vast expanse of riven rock behind her . She could not imagine the torrents of people who must have lived on this deck . The average Colony had only a hundred thousand . She peered into the dimness . The rubble showed as black pocks in the blood-lit snow . Presently she came to hover and pondered . Possibly she 'd seen a transitory gleam off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old city , she thought . But the color was wrong . No . She 'd seen a light . Perhaps there were commercial observers here from a different consortium - not necessarily spying on The Obstacle-Leaping Consortium . There might be many reasons why commercial observers would want to keep secret . Infra-red , she thought . The goblong was n't equipped with IR viewers , but Aung Charah had given her a pair of binox . She unharnessed and slipped into the back for them . And a few minutes later she saw a plume of light against the chill background . It leaked in two dozen points from a hill of rubble a kilometer away . Geelie got its coordinates and called Aung Charah to report . " I 'm going to go down and request permission to land . " " Of course this Missouri , is not part of our grant , " Aung Charah said . " They - whoever they are - will probably have a right to refuse . Do nothing to involve us legally . " " Hearing and obedience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , presently found a trampled place in the thin snow and kicked on her lights . Aiming them down , she saw footprints and a door in an ancient wall made of clay brick , a wall patched with shards of concrete glued together . The mound was a warren , a tumble of broken buildings run together , with forgotten doors and unlighted windows peering from odd angles under a lumpy , snowcovered roof . She sent back a teleview , saying , " I wonder if this is an observers " nest after all . " " Any answer on the universal freqs ? " " One moment . " She called , got no answer . " I 'm going to land without formal permission and bang on the door . " " Very well . " Geelie landed the goblong , leaving its lights on , and slipped into the back . She pulled her parka hood forward , drew on her gloves , and opened the door . A breath of bitter cold air entered , making her gasp . Ducking out , she started for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , to see a heavily bundled figure standing atop a pile of rubble by the wall . " Hello ! " she called . " Hello , " came a man 's voice . He was not twice as thick as a normal human , she saw - he was simply wearing many layers of cloth against the biting cold . Geelie exhaled a cloud of vapor , calming herself . So crudely dressed a man had to be a behinder - and who knew how he would react ? " I-I am Geelie of Kinabatangan Colony , a member of The ObstacleLeaping Consortium . Permission to land ? " " What ? Oh , granted . That would be you , working over there in Kansas ? " His tone was neutral , if guarded . His accent was harsh , rasping , but not unintelligible . " Yes . " " What brings you here ? Will you now begin on Missourah ? " " No , " she said . " Missourah , " carefully pronouncing it as he had , " is disputed by a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they have settled that dispute . " " That 's good to hear , " said the other , and moved . With a dangerous seeming scramble , he slid down from the rubble pile . Confronting her , he was a head taller than she , and very pale , a pure caucasoid type , in the light from her goblong . He even had the deep blue eyes once confined to caucasoids , and his beard was yellow . " Name 's Clayborn , " he said , proffering his hand . " Enos Clayborn . " She squeezed and shook it in the european fashion . " Pleased to meet you , U - er , Mr. Clayborn . " " Wo n't you come in out of the cold ? " he asked , gesturing toward the door . " Thank you . " She followed him gratefully . The bleakness more than the cold chilled her . The door opened , emitting a waft of warm air that condensed into fog . Geelie stepped in , inhaling humidity and the smell of many people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet unlike , the air of a Colony ; more people , less plants , she thought ; not so pure an air . She was standing in a vestibule with wooden walls covered with peeling white paint ; overhead a single square electrolumer gave a dim yellowish light . Clayborn fastened the door behind her and stepped past her to open the other door , gesturing her through it . Pushing her hood back , Geelie opened her parka as she entered a room full of tubs of snow , slowly melting ; piles of wooden boards ; piles of scrap metal ; shelves full of things obviously salvaged from the ruins ; an assortment of tools . Beyond this was yet another door , opening into a large , brightly lit room full of furniture and people . " Enos is ba - Enos has brought someone ! " " Enos has brought a stranger ! " " A strange woman ! " The exclamations ran through the room quickly , and a couple of people slipped out . Moments later , they and several others returned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Clayborn turned to her . " Kinabatangan Colony , " Geelie said . Old people , she thought . " Observer of The Obstacle-Leaping Consortium . " " Those are the ones mining Kansas , " Clayborn said . " Geelie tells me that they wo n't start mining Missouri " ( pronouncing it differently , she noticed ) " for quite a few years yet . " Clayborn in his mid-twenties was the youngest person in the room , she saw . The next youngest were four or five hale middle-aged sorts with gray in their hair , perhaps twice his age , and ranging up from there to a frail ancient on a couch , big pale eyes turned toward her and a thin wisp of cottony hair on a pillow . A dozen and a half at most . " How long have you been here ? " she asked , marveling . " Forever , " said one of the white-haired oldsters drily . " We never been anywheres else . " Geelie smiled back at their smiles . " I am awed that you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gloves . " This is our leader , Alden , " said Clayborn , pulling up a chair for her . " The last hundred years was the worst , " said Alden . The behinders , having overcome their shyness , now crowded forward and Clayborn introduced them . Geelie bowed and spoke to all , shook with the bolder ones . When she seated herself , one of the women handed her a cup on a european saucer . She looked at them with awe , reflecting that they must be a thousand years old . " Brown , " she heard them murmur . " Brown . Beautiful - such a nice young woman . Such beautiful black hair . " She sipped a mild coffee brew and nodded her thanks . " The last hundred years ? " she said to Alden . " Yes , it must have been . " For over nine hundred years Earth had been in partial shadow and permanent glaciation , but the Sun still shone . Then the greedy colonies broke their agreements and moved massively into the space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the shadows , and shortly thereafter they began to disassemble it . " ' Course , our ancestors laid in a good supply of power cells and everything else we 'd need , way back when Earth was abandoned by everybody else , " Alden said . " No problems there . But how much longer will the air last ? " " Oh , maybe another hundred years , " she said , startled . " Freezing it for transport is a slow process . " " And the glaciers ? They came down this way back when the Sun shone bright . " Geelie smiled , shook her head . " It 's so cold now that even the oceans are freezing over , so the glaciers ca n't grow by snowfall . Also , frankly , the glaciers were the first to be mined ; that much fresh water was worth plenty . Of course the oceans are valuable too , and they have been heavily mined also . " " The snowfall gets thinner every year , " said Clayborn . " We have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reduced to thawing the soil for water . " Geelie 's response was interrupted by the discreet beeping of her wrist radio . She keyed it on . " Aung Charah in Tigerclaw to Geelie in Goblong Seven , " it said in a tiny voice , relayed from the goblong . " Geelie to Aung Charah , " she said into it . " I have received permission to land and am with a group of native Earthers . " " Behinders , " said Alden drily . She flashed him a smile and said , " Behinders , they call themselves . " " Er - yes , " said Aung Charah , sounding startled . " Er - carry on . Aung Charah out . " " Hearing and obedience . Geelie out . " " Carry on ? " Alden asked . Geelie sobered . She had been excited and amazed at meeting these people and had not thought ahead . " Well , " she said . " He represents the Consortium and dares not commit it . You are not his problem . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Alden mildly . " More coffee ? " Geele bowed to Lyou Ye , who stood to respond , then reseated herself behind her desk and frowned . " Behinders , " she said . " They must be the very last . It 's been what , three hundred years since any have been found , that lot in Africa . " She looked sharply at Geelie . " Aung Charah is right , they 're not our problem . They live in Missouri , " however it 's pronounced , outside our grant . They 're the problem of the Missouri Compact . " " But those people wo n't settle their disputes for years , possibly decades , " said Geelie . " We ca n't just let these behinders die . " Lyou Ye glanced aside , frowning , and tapped her finger . She 'd come a long way , Geelie knew , in a short time . A very beautiful woman , ten years older than Geelie , with waving masses of dark red hair and the popular tiger-green eyes contributed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Smooth . " But she was intelligent and fully aware of the power of public opinion . " Very well , if you can find a Colony willing to sponsor them , I 'll authorize shipping to lift them out , " Lyou Ye said abruptly . " It wo n't take much , fortunately , by your description . Declining population ever since the Sun was shaded , I take it , with only this " Enosclayborn " in the last generation . They 'd have ended soon enough . You found them just in time for him , " she added . " He 's probably still a virgin . " " I 'd personally like to thank Geelie for all the time and trouble she 's put in for us , her and all her folks , " said Alden . Geelie flushed with pleasure as they applauded her . " Now , I 'll just ask for a show of hands , " Alden continued . " All them that 's in favor of flyin " off into space to a colony , raise your hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long pause . The behinders turned their faces to each other , Geelie heard a whisper or two , someone cleared a throat . But no one looked at her . Alden stood looking around , waited a bit , then finally said , " Do n't look like there 's anybody in favor of the city of Independence movin " into a colony . But that do n't mean nobody can go . Anybody that wants to is naturally free to leave . just speak to me , or to Miss Geelie here . " Shocked , horrified , Geelie looked at them . Someone coughed . Still no one looked at her . She turned a stricken gaze on Enos Clayborn . He looked thoughtful but unsurprised . And he had not raised his hand . So silent was the room that the purring of a mother cat , entering at the far side with a squirming kitten in her mouth , seemed loud . Alden turned to her . " New ideas , like flyin " space , sometimes is hard to take in , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , but still it 's a new idea . Enos , you might take the little lady back to Gretchen 's nest and give them kittens a little attention . " Enos smiled at her , and faces were turned from the cat to her , smiling in relief . " She 's bringing her kittens out , " Geelie heard them murmur . " They 're old enough for her to introduce them around . " Numbly she followed the tall young man back through the warren of abandoned passages to the warm storage room where the cat had her nest . When he evidently intended merely to play with the kittens , she said , " Enos , why - why did n't they vote to go ? " " Well , we 're used to it here . As Alden said , it takes time to get used to new ideas . " He handed her a kitten . " This is the runt - the last born of the litter . We named her Omega - we 'll give them all shots in another month or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth . " Absently she took the purring kitten , a tiny squirming handful of fur . " But you 'll all die if you do n't go ! " " Well , we 'll all die anyway , " he said mildly . " Ever notice most of us are old folks ? A lot are n't so far from dying now . They 'd just as soon die in a place they know . We 've been here a long time , you know . " " But - but - you 're not old ! And your parents , and Alden 's daughter Aina , and Camden - " " I would n't know how to act , anywhere but here , " he said mildly . He smiled down at the proudly purring mother cat . GEELIE , LYOU YE , and Aung Charah sat in the small conference room . Lyou Ye grimaced . " So that was their reaction ? I 'll admit it was n't one I 'd foreseen . All the other behinders in history agreed to go . Some of them signaled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a pillow , and nodded unhappily . " I even offered to send them to a european Colony , so they 'd be among familiar-seeming people , but that did n't help . " Aung Charah shook his head . " We 're getting a lot of publicity on this , " he said . " The newsmedia are not hostile yet . But what will they say when the behinders " refusal becomes known ? " Lyou Ye frowned . " They 'll blame us , depend upon it . Have any of them interviewed the behinders ? " Aung Charah shook his head . " They have to get permission from the Missouri Compact , which is very cautious . These planetarians have rights too . Invasion of their privacy .... " He shook his head again . " If we leave them here to die , we 'll certainly be blamed , " said Lyou Ye . " I 'm tempted to order Consortium Police in to evacuate them forcibly . " Geelie sipped her tea , looking at " Ma Kyaw . " That 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get it done , get it over with . And somebody else can pick up the pieces , clean up the mess . " Alden would certainly complain if that were done , " she said , speaking up reluctantly . " The media attention would be far worse . Violation of planetary rights ... they may even have some claim to the old city of Independence . The Missouri Compact may legally have to wait for them all to die to mine that part of its grant . " Lyou Ye grimaced again . " I suppose you 're right . " Aung Charah set his cup down . " Media criticism wo n't hurt the Consortium if we leave them here . The criticism we 'd get if we violate their rights might affect us adversely . Investors - " Lyou Ye was a " careerman . " She nodded , frowning , lips pursed . Geelie looked around the room , so unlike the comfortably cluttered warren in which Enos lived . In one wall , a niche with an arrangement of flowers , signifying This too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its conventional pattern of crows over tiny fields curving up in the distance ; the parquet floor with its fine rich grain ; the subtle , not quite random leaf pattern of ivory and cream on the walls ; the bronze samovar and the fantastically contorted porcelain dragon teapot , the only ornate thing in the room . Enos was right , she thought . He would not know how to live in a place like this . She thought of the world that was all he had ever known , a place of snow-powdered rock and brooding , perpetual night , a red-eyed Sun blown in the wind . A bare , harsh , bleak place without a future . For him , in the end , it could only mean tending the old " folks " as one by one they died , and then the penultimate generation , the generation of his parents , as they also grew old . At last he would be left alone to struggle against the darkness and the cold until he too lay dying , years of solitude and then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Lyou Ye broodingly . She looked at Geelie . " You 'll have to seduce Enosclaybom . " Geelie swept snow from a rock onto a dustpan , dumped it into a bucket . " Do n't get it on your gloves , " Enos said . " It 's a lot colder than it looks . " " How much do you have to bring in each day ? " " Not much ; I usually overdo it . I enjoy being outside . The air is clean and cold , and I can see so far . " Geelie shivered , looking around the lands of eternal night . " Does n't the shaded sun bother you ? " " It 's always been like that . " He looked around at the dim , tumbled landscape , emptying his bucket into the tub . " It 's always been like this . Okay , that should be enough . Take the other handle and we 'll carry it in . " In the vestibule they put the tub of snow in the row of tubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow here , it seemed warm and steamy after the sharp cold air outside . Still , remembering the bleak world without , Geelie shuddered . She would have moved close to Enos even if she had not planned to do so . He put an arm around her , not seeming particularly surprised . " You 'll soon get used to it yourself , " he said tolerantly . " Never , " she said , meaning it , cuddling close , her arms around him . She lifted her face for a kiss , nuzzling her breasts against his chest . Enos put his palm on her cheek and pushed her gently aside . " Let 's not start something we ca n't finish , " he said . Geelie blinked up at him , uncomprehending . " In your room-or the kittens " room - out in the passages - " Independence was a maze of warm , unused , and private passages . He cupped her face with both hands and looked fondly at her . " Thank you very much , Geelie , for your offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . But your place is in Kinabatangan , and mine is here , and we should not start something we can not finish . " The pain of rejection was like a child 's pain-the heavy feeling in the chest , the sharp unshed tears . Then came a more poignant grief-grief for all that she could not give him , that he would not take from her . " Enos ! - Enos ! " she said , and then her sobs stopped her speech . " O Geelie , Geelie , " he said , his voice trembling . He held her close and stroked her hair . ALDEN CAME AND SAT beside her in the cozy common room of Independence , where she sat watching Jackson Clayborn and Aina Alden play checkers . " You look a little peaked , " he said quietly . She slid her chair back and spoke as quietly . " I suppose so . " " Enos will be back soon enough . He 's lookin " through his things for something to fix that pump in the hydro room . Enos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . " But he was looking inquiringly at her . " Well , someone has to keep things going , " she said wanly . " Ye-ah . " Alden drawled the word out , a skeptical affirmative . " Someone does , though we got a few hands here can still tend to things . " Abruptly he said , " By your face and your attitudes , these last few days , I reckon you ai n't persuaded Enos to go with you ? " Geelie looked sharply at him . " No , " she said shortly . " I was afraid of that , " he said , low . Startled , Geelie leaned toward him . " Did you think I was fightin " you ? No , I was hopin " you 'd persuade him . God knows you got persuasions none of us can offer . We ca n't offer him nothing . " Passionately she whispered , " Then why wo n't he come with us ? All he says is that his place is here - and after that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response was slow in coming . " I suppose he ca n't say why because he do n't know how . Why he should feel his place is here , I do n't know . My place is here ; I 'm an old man . But he do n't listen to me any more than he does to you . " He shook his head . " If he stays , what 'll he have ? All he 'll have is Independence , as long as he lives - the man from the Missouri Compact explained that . That 's all . I guess , " slowly , " for him , that 's enough . " The kitten , Omega , jumped from Geelie 's arms and began to investigate the room , not having sense enough to stay away from Lyou Ye . She was " Miss Smooth " no longer , stalking about the room and visibly trying to contain her anger . " A flat refusal ! I ca n't believe he refused you . Do you realize there 've been over seven thousand Colonies offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the whole group . And we ca n't get even the young one to leave Earth ! What is wrong with him ? " " He says his place is there , " said Geelie , nervously watching the kitten prowl . " He 's been brainwashed by those old people , " Lyou Ye said . " Not intentionally , " Geelie said . " I discussed it with them , and they prefer to stay , but they would be happy to see Enos go . They know there 's no future for him there . " " And for some uncommunicable reason , he thinks there 's no future for him with us , " said Lyou Ye , more calmly . She shook her head , ran her hands through her mass of auburn hair . " I suppose he 's been unconsciously brainwashed from birth , knowing that he was the last one , that he was going to take care of them and die alone , and he 's accepted that . It wo n't be easy to break that kind of life-long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ankle and turned to Geelie . " Your tour as Observer is almost up . Would it be worthwhile to extend it and give you more time to work on him ? " Geelie put her hand to her chest . " No , " she said , and cleared her throat . " No , it would not be worthwhile . I ... can do nothing with him . " " We 'll send somebody else , but I do n't have much hope . These coldhearted euros can be so inscrutable . " Lyou Ye sat and examined Geelie . " You 're right . It 's time we got you away from Earth , " she said gently . The weather in Kinabatangan was clear and calm when Geelie returned from Earth . She pulled herself to the bubble at the axis and looked down at the tiny , idyllic fields and villages below , past the terraces climbing the domed end of the vast cylinder . She could have walked down the stairs , but took instead the elevator . At Deck level she was met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed her and engulfed her in a mass hug , all laughing and babbling at once , a torrent of brown faces . Half-floating in a golden mist of warmth , brilliant sunshine from the Chandelier , and love , Geelie let them lead her between the tiny fields and over the little bridges . She breathed deep of her ancient home , air redolent of the cycle of birth and death . They came presently to her small house in the edges of Lahad Datu . Frangipani grew by its door and squirrels ran nervously across its roof . A flight of harsh black crows pounded heavily up and away from the yard , where the tables were . They 'd spread a feast for her , and she ate with them and listened while they told her of the minute but important changes that had occurred in her absence . As she floated in this supporting bubble of light and warmth , Kinabatangan came back to her . All was as if she had never been away . Her lover had found another , in the easy way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sleep she remembered again the bleak black plains of nighted Earth , and the man who inhabited them , who had chosen to wander alone forever under a frozen Sun . She awoke and had difficulty remembering whether she was in Kinabatangan , dreaming of Independence , the half-seen land of Missouri stretching stark around it - or in Tigerclaw dreaming of Kinabatangan . She looked around the tiny room with its paper walls , its mats , the scent of frangipani in the air- she was in Kinabatangan , in her own little house , on her own mattress on the floor , and it was over . All over . Omega yawned , a tiny pink cavern floored with a delicately rough pink tongue . The kitten was curled on the other pillow . Geelie reached for her . " Oh ! You little devil , " she cried , flinging the kitten aside . Startled , Omega had bitten her hand , and now stood in the middle of the room , looking at her with slit eyes . Furious , Geelie leaped from her bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of her legs and she sank to the floor , sobbing . " Omega , Omega , I 'm sorry , s-sorry . " Grief as great as for a planet tore at her . Omega crept cautiously over and sat staring up at her , watching Geelie weep .
