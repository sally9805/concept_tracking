What did Beethoven 's symphonies sound like to Beethoven ? The composer was deaf for most of his creative life , so he heard his music in his head , but what sounds was he imagining as he wrote a score ? And what did the music sound like to his listeners , before whose astonished ears Beethoven shattered the boundaries of the classical style and thus created the foundation of the modern orchestral repertoire ? <P> In their splendid new recording of Beethoven 's nine symphonies on the Archiv label , English conductor John Eliot Gardiner and his Orchestre Revolutionnaire &; et Romantique aim to recreate the music of Beethoven as his audience experienced it . The brilliant and incisive Gardiner stands in the forefront of the original-instruments movement , whose adherents employ period instruments ( originals and replicas ) and the latest textual scholarship in order to play music as closely as possible to the way it was first heard . Having begun with the Baroque era , the movement has progressed to the 19th century . Gardiner already has a revelatory version of Berlioz 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Beethoven symphonies are his most ambitious project yet . The nine  --  which cover a technical and emotional range unmatched by the work of any other composer  --  are the bedrock of the conductor 's art , and rare is the maestro who has not committed the cycle to disk at least once . Gardiner , however , has set out to do something different with these familiar pieces . <P> We tend to hear Beethoven today as the precursor to the Romantics . Gardiner takes the opposite tack ; for him , Beethoven is the natural successor to the classical school of Haydn ( his teacher ) and Mozart . After all , Beethoven did not know Bruckner and Mahler were on their way , but he certainly did know the music of his time , and Gardiner reveals ( and revels in ) Beethoven 's links to it . In place of the weighty textures and stately pace that mark modern interpretations , Gardiner offers a Haydn-like sprightliness . <P> For the past 150 years or so , as steel-stringed fiddles and machine-tooled valve horns replaced their forebears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expense of clarity . Instruments that are perfect for late- 19th century music do not necessarily suit 18th century compositions , not even those of Beethoven , who straddles the two eras . " Later instruments have a way of blurring the edges of the music , " explains Gardiner . With original instruments , he says , " what you lose in opulence , you gain in extra transparency . " <P> Another result of the modernization of instruments is that tempos have become slower than Beethoven intended . The strings of his time simply could not sustain chords as long as the instruments of today can . Gardiner takes Beethoven 's metronome markings  --  once scorned as impossibly brisk  --  at face value . The performances are therefore far nimbler than is typical , but such is the virtuosity of Gardiner 's 60-piece orchestra that the music never seems rushed or scrambled . Listen , for example , to the famous finale of the Ninth / Symphony . The " Turkish march " usually sounds like an inappropriately comic intrusion in an otherwise profound movement . Gardiner takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , and as a result it sounds fitting , a natural outgrowth of the period 's fascination with martial Janissary music .
