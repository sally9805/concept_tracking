He was 21 years old , pitching in the big leagues and bunking with Bo Jackson . It was 1989 , and life was good for young Tom ( Flash ) Gordon , who was starting his major league career in Kansas City but thought he was in heaven . At night he would call his brothers back in Avon Park , Fla. , and brag about the adventures with his new best buddy , Bo. // In his rookie season Gordon moved in with Jackson , and he says that he will never forget the sheer luxury of Bo 's suburban mansion . " I had a Pepsi machine in my bedroom , a real Pepsi machine , " he says . " I could wake up , hit the button and  --  bang !  --  have a soda . It was awesome . " // They were small-town Southern guys who loved fishing and football , so Jackson decided to take Gordon , five years his junior , under his wing . As with his other endeavors , Jackson did not approach this task at half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gordon . Jackson bought a Chevy Blazer that he had planned to give a younger brother as a graduation present , " but my brother screwed off , " says Jackson , " so I let Tom have it . " When the rookie righthander cashed his first Royals paycheck and flashed a wad ( " about $6,000 , " Gordon recalls ) around the clubhouse , Jackson took the money , drove Gordon to a bank and helped him open an account . Gordon says it was the first bank account he ever had . " I 've still got it , " he says . " First National Bank of Kansas City . " Free to concentrate on pitching , Gordon went 17-9 with a 3.64 ERA and finished second in the American League Rookie of the Year award balloting to Orioles righthander Gregg Olson. // " Tom was a young kid , and I did n't let any of the older players mess with him , " says Jackson . " One night he was in tears after a game . I said , ' What 's wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys wo n't leave me alone . They 're always making fun of me . ' I said , ' Who ? I want names . ' And we turned around and went right back in the clubhouse . The first guy who was giving Flash a hard time , I got in his face and said , ' If Flash tells me you disrespect him again , I 'll kill you . ' " // The two had fun for a few years in K.C. , but then the world around Gordon started to change . While playing for the Los Angeles Raiders in January 1991 , Jackson suffered the serious hip injury that ended his football career and his association with the Royals , leaving Gordon to handle his own finances and buy his own Pepsis . The struggling Royals ran through a succession of pitching coaches , each of whom imparted his own philosophy to the impressionable Gordon . Off the field Gordon was left shaken by the 1995 murder of a former girlfriend who was the mother of one of his four children . When his contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 95 season , Gordon ignored the one bit of advice he got before departing Kansas City . // " One of my teammates said , ' Flash , whatever you do , do n't go to Boston , ' " says Gordon . " He said , ' You will hate it . ' I can remember coming out of the bullpen as a visitor there and having people throw beer at me and spit at me . But to me , baseball in Boston is like football in Florida . Pitching for the Red Sox is like playing tailback for the Gators. " // At least it is when you pitch the way Gordon has this season . After a successful career as a starter ( he was 73-73 in 203 starts over nine years in that role ) , Gordon , 30 , was converted to a short reliever for the last two months of the ' 97 season , and this year he has emerged as one of the top closers in the game . " He took the role and ran with it , " says Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an every-day player now . " // Says Gordon , " It 's true . I feel like a shortstop . I show up every day and feel like a big part of the team . " // He has , in fact , been the key to the success of the Red Sox this year . Through Sunday , Gordon had converted 38 of his 39 save opportunities and had held opposing hitters to a .188 batting average . He deserved some of the credit for the double-digit victory totals of starters Pedro Martinez ( 18-4 ) , Tim Wakefield ( 15-6 ) and Bret Saberhagen ( 11-6 ) , who for all their wins had only five complete games among them . In games in which Gordon had made an appearance , Boston was 53-8 . As a result the Red Sox had the second-best record in the American League ( 79-55 ) , one season after finishing six games under .500. // Even though Gordon was Boston 's Opening Day starter in ' 97 , the Red Sox were already thinking of making him their closer . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5.79 ERA  --  to the Seattle Mariners on July 31 , 1997 , Gordon moved into the closer 's role and earned a save in 11 of his 13 chances in the final two months of the season . The experience convinced him that he did n't want to return to life as a starter . " I never knew what to do with myself between starts , " he says . " I used to sit around the clubhouse and eat . Now I 'm up and excited . By the sixth inning , I want to get in the game . " // These days Gordon takes on hitters as aggressively as his old pal Bo took on linebackers . A star tailback at Avon Park High , Gordon says he turned down a football scholarship to Oklahoma State , where he would have backed up Barry Sanders . Instead , after being selected in the sixth round of the 1986 draft , he signed with the Royals . But he still feels as if he has a lot of football player in him . When Gordon 's on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and stares at the hitter as if the poor guy had scratched Gordon 's car . He looks as menacing as a 5 ' 9 " guy can . " He knows how to act like a closer , " says Mo Vaughn , smiling . // Since his arrival in the big leagues Gordon has had a vaunted curveball and an above-average fastball , but throughout his career as a starter , coaches tried to get him to develop an effective third pitch , usually some form of changeup . Once they moved him to the bullpen , the Sox viewed that as unnecessary because closers only need two pitches , especially if the pitches are as nasty as Gordon 's . " You want to know why he 's been good ? " says teammate Dennis Eckersley . " Two reasons : a 95-mile-per-hour fastball and a hook from hell . " // Mike Stanley , who is back with the Red Sox after starting the season with Toronto , caught Gordon as a starter last year and faced him as a closer this season . He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitters only see him once . " You do n't get the chance to gauge that curve when you only get up against him once , " says Stanley . " If you do n't get a chance to time him , he 's as nasty as any pitcher in the game . It 's like Roger Clemens coming out of the bullpen to face three hitters. " // When he was knocked around by the Braves in a game on June 8 , Gordon was summoned to manager Jimy Williams 's office , where Kerrigan brought a small fact to his attention . " We said , ' Hey , this was your 30th appearance and your first bad game , ' " says Kerrigan . " We want him to understand that it takes one other thing to be a good closer : a bad memory . You 're going to have bad games , and you 've got to forget them . " // While Gordon 's coaches and teammates applaud his efforts , they also know the real test has yet to come . At week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor had he served up a game-ending , three-run blast , the kind that tears a team 's heart out . In 29 of his saves Gordon had entered the game with a cushion of two runs or more . " You find out about a guy when the team is struggling and he 's had two or three bad outings in a row and the fans are wondering if the manager 's going to go to someone else , " says Eckersley . " You 've got to see how a guy handles adversity . " // Gordon has overcome off-the-field tragedy . In May 1995 Devona Strange , his high school sweetheart and mother of his now eight-year-old son , Devaris , was shot and killed by her boyfriend , Lynford Schultz . Schultz pleaded no contest to manslaughter , claiming the two were fooling around with a handgun when the gun went off accidentally ; he was sentenced to five years in prison . // Gordon now has custody of his son and says he 's still trying to help Devaris get over the tragedy . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still asks a lot of questions . " Gordon says Devaris lives with him some of the time and with Gordon 's mother , in Florida , the rest of the time . Gordon , who has never been married , has three more children by two other women and says he sees and supports them all . // " People ask me sometimes , ' How will adversity affect you ? Could you handle it ? ' " says Gordon . " Well , I think I 've been through a lot , and maybe sometimes it has affected me on the field . But now the Lord has given me a chance to start my career over . I know I 've been playing for 10 years , but in my mind this is my first year . I feel like a rookie again , and I 'm having more fun than I did the first time . "
