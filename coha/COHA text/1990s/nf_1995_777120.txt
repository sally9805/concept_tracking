Happy Marriages // Do They Exist ? // On a raw spring morning in 1991 , I shared my earliest thoughts about this book with a group of some one hundred professional women-all friends and colleagues-who meet each month to discuss our works in progress . // " I 'm interested in learning about good marriages-about what makes a marriage succeed , " I said cheerfully . " As far as our knowledge is concerned , a happy marriage might as well be the dark side of the moon . And so I 've decided to study a group of long-lasting marriages that are genuinely satisfying for both husband and wife . " I looked around the room at these attractive , highly educated women-women who had achieved success in our high-tech , competitive society and who appeared to have it all . " Would any of you , along with your husbands , like to volunteer as participants in the study ? " I asked . // The room exploded with laughter . // I felt disturbed and puzzled by the group 's reaction . Their laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to say , " Surely you ca n't mean that happy marriage exists in the 1990s . How could you possibly believe that ? " // Many of the women in the group had been divorced . Some had remarried , but a good number remained single . Some had come to feel that marriage should not be taken all that seriously . " Happy marriage does n't exist , " protested one woman , " so I 'm going to get on with my life and not worry about it . " Yet when their sons and daughters decided to marry , these same women announced the marriages with great pride and accepted heartfelt rounds of congratulations from the others in the group . No one acknowledged the apparent contradictions involved . // When I pondered the meaning of their laughter later that night , I realized I had hit a raw nerve . For many , my innocent mention of a study of successful marriages seemed to strike below the well-defended surface , bringing to life buried images of love and intimacy . For a brief moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longings , only to confront again their disappointment that their wishes had not been fulfilled . And so they had laughed , dismissing their longings as illusory-vain hopes that could only lead to sorrow . // This duality of cynicism and hope is familiar to me , as it is to millions of men and women in America today . We share a profound sense of discomfort with the present state of marriage and family , even wondering sometimes if marriage as an institution can survive . At the same time , we share a deeply felt hope for our children that marriage will endure . I do not think this hope is misplaced . // We have been so preoccupied with divorce and crisis in the American family that we have failed to notice the good marriages that are all around us and from which we can learn . In today 's world it 's easy to become overwhelmed by problems that seem to have no solution . But we can shape our lives at home , including our relationships with our children and marriage itself . The home is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world that is to our own liking ; it is the last place where we should feel despair . As never before in history , men and women today are free to design the kind of marriage they want , with their own rules and expectations . // Fortunately , many young people have not yet become cynical and are still able to speak directly from the heart . After spending some wonderful hours talking to college students about their views of marriage , I received the next day a letter from Randolph Johnson , a twenty-one-year-old senior at the University of California in Santa Cruz . He wrote : " What I want in a wife is someone whom I know so well that she is a part of who I am and I of her . Someone to fill all that I am not but aspire to be . My wife is someone not just to share a life with but to build a life with . This is what marriage is to me , the sharing of two lives to complete each other . It is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then they need not grow apart . " // Randolph speaks for a new generation that is still capable of optimism about love and marriage and " the sharing of two lives to complete each other . " He also speaks for a society that is tired to death of the war on marriage , escalating divorce rates , and the search for new partners in middle age . All of us want a different world for our children . When we 're honest , we want it for ourselves . // It is absurd , in fact , to suggest that the need for enduring love and intimacy in marriage is passe . The men and women I 've seen in twenty-five years of studying divorce begin actively searching for a new relationship even before the divorce is final . In every study in which Americans are asked what they value most in assessing the quality of their lives , marriage comes first-ahead of friends , jobs , and money . In our fast-paced world men and women need each other more , not less . We want and need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nurturing love all of our adult lives . We desire friendship , compassion , encouragement , a sense of being understood and appreciated , not only for what we do but for what we try to do and fail at . We want a relationship in which we can test our half-baked ideas without shame or pretense and give voice to our deepest fears . We want a partner who sees us as unique and irreplaceable . // A good marriage can offset the loneliness of life in crowded cities and provide a refuge from the hammering pressures of the competitive workplace . It can counter the anomie of an increasingly impersonal world , where so many people interact with machines rather than fellow workers . In a good marriage each person can find sustenance to ease the resentment we all feel about having to yield to other people 's wishes and rights . Marriage provides an oasis where sex , humor , and play can flourish . // Finally , a man and woman in a good , lasting marriage with children feel connected with the past and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important link in the chain of human history . By sharing responsibility for the next generation , parents can find purpose and a strengthened sense of identity . // These rewards take root in the soil of a strong , stable marriage . But , surprisingly , we know very little about what makes such a marriage . // As a psychologist who has been studying the American family for most of my professional life , I have observed many changes in relationships between men and women and in society 's attitudes about marriage and children . In 1980 I founded a large research and clinical center in the San Francisco Bay Area , where my colleagues and I have seen thousands of men , women , and children from families going through first or second divorces . Presently I am conducting a twenty-five-year follow-up of sixty couples who underwent divorce in 1971 , with an emphasis on the lives of their 131 children , who are now grown and involved in their own marriages and divorces. // These young men and women , whom I have been interviewing at regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce , provide unique insights into its long-term effects on the American family . I have seen a great many children who , ten and fifteen years after their parents ' divorce , are still struggling with unhappiness . On the threshold of adulthood , they are still in the shadow of that event . I am poignantly aware of how unfamiliar these children are with the kinds of relationships that exist in a happy family . Many tell me that they have never seen a good marriage . // I 'm also concerned about the many men and women who remain lonely and sad years after a divorce . I 'm doubly worried about the high divorce rate in second marriages with children , which compounds the suffering for everyone . I am sometimes criticized for being overly pessimistic about the long-term effects of divorce , but my observations are drawn from the real world . Only if you see the children and parents of divorce day in and day out can you understand what the statistics mean in human terms . // I want to make it clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how wretched a bad marriage can be and of the need for the remedy of divorce . But divorce by itself does not improve the institution of marriage . Some people learn from sad experience to choose more carefully the second time around . Others do not . Many never get a true second chance . // In the past twenty years , marriage in America has undergone a profound , irrevocable transformation , driven by changes in women 's roles and the heightened expectations of both men and women . Without realizing it , we have crossed a marital Rubicon . For the first time in our history , the decision to stay married is purely voluntary . Anyone can choose to leave at any time-and everyone knows it , including the children . There used to be only two legal routes out of marriage-adultery and abandonment . Today one partner simply has to say , for whatever reason , I want out . " Divorce is as simple as a trip to the nearest courthouse // Each year two million adults and a million children in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriages ends in divorce , and one in three children can expect to experience their parents ' divorce . This situation has powerful ripple effects that touch us all . The sense that relationships are unstable affects the family next door , the people down the block , the other children in the classroom . Feelings of intense anxiety about marriage permeate the consciousness of all young men and women on the threshold of adulthood . At every wedding the guests wonder , privately , will this marriage last ? The bride and groom themselves may question why they should marry , since it 's likely to break up . // To understand how our social fabric has been transformed , think of marriage as an institution acted upon by centripetal forces pulling inward and centrifugal forces pulling outward . In times past the centripetal forces-law , tradition , religion , parental influence-exceeded those that could pull a marriage apart , such as infidelity , abuse , financial disaster , failed expectations , or the lure of the frontier . Nowadays the balance has changed . The weakened centripetal forces no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today 's marriages , in which people work long hours , travel extensively , and juggle careers with family , more forces tug at the relationship than ever before . Modern marriages are battered by the demands of her workplace as well as his , by changing community values , by anxiety about making ends meet each month , by geographical moves , by unemployment and recession , by the vicissitudes of child care , and by a host of other issues . // Marriage counselors like to tell their clients that there are at least six people in every marital bed-the couple and both sets of parents . I 'm here to say that a crazy quilt of conflicting personal values and shifting social attitudes is also in that bed . The confusion over roles and the indifference of the community to long-term conjugal relationships are there , as are the legacies of a self-absorbed , me-first , feminist-do-or-die ' male-backlash society . The ease of divorce and changing attitudes about the permanence of marriage have themselves become centrifugal forces . // Our great unacknowledged fear is that these potent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that marriage as a lasting institution will cease for most people . We are left with a crushing anxiety about the future of marriage and about the men and women within it . // My study of divorce has inevitably led me to think deeply about marriage . Just as people who work with the dying worry about death , those of us who work with troubled marriages are constantly forced to look at our own relationships . So I have carefully taken note of my marriage and those of my three grown children . As our fiftieth wedding anniversary approaches , I have thought long and hard about what my husband and I have done to protect our marriage . Why have we been able to love each other for so many years ? Did we begin differently from those who divorced ? Did we handle crises differently ? Or were we just lucky ? What have I learned that I can pass on to my children and my grandchildren ? // I certainly have not been happy all through each year of my marriage . There have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times of ecstasy and times of quiet contentment . But I would never trade my husband , Robert , for another man . I would not swap my marriage for any other . This does not mean that I find other men unattractive , but there is all the difference in the world between a passing fancy and a life plan . For me , there has always been only one life plan , the one I have lived with my husband . But why is this so ? What makes some marriages work while others fail ? // An acquaintance of mine-a highly regarded psychologist who has done extensive marriage counseling-called me when she became engaged . She said , " I want to spend several hours with you , drawing on your experience . My fianc ? is several years older than I am and has been through one divorce . He 's afraid of another failure . I 'm thirty-eight years old and have for many years been frightened of marriage . What wisdom do you have for me based on your own marriage , which has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your many years of work with divorce ? Help me anticipate what lies ahead for Jim and me , so I can be prepared . " Her request intrigued me . What wisdom did she seek ? She did not want shortcuts or hints but a realistic vision that could guide their efforts in building a successful marriage . // Not long after her call I decided to design a qualitative study of fifty couples who had built lasting , happy marriages , couples who had confronted the same obstacles , crises , and temptations as everyone else and had overcome them . As I began setting up the study , I drew up a list of questions that would guide my inquiry . //
