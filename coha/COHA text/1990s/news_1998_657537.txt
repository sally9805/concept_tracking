<p> As fall 's TV season flickers into view , discerning viewers of new shows will quickly spot who 's expected in that front-row couch , who 's relegated to the uncomfortable chairs , and who might as well stay in the kitchen making popcorn . The winners of this year 's top couch slot appear to be men , especially those who have a soft spot for the Irish dancefest " Riverdance " and possibly the award-winning Irish novel " Angela 's Ashes . " To wit , 11 new prime-time shows target guys : " The Army Show , " " The Brian Benben Show , " " Buddy Faro , " " Conrad Bloom , " " DiResta , " " L.A. Doctors , " " Martial Law , " " The Secret Lives of Men , " " Sports Night , " " Vengeance Unlimited , " and " Wind on Water " ; plus there are three Irish family shows : " Costello , " " To Have &; to Hold , " and " Trinity . " Perched on a cushion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gals struggling to raise a child or brother ( " Brother 's Keeper , " " Guys Like Us , " " Holding the Baby , " " Jesse , " " Two of a Kind " ) . Sliding into those side seats is the African-American viewer who floats between the inner city and the suburb ( " The Hughleys , " " Living in Captivity " ) , or who 's got a quirky sense of black history ( " The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer " ) . The supernatural buffs can stay in the room ( " Brimstone , " " Charmed , " " Cupid , " " Fantasy Island " ) , as can the high-tech/sci-fi fans ( " Mercy Point , " " Seven Days " ) . The kitchen will be a bit crowded this fall as women and families find individual shows tailored to them ( " Maggie Winters , " " Two of a Kind " ) . As TV history has shown , however , quantity does n't necessarily beget quality . A few shows with early indications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends . * The WB 's Felicity , a coming-of-age drama about a college-bound innocent , has been singled out by critics for its thoughtful writing and worthy performances . The best thing about this show is the respect and affection it demonstrates for young people in search of themselves . * Also on the WB , the engaging drama Hyperion Bay is a little more intelligent , a little more sensitive to the issues of the twenty- and thirtysomethings who struggle to make sense of their lives . A high school nerd becomes a successful businessman and then returns to his languishing hometown in hope of reviving it . * Fox , which trumped the other networks with its August premiere dates , has drawn healthy ratings for several weeks running with its retro That ' 70s Show on Sunday night - an off-kilter look at the upbringing of Generation X. * The new showcase for the familiar Olsen twins , ABC 's Two of a Kind , in the struggling-single-dad category , may not break any critical ground . But industry observers say this new show has all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single dad ca n't quite cope without the help of a wise , hip baby sitter . While it is encouraging to note that the season fairly bristles with ripened talent such as Diane English , of " Murphy Brown " success , the shows themselves are spotty . English 's new show , Living in Captivity on Fox , about a black couple transplanted in the white suburbs , has received low marks for originality and concept . A more successful show to tackle the same black-white encounter is The Hughleys . Based on the real-life experience of star D.L. Hughley , the ABC show depicts the adjustments of an upwardly mobile black family in a white housing tract . It offers a likable cast and decent writing that attempts to show the complexities of the encounter . One of the season 's most ballyhooed experiments in outrageousness could only be called an outrageous mistake . In UPN 's The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer , a transplanted black English butler chronicles scandalous shenanigans in the Lincoln White House . Crude and crass , the jokes are driven home with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faro weighs in with an unexpectedly appealing , darkly comic detective hero who 's been out of action in Mexico for 20 years . His Rat Pack-era attitudes bring a sort of **26;862;TOOLONG tone to L.A. 's contemporary fast-lane underworld . Handsomely designed and well written , private investigating has seldom been so funny , and if the show is not a mainstream success , it could easily break out as a cult hit . Cult-hit possibilities also lurk in Wind on Water , the NBC vehicle for Bo Derek 's return to the beach some 20 years after her film success in " 10 . " A " Falcon Crest " in the Hawaiian Islands , it has the obligatory family-land struggles with greedy developers . The show is really just a vehicle for the extreme sports of helicopter-jumping , snowboarding , and big-wave surfing . Along the same lines is UPN 's Legacy , a low-grade historical soap with lots of men with chiseled chins , beautiful girls and horses . CBS 's Martial Law , on the other hand , dispenses with everything but the extreme violence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The show stars a real-life Chinese martial-arts expert , Sammo Hung , as a Chinese detective working with American agents to nab drug dealers . His graceful moves are about the only thing interesting in this pedestrian cop show . Sports Night on ABC woos the male viewer , too . It may sound like a sports show , but it 's really about the television newsroom . With a great cast , above-average writing , and a fresh approach to the sitcom ( the pilot dealt with journalistic ethics and finding meaning in one 's work ) , it could prove one of the season 's invigorating successes . If the rest of the segments are just as gripping , women are likely to find this show intriguing . Another newsroom show , CBS 's The Brian Benben Show , also deals with journalistic ethics but in a more superficial , cynical way . Benben is an appealing performer , but the tone leaves a sour taste . Taste may be the make-or-break factor in another high-profile show in which vulgar language and behavior may be so off-putting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox , based on the life of stand-up comic Sue Costello , is set in South Boston and is one of the shows that pick up on the current interest in all things Irish . The characters are likable , although Costello has an unfortunate habit of delivering her punch lines with a smirk . The dramatic entry in the Irish Sweepstakes , NBC 's Trinity , is a slogging New York-based family melodrama full of every cultural cliche - a cop , a priest , an alcoholic , a sinning daughter , and a mother with an endless supply of boiled potatoes on the table . A much better contender is To Have &; to Hold , a Boston-based CBS show in which the writing is livelier and the situations are more appealing . A conservative Irish cop marries a liberal public defender , and more than cultures clash in their two approaches to the law . Will &; Grace , on the other hand , is about how people get along . Picking up where " Ellen " left off , the Monday-night NBC show revolves around a close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for Encore ! Encore ! , it has the irresistible charms of Nathan Lane , Joan Plowright , and slightly less so , Glenne Headly . The writing could be less predictable but Lane is so much fun to watch it does n't matter . A better choice on NBC 's Monday-night lineup is Conrad Bloom . It concerns a man whose many female friends and relations depend on him - and he likes holding the world together for them . And there are plenty of moments of promise in Jesse , which makes a matched set with " Conrad " since Jesse is a woman who holds the world together for her male friends and relations . The charming comedy , taking up residence on NBC 's closely watched Thursday-night lineup , stars " Married ... With Children " veteran Christina Applegate as a single mom . Another thematically linked duo of shows is " L.A. Doctors " and " Mercy Point . " Mercy Point , UPN 's future-space opera with a medical setting ( " ER " in outer space ) , showcases the wonderful Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not headed for mainstream appeal , the show has all the makings of a camp cult classic . Unfortunately , back on Earth , CBS 's L.A. Doctors is a predictable , artificial , if well-intentioned , medical drama . But while all these shows are basically about human mercy , a show like Vengeance Unlimited is a ghastly advocate for vigilante justice . A man contacts people who have experienced terrible injustice and wreaks vengeance on their enemies in exchange for certain favors . Sensational and vapid , the ABC drama appeals to the basest emotions . And while The Army Show on the WB may not be as bad , the inane antics of this bunch of self-conscious wackos succeed only at insipid vulgarities . Mean spirits pervade the slight Secret Lives of Men , starring Peter Gallagher , about three divorced guys trying to manage life after marriage . The King of Queens is another lightweight comedy with another put-upon hero , a nice working-class guy whose in-laws take advantage of his kindliness . They are crass as well as callous . In fact , the only envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " vulgarity . " There is a lot more bad language and not the slightest diminishing of cheap libidinal humor . But to be fair , many of the male characters this year are a lot more responsible to their loved ones than in recent TV history . Maybe all those single dads , married men , and loving sons are meant to reinforce the virtues of stability and accountability - and bring those women and children out of the kitchen after all . <p> * Gloria Goodale 's e-mail address is : goodaleg@csps.com * M.S.
