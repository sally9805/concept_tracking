WHEN the World Economic Forum recently released its annual rankings of the world 's most competitive economies , Japan had fallen from the top of the heap to third place , behind the U.S. and  --  of all places  --  Singapore . Curiously , the news hardly caused a ripple among business leaders in Japan , other than bemused surprise that the economic superpower had n't fallen further in the prestigious rankings . This anomalous reaction offers a useful lesson not only in better understanding the Japanese but also in accurately assessing Japan 's true competitive position in the world economy of the future . That 's because Japan , for all its discipline and heady accomplishments , is at heart a nation of worrywarts . Salarymen worry about what their bosses and peers will think if they leave the office before 8 P.M. Japanese mothers fret over whether their dimpled kindergarteners will get into the right university . Old-timers carp about the corrupting influence of the West on Japanese culture . College students fear there wo n't be enough jobs for them when they graduate . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compares with  --  and competes with  --  the rest of the world . So when economic times turn tough , the country tends to fall into a national funk that can belie the reality of the situation . The recent 40-month " post-bubble " recession has been particularly unnerving , especially when you throw in the uncertainties caused by a yen that has swelled in value by 20% this year alone , and by nearly 50% since 1990 . Technically , however , the slowdown did n't even qualify as a full-blown recession-annual real GDP never actually contracted-except during a few especially bleak quarters ( see chart on page 122 ) . chart omitted Still , to hear all the dire pronouncements of business and government leaders , economists , journalists , and pollsters over the past 18 months or so , one would think Japan 's economy was in intensive care  --  that Japanese consumers had forever lost the joy of spending , that many of Japan 's industrial titans were about to gush red ink , that Tokyo 's big banks would drown in a sea of bad loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its hallowed tradition of lifetime employment . One would be wrong . Sure , the Japanese have been down for a while , but do n't make the mistake of counting them out . " It is the Japanese way to hit the panic button early , " observes James Abegglen , chairman of Gemini Consulting in Tokyo , who has witnessed Japan 's economic ups and downs firsthand for nearly 40 years . " The truth is , this recession really has n't been that bad . It 's made everybody breathe a little harder . But only now are the Japanese beginning to realize that the main impact has been on marginal parts of the economy that probably should n't survive in their present form anyway . Nevertheless , the real engines of the economy are still firing and probably will emerge stronger . " LATELY , in fact , Japan seems to have experienced an epiphany of sorts , or at least a mood swing . Call it the New Realism . More than a mere collective sigh of relief after the almost imperceptible bottoming-out of the recession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pragmatic vision of what Japan 's economy can and can not do , and what Japanese businesses must accomplish on their own to remain competitive . In both words and actions , Japan 's CEOs , consumers , and even government bureaucrats have finally begun to accept and embrace an economic vision that portends a whole new ball game for the tradition-rich Japan Inc . Much of the New Realism would seem familiar to those who have lived through the paroxysms of the U.S. economy in recent years . Reengineering , for example , is all the rage today as Japanese companies get serious about wringing the woeful inefficiency out of their white-collar work force . Corporations are moving manufacturing operations  --  as well as more sophisticated ones  --  offshore , not merely to appease trading partners but to save money as well . Torpid consumers , long numbed by Japan 's notoriously high cost of living , are discovering the concept , so beloved in America , of value and are revolting against paying through the nose to subsidize Japan Inc. ' s export machine . Even the government bureaucrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preaching the necessity of deregulation these days . Meanwhile , Japan is waking up to another very positive reality : that being the world 's largest source of investment capital is a tremendous advantage , especially if you happen to have the world 's fastest-developing region  --  Asia  --  on your doorstep . And there 's a growing awareness that Japan 's economy , while a paragon of the old industrial capitalism , needs shaking up before it can become a full participant in the emerging new economy , at the core of which are information and services . Simply put , Japan has stopped stewing about its run of bad luck and instead is rolling up its sleeves to get back to work . As Masaru Yoshitomi , former chief economist for the Japanese government , says , " Two years ago we were blaming the government for our troubles , and this past year we 've blamed the strong yen . But today we 're still alive , and are finally learning that all these changes we face , while painful , are n't necessarily a bad thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartening , or that you can quite call the Japanese mood optimistic yet . For one thing , large segments of Japan 's industrial economy are now weaker than ever  --  steel , paper and pulp , cement , and other old-line commodity businesses . For another , under-employment is a growing problem , as hard-pressed large corporations dump more and more workers on smaller sister companies and suppliers that do n't really need them . Away from home , Japan 's trade surplus is still chafing the U.S. and other important trade partners in Europe and Asia . Back at home , there 's no sign that Japan 's overly coddled agricultural sector will be deregulated anytime soon . That 's important , because the government 's sentimental and cushy treatment of farmers since World War II has significantly distorted the whole Japanese economy by restricting land use and preserving tiny farms and inefficient production methods . These policies more than anything else are responsible for Japan 's dizzying food and land prices , and more generally for the cramped housing and high costs of living and doing business in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking hold , and it is manifesting itself in a variety of ways : * REENGINEERING IS FOR REAL . Japanese managers from all industries now recognize that the " R " words  --  restructuring , rationalizing , and reengineering  --  are downright necessary in an economy that is marbled with inefficiency . They also realize that brute manufacturing force is no longer enough to be competitive in a world economy tilting toward services and information technology . To become serious players  --  rather than befuddled spectators  --  they now know they must replicate in the office the productivity revolution they engineered on the factory floor in the 1970s and 1980s , and they see that this will require nimbleness and creativity , traits at which the Japanese have never particularly excelled . One stark example : Nippon Steel , the largest nongovernment steelmaker in the world . It 's been especially hard hit lately , losing $501 million last year alone . The recession was bad enough , but when the Japanese currency pushed below the psychologically important 100-to-the-dollar level earlier this year , company executives realized the world had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " plan that takes aim squarely at the white-collar work force . The goal is to cut $3 billion in operating costs within three years , chiefly by eliminating 40 of the company 's 10,000 administrative workers as well as 15% of its factory workers . Says Yoshiro Sasaki , executive vice president of Nippon Steel : " To put it in a word , we 're Americanizing . " Sasaki , a great admirer of the no-nonsense management style of General Electric Co. ' s Jack Welch , adds , " We have to find a better way . This rationalization is only the beginning . " What will happen to the 10,000 or so employees whose jobs will be eliminated ? Well , here the answer sounds more like traditional Japan than the New Realism . Says Sasaki : " They will either retire or move to one of our subsidiaries or suppliers . " That 's just Nippon Steel , though , where the very mention of layoffs seems revolutionary . In other , more dynamic industries , changes are afoot that were unthinkable five years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have agreed to begin sharing some common parts , and both companies also are trimming the number of models they offer and reducing design cycles from four to three years or less . Echoing Nippon Steel 's Sasaki , Minoru Nakamura , a Nissan director and head of the Asia and Oceania operations division , predicts , " This is only the beginning . Coping with the high yen has made us realize that we have many components and processes that we can eliminate to get rid of extra fat and become competitive again . " * 1HE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER . For decades Japanese industries have colonized the world , at first mainly in search of new markets . During the 1980s , however , their motive for expanding abroad became almost political as automobile and electronics companies sought to ease trade frictions by manufacturing more products and creating jobs in the markets where the goods would be sold . Today Japanese industry is transferring more production abroad to escape the high cost of doing business at home . The statistics tell the story . While Japanese electronics giants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two-thirds of those products are now made outside Japan , according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry . A third of all electronic parts  --  semiconductor chips , lasers , motors , and other key components for computers and consumer electronics  --  are now manufactured abroad , as well as 31% of all Japanese-brand automobiles and 39% of all cameras . And this year Japan will import almost as many color televisions as its own domestic factories produce . Some Japanese companies have made overseas manufacturing the centerpiece of their corporate strategies . The best example is Aiwa Co. , a consumer electronics maker 52% owned by Sony , which in the late 1980s was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy . In 1986 , Sony assigned Hajime Unoki , an international marketing specialist who once was the personal assistant to Sony co-founder Akio Morita , to rehabilitate Aiwa . Says Unoki : " I realized from the very beginning that a we wanted to be a low-cost competitor in the 1990s , we eventually needed to be sheltered from the yen . The only way to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So Unoki closed three of Aiwa 's five Japanese factories , laid off 1,000 workers , and converted the remaining domestic facilities into a product design center and a plant for developing flexible manufacturing processes . Unoki then went to Singapore and leased some cheap factory space from an old friend to begin his experiment . Since then Aiwa 's growth has been phenomenal , especially in the context of a nagging recession that has pummeled the rest of the Japanese consumer electronics industry . Annual sales have more than doubled since 1989 , to more than $2 billion , and profits have swelled nearly 20-fold , to $45 million . Now 5,000 of Aiwa 's 8,000 employees live overseas  --  in Singapore , Malaysia , and Wales  --  where the company makes 78% of its products . The 3,000 employees back home concentrate mainly on product and process engineering and marketing . The spreading diaspora of the Japanese automobile industry is driven by the same economic realities . Companies such as Toyota , Nissan , and Honda now all are focusing the bulk of their capital spending overseas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , the company recently announced plans to increase North American vehicle output by 50% and to double engine production there by 1996 . And it has hinted at investing in China in a big way . Not all the Japanese forays abroad involve manufacturers trying to escape high costs ; service giant Japan Airlines , for example , hit on a clever  --  and by Japanese standards , revolutionary  --  solution to its business difficulties . The 1990s have been a nightmare for Japan 's flagship carrier . Lucrative business traffic plummeted during the recession , and the incredible swelling yen only made things worse , driving up the airline 's costs relative to other international carriers . The company estimates that in dollar terms , its operating costs have grown by 88% since 1982 , vs. 27% for American carriers , with most of that increase coming in the past three years . But traditional lifetime employment policies made it impossible to lay off flight crews , and Japan 's Ministry of Transportation frowned on other schemes to reduce shifts . Then last year Jiro Sagara , a Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidestep the regulators . Since 1990 , Japan Airlines had operated a subsidiary called Japan Air Charter , of which Sagara is also president . From the beginning , Japan Air Charter was intended to be a low-cost carrier , and had hired foreigners  --  mostly American pilots and Thai flight attendants  --  to staff cockpit and cabin crews at one-third the salaries of their Japanese counterparts at the parent airline . Sagara realized that , with some fancy footwork , the charter crews and aircraft could also fly conventional , scheduled routes for the parent company at a substantial savings . Today the charter company  --  which has ten aircraft , all painted in a colorful , hibiscus-flower motif  --  flies most of Japan Airlines ' regularly scheduled routes between Japan and Hawaii . On average , the charter company 's total operating costs are 8% lower than those of the parent company , largely because of reduced labor costs , and those savings drop right to the bottom line . By 1997 , Sagara hopes that the charter company will have 1,000 foreign employees and will account for 20% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies move additional manufacturing operations overseas , the Japanese have something new to worry about : Is Japan 's industrial base hollowing out ? No , says Donald V. Kimball , senior economist for Mitsubishi Bank . " I would call what is happening industrial angioplasty rather than hollowing out . The production that 's moving overseas probably belongs there . " And the statistics indicate that Japan still has a long way to go before it has a big problem . According to MITI , in 1993 only an estimated 6.4% of Japan 's total manufacturing production came from its overseas operations , compared with 27.5% for the U.S. Moreover , despite the onerous costs of doing business in Japan , some industries , especially those that make high-tech products requiring lots of skilled labor , will almost certainly stay home . Says Fumio Sato , president of Toshiba : " Where speed , technology , and constant improvement are necessary to a product , Japan is still the best place to operate . " Indeed , both Toshiba and its arch-rival NEC have recently announced or completed billion-dollar computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most advanced in the world . * THE DEREGULATION DILEMMA . As Japan 's manufacturing behemoths move more and more activity offshore , even the stodgy control freaks in the government bureaucracies are beginning to talk openly about accelerating long-overdue deregulation of the economy to help reduce the costs and frustrations of doing business in Japan , as well as to ( gasp ) lure in more foreign direct investment . About time , says Corporate Japan . The New Realism has emboldened business leaders to drop their customary oblique politeness and rail against the government regulators whom they blame for undermining Japan 's competitiveness . As one executive put it , " Japanese industries are adults now , but the government still thinks we need babysitters . " Kazuo Nukazawa , managing director of Keidanren , Japan 's leading business council , states it even more bluntly : " Our view on deregulation is quite clear . If the government does n't deregulate our financial markets , our telecommunications system , our distribution systems , our retailing laws , our labor policies , and our product standards , we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be getting the message . Yasutaka Nagatani , director of MITI 's international business affairs division , says : " We have to restructure the economy to eliminate the price and cost differential between Japan and the rest of the world . If we do n't deregulate , only the protected and regulated companies will remain , and we do n't want that . " When the government has loosened its grip , even only slightly , Japanese businesses have pounced on the opportunity . International Telecom Japan is the child of one such move , the halting attempt by Japan 's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to open up Japan 's international telecommunications businesses . The company , which provides international telephone and data transmission services and is loosely modeled after MCI and Sprint in the U.S. , already is raking in billions of dollars in revenues and showing a profit , despite huge startup costs . It is also a prototype of the new kinds of business relationships that will be possible under the New Realism : Its shareholders are an unlikely consortium of some of Japan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other markets are the fiercest of competitors . Says Hiroshi Ohara , president of ITJ : " The recession has had no effect at all on our business plans . In fact , the higher yen has stimulated international telecommunications traffic because travel budgets are being cut . Our whole pie is growing 10% a year , so I 'm a happy man . " Much of the pressure for deregulation is coming , for the first time , from Japanese consumers . Shoppers , for example , are forcing the de facto deregulation of much of Japan 's retail marketplace with their newfound price sensitivity . The recession is partly responsible for this growing cost-consciousness , as is the increasing worldliness of the Japanese . But what has really opened consumers ' eyes is a tsunami of inexpensive , high-quality imported goods , made even cheaper by the strong yen , that is washing , up in Japanese stores . Suddenly , consumers have awakened to the realization that they have been gouged for decades by protective regulations that compelled them to subsidize the profits of the Japanese producers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers , distributors , and retailers , forcing the dismantling of inefficient , 19th-century distribution and retailing methods , and thus slowly unsnarling Japan 's tangled retail marketplace . Newly opened discount centers ; warehouse stores , factory outlets and mail-order outfits  --  including such U.S. merchants as Toys " R " Us and L.L. Bean  --  are thriving , while traditional department stores have seen sales fall for three consecutive years . * THE BOTTOM LINE . So what does the New Realism really mean for Japan 's international competitiveness ? Kenichi Ohmae , former chairman of McKinsey &; Co. ' s Tokyo office and the founder of a group advocating sweeping economic and political reforms , thinks it will take some time for Japan to find its sea legs again . Says he : " What is happening in Japan now parallels what happened in the U.S. in the 1980s . Our industries are learning how to be competitive again . Some parts of Japan Inc. will survive and thrive , and other parts will fall apart or move abroad . But that wo n't be the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry is less competitive than it was in the 1980s . But there 's evidence that the kingpins of Japan 's industrial economy  --  namely makers of automobiles , electronics , machinery , and specialty chemicals and materials  --  are probably stronger than advertised and are poised to jump on any real surge in business activity at home or abroad . One big reason : All the excess manufacturing capacity Japan built during the reckless bubble years of 1987-90 , which has been mostly an albatross , could enable Japan to come roaring back almost instantly when demand picks up . And once that plant capacity is utilized , Japan 's productivity , and , accordingly , its competitiveness , will improve sharply . Judging from the projected growth rates for Asia , the U.S. , and Europe , that could well happen . Indeed , Nomura Research Institute predicts that corporate profits , which have been slumping by more than 22% a year for the past two years , will slip by less than 1% this year and rebound by 23% in 1995 , largely because of anticipated improvements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economist , warns that it 's unwise to generalize about Japan 's industrial competitiveness . He pulls out a computer printout he 's been tinkering with to demonstrate how " it 's a different story with each industry . " The spread sheet shows the strongest value of the yen under which each of ten broad industries could post a profit . According to Yoshitomi , Japan 's electronics and chemical industries are the only ones that could remain competitive if the yen falls well below 100 to the dollar . Makers of automobiles , precision instruments , and cameras would be comfortable if the yen were somewhere between 110 and 120 to the dollar . All remaining industries  --  most of them old-line commodity suppliers or makers of basic materials  --  simply could n't cut it even if the yen slipped to 150 yen to the dollar , at least not without draconian restructuring , consolidation , and genuine downsizing . The weakest industry of all turns out to be the most protected one  --  agriculture  --  which would require an exchange rate of 305 yen to the dollar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the value of the yen is the biggest wild card in Japan 's struggle to regain its competitiveness . Since so much of Japan 's economy is export-oriented , a suddenly stronger yen takes its toll on corporate bottom lines almost instantly , and without warning . ( Toyota notes that the milder 9% appreciation of the yen last year denied it $1.6 billion in profits . For perspective , that sum is equal to the total worldwide profits PepsiCo reaped in 1993 . ) Japan was especially shocked that the yen would strengthen as much as it has in the midst of a recession . But it did , and that set the recovery back by at least a year . The problem is that the exchange rate is the one thing the New Realism ca n't really influence . Even so . various economic think tanks believe the yen has probably reached its highwater mark for now . Nikko Research Center predicts that the currency , which is hovering at about 99 to the dollar now , will rebound to an average of about 110 next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have its work cut out for it , but most key industries will at least break even . If Japan has an ace in the hole , it is Asia . According to MITI , Asia now soaks up 18'b of Japan 's annual foreign direct investment , compared with 12% in 1989 , and that percentage is certain to grow . It 's hard to take lightly all that Japanese investment capital  --  the world 's largest stash . ( During the recession , the Japanese rank and file , long considered almost pathological savers , have been socking away cash like never before . ) Consequently , Japanese banks and companies have the resources to play a central role in financing the enormous industrial infrastructure of railways , airports , industrial parks , and power plants going up in Asia . That , in turn , will trigger more demand for some of Japan 's signature , high-value products and services , such as power generation equipment , heavy-duty motors , trains , construction , and the like . Says Kenneth Courtis , senior economist for Deutsche Bank Capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chips on the table always has a big advantage , and right now Japan is about the only player with all the chips  --  lots of capital , technology , and manufacturing skills , and world-class companies that know how to use them . Over the long term , all of that investment capital will ensure that Japan 's technologies and manufacturing skills , coupled with the Overseas Chinese knowledge of the markets , will fuel Asia 's development . That ultimately means more huge markets for Japanese products , and the implications of that are staggering . " So where do American companies fit into the picture ? Replies Walter Shill , a partner of McKinsey &; Co. in Tokyo : " I would argue that Japan is one of the best countries in Asia for American foreign investments . Right now U.S. companies hold some real advantages  --  not just more competitive prices , but also superior management methods and a better understanding of open markets . There are real opportunities for companies that pick their targets carefully . " Just look at Ford Motor Co . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales rate in a year , and its Taurus station wagons have become something of a status symbol . Better yet , consider Apple Computer , which in recent years has built up a bigger market share in Japan than it has in the U.S. THE NEW REALISM notwithstanding , some Japanese attitudes will never change . Says Toyoo Gyohten , president of Bank of Tokyo : " No matter what happens , we in Japan do not believe the market should be a jungle . If profit maximization becomes our only motive , we will run out of control . " In other words , Japanese-style deregulation will probably result in something that only vaguely resembles a truly open market . And no , Japan Inc. likely wo n't water down its allegiance to employees , its emphasis on exports , or its clannish ways of doing business both at home and overseas . But just about everything else is fair game . Expect Japan to continue to bulk up its overseas operations , to import more , and to tackle its white-collar productivity problems in earnest . Add to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rosier world economy , and the New Realism , and you 've got an economy just waiting to get rolling again . Do n't say we did n't tell you so . <p>
