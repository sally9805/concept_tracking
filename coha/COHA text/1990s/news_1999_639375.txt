<p> COLORADO SPRINGS - Developmentally , the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs is much like a gawky adolescent - exuberant , unsettled and in the throes of a tremendous growth spurt . <p> Young by university standards , the campus opened in 1965 with 1,700 students and 4,000 books in the library . A faculty member characterized it as the " the worst academic repository on the planet Earth . " <p> " It was kind of a **31;1263;TOOLONG entity , " said Matt Coleman , senior vice president of Van Gilder Insurance Corp . in Colorado Springs and one of the leaders in the University Club , a group of business and university leaders that meets monthly . <p> During the past three to four years , though , it 's as if the water at CU-Colorado Springs has been spiked with giant doses of steroids . There 's been so much construction that the university - square-footage-wise - has doubled in size . Enrollment has steadily increased during the past four years and is expected to be up nearly 13 percent when classes begin Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than are currently enrolled - are expected to be studying at CU-Springs . New programs , including new doctoral programs in electrical engineering and computer science , are now being offered . CU President John Buechner has declared CU-Springs the " campus of the future " - an indication that the university might finally be shedding its image as a stepchild to CU-Boulder and CU-Denver . <p> Like most adolescents , CU-Springs is feeling growing pains . Funding has not matched growth , and that 's put a strain on staff and faculty . Class sizes are bigger , and though faculty members are doing more work , they are paid 9.4 percent less on the average than their counterparts at CU-Denver . <p> Some professors are leaving the university - or declining to come - because they can make double or triple the salary that is offered at CU-Springs . <p> " Every day , the price of looking at Pikes Peak goes up , " said Tom Zwirlein , past president of the CU-Springs Faculty Assembly and a finance professor . <p> Last spring , the tension on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them related to growth - came to a head in the form of a no-confidence vote against Linda Bunnell Shade , chancellor of CU-Springs . <p> On a secret ballot , 34 percent of 262 faculty said they had no confidence in Bunnell Shade , and 25 percent said they had reservations about her leadership . An outspoken history professor publicly questioned Shade 's leadership and her ability to lead the university out of what he termed " perpetual crisis . " <p> Changes in the physical facility , underfunding , lack of decent pay increases for faculty and Bunnell Shade 's leadership style led to the vote , Zwirlein said . <p> " Sometimes , she is n't this schmoozy kind of person , " he said . " The prior chancellor was a laissez-faire , kind of ' hand out the money and decide what you want to do with it ' kind of chancellor . <p> " The new chancellor is much different . She 's a builder . The president of the university hired her to be an external chancellor , and the business community loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns about where the money will come from to pay for the growth . <p> " I think we have some people who see the growth and realize they ca n't be a static community and a very dynamic community . You 've got to be out there to meet the needs of the students who want to be educated , " Zwirlein said . " But with all this growth , where 's the money to support it ? Some of our professors barely have what they need to run science labs . And now we 're going to add all these new students ? <p> " We 're like a Wild West movie set . You put up a facade to make a town and look behind it and there 's nothing but two-by-fours - that 's what we 've become , a facade . There 's a lot of brick and mortar going up , but after the brick and mortar , then what ? " <p> One of the first signs that the university was in transformation occurred three years ago with the opening of new residence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The halls have names such as Breckenridge , Vail and Monarch ( students favored Loveland and Purgatory ) and this year , all 588 beds are full . <p> " That was a hallmark event for CU-Springs , " Coleman said . " It became a real player that could be home to out-of-state people . It started moving into the university realm instead of being the college down the street . " <p> Last year , Columbine Hall , a state-of-the-art classroom building , opened . Three other construction projects are under way : a $ 29 million library expansion - made possible with a $ 4 million grant from El Pomar Foundation ; a $ 5.4 million project to renovate and expand the student center ; and an $ 11 million renovation of Cragmor Hall and Cragmor Manor - the buildings that were once used for tuberculosis patients at Cragmor Sanitarium , which later became CU-Springs . <p> Even with recent expansion , the university still occupies only a fraction of its 475 acres , which have grand views of Pikes Peak and Garden of the Gods . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and upgrades to three other classroom buildings . Eventually , the 400 acres on the western side of the campus will be developed with data , utility and phone lines . Long-range , CU-Springs wants to build more residence halls and a sports complex , said Tom Ostenberg , director of facilities planning and construction and a former project manager at Denver International Airport . <p> The new buildings are needed , Ostenberg said , to accommodate growth in enrollment . On Monday , 727 freshman , the largest class ever for the fifth straight year , begin classes at the university . Though nearly 7,000 people take courses at CU-Springs , the university receives state money based on FTEs - full-time equivalents . Every 30 credit hours represent one FTE . <p> The number of FTEs has increased for each of the past three years . In 1996-97 , enrollment jumped 1.9 percent ; in 1997-98 it jumped 11.6 percent ( the Beth-El College of Nursing merged with the University ) and last year enrollment jumped 4.6 percent . A 13 percent jump is expected this year . <p> Seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . The university is increasingly attracting students from southeastern and southwestern Colorado and the Denver area , officials said . <p> The boom in construction and enrollment puts the shortfall in funding in sharper contrast . A tremendous amount of money has been spent for capital improvements , but the operating dollars have lagged behind . When Columbine Hall opened , there were no operating dollars to pay for utilities or maintenance . CU-Springs had to scramble to find $ 330,000 , eventually finding the money in the budget for the president 's office . <p> To compound the problem , the state provides money based on last year 's FTE count - not this year 's . <p> " That 's problematic for a fast-growing campus like ours , " said Cleve McDaniel , vice chancellor for administration and finance . " We 're always a year behind on portions of resources to handle the growth . " <p> Last year 's growth , for instance , netted the university $ 872,100 in additional funds , but the university wo n't see that money until this year . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror , " said Rocky Scott , the Springs ' economic development guru . <p> With a limited amount of money available from the state , CU-Springs will have to build partnerships with the private sector and rely on alumni for gifts . Creating a strong scholarship program is imperative . <p> Coleman said that practically every week , businesspeople and university officials talk about how to raise more money for scholarships to attract the best students . If a high school valedictorian seeks a $ 10,000 scholarship from CU-Springs , chances are the money wo n't be available . <p> " This university does not have that resource - it does not exist , " Coleman said . <p> There are signs , however , that the university is becoming more successful in building public-private partnerships . The $ 4 million gift from El Pomar is the best example , and three years ago , the Kremer family donated 640 acres valued at $ 2.24 million . Scott Oki , one of the founders of Microsoft and a CU-Springs graduate , provided proceeds from shares of Microsoft stock valued at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in honor of the CU-Springs computer-science professor . <p> Hewlett Packard donated equipment valued at more than $ 200,000 to the math lab ; Quantum provided $ 25,000 in funding for Inroads Scholarships for minority engineering students ; and MCI provided $ 55,000 for engineering scholarships . <p> " It is essential that the community find its way around insufficient state support , " Scott said . <p> The Foundation for Colorado Springs ' Future , of which Scott is a member , has embarked on an effort to develop a communitywide strategy to expand the resource base for higher education in Colorado Springs . <p> Zwirlein said the community " supports us pretty well in words , but I do n't know if they support us well in action . The people who work to raise money for the university say this is a hard beat to work . <p> " What we need more of is discretionary money to put our hands on and use it as we see fit , " he said . " We need serious money for scholarships , so at the margin , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He said he thinks the university must continue its effort to establish public-private partnerships , and he thinks the business community and voters should pressure lawmakers to seek more state money for CU-Springs . <p> Despite the growing pains and the no-confidence vote last year , Zwirlein said he thinks the university is headed in the right direction . <p> " I personally think that when Linda ( Bunnell Shade ) is done and moves on to her next job , someday history will respond very favorably to what she did .
