On the redemptive pain of loving the natural world // The light of the body is the eye : if therefore thine eye be single , thy whole body shall be full of light. /But if thine eye be evil , thy whole body shall be full of darkness . - Matthew 6 : 22 &; 23 On certain nights when I was a boy , I used to lie in bed in the dark , unable to sleep , because of eyes-staring , glowing eyes , arrayed in a sphere all around me . The eyes seemed to be alive , though they were not visibly attached to bod ies or to faces . They were not , so to speak , attached to emotions either : they conveyed no menace , no affection , no curiosity , no consternation . They simply watched me with a vigilance as steady and beautiful as the shining of stars at night . Because their beauty was so evident , the eyes would not have troubled me were it not for this : I could not escape them . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were open or shut ; they could , in other words , move with me from the real into the imaginary world . I was in awe of this power . My mother and father , the moon and the sun , the entire world , would vanish when I closed my eyes . But the eyes in the sphere would not . And I did n't even know whose eyes they were ! I wanted very much to find out . I told my big brother about the sphere and asked if he 'd ever seen such a thing . His reply was confident but not too consoling : he laughed and told me I 'd flipped my lid . I tried my mother . She , too , laughed . " What an imagination ! " she said . I let her know , with reluctance , that I did not consider the eyes imaginary . " If they 're not imaginary , " she said , laughing no longer , " you should ask Jesus to make them go away . " I did ask Jesus . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke of them no more , I was glad that this was Christ 's response to my prayer . The sphere of eyes had never threatened or damaged me . It was intense . It was beautiful . Why should I want it to go away ? That no one but I seemed to see such things-this was a worry . But the sphere 's sudden appearance in bedtime darkness felt like a wonder out of some old myth or fairy tale , and I wanted my life to feel like that . So , much as I wanted to know more about the eyes-who they belonged to , what they wanted of me-I quit worrying and let them blaze away . I really had no choice . And in ancient tales the young heroes are patient . I tried to be the same . In late winter , when I was ten , I made perhaps my first conscious connection between the mysteries of the inner life and those of the outer world . It happened on a long hike through a doomed suburban forest , when I spotted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a towering , seemingly unclimbable cottonwood tree . Partly to dumbfound the older boys I was with , partly out of incomprehensible yearning , I began shinnying up the limbless lower trunk . Ninety or so feet later , I was clinging to tiny branches just under the massive nest and two magnificent great homed owls were circling the treetop within twenty feet of me . Circling and staring-till somewhere inside I felt it : the sense of a sphere . Vigilant , unreadable eyes , watching . Me at the center . . . The nest was so wide that there was no way to climb , or even to see , up into it , so I reached into it with a bare hand . I learned later that had it contained owlets I would have been attacked , and possibly killed , when the adults knocked me out of my precarious perch . But though their orbit of the tree became tighter and they began to let out quiet cries , the owls did not attack : as luck would have it , my groping hand found not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mixed motives-bravado , yearning , a pagan fantasy to possess my own magnificent bird-I stuck one egg in my coat pocket , then shinnied back down the tree . The boys below greeted me with everything a conquering hero could hope for : praise for my climbing , awe of my defiance of the adult owls , envy of my prize . " You crazy asshole ! " one of them kept saying , in a way that made clear his desire to be thought the same . But seeing the mother owl return to the nest , knowing the egg beneath her was now destined to be raised alone , the word " crazy " struck me as too kind . I was just a garden-variety asshole . I 'd done something stupid , knew it , and knew I lacked the strength and courage to climb the tree again and undo what I 'd done . I tried to make amends in a more arcane way : leaving my friends and their embarrassing praise , I trudged home through the woods , keeping a warm hand around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft towel , and a lamp with a flexible neck , wrapped the egg in the towel , bent the lamp over it , and began trying to convince myself that I had created a viable nest . To my amazement , the egg was convinced : that night it began to hatch . And the next morning my mother , knowing real education when she saw it , let me stay home from school to watch . It was a surprisingly arduous process . From first crack to full emergence took twenty hours : eggs , to judge by this one , are no easier to escape than wombs . The owlet was four inches long , naked and exhausted , its pink flesh blurred by an outlandish aura of slush-colored fuzz . Its eyes were enormous but covered with bluish skin : no staring , no sense of the mysterious sphere this time . In fact , I 'd never seen a pair of eyes look less likely to open or to see-for I was their adoptive mother . The owlet rested briefly after breaking free , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the conviction in its body language , I telephoned the zoo , reached its bird keeper , received a scolding for my nest robbing and a prediction of doom , but still proffered the tweezered egg and hamburger and eyedroppered milk that the keeper recommended . And again , to my amazement , the owlet responded . It enjoyed my cooking , it suffered my touch , it responded to my mothering precisely long enough to make me love it . Only then did it proceed to die . Even at birth , horned owls are tough : it took a full day to stop eating , two days to stop begging , another half day to stop writhing and die . What did not die-what lives in me even now-are the circling , vigilant eyes of the parent owls . The eyes that I betrayed . Vigilant , glowing eyes , arrayed in a sphere all around me . . . Even to mention such a thing puts me-both as a storyteller and as a character in my own story-in way over my head . Yet if deeper truths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no way to reach them without some risk of drowning . There I 'd lie , then , once in an unpredictable while , year after boyhood year , surrounded by eyes . Eyes that always appeared after the room was dark , the house quiet , and I lay still , yet far from sleep . They did not appear by opening ; they simply eased into visibility the way stars do at dusk . They never blinked , never retreated , never glanced to either side . They watched me , period . By no other eyes have I ever felt so purely perceived . In appearance they were distinctly nonhuman . They reminded me a little of angels , a little of owls , and a little of wild animals whose eyes are suddenly lit by the headlights of passing cars . They varied in size-or else stared at me from varying distances . They varied in color too . I recall shades of green , yellow , orange , all of which seemed wrong for angels . It also seemed angelically wrong , but beautifully so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes in the sphere would array themselves not just in front of me but above , below , and behind me . What I mean to imply is a physical impossibility . The sphere of eyes was visible in all directions . In its thousandfold presence I became a point of pure perception suspended inside an encompassing globe . For a long time I drew no conclusions from this ; I merely basked in it . As I grew older , though , I realized that I must see the sphere not through physical eyes , or even through my mind 's eye , but through an eye that I had n't been aware of possessingan eye that could see in all directions at once . Nothing else on earth had enabled me to see in this way . Nothing else had ever watched me in this way . So no matter how many times the sphere came , I felt awestruck by its arrival . Awestruck and compelled , no matter how late the hour , to stare back . But to be surrounded and stared at creates an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something enormously good or bad always seemed about to happen . And suspense is exhausting . So it was always I who lost consciousness and left the eyes staring at no one . Until , one winter not long before adolescence , I realized that for weeks now , or perhaps months , the vigilant sphere had ceased to visit . I 've seen nothing like the sphere of eyes since boyhood . But I 've described my recurring vision ( or pathosis ) for a reason : I have continued now and then to encounter actual bird eyes-like those of the circling great horned owls-that have suddenly struck me as living refugees of that mysterious childhood sphere . I 've even begun , thanks to these ongoing encounters , to suspect that the sphere , though unseen , might in some way still surround me . . . In 1968 , just days after receiving my first driver 's license , I am driving through a small town in a nighttime line of commuter traffic when I see , in the headlight beams of the car ahead of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The car does not slow as it drives over the ball . Seeing no kids at the curb , I , too , choose not to slow . Then the ball rolls out from under the car in front , appears in my own headlights , and I see that it is not a ball but a balledup screech owl . It is uninjured but blown off its feet . And having failed to slow , I now have no choice but to straddle it . It stares straight into my headlights , eyes glowing as I take aimand I feel myself fall , once again , into a watched center , feel something very good or bad about to happen . Then it does . Just as I pass over , the owl catches its balance , gathers itself for a leap into flight , and I feel-in the soles of my feet , in my legs , and all the way up my spine-the fatal thud of its head against the bottom of my car . I see , in the rearview mirror , the epileptic thrashing and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , run it over , and the next and the next . I do not go back . I already knew that I can revere a creature , mother a creature , want nothing but to love a creature , yet still kill it . I also know that what ca n't be killed-what will remain inside-is that moment 's glowing contact with its eyes . Highway 101 , Tillamook County , Oregon . Again alone in a car , on the bridge over Beaver Creek , I turn toward the railing and see a solitary snipe ( Gallinago gallinago ) . My field guide calls the snipe " a secretive bird of . . . , marshes , and sodden fields . " But this one is standing , calm and incongruous as a would-be bus passenger , right on the bridge 's concrete sidewalk . I immediately brakehaving learned the necessity of this from the brown ball years before . But as I pass by the snipe does n't fly , does n't even flinch . Knowing that something is n't right , I pull over , walk back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hoping it wo n't flush out in front of a passing car . It watches me . I move in close , cup it in my hands . No struggle . The snipe just stares . I stand it in my palm . Free to fly , the bird stays , a child 's dream-the wild creature you can pet-come true . I stare at it . It stares at me . Cars come and go . The bird radiates warmth . My hand returns it . The sphere closes around us . It is the peace of the sphere itself , I believe , that keeps me from seeing for so long that the entire top of the bird 's skull is gone . I carry the snipe under the bridge , sit cross-legged by the creek where no one can see me , and stand it again in my palm . I then begin trying to concoct a rite that will remove the treachery from a mercy killing . I start with simple admiration : the camouflage plumage , sabre-shaped tail feathers , earth-probe bill , black pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wide-open estuaries , I have come upon many a Gallinago gallinago , and the memorable encounters have all been the same . Silent and unseen , from very high in the sky , a lone snipe drops into a dive , builds up great speed , and , as it nears the ground , veers . This veering is their magic : it turns the tail feathers into drumsticks and the sky into a taut skin that explodes in an impossibly loud sound known as " winnowing . " A nineteenth-century ornithologist likened the snipe 's winnowing sound to " the cantering of a horse . . . over a hard hollow road . " An accurate description , as far as it goes . But the terror of these horses , when you 're alone on a misty estuary , is that you 've no hint of their existence till they 're suddenly riding down on you out of empty grayness . I congratulate my snipe , as part of our death rite , on its ability to terrify . I sing to it , stroke it , beg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubbling in the hopeless wound , watches me serenely , lets me say or do as I please . All in all , though , I feel our preparatory rite is a near perfect failure , for in admiring and stroking and singing to such a bird , love begins . It is love , therefore , that I must crush with a rock , and love that I entomb , still warm , in a little stone cairn . It is love whose two black pearls join my growing sphere . So it is love that still watches me . Never blinking . Never closing . There is a passage in Plato that wo n't leave me in peace . " The natural property of a wing is to raise that which is heavy and carry it aloft to the region where the gods dwell , " Socrates notes in the Phaedrus . Later , he says that " all are eager to reach the heights . . . but as most souls travel they trample and tread upon one another , this one striving to outstrip that . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . . . many are lamed , and many have their wings all broken , and for all their toiling they are balked , every one , of the full vision of being , and departing therefrom , they feed upon the food of semblance . " In this speech , Socrates takes for granted two things I 've always felt but have never heard a salaried American teacher mention . One is the idea that all of us in a sense " eat " with our eyes but that what we eat , thanks to our collective trampling and treading , are illusions : " the food of semblance . " The other is the powerful link between spiritual life and bird life . The natural property of a wing is indeed to carry that which is heavy aloft , literally and spiritually . And the American relationship with the wing is characterized by the shotgun , the drained wetland , and the oblivious speeding car . A second Platonic passage that haunts me , this one from the Timaeus , is an account of the origin of vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plato writes , they placed " in the vessel of the head . . a face in which they inserted organs to minister in all things to the providence of the soul . . . And of the organs they first contrived the eyes to give light . . . " Not to receive light : to give it . As the Timaeus has it , the gods made " the pure fire which is within us . . . to flow through the eyes in a stream smooth and dense . . " When the outer light of day meets this inner light that proceeds from us and the two lights " coalesce " upon an external object , the result is " that perception which we call sight . " This passage resonates beautifully with Christ 's " The light of the body is the eye . " And with Walt Whitman 's " From the eyesight proceeds another eyesight . .. " And Rumi 's " Close both eyes/to see with the other eye . " And Lao Tzu 's " He who having used the outer-light can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yet we discussed no such theories of vision in any church , school , or science camp I ever attended . The older I get , the more serious this oio feels . I was raised , like most **30;302;TOOLONG Americans , to believe that the eye works like a camera : an external light falls on an external object , glances off that object , enters the pupil ( aperture ) , alights upon the retina ( film ) , is delivered by the nerves ( mailed ) to the brain ( darkroom ) , processed instantly ( just the way we Americans like it ) , then stored in the memory ( photo album ) as an image ( snapshot ) . This metaphor works well enough as a mechanistic description of the eyeball . What we Kodak customers tend to forget is that the eye is only the instrument of sight , not the sense of it . If we focus not on how the eyeball works but on how we experience our sense of sight in action , the camera becomes a hopelessly inept model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of an extremely complex , perfectly visible sphere . There is at all times a visible ceiling or sky above us , a visible floor or ground below , and an almost infinite number of visible objects occupying a 360-degree surround . What we see of this up , down , and surround is , almost literally , nothing . Human vision is as remarkable for what it screens out , or simply fails to see , as for what it actually perceives . Our sight zooms in constantly on details , blinding us to the surround ; it pans , constantly , over the surround 's surface , giving us " the view " but no detail ; it is sidetracked , constantly , by desire , fatigue , daydreams , moods , fantasies , during which we see outward objects yet perceive them not at all . This is hardly the performance of a Kodak product . If our eyes were intended to be cameras , we all deserve our money back . Human vision in action reminds me of many things more than cameras . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( arthroscope , proctoscope , etc. ) consist of a bundle of transparent fibers through which images can be transmitted , enabling surgeons to probe the human body , focus on minuscule bits of tissue , enlarge and project these bits on a monitor , and operate on this " technologically enhanced " tissue with previously impossible accuracy . Vision , as I experience my own , is a similarly abstract , selective , and often surgical procedure-a procedure I perform involuntarily on the body of my world , with sometimes joyous , and sometimes deadly , results . Another analogy between vision and fiber-optic surgery : any fiberoptic surgical device does not merely transmit images of tissue ; it also illuminates tissue . The interior of our bodies can not be lit from outside : what a surgeon perceives through an arthroscope is therefore dependent not on external lights but on a tiny light inside the device itself . In a similar way , our perceptions of the world depend not only on exterior lights that bounce " camera-style " off of objects and into our eyes but on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within , outward , illuminating the few objects we choose to perceive . If this sounds too wild or metaphysical to describe plain day-to-day seeing , it 's a metaphysics that we all practice constantly , in perfectly mundane ways . While writing the preceding paragraph , for instance , I swiveled my eyes from the page to grab a blue ceramic coffee cup from a shelf directly behind me . En route to and from this cup my eyes moved across dozens of plainly lit objects . Yet I perceived none of them . By retracing , slowly , my eyes ' route to the cup , I see that they swept across a brass banker 's lamp , a Japanese painting of Ebisu playing a red fish on a cane pole , a photo of Meher Baba feeding a monkey , an old L. C. Smith &; Bros. typewriter , a bunnyears cactus , an almost life-size figurative sculpture , two jars full of pens and pencils , fifty or so books , and a large window . Yet I saw none of this . Something in me sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and full of hot caffeine-sought it so decisively that I turned 180 degrees , " filming " all the way , yet made an essentially blind turn . This " seeing blindness " is the great contradiction of human eyesight . Why , with our eyes open , do n't we simply see every well-lit object ? " Confusion ensues , and conflict and grievous sweat . " For we are " balked. . . of the full vision of being " and do indeed " feed upon the food of semblance . " Vision is a form of reception . But to an even greater extent it is a form of selection and projection . And what concerns me , what scares me at times , is the extent to which my selections and projections are at my command . How to see more ? How to see more clearly ? Light is a form of energy . Humans possess energy and to some extent control its ebbs and flows . Can we then aspire to control our inner light ? Can we direct the eyes ' arthroscopic procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the surgeon 's integrity , or even of his identity ? We know so little of inner light sources , speak so little of them , sound so flaky when we do , yet our seeing illuminates so little of our world ! I want to know how to aim my inner light , how to clean its lenses , how to recharge its battery . I want access to the control panel , to the joystick , or at least to the bloody on/off switch ! I want hours , innocuous hours , in which to fool with my light till I know just how and just when to aim it , and how far , high , and deep it can shine . Because without such control-without a reliable , directable inner light source-I frighten myself . For I have sometimes looked at a living object , even a beloved object , and have seen illusions , shadows , nothing at all . And still I have performed the surgery ... am haunted by a grebe . A grebe encountered and arthroscopically operated upon by my own two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the **54;334;TOOLONG rape and pillage of my homeland , the Oregon Cascades and Coast Ranges ; height of the destruction of the world I had grown up in and loved and given my writing life to ; height of an eight-year spate of Pacific Northwest deforestation that outpaced the rate in Brazil ; height of the war on rivers , birds , wildlife , small towns , biological diversity , tolerance , mercy , and beauty ; height of my personal rage ; the depth of my despair ; height of my need for light . Far from aware of this need , I took a long walk , on the first clear afternoon following a tremendous November storm , on a deserted Pacific beach-a beach beautifully wed , in the entire 360-degree surround , to my mood . The storm surf and swell were enormous . The air was a constant , crushing roar . Spindrift was everywhere . So were sand dollars , washed up by the storm as if even the ocean , in that self-absorbed era , were liquidating its inventory in the name of quick currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sun , as it sank , grew enormous and red . The stumps and my skin turned the same angry orange . My shadow grew a hundred feet long , fell clear to the high-tide line , which to my half-crazed King Learian satisfaction was a graveyard : storm-killed murres , oil-killed puffins , carcasses of gulls tangled in washed-up shreds of net , the carcass of a sea lion shot , most likely , by a fisherman who blamed it for the salmon no longer returning from a drift-netted , trawler-raked ocean to rivers mud-choked by logging . As a lifelong Oregon coast fisherman , I had a few beautiful secrets . I could , right up until that autumn , still sneak into one stream in a virgin cedar- and hemlock-lined canyon , find big , wild steelhead and salmon in a place that felt primordial , and have them all to myself . That year , however , the elk from the vast surrounding clearcutshundreds of cuts , hence hundreds of elk-had been squeezed from their once vast range into that last intact canyon . And having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day , right in the gravel tail-outs where the salmon and steelhead spawn , till they obliterated the redds , pulverized eggs and alevin , turned my secret stream 's banks into an elk-made quagmire reminiscent of the worst riparian cattle damage I 'd ever seen-a quagmire that sloughed into the little river with every rain , suffocating the salmon fry that had escaped the countless hooves . When native elk , to remain alive , are forced to wipe out native salmon , it is time , in my book , to get sad . I quit fishing , exercised my rights as a citizen , and wrote " my " Republican senators the usual letters of distress . They answered with more loads of three- and four- and five-hundredyear-old logs shipped away to Japan as if they were nosegays the senators had grown in their own D.C. flower boxes . Meanwhile , robbed of food and habitat by the same vast clearcuts , the black bears came down out of my home forest , moved into a marsh near town , and lived by raiding garbage cans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to humans , the Fish and Wildlife people came in and shot them all , six in a week . And the owl that used to sing to me mornings , attracted by the lights after I 'd written all night-the owl that scared me worse than winnowing snipes , actually , because it happened to be a northern spotted , which has an insane guffaw of a morning cry-was now a silence , a nonexistent pawn , a hated cartoon on some poor dumb logger 's cap . And in its stead , as if even the Pentagon grieved its passing , we 'd built a forest-funded graphite bomber whose stealth in flight was as perfect as an owl 's . So down the storm-smashed beach I strolled that bleak November , kicking at dead birds and drowned logging dreck , wondering what reason I still had to be grateful to live on the " scenic " Oregon coast , wondering what possible definition of " democracy " I represented through my freedom to write , without persecution or incarceration , such words as Dear Senator Packwood , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our home here is dying , the only home we have , and we 're bound by a political system in which none of the forces killing us can be stopped except through you . So please do n't get mad , do n't think this is political or personal , please know I 'm only begging for our lives when I say that our last few trees are still falling and our mills have closed and our people are sad and broke and lied to . And our schools are in ruins , our totem owl dead , and our elk jammed in a last few canyons , pulverizing our last spawning beds with hooves they 've no other place to set down , so that the salmon we cherish , salmon our whole Chain of Being needs to remain unbroken , salmon that have forever climbed these rivers , nailing their shining bodies to lonely beds of gravel that tiny silver offspring may live , they no longer come . And our bears , old honeypaws , the joy their tracks alone gave our children , they , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human ! And our kids , our voteless kids , their large clear eyes now squinting at stumps and at slash burns and at sunlight that should n't be there , squinting at Game Boys and TVs and anti-queer ads , squinting at anything rather than turning open-eyed to windows and seeing places so ancient and so recently loved , huge groves and holy salmon , clouds of birds and dream-sized animals , a whole green world so utterly gone that already they begin to believe that they only dreamed , they never reallI knew , any such blessings . . . What I knew , there on the beach , was that I 'd be writing no such letter . My politics had become raw pleas for mercy . Prayers , really . And I pray to God , thank you , not to men like Bob Packwood . I turned , tired , back to the dunes , to my car , and to the road through the clearcuts to a cold house I 'd once wept with joy to call home . But just shy of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solitary , male western grebe . And I was back in the mysterious sphere . The grebe was sitting in a curl of kelp weed at the storm 's high-water mark . His eyes , in the evening sunlight , were fire . In the center of each blaze , a black point : punctuation ; hot lava spinning round a period . A stillness , deep contact , was instantaneous . A life-and-death contract should have been , too . But-sick of humans , sick of my own impotence , sick with the knowledge of how much had been destroyed-I gazed out at the grebe through my sickness . That its body was beautiful I saw as tragedy . That it seemed uninjured I saw as irony . From studying wildlifecare books and visiting wildlife-care centers , from firsthand experience with scaups and gulls and murres , I knew that seldom do humans make a difference once a seabird washes ashore . God knew what brought this bird to this beach-hidden damage from a net , spilled oil , hidden disease , weakness from lack of food in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , I thought , if it were n't too late already . Yet , in perfect contradiction to this pessimism , I felt fear . The molten eyes , the bird 's very health and size , intimidated me . Its beak was a dagger . When I 'd move close , its neck would draw the dagger back , ready to stab . To capture the grebe I 'd have to take off my coat and smother it . The beach was cold ; the walk back would be long . Once I got it in my car it might fight its way free . Once I got it home , then what ? Light is a form of energy that flows in waves . When a healthy wave strikes an object , we see that object in what we call its " true colors . " When a lesser wave strikes the same object , we see even the truest colors as shades of gray . The sun striking that November beach was brilliant . The grebe 's eyes were two brilliances . The world was doing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to come from me , that allowed me to leave that beautiful bird where it lay . A premonition , or maybe a desire to return to the scene of the crime , brought me to the same beach three days later . I found the grebe in the same curl of kelp , very recently dead , its body , wings , and plumage still perfect , its burning eyes plucked out by gulls . This was bad enough , but months later , when I dredged up my sad tale for a bird-loving friend , he hit the ceiling . When a grebe , he told me , any grebe , is washed up on a beach like that , all it needs is to be set back in the water . Grebes require a runway of flat water to take off flying , but they do n't need to fly in order to live : even in storm surf they can swim like seals and hunt like little sharks . The grebe I 'd found was a fisherman , like me . Just as I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He was a hitchhiker , " my friend told me . " Needed a lift of a hundred yards or so . And you refused to pick him up . " Years passed , storms came and went , I walked mile upon penitent mile on those same beaches . I never saw another grebe . I only added two molten eyes to my sphere . Yet once those crimson eyes became part of me , something changed . Perception , that grebe taught me , is a blood sport . Life itself sometimes hangs by a thread made of nothing but the spirit in which we see . And with life itself at stake , I grew suspicious of my eyes ' many easy , dark conclusions . Even the most warranted pessimism began to feel unwarranted . I began to see that hope , however feeble its apparent foundation , bespeaks allegiance to every unlikely beauty that remains intact on earth . And with this inward change , outward things began to change , too . Hurrying home in my pickup , late ( as usual ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a coastal byway , noticed a scatter of loose gravel on the asphalt in front of me , and felt an impulse . There was a steep , logged-off slope above this curve . A solitary elk could have kicked such gravel onto the road while crossing . I 'm a hell-bent driver when I 'm late ; I go barreling through mud and gravel , even dodge fallen trees without thinking twice . But this time , though I saw nothing , I had that sudden sense of something good or bad impending , slammed on the brakes , and as my truck slowed from fifty to thirty to ten I was amazed , then elated , to see the gravel turn into birds . Pine siskins-a whole flock , parked right on the two-lane asphalt . I crept my bumper up next to them . They did n't fly . Maybe thirty siskins , refusing to budge from the road . Reminded me of late-Sixties college students . I got out of my truck , walked up , and joined them . I liked the late Sixties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be killed by the next vehicle to come barreling round the curve ! All but one siskin flew as I sat down next to them . The flock then circled back overhead , chirping vehemently , begging the flightless bird to join them . The siskin in the road , a little male , had been nicked by a previous car , had a small wound above his eye , was in shock . Were it not for my strange impulse , I would have massacred an entire flock of avian altruists as they huddled in sympathy around a helpless comrade . Something inside me , I realized , was wildly more aware of things than I am-two imperceptible points of molten red , perhaps . I took the wounded siskin home , kept him in my bird box overnight , drove him the following morning back to the curve where I 'd found him , and released him in perfect health . I was a happy man . That was just the beginning . I remain haunted by the grebe , but it 's been a wondrous haunting , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to flow . Not dependably ; it 's something to pray for , not something to be smug about . But I began , especially when driving , to feel a simple alertness and an occasional intuition : thousands of road miles , thousands of glimpsed roadside movements , and thousands of halfglimpsed roadside eyes began to work in concert to help me avoid killing , and occasionally even to save , a few animals and birds . I am not laying claim to supernatural skills . I still sometimes kill by accident , and the intuitions that save lives are almost all purchased , like so many mercies , with an earlier being 's innocent blood . Exactly a year after I abandoned the grebe , I was driving home down Oregon Coast Highway 101 in a torrential November rain . It was a Sunday night . A steady line of weekend storm watchers was returning to Portland in the pitch dark . The road looked like a narrow black river topped by two endless rows of insanely speeding boats . Because of the terrible visibility , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by those of the pickup in front of me . It was in the pickup 's lights that I happened to glimpse a brown ball rolling along the streaming road . I hit my brakes instantly , certain of what it was . I was also certain , because it was rolling when I glimpsed it , that it had been run over at least once already , and that the pickup would run it over again . There was time , before the truck did so , for a one-syllable prayer : I shouted , " Please ! " - terrifying my two passengers . But as I braked and pulled hard toward the highway 's right shoulder , the ball rolled out , unscathed , in the pickup 's tailwind and tailwater , then righted itself on the road as 1 shot past . It was an adult pygmy owl . I knew by its ability to regain its feet that the owl was not hopelessly injured . But it was too disoriented to escape the road . And in my rearview mirror , approaching at fifty or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of at least ten cars . Though I 'd braked as fast as I could , momentum had carried me perhaps two hundred feet past the owl . I pulled on the parking brake before my truck stopped rolling , jumped out without a word to my stunned companions , and took off running . The approaching line of headlights was maybe two hundred yards away . I could n't see the tiny owl in the dark and distance . Ten cars doing fifty , me on foot doing maybe sixteen , a living bird somewhere in between . I did n't do the math . I just ran . And how right it felt , no matter what ! How good it felt to tear eyesfirst into another November gale , straight down the lane in which a helpless bird huddled , straight into the headlights of ten city-bound cars-for in this running I 'd found a penance that might let me again meet , without shame , the crimson gaze of a grebe . I 've played enough ball to have a good sense of trajectories and distances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silhouette in the lead car 's high beams , that my hands would never reach it in time . I also knew that the lead car 's driver would n't see me or the tiny owl till he or she was upon us , and so would n't slow for either of us . I still could n't stop running . It still felt wonderful . To be an American , a lifelong motorist , and a bird lover is to carry a piano 's worth of guilt on your back . I was outrunning my piano . The owl had been staring , stupefied , at the approaching cars . When it heard my pounding feet , it swiveled its gaze at me . Instant sphere . Great good or ill impending . I heard cars in the opposite lane coming up behind me and realized that if the cars in my lane did see me , they might be frightened into swerving into a head-on crash . I was risking lives besides my own . I had succumbed to a kind of madness . Yet as I sprinted toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceivable , beautiful outcome . The lead car saw me and hit its horn just as I reached the owl . I swung my right foot in the gentlest possible kick , chipping the bird like a soccer ball toward the road 's shoulder . I followed the bird instantly , not quite needing to dive as the lead car shot past , outraged hom blaring . All ten cars shot past . I ignored them , searching the rain gusts and night air . And at the edge of the many headlight beams I suddenly saw my tiny owl in uninjured , earnest flight , circling straight back toward the trafficfilled highway . I do n't know what my body did in that moment , whether my heart stopped or my eyes sent out energy , whether my lips and lungs actually uttered the " Please ! " When your whole being yearns for one simple thing , it may not be necessary to add the words . All I know is that a gust of sideways rain blasted my owl , its wings twisted in response , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed both lanes , left the highway , and vanished , without once looking back , into the forest and the night . The eyes , it has been said , are the " windows of the soul . " Since the soul is not a literal object but a spiritual one , eyes can not be the soul 's literal windows . But they are openings into and out of living human beings . When our eyes are open , they become not one of our many walls but one of our very few doors . The mouth is another such door . Through it we inhale air that is not ownable , air that we share with every being on earth . And out of our mouths we send words-our personal reshaping of that same communal air . Seeing , I have come to feel , is the very same kind of process . Through our eyes we inhale light and images we can not own-light and images shared with every being on earth . And out of our eyes we exhale a light or a darkness that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this personal energizing and aiming of perception , is the eyes ' speech . It is a reshaping of light as surely as words are a reshaping of air . I therefore feel responsible for my vision . My eye-speech changes the world . Seeing is a blood sport . I 'm still in way over my head . I believe that this is my Maker 's intention . I 'm in so far over my head that I believe I 'll need wings to get out . But even over my head I sense that if all souls are one and the eyes are its windows , then those siskin , owl , snipe , and grebe eyes must all , in a realm outside of time , be my very own . So in killing or saving those eyes , in abandoning or loving them , I kill , save , abandon , or love what is outside of time-that is , what is eternal-in myself . This is Buddhist platitude , Christian and Islamic platitude , Native American platitude too , and platitudes do n't make very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And in a world in which one 's living eyes and body must fly into split-second meetings with the eyes and bodies of others on wet night roads , storm-smashed beaches , in treetops or on blind curves , one needs all the aids to memory one can get . The God of the Bible commences creation with an exhalation of light from spirit . Shiva is said to be capable of destroying creation by simply opening an eye . Through a life spent looking , or refusing to look , at an endless stream of other creatures , I 've learned that by merely opening my eyes , 1 , too , take part in the creation and destruction of the world . By abandoning a grebe that entered my sphere of vision , I closed two beautiful molten windows through which I might have gazed upon a real salvation . By kicking a twice-runover owl skyward , I opened two wondrous dark windows upon the same . One of the terrors of being human , and one of the joys , is that for all our limitations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrifies me and the life that I adore are one life .
