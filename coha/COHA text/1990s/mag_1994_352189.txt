Asked if he felt indebted to Russia for helping crush the Hungarian uprising in 1848 , Austria 's Prince Schwarzenberg replied , " Austria will astound the world with the magnitude of her ingratitude . " So will Haiti . <P> The first headlines from Haiti had boisterous , almost frenetic crowds joyfully welcoming American troops . Alas , we were also received with joy in Somalia . Why , even the Israelis were showered with flowers ( by locals glad to be rid of the P.L.O. ) when they invaded Lebanon in 1982 . Three years later , they withdrew under a hail of bullets and bombs . <P> Initial shows of gratitude by the occupied are the norm . After all , they have often been liberated from something worse . And even if not , when men with guns and tanks arrive , it is a good idea to show a friendly face . It does not take long , however , for that face to turn . <P> It took a year for Somalia to turn , and in Somalia , we were there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Haiti , where we have gone to rule . Ruling creates enemies . We are now the colonial power in Haiti , and Haiti will not long take kindly to its assigned role as white man 's burden . <P> Haiti 's President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is already tired of it . He put his irritation with his benefactors on full display even before all U.S. troops had gone ashore . For three full days after the Carter agreement , he uttered not a word of thanks to America for the 20,000 troops on whose backs he will ride to the presidential palace in Port-au-Prince . <P> A thank you was eventually squeezed out of him , but it was not easy . It took importuning from the President of the U.S. , a high-level meeting with nearly every big shot on Clinton 's foreign-policy team , capped by a 21-gun salute on the Pentagon grounds . Thus flattered , His Excellency deigned to say a merci . The Clinton people sighed with relief . <P> The groveling was necessary . Haiti policy was being savaged by a Congress outraged at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craving for gratitude that betrays the emptiness of this adventure . A foreign policy carried out in a country 's own national interest will justify itself . Gratitude is nice  --  we appreciate the appreciation of the Grenadians , Panamanians and Kuwaitis  --  but it is a bonus . For a foreign policy carried out in pursuit of no discernible national interest , however , gratitude is essential . It is , after all , the only reward . <P> America fled Somalia after 18 Army Rangers died because the cost of the operation became apparent . But there was a more visceral reaction propelling our retreat : a sense of betrayal . Here we are doing this for the Somalis , for no benefit to ourselves , and this is how they repay us ! To hell with the ingrates . <P> Ingratitude is fatal to a foreign policy of selflessness . And selfless intervention , unmoored from any conception of national interest , defines Clinton foreign policy . For George Bush , author of our first purely humanitarian intervention , Somalia was an afterthought . For Clinton it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding the starving to nation building , until driven out by public opinion . In Bosnia only last month , a U.N . bureaucrat was able to call in U.S. warplanes to strike at Serbs to avenge French peacekeepers wounded by Serb gunmen bent on fighting Muslims . What this has to do with us Clinton has yet to explain . And now Haiti .
