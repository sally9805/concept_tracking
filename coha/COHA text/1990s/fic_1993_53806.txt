She made some big changes that spring . The first one was moving out of David s house in Beachwood Canyon and into a one-bedroom apartment in Park La Brea . <p> " Old ladies live there " was David 's comment . <p> " I like old ladies , " she said . " Old ladies are quiet and-consider-ate . They do n't have car phones , either . " <p> " I 'm at the set " he said . " I 'll call you later . " <p> She found a new job . For three years , she had coordinated a production office , meeting the demands of actors , drivers , assistant directors , grips . Now she sat alone in a small room on what used to be the Goldwyn lot , reading . <p> " I am a reader , " she reminded herself several times during the first week . " I read for a living . They pay me to read . " She repeated this to Bugs when they met for lunch . <p> " But how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over the top of the menu . She was dressed up , for her , in a wrinkled linen suit and high heels . Interview clothes . <p> " Money is n't the point . " <p> " Then I guess I 'm missing it . " <p> Bugs thought Cecilia had made a mistake , leaving production . They 'd met as office runners on a low-budget horror spoof called Killer Fleas . It was the kind of shoot , rife with tension and disaster , that created good stories and strong friendships , though the film itself went straight to video . As they moved on to other , better jobs , on slightly better movies , Cecilia felt more and more that she was working against her nature . Bugs , on the other hand , came into herself . Production defined her ; she seemed stronger , even taller , these days . <p> " Development is a dead-end field for women  --  ( a ) " Bugs said . " And ( b ) , you 're what , thirty-two ? Too old to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sounds . A reader . The life of the mind . " <p> " Oh , please . " <p> " We talked about Kafka when I interviewed with him . " Cecilia smiled to herself . What they 'd talked about was whether Kafka would have liked Eraserhead . <p> " O.K. , he went to college . But what kind of man is named Bayard Buchanan ? I bet he made it up . " <p> " He was at Apex . Co-produced Dry Ice . " <p> " Hmm . Interesting film . " <p> " He 'll be gone most of the time . I 'll just fax him the coverage " <p> " O.K. , I 'm beginning to see the potential . You 've got your little office , your days practically free . Maybe you can write a script . " <p> " Oh , no . " <p> " Everybody 's writing one . It 's not hard . " <p> " It should be . " <p> " Excuse me for saying this , but now that you 're out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As she spoke , Bugs scraped some scattered bread crumbs into a rectangular shape with her fingernail . " He has n't cornered the market on ideas , now , has he ? " she added . <p> Cecilia had n't seen David in several weeks , though they spoke on the phone almost every day . He was directing his first feature , an ecological thriller , budgeted at $1.8 million . There were some proposed script changes , and he needed her opinion  --  what if Ronck ( the hero ) and Thea ( the biologist ) were ex-lovers , had a past , as it were ? <p> " It 's possible , I guess . " <p> " But is it better ? " <p> " Do n't know , " she said . " Let me think about it . " <p> Cecilia had seen David 's picture in " The Great Life " column in The Hollywood Reporter , and noticed he 'd had his hair buzzed short . They used to laugh at that column  --  one long string of names interspersed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fingernail . David was being invited to a few openings and parties now . He was pictured with Minnie Pontesca , a model and bass player . He 'd cast her in his film . <p> " She 's very insecure , " he told Cecilia . The transmission crackled as he drove through Cahuenga Pass . <p> " You find that attractive , do n't you ? " <p> " Why is everything so personal with you ? I do n't know , I was hoping we could be friends . " <p> " I think you call me out of habit . " <p> " Want me to stop ? " <p> " Yes , I do . " <p> " No , you do n't . " <p> He was right . She did n't want that yet . <p> They came close to meeting in early April , when Bugs held her annual Academy Awards-watching party . Cecilia felt uncomfortable and exposed , moving among the people who had known her up to now as one half ( the less interesting half ? ) of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the women asked . The husbands and boyfriends regarded her with sympathy , gave her one-armed hugs and planted friendly kisses on her cheek . Cecilia slipped out before the best actress was announced ; Bugs called her the next morning to scold her and inform her she 'd won the Oscar pool . David had dropped in late , Bugs said , " with a friend . " <p> " Minnie . " <p> " They came from work . I do n't think it means much . He was sorry he missed you . " <p> " How 'd he look ? " <p> " Exhausted . He pumped me about your doings " <p> " Yeah ? What did you say ? " <p> " I told him you were an emerging woman " <p> " That was nice of you , Bugs . " <p> " You know I do n't say anything unless I firmly believe it . " <p> " O.K. Do n't worry , I 'll emerge " Cecilia said . <p> Her days were quiet . Bayard Buchanan was on location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice when she called the production office to leave a message for him . That 's how I used to sound , she thought . It seemed like a long time ago . <p> Bugs started work on a new movie , about a clinically depressed country singer , and had no more time to socialize . Not that Cecilia needed to socialize . This was enough  --  the new , uncluttered apartment , the comfortable little office , the stack of scripts to be read . A nourishing routine . <p> The first week of May , during one of their cellular chats , Cecilia told David that she 'd seen the latest Wim Wenders film , and they argued about it . He could n't believe that she did n't agree with him that it was bloated , artificial , and sexist in the most insidious way . She told him he should n't use words he did n't understand . The conversation took a bad turn , then was cut off when David hit a patch of interference . Neither one of them attempted to call back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , she thought , So that was it . She had wondered how the end would feel , never imagining anything so vague and unsatisfying . She could make herself miss him when she wanted to , by remembering certain tender moments , like the night they saw Tokyo Story in Boston and cried and hugged each other for a long time on the sidewalk outside the Brattle . She had been sure she loved him that night , and that he had loved her . She wondered now if it had been a trick she played on herself , a mood they 'd picked up from the Ozu film , life imitating art . <p> The work spilled into her evenings . She would start another script while she ate her dinner , and finish it in front of the TV . She heard that David 's movie had finished shooting and was now " in post . " <p> Other than Bugs , Bayard Buchanan , and the kid from the mail-room , the only people Cecilia spoke to on a regular basis were agents phoning in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of euphemisms by the phone , things she could say to appease them  --  phrases like " intriguing setting , " " elements out of balance , " " needs larger context , " " could deepen character of mother/wife/girlfriend . " <p> There was always the chance that some of them would take courage from these phrases and shower her with other , more intriguing scripts with larger contexts and fully developed wives and girlfriends . One such young man , from Rosenthal &; Benioff , called her one morning and insisted on sending , that day , by messenger , a script she would not only recommend , but champion , once she cast her eyes upon it . <p> " What is it called ? " Cecilia asked . <p> " Succubus . It 's a working title . " <p> " I look forward to reading it . " She hung up the phone and sighed . <p> The messenger knocked on the door just before lunch . Cecilia signed for the two-pound bundle of words . <p> " Huh , " he said . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . " <p> " From birth ? " <p> " Soon after . " <p> " Incredible , " he said , setting his motorcycle helmet down on the visitor 's chair . " That 's the name of the girl in my story . " He blushed , handsomely . " I 'm writing a script . " <p> " No kidding , " she said . <p> " This is truly amazing . " <p> " Well , the name 's not that rare . " <p> " No " he said . " It 's no accident . I ca n't explain it now . This is so cool , Cecilia . " <p> He smiled a radiant , young-Gary Cooper smile and handed her a copy of the delivery ticket . She found herself smiling back , enjoying the joke , though she would have been hard-pressed to articulate what that was . <p> " I 'm Sam , " he said , picking up his helmet . He paused in the doorway to don his Ray-Bans . " We 'll meet again . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned up the next day with a lighter bundle  --  the first fifty pages of his own original screenplay . <p> " You 're the one who can help me ; ' he said . " I know it . " <p> Cecilia waved the envelope away . <p> " Look , " she said . " Bayard Buchanan is very strict about unsolicited material . " <p> " I do n't want him to see it . It 's not ready yet . I thought you might skim through it after work , and we could meet for coffee  --  maybe Friday . Or how about this : we meet somewhere and I tell you the story . No reading required " <p> " My time is valuable , Sam . " <p> He sunk into the visitor 's chair , script in hand . " I know . I know it 's valuable . " He exhaled heavily . " I ca n't argue with that . " <p> She weakened . " Oh , all right . Give me a few days . Then we can talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take long , " he said , on his feet again . " Half an hour , tops . You just have to listen ; you do n't even have to think . Then just say whatever pops into your head , or nothing , if that 's what pops in . Do you believe in signs , Cecilia ? " <p> Another one of his grins emerged  --  they were his language , she was beginning to realize , infinitely more persuasive than his actual speech . <p> " No " she said . <p> " That 's good , " he said . " It 's good that you do n't . " <p> They met the following Monday night at Bob 's Big Boy in Toluca Lake , because it was David Lynch 's favorite Bob 's . Sam insisted they both order Super Big Boy Combos , just to get into the spirit of the place . Then he asked her to please call him Andy from now on . <p> " Why ? " <p> " Because it 's sort of my actual name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Excuse me ? " <p> " You know , like Sam Shepard . I decided I wanted to be Sam Shepard . Some people were telling me I looked like him or something , and he 's a writer . Want one ? " <p> When she declined the cigarette , he lit one for himself and exhaled slowly . <p> " My script 's in trouble , " he said . <p> " I guessed that . " <p> " You 're so fucking perceptive , Cecilia . " <p> It was a quest , a spiritual story , he explained . If that did n't put her off . She said she 'd try to listen with an open mind . <p> Picture a pilgrim , he said , an everyman . The Poet , the Madman , the Fool . It took place sometime in the near future , in another America  --  what America will become , in the last days . <p> " Armageddon ? " <p> " I 'm not a born-again , Cecilia . Bear with me . " <p> Our hero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Chicago , searching for a baseball card . <p> " This is n't one of those mystical baseball movies ? " <p> " Not exactly . " <p> Sam/Andy would figure out later which baseball card the hero is seeking . Maybe Gehrig , maybe the Babe . There are very few people left in the small towns ; most have armed themselves and taken to the hills , or , where there are no hills , to the caves . In the cities , the rich are on drugs , held hostage in their condos by roving bands of delinquent children . In Kansas , right smack in the middle of the Heartland , Pilgrim meets Cecilia . She is an American shamanness , a woman warrior . They get together . <p> " They go to bed together ? " <p> " Um , right . So the Pilgrim has broken his vow of celibacy , see , and he loses sight of the quest . " <p> " The quest for Babe Ruth ? " <p> " You think it should be somebody else ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is where we get stuck . Nick , my partner , thinks Cecilia should be a girl along for the ride , you know ? They go to Chicago , find a card , but it 's not the card . They 're almost killed by the child gangsters . One of the smaller kids gets hurt , and they take him along . You know , a Holy Family kind of thing . " <p> Cecilia stared at the remains of her Super Big Boy Combo . <p> " It sucks , does n't it ? " He slapped the edge of the table with the hand that was n't holding the cigarette . <p> " I did n't say that . " <p> " Is everything all right with you folks ? " the waitress asked as she approached their booth with the coffee pot . <p> " Yeah , hi . Hi , Pat . Tell me , when David Lynch , when Mr. Lynch comes in here , how many napkins does he fill up with ideas ? That 's how he does it , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stares into space , mostly , " she said . <p> They met a few more times , after she 'd read his fifty pages . Andy picked the place  --  always a coffee shop  --  and they talked , or he talked , later and later into the night . Cecilia , when pressed about the script , emphasized its unique , surreal qualities . She was never required to say very much . <p> Listening to Andy left Cecilia no room for her own thoughts . He reminded her of the young Richard Basehart in her favorite film , La Strada  --  a beautiful clown . The waitress at Ships said , " Have n't I seen you on TV ? " and Andy brushed it off . " This town , " he grumbled , but leaning back in his leather jacket , smoke circling his head , he looked like a photograph waiting to be snapped . <p> After they 'd addressed the script from every possible angle , there was his life story , entertaining in its own right . A privileged upbringing in San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the desert . A weekend in a Mexican prison , reading On the Road . He alluded , in passing , to many romances , as if Cecilia would pick up the references , as if she had been there . <p> " Who 's Tracy ? " she 'd have to ask . " Who 's Carlisle ? " He 'd shake his head sadly . " She was a nice girl . " <p> " Did you love her ? " <p> " Love is just a thought , Cecilia . " <p> " Then what 's the point of it ? " she snapped . <p> " Whoa . Woman warrior . Are we strung out on some guy ? " <p> She shrugged . <p> He reached over and rested his hand on her shoulder . " Remember this : it 's not about the guy , Cecilia . It 's not about happy ever after . There 's the good dream and there 's the bad dream and then there 's no dream . Know what I mean ? " <p> She smiled and shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the script . The last shot : Pilgrim and Cecilia and the kid head out from the city . It 's in ashes . They have nothing left . Zip . No dream . But they keep moving , see ? They 're alive to tell the tale " <p> Cecilia got home from these outings at two in the morning and fell into bed , exhausted and relieved . She liked the smell of smoke in her hair the next day , and the way the fatigue distorted her perceptions . " Night , babe ! " Andy had called to her in the parking lot at Ships , just before he kick-started his motorcycle . No one had ever called her that before . <p> It was June . The apartment would be hot and still when she got home , but it did n't seem worth it , turning on the air conditioner for just one person . She found herself craving the presence of a huge , fluffy cat . A few tenants  --  old ladies , no doubt  --  were keeping them , secretly , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mornings and seen a graceful dark shape brush past the curtains of the window across the courtyard . <p> " You 're just depressed , " Bugs said on the phone . Did Cecilia know that depression was anger turned inward ? Cecilia said she did . Bugs recommended a self-help book that everybody on the crew was reading : Depression , The Inner Journey . Even though she had no intention of reading it , Cecilia felt vaguely uplifted by the title . If she had to endure the diagnosis , it was encouraging to think of it as a form of travel . <p> It had become her habit to postpone the trip home by bringing some work to a suitable , air-conditioned restaurant and eating dinner there . Bayard Buchanan would be back from location soon , and a flurry of spec scripts had flown in from all over town . She decided to have them read and covered by the time he arrived  --  not that he 'd expect it , but simply to keep herself motivated . She pictured a story meeting , with her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team of writers on the other . " I think Cecilia 's point is well taken " B.B. was saying . <p> One night at the Supplantation , she looked up from her script  --  it was the second one to come in that month about a violent love triangle among real estate agents . She watched the ordinary , low-concept customers , struck for a moment by the gap between life as she was experiencing it and the life contained between the cardboard covers . <p> A man she 'd been watching  --  tired , fiftyish , raised his head from his plate and met her eyes for a second before they both looked down . In a script , characters often " lost their heads . " People locked eyes and passion ignited ; they moved towards each other like forces of nature  --  always that pulling together , hardly ever the slow unraveling that happens down the line . Was that what prevented her from coming up with a script of her own  --  an inability to lie in this most basic way ? Maybe it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose life was symbol-packed and full of crises , and wondered how such a life would feel from the inside  --  more immediate , more real ? <p> After dinner , she walked up La Cienega towards the Rexall . A skateboarder with long blond dreadlocks almost ran her down in front of Johnny Rocket 's . I 'm invisible , she thought . There was a pay phone across the street . She found Andy listed on Poinsettia Place . He picked up before she heard a ring . <p> " Talk to me , " he said . <p> " Hi , Andy ? It 's Cecilia . " <p> " Cecilia , what are you doing ? " <p> " Um , I was thinking about your script tonight , and  --  " <p> " Where are you right now ? " <p> " I 'm at a pay phone , on Beverly and La Cienega . " <p> " Do n't move . " He hung up . <p> She waited five minutes , standing by the phone , until she heard the grumbling downshift of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beverly . He swung the bike to a stop in front of the phone booth , with the engine running . <p> " Hop on " he yelled . <p> Andy lived in a ramshackle eight-unit building , overgrown with jungly shrubs and painted the color of blood oranges . They stepped over a sprawling , three-toned cat and up a flight of stairs  --  somebody was playing the Beatles ' " Number 9 "  --  to Andy 's paper-strewn single apartment . It smelled of cigarette smoke and incense . He cleared a place for her on the futon couch . <p> " I 'll make you some hot chocolate , " he said . <p> " Actually , ice water would be good , " she answered , sitting on the edge of the couch . " Is the cat yours ? " <p> " The cat ? " She heard pans rattling from the kitchen , then the tick-tick-tick of the gas burner . " That cat thinks he knows everything . But you know what ? He 's wrong . Dead wrong . " <p> " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . She studied the room as if it were a set : an arrangement of crystals twinkled from the top of the television ; layers of curling Post-its  --  sun-dried ideas  --  covered the entire surface of the ten-inch screen . On the floor near her feet were Egri 's The Art of Dramatic Writing and the I Ching . On the windowsill behind her , an ashtray , a boom box , and a baby cactus in a two-inch pot . <p> He walked slowly back into the room , carrying two mugs of cocoa . <p> " What time is it ? " He handed her a cup . <p> " Nine-thirty , maybe ten . I lost my watch this weekend . " <p> " No shit . Cecilia , guess what ? I lost my watch . This very afternoon . " He sat cross-legged on the couch . " I was in the hell realm when you called . Here  --  " <p> Andy touched his mug to hers in a toast . <p> " We 're out of time now , babe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sipped his cocoa . <p> " What 's happened ? " she asked . <p> " I ca n't go into it . " <p> Without too much coaxing on her part , however , the story emerged : he had met with Nick late in the afternoon , to discuss the first draft of The Pilgrim . They 'd argued about the role of the baseball card , which Andy now felt was the key element , the Grail itself . Nick had questioned Andy 's sanity , and they came to blows . <p> " He hit you ? " <p> " Well , not exactly . There was some shoving . He took the draft and told me I was out of it now . He 's finishing it himself . Cecilia , a year of my life , maybe my whole life , went into that script . " <p> " I 'm sure he 'll reconsider , when he calms down a bit . " <p> " You know how the baseball card carne to me ? In a dream . It was the same dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me in that dream . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Your name . Cecilia . " <p> " Oh " <p> " I 'm glad you 're here tonight . It 's the only good thing that 's happened to me today . So what was it you wanted to tell me ? When you called , you said you had notes about the script . " <p> " Actually , " she said , " I do n't have anything to say about your script . I was walking down the street tonight , and all of a sudden I felt totally transparent . Not there . Then I wanted to talk to you . Have you ever felt like that ? " <p> " I like you in glasses . Why have n't you worn them before ? " <p> " I have contacts . They were bothering me . " <p> " You look like Dorothy Parker 's little sister , or something . " <p> " Have you ever seen a picture of Dorothy Parker ? " <p> " I think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her glasses and set them on the windowsill . The background blurred . She thought what a relief it was to be in the company of a man with whom there could be no pretense of mutual understanding . Whatever she did could n't possibly count . She started to laugh , and Andy joined her , for his own reasons , but it felt for a moment as if they were sharing something . <p> There was another moment , a half-hour or maybe an hour later  --  without a watch , who could say ?  --  when they 'd kissed for a while and his mouth was soft like a baby 's and the stubble on his chin scratched her face . He liked to kiss . His hand moved up under her T-shirt and over her back like the answer to a question , and the answer was warmth and pressure , flesh  --  all things material . <p> " Look what we 're doing " he said . <p> Even as their bodies came together , urgently , without any more words , she was conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumping down the stairs , and of a breeze that drifted in through the open windows . She attached no meaning to these sensations . And before Andy untangled his limbs from hers and sat up , reaching for his cigarettes , Cecilia read his second thoughts . She could have gone on for a long while , breathing in salty skin , bearing the weight of another body . She stroked his thigh . <p> " You 're not in love with me , are you , Cecilia ? " he said . <p> She smiled at his fretful expression . " I do n't think so " she said . <p> " That 's good . " He blew smoke into a long column above his head . " But why are n't you ? " <p> They both laughed at Andy 's joke . <p> " No hard feelings , though ? " <p> She shook her head . <p> " Cecilia , you 're so Zen , " he said . <p> After they had unfolded the futon and turned out the light , Andy said good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Cecilia . She tucked her arms behind her head and watched the car headlights stretch themselves one by one across the ceiling as the traffic moved past outside . Her body was wide awake , conscious of its extremities : toes and fingers , elbows , scalp . <p> Her thoughts rolled by , another kind of traffic . Bits of conversations , Andy 's voice , David 's voice , lines from the script she 'd been reading in the restaurant . She watched the thoughts pass , contentedly , as if she were the surface on which they traveled , vast and self-contained . <p> In the morning , she would step over the cat who knew everything , ride back to her car on the back of his motorcycle , go to work in the same clothes , though there would be no one there who would remember what she 'd worn the day before . She 'd call Bugs , who would pump her for the details of the previous evening and reassemble them in her own emphatic way , as a kind of breakthrough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She did n't keep in touch with Andy until , six months later , he sent her a draft of The Pilgrim with a note , explaining that he and Nick had patched things up and wondering if she had the time to look at the script again . She had a new title by then  --  Senior Development Executive  --  and a new office at Apex , where Bayard Buchanan was now head of production . Andy was very impressed at the news of her promotion , and lifted his coffee mug in toast after toast when they met at Hugo 's for breakfast on a drizzly morning in January . They drank to her future , to her mind , to their everlasting friendship . She looked beautiful , he told her , with a smile that spoke of intimacy and regret . She felt herself returning the smile , playing along , though she found the memory of their one night together rather elusive , in fact almost impossible to believe . <p> " Cecilia , you 're so fucking inspiring . You 're , like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him a few kind notes on the latest draft . He reached across the table and pressed her hand . " What happened with us ? " <p> " I 've often wondered , " Cecilia said , untruthfully . <p> " Me , too , " he said , giving her fingers another squeeze before they both dug into their omelettes . <p> How mutable , how pleasant it was , Cecilia thought ; this imaginary past of theirs , the what-might-have-happened . Never having begun , it required no development , no second act , no reversal , no catharsis , and no resolution at the end . <p> <p> By EILEEN McGUIRE <p> EILEEN McGUIRE 's stories have appeared in the anthology Delphinium Blossoms ( Delphinium Books , 1990 ) , The American Literary Review , and Glimmer Train .
