CHESS MATES The International Chess Federation 's world championships started last week , and even though they 're in Las Vegas , still nobody cares . We asked some of the biggest names in sports what they would do to spice up chess 's image . Hey , if it worked for soccer ... <P> Bob Ley , ESPN SportsCenter anchor : Chess has a rich history of personal rivalry and quirky characters , and they need to publicize that aspect . Obviously , contestants should also wear those Lycra body suits , and I think the replay rule should be seriously considered . Frankly , I 'm shocked it 's not on pay-per-view . <P> George Steinbrenner , owner of the New York Yankees : I love the game the way it is , but the average fan is action oriented and is n't patient enough by nature to understand the true beauty of the game . I do n't think it 's possible to make chess more action oriented without hurting the very foundation of the game . <P> Vince McMahon , chairman of the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display , add some voluptuous women to wipe the contestants ' brows . I guess I would also add hard rock music in there somewhere and some physicality . Whoever loses would be hit with a folding metal chair .
