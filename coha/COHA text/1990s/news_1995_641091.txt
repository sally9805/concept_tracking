<p> Campbell 's switch brings advice : resign , give rebates <p> I 'm sure that the Republican Party is rejoicing in the desertion of Sen. Ben Campbell to their ranks , but the people of Colorado , Republican and Democrat alike , should be concerned about this kind of action . The point is that this is not an act that involves courage or conviction . It is an act of fraud and cowardice , with the victims being the majority of the voting public that selected this person and this party to represent them in Congress . <p> The fact that this candidate did not disclose his concerns about his own party in the last election and in his own words " has been struggling with the decision for some time , " leads to the conclusion that he did what he could to get elected , and now , with current changes , feels that his best chance to keep his position is to switch parties . <p> PATRICK HORTON <p> Denver <p> The Democratic Party was certainly in need of some good news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Turncoat Campbell " to switch political parties should be both welcome and invigorating news to all Democrats . <p> FRANCIS SALAZAR <p> Englewood <p> Regarding Sen. Ben Campbell 's switch to the Republican Party , there is the question of whom he represents . It appears , at least , that he no longer represents the majority of the people who voted for him , if he ever did . Chuck Green mentioned in his article that Campbell " is prepared to return any political contribution from donors who might think they have been misled . " <p> My contribution was my vote , and I say that he misled me . I want my vote returned . Unfortunately , there is no means whereby a recall election could be held for someone elected to a federal office . Perhaps that should be changed . <p> SEYMOUR GELLER <p> Boulder <p> First and foremost , I am a Democrat - and proud of it . With the vote that I cast in November 1992 , I felt that I had made a difference . But when Senator Campbell switched sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I voted for the Democratic ideas that represented the way I felt . The Republican party says they welcome Senator Campbell into their fold , and that he switched parties because of his convictions and the difference between him and the Democrats . Would the Republicans feel this way if a fellow Republican decided to switch ? <p> The only thing that matters to Campbell is his opinion and selfishness , and that the main argument is : once in office , I can do what I want . <p> MELISSA RUZICKA <p> Littleton <p> Now that Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell has announced his intention to change political parties , the next step is clear . He should return every dime , every dollar given by Colorado Democrats in 1992 which helped him gain election to his seat . If he is an honorable man , he will do this . If he is not , he probably wo n't . It 's that simple . <p> JIM FERERRO <p> Arvada <p> In the 1992 election I voted for a Democrat , Ben Campbell , to represent me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I no longer am represented in the Senate . <p> If Campbell has any integrity and honor left , he should resign and allow Governor Romer to name another Democrat in his place . Campbell then can stand for re-election in 1996 as a Republican . Even the thuggish Phil Gramm did that when he changed parties . Surely Campbell can measure up to Gramm 's low standards . <p> JAMES WHITESIDE <p> Denver <p> I am irate that Ben " Turnhorse " Campbell has turned his back on every Democrat who voted for him . I do n't understand a system that allows this betrayal of the voters . <p> Senator Campbell was voted in by Democrats to represent Democrats . It was Democratic contributions that elected him . If he is now dissatisfied with the Democratic Congress , he could have announced a planned change at the end of his term or even resigned . <p> JACKIE MARQUIS <p> Colorado Springs <p> Turncoat Ben Campbell seems to have forgotten it was the Democrats who dug deep into their pockets to help him financially when he needed the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell has rubbed shoulders with the " rich and the famous " and has become " rich and famous " himself . When he was poor he was a Democrat , but when he became rich he too changed into a Republican . <p> Republicans had better watch their backs Ben Campbell will stick it to them , too . I believe that most Democrats will say " good riddance " of a turncoat . <p> ROBERT WATSON <p> Cedaredge <p> If the citizens of Colorado had wanted two Republican senators in Washington , they would never have voted for Ben Campbell . <p> GENE ANDERSON <p> Denver <p> As A Colorado Republican who is pro-choice and pro-family , I heartily welcome Sen. Ben Campbell and his pro-choice stance to our party . <p> Senator Campbell will be pleasantly surprised , I think , by how many Colorado Republicans will embrace him on this issue alone . Stand firm , Ben . You speak for me and I fervently hope your voice will be heard on this issue within the state and national Republican hierarchy . <p> RITA HOOD <p> Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch to the Republican Party has n't noticed the long line of political opportunists and fringe interest groups who have clung to the skirts of the Democratic Party for decades . <p> Although the basic notions of individual rights and equal protection under the law are strong draws for lifelong donkeys like me , for someone like Senator Campbell , who seems to be mostly interested in being invited to parties and treated well , the Republican get-togethers may offer much more in the way of interesting hors d'oeuvres . <p> All in all , it 's a grand day for the GOP . They 've added another feather to their cap without having worked for it . So enjoy your newest best friend , Senator Dole , but be careful - when Ben comes to your house , you 'd better make sure he gets first whack at the pate . <p> JIM KELLY <p> Parker <p> Bias in cultural facilities is disputed <p> On behalf of The Children 's Museum of Denver Inc. , we wish to respond to the Feb. 19 op-ed article , " City 's cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article questioned the make-up and diversity of people on the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District organizations ' board of directors and staffs , and people the organizations serve . <p> Here is our rebuttal to the article : <p> The Children 's Museum of Denver participation includes people who are diverse ethnically , racially , economically and in gender . Diversity is represented in the board of directors , staff and people served by the exhibits , programs , special events and community outreach . African-Americans , Asian-Americans , Caucasians and Hispanics are board members , as are members of the Christian and Jewish faiths . The nine women and 14 men on the board comprise single parents , grandparents , educators , and corporate and community leaders who represent the public , private and nonprofit sectors . <p> The 27 full-time and 13 part-time staffers are as ethnically and culturally diverse as the board of directors . People with handicaps , grandparents , single parents and students round out a cohesive , committed staff . <p> The people served by the museum are diverse economically , physically , culturally and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minorities , have come through collaborative efforts with the Denver Housing Authority in providing free memberships to low-income families . The Regional Transportation District has added the museum to its bus route . <p> During the school year , most visitors participate in school programs offered by our education department . Other users are pre-schoolers accompanied by parents or day- care providers . <p> We are proud to serve the youth and community of Denver and are grateful to the citizens of the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District for their generous support . <p> JAMES V. LEE <p> President , Board of Directors <p> PHYLLIS CHRISMAN <p> Director , Resource Development <p> LAURA CAMPBELL <p> Director , Education <p> The Children 's Museum of Denver Inc . <p> Marilyn Robinson wins <p> praise from police <p> I wanted to pass along a sentiment about Marilyn Robinson . Recently she reported on a police shooting in the City of Westminster . Marilyn reported in an up-front and fair manner . She did not sensationalize either perspective , and in the process further bridged a professional working relationship . <p> In our experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1995 , people are suspicious of everything . Marilyn shatters the image that we build about " media " folks . She is very straightforward and has built a respected working relationship with our public information officers . She makes you all look good ! <p> R.
