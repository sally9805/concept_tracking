Section : BUSINESS &; PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES Bypassing the traditional gallery system , four artists created their own ways to show and sell their work . <p> Art galleries and dealers are the gatekeepers to the art world , leading to exposure , sales , a place at the table . But , for some artists , that gate is a barrier , lessening their chances to show and sell their work and keeping away would-be buyers who are not part of the art market because they are interested in work that is decorative or sentimental  --  terms that are not art criteria . From time to time , artists look to show and sell their artwork outside " the system , " perhaps putting their work in malls , Oh sidewalks , or Oh the Internet . <p> After beating their heads against the wall trying to get into the traditional art market , husband and wife Robert and Michele Kennedy of Key West , Florida , decided to open their own galleries : Kennedy Galleries for paintings and Kennedy Studios for prints and photographic reproductions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Key West , we do $2 million a year , " Mr. Kennedy notes ) that beginning in the 1980s the two started to franchise their name . Now , there are 42 Kennedy Studios and five Kennedy Galleries around the United States ; all display the two artists ' work . <p> " I did n't want to tiptoe around dealers , " says Mrs. Kennedy , " or convince a gallery owner that my painting works . " She also did n't want to wait for her work to be displayed and wait even longer for sales . " Galleries tend to pigeonhole artists , " she continues . " When something works , they 're afraid of anything different . Some artists find their bliss and keep repeating it , but I do n't want to rely on a style . " Her work covers a wide territory in terms of subject matter and style , from academic realist still lifes to abstract landscapes and satiric German Expressionist images . For marketing reasons dealers generally want the artists they represent to have a defined look , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If I work in one style one day and another the next , it never seems to bother the people who buy my work , " she says . <p> Because of their popularity with buyers , gallery owners have proved willing to pay between $25,000 and $100,000 to franchise the name . Most of the gallery owners exhibit the work of other artists as well and are not required to purchase either of the Kennedys ' work , although they all do , paying 35 percent of the suggested retail price . The galleries must also pay the Kennedys an annual royalty fee of 3 percent of gross sales . <p> Monterey , California , sculptor Richard MacDonald believed the dealers were content to consign rather than buy outright the artworks they represented , limiting both the gallery 's risk and their incentive to make sales . " What kind of business relationship is this , " be questions , " where the artist puts out all the effort and money , and the gallery does nothing ? A car dealer buys a certain number of cars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . That drives the market . Why should n't art dealers meet the same performance requirements ? " <p> Unlike the Kennedys , MacDonald did not start his own gallery but began with an association with over 70 galleries that represented his work , a relationship that encompasses a large part of the operations of these " subscribing galleries . " The galleries sign on to purchase  --  rather than take on consignment  --  a minimum of 10 sculptures . " I need to show enough of my work to have free expression , " MacDonald explains . " If there are only three of my works on the floor , I am not being represented . " <p> When a gallery expresses interest in representing MacDonald 's work , " a representative from our staff visits the gallery to make sure it is compatible with the work , " says Richard Mac Donald , Jr. , the artist 's son and business manager . " Is the gallery large enough for sculpture ? Will the work be given its own space ? " Both MacDonalds look to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the principal sculptor in the gallery and that his work be shown in-depth without the distraction of other artists turns the traditional artist-dealer relationship on its head , but his subscribing galleries play ball . " When you 're doing $1.2 million in sales , which is what my galleries average for my work annually , you can get what you want , " the older MacDonald says . " Success leads to different assumptions . " <p> Marvin Carson , the director of Gallery Revel in New York City , which represents MacDonald , notes , " Every dealer asks himself two questions about the art in his gallery : Does it have integrity and can you make money from it ? And , certainly , MacDonald 's work has the quality , and it sells . There are so few saleable sculptures , and his work captures people 's hearts . " <p> Contracts between MacDonald and the subscribing galleries not only include provisions to purchase 10 pieces outright , but also that they sell a certain number annually and reorder whenever a sale is made . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacDonald says . The subscribing galleries must also regularly place local advertisements , but MacDonald provides the image and approves the text . <p> For his part of the deal , MacDonald not only supplies the artwork but runs national ads in magazines . According to the younger MacDonald , the annual advertising budget is in the six-figure range and includes marketing brochures for all galleries handling the artist 's work , photographs of each piece , cards with a history Oh the back for each piece , letter for galleries to send out to prospective buyers ( the artist employs an in-house writer ) , and videos on the artist and his manner of working to show to collectors . <p> After a gallery agrees to sell MacDonald 's work , gallery staff attend a sales training seminar with a mock sales presentation and discussions of how to present and light the work , how orders should be filled , and what should be said about each piece . The artist runs a medium-sized corporation , with 45 employees , including a sales force of 28 , six account representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat larger operation is run by Monterey painter Thomas Kinkade , whose company , Media Arts Group , is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and has approximately 400 employees . Accounting , customer service legal affairs , marketing , sales , and warehousing departments attend to all those involved in the organization : investors in Media Arts Group ; members of the Thomas Kinkade Collectors Society , which costs $50 per year and allows members to purchase print editions only available to the society ; those seeking $75 tickets to the artist 's appearances at the galleries showing his work ; licensees who create coffee mugs , greeting cards , jigsaw puzzles , mantel clocks , nightlights , plates , stationery , and other products based on Kinkade 's imagery ; and galleries that represent the artist 's work inventory , marketing , and what to say about the art , and though Kinkade occasionally makes visits to signature galleries for an event , such as the release of a new print edition or a signing , the galleries must pay him a stipend for his time and effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consign work to galleries but sells it outright . A gallery 's initial purchase must be at least $40,000 wholesale ( with 60 days to pay ) and include a performance agreement to buy between $50,000 and $100,000 annually . Media Arts stipulates that galleries must mark up their prints 100 percent for retail sales . " You can not discount . If you do that , they 'll cut you right off , " says Stan Brown , owner of three East Coast Thomas Kinkade signature galleries . <p> With so many galleries relying specifically on them , the Kennedys , MacDonald , and Kinkade need to be highly productive . In the mid-1990s , there were approximately 3,000 of Kinkade 's limited-edition prints . More recently , as the number of signature galleries has expanded , the number has topped 10,000 , divided up between canvas and paper prints , and classified as artist 's proofs , gallery proofs , publisher 's proofs , or signed and numbered . Cheryl Cohen , owner of the Leonard Gallery in Springfield , Massachusetts , which features but does n't exclusively represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular , and we sell a lot of his work , but my personal opinion is that he 's coming out with too much product . I 'd worry more about that if I only showed Kinkade . " <p> While large editions mean more people are able to purchase an artist 's work , there is a downside in terms of the artist 's lowered reputation in the mainstream art world . " Serious collectors are serious snobs , " Carson says . " They want to buy works where the edition is eight or fewer . " <p> The need to produce can be quite wearing on an artist . According to Mr. Kennedy , who tends to the business aspects of the franchises , Mrs. Kennedy produces " around 100 paintings a year , maybe two or three a week , " the majority of which become limited-edition prints ( 980 photographic reproductions and 200 giclees ) . " Sometimes , it 's a curse to keep the studios well stocked , but it 's also very motivating , " Mrs. Kennedy says . " I produce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only lament : " I 've never been able to build a body of work . As soon as I 've finished something , it 's out of here . " <p> Approximately 200 of these galleries are referred to as " signature galleries , " a generic term for spaces that exclusively represent one artist , and they only handle prints  --  photographic reproductions of Kinkade 's paintings on paper or canvas . ( The original paintings are rarely sold and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars when they are . ) Many of these galleries , however , also carry the licensed merchandise . <p> Those looking to sell Kinkade 's work undergo a weeklong training program in Monterey ( known as Thomas Kinkade University ) run by the Retail Development Team of Media Arts , with sessions on inventory control , marketing , and sales . A gallery 's layout , lighting ( dimmer switches mandatory ) , walt paint ( teal ) , and carpet color are also decided by Media Arts , and the physical space must be approved by a district sales manager before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company representative of Media Arts ' Share the Light department , which is involved with the signature gallery program , notes that Kinkade " is a regular guy , very unassuming , very easy to talk to , " but most of the gallery owners have little or no relationship with him .
