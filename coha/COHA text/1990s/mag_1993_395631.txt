A READER 'S GUIDE TO PRODUCT LABELS Watch out for misleading health claims and inconsistent serving sizes on product labels . For instance , cholesterol , which is a byproduct of animal protein , would not normally be associated with peanut butter or potato chips . This makes a label that says " no cholesterol " misleading . When a product makes a health claim , a nutritional breakdown must also appear on the product label . Soon new food-label regulations will make it easier to find clear nutritional facts on each product . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Food and Drug Administration 's Consumer Affairs Department in Maryland at ( 301 ) 443-3170 . Compare prices on family- and economy-size products to regular sizes to find the best deal . DOWN THE AISLES CANS AND JARS Here 's a great place to find bargains , but do n't buy a bulging or dented can . Its contents may be contaminated . Check glass jars for bulging tops  --  a sign that the vacuum seal has been broken . Compare prices of store brands with similar brandname items . Many processed foods are now being packed with little or no salt . Read labels and look for a toll-free number or address for questions , recipes or more information . CEREALS/GRAINS Look for cereals with little or no added sugar and fat . Beware , some granolas are high in fat . The Center for Science in the Public Interest recommends no more than two grams of fat , five grams of sugar and 250 milligrams of sodium for one ounce of cereal . At the top of the ingredients list for breads , look for whole grains , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now comes in a quick-cooking version . DAIRY All of us can reap the benefits of eating low-fat dairy products . Here 's what to look for : skim , 1/2- or 1-percent low-fat milk  --  2-percent milk is n't low in fat . A variety of low-fat and nonfat cheeses are now available in many stores . They work best in uncooked dishes and sandwiches . Low-fat and nonfat yogurts make excellent sauces and dips . Use them instead of mayonnaise and sour cream . POULTRY/MEATS Whole chicken and ground beef are frequently good buys in this department . Another is family-size packages of meat ; freeze the uncooked portions until you need them . Boneless cuts , stir-fry strips , kabob chunks , seasoned , stuffed and marinated meats mean less KP duty .

FREEZER Because many are flash-frozen , vegetables in the freezer case may be superior to those found in the produce aisle . Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . Avoid wet or limp packages , which may be defrosting . Vegetables and other foods in plastic bags should be free-flowing . For a fat-free treat , try one of the delicious nonfat frozen yogurts that taste as rich as ice cream . <p>
