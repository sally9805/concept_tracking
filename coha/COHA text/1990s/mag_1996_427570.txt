Section : The Arts <p> The RMS Titaic sank 84 years ago , but there 's a new wave of interest in the great ship . See the mini-series , hum the musical , buy the cookbook ! <p> WHEN EDITH BROWN HAISMAN last saw her daddy nearly 85 years ago , he was standing on deck , smoking a cigar and smiling at his wife and daughter . I 'll see you in New York , ' he said confidently , as his family was bundled into Lifeboat No. 14 . There had been no sense of urgency when the Titanic first struck an iceberg out there in the North Atlantic at 20 minutes before midnight . Everyone kept saying , She 's unsinkable ' , ' recalls Haisman , now 100 and living in Southampton , England . She wondered why they were abandoning the most magnificent movable thing ever built , on its maiden voyage . Not until she was lowered into the 28-degree ocean did she see just how much of the 882-foot liner was underwater . Huddled together against the cold , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band played a hymn , the lights flickered out and , in a thunderous roar , everything on the supership seemed to break loose . Grand pianos , brass beds , English china and the 29 immense boilers that fueled it lurched toward the submerged bow . The black hull tilted perpendicularly ; its three great propellers reared against the heavens . And then it was gone , along with Mr. Brown and 1,522 other souls . <p> Walter Lord called it A Night to Remember ' in his classic 1955 best seller ( now in its 65th printing ) . For Haisman and the rest of the 704 survivors , it was , as she still shudders , a night to forget . ' But the world has never let the night of April 14 , 1912 , pass into oblivion . Seventeen movies , 18 documentaries , at least 130 books and the rivet counters '  --  hard-core fans so obsessed with every detail they can account for all 3 million screws  --  have proliferated from the moment the New York Evening Sun declared , ALL SAVED FROM TITANIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible story  --  a colossal confluence of bad luck , bad timing and bad navigation . The three most written-about subjects of all-time , ' speculates historian Steven Biel in a new cultural history of the disaster , Down With the Old Canoe , may be Jesus , the Civil War , and the Titanic . ' Christ and Gettysburg changed the world  --  but a boat and a berg ? <p> Now comes the latest outbreak of Titanic fever . Sure , the sinking was a calamity , but some of the commemorations have all the solemnity of a carnival . This week , Titanic , a four-hour mini-series , is airing on CBS ; it stars George C. Scott as the ill-fated Capt . Edward J. Smith , who looks like he 's been steering from the dessert table but otherwise does a fine glub ... glub ... glub . ' In April , Titanic , the $10 million musical  --  yes , the musical  --  opens on Broadway , in time for the anniversary of the sinking ( giving your play this title takes guts , sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The biggest , most expensive show arrives this summer : Titanic , the $120 million movie , promises to be terrifying  --  think Jaws ' on ice  --  as well as tragic . The director is James Cameron ( box ) , the fellow who gave us the terrifying Terminator . ' Cameron 's titanic Titanic ' stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet . <p> And that 's only , well , the tip of the iceberg . The story inspired English novelist Beryl Bainbridge in her latest book , Every Man for Himself , short-listed for the prestigious Booker Prize . Then there are two museum exhibitions of artifacts recovered from the deep by George Tulloch . He 's the treasure-hunter who founded the publicly traded RMS Titanic , Inc. , which owns exclusive salvage rights to the wreck . One exhibit opens Nov. 27 at the Nauticus National Maritime Center in Norfolk , Va. , the other in April in Memphis , Tenn . ( A similar show last year in Greenwich , England , brought in 700,000 visitors , including Tom Cruise , who rented out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will love two new interactive CD-ROMs , a Web site where for $25 you can purchase your very own chunk of Titanic coal and  --  this just in  --  the revolutionary Sonicare-toothbrushing system . If sonic technology can find the Titanic two miles below the ocean , ' asks a back-page ad in a recent issue of The New Yorker , why not use it to reach plaque bacteria just below the gumline ? ' Why indeed ? Also in the works : a glossy children 's book next June called Inside the Titanic , with cutaway illustrations and stories of real kids on the cruise , and the posthumous memoirs of Violet Jessop , the star-crossed stewardess of the White Star Line who , unbelievably , was on board both the Titanic and its sister ship , the Britannic , when it also sank ( as well as the third sister , the Olympic , when it collided with another vessel ) . Most riveting of all may be Last Dinner on the Titanic , a cookbook due in April . On the fateful day , quail eggs with caviar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in steerage . Everybody got chilled water . Hyperion plans to launch the cookbook at the Titanic Historical Society 's annual convention on the Queen Mary . Bring life jackets , just in case . <p> Through such commercialism , the allure of the Titanic endures . We know the ending for sure , but we 're transfixed nonetheless . It 's an irresistible tale  --  of tragedy and irony , mystery and money . Prince Philip 's a buff . So are William F. Buckley and moonwalker Buzz Aldrin . It 's a moment in time that encapsulates what life is about , ' says Tulloch , of RMS Titanic , Inc . The Titanic was n't annihilated in an instant like the Challenger or TWA Flight 800 . It took two hours and 40 minutes to sink , during which people  --  rich and poor , young and old  --  had to make choices , whether to save themselves or go down with the ship . Can anyone listen to the story and not ask , What would I have done ? ' It 's a script no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tulloch , a drama that would do Shakespeare proud . ' <p> Each generation ascribes its own meanings to the sinking of the Titanic  --  the hubris of technology , the evils of wealth ( farewell , John Jacob Astor IV and his airedale Kitty , too ) , the dawn of modernity , the end of chivalry and the good old days ( Benjamin Guggenheim , traveling with his mistress , changed into fine evening clothes before going down ) . There 's the legend of Molly Brown , the rags-to-riches millionaire who took over Lifeboat No. 6 and became a national heroine . And the wrenching obituary of Ida and Isidor Straus , the owners of Macy 's , who could 've saved themselves  --  he was old and she was a she . But he refused to get off and she would not go without her husband . The folks at Harvard wo n't forget the Titanic because if streetcar magnate Harry Widener had not been among the victims , Mrs. Widener never would 've dedicated the big library on campus to her son 's memory . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myth that its former swimming requirement had something to do with the Titanic . Even the insurance claims are poignant : one family in steerage put in for a $50 sewing machine they said was their livelihood . The musicians were n't so lucky . The heirs of one were not only denied money for his violin , but bill collectors demanded 15 shillings for the dead man 's uniform . <p> It 's a morality play about conspicuous consumption , a biblical warning to those who would dare to challenge the Almighty , a nice addition to the lexicon ( rearranging deck chairs ... ' ' ) . Early commentary said the doomed liner was a testament to the superiority of men , all the proof necessary why women should n't get suffrage . By contrast , in this week 's TV movie , the Unsinkable Molly Brown ( Marilu Henner ) proclaims herself an emancipated woman . ' Kathy Bates should have a field day playing Molly in Cameron 's big-screen version . <p> By next summer , Tulloch hopes to raise enough money for a second attempt at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 380 miles off the coast of Newfoundland . The previous try , last August , made quite a splash ; Tulloch booked two cruise ships of gawkers ( at up to $6,000 a berth ) , but the salvage was also called grave-robbing . The debate over recovering artifacts is noble , ' says Robert Ballard , the oceanographer who finally located the Titanic in 1985 , but I do n't want to carry it on with someone who went out with Love Boats . ' Maybe Ballard 's sore that the on-board gift shops did n't carry his book , The Discovery of the Titanic , ' which has sold 1.3 million copies . <p> Edith Brown Haisman thinks well of Tulloch . In 94 dives so far , he 's brought up 4,000 items , from a silver soup tureen to a $5 bill . None , though , was more precious than the engraved pocket watch of Haisman 's father that Tulloch presented to her . I should like to be left alone with the watch for a while , ' Haisman said .
