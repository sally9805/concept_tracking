<p> The Denver Post today presents the fifth installment of a series examining the bedrock industries that built Colorado . We launched the weekly series with a look at Colorado 's railroad and steel industries and followed last week with an overview of the state 's oil and gas industry and coal mining . Today we explore Colorado 's cattle industry , and on Monday the series will look at sheep ranchers . The stories are appearing every Sunday and Monday in the Denver &; the West section through next weekend . We invite you to learn how the state was built by these industries , and about the towns they helped shape . <p> - State and Regional Editor Chris Lopez <p>  --   --   --  <p> CRESTED BUTTE - Cowboys , who provided the beef for pioneers , miners and early railroad crews - and still play a vital role in Colorado 's economy - are leaving their traditional ranges in the high country , replaced by new homes and developments . <p> ' In mountain areas the ranching business is just about gone , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' They measure the price of some mountain properties in square feet now instead of acres . ' <p> Colorado 's 140-year-old cattle business became the state 's largest agricultural industry , and Colorado is the fourth-largest cattle-feeding state in the nation . But the state is losing 1 million acres of cattle land each year to developers and homebuyers , Sharp said . <p> Third-generation Crested Butte and Gunnison rancher Bill Trampe , whose family ranch holdings include 6,000 acres of pastures and hay meadows , knows why . <p> ' At $ 10,000 an acre , any rancher in Gunnison County would be a damn fool to stay , ' Trampe said over coffee in the spacious , sunlit kitchen of the ranchhouse his grandfather built 80 years ago . <p> Trampe 's father bought 1,000 acres for $ 10,000 in 1943 , Trampe said . That same land was recently appraised at $ 10,000 an acre , or $ 10 million . But , Trampe , 53 , says he would rather stay than sell because he enjoys running cattle , growing hay and helping preserve as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ louder than words . <p> A few years ago Climax , the giant molybdenum company , offered to buy the entire Trampe ranch because it wanted 800 acres for a mine tailings pond . Instead of selling , the Trampe family agreed to trade its 800-acre site for two parcels totaling 2,000 acres that were slated for development . <p> Climax bought the land from the developers and gave it to the Trampes in trade . <p> Evading development <p> It is pasture today . The decision to trade , rather than sell , and snatch land from scheduled development , ' was our commitment to the community , ' said Trampe , a founder of the Gunnison Ranchland Conservation Legacy . <p> It has helped seven ranchers put a total of 9,000 acres in conservation easements , protecting them from future development . <p> When the ski resort first opened at Mount Crested Butte in 1963 , ' there were 15 viable ranches between Gunnison and Crested Butte . Today there are only four , ' Trampe said . <p> Three were absorbed by the Ken Spann and Trampe family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out of business or are slated for development as 35-acre homesites . <p> Range rider Barbara East said those 35-acre plots represent the ' worst sprawl ' because they fracture the land with fences and houses and barns , which disrupts wildlife migrations and destroys pastureland . <p> Tensions over cattle drives through residential areas can run high . <p> ' Adults panic , kids scream and dogs attack , ' said Trampe , who recently drove 800 pregnant cows off their fall pasture through a new development known as East River Ranches . <p> And East recalls a homeowners ' association member once asking her , ' When are you people going to learn you do n't belong here ? ' <p> Chris Williams , who lives near Crested Butte , said he does not understand why ranchers continue to graze cattle near his home ' when there are so many tourists in the area . ' <p> But Gunnison County Commissioner Jim Starr said ranching needs to continue because it helps preserve open space , which is important for the tourism industry . <p> Driving stock from Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and visionaries were intrigued by the grazing potential of Colorado 's lush mountain meadows , foothills and prairies . <p> By 1867 , according to the records of the Colorado Agricultural Statistics , there were 147,000 cows and calves in residence . <p> Over the next 60 years , Colorado 's public lands were badly overgrazed , said Jim Miller of the Colorado Department of Agriculture . <p> Cattlemen took advantage of free , wide-open grazing , and the severe overgrazing coincided with both the Dust Bowl days and the passage of the Taylor Grazing Act of 1930 , which was designed to regulate grazing on public lands . <p> Since then , the cattle industry has sought to voluntarily reduce range numbers and improve techniques to give grasslands more time to rejuvenate between grazings , Miller said . <p> Today about two-thirds of the state 's 3.2 million cattle graze on open land . The rest are in 280 feedlots , a method of feeding that began around the turn of the century but became big business by 1930 after Warren Monfort began feeding cattle on an 80-acre plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot was billed as the world 's first 100,000-head feedlot . Monfort later opened two more of the same size near Gilcrest and Yuma . <p> In the early days cattle were brought to the sprawling Denver Stockyards , sold , and walked to adjacent slaughter houses , just as they were in Chicago , Wichita and other major urban cattle markets . <p> Changes in meatpacking <p> But all that began changing after World War II , when Idaho Beef Packers , now the nation 's largest meat packing company , got the novel idea of putting the slaughterhouses out in the country , near the livestock . <p> Monfort opened his first slaughter plant in Greeley , 58 miles north of Denver and near his giant feedlots , in 1960 . <p> Colorado 's two largest meatpacking plants are Montfort 's at Greeley , now owned by ConAgra Inc. , and Excel 's at Fort Morgan , owned by Cargill Foods . Together they employ 4,600 people . <p> Packers save ' everything but the moo and the furry ball at the end of the tail , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant . What about the rest of the tail ? <p> ' Winter is a great time for oxtail soup , ' Chabot replied . <p> Public and congressional concerns about food safety have dramatically changed packing plants , and the entire meat-packing industry is going through major changes that customers will notice in the next five years , according to several industry officials . <p> ' You do n't see meat cutters cutting poultry anymore in supermarkets , ' said Rex Moore , president of Maverick Ranch Lite Beef Inc. of Denver . ' Within five years you will see the beef industry go case-ready , ' meaning the meat will arrive at the supermarket from the packing house ready for display in retail cases , Moore added . <p> Beef , pork and lamb can all be cut for less , and more efficiently , under greater sanitation and microbe control , in a modern meat-processing plant than in the back room of a meat department , Moore said . <p> Moore 's family has been raising beef in the West since the 1880s . <p> His grandfather raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Moore 's father grew up in Denver . <p> They decided to develop their own NatureLite flagship brand of beef in 1985 . <p> Two years later the firm began supplying all three U.S. Olympic training centers . In return , Moore said , Maverick ' is the only beef allowed to carry the Olympic logo . ' <p> Competition among specialty meat producers is fierce . Moore 's 75-page Web site includes information about food safety , steroids , antibiotics and 26 pesticides that it says have shown up in beef . <p> The first major organic natural beef company in modern-day Colorado was founded by Mel Coleman of Saguache 20 years ago . <p> Known initially as Coleman Natural Beef , it has evolved into Coleman Natural Products Co. and grosses about $ 50 million annually , Coleman said . <p> All eight of his great grandparents came to Saguache County before 1880 and all the Colemans have been ' raising cattle , kids and a little bit of hell ' ever since , he said .
