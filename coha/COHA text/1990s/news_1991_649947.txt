<p> The winner of last year 's Nobel Peace Prize , the politician who entranced a gullible world with talk of reform and glasnost , the supplicant we have just given a billion dollars in food aid to help keep in office , the Soviet leader supposedly working behind the scenes to cut a deal in the Persian Gulf  --  has just ordered his tanks into Lithuania to roll over the bodies of patriots resisting his dictatorship . <p> The timing of the brutal and bloody crackdown is no accident ; he knows the focus of world attention is far from the scene of the crime he has long planned . Under cover of the U.N . deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait , Mikhail Gorbachev is using his new Stalinesque power to perform a Stalinist act : to use the Red Army  --  and its elite " black berets , " this generation 's brownshirts  --  to force freedom-yearning people asserting their legitimate independence to submit to Communist rule . <p> The parallel to Hungary 1956 is inescapable . People filled with hope ; an international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crush the freedom fighters . In this case , patriots armed only with sticks barricaded the doors of their television tower with furniture ; a column of 30 tanks and armored vehicles crashed through with ease , rolling over brave bodies in the name of order and annexation . <p> The elected President of Lithuania desperately tried to reach Mr. Gorbachev by telephone ; only a few days before , the Soviet leader falsely assured the republics that a peaceful solution would be found . The dictator in Moscow would not take the call . <p> So much for the apology , sure to be advanced now as it was in Georgia two years ago , that the murder of peaceful protesters took place without Mr. Gorbachev 's knowledge . His hands , we will be assured , are clean ; blame those mean Red Army colonels acting without orders , or that rogue K.G.B. , or the tank-backed quislings who call themselves a " salvation front . " <p> The Soviet media will not show the crushed bodies ; glasnost is finished , having served this regimes 's purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as secondary news in light of the gulf crisis ; we are able to cover two wars and chew gum at the same time . <p> As President Landsbergis urged us to recognize , " This is war . " It is one-sided war , tanks against sticks , but it is not some " internal matter " of the Soviet Union 's , fit only for our cluck-clucking . <p> The United States has never recognized the Russian occupation of the Baltic states as legal . The war raging now is not an uprising , not punishment for separatism ; it is aggression against an independent nation asserting its sovereignty by refusing to allow its occupiers to impress its young men into the Soviet Army . <p> No moral difference exists between " naked aggression " in Kuwait and brutal aggression clothed in a 50-year illegal occupation of Lithuania . There is this practical difference , however : we can not stop this superpower aggression by force of arms . <p> That does not mean the world is helpless , or we should discourage underground resistance by Lithuanian patriots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit reaction to the President 's perfunctory condemnation or John Sununu 's appeasing call for yet more useless " incentives toward liberalization " ? <p> What Moscow 's dictator needs are big disincentives in a hurry . Calling off a summit meeting to avoid shaking a bloody hand , or only cutting off free food aid , is nothing . <p> Step one for the U.S. is to introduce a resolution condemning this aggression in the U.N . Security Council . Let the Soviets veto it ; the Soviet peoples and the Balts will know where the world stands . <p> Step two is for Eastern and Central European nations  --  that includes Germany  --  to call for a special meeting of the C.S.C.E . to condemn the Soviet threat to the peace of Europe . What 's that outfit for , if not this ? <p> Step three is to reaffirm our recognition of the three Baltic nations , to invite ambassadors and to seek diplomatic embassies in Vilnius , Riga and Tallinn . Mr. Gorbachev will say no ; we can wait . So can arms talks . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action requires response . The Soviet Union 's further " support " in the gulf is unnecessary ; its U.N . vote is irrevocable , and it is already shipping arms to Iraq to use against our soldiers . <p> These steps will not free the captive nations , but will heap world disgrace on the Gorbachev regime and give heart to the men , women and children who have shown they are willing to lay down their lives for the right to be free . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : January 16 , 1991 , Wednesday <p> CORRECTION : Because of a production error , a news analysis article on Monday about the effect that Lithuanian developments could have on Bush Administration policies omitted a passage in some copies . The sentence should have read , " Washington has advocated a conference but opposes linking it to the gulf crisis . "
