The 20th century saw more restless experimentation with style and content in art than any other in history . Never before had there been so many ideas about what art could be or how it could be made ; never had new art been the subject of such impassioned controversy or reached so large an audience . Museums , especially in the U.S. , had to embrace newness or look retro . The century did n't see the birth of the avant-garde  --  that had happened earlier  --  but it did bring its death , after experiment and eccentricity became the norm . Inevitably , all that had seemed startling or threatening came to look normal , even classical , within a few decades . In the end , the new lost its power to shock . <P>  --  By Robert Hughes
