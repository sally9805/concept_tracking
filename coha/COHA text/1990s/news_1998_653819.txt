<p> WITH the birth of Euroland less than seven months away , it 's high time for a deep rethinking of how American investors approach Europe . <p> Euroland is popular shorthand for the one-currency , 11-country monetary union and financial market area that will come into being on Jan. 1 . It brings with it many promising opportunities for companies and investors alike . At the same time , it threatens to make some familiar investing strategies obsolete , and it raises the question of whether betting on just this single-currency market is a good idea . <p> Americans have shown a surging interest recently in Europe , with record flows of cash into European stock mutual funds . But the American financial services industry does not appear to be in a rush to change what it is now offering its investors and seems to be ignoring products like a Euroland index fund or a broad choice of actively managed Euroland mutual funds . <p> In fact , some argue that focusing on just the 10 active Euroland stock markets ( Luxembourg has none ) would mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Euroland concept , from a narrow perspective of creating funds , is a flawed one , " said Nicholas Bratt , the head of the global equity group at Scudder Kemper Investments . " We would simply buy the best company we could find in Europe regardless of is specific domicile . " <p> Investors face more questions than just geography . The role that indexes and index funds will play in the new region 's markets is far from certain . And perhaps most important is the developing shift to a new investing style that selects stocks by sector rather than by country . Here is how these themes may play out in the new Europe . Sectors vs . Nations <p> Before Euroland , European equity strategists began by picking a country , based on the forecast for interest rates , growth , earnings and inflation . Then they chose stocks in countries with the best outlook . <p> That system , analysts argue , will not be as effective now , because the new European Central Bank will try to keep interest rates and economic performance more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean there will not be differences within Euroland , but it does mean that the era of making millions by exploiting them is over . <p> " Now it will be what sectors are most promising and what are the best stocks in that sector , " said William P. Sterling , global strategist at BEA Associates , an investment management firm . <p> This new style spells trouble for popular closed-end single-country funds which , unless they adapt , will struggle to produce attractive returns , some analysts say . <p> " It slams the lid down on single-country funds , " said Michael T. Porter , a country fund analyst at Salomon Smith Barney . ( Article , page 6 . ) <p> Exchange-listed American depository receipts , another familiar way for Americans to invest in Europe , should remain attractive . Because they are priced in dollars , trade on American exchanges and conform to American accounting rules , they are easy for Americans to follow . ( Unlisted A.D.R. 's trade over the counter and need not meet American standards . ) <p> As always , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of the underlying European stock and the value of the currency . Monetary union will eliminate the currency fluctuations among member nations , but their shared currency , the euro , will still rise and fall relative to the dollar . <p> Only a minority of top European companies trade as A.D.R. 's , however , and for some investors , the exposure they offer may not be broad enough . <p> For example , the Bank of New York compiles an index of 107 exchange-listed A.D.R. 's for Euroland , but many of the top 10 stocks in market capitalization for each country are missing . The bank is designing a product that would allow American investors to buy the A.D.R. index , but there are no details yet . Seeking a Gauge <p> American investors love index funds , which simply buy all the stocks in a widely followed index like the Standard &; Poor 's 500 . No Euroland analogue yet exists , and creating one will not be easy . One obstacle will be distinguishing for Americans between Europe and Euroland . <p> Dow Jones Indexes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets , has started a family of indexes for Europe and for Euroland collectively called Stoxx . Morgan Stanley Capital International introduced a 335-stock index for Euroland on April 30 . Standard &; Poor 's , The Financial Times of London and Goldman , Sachs &; Company have a 351-stock Eurobloc index , and The Financial Times and the London Stock Exchangehave a 100-stock index . <p> But these companies have been more successful in selling their indexes to fund managers and institutional investors as benchmarks for performance than in bringing index trading to American investors . None has a retail product ready to see daylight , though Dow Jones is promising one . <p> Suzanne M. Crosby , director of global marketing at Morgan Stanley , said , " Marketing Europe from a U.S. perspective is not a big revenue opportunity now . " <p> Not even the Vanguard Group , the index fund leader , has plans for a Euroland fund . " We take a long-term view of things , " said Brian S. Mattes , Vanguard 's spokesman . " It must be a durable investment need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The company does n't think Euroland passes the test . <p> Index investing by country can be done through the World Equity Benchmark Shares , or Webs , traded on the American Stock Exchange ; they are based on Morgan Stanley country indexes . But no pan-European or Euroland Webs are planned . Europe vs . Euroland <p> While there is hardly a rush to offer Euroland plays directly to American investors , plenty of analysts in the United States and Europe are trying to anticipate Euroland 's effects and to spot ways to profit . <p> One is the index effect . The new indexes that aspire to become benchmarks include stocks that received scant attention in the country-picking era but will now be bought simply because of index membership . <p> " The visibility gainers are the ones in the smaller countries like Ireland , Austria , Portugal and Belgium , " said Mark Howdle , European equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney in London . <p> Euroland will also provoke major shifts in existing portfolios , analysts argue . Money managers in specific European countries who view Euroland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across borders . This shift , which seems to have begun , will move prices of many issues . <p> Ian Scott , the European equity strategist at Lehman Brothers in London , noted in a recent report that the weighting for German stocks in a Euroland index would be around 27 percent , but by his estimate , German institutions and money managers now have 70 percent of their assets in German equities . <p> " On this evidence , there is plenty of scope for German institutions to diversify their portfolios , " he wrote . <p> Some analysts argue that smaller-company stocks will be hurt most , as they are sold by money managers to make room for bigger stocks from other countries . <p> Murali Ramaswami , global head of equities derivative research at Lehman Brothers , said that while European stocks in general were becoming more sensitive to industry factors than to country factors , some companies and sectors would continue to be country-sensitive . He found commercial banks in France , Germany , Italy and Spain to be in that category . <p> Conversely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to country : property and casualty insurance in France ; mining , metals and minerals in Germany , and automobiles and utilities in Italy . <p> An increase in cross-border mergers within Euroland will also buoy some stocks , analysts predict , as consolidation picks up speed in oil , construction and  --  especially in Italy  --  in financial services . <p> Consumers taking advantage of monetary union to travel and to buy second homes may help some Euroland companies . On the other hand , the simplification of cross-border comparison shopping may hurt profits of airlines , retailers and brand-name goods makers accustomed to tailoring their prices from country to country . <p> But analysts point out that these factors do not add up to a night-and-day difference between investment opportunities inside and outside Euroland . American mutual fund managers seem to prefer Europe to Euroland as a playing field in both stocks and bonds . <p> Analysts agree that the unified Euroland government bond market will be larger and more liquid than the present array of national markets . But many say it is not an attractive bet right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and junk bonds will take time to develop . <p> Peter Askew , executive vice president of Rowe Price-Fleming International in London , said fixed-income investors would do best in a broader European or international bond fund that can take advantage of European opportunities outside Euroland . <p> Some analysts are betting on Greece , which hopes to join the union in the second round a few years from now . The required sharp cuts in Greek interest rates would mean big capital gains for bondholders , in the kind of " convergence play " that paid off handsomely as Italy and others prepared for Euroland 's birth . ( Article , page 7 . ) <p> N. Graham Allen , the managing director for global fixed-income at Wells Capital Management in Los Angeles , likes Britain , the biggest European player not in Euroland , for the same reason ; he thinks Britain will decide to join before too long . <p> Equity analysts also say it is difficult to ignore Britain . A Euroland stock fund , Mr. Bratt of Scudder Kemper said , " omits the largest stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He said his company 's closed-end New Europe fund also includes emerging markets like Poland and Hungary that he would be loath to exclude by investing solely in Euroland . <p> Stock markets are performing well across Europe , so for American investors , the question of Euroland versus all of Europe may seem academic . The important choice is whether to invest in Europe , by any definition , or not . <p> Europe 's major market indexes have soared in the last year . Charts show year-to-date performance of each market 's biggest stocks , in dollar terms .
