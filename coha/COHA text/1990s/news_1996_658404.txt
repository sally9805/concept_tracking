<p> Traveling down a street of small , worn houses , Kit Danley leans forward as the van slows to a crawl . " Turn here , " she says to the driver , guiding him into a deserted , trash-strewn alley . " We lost three kids to shootings last year , " she says to a passenger , her voice lowering a little . <p> " One kid , Jesse , threw an egg at a car , and it just happened to be a rival gang member 's car , " says Mrs. Danley . " It was n't a terrible thing to do , not really , but they shot him right here . " <p> Looking over the lonely littered alley , Danley , who has been working with troubled teens for a decade , says losingyoung people to violence is all too common now . In fact , she has been tempted at times to quit her work as head of the Neighborhood Ministries for the nondenominational Open Door Fellowship Church . What 's kept her going after more than 10 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrio , " she says , is God-inspired conviction and love for the kids that cuts through the despair . <p> " I think this is what I was born to do , " she says . " When I get discouraged , I remember I 'm doing this for God . Yes , the turnaround is going to take a long time , but imagine if we were n't here . " <p> Danley 's program started as a foodbank outreach program in 1981 and expanded 10 years ago when the needs of children and teens crowded around the church . The church and dozens of volunteers now offer programs throughout the year , reaching out to some 300 children . <p> Danley 's church has also forged a partnership with the bigger Scottsdale , Ariz. , Bible Church . " Their members have been exposed to the reality of this community , " says Danley , " and they want to come here and support the programs . " <p> While most of Phoenix enjoys sun-splashed prosperity , Danley knows the central city as riddled with flourishing gangs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lives of these children are often chaotic and seldom away from danger . <p> Mike McCullough , a spokesman for the Phoenix police department says that of the 244 homicides in the city last year , 80 were known to be gang related . " It was probably higher , " he says , " because drive-by shootings are often unsolved . " <p> Follow the children <p> Danley is undeterred by the violence and chaos . " Our ethos is that we will follow the children , " she says . Indeed , she is well-known for her tenacity in tracking her young charges , whose families may move several times a year or who are passed around to family members . <p> " We go out and get them in buses and vans every Monday night , " Danley says , " and then bring them to the church . We wo n't let them get away from us if we can help it . " Tutoring , games , singing , access to computers , meals , and inspirational talks are all part of the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are safe . " It 's the only place that has stayed the same in my life , " says one gang member . <p> Never give up <p> On a big , white bus making stops along the neighborhood streets to pick up dozens of children one recent night , driver Glenn Johnson says of Danley , " She loves kids . She do n't give up . " <p> Danley explains that the Monday-night program has a leader-to-child ratio of one to five . " The kids call their leader once a week as part of an incentive program , " she says . " We can keep track of them this way , and most of the kids want to come . " <p> Numbers of participants , dollars spent , or programs offered are not the measurements of success here . Rather , success comes with a hug from a boy who earlier refused contact , or communication from a child who was previously silent , or the occasional gang member , battered by gang life , who becomes a Christian . <p> Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in a house where adults buy and sell drugs . For many , even going to school is unrealistic without daily counseling . <p> Danley emphasizes that her program is not designed just to help with the nuts-and-bolts of daily life . " We are not here with just a human message , " says Danley . " If you say things about God to a person at a specific time , it goes in them , and does n't ever leave them even if it takes 10 or 15 years to be evident . " <p> Danley is known among many Phoenix professionals who work with at-risk youth . " She takes these thrown-away kids and tries to help them get away from the gangs , " says Manuel Ramirez , principal of the Alternative Center for Education for the Phoenix School District . <p> Another church volunteer , Lyetta Mathews , pays Danley high praise . " You do n't find many like Kit , " she says . " She is a very good grownup , and it 's an honor to work with her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken in dozens of young people and even families . <p> Victor Lopez , a 15-year-old on probation , was recently released to Danley 's custody . Danley has known Victor and his family since he was a small boy . <p> Mr. Lopez has been in and out of juvenile detention as a gang member . His brother was killed in a gang incident . His father died of alcoholism at a young age , and his mother and sisters are living on an Indian reservation . Victor is also the father of a baby . <p> " I 'm trying to stay out of the gang , " Victor says , seated in a room at the church , looking much older than 15 , and talking so softly and rapidly it 's hard to catch every word . " They officially want to beat me up , hurt me . They ai n't going to let me go , but I ca n't let it bother me , " he says . <p> Danley says gang members lead isolated lives , but often form social - or antisocial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families . " They get together looking for refuge in each other because they have no other resources , " she says . <p> " I used to drink all night and then come home at eight in the morning and sleep all day , " says Victor , who is back in school but struggling with his work . " I wanted to be the hardest gang person there was . I regret what I did to all the people I hurt . There is no one to blame but myself . Kit wants to help me , and I do n't want to go back to my other self because that life was terrible for me . " <p> Asked what he likes about living at Danley 's house with her husband , an ex-football coach with a house-painting business , and two teenagers , Victor says , " No fear . I do n't have to panic and look around like I would on the street , and carry a knife . I try to go by Kit 's rules and listen to her . " <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the right arm eight months ago , coming to the church programs has changed his life . " Here they accept you for who you are , " he says , " and do n't care what you look like . Kit is a really good lady , and has helped me a lot by talking to her . Because of what I 've learned here , I 'm thinking hard about going to college . " <p> A tough road ahead <p> Even while she works to help Victor and other youths , Danley is blunt about the prospects of turning around a generation . " We are trying to unravel generational issues that require a rebuilding in every aspect of a life . We have known Victor since kindergarten , and now we are starting to get involved with his child . " <p> Tony Mata , who works with Danley at the Neighborhood Ministries , describes the dilemma facing many young people here . " They see Mom or Dad taking drugs , and they think it 's okay to do it . They think they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because everybody 's doing it . And we tell them , no , no . You have a choice . There is hope . Then they go home and confront all of it again . " <p> One evening at the church , Mr. Mata faces a group of about 40 teens and pre-teens in a church room . Many are gang members wearing carefully pressed dark pants and black shirts or sweatshirts . The get-together has been filled with laughter and rock music . Now it 's time for the message , and most of the teens have quieted down , sitting on the floor or leaning back in chairs . <p> " Every one of you guys has to deal with something in your life , " Mata begins , " you do n't have two parents , or you wish you had money , or you wish you had n't got pregnant . Maybe if you had n't been abused your life would be better . " <p> The room becomes quieter . Young faces are turning serious . Mata continues . <p> " Check this out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus loves you so much . You know that bad feeling you have inside of you ? " <p> The room is quiet now . <p> " Jesus will take it away for you . If you are serious . All you have to do is ask him , open your heart to God . We give thanks for life because a lot of us here have lost a lot of people . Please , God , be with us the rest of the week . "
