It 's traditional , of course , for us to publish a Christmas story around this time every year , but there 's nothing traditional about the following fantasy . K. D. Wentworth remarks that this story grew out of the observation that - in the hands of some people , religion is as dangerous as a controlled substance . Ms. Wentworth lives in Tulsa , Oklahoma , and-as anyone who has read one of her novels knows , and as you 'll soon see-has an imagination best termed " offbeat . " <p> IT WAS CHRISTMAS EVE and a nasty , strung-out feeling of anticipation filled the air like a cheap deodorizer . I was cruising down the expressway in my squad car , on my way back from disposing of an illegal manger scene erected at the river park . Man , I hate all that insincere , pious yap about " peace on earth , goodwill towards men . " If you let those stupid carols suck you in , you might actually believe the young turks really want to make the world a better place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a Catholic priest for muscling in on their territory , or some Baptists torch a pile of Unitarian hymnals because they do n't have no crosses on the front . Then you understand - it 's denomination eat denomination in this world , buddy , and every priest , shaman , minister , monk , pope , or whatever for themself . I was keeping a sharp eye out for graffiti , you know - " Where will you spend etemity ? " or " Buddha lives ! " - that kind of crap , spray-painted on underpasses right where impressionable schoolchildren could see it . Working the God-beat , of course , I 've seen it all , the pastor-snatchings , the so-called mere " moments of silence " some closet-Lutheran announcer tries to sneak in before a basketball game , the really nasty tricks that can be played on the unwary with a Bible verse stupid to know any better . It all starts with a harmless flirtation , just a weak moment of wondering " what if it 's all true ? " Then your average Joe smuggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe lights a candle in some illicit roadside prayer house , and takes that naive first step down the road to perdition . " I can stop anytime I want , " they say . " I do n't really believe all that stuff . " Yeah , right . Tell it to someone who has n't cleaned up after a baptism gone bad , or seen the havoc twenty whacked-out fanatics can wreak after a really wild first communion . The boys in Washington can legislate against this stuff all they want , but we 'll never be free of it until we stamp out that spineless , sick craving for " absolution " and " the other world . " The last rays of the setting sun were painting the highway a faint rose when I spotted a broken-down van with the metal outline of a stylized fish just above the back bumper . The short hairs crawled up the back of my neck . Them fish guys have been some of my worst busts . As I passed the van , I noted several scantily clad young skirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and called into headquarters . " I got a live one here , maroon Chevrolet van , license number Ida Harry William one five five . It has that fish-thing on the bumper and a bunch of boxes in the back under a tarp . " Static crackled . " Computer says it 's clean , " the dispatcher said after a moment . " But you watch your butt , Al . We 've had sporadic reports of caroling north of Greenwood and most of the units in your area are tied up . " The air was damn cold as I crossed the median , one hand on my gun , just in case they was n't the innocents they appeared to be . My breath turned to white fog and I started shivering . " What 's the problem here , ladies ? " The brunette pouted . I noticed she had a dimple in her chin . She could n't have been more than seventeen . " The engine died , I think . At least it wo n't go and we 're not out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would you take a look ? My dad 's gon na kill me if I do n't get home in time to do my algebra homework . " I pushed my hat back and fought to keep my teeth from chattering . " S-sure thing . " I edged along the van as the traffic whizzed past inches away and eyed the boxes crammed into the back of the van . A bit of goldfringed white fabric hung out of one . It looked familiar , I thought , kind of like a fancy tablecloth my mom used to have , or maybe - an altarcloth ? I kept my cool as I reached the front of the van . " Did you try - " I turned back just in time to see this mondo crucifix descend toward my skull . I ducked , but not fast enough , then a galaxy of lights , all different colors , exploded behind my eyes . " You did n't hit him hard enough , " a tinny female voice complained from far off , Africa maybe , or Mars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to breathe , stupid , " another female answered . " How else is Father Lennie gon na baptize him ? " Alarm seeped through my fogged head . I considered opening my eyes , but could n't seem to find them . My mouth tasted like the weed-choked bottom of one of them government-protected wetlands . " He could just give him last rites instead . " " What good would that do ? " asked the second voice , which had a huskier , more contralto quality . " An altar boy is supposed to receive all seven sacraments . Well , at least six , I guess , if he 's gon na get into Heaven . I guess he do n't need to get married , if he takes holy orders . " Holy orders ... I tried to protest , but only a groan succeeded in making it past my lips . " See ? " the second voice said triumphantly . " He 's fine . " A small hand tilted my chin from side to side and bright-red rockets exploded at the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the living , altar boy . " My eyelids popped open . I stared up through a crimson haze at a face surrounded with black over white , either a woman or the biggest damn penguin I ever saw . " Wha - ? " The head nodded . " Midnight Mass is in ten minutes . You 'd better look sharp , or Father Lennie 'll have your ass . You 'll be on your knees saying Hail Marys until half-past Easter ! " " Now , Sister Prudence , " another female voice said , " do n't scare this poor turd to death , not before he gets himself baptized , anyway . " She giggled . I struggled up to a sitting position , which was blamed hard . My hands was bound before me with a rosary looped tight enough to cut off the circulation and my holster was empty . Damned if they was n't nuns - I should have known better . The fish icon was just a decoy to sucker me in . If I 'd had any inkling I was dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my piece out and called for backup , carolers or no carolers . These jokers have got a real deadly sense of organization . They 'd dumped me in a badly lit warehouse of some sort , crates piled up to the ceiling , and me , sitting there with my back propped against a forklift . The chill from the concrete floor had numbed my legs and I could still see my breath . There was a hint of communion wine in the air as I tugged at the rosary . The damned beads just bit deeper into my swelling wrists . Sister Prudence patted me on the cheek , then dug a nail file out of a backpack and went to work on her black lacquer nails . Each one featured a different Station of the Cross , real hard-core stuff . I began to sweat in earnest . She filed the edges delicately . " Now , all you got ta do is follow Father Lennie down the aisle and light the candles when he says . No big deal . You can do that much even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my training sessions for hostage negotiation , but my throbbing head felt like it had been stuffed with soggy communion wafers . " You ai n't gon na get away with this , " I said . " I radioed headquarters my twenty before I - " " Your twenty ? " the other nun asked . She reached up and tucked a bright pink lock of hair back under her starched black-and-white headdress . " My location . " A muscle twitched under my right eye . " And I called in your tag number too . They ought a be here in about ten seconds . " " Oh , that ! " Sister Prudence dimpled . " Sister Charity steals us a new tag every day . " Sister Charity , she of the pink hair , winked . " Hey , the Big Guy helps those who help themselves . " She shook out a white circle of cloth with a hole cut in the middle . " Here , put your head through this . " I ducked back out of reach . " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said airily . " All altar boys wear them . " " I ai n't no goddamned - " " Well , what have we here , sisters ? " a scratchy male voice on the leading edge of puberty inquired . " A sinner in need of redemption ? " " You betcha , Father , " the two nuns said in unison . They thrust their hands inside their wide sleeves and inclined their heads to this pimplefaced dude dressed all in black , complete with a high black collar and the biggest crucifix I 'd ever seen resting on his concave chest . He had to be all of fifteen . Sister Prudence grimaced . " I knows he 's pretty ancient , but - " " Ancient ? " Sister Charity rolled her heavily outlined blue eyes . " He 's practically morgue-fodder ! " " But- ! " Sister Prudence glared . " those freaking Whittier Baptists from over on Archer Street ran Franky down with their hearse this afternoon . There 's not hardly nothing left of him but a black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She gave me a smoldering look . " This joker 's the best we could do on short notice . " " Poor Franky . " The priest , for that was what he had to be , frowned . " May the Lord have big-time mercy on his soul . " He zipped the sign of the cross in the air , then smiled wide enough I could see his braces , decorated with tiny crosses where the wires intersected . " Never mind , sisters . Our lost brother Franky has gone to a for-sure Better Place , and this poor bastard looks in sore need of redemption . We 'd better do the baptismthing before Midnight Mass rolls around . " They grabbed my arms and hauled me upright . My head began to throb again . The warehouse wavered and my stomach was n't sure what action it wanted to take . I swallowed hard . " Now , wait just a goddamned minute . " I jerked out of their hands and stood there wobbling on my own . " Kidnapping is a felony ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeez , sounds like we 're in serious need of a vow of silence . " Father Lennie whipped out a smudged handkerchief . I staggered backwards against the forklift , prepared to defend myself , but Sister Prudence slipped up behind and threw a choke hold on my neck that would have done credit to a professional wrestler . " There , there , " she whispered into my ear as the warehouse spun and darkened , " it 's for the good of your immortal soul . Someday , you 'll thank ... " When I could see again , the handkerchief was balled and stuffed into my mouth and the white surplice had settled over my shoulders . " Cool ! " The pimply priest rubbed his hands together . " Now , where did I put that vial of holy water ? " Worshippers were filing in , parishioners , I guess they call themselves , hard-bitten regulars too , by the look of them . They all wore suits and hats and ties , even St. Christopher medals . I counted at least five more nuns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger than Father Lennie . They gave me a nervous glance , then seated themselves with an air of expectancy on crates lined up before the cloth-covered altar . Father Lennie slapped first one set of pockets , then another , apparently finding them all empty . " Jeez , I hate it when my mom goes through my pockets ! " Sister Prudence whispered , " You wan na borrow mine ? " He scowled . " Like , how do I know it 's the real stuff ? " She reached inside her robe and pulled out what seemed to be a bottle of Perrier . " Hey , I only buy from Harvey the Saint down on Boulder Avenue . He has visions and everything . " Despite the chill , a drop of sweat trickled down my temple as he held the bottle up to the light , then screwed the cap off and sniffed . I edged back toward the forklift , thinking maybe I 'd find a sharp edge somewhere to cut the rosary beads , then hoof it out into the night and lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just because I could n't muster the proper expression of religious ecstasy on my face . More people streamed in from a door somewhere over on the left . I could n't see it for the crates piled up almost to the ceiling . These new parishioners brushed past me and I noticed they was dressed differently , all in polyester warm-up suits of a white so bright , it half-blinded me , and carrying monster-sized Bibles under their arms . " I guess this stuff is okay . " Father Lennie motioned to me . " Come here , my son , and kneel . " I turned tail and fled . " Oh , no , you do n't ! " Sister Charity tackled me from behind and brought me down , face-first , on the concrete floor . I lay there , my nose scraped raw , the wind knocked out of me , trying with all my might to remember how to breathe . Father Lennie stood over me and poured a healthy dollop of " holy water " on my head . " I baptize thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , padre ! " a male voice boomed . " Put down the funny H20 and nobody gets hurt . " Father Lennie turned on Sister Prudence . " I thought you two posted guards ! " " We did ! " She looked green . " Six of " em , not a day under twelve . " " Jeez , ca n't you nuns do anything right ? " He set the bottle down next to my ear and backed away while " holy water " dripped off my nose onto the concrete . " N-now do n't nobody get nervous , " he quavered . " It 's Christmas . You know - God rest ye merry gentlemen and all that crap . " A ruddy-faced guy , pushing sixty , if he was a day , kicked the holy water bottle aside , narrowly missing my ear . He was wearing one of those white warm-up suits and sporting an AK-47 . " Hallelujah , brethren ! Raise those lily-livered hands over your heads and back up against the wall . " He gestured with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was told . The two nuns followed , hands raised and little pinkies elegantly crooked , real refined . The parishioners mumbled and milled about the packing-crate sanctuary . " I 'm Pastor Buck of the Fifteenth Street Methodists , " ruddy-face said , " and I want to welcome you all to our service . Our sermon for today is " Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you . " Amen . We will now pass amongst the congregation and take up the Christmas offering . " He winked at a silver-haired granny who flashed her dentures in a chilling barracuda smile , then hauled a bronze tray out from under her warm-up jacket and proceeded to shake down the newly formed congregation . I squirmed up into a sitting position , working at the rosary . The cord was just cheap string and I could feel it beginning to fray . Over at the impromptu offertory , one grizzled-looking fellow shook his head as the tray paused underneath his nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife she was packing , which looked to be about right for disemboweling a whale . He flushed and surrendered his wallet . " That 's it , brothers and sisters ! " Pastor Buck 's fat face beamed . " The Lord loveth a cheerful giver . As the Good Book says , we must all give until it hurts . " The rosary cord parted and the damn beads clattered across the floor , calling his attention back to me . I jerked the gag loose and stumbled back onto my feet . " Thstop in the name of the law ! " I lisped , my mouth dry as the Sahara . " Death before excommunication ! " cried Father Lennie , darting forward as the AK-47 wavered toward me . He snatched up the vial of holy water by the neck and smashed it against the nearest crate , transforming it into a jagged bottle top . The old granny with the offering plate squealed like a stuck pig and whipped out her knife . The congregation scattered like chickens fleeing a pack of rabid wolves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hit the floor again , both arms over my head as the recoil from the first round sent him stumbling backwards onto the loose rosary beads . He went down like a poleaxed buffalo as bullets stitched neat holes across the ceiling . My heart was pounding like a steam engine struggling up Pike 's Peak . Common sense whispered that I should just let them shoot it out , then round up the survivors , but unfortunately my job description says " to serve and protect . " I hitched across the concrete on my knees and forearms toward the nearest pile of crates , cursing all the way , wishing those idiots who keep lobbying for legalization of religion as a so-called " victimless crime " could see this mess . Father Lennie and the nuns had mobilized their stunned parishioners into an army of sorts and were now duking it out with gray-headed Methodists in white warm-up suits . The latter were using their oversized Bibles as both shields and bludgeons to middling fair advantage , but Father Lennie and the sisters was laying them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed of the two weapon systems . Pastor Buck must have hit his head when he went down , because he was still sprawled on his back , out cold as a dead mackerel . Just as I reached the dubious cover of the crates , another volley of bullets ripped across the far wall . The two opposing forces hesitated . I could n't see the doorway , but heard a calm male voice say , " Now that I have your most excellent attention , can anyone here tell me what is the sound of one hand clapping ? " Shit ! I pressed my back against the crates . Not a Zen Buddhist ! Anything but that ! They roamed the city alone , rather than in groups , but each one of them was as crazy as the proverbial bedbug . The two rival gangs dropped their Bibles and crucifixes , then backed away , dragging their wounded along with them . I heard bare feet slap across the warehouse floor . " No answers ? My , but you are a dull lot , are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll give you one more chance , before I speed you all on your way to Nirvana - When the Many are reduced to the One , to what is. the One reduced ? " Despite of the gravity of the situation , Father Lennie snickered . " Peanut butter ? " The Zen Master strolled into view . He wore a saffron robe , dropped stylishly off one bare shoulder , and his shaved pate had been polished to the reflectiveness of fine marble . He shook his head gently with an expression of profound regret . " I am sorry to say that answer shows you to be a woeful waste of resources in this world of ever-diminishing supply . " He sighted in on Father Lennie 's head . " May you achieve a much higher state of enlightenment in your next incarnation . " Father Lennie hit the ground and rolled , his pimply face gone the same pasty-gray as the concrete . The Luger spat a line of bullets that chipped through the packing crates above his head . " Act without thinking . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I heaved to my feet . " W-what happens to the hole when the cheese is gone ? . it He turned in my direction and bowed , his blue gaze fixed upon my face . " Nice , " he murmured as he straightened . " I thought no one here had the wit to spar with me . " He cocked his shaved head so that the overhead lights danced across its surface . His eyes glittered with amusement . " Shall we say winner takes all ? " I nodded tersely , though I doubted , despite my misspent youth , that I could actually take him in a Zen koan duel . It had been a real long time and I had done my best to forget all of that . If I did n't try though , we were all dead meat . I squared my shoulders . " What is the color of the wind ? " He smiled . " What is your original face before your mother and father were born ? " " Wh-what ... " My mind went blank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ... " Sensing blood , my opponent advanced upon me , triumph bright in the confident set of his face . " Say one word with your mouth shut ! " I fished in my memory for every day I 'd ever spent on a street corner with my begging bowl , the feel of saffron silk on my naked skin , bare feet walking the icy pavement in the middle of the winter , all the long-buried sensations I thought I 'd put away forever . " Every exit is an entry somewhere else ! " Breathing heavily , I stood my ground . Behind him , I saw the hostages creeping out the door in a steady stream . Another koan or two , and then I would be free to deal with this miscreant on my own . For the first time , he was forced to fumble through his own repertoire and no longer looked quite so confident . Over his shoulder , I saw Father Lennie and the nuns drag two of their fallen comrades out the open door . At least half the Methodists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his breath with a pleased gasp . " If you can not find the truth right where you are , where else do you expect to find it ? " I followed , sezed his shoulder and spun him around to meet a solid right-hand punch to the nose . He wilted to the frozen ground and the Luger went clattering across the parking lot . A hundred yards away , Father Lennie boosted Sister Charity into the maroon van , then hesitated . " You know , I think you got yourself a real serious calling there . Are you sure you do n't want to take holy orders ? " He gave me a big thumbs-up sign , then clambered into the driver 's seat and screeched away . There was no sign of the Methodists or my squad car . I sagged back against the corrugated iron of the warehouse and closed my eyes . Man , I told myself , you 're getting too old for this stuff . You got ta get a different assignment . Returning inside , I tied-up my defeated opponent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communion wafers to munch while I searched for a phone . By the time I found my unit , it had been painted with all the verses of " Oh , Little Town of Bethlehem " and would be out of service at the Division repair shop until a new coat of paint dried , so Dispatch stuck me on milk runs with old Joe Fusco , who 's close to retirement and only answers silent alarms these days . I sit in the passenger seat as we speed toward another electronic hiccup , or some old dame who ca n't punch in her password fast enough , and I ca n't get it out of my mind- " What is the sound of one hand clapping ? " A bead of cold sweat runs down my neck and my hands shake . I knot them together and go over all the stuff I learned down in Rehab after I came off the streets and turned in my begging bowl . One day at a time , as they say . One day at a time .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
