<p> If the marriage of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley was indeed a publicity stunt , both parties should be looking for new publicists  --  the only beneficiaries of this union were Dave , Jay and Conan . From the start , the couple 's credibility was highly suspect : The two took separate vacations ( he with his pre-pubescent pals , she with her ex-husband , Danny Keough ) , lived in separate residences and looked like separate species as they declared their love on ABC 's PrimeTime Live .

( In October , Pill became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the juggernaut rolled on this year , so did the backlash . The charges : that she was the cynical creation of music-industry Pygmalions ; that her pedigree was tainted by her earlier incarnation as the Canadian Debbie Gibson ; that she stole the alterna-rock crown from more-deserving heirs ( Liz Phair , Courtney Love ) ; that she repeatedly misused the word ironic . But the defendant may have been misunderstood . Her first single , the vengeful " You Ought a Know , " got her tagged as another post-feminist rage queeen . But later singles like " Hand in My Pocket " probably reveal her truer self : an earnest , self-absorbed chronicler of teen torment - My So-called Pop Star . <p> After 84 years , the Red-all-over Russian daily Pravda closed . " Our journalists think they can not work and still get a salary , " said its co-owner , blaming the paper 's fall on boozing staffers . We bet Lenin is spinning in his bed . <p> That ol ' Lollapalooza spirit was willing - but not much else was with Perry Farrell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no-shows . Skyrocketing costs knocked plans for 13 dates down to four . Fans who showed up were treated to the Sun Ra Arkestra , Meat Beat Manifesto and Porno for Pyros . <p> Rick " #fJ29237 " James stepped out of a California prison and into a limo after serving two years for some superfreaky felonies ( false imprisonment , assault , supplying cocaine ) . " The old Rick James is dead , " he declared . <p> GWEN STEFANI of No Doubt <p> " Ijust love the classic , old-movie style , as far as the clothes and all that stuff . I love all the cheesy old Hollywood pictures about , ' Oh , I 'm going to be a star ! ' and then it tells the story of this girl who 's gon na be a star , and then she gets discovered , and she gets to be in the powder room and put her makeup on , and have fancy dresses with feathers and stuff like that . They used to go all-out on their productions . And it was all live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films a lot , too . I like the twists that he used on ' Vertigo . ' ' Rebecca ' is just a brilliant movie , too . Really scary , but good . " <p> Al Franken is a Big Fat Liberal , and bed mate Arianna Huffington is a. . . well , why do n't we just stay away from that one . The unlikely team shared a TV bed during Comedy Central 's convention coverage . Contrived , maybe . But a whole lot safer that crawling into the sack with Dick Morris . <p> Half-Elvis , half-Buddha , qawwali master Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan pulled the stars backstage after his Los Angeles-area gig ( Michael Stipe , a camera-shy Madonna , etc . ) . Earlier , Rick Rubin signed the Pakistani to American Recordings . Does this mean he 'll be doing Soundgarden songs ? <p> Phish rolled into Plattsburgh , N.Y. , bringing all their buds - not to mention more than 70,000 fans - for two days of Dead-like jamming known as Clifford Ball .

The soon-to-be annual event came off splendidly despite Porta Potti hell , and the police made few arrests - one for selling counterfeit T-shirts . <p> You 're a normal person . You want your MTV . All you ever get is Road Rules . Shit ! Then you hear MTV just launched a sister channel , M2 . All videos , all the time . No The Real World marathons . Cool ! What ? You need a satellite dish ? Fuck ! <p> BREAKTHROUGH <p> Resurrecting Space Age bachelor-pad music , Swedish pop quintet THE CARDIGANS offer compelling evidence that sometimes sitting back with a martini on a leather couch is your only good option . Their major-label debut , " First Band on the Moon , " delivers bubbly pop that soars with dreamboat female vocals . And if it sounds like the early ' 60s , that 's ' cause the album was recorded with a mishmash of vintage equipment : a 24-track analog board , vibraphones , sitars and old Pernod bottles . Huh ? " The guys in the band like Pernod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it 's a really awful drink - do n't try it . " <p> When the short , eventful life of Tupac Shakur came to an end in September  --  he was gunned down in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas  --  fans and critics alike groped for the larger meaning . To some , the rapper 's death was a simple case of frontier justice . Shakur chose the thug life , and now he had paid the price . Others saw Shakur as a misunderstood artist caught up in the cycle of violence surrounding him . They held him up as yet another symbol , and warning sign , of America 's urban crisis . Even though Shakur 's death showed that sometimes the line between art and death can be a flat one , it may be too early to say gangsta rap is finished : Shakur 's posthumous LP , the tossed-together Don Killuminati , is already platinum , and his Death Row label mate Snoop Doggy Dogg 's new album , Tha Doggfather , entered the charts at No. 1 . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail , the label is being investigated by the FBI , and many listeners are turning to the softer sounds of the Fugees and the post-gangsta Dr. Dre , the title of whose new single summarizes the attitude of many OGs : " Been There , Done That . " <p> BONNIE RAITT : <p> " The most significant event for me this year was participating in the rally to protect the Headwaters forest , in a little town in Northern California called Carlotta . There were about 4,000 people there , and more than 900 of us waited to get arrested . I got arrested , and my dad , my brother and my husband did as well . It was a very moving statement . We 're not talking about never cutting down trees again ; we 're talking about a more-responsible protection and preservation of the old-growth forests . Once these trees are gone , that 's it . They 're not gon na be coming back . " <p> Crowds roared . A reunited Van Halen appeared with David Lee Roth for the first time in 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! In October , news spread that the schizophrenic band was actually hiring ex-Extreme singer Gary Cherone . Roth went back to Vegas . <p> Recently , it 's been easier to see Pearl Jam in Congress than in concert . Putting the war against Ticketmaster aside , the band kicked off its No Code tour at Seattle 's cozy Showbox theater . " Welcome to the R.E.M . album-release party , " said Eddie Vedder , " and the Pearl Jam reunion tour . " <p> We 'd like to thank Mr. Beck Hansen for Odelay , the Album of the Year . Hip-hop beats , ' 70s flash , bad clothes , post-grunge/neofolkie/ hyphen-hyphen-hyphen . He 's Bob Dylan with a sampler , a Beastie Boy with an acoustic guitar . Soon he 'll be shaving , too . <p> BREAKTHROUGH : <p> We agree that Fluffy are not an unattractive bunch . But let 's look beyond that for a moment , shall we : With " Black Eye , " these fishnet-tearing girls have delivered a kick-ass , high-octane punk-rock debut . Produced by Bill Price ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronicles everything from domestic violence to the agony of performing fellatio for the first time . " There are articles in the paper about how I do n't wear knickers , " snipes vocalist Amanda Rootes . " What the fuck does that have to do with anything ? " <p> What did the folks at MTV do when they learned the plight of 71-pound , 19-month-old baby Zachary Strenkert ? Hmm , donate money to research his genetic disorder ? Nope . They cordially invited the infant tabloid staple to attend this year 's MTV Video Music Awards . Next up : fun with cancer . On the bright side , doctors say that Strenkert 's illness is " relatively benign . " <p> After a flaccid presidential campaign , California Gov . Pete Wilson enacted a stiff law sentencing twice-convicted child molesters to chemical castration or surgical removal of the testicles . ( They get to choose ! ) Despite evidence that the little-tested chemical procedure causes side effects from headaches to blood disorders , the bill easily passed . <p> The lessons of Dick Morris , Part 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , your gal pal sell you out , act swiftly . It does n't matter that the tabloids refer to you as a " toe-lick guru . " Sign a book deal . Triangulate . In the end , nothing matters ; it 's all just strategy , anyway . You 're still a genius . Act like one . That 's all you got left , pal . <p> GI Joe falls out of a T. rex 's mouth , jumps into a red sports car and steals Barbie from Ken . Old-school Van Halen soundtrack . Kindly Japanese man smiles . Prime-time haiku . Ad of the year . <p> Bob Dylan 's inscrutable son Jakob and his band , the Wallflowers , delighted the suits at an Armani bash with the group 's breakthrough tune , " 6th Avenue Heartache . " " They said Clapton and the Fugees would be there , " said Jakob of his motivation . " We did n't debate much further . " <p> MAKE - OVER <p> In case you did n't know who that woman in the SHERYL CROW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's Sheryl Crow . Really . After winning three Grammys in 1995 , the rootsy Deadhead-next-door traded in her curly locks and cutoffs for a high-fashion , glam look of the moment . The hair was blown straight , the fitted suits shine , and the makeup , well , there 's just more of it . Crow released " Sheryl Crow , " an impressive collection of gritty barroom tunes ( is this ironic ? ) . Giving her hip new cred , Wal-Mart banned the album , and Crow joined the ranks of mavericks Nirvana and Jane 's Addiction . <p> Madonna 's actual child-rearing tips for her baby , Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon : ( 1 ) Forbid all persons near pregnant mother from using profanity ; ( 2 ) strict Catholic upbringing ; ( 3 ) no Sex ( the book ) until the child is of legal age . <p> In presenting this record , we hope . . . the music we made is once again brought to the forefront , " wrote Krist Novoselic inside Nirvana 's live retrospective , From the Muddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall away like yellow , aged newsprint . Crank this record up . " <p> It started like a " Friends " episode . When TV 's best-loved latte sippers banded together to demand a pay hike this summer , it echoed their show 's " I 'll be there for you " theme . That the raise they asked for was $60,000 per episode did n't exactly jibe with other themes ( " Your job 's a joke ; you 're broke " ) , but many industry insiders agreed that with the show primed to make $4 million per episode in syndication , the actors deserved a bigger slice of the pie . Besides , such contract renegotiations are routine ; this one was unusual only in that ( 1 ) it went public , and ( 2 ) it was a group effort  --  at least for a while . In August the unified front reportedly broke down when David Schwimmer , with an eye toward his promising movie career ( you know , um , The Pallbearer ) , reportedly balked at committing to a sixth year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a Seinfeld than a Friends . In October , a deal was finally struck , and the cast got most of what it wanted . But will Chandler be spitting in Ross ' latte when he 's not looking ? <p> ANI DIFRANCO <p> " Love is my new hobby . It 's never something I 've spent too much time with before , but being madly in love is kind of my hobby now  --  like needlepoint but stickier . My last album was really tortured . Then my relationship took a turn for the better , and now I 'm just busy being blissful . That takes a lot of time . The biggest change is having somebody to talk to . I find the need for fewer hobbies because I 'm not so desperately alone . We met after I put an ad in ' Juggs ' magazine , saying , ' Busty , bald folkstress seeks dubiously gendered crazy person for fun and fantasy . ' " <p> Whoever said cheaters never prosper did not have outfield seats for Game 1 of the American League Championships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a day after reaching over the Yankee Stadium fence and scooping up the fly ball that became a game-tying home run . " I 'm not as famous as the Yankees , " said the media-savvy kid to a pack of reporters . " The players deserve the credit . " Maier plans to spend the winter at Knicks games tripping opposing players at midcourt . <p> After 18 years of companionship and three children , Jerry Hall , irked by tabloid reports of Mick Jagger 's affairs , consulted divorce attorney to the royals Anthony Julius . Experts predict that Hall will receive millions and Jagger will receive a model to be named later . <p> Come out , come out , wherever you are . Since word leaked out that Ellen DeGeneres ' TV persona might reveal that she is a lesbian , viewers have had their eyes on the closet door . To clear up the confusion , DeGeneres told David Letterman that her character will actually learn she is Lebanese . <p> BREAKTHROUGHS : <p> The Beatles had the Maharishi ; these four Brits have Kula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name  --  as a good-luck charm . It worked : The band 's shimmering debut , " K , " reached No. 1 in England . On " K , " the group also uses South Asian tablas and the tamboura , Indian mantras and helpings of Sanskrit to augment Kula Shaker 's swirling guitars and catchy melodies . <p> BREAKTHROUGHS : <p> Cross Alice Cooper with " Faces of Death " and what do you get ? Marilyn Manson . Lounge music for serial killers , the splatter opera " Antichrist Superstar " brought theater-of-blood spectacle back to rock  --  and some good rumors , too : Manson worships the devil , is ordained to perform Church of Satan weddings , is getting a breast implant in the middle of his chest . <p> Forget Clinton vs . Dole . The real race this year is Courtney LOVE vs . MADONNA . With the back-to-back releases of The People vs . Larry Flynt and Evita in December , insiders are predicting a pop-driven Oscar battle . It 's a weirdly symmetrical matchup  --  two iconoclastic divas playing controversial real-life characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinvention yet  --  as a grown-up . With all the hype surrounding Evita  --  get ready for the Peron Look , coming to a mall near you  --  Love might seem like the underdog , but her performance as Larry Flynt 's drug-addicted partner in porn has been called " beyond belief . " One observer claimed she " blew away " 500 viewers at a West Coast screening  --  without cursing or throwing things at any of them . And Love seems to be working on her own make-over , toning down her bad-girl image ( see Page 90 ) . Still , the Academy might not be thrilled with either choice . Could n't that nice Emma Thompson have made a movie this year ? <p> Bob Dole rounded up some cutting-edge entertainment for a rally in Loma Linda , Calif. : the Oak Ridge Boys and the Osmonds ( guess Fugazi was booked ) . Seventies " It " girl Bo Derek also attended . " I 'm trying to get on Bo Derek 's bus , but it 's filled , " said the sly , old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you answer the door . Cash wanted a backing band for the rollicking , spiritual Unchained , so he recruited Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers to help cover songs by Beck ( the excellent " Rowboat " ) , Soundgarden and the Carter Family . <p> NORM MACDONALD of " Saturday Night Live " <p> " I was watching House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt on C-SPAN , where he appeared to discuss the pros and cons of the line-item veto with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott , and they went on to have a spirited debate on subjects ranging from immigration reform to the balanced-budget amendment . It might have seemed to be a dry half-hour of political discourse to many viewers , but I found it most enjoyable . It should be noted , however , that I was receiving oral sex from a crack whore at the time .

Finally , Prince 's protege Carmen Electra was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black co-workers charming monikers like " fucking niggers " and " black jelly beans . " The fucking white guys then had to pay out a $176 million settlement . <p> Jimmy Buffett spoke at a rally for a tax on Florida 's sugar growers to help restore the Everglades . On the whole , voters preferred cheeseburgers to paradise : They rejected the amendment but backed establishing an Everglades trust fund . <p> Bruce Springsteen and the Rev. Jesse Jackson led thousands at a demonstration near UCLA against Proposition 209 , the California state ballot initiative that would outlaw many affirmative-action programs . Unfortunately , it passed . <p> MAKE-OVERS <p> Dr. dre made some changes in his life . The ever-morphing producer left Death Row Records , of course , but there 's . . . something else . There is more than a hint of  --  dare we say  --  suaveness in his new look . Dre eschewed his street gear for swanky tailored suits . Check out his new video for " Been There , Done That " : The man steps out of a helicopter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but a G thing , indeed . <p> MAKE-OVERS <p> Part of COURTNEY LOVE 's appeal is that she 's such a mess . Observe 1995 's Love on the left : bed-head hair , thrown-on makeup , where-am-I ? expression , the occasional zit . Now look right . Who 's the politician 's wife ? What 's with the neat hair , the careful makeup , the demure jewelry , the meek expression ? " I 'm not very good at asserting myself , " she said recently . Huh ?
