Stuart has to draw a fine line with his roommate Palmyra . For example , right now she wants him to go out and call their apartment from a pay phone . <p> Her plan is simple : she phones the man she loves like no other , the Gorton Fisherman , and Call Waiting ( that will be Stuart , from the cold and rainy corner phone booth ) interrupts . At that point , Palmyra can say breezily to the Gorton Fisherman , " Well , I 'm going to take this call , call me later , " and the ball will be in his court . <p> " So in effect you 're just leaving a message , " Stuart says . <p> " Well , yes , " Palmyra says , biting her red lips . " I have to . He does n't have an answering machine . " She crosses the room , green silk pajamas swishing , and calls Gorty  --  nicknamed by Stuart because of a summer he spent on a fishing boat  --  to make sure he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , Stuart . " <p> Stuart lounges against the desk in the living room . " You should n't call and hang up so much , " he says . " How do you know he does n't have some kind of Caller ID ? " <p> Palmyra chews her thumb nervously , and , as though on cue , the phone rings . " Oh , my God , " she says , stricken , and collapses dramatically backward onto the couch . Her green pajama top rides up to give Stuart a heart-stopping view of the curve of her breasts . <p> The call is a wrong number and chances are Palmyra will ask Stuart at least once more to call from the corner phone booth and this is where he must draw the line . Because this is the only power Stuart has over Palmyra , this is , unfortunately , all she wants from him . <p> If he can help it , Stuart does not allow Palmyra to draw him into discussions about her looks , although privately he thinks she would be amazingly beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She has the most interesting face Stuart has ever seen , her mouth is a trifle too wide , her nose a little too pointed . She spends a lot of time rolling her shoulder-length ash-blond hair , curling and darkening her eyelashes , painting her lips with bright red lipstick . As a result , she looks like an interesting-looking person wearing a lot of makeup . She also looks strangely dated , a 1940s movie star , Veronica Lake , maybe . <p> Palmyra is twenty-five , three years older than Stuart , and is actually Stuart 's brother 's roommate . This is actually Stuart 's brother 's apartment . Stuart is staying here only for a few months until he begins a year as an exchange student in Switzerland and his brother returns from being a forest ranger in Wyoming . Stuart has many fantasies about his brother 's return , all of them involving Stuart 's moving into Palmyra ' s room with her . Stuart does not know whether his brother found Palmyra potentially amazingly beautiful or not , but the fact that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to believe that probably his brother did , probably his brother loves her , too . <p> Palmyra works at a domestic violence shelter . <p> That sentence is a marvel to Stuart , he can not get enough of thinking about it , wondering at it , imagining scenarios : An exhausted , injured woman limps into the office and there 's Palmyra , cosmetics spread out in front of her , frowning into a mirror . The woman starts to tell Palmyra about her life . Palmyra interrupts , No , listen to this , I saw Gorty in the store yesterday and he was buying candles . What do you think that means ? <p> The fact that Palmyra got the job by sleeping with the married man who runs the shelter does not tend to alter his view . When Palmyra comes home from work , she throws her black felt hat across the room and runs her fingers through her hair like she just got out of the shower . " Oh ! " she says . " Oh , I 'm so glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , she may hug him , so Stuart is always there . <p> Stuart must , of course , be nice to Palmyra 's father when he drives in from Connecticut to bring Palmyra her childhood chest of drawers . Stuart helps him battle it up the stairs , through the living room , and into Palmyra 's bedroom . At one point , the chest of drawers begins slipping and Palmyra 's father shouts , " Watch the north end ! Watch the north end ! " The north end ? thinks Stuart . How is he supposed to tell north and south apart in an emergency ? <p> Palmyra spends a leisurely half-hour doing her hair , and afterward she gives them each a glass of iced tea . She leans against the kitchen counter . She has completed her hair and makeup routine , but is still wearing her nightgown . Her legs are the color of honey . <p> Palmyra ' s father swallows noisily and says , " So do I get to meet the Brawny Paper Towel Man ? " <p> " The Gorton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess he is nearly as handsome as the Brawny Paper Towel Man . " " Do you think so , too , Stuart ? " Palmyra 's father says . " I hope there 's not going to be any competition here . " <p> " Competition for what ? " Stuart says . <p> Palmyra 's father laughs , a bluff , uneasy , dad sort of laugh and changes the subject . <p> It is a full five minutes before Stuart realizes that Palmyra 's father thinks he is gay . Later he shares his insight with Palmyra . He has to interrupt because she is chattering on about her new plan to tell Gorty that she just wants to be friends . Stuart is interested despite himself . " Why tell him that ? " he asks . " It could n't be further from the truth . " <p> She waves her hand dismissively . " It 's all part of playing hard-to-get , " she says . " Men are so stupid . Anyway , what did you just say about my dad ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Oh , because of that competition remark ? " she says . " I 'm sorry . He just  --  well , any man that I 'm not openly hoping to seduce , he thinks is gay . " She turns away from him and walks toward the phone , eager to play hard-to-get . And if Stuart can think of anything to say , he will by all means speak up . <p> Stuart agrees to teach Palmyra to play pool . She wants to learn because Gorty plays , she wants to be the perfect date , prepared for anything . <p> Invariably , Stuart pictures putting his arms around Palmyra as he instructs , her torso bent over the floodlit green felt , her shirt smooth and tight on her back , outlining the knobs of her spine  --  the rest of the bar watching enviously . Of course , then Stuart realizes that the rest of the bar consists of better pool players who will all want to teach Palmyra themselves , but he tries not to dwell on this . Palmyra is convinced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and dating as we know it will grind to a halt . No one will ever call anyone new because they wo n't have the luxury of hanging up . " Only people already involved in serious relationships will go out , " she says . " Either that , or we 'll do some sort of Amish thing and walk by each other 's houses . " <p> The more she thinks about it , walking by Gorty 's house seems like a good idea . Stuart goes with her , and it becomes their routine , a midnight stroll by Gorty 's apartment in the hopes that he will wander out and  --  and what ? Even Palmyra seems a little shaky on this detail . <p> Nevertheless she wears an old yellow rain slicker , a gift from Gorty ( actually , he was throwing it out and said she could have it ) . If it is cold , she wears a green scarf knotted around her neck  --  a half-hitch , Gorty told her once . Stuart must resist mocking this , tempting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorty , is sacred . <p> Palmyra is a little irritable on these walks because she 's afraid Stuart wo n't make himself scarce fast enough if they spot Gorty . But often when they are safely past his house , Palmyra slips her hand into the crook of Stuart ' s arm , a movement so natural and guileless that he can hardly believe it 's Palmyra doing it . <p> Stuart does not criticize Palmyra when Adele , one of the battered wives  --  " Battered women , " Palmyra corrects  --  from the shelter calls to tell her that while she , Adele , is staying with her husband , she wants Palmyra to come and rescue her cockapoo . <p> " Adele , I do n't have time for this , " Palmyra says , and hangs up . Stuart is momentarily elated : so this is what Palmyra says to battered wives ! <p> The reason Palmyra has no time for Adele is that she is talking about how last night Gorty 's hand brushed against her back  --  wait , let 's get this straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been a pass , it could also have been accidental , he was reaching for a box of pretzels . She is wearing a short cotton nightgown and Stuart is trying to estimate the amount of time Palmyra is actually dressed . <p> Now she frowns and says , " I think I 'll tell Adele to bring her dog over in a cab . " She makes the call and then paces . For a moment Stuart is touched by her concern , but then she says , " Now I can tell Gorty I have to walk this dog in the park late at night and I need him to come with me . " <p> Stuart offers to leap out of a tree at a predetermined time and place and threaten Palmyra so that Gorty can really feel like he is protecting her . <p> " Oh , good idea ! " she says . <p> " But , " Stuart says , leaning back and watching her , " what if he pulls out a gun ? " <p> " Then I 'll have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughs at his expression , and this is a scary moment for Stuart , one in which he suspects that she sees everything in his freckled face . <p> Lionel , Palmyra 's married-but-separated boss from the domestic violence shelter , stops by late one night with a carton of Rocky Road . <p> He is about forty , balding , stocky as a box , sweet as Santa . He calls Palmyra " Palmie , " and makes her laugh at a story about the time he got his hand stuck in the toilet reaching after his dropped toothbrush . His hand covers the back of her neck as she spoons ice cream out of a coffee cup . <p> Stuart is horrified . How can Palmyra permit this ? She is supposed to be saving herself for Gorty , not to mention Stuart himself , although of course she does n't know that part about Stuart yet . <p> Eventually Lionel and Palmyra go into her room . Stuart imagines spread-eagling himself across the doorway , shouting Wait a minute ! Let 's talk this over ! as Palmyra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he cleans the kitchen and goes to bed . As he is trying to fall asleep , he hears Palmyra say , " Oh , gosh , " in a voice indistinguishable from her speaking voice , " Oh , gosh , Lionel . " <p> Stuart turns over heavily in bed and puts his arm around Adele ' s cockapoo , wishing that he were a different kind of person . One who smoked  --  like Palmyra  --  who would go up on the roof at a time like this and smoke one cigarette after another , watching the tips glow in the dark , red as lipstick , hot as tears . <p> The Gorton Fisherman calls one night about midnight , while Stuart and Palmyra are making hot cocoa , and says he 's on his way over with a bottle of wine . What is it with men and late-night gifts ? Stuart thinks . He does n't ' t have to pretend to be happy for Palmyra because she is happy enough for herself . She leaps from the lotus position to her feet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . <p> Hey , that 's good , Stuart wants to say , that 's the way you 're supposed to sound when you 're having sex . <p> Palmyra paces . " What am I going to wear ? " <p> " Palmyra , " Stuart says . <p> She pays him no mind , goes into her room and begins flinging negligees onto her bed . " The peach , " she says decisively . " Or the pale blue . Oh , Stuart , what do you think ? " <p> " I think , " Stuart says , " I think there 's only one reason a guy comes over to a girl 's house at midnight . " <p> Palmyra beams . " I sure hope so , " she says . <p> Stuart is momentarily silenced by this . He pretends to give serious thought to which nightgown Palmyra should wear . After a while , he says , " I guess I ' 11 go around the corner and get a beer or something . " <p> Palmyra smiles at him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look so grateful and relieved . <p> A girl at the bar says , " Hey I know you , you come with the beautiful blond . " <p> She says come with as though Stuart is a complimentary gift of some sort that accompanies Palmyra , or maybe an integral part of her , inseparable , her arm or something . <p> The girl , who is sort of pretty in an ordinary un-Palmyra way , buys Stuart 's third beer . He thinks that he could stay out all night , buy this girl breakfast in some diner and come back in late in the morning after Gorty is gone . But Palmyra jealous ? Stuart rejects that almost as he thinks of it . Once before he stayed out all night and in the morning Palmyra said , " Your father and I were very worried , " and laughed until a pink foam roller fell out of her hair . <p> Besides , Stuart has to be home fairly early to walk Adele 's cockapoo . The cockapoo , Stuart is beginning to realize , is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves Gorty , and it seems that Palmyra will love Gorty forever . The next morning Stuart wakes Palmyra up with breakfast in bed : French toast with powered sugar and syrup . He does this partly because he needs to know what happened last night and partly just to see Palmyra in her nightgown . <p> " Oh , wow , " she says when he settles the tray on her lap . " Oh , how wonderful ! " <p> She would be the most beautiful girl in the world right now if she were wearing an old college T-shirt and no makeup . Instead she is wearing the peach nightgown , the straps made of creamy lace , a little cluster of pearls sewn into the fabric , all of it clashing with her fuchsia nail polish . Her mascara clumps her eyelashes together . She looks like an aging starlet . <p> She eats triangles of French toast happily , prattling on about some look Gorty gave her . Stuart has to interrupt to ask if Gorty slept over . <p> " Oh , my goodness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a move now , he 'd know I was n't serious about being friends . " <p> " You are n't , " Stuart says . <p> She ignores this . " I can wait forever , though , " she says dreamily , " I have the patience of a saint . " <p> When Lionel comes over again , Stuart finds new ways to occupy his time : he cooks an elaborate meal , assembles his shoe rack , shampoos and brushes Adele 's cockapoo . He does the dinner dishes noisily , splashing , singing , but he can still hear Palmyra pipe up conversationally from her bedroom . " That 's it , " she says , not the breathless , passionate voice you might expect , but the voice of <p> woman suddenly solving a math problem , " Oh , Lionel , that 's it . " <p> Stuart is industriously cleaning under the stove burners when Palmyra walks Lionel to the door and then comes into the kitchen in her robe for a glass of water . She spills some on his freshly wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling a new sense of purpose in this role as housekeeper , fixer of messes . <p> " Lionel ' s going back to his wife , " Palmyra says , " which is good , because , you know , I 'm not in love with him or anything . " Stuart noncommittally rubs oil into the cast iron frying pan . <p> " Not like you are with the Gorton Fisherman , " he says at last . <p> " No , nothing like that , " Palmyra agrees . <p> She comes between Stuart and the counter and slips her arms around him , his friend again , eager for his attention . She rubs her nose against his shoulder . Stuart slips a hand over her hair , heavy and glossy as fabric . " Lionel gets on my nerves , " she says , " but he is the dearest man , do n't you think ? " <p> " Oh , yes , " says Stuart , quite as though he has not been planning Lionel 's earthly demise for the past two hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thirty . Stuart is face to face with him finally one night when he gallops out of his bedroom to greet Palmyra and finds her arm in arm with Gorty who , he realizes now , he has been vaguely picturing as grizzled and leather-skinned , perhaps with a wooden leg . Stuart had hoped people called Gorty an old salty dog . <p> Instead he is intimidatingly vital and dark-haired , not so much older than Stuart and Palmyra , and as she runs off to change , Stuart thinks that he and Gorty would make a good Before and After picture for something . If Gorty is the Brawny Paper Towel Man , Stuart is one of the kids from the Applejacks cereal box . Stuart tries not to think what Palmyra 's father would say if he saw the two of them . <p> " So , uh  --  " Stuart realizes that he can not remember Gorty 's real name and Palmyra will scalp him if he says Gorty . " So , what do you do ? " <p> " I 'm a fisherman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " An architect , " Gorty shouts , doubtlessly believing that Stuart has been rendered hard of hearing by birth or accident . <p> The pool-playing lessons begin at a bar and Stuart and Palmyra both drink a lot of beer and he discovers that Palmyra becomes even prettier as she gets drunk , her eyes look sleepier , she loses her edginess . She usually has ramrod-straight posture , but she is actually slouching , the top three buttons of her purple shirt undone . <p> She is very possibly the worst pool player Stuart has ever seen . The lessons do n't work out too well , they end up playing an extremely lopsided version where the objective is for Stuart to sink all the balls before Palmyra can sink even one . He still wins about half the time . <p> On the way to the door , a man at the bar takes Palmyra 's arm . " You are n't leaving ? " he says . " I could teach you to play pool . " <p> " No , thanks , " Palmyra tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold enough to drop an arm over her shoulders . " I 'm glad you did n't stay , " he says . <p> Palmyra snorts and spins away , walking along the curb with her arms carefully extended . " Why would I stay ? " she says . " It was n't Gorty , it was just a man . " <p> Stuart must keep drawing the line . One night he and Palmyra and Adele 's cockapoo see a girl going into Gorty 's apartment building . Palmyra is convinced that the girl is going to see Gorty . " Oh , no , " she says . " Oh , no , I knew I should n't have told him that I want to be friends . " <p> " Palmyra , that could be anybody , " Stuart says . " She could live there . " <p> " A light just went on in his apartment ! " Palmyra shrieks . Her hair is wild around her face from the wind . " Look , here ' s what I need you to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver it . Just see if she 's there . " <p> " That is the dumbest plan I 've ever heard of , " Stuart says . <p> " I 'll buy the pizza , " Palmyra says recklessly . " I 'll pay you fifty dollars . Oh , come on , please . " <p> " Absolutely not , " Stuart says . " You know he 's seen me and  --  " <p> Too late he realizes that Palmyra is on the verge of tears . " You ca n't do this one thing for me ? " she says , voice wavering . " Oh , forget it ! " Her voice rises and people on the sidewalk turn to look . Even Adele 's cockapoo , who has probably heard a lot of raised voices in his life , watches . " Forget it , forget it , forget it ! " She turns and runs back toward home , the ridiculous rain slicker flapping around her ankles . Palmyra is angry with Stuart , but the distinctly terrible part of this is that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palmyra is in her room with the door shut and she leaves for work the next morning before Stuart wakes up . He does n't know whether she 's still angry , but he thinks about it that day while he waxes the kitchen floor . <p> He makes macaroni and cheese for dinner , but she does not come home . He does the dishes and goes out for hot cocoa ingredients , but still she does not come home . <p> Midnight finds Stuart and Adele 's cockapoo gazing up at Gorty ' s window where a light is shining ominously . Stuart pictures Palmyra up there , smiling at Gorty , laughing merrily at his jokes . He doubts Gorty has ever told a single good joke . Nonetheless he listens intensely and thinks he can make out her laugh , high and clear and silvery- <p> " Stuart ? " <p> He turns and sees Palmyra , a bag of groceries on her hip . He knows immediately that she has not been with the Gorton Fisherman at all , she has merely had a long day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale without lipstick , her mascara long since rubbed away . The ever-present yellow slicker even draws the shine out of her blond hair , which hangs lankly around her face . She is more beautiful than she could ever hope to be , and Stuart 's love for her rears over him like the shadow of a tidal wave . <p> Palmyra must see it in his face . She steps closer and looks as if she would like to take his pulse . And although when she speaks , her tone is surprised and almost clinical , with no smile to soften it , and her meaning beyond interpretation , Stuart thrills to her words . " Why , " Palmyra says , " you look beautiful , standing there . " <p>
