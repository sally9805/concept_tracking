" He 's mine ; she has to deal with that now , " said Tasha on the Ricki Lake show last week . Tasha , married to Ed , was railing against Becky , Ed 's ex-girlfriend , who she claimed was trying to come between them . After Tasha and Ed told their story , Becky came onstage , and things really went wild . <P> " Well , to begin with , they done nothin ' but lie since they been up here , " she said , launching into a tale about one time when she went to Ed 's house to pick up their daughter . " He started callin ' me a nasty little bitch and everything else ! " Becky was saying when Tasha leaped to her feet . With the studio audience roaring , the two women began screaming at each other , standing nose to nose , fingers jabbing the air , the bleep machine struggling to keep up . The last decipherable exchange : " Shut up ! " " You shut up ! " <P> By this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the self-satisfied authority of a second-grade teacher . " Excuse me , excuse me , " she broke in . " We do n't say shut up to anyone . This is an open arena . We will all be heard , and we wo n't use the bad language , O.K. ? " <P> O.K. , Ricki , but without uproars like these , you would n't have the hottest show on daytime television . Ricki Lake , now syndicated on 212 stations across the country , has more than doubled its ratings in the past year , moving up to second place among all the gabfests , trailing only the still dominant ( but slightly weakening ) Oprah . Ricki has succeeded by putting a fresh twist on the overworked format : catering to teens and young adults with shows about screwed-up relationships , and juicing up the hour with high-decibel confrontations that draw hoots and cheers from the studio audience . The emotional circus really has come to town , and Lake-the once obese co-star of John Waters movies and the TV series China Beach-is the pudgy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been enormous . Such competitors as Jerry Springer , Jenny Jones and Montel Williams have gravitated toward her subject matter and her high-pitched style-and have seen their ratings jump . Their shows can not match Lake 's youthful demographics , but several Ricki clones being introduced this week at the annual convention of the National Association of Television Program Executives are getting ready to try . Among them are Carnie Wilson , formerly of the singing group Wilson Phillips , another talk-show neophyte who has to watch her weight ; former Cosby Show kid Tempestt Bledsoe ; ex-Partridge Family cast member Danny Bonaduce ; and Mark Walberg , whose publicity pitch begins , " If Donahue were 30 years younger , and Ricki were a man . " Rick Jacobson , president of Tribune Syndication , which has just launched the Charles Perez show , hosted by a hunky former Ricki Lake staff member , admits the influence . " Obviously , " he says , " you look at the success of a Ricki Lake and you say , ' Boy , we should be doing that . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volume and turning on kids . Her show has pioneered a new approach to TV talk . Gone , for the most part , are the wacky transvestites , the bizarre tales of incest , the tearful aids victims . The stories Ricki and her imitators go for concern painful relationship problems , the kind everyone can relate to : guys who wo n't commit , women whose boyfriends cheat , couples who argue over in-laws , girlfriends who fight over men .
