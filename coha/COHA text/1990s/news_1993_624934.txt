<p> WASHINGTON - " " Florence can probably do lunch Wednesday , unless she has to give a press conference . Then she 'll have to reschedule lunch for Thursday , but that 's contingent on whether she 's lunching at the White House with the president . " <p> Kathy Campanella , the publicist for Florence Griffith Joyner , the newly appointed co-chairwoman of the President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports , sounded flustered as she politely explained her client 's frenetic schedule . <p> Taking a deep breath , she tried again : " " Let 's see . Breakfast Friday is a possibility , but she 's scheduled to jog with the president . Next she 's taping a segment on " " Good Morning America . " Maybe she can squeeze you in before she takes off for California . " See Florence Griffith Joyner . See Florence run . Running to Capitol Hill . Jogging along the Potomac River , slowing her pace so as not to embarrass the president - never mind that her husband , Al Joyner , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after jogging three miles . At least Clinton went the distance ( four miles ) . <p> By the time a reporter caught up with the fleet-footed Olympic sprinter , Griffith Joyner was seated - momentarily - in the back seat of a limousine that was shuttling her to Dulles Airport . <p> But even at rest , Griffith Joyner seemed propelled by her own kinetic force , as though she could easily bolt from the limousine at the next red light and jog to the airport herself . <p> She was certainly dressed for it , in running shoes and delicate gold jewelry , and a bubble-gum-pink and white jogging outfit that she designed and that bears her trademarked nickname , FloJo . <p> " " Sorry about all the confusion , " she said in her soft , low voice . " " You just ca n't have previous engagements . That 's the toughest thing about being here in Washington . No schedule is set in stone . " <p> In fact , spending four days in the nation 's capital reminded Griffith Joyner of the 1988 Olympics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . <p> Viewers of the Olympic Games in Seoul , South Korea , remember Griffith Joyner as the Amazonian beauty attired in a vivid one-legged sprint suit , with hair flowing and 3-inch nails elaborately painted , dashing her way into fame and the record books . She won three gold medals in the 100 and 200 meters ( the latter in world-record time ) and the 400-meter relay and a silver in the 1,600-meter relay . <p> She retired less than six months later , and although she has been busy acting , writing books and designing her own line of sportswear , she seemed to quietly fade into memories of videotaped replays . Settling beside her husband in the stretch Lincoln , she looked smaller and more delicate than she appears on television and in photographs . Though 5 feet 7 inches tall , she seems rather petite , having lost 14 pounds off her 139-pound , fine-boned frame in preparation for the marathon in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta . The 3-inch nails have been trimmed to 2 inches , all done up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her jet-black hair is arranged in a sleek bun that accentuates her high cheekbones , almond-shaped hazel eyes and unblemished Cover Girl skin . <p> She appeared uncomfortable talking about herself to a stranger , more like the shy little girl who grew up in a four-bedroom apartment in a housing project in the Watts section of Los Angeles , the seventh of 11 brothers and sisters , rather than the sophisticated corporate speaker who has commanded fees of $ 20,000 an appearance and gathered commercial endorsements that brought her $ 4 million or so . <p> Griffith Joyner , 33 , is used to being recognized , although it 's not always as FloJo . <p> Not Jackie , but FloJo <p> " " I walk through an airport and people start yelling ' Jackie ! <p> Jackie ! ' " she said good-naturedly of those who mistake her for Jackie Joyner-Kersee , her sister-in-law and the Olympic heptathlon gold medalist . " " Before I can explain who I am , Al jumps in and says : ' No , no . This is FloJo , the fastest woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see my face ? Jackie looks like me . ' " <p> Recalling those moments , Griffith Joyner allowed herself a rare smile during a two-hour conversation punctuated with awkward pauses as she struggled to find the right words to describe a life in which she fought against the odds to make it out of what she called " " the ghetto . " Her parents divorced when she was 6 . Even now , she became teary-eyed as she remembered her mother staring into space , crying softly to herself . <p> " " I 'd asked her what was wrong , " said the daughter whose desire to honor her mother , also named Florence , inspired her to beat the odds , on and off the field . " " She 'd just shake her head and say : ' This is n't a home . I want to put you all in a real home . ' " <p> Again , Griffith Joyner was barely able to fight back tears as she talked about wanting to help children take a psychological break from their depressed surroundings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do on the President 's Council , " she said . " " Make sports and athletics available to every youth in America , not just one day a week like it was for me , but every day . " She credits the Sugar Ray Robinson Foundation with giving her and other children in Watts a chance to swim , run and jump in grassy playgrounds where " " swings were n't broken and you did n't get ringworm from playing in the sandbox . " Griffith Joyner will share her council post with Tom McMillen , a former professional basketball player , member of the 1972 U.S.Olympic basketball team and former six-term Democratic representative from Maryland . The council consists of 20 people appointed to a four-year term by the president , including a nonsalaried chairman . The members advise the president on ways to promote fitness and sports programs for all Americans . Griffith Joyner said she plans to leave most of the politicking to McMillen . <p> Reach beyond dreams <p> " " I 'll work the crowd , " she said . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . I always encourage kids to reach beyond their dreams . Do n't try to be like me . Be better than me . " <p> Did she hesitate about taking on a job where her predecessor was none other than the terminator himself , Arnold Schwarzenegger ? <p> " " No , I was ready to hop on the next flight out to Washington , " said Griffith Joyner , who lives in Mission Viejo , Calif. , and whose muscle definition could make even Schwarzenegger sit up and take notice . <p> Although the Joyners took part last year with Schwarzenegger in the council 's Great American Workout , an exercise and sports exhibition held on the White House lawn , Griffith Joyner said she was never " " quite clear " about what is actually done by the President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports . <p> " " That 's one thing Tom and I would like to change , " Griffith Joyner said . " " We want to get the word out about the council and what it does . We plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We want them to help us educate children about eating healthy , exercise and the importance of fun in sports , downplaying all this competitive stuff . " <p> These days , Griffith Joyner seems far removed from competition and the time when training for the Olympics was her life . On the track , she was so singularly focused , she said , she sometimes did n't recognize her own coach - and he was her husband . <p> There are different priorities in her life now . She and her husband have a 2-year-old daughter , Mary Ruth . " " She ca n't so much as see a bottle of nail polish without wanting to do her nails , " Griffith Joyner said . <p> Griffith Joyner has not completely disappeared , though , from public view . She had a bit role on the former television soap opera " " Santa Barbara " and has written 30 children 's books , which she hopes to have published . She designed sportswear lines for two Japanese companies , Mizuno and Sosakuia . In fall ' 94 , Starter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conn. , will offer a new line of her designs . She recently signed a $ 1 million contract for a fitness video and is working with inner-city youths through her new foundation , Flo-Jo International . <p> Her husband is anchor <p> While she credits her father , Robert Griffith , with giving her strength and determination , her mother with giving her a sense of caring for others and her brothers for her competitive spirit , it is her husband , she said , who is the anchor in her life . <p> When describing how they met , she sounded like a teen-ager in the throes of her first crush . " " It was at the 1980 Olympic trials in Eugene , Oregon , " she said , blushing as Al Joyner said , " " She did n't even know I existed . " <p> " " But it was n't until 1986 when he moved to California , " she said , " " that we started dating . We were married a year later . <p> He 's always been cordial . A perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a man . That 's what I fell in love with - his personality , his caring . . . his looks . " Then she laughed while he blushed . <p> Only her husband , she said , can make her ruin a perfect dietary regimen by " " throwing down some of his barbecue. "
