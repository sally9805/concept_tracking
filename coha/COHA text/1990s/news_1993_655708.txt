<p> IN the year since the Soviet Union 's disintegration , Russia has pursued a largely Western-oriented foreign policy , and the West has grown comfortable with its new friend . <p> President Boris Yeltsin has looked westward for vital economic aid and political support for his controversial reforms . He has carried on and extended the arms control policies of the previous Soviet government of Mikhail Gorbachev . Russia has backed Western policy in the Persian Gulf , Cuba , and elsewhere , shedding the ideological alliances of the Soviet communist era . <p> But as Russians recover from the shock of the Soviet Union 's collapse , a movement is growing here , one backed even by those in power , that could make Russia a less-sure friend of the West . Russia 's foreign and security policies have become rallying points in the parliament for a growing coalition of former Communists and new nationalists who deplore the pro-Western policies . <p> Not only extremists but also many moderates criticize policies ranging from the position on the Balkan crisis to a new nuclear disarmament pact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its great-power status , is being taken for granted . <p> Since last fall , President Yeltsin has shown an increasing receptivity to critics of that pro-Western policy . In an Oct. 27 speech to senior officials of the Foreign Ministry , he assailed the failure to define a foreign policy that reflects Russia 's status as a great power . He chided the Foreign Ministry for its obsequious attitude toward the West . <p> " We are too shy in the world community , " Mr. Yeltsin said . " We often take defensive positions or , on the contrary , copy others . They sometimes address Russia in an inadmissible way , even put humiliating conditions . But Russia is not a country that can be kept in the entrance hall . " <p> These assertions were followed by a series of presidential visits to Russia 's Asian neighbors , beginning with South Korea . In recent weeks the Russian government has carefully distanced itself from the US decision to use force against Iraq and to contemplate using it against Serbia . Yeltsin was pointedly defiant , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusing US demands to scrap a contract to sell rocket engines to the Indian space program . During that visit , Yeltsin went the furthest he has gone so far in defining this shift in Russian foreign policy . <p> " Russia is a Euro-Asian power whose territory covers an area of 17 million square kilometers , including 10 million square kilometers lying in Asia , " he said at a press conference Jan. 29 . <p> " This simple arithmetic determines that we need to maintain a balance in our foreign policy relations with the West and the East . Our emblem has a two-headed eagle , one head looking to the West and the other head looking to the East . <p> " We had an independent foreign policy a year ago by making an emphasis on our relations with the United States . That was because we had to provide a powerful incentive to the drive for reduction of nuclear weapons to combat fear and then to proceed along the path of balance . <p> " The recent series of state visits to South Korea , China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are moving away from the Western emphasis . " Liberals also ' Eurasians ' <p> Yeltsin counts among his advisers some respected liberals who are also strong advocates of this " Eurasian " viewpoint , as it has been popularly labeled . These include presidential counselor and historian Sergei Stankeivich and Asian specialist Vladimir Lukin , who currently serves as ambassador to the US . As moderate nationalists , these liberal democrats assert that the pro-Western policy has failed to yield results , particularly in terms of promised Western aid . <p> " Yeltsin 's balancing act is more pragmatic than conceptual , " former Soviet Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh says . " Yeltsin 's actions in Asia are not a sign that he does n't trust the West ... But the West practically is not doing much . Yeltsin is running around looking for more friends , more support , just to sustain the reform . " <p> The veteran diplomat points to the failure of Westernizing liberals , dubbed the " Atlanticists , " to define a comprehensive Russian foreign policy in the post-Soviet era . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about defining what Russia is at the moment , " he says . " Even the exact geographic contours of the country are not discussed . " For example , the Foreign Ministry , unused to the idea that what was once a fellow Soviet republic is now a foreign country , has been slow to focus on relations with Ukraine . <p> But the Atlanticists ' opponents have little trouble defining their vision of Russia . They reach back to a broad set of ideas of imperial nationalism , developed during the 19th and early 20th centuries . Among the popular ideas widely discussed in radical nationalist journals and newspapers is Eurasianism , developed by Russian emigre intellectuals in the 1920s and 30s partly in response to the creation of the Soviet Union . <p> Eurasianism draws heavily on the thoughts of Petr Savitsky , a geographer who in 1921 defined a concept of Eurasian geopolitics , asserting Russia represents a unique civilization . These views were summarized and promoted in a Dec. 24 article in Pravda by former Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov : " The Eurasians are those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whom Russia is not just a state but one-sixth of the earth , neither Europe nor Asia , but a special heartland continent - Eurasia - with its own cultural and historical destiny . " <p> Mr. Zyuganov is one of the leaders of the National Salvation Front , the newest and most powerful manifestation of the political alliance of former Communist and Russian chauvinists . He advocates that Russia must now choose between a " Western world view " of extreme individualism and Russia 's corporatist , collectivist tradition . While the West " regards the state as a ' night watchman ' with rather limited functions , " he wrote , Eurasia sees the state as a sacred institution , " a father , not a ' sales manager . ' " <p> Sergei Baburin , a young politician considered the leading figure in the nationalist bloc in parliament , expressed this view in a lengthy address to journalists Jan. 28 . To the extent that Russia looks outside for models of reform , Mr. Baburin says it should base itself on the more statist , hierarchical examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and China . <p> For Baburin , as well as for many other Eurasianists , the most vital issue is the fate of the former Soviet Union , which they see as largely synonymous with Russia . They regard the separation of the Baltics , Ukraine , Belarus , Kazakhstan , and the Transcaucasian republics from Russia as a violation of historical logic . <p> " Our experience of a single , united Russian state is not decades old , " Baburin says , referring to the Soviet period , " it is centuries old . Therefore , whoever is ... to be leader of Russia will have to face the challenge of stopping and reversing the centrifugal forces now working in Russia . " <p> Eurasianists have also tried to define their own security policy . In the nationalist journal Nash Sovremennik of December , Gen. Boris Tarasov outlined a " military strategy " for Russia . " Russia faces long-term threats from a revived Germany and Japan , " he wrote , adding that the greatest danger arises from former republics . <p> " The most important task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or re-establishment of Russia within her historical boundaries , at least within the borders of its Slavic nucleus , " he argued . " Otherwise Ukraine will probably become a major source of instability ... Its thrust toward a great-power-type policy and its association with other countries in order to confront Russia will be very strong . " <p> Wary of becoming embroiled in ethnic and religious conflicts in Muslim Central Asia and the Transcaucasus , General Tarasov advocates an " allied countries ' belt " including Kazakhstan , which has a 40 percent Russian population , and Communist-lead Uzbekistan . A growing potency <p> These advocates of Eurasianism are undoubtedly among the most strident and extreme of the nationalist camp . But Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev , a major target of these forces , acknowledged the growing potency of these ideas in an unusual speech at a mid-December meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe . He delivered what he later explained was a mock summary of " the demands of what is by no means the most extreme opposition in Russia . " <p> The speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift in Russian focus from Europe to Asia , demanded the lifting of sanctions on Serbia , and announced the re-establishment of a federation among the former Soviet states . <p> While Mr. Kozyrev was widely criticized for his unorthodox style , his invented warning rings true . Indeed , in a speech to parliament 's foreign affairs commission Jan. 26 , Kozyrev outlined a policy that was noticeably inward-looking . <p> Yeltsin is now going to cut back his travel , and Russia 's top priority will be to strengthen the Commonwealth of Independent States , the loose confederation of 10 former Soviet republics , Kozyrev told parliament , according to an official Itar-Tass report . Other priorities , he said , are defending the human rights of Russians living in former republics and creating a " belt of good neighbors " around Russia . <p> While he defended recent arms control treaties as beneficial for Russian security , Kozyrev added that " disarmament is not a goal in itself .
