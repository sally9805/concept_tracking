A man , standing high above a toliet peeing , stares in the wall-to-wall bathroom mirror of his new , upscale apartment . The image in the mirror is over six feet tall , not quite thirty , athletic and energethic , well-educated , well-paid , single , and proud . The man smiles at the image fiantly and says , " You 're okay . " The image points at the man and replies , " No , brother , you 're okay . " <p> It 's noon Sunday and I have slummed away whole sheets of morning on my twentieth-floor terrace , trying to make sense of what happened me yesterday . . . or , depending on how you look at it , what did not happen . My maiden jaunt through my new community , Bay View , was either a carpeted introduction or a stinging slap in the face . I ca n't decide which , and it matters dearly . It 's the difference between inclusion and exclusion , night and day , stop and go , sanity and schizophrenia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top flap in the breeze . Dark shades and a tinted acrylic terrace wall shield my eyes from the sun . Arms crossed , legs crossed , I sway in a giving chaise lounge in meter with the elegant ripples of glossy blue waves that comb the bay , oblivious to the din of the pedestrians way down below . Occasionally I pat my sandaled feet on the carpeted terrace floor to the straight-ahead , post-bop jazz streaming from a carousel of compact disks trough stereophonic speakers in the living room . <p> I peer at the bay and the thought comes and goes that Bay View needs a lot more trees , shrubbery , and wildly growing things . Unfortunately , the idea is twisted with hypocrisy . My old Queens neighborhood had hardly any public plant life to speak of  --  a tree here , another there , reeds of grass squeezing through cracks in the sidewalk slabs that dominated the streets . On the other hand , Bay View is generously pepped with all sorts of flora  --  conifers , bloated shrubbery , ivy galore . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I exclaimed to my girlfriend Fifi , " Why so many trees ? " But now that I have been secularly baptized in my new surroundings , I no longer feel this community has enough plant life . I would prefer that Bay View be thatched densely enough to quench my newfound thirst for privacy . Toward that end , I have contemplated foresting my terrace . <p> However , I must be considerate of my shapely , tangerine-breasted next-door neighbor Susan Bayer . The verdant blotting of the translucent acrylic partition separating our contiguous terraces might be taken as a vile reenactment of Jim Crow cowardly hiding behind nature 's dress . My built-in historical baggage would not allow me to brook the devilish fellow , so how could I expect my neighbor to accept him ? But , who knows , perhaps she would applaud whatever initiative I took to buttress our division . <p> I suspect Dr. Bayer will come out , as usual , at six on the dot , to bask , too , but separately , in an ebbing sun  --  her own shrubs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sunshades resting securely on the huge braid of hair running laterally across the top of her head . I would not be surprised if she did not say " Hello " today . Though not unpopular in this swirling city , the naked proximity of our contrasting skin complexions fosters uneasiness . <p> On the ground , the earth level , it is safe to say " Hi , " smile broadly , and chat , but briefly . But height creates social distance , no matter how near the chocolate and cream-colored fingers . The higher the floor , the greater the uneasiness . Black and white . Beige and more beige . The wall dividing our terraces symbolizes the madness . I have lived here now for two weeks . The first time we met , we looked , smiled , exchanged identification , backed away from the wall , and thereafter each of us has assumed the other does not exist . <p> Perhaps her glass door will slide open a bit before or after six . If it does , I will ask if she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invite her over for baked chicken . If , as usual she comes out at six sharp , I will assume the pattern sticks and cordially disregard her . <p> The weekend had begun with a bang . Friday afternoon , backed by a team of super management analysts , I gift-wrapped the findings of an exhaustive yearlong management study and proffered recommendations that , if implemented , promised resuscitation of the client 's shaky bottom line . After a debriefing session back at our midtown Manhattan office , my associates and I celebrated at a nearby watering hole with salty pretzels and the happy-hour libations needed to wash them down . A couple of beers into the celebration , I rose from the bar stool and bid everyone goodnight and a rejuvenating weekend . Draping my wool-lined London Fog over one arm and carrying my briefcase in the other , I exited the bar and stepped toward the subway station . For the first time in weeks , work would not follow me home . My briefcase was empty ; my head was light . Roseate over the success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , I shunned the train and hailed a taxi with the haughty confidence of a person who Lived in a New York community where cabbies are well tipped and never mugged . <p> " Where to ? " <p> " Bay View , please . " <p> Early Saturday , I had hopped out of bed filled with playful energy . Rapt by the bay 's beauty and mild temperament , I showered , put on my most colorful jogging suit and sneakers , opened the refrigerator , and gulped down several ounces of orange juice from the half-gallon carton , then walked bouncily to the elevator whistling . Downstairs , I asked the pompously uniformed doorman for the shortest route to the jogging path that rimmed the bay . His directions and animated gestures seemed unnecessarily flowery for a day meant for relaxation . As I walked leisurely in the appointed direction , an entrance to the path revealed itself . It was the that I lifted my legs and began my first excursion along the bay . <p> After gobbling up a few miles of breathtaking scenery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mainland . Catching my breath and wiping at the sweat on my face , I stopped at a nearby supermarket to grab a six-pack of Diet Coke . When I stepped on the entrance mat and the automatic door buzzed open , a cooled warm breeze ran liquid peppermint through my pores . Preparing myself for the soda search , I could not help but notice a little guy tiptoeing , extending his arm and body , reaching intently into his mom 's shopping cart for something he yearned for or was curious about . He was a cherubic little fellow , auburn curly hair , donning a spiffy green jump suit . <p> " Harold ! Get down from there ! " his mother commanded . <p> The little guy just kept tiptoeing and reaching . <p> " How are ya , little fella ? " I tried . <p> Harold craned his neck , the metal spokes of the shopping cart blurring as his eyes caught on to me . <p> He looked at once puzzled and amazed . <p> I smiled and peered up the aisle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold cried out , " Look , Mom , a chocolate man ! " <p> Heads turned . Harold 's mom , in her excitement , accidentally dismantled an elaborate saltine cracker display , turning toward her son as if the world were crumbling merely to say , " Shhhhhh . " I felt embarrassed because Harold 's mom seemed embarrassed . She never did face my way . Instead , she busied herself juggling must be the African , Native American , and European mingling in my skin , reddened by the sun , and glossed over by sweat dripping from my brow . My jogging along the bay at a moderately brisk pace had not given my new neighbors much of a gander at me . But now that I had paused in the market , I could be ogled more easily . <p> Little Harold kept right on looking at me , puzzled and amazed , still standing on his toes , his hands still clasping top rim of the shopping cart . <p> The other shoppers suavely ignored the complication by looking away without really looking away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered what in the world a chocolate man was . I wondered , too , and wished I had a mirror to see myself . <p> Quite frankly , I appreciated the way little Harold had looked at me . The was a twinkle in his eyes . As I moved through the store , I even wondered I should be amused . If I was the least bit disturbed , it was with everyone except Harold . Presumably their nonchalance represented a sort of tacit apology . But an apology seemed out of order . A broad smile would have been fitting . <p> After all , little Harold had not called me a spook . He had called me a " chocolate man . " Was not his reference Hershey 's or Nestle 's milk chocolate ? The more I thought about it , the better I felt . Yet I could not convey my mild elation to any of those who thought it fitting to sequester themselves from what they consensually perceived to be a racial indelicacy . They would not have understood , because , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I just winked at little Harold . I wanted him to know that everything was just fine . <p> Back at the luxury high-rise , my new home , a six pack of soda tucked under my arm , I awaited an elevator with a neighbor . <p> " These elevators are dreadfully slow , " he complained . <p> " Yep . " <p> " Live here long ? " he asked . <p> " No , just a couple of weeks . " <p> " How do you like it so far ? " <p> " Fine . " <p> " Although you must admit the rent is somewhat on the high side , " he probed . <p> " Au contraire , " I lied . " I personally ca n't believe the rent is so low . " <p> " Oh " He paused momentarily . <p> " Are you the footballer ? " <p> " The footballer ? " <p> " Yeah , there 's a guy here who plays professional football for the New York Jets . " <p> " Is that right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a professional football player . I guess there is more than one of us here . " <p> " One of what ? " <p> " You know . " <p> " Oh . " <p> Later Saturday afternoon , I invited Fifi over for lunch . As usual she had a lot to say . <p> " Baby , this twentieth-floor terrace is heaven . . . a romantic vista . A bird 's nest ! Look at the tanned bodies sprawled along the luxurious swimming pool ; the hexagonal refreshment stand . . . mai tai , ummmm . . . . The water and the boats that dot the bay  --  big ones , small ones  --  look at them . Oh , baby , it 's wonderful here . " <p> Fifi keeps telling me how crazy she is about this place . While that pleases me , it does n't affect my countenance , because my moving to the Bay View Luxury Apartments was her idea , not mine . <p> " Now are n't you glad you left all that squalor behind ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and say that ? I had succeeded , as I often do , in screwing up the mood . Fifi clasped her disarming denim-hugged hips , and her mouth shifted into overdrive . <p> " Do n't play dumb . That creepy Queens neighborhood you lived in was the pits . " <p> " It 's not the pits , Fifi . Real people live there . So how can it be the pits ? " <p> " It 's the pits because it stunk . " <p> " It stunk ? " <p> " The garbage , the crime , the noise , the traffic  --  you name it , it stunk . " <p> For the two weeks I 've been here , and sometime before , I have argued with Fifi about this matter . Really , I am not very determined to win these arguments and she knows it . As soon as she starts throwing her miniature temper tantrums , I give in . <p> You see , the move from " squalor " to " luxury " has stirred my conscience . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city councilman used to say back in Los Angeles , " Do n't move ! Improve ! " But , according to Fifi , the old neighborhood was a real downer , absolutely no hope . I did n't budge , so she threatened me . <p> " Move or else . . . ! " <p> The threat came while I was in a particularly vulnerable position , so I pecked Fifi on the neck and swore I would look for a better place immediately . Of course , she had already searched for and found the new land , Bay View . Before I knew what hit me , I was here . <p> When this time I complained about the high rent , Fifi discarded my concern with a hand wave that just as well could have been used to swat a fly . " That 's not your problem , ba-by . . . maybe someone else 's . So do n't worry about it . You 're a management consultant with unlimited potential . Besides you did n't kill yourself getting all those college degrees for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What about my friends I argued . " Do I callously forsake them ? " <p> The question had the impact of a vacuous thud . My friends are my friends no matter where I live , are n't they ? Truthfully , I loved my old Los Angeles and Queens neighborhoods . They were more like home than this place by the bay . In them , I had not felt like a minority . Fifi peeped the emptiness in my argument and lit into me . <p> " Forsake them ? If they had the chance , they 'd do the same thing you did , and invite you over for cocktails . I do n't see why you do n't just let go of that inner-city cultural bullshit . You know good and well you ado this place , you fraud . That 's what 's wrong with you high-yellow Negroes ; you never know whether you 're going or coming . " <p> " Fifi ! " <p> I had prepared an absolutely scrumptious baked chicken  --  marinated twenty-four hours in all sorts of wonderful herbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much , the chicken got cold . My appetite froze , so I did n't slice it . We did n't eat and she left . What the hell . <p> Fifi having gone in a huff , I felt edgy and courageous enough to give tennis another whack . On the first court , the tennis pro enthusiastically measured out a lesson to a middle-aged woman who behaved as if she had read books on tennis etiquette . Of the remaining four courts , only one was occupied  --  a short , stocky , blond-haired gentleman was practicing his service . In my eagerness to play , I asked him if he 'd like to " hit a few . " <p> " Of course , " he replied . <p> Thirty minutes into our game , a zinging tennis ball deflected off my racket onto the core of my eye socket . I wanted to call it a night . But my ad hoc partner , Huntz , insisted I give my eye a rest ; in maybe ten minutes the blurred vision and the headache would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an umbrella-enfolded patio table , I nursed my eye while Huntz spouted verbal palliatives . During our chitchat , Huntz recounted his recent six-day vacation to Puerto Rico . On his first day he had dozed off on the beach for four hours and awakened with what he thought were third-degree sunburns . <p> " Gee , I would have died under those circumstances , " I suggested vicariously . <p> " No , probably not , " he conjectured . " I understand that your people have an extra layer of skin that protects you from the sun 's rays . " <p> Without a clear thought , all I could think to say was , " Oh . " Then I asked him how he happened upon that knowledge . <p> " It is true , " he persisted . " That is why you a not as affected by the heat as I am . " <p> I suggested to Huntz that the reason the sun tolerated my skin more than his had nothing to do with the respective thickness of the two . <p> " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huntz insisted . <p> Quite frankly , I had no idea whether Huntz was right or wrong . I had never heard anything like it . But having become a chocolate man , a professional football player , and a high-yellow Negro in the space of a day , I was a tad suspicious and scrappy . Picking at his logic , I suggested that , since albinos are doubly sensitive to the sun 's rays , their skin must be thinnest . <p> " Hmm , I had not thought of that , " Huntz said , nudging his upper lip with an index finger . <p> Adding another layer to this " layer " question , I noted that some albinos a black and , therefore , some blacks have thinner skins than whites . <p> " Hmmmm , " he muttered . <p> And I " hummed , " too . <p> " Then what is the reason . . . ? " <p> Before Huntz could complete his question , I had blurted out the word pigmentation . I pointed out that he and I had different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the greater one 's resistance to the sun 's rays . <p> " But I 'm white . I have no pigmentation , no melanin . " <p> " Albinos are white ; you do have color . " <p> " Really ? " he laughed . <p> " Frankly , we 're very nearly the same complexion . " <p> He laughed again . I laughed , too . <p> " So what might my complexion be ? " he ventured . <p> " Brown , tan , beige . Take your pick . " <p> " Well , now , what 's yours ? " he asked . <p> I was stumped . It did n't seem appropriate to say brown , tan , or beige . So I told him that my color was chocolate . <p> " Chocolate ? " he mused . <p> " Sure , why not ? " <p> " Okay , " he laughed . " That 's a nice color . Your eye looks better now . Come Let us hit more balls before the night says ' No . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow zombied my way into Sunday . As Bay View spins away from the sun , my sense of self still eludes me . However , I take solace in having the means to deal with my dilemma up high in private . For the higher one lives , the fewer people there are . <p> Indeed , the true value of lofty abodes lies not in their provision of panoramic vistas of this stupendous city , or in getting one nearer to heaven . Rather , they enable those of us who can afford them to get away from it all  --  the maddening crowd , the heavy air of excessive personalities  --  perhaps a necessity if you perceive acutely that you are just one among an uncountable number of unknowable people , all literally within eyeshot . Here , if one cared to , the trappings of culture and etiquette could be dropped . Basic courtesies and facades could be eructed from the soul . Up high , there is simply no need to hold heavy gas in the bowels , massage a martini , and simultaneously chat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You see , gas rises toward the stratosphere , toward heaven ; cultural facades fall downward at the same speed as bricks ( according to Newton ) . <p> So I 'm up here airing out , feeling lofty but unsettled about who I am , and occasionally reflecting on the tension that grips the translucent dividing wall . Yet the wall could not have been meant for me , or against me , but rather for separateness ' sake . Up high , it is not common to see a chocolate man basking in the sun . . . alone . Under these conditions , a beige young woman could not be protected by the earthly ethos of artificial cordiality . I was for some days a stranger ; then she got the make on me ( purely for security reasons ) . Now , to her , I 'm a model neighbor ( quiet and nonexistent . <p> I think perhaps I 'll break the pattern tonight . . . even if she comes out at six sharp . After all , how could she not like chocolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knows Huntz . I hope she does n't know Fifi . I would prefer that she knew little Harold , for chocolate is a lot brighter than high-yellow . <p> Randy Ross writes from Huntington Park , California .
