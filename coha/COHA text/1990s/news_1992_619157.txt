<p> Steve Embry 's eyes glistened with tears as he held his 3-year-old daughter in his arms and recalled how he and his wife lost the home they " scrimped and saved " to buy . <p> Two months after Meagan was born , with his wife still on maternity leave , Embry was laid off as a computer graphics designer . He sent out countless resumes but could not find a job , for any salary , even after a year . <p> Behind on their mortgage , the couple sold everything they owned to make their house payment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , which had taken over their bank . The FDIC took their money but foreclosed anyway , because the Embrys could not come up with an additional $ 7,000 to pay for the auctioneer who was hired when foreclosure proceedings began . <p> " It 's one of the most painful and difficult things that has happened in my life , " Embry said , standing in front of his old house . " When it 's just me , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a tragedy . But this is happening to thousands of people up here . " <p> Embry 's anguish and anger echo throughout New Hampshire , where boom went bust as quickly as George Bush changed his mind on no new taxes  --  and where despair has replaced hope , as recession continues to dampen the chances of recovery . <p> As New Hampshire voters go to the polls today in the first primary of the 1992 presidential season , they do so against the grim backdrop of recession : <p> * Unemployment in New Hampshire has soared from 2.2 percent in 1988 to 7.8 percent at the end of 1991 . The national unemployment figure at the end of 1991 was 6.8 percent . <p> * About 50,000 jobs have been lost in the last two years , including many high-paying , white-collar positions and nearly 10 percent of total nonfarm employment . <p> * Bankruptcies in the state have soared from 835 cases in 1988 to 3,848 in 1991 . Of those 1991 bankruptcies , 570 were businesses and 3,278 were personal . <p> * Home foreclosures accounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last year , the FDIC seized five of the largest banks in New Hampshire . Among them , they had $ 4.7 billion in assets , or about one-fourth of the banking assets in New Hampshire . <p> * Food stamp use increased 39 percent from 1990 to 1991 , giving New Hampshire the dubious honor of being second in the nation in that economic category . <p> " What we have in New Hampshire , " said Republican presidential challenger Pat Buchanan , whose campaign has been fueled by anger about the economy , " can be summed up in a single word  --  depression . Depression in economic terms , depression in human terms . This is the real world up here . " <p> Driven by cuts in defense spending , a slump in the computer industry and too many bad bank loans , the deterioration of New Hampshire 's economy has been virtually complete . High-tech , manufacturing and tourism have taken the biggest hits , with real estate and retail not far behind . <p> In California , where the real estate market has sagged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state has begun to feel twinges of the loss of the basic economic underpinning that has shaken New Hampshire . There are key differences between the two states , however  --  in the time span of their troubles , the diversity of their economies and their perceived abilities to recover . <p> In New Hampshire , people cry when they talk about how they have struggled for the past few years , and they cry when they describe their problems at presidential candidates ' forums . <p> " I thought , " said Steve Embry , " I was pretty secure . " <p> SIGNS OF RECESSION <p> From Derry to Dixon Notch , from Claremont to Keene , from Nashua to the North Country , the signs of recession are everywhere . <p> It can be seen in the foreclosure sale signs that dot Highway 101 between Nashua and Keene , in the long lines at the unemployment office in Manchester or in the face of a woman with a master 's degree waiting tables at a restaurant in Nashua . <p> In Plymouth , a town of 5,200 just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Moose Crossing " and " Frost Heaves , " the recession wears many faces . <p> Meg McGlauflin has lived through the boom , which was driven by the high-tech and real estate development explosion of the early 1980s , and the bust , which was signaled by the collapse of the real estate market and the federal seizure of state banks . <p> " It 's a nice place to be and a nice place to bring your kids up , " she said over a cup of coffee in her kitchen , which has a splendid view of the snow-covered Tenne Mountain . " But it has its ups and downs . " <p> Until 1987 , she said , " the banks were throwing money at people . " <p> As her husband , Tom , put it , " Everybody was cranking out as much as they could . Lots of people bought two new cars , put additions on their houses and traded up to new homes . Anybody with a hammer could call himself a carpenter and find a job . " <p> Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely saturated , " Mrs. McGlauflin said , " the tourists stopped coming , the most popular restaurant in town was forced to close , " as did the ski shop where she had worked for years . <p> Merilise O'Connor , Plymouth 's town administrator , said the hard economic times are reflected in the sharply rising costs of local welfare , which is used to help the needy until they get back on their feet or on Aid to Families with Dependent Children , which is administered by the state . <p> In the 1987-88 fiscal year , the town spent $ 900 on local welfare needs . In the current year , with more than four months to go , it has already spent $ 74,000 . <p> " Four years ago , there was a feeling of euphoria , " O'Connor said . " Now , people getting paid every week are feeling guilty . <p> " The folks who are working are quietly counting their blessings , and the folks who are n't are feeling very angry and hopeless , " she added . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I work hard , things will be all right . ' Now , they do n't see any way out . " <p> The most visible sign of the recession is a covered bridge that has been closed for months because there is not enough money in the treasury to make it safe . <p> People living on the other side of the Baker River have to drive miles out of their way to get to town , so some residents have formed a fund-raising committee and are trying to get the bridge adopted by the Covered Bridge Society . No one believes it will reopen soon . <p> SKIMPING ON MEDICINE <p> Dr. Fred Kelsey , who works in the local hospital , sees another symptom of the recession in the people with little or no health insurance who cut back on medical care to make ends meet . <p> " They just ca n't afford to eat , pay their taxes and buy their medicine , so they wo n't buy their medicine , " he said . " People come in less often , or wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Kelsey 's wife , Kathy , is active in community school affairs . She described the pain of watching what is happening in her town . <p> " Our friends are having their houses repossessed , " she said , sipping a cup of tea in her living room . " When you see a family that you know having their home auctioned off , what do you say ? It 's almost like you 're grieving . " <p> HOW IT HAPPENED <p> A recent Boston Herald poll found that 75 percent of New Hampshire residents said they expect the next generation to be worse off economically than their own . And 54 percent of those polled said they are worse off now than they were four years ago . <p> At that time , the recession had just begun in New Hampshire . <p> The defense buildup of the Reagan era fueled the growth of the high-tech industry and made New Hampshire a fast-track real estate market in the early and mid-1980s . But when defense spending slowed and the economy weakened , the bubble burst , crippling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate market faltered , heavy layoffs began in high- tech companies , computer firms and defense industries . After people began losing their jobs , they also began losing their homes . <p> Although the homeless and panhandlers do not populate the streets of New Hampshire cities in anywhere near the numbers they do in San Francisco and Los Angeles , there are a few . And they are very cold , as they sit bundled up in doorways when temperatures are well below freezing . <p> Indoors , where political ads drone nonstop on television , there is also a video clip that plays over and over in news stories about the New Hampshire economy . <p> Senator Tom Harkin was campaigning when a wide-eyed 5-year- old boy in a blue snowsuit walked up and stuck out his hand . <p> In three sentences , the boy summed up what the recession and today 's primary mean here . <p> " Do you have a job ? " he said to Harkin , who admitted that he did . <p> " My mom and dad do n't have a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . "
