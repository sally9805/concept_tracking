For all those women who wailed " How could she do it ? " when Gloria Steinem , the world 's most famous feminist , began keeping company with demibillionaire real estate developer and aspiring journalist Mort Zuckerman in the late ' 80s , Revolution from Within : A Book of Self-Esteem ( Little , Brown ; 377 pages ; $22.95 ) will serve as belated explanation . She did it for the car . <P> This was n't just any car she fell for but a warm , chauffeur-driven cocoon of transit dispatched by Zuckerman to meet her as she returned to La Guardia Airport late one night from yet another fund-raising trip , so exhausted that the auto 's " sheltering presence loomed out of all proportion . " There she was , approaching 50 , a burned-out crusader for women 's causes who had not had time in 20 years to unpack the boxes in her bare apartment . She was nearly eligible for a senior citizen 's discount before she bought her first sofa . Despite her confident demeanor , she felt so plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on television was . Thin as a pinstripe , she nonetheless felt one Sara Lee cheesecake away from Weight Watchers . Once a lively writer who impersonated a Playboy Bunny to expose Hugh Hefner 's cheesy idea of sex appeal and quipped that if men could menstruate they would brag about how long and how much , she had produced very little since her collection of essays , Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions , in 1983 . Ms. , the magazine she co-founded in 1972 and edited from crisis to crisis ever since , was spinning out of her control . <P> What was worse , the younger generation winced at the word feminism , while those who had never supported the idea were blaming it for everything from male impotence to global warming . By the time she sank into the soft leather interior of the car that night at La Guardia , she was insecure as a junk bond , without energy , without hope and without enough self-esteem to resist this inappropriate but eager suitor .

" She traces her loss of self to the day her 300-lb. father , an itinerant salesman , abandoned her when she was 10 in a rat-infested , dilapidated farmhouse fronting on a major highway in Toledo . Left to care for a loving but mentally ill mother who heard voices , she was forced to grow up too soon , to be mother to her mother . She escaped to Smith College but never escaped the trap of being the caretaker . Once she became involved in the movement , there was no campus , community group or benefit so small that she would n't hop on a plane and raise money for it . At times it seemed as if she had taken personal responsibility for every oppressed woman in America . <P> It is not surprising that this loss of childhood would catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come along in the guise of a knight in shining sedan , " someone , " she writes , " I could n't take care of . " Overscheduled women everywhere will recognize themselves in her surrender to a decision-free zone of well-appointed houses and someone to clean them .
