<p> Around the cattle ranches and town squares of Tehama County , Leo Urbanski is hailed by many as a kind of Johnny Appleseed , a savior who would nourish the region 's parched economy with millions of tourist dollars . <p> His ambitious plan , which has gained widespread attention , is to build a $ 3 billion theme park near Red Bluff for country music buffs , just like the venture that has turned the small Ozarks town of Branson , Mo. , into a major attraction . <p> There is little question that Urbanski , a 54-year-old Pennsylvanian with a never-say- die attitude , has the chutzpah to bring it off . But whether he can raise the fortune needed for the project is quite another matter . <p> And then there is Urbanski himself , a dreamer whose visions have included a giant water pump for irrigating the desert , shrimp farming , motivational seminars and a device to reclaim waste oil . Few of his ideas have gone anywhere , and two have landed him in civil court for alleged fraud . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the past 20 years he has had a run-in with the law , left a trail of business flops and had ties to at least two people who were associated with the notorious Holiday Magic pyramid sales empire in Marin County two decades ago . <p> Despite that checkered background , Urbanski 's chief benefactor in the Tehama County project , Nashville music impresario Buddy Killen , stands by his man . <p> " Leo is trustworthy , " Killen said . " I have n't found that he has lied to me in any way . Besides , behind every successful man , there are normally some failures . " <p> In Urbanski , the boosters of the so-called Celebrity City project are relying on a latter-day gold prospector who has wandered the country , from Las Vegas to Anaheim to Ohio , in search of the big score , often leaving behind only debts or fizzled ambitions . <p> Urbanski has had some successes , but they never seem to last . He got so wealthy drilling wells during the 1970s oil crisis that he and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rolls-Royce . But that venture ended in bankruptcy . <p> Yet he has persisted , and now his dreams are focused on Tehama County . <p> Urbanski has persuaded Killen and some two dozen anonymous investors to bankroll the venture , which would transform 1,600 acres of rolling ranchland off Interstate 5 into a music mecca whose enormity would eclipse every major theme park in America . Just the size of it  --  40 music theaters , 20,000 hotel and motel rooms  --  tells something about Urbanski 's ideas . <p> ' A BIG DREAMER ' <p> " Leo is a dreamer , and he 's a big dreamer , " said Frank Turgeon , an Ohio executive who worked with Urbanski three years ago . " You and I think in terms of millions . He thinks in terms of billions , tens of billions . " <p> To understand Urbanski 's driven nature , it helps to look at his roots in the gritty coal country of Pennsylvania in the 1950s . He grew up in McKeesport , a steel town of 50,000 some 15 miles south of Pittsburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his father later owned a machine shop . <p> " From an early age , Leo was just always interested in achieving , " Urbanski 's sister , Marie Keys , said . " He always seemed to have small jobs somewhere . He set pins at bowling alleys . He worked at the local grocery store . " <p> Urbanski graduated from McKeesport High School in 1958 , where he concentrated on " distributive education , " a euphemism for sales and marketing , and soon got a job selling clothes at a local haberdashery . In 1967 , his sister said , Urbanski made what she called the " Randomatic " computer , a house-shaped device with push buttons that allowed prospective homebuyers to find neighborhoods that they could afford . <p> Urbanski was on his way . <p> He got married , sold insurance for a time  --  he won an industry award for selling $ 2.5 million worth of life insurance in seven months  --  then got into the oil-drilling business in the 1970s in Columbus , Ohio , when the OPEC embargo struck . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did well for a time , financed by investment partnerships . <p> One drilling operation , Prudential Petroleum Inc. , raised at least $ 40 million by Nowe 's estimate . Hundreds of wells were sunk . Urbanski lived in a big house . The partners bought the Rolls-Royce that ultimately wound up in the hands of baseball star Pete Rose . <p> In the late 1970s , however , the venture crashed , although Nowe said he had left the business by that time . Some say the collapsing oil market caused the downfall ; others believe that the venture got overextended . Ultimately , a PPI successor , Opex , was liquidated in bankruptcy proceedings and many investors got only pennies on the dollar . <p> " We had a zillion dollars invested , and it did n't work , " Urbanski said . <p> REBOUND IN THE ' 80S <p> Urbanski , on the rebound in the 1980s , discovered multilevel marketing , a method of direct selling of goods and services to the public  --  some firms , for example , use it to sell makeup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ne'er-do- well cousin of multilevel marketing is called a pyramid scheme  --  an endless chain that has the newest investors paying the ones who were brought in before them and rarely getting anything in return . <p> In 1988 , the Ohio attorney general shut down Urbanski 's Entrepreneurial Development Co . ( Endec ) as a pyramid scam . Urbanski insisted he was selling motivational tapes , but authorities said the business was built on endless- chain sales recruitment . <p> Ohio law enforcement officials said at least two of Endec 's consultants had been heavily involved in the late ' 60s and early ' 70s in the Holiday Magic cosmetics empire , a worldwide operation ultimately closed in the face of attacks by numerous state and federal regulators . A federal judge later ordered restitution to Holiday Magic investors who said they had been cheated . <p> One paid Endec consultant , Sharoll Shumate , had been president of Leadership Dynamics Institute , a controversial motivational training offshoot of Holiday Magic . Also now defunct , the institute was the target of numerous lawsuits from trainees who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perform sex acts . <p> One of the trainees , a 15-year- old girl , collapsed and died on an institute survival hike in 1972 . The suits were settled out of court , in one case for $ 40,000 . <p> Another ex-Holiday Magic official who worked for Urbanski 's Endec was David Smile , according to Ohio Assistant Attorney General Thomas McGuire . In his days as a sales kingpin at Holiday Magic , Smile boasted of making as much as $ 25,000 a month and drove around in a Rolls-Royce with a gold-plated grille . <p> McGuire said Endec was " calling in all the pyramid sharks from across the country . " Although McGuire put Endec out of business , he says he did not really look at Urbanski as an archcriminal . <p> " He 's likable . He 's a nice guy , " McGuire said . " We had lunch after the consent judgment . He wanted to hear my side of the story , so we went to McDonald 's . And then he talked about things he was involved in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your chair , and when you put your feet down it demagnetizes you . Leo 's got this mix of New Age and entrepreneurial stuff . " <p> DESERT SCHEMES <p> Former associates say one of his schemes was to develop a " trash pump , " so named because it would pump anything out of the ground without getting clogged . Urbanski 's idea was to turn vast deserts into lush , civilized living and recreational areas by pumping water up through the desert sand . <p> To get electricity for this , Urbanski wanted to develop a generator that would pull electricity out of the air by intercepting electromagnetic waves that run from the North Pole to the South Pole . <p> Urbanski said he still has " most of the ( innovative ideas ) in a file drawer , and when I get enough money I 'm going to do something about them . " <p> When he talks about this technological wizardry , however , he worries that he might be saying the wrong thing . <p> " I 'm not happy about coming off looking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It really concerns me that I 'm getting a public persona that 's not what it ought to be . " <p> After his troubles in Ohio , Urbanski moved to Anaheim , where , in June 1989 , he leased a large office and tried to " find an investor to help put Endec back on the street . " He lived in the San Clemente house of Max Stitts , a screenwriter and Baptist minister who has nothing but praise for Urbanski . <p> " He 's 100 percent straight up , always above board , " Stitts said . " He 's just a quality person . " <p> But things did not work out in Southern California , and Endec never did get off the ground . Urbanski returned to Columbus , where , he says , he " did some consulting work " and formed a company with Turgeon . Urbanski says they eventually parted for business reasons , but remain friends . <p> According to court records , Urbanski had new business setbacks in the Midwest . Creditors ranging from a department store to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of dollars in debts , and a former investor sued him for allegedly welshing on a business deal . <p> The investor , Richard Keating , charged that Urbanski pocketed a $ 250,000 investment that was intended to help develop a waste-oil reclaiming device . Urbanski said the venture simply did not work out . The case was settled out of court . <p> Searching again for the mother lode , Urbanski headed to Las Vegas and in October 1992 , according to state records , joined up with Stitts and another man to form Teach and Grow Rich , another motivational tape business . But the group failed to raise enough money and the venture folded . <p> Next stop : Tehama County and Celebrity City . <p> Urbanski steadfastly declines to identify his investors . Neither would he discuss the financial details of the investments , partnerships or corporations that eventually would be formed to make up Celebrity City . <p> And Urbanski 's past did not seem to faze Killen , a businessman who enjoys an impeccable reputation in his home state . <p> " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the slightest hint of impropriety , you 've lost me forever , " Killen said . " And he said , ' I do n't want that . ' . . . For two years , I have n't seen the slightest attempt on his part to do anything questionable . I have no regrets about Leo . " <p> Asked about those career ups and downs , Urbanski said : " The American dream is to try to make something work and if you do n't succeed at first , try again . I 've had some successes , and I 've had some failures . But I 've been looking at the picture for a long time . If we make this happen the way it looks like it will happen , the dream will become reality . "
