The other quarterbacks are Warren Moon of the Seattle Seahawks , Rodney Peete of the Philadelphia Eagles , Randall Cunningham of the Minnesota Vikings , Wally Richardson of the Baltimore Ravens and Jay Walker of the Vikings . " It shows that some people have opened their eyes , " Tony Banks told JET . " Unfortunately , you still feel like you have to walk on water , " he said . " The things you do well are obvious .

" I think I 'll be able to deal with it because Pve dealt with a lot over my career , " Moon said . " But this will be a different challenge , believe me . The hard thing for me is I 'm going to be on the sidelines after I 'm already warmed up , and I 'm used to going and starting to play .
