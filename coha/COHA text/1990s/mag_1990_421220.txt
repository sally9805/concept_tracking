Caleb Bach teaches art and Spanish at Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts . He is a freelance writer and researcher . <p> Inlaid with whimsical scenes of everyday life in Jesuit missions , these artistic yet practical barguenos reflect the marriage of European and Indian cultures <p> IT IS FITTING , as we mark the 450th anniversary of the founding of the Society of Jesus , to celebrate a little known but inspired manifestation of that order , namely the barguenos associated with the missions of southeastern Bolivia . Barguenos ( also sometimes called papeleros ) were portable desks with drop fronts and a grid work of drawers inside . Most were used by the priests themselves , but some may have been sold to colonists for additional income . Regardless , they were an integral part of the commerce and good organization for which the Jesuits were famous . In that way they are curiously emblematic of the practical , " corporate " spirit which sustained Ignatius of Loyala 's far-flung compania . <p> Until their expulsion from South America in 1767 , the Jesuits maintained a network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of kilometers north and east of Santa Cruz . These hinterlands , named for the Indians of the area , were so remote that few Europeans , not even the Spanish soldiers , dared explore them . Nonetheless , at the peak of the Jesuit missionary effort , as many as 23 dedicated priests celebrated mass and taught the catechism there , while also supervising an efficient system of cattle ranches , cocoa and sugar cane plantations and artisan workshops . There was even an administrative hub , the port of Paila near Santa Cruz , with a college for novitiates , warehouses , and stockyards . Through this small window to the outside world , they exported their products and maintained contact with the Jesuit headquarters in Cordoba , Argentina . <p> The reducciones ( the term comes from the verb , reducir , meaning to concentrate ) represented the official policy of the Spanish Crown to bring the Indians into townships where they could be instructed in a Christian way of life . The Jesuits , on the front line of this effort , believed that missions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best defense against corrupting influences , not to mention marauding slavers . They sought to create self-sufficient communities which provided the Indians basic religious and academic education , as well as training in an array of practical skills , including stone cutting , carpentry , blacksmithing , printing , painting and calligraphy . The missions were laid out with great care , equipped with sanitation facilities that were quite advanced for their day , and defended by native militia who were carefully trained by the priests . Europeans were only allowed to visit for very brief periods of time , and even then , they were restricted to the guest houses . According to the Chilean historian Gabriel Rene-Moreno , who carefully examined the archives for Chiquitos and Mojos , in 1767 there were 18,535 neophyte Indians in a region of approximately 540 square miles . Furthermore , the Jesuits had managed to build up their herds to 54,345 head of cattle and 26,371 horses . <p> Records , accounts , inventories : that is what the barguenos were all about . Throughout Iberoamerica , these practical pieces of furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people on the move and in need of a portable office . According to Manuel Toussaint , a Mexican authority on Hispanic art and architecture , these chests derived their name from Bargas , a province of Toledo , Spain where they were first made . The Portuguese favored barguenos made of imported hardwoods , such as jacaranda , with thin strips of inlaid ivory . The Spanish , on the other hand , preferred the more flamboyant , baroque style , with ornate carving , polychromy , gold leaf and lacquer work . But for the priests of far-off Mojos and Chiquitos , confronted by a very different reality , a new hybrid style would emerge . It would celebrate the flora and fauna of the region , even life in the mission , in a visual language drawn from Europe . <p> The first wave of Jesuit : : missionaries in South America were Spanish . Since they were competing with Dominicans , Augustinians , and other orders which had staked their claims earlier , they often had to settle for turf far from populated centers . Possessing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they marched into the remotest reaches of Paraguay , Argentina , and Bolivia to set up their well-organized missions . Although these Spanish Jesuits were successful , their numbers were insufficient to man the new outposts of their expanding domain . At first they recruited reinforcements from Naples and the Spanish Netherlands , and when still more were needed , Jesuit priests from the Hapsburg Empire were pressed into service . Priests with names like Mesner , Ott , Gletle and Brunner , Paucke , Sepp and Berger ran many reducciones . Silesia , Bavaria , Bohemia , and the Tirol were transported to South America . <p> One of the priests particularly active in the Chiquitos Region was named Martin Schmid . He was born in 1694 in Baar , Switzerland and would die back in his homeland six years after the Jesuit expulsion . Typical of his countrymen , he respected hardwork and practical skills . But he was also a cultured man , the product of an education at the Jesuit seminary in Landsberg , Bavaria . Schmid , like other outstanding musicians produced by this school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of all sorts of musical instruments . Determined to have quality pipe organs for his missions , he actually took leave of his regular duties in Chiquitos to study the craft of organ building in Potosi . In time , he and his colleagues taught the Indians how to build a broad range of musical instruments using sophisticated joinery and marquetry techniques . They applied these same methods to the manufacture of fine furniture . <p> Marquetry , the art of inlaid wood , and its close cousin , intarsia , literally " mosaic in wood , " were popular in Renaissance Italy . Gradually these techniques gained favor in the alpine regions of Europe where the " busyness " of the surface appealed to the Germanic folk esthetic which abhored empty spaces . Cradles , armoirs , chests , even dining tables with replicas of food and utensils , all done in inlaid wood , delighted their owners , not to mention the craftsmen who filled long winters executing the painstaking process . It was not uncommon for young men of school age to learn basic inlay techniques as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author 's great grandfather as late as the 19th century ) , particularly in the Jesuit order which placed great stock in practical , hands-on skills . <p> It is little wonder then that when these priests , like Schmid , arrived at their new posts , they carried with them not only technical know-how but also the stylistic traits of their homeland : intricate floral motifs , fanciful animals , figurative narratives guaranteed to make the eye dance . There in the wilds of Bolivia , as incongruous as it may seem , they began to embellish the basic Spanish mission structure with painted flowers , sunbursts , stiff Romanesque angels and fantastic architectural detailing right out of Bohemia , Bavaria , and the Tirol . A similar treatment was given to the interiors , including ceiling beams , alters , pulpit and Lenten curtains ( the latter resemble the Danish and Flemish curtains ) . <p> But it was the furniture , particularly the barguenos , which received the full force of Germanic whimsy , perhaps because their purpose was largely secular . The clerics , in concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contrasting natural woods : comical mermaids strumming lyres and frock coated hunters blowing their horns , an unconscious reference perhaps , to the music that was central to mission life . Other scenes featured a great tangle of vines and tropical blossoms magically flowing from a vase balanced on a woman 's head . In this verdant " hair " parrots and owls squawked and hopped from limb to limb while cows grazed far below . <p> It is fair to ask whether there was an indigenous ingredient in all of this and the answer is a resounding " yes . " Despite patronizing comments on the part of some priests who claimed the Indians could only immitate , never innovate , quietly the latter left their own indelible mark on these pieces . The compositions often had much in common with the complex Andean textiles and the inlaid work found on the wooden drinking vessels , queros , of the altiplano . The scenes themselves featured Indian caciques , dressed much like Inca emperors , or natives hunting game in the bush or prodding livestock . In one touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priests wait by the chapel to administer last rites while bells toll and bearers carry the deceased . The situation is timeless and universal as mourners or perhaps just curious onlookers peek through the fence of the churchyard . <p> As in Europe , within the Mojos and Chiquitos region there were several variations on the basic bargueno . A free standing type called a papelero had short , stubby legs , whereas others had a front panel which opened like a door with the hinge to the side . A smaller , stouter version , with handles on the end , a sturdy lock , and a hidden compartment clearly was used as a money box . The much taller contadores stacked in a modular fashion , three tiers high , often sporting the Hapsburg coat-of-arms , the double-headed eagle . Yet another style , fashioned from the harder cocobolo wood , featured a combination of inlaid work on the drop front only with ornately carved drawers inside . These chests had a strong churrigueresque flavor to them , influenced by the Andean highland styles . Finally , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of barguenos evolved , with cursory floral motifs but rarely any pictorial treatment . Almost always they had some inlaid work in freshwater shell which gave them a distinctly Oriental quality . <p> With the demise of the reducciones in South America , the production of the Jesuit style bargueno ceased almost immediately . The raison d'etre for these chests evaporated as quickly as the priests , who were unceremoniously packed off to Europe . Undoubtedly some barguenos found new owners  --  the Indians themselves and colonists who were attracted to their undeniable charm  --  but it is equally true that many simply perished like the missions . Today the most representative selection resides in the Museo de Arte Hispanoamericano Isaac Fernandez Blanco on Calle Suipacha in downtown Buenos Aires . Other examples can be found in the Museo Historico Provincial Marques de Sobremonte in Cordoba , Argentina and the Complejo Museografico Enrique Udaondo in Lujan ( province of Buenos Aires ) . In Bolivia , the chests are found both in private collections and notably in the museum of the University of Chiquisaca in Sucre . <p> There is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye and demand close inspection . They ca n't help but conjur in the imagination that fleeting encounter between central Europeans and native Americans in one of the remotest corners of the world . The barguenos evoke a sense of harmony between two very disparate peoples and in that , they symbolize a tiny episode in the " holy experiment " which began four and one-half centuries ago . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Two distinct styles of barguenos prevailed : the elaborately carved Spanish barroque , above left , and the Portuguese marquetry , inlaid with ivory , mother-of-pearl and exotic woods , above <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Missions such as Concepcion , left and right , in the Chiquitos and Mojos region functioned as outposts of the Jesuit corporate enterprise as well as centers of education , music and art <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Although some barguenos depict clearly European styles and themes , as in the mermaid with a lyre , top left , others show the distinct interpretation of the Indian artists , as in the details of a child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left .
