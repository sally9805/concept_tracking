Some things , by their very nature , are very hard to investigate calmly and objectively ... <p> The derelict starliner was enormous and dark , looming up in front of them as big as a moon , a black silhouette that engulfed the stars . She was crossing the Yankee Shadow 's trajectory , and , with just a little bit of luck , the Shadow would hit her dead center . At a quarter the speed of light , it was going to be a spectacular meeting . Onboard the Yankee Shadow , the captain and first mate had no opportunity to react , not even to make a decision regarding their destination or their limited fuel supply . The starship 's automatic deflection systems took over , with clanging alarms to warn of an abrupt and high-speed change of course . Captain Raymond Harris , seated at the bridge , leaped to his controls , startled into full alertness by the noise and sudden course-shift straining the very bones of his ship . By the time his partner , Rokey , had been wakened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Shadow was braking with painfully extravagant use of fuel , managing to trans form the collision trajectory into orbit around the giant luxury liner . Captain Harris had programmed and trained those automatic pilot systems himself . The Yankee Shadow was going to save their lives , no matter what it cost . It cost . Once in orbit , there she would have to remain . There was no longer enough reaction mass left to break free and go anywhere . The automatics had burned up the Shadow 's entire meager supply of hydrate fuel cells , " pressed ice " as it was known in spacer circles , in order to decelerate , diverting their trajectory from a crash into an orbit around the giant starship . They had come through the Intraspace window with just enough to get to the fuel station in this system and land for refueling , counting on a little luck along the way . Luck had brought them instead into a dead-end orbit around a dead hulk . They had battery power for life support and some antigravity control , but without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbit . That derelict starship was big . The Yankee Shadow had dropped out of the Intraspace window in a system that was , according to all the map books , Coast Guard approved and travel-lane restricted despite its extreme remoteness from all centers of interstellar civilization , and its even more extreme isolation from official connections to things like the Coast Guard . The Shadow should have had a clear lane between system entry and landing at the fuel-station stopover on the single planet listed in the books as worth stopping at . Everything else in the system was virgin territory , explore-me-and-die type planets , and no one had found anything here worth risking the " and-die " part . This ghost ship , this giant , derelict promise of salvage splendor , had wandered in from the everlasting dark of Intraspace . While still alive and sailing among the stars of the Milky Way , she had been a beautiful ship , of the wealthy Bell Crystal line , a magnificent luxury starliner built for rich people from rich worlds on slow cruises to rich vacation spots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparent spiral of the Intraspace drive engines was wrapped around the globe ship like a glass snake coiled around a glittering Tiffany egg . Even in death , she was a beautiful thing . Their timing in coming out of the Intraspace window had been perfect  --  even five minutes difference either way and they would have missed the ghost ship completely , free to continue on to the fuel station and safety . Once the excitement was over , and they were certain they were alive , they found there was an automatic radio beacon with a recorded warning about the derelict 's path . The ten-year-old message was n't encouraging , either . It identified the derelict starliner as the Narridge Hoad , worth a vast fortune in salvage , but apparently impossible to collect . " The damn ship 's haunted , " the message announced , the voice of the man giving the message sounding angry and confused . " She killed every damn thing onboard . " He told them about how the Hoad had come through the Intraspace window a decade ago , unexpected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct hit on the fuel station planet at very high speed . A tug ship had gone out and towed her into a stable solar orbit , thus saving the station world , but the tug had not herself survived the task . " The Hoad is a death trap , , the message went on . " Do n't board her . Do n't land on her . Do n't even orbit . " The man in the warning message looked damaged , with dark circles under sunken eyes , and raw scratches on forehead and cheek . One arm was roughly bandaged with torn cloth . He had a parrot on his shoulder , and the bird had also been through an ordeal . He sat in a ragged , hunched crouch , his crest missing half its feathers , and the skin around his yellow eyes was bare and puffy , as if a bird could cry . " I 'm Captain Melchior of the Blue Heaven , " the man in the automated message said . " We went in to rescue the tug crew after they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , if you ask me . Tow cable blew and spun her out of control from its oscillations . I had a crew of six when I went into the Hoad . " He shook his head in dismay , gesturing to the parrot . " Only Danny here made it out alive with me . Even Dan 's little cousin Albert was lost . " " They ate him , " the bird broke in . His voice was a harsh imitation of his owner . " We did not eat him ! " Captain Melchior exclaimed , turning his head to frown at the bird on his shoulder " They ate him , " Danny bird repeated . Melchior turned back to the screen , explained with an apologetic smile , " The damn bird panicked and flew into an open circuit , and it fried him . " " And then they ate him . " Danny Bird blinked around at them with sullen bird eyes . " I 'll eat you if you do n't shut up about that . We did n't eat Albert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to its shoulders , ruffling feathers stiffly . Captain Melchior shook his head sadly . " I got to get us out of here . Dan new er talked like this before . It was as bad for him as us . That ship is death . There 's no treasure . All you 'll find in there is Death Walking . " " They ate him , " Danny interrupted . " We did not eat him ! " Melchior put out a hand to Danny and set him off screen . " Do n't mind the bird , " he said . Just stay the hell away from that ship ! " " That 's a big help , " Ray said unhappily after the automatic message had signed off . " You think they really did eat the parrot ? " Rokey asked . " Would n't you ? " Rokey shrugged . " It 's a cold universe out there , old man , " Ray said to his partner with a grin . " Birds get eaten . " " Even talking ones , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rokey pushed himself up from his copilot 's seat at the dash . The big Wozurn 's joints creaked as he stretched his arms , groaning at the stiffness , trying to make his fingers work . He shook once sharply to resettle his pelt of thick , black fur , and then wished he had n't . He had been asleep at his controls , and his eyes , usually copper-colored , were dark red with fatigue and hangover . His big , triangular ears were still cold , still ringing slightly . Even his whiskers hurt , all nine of them . Rokey tried not to let them move as he spoke . " Want some breakfast ? " he mumbled to Ray . Ray shrugged . " I guess . " The Earthman and the Wozurn were alien to one another , but it was the ways in which they were alike that kept the peace onboard the Yankee Shadow . Ray looked up at Rokey and frowned . " Should I make breakfast for you ? " Ray said . " You look awful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when did you learn to cook ? " As their orbit carried them in view of the remains of the tug that had crashed into the liner , Ray raised all the Shadow 's long range scopes and studied the wreckage carefully , in close-up detail . After a time he sat back in his seat , staring gloomily at the ship . She filled the view everywhere . Rokey could see the troubled expression on the man 's lean face settle into angry lines . Rokey knew when his captain was trying to digest unpleasant information . " I spent hundreds of hours as a little kid crawling around the hull of our ship looking for line breaks , " Ray said finally . " As soon as I was big enough to fit into a skinsuit , Dad started teaching me ship 's maintenance . He used to say , " Little eyes and little hands can find little problems , and stop them before they become big problems . That way little eyes and little hands will live to grow up . " So I looked for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he ? " Ray shrugged , flashing a quick , pained grin at his alien friend . His green eyes were suddenly clear and deep with memory . " He was n't too comfortable with kids , " he said . " We got on better once I grew up . " Ray was roaming the galaxy trying to find his parents , separated from them by a military warrant when he was barely out of his teens , and Ray was not a young man anymore . Rokey changed the subject . " You think that cable was deliberately cut ? " he asked . " I know it was , " Ray replied . " Space rock leaves carbon streaks across the face of the cut , and that makes the cut sparkle . That cable was burnt smooth , and at a clean angle . can tell by how bright it shines that it was laser-ut . I 'm certain of it . " " Evidently someone wanted to sabotage the towing operation , but why ? They did n't know she was coming . Or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was leaning forward at the dash , directing the Shadow 's scope cameras with deft , sure gestures . The view in the main screen shifted from the black tangle of floating tow cable to the wreckage of the tug . A lone corpse spun in lazy circles , flung out of the ship but caught by its safety line . The arms were spread wide as though in greeting , and the ice frozen on the face glittered as the body circled in its endless dance with the death ship . The tug was buried in the side of the starliner , with only her drive tubes and the tow cable visible above the ship 's skin . The close-up in the monitor showed that the starliner 's automatic repair systems had sealed the skin around the wreckage of the tug , gluing her into place where she had died . " We 'll have to go in through the Hoad herself to get to the tug , " Ray said , gesturing to the screen . " We 'd have to cut through the drive tubes to get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep space work . " " Why should she ? You refuse to do hull maintenance , and I do n't know how . " Ray grimaced curtly and shut off the monitor screen . " Why do we have to get to the tug ? " Rokey asked him . " Pressed ice , " Ray said . " Tugs carry good supplies , lots of backup . There should be some we can salvage to get us out of here . We only stopped by here for fuel anyway . " " How are we going to get down there ? " Rokey asked . He was already getting a feeling of being trapped . " We 're out of fuel ! " Ray 's discomfort showed in his face , but he put on a brave smile . " The computer has done the math . We only need a little bit of reaction mass to brake enough to fall down to the surface . I can find enough for that if I empty out the weapons locker . We do n't need much . I just have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landing bays . " " How very clever of you and your ship , " Rokey said lightly . He tried to smile . He could see by the slight knit of Ray 's brow that he was only moderately certain of his plan . " It will take about four days for us to fall all the way to the surface , " Ray said . " You 've got time to take a nap . " " And a meal , " Rokey said as he went out . " We may need a good meal before going into that place . Death Walks , remember ? " Ray said nothing , but sat staring at the beautiful dead thing turning slowly in his view . Ray was very clever about the maneuver , but it was close . Rokey said nothing , watching the gauge lines and scope readouts with remote attention . Rokey trusted Ray 's instincts with his starship , and he had long ago learned to wait until after the disaster to ask Ray to explain . The solid thunk of the docking grapples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite the air of mystery that surrounded the Nar ridge Hoad . They waited to find out if the starliner 's automatic systems still functioned adequately to restore the atmosphere in the docking bay . All systems worked . The passengers and crew were dead , but the ship herself still lived , awaiting command . " Suits , " Ray said tersely . " Until we know what killed those people . " Rokey made a face , whiskers drawn forward tightly , but he did not argue . Death came in many forms , carried on many vectors , hiding in innocent , open places . Even the spacesuit might not be enough to protect him from whatever haunted the giant cruiseliner . He went to get his suit out and check the seals . Rokey , once the exalted " Lord Rokhmyr , Earl of Rokherton Keep and President of Rokherton University , " was nearly a hundred years old before he ever put on a spacesuit , but that day was itself more than a century and a half ago . He had started young for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any age , Wozurn fur pelts just do n't fit all that comfortably inside plastic casing , no matter how skillfully designed nor how patient the wearer . Worst of all , you ca n't smell anything inside a spacesuit except your own biology . Rokey 's ultra-refined sense of smell was not only central to his sense of orientation , but also central to his sense of joy in life . Spacesuits were n't just isolating , they were boring . He studied the dense black fur of his forearms with a twitch of his sensitive whiskers . The clutch and grab of the suit sleeves was always the most uncomfortable , especially if he had to do any shooting . Rokey 's suit was transparent , with a big , glasside globe helmet that gave his ears and whiskers room , and a ring of bubble filters like fat black beads around the sealing rim . If the atmosphere was n't too poisonous , the suit would let some scents from the outer world filter through , some awareness of the breezes and the movements of the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sealing the suit into a self-contained , vector-proof environment . He hoped . Their suit radios carried every exhalation and sigh . On ordinary spacesuited ventures , they put on the audio filters to screen that out . The sound of someone breathing in your earpiece for too long can produce strange , angry thoughts , but in this case , Rokey felt that the sound of his partner 's breath would be a subliminal cue that would help compensate for the lack of smell . Going out into a pitch-black night would have been less troublesome for Rokey than the blocked-smell blindness of a spacesuit . In a dark night he could at least still smell his way around . He could n't find his way around inside a spacesuit in broad daylight , and that made him as nervous as the memory of Captain Melchior 's anxious twitch , and the parrot with puffy , tear-strained eyes . Rokey returned the suit to its locker . If he was going trekking through a ghost ship while uncomfortable , he should at least have a good meal first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rokey was certain of that . Captain Ray Harris " long , lean self , tall and too thin for Rokey 's taste , made a gold-coated wire sculpture once suited up in his elaborate and shiny spacesuit . There were scorch marks along the back tanks and across the thighs from one of the captain 's earlier encounters with innocent native confusion . Ray could have cleaned the carbon-scoring away completely , but he left it as reminder to watch his back when in alien swamps . Ray and Rokey were not greeted by a swamp this time . The enormous landing bay of the Narridge Hoad was as elegant as a ballroom , all its ornate fittings polished and gleaming despite the abandonment that shrouded every dark corner , despite the emptiness that echoed . They both felt the need to speak in hushed tones , or perhaps even to whisper . The subdued lighting was intended to be a gentle greeting to disoriented travelers , but here and now it seemed the subtle lighting of a tomb . There were no hard shadows anywhere , and the exits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embedded in the floor everywhere as guides . Just inside the main entrance foyer , a long-dead corpse lay sprawled in loose shapes , a pile of bones and fabric heaped against the door . Deep scratches , short and furious , marred the hard mahogany veneer , showing the ship 's steel beneath . There were words on the wall above the corpse , scrawled by finger smears in some unthinkable ink : KILLED BY THAT SLEEPER IN THE HEART ! " It 's hard to tell after so much time , " Ray said . He was on one knee beside the corpse , examining it with the scopes of his spacesuit helmet-lenses . " But it looks like the classic **31;630;TOOLONG . I think that 's the cranium . " Even the native species of the dead alien was difficult to discern , dissolved by death into the anonymity of the basic humanoid form . The bones were n't Earther but that was all Ray could tell . The airlock opened when Rokey put his hand to the control panel , and the corpse collapsed across the threshold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have finally crossed the boundary it had guarded so faithfully for so long . Ray and Rokey had to push it inside so that the airlock could close . The body fell apart as they moved it , leaving a jumble of parts beside the door . The ship 's automatic lights came on as they entered the main lobby . All was silent , and the darkness seemed to flee into corners and hide behind lounge chairs and travelogue displays . An eerie jitteriness hung in the air , dimly colored sparkles just out of the corners of the eye . Ray hurried over to the directory kiosk at the center of the open lobby , to study the ship 's layout displayed there . Rokey trailed after , looking around at the luxurious space and shaking his head . There was something very wrong about this ship . He could feel it in the pads of his feet , feel it resonating in his sensitive face whiskers despite the isolation of his spacesuit . " OK , we take that exit , " Ray said , pointing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be a long walk to the crash site . " " I wore my comfortable shoes . " " I bet inside that spacesuit you 're barefoot.n " Is n't that what I just said ? " The ship was dark , but Ray and Rokey 's living movement activated the corridor lights to a nightglow softness wherever they entered . The ship 's automatics had translated the sleep of the dead as her passengers " night time , and kept the corridors dark for their final dreams . The Narridge Hoad had been carrying tens of thousands of passengers . Bodies lay in mummified poses at every turn of the corridor , and piled in the crossways . The immediacy of death was dissolved in the slow horror of desiccated flesh and empty eyes . Over the years servomechs had cleaned up the blood around the fallen passengers , and kept the corpses tidy . Rotting flesh was neatly carried away , and white bone showed in the smaller bodies . The passengers and crew were predominantly of Earth descent , or at least humanoid , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The huge saurian aliens had taken many others down with them . Their dinosaur  --  like bodies were surrounded by piles of dried corpses , broken and flung against walls and into corners . The deep gouges of the Arrglyddians " powerful hindclaws marred the luxurious elegance of the ballrooms and corridors where they had died , with chandeliers pulled down from the ceilings , furniture crushed and doors buckled . On the walls above every corpse , hand-scrawled in the same gory ink , was the same phrase , in the same barely legible handwriting : KILLED BY THAT SLEEPER IN THE HEART ! Ray 's sense of direction inside a starship was as reliable as instinct , and Rokey followed his captain without noting direction or place . The gloom and resonance of pain that met them wherever the lights flared on created a growing sense of danger in Rokey 's own instincts that seemed to blur his peripheral vision and rattle his bones . There was something wrong about this ship , something more wrong even than the violence and tragic death everywhere , and the wrongness increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther ? " Rokey asked Ray finally . His voice sounded harsh inside the globe of his helmet . " Three corridor lengths and two flights of stairs , " Ray said curtly as answer . " Ten more minutes . " Rokey could see , even through the helmet , that the man 's face was pale , his mouth set in a tense , angry curve . Ray was not watching where he walked , but studying the suit monitor readouts and visual displays from his various suit lenses in his heads up display . He was studying the passages in a variety of wavelengths of light , searching the walls and doorways as carefully as the corpses they passed . Ray stopped finally , and turned to Rokey behind him . " Look at this , " he said . The taut concern in his voice caught Rokey by surprise . The man was afraid . Fear infuriated Ray , and this conflict of emotions rang through his voice . Ray had dialed up the brightness of his heads-up display so that it reflected more clearly across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ghost of Ray 's face behind . " Something is drifting through here in the infrared , " Ray said . " Do you see it ? " Both men stood unmoving as if staring face to face . Rokey saw nothing on the faceplate but the rippled shapes of their own infrared outlines . The corpses did n't show . They were all long cold . Tense minutes passed , and Rokey still saw nothing but Ray 's green eyes searching the display . Then Rokey watched those eyes track something . " There ! " Ray exclaimed . " Did you see it ? " " No , " Rokey said . A cold hand seemed to brush against his ears , sending a shudder through his muscles . " No , I did n't see anything , but I can tell that you did . " " Grid , " Ray swore softly . The projected display disappeared , showing Ray 's pale , angry face clearly again . " I saw it plain as I see you . " " Did it look anything like Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , " Ray said uneasily as he turned to continue on down the dark corridor . " That 's just what it looked like . " KILLED BY THAT SLEEPER IN THE HEART ! was smeared on every wall , chronicling the death over and over with the same declaration . Children and pets had not escaped the massacre . Indeed , deeper into the ship , they seemed to have drawn a particularly virulent form of the madness to themselves , as though their very innocence had driven some violent frenzy in their attackers . Both men had their suit recorders on , audio as well as trideo , and neither could bear to look , finally letting their suit lenses take in the scene . The soft velvet comfort of this luxurious , elegant starship was the dignified wrapping around death and terror , a luxury made stark by the dried and tidy dead . Rokey kept his eyes on the back of Ray 's goldtone suit and tried not to step on the man 's heels . The broken body of the spaceship tug had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions of servomechs through the years . The side of the tug that had struck was crushed , and melted into the starliner in places , as though the crash had merged them into one . Once they stood close enough to see details , Rokey saw that burnt feathers stuck out from a smashed panel in the damaged hull . Blackened bird bones were still meshed with the broken circuit that had killed it . From the look of the charred flesh , Melchior had told the truth . " So they did n't eat him , after all , " Rokey said . " I wonder why Danny thought they had ? " " This place is non-stop paranoia in every breath , " Ray said tautly . " What else would a bird who hangs out with spacers be paranoid about ? " Rokey chuckled . " Being eaten . " The starliner 's outer hull had been repaired around the tug , and sealed airtight . Left to the task without human guidance , random errors had built a bizarre termites " nest of protective layers around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fulfilling its directive to protect its human charges from themselves as well as from the implacable nature of reality . The Narridge Hoad had failed to protect her human charges from the Sleeper , whatever that was , and the residue of that tragedy touched everything . " Can we get in there ? " Rokey asked . " We have to , " Ray answered . " And fast . There 's something wrong with this place . I can feel it . " Rokey could feel it as well . The wrongness seemed to grow with every breath , every step forward they took . His fur trembled with it , ripples of black energy that tugged at the back of his eyes and tickled his ears . " Good plan , " he said to Ray . " Let 's get out before the Sleeper wakes . " They climbed in through a great , wide split in the tug 's side , webbed around its edges with those dried threads . No automatic lights came on in here . This ship was truly dead , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of the wreckage  --  smashed deck plates and twisted hull struts with splayed photon tubes festooning cracked control panels . Ray had to stop often as they worked their way to the engine room . The damage was so severe that it was difficult to identify what part of the tug they were in . Rokey began to worry that Ray had overestimated the possibility of finding usable fuel cells here , but he kept that worry to himself . Ray was clearly agitated enough on his own . They did not find bodies on the tug , despite the severity of the crash . Captain Melchior had apparently gotten them all off the tug before losing them to " That Sleeper In The Heart " on the way back to the Blue Heaven . Rokey began thinking about that as he followed Ray 's precarious passage through the wrecked corridors . " Here it is . " Ray interrupted Rokey 's gloomy thoughts , stopping before a broad stretch of hull . The deck was canted at an unpleasant angle , and Rokey nearly lost his balance trying not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand against the hull , and was surprised when it crumbled away at his touch . " What 's here ? " he said grumpily as he hastily checked his glove and sleeve for tears . " Engineering . " Ray said tersely . " If there 's any pressed ice left , it will be on the other side of this stretch of hull here . " Ray pushed against it as if it would fall away at his touch . It did , crumbling into sharply cornered shards as it fell . Both men leaped back abruptly to avoid the falling pieces , and they kept moving back as the cloud of carbon dust rose slowly around it . The black dust rippled in the air as it fell , as though dancing with the light . Once that had settled , the men returned to shine their lamps into the darkness of the chamber beyond . Ray told Rokey to wait in the corridor , and he climbed over the debris into that dark . Rokey stayed put , peering through the hole in the hull to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinner by the time Ray returned carrying a simple floater pack that trailed behind him . Two small cartons were strapped to the pack . Rokey knew at once what that meant , but he stood stoically waiting for Ray to tell him . " We 've got enough to keep life support going , " Ray said . His voice in the suit radio was level , calm , terrified . " Melchior was right . This tug died in a damned peculiar accident . " Rokey did not ask him to explain that . Some day , over drinks , Ray would put all the details into logical order for his partner . Rokey would n't ask for something Ray had not yet explained to himself . The edge in Ray 's voice was story enough . " Have I got time to sit down while you work out our next plan ? " Rokey said . He was not smiling , and his voice held not the slightest note of mockery . The spacesuit had wearied him . He wanted to sit down , but in the suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tension that had been gathering in the lines around his eyes eased into smiles . " I think we better both sit down , " he said . They did , in the corridor outside the dead hulk of the tug . Rokey regarded the meager supply of energy in the packages of pressed ice on the floater . Even Rokey knew how much time they represented . " We have to go up to the bridge of the Hoad , " Ray said after many long minutes of silence had become awkward . " I can look at the engineering logs there . " Rokey stood without speaking , and followed Ray as he walked away from the remains of the tug that had died to save the fuel-station planet from the dead Narridge Hoad . The bodies were piled deeper , and the evidence of violence harsher as they approached the ship 's bridge . The Hoad 's crew had barricaded themselves in as a last defense against some frightful enemy . " Who were they fighting ? " Ray demanded . He turned slowly on his heel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carnage . The blood had been scrubbed away by the patient machines , but they could not remove the looks of terror on the dried faces of the dead . " What were they fighting ? " Rokey needed to reach inside his spacesuit and comb down the ruff of fur around his neck . He was scared , and not about fuel cells or dead batteries . There was also evidence that Melchior and his men had gone up to the bridge . Someone had pushed corpses aside and burned open the bridge entry . Ray and Rokey went inside , guns drawn . The bridge crew had met the same fate as the passengers . Some terrible violence had rent them all , despite discipline , training and an arsenal of hand weapons . KILLED BY THAT SLEEPER IN THE HEART was scrawled in foot-high letters across the floor and across the bodies in the path of the words . Ray and Rokey were both careful not to step on the lettering , although neither man was ready to acknowledge why . Only the captain had remained at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge . The rest were scattered , dead in groups and piles . The captain was a square , clean-cut man with big , sharp features and thick eyebrows that made a single straight line between his forehead and his eyes . His hands were straight and his bones were straight , and his bright white uniform was perfectly pressed . Even in death , he was neatly presented to the world . Someone had slashed his throat wide open , and the copious sweep of blood soaking into his white uniform was the single imperfection to his stylish , military facade . They stood for a moment surveying the wreckage on the bridge , the extent of the damage . " If everything up here has been wrecked like this , " Rokey wanted to know , " Why have the life-support automatics worked for the last ten years ? " " Because they are automatic . On a passenger ship life-support systems have primary priority . The automatics are hardwired into the ship 's superstructure itself . They 'll run as long as they have access to the batteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And we want to get access to those batteries ? " Ray nodded absently . He was crouched in front of the least damaged section of the bridge control systems , studying the surviving circuits with a close-up lens on the front of his suit he met . Random lights flickered here and there in response to Ray 's coaxing , flashes of voice recordings , but he was unable to pull up any coherent information . He fussed with the panel for a time , and finally got a sputtering display on one monitor . He stood up to watch it play , then ran it through it a second time . " This is the last bit of data left in the buffer of the captain 's log , " Ray explained . " It was n't hit when this panel was smashed up . " The captain was shown close-up , talking hastily into the log recorder in the arm of the command chair . " . . until they break in here . I 've never had a crew mutiny on me , " he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an angry scowl , but his eyes were afraid . " I 've never even heard of passengers on a luxury cruise committing mutiny . This is madness . The very fabric of this ship has gone insane . I ca n't stop it any longer . My own sanity is slipping . " He looked around the bridge with growing desperation . Sounds of screams from off-camera cut across his words . al ca n't get to the heart to stop it anymore . We 're blockaded in here now . They do n't know what 's in the heart . No one believes . " That was all there was . " Can you locate engineering ? " Rokey asked . Ray looked around at the savaged instruments and destroyed computer layouts . " Yes . It 's got to be onboard somewhere . He turned away and headed for the exit . Rokey followed after . The only ship 's directories they could find were all passenger-oriented . Passengers did not need to locate engineering , and were actively discouraged from visiting there anyway . Ray did some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lights flickered on in their path and faded out again behind them as they walked . Because the passengers had been kept away from engineering , the sullen sweep of death had not filled the corridors here . The three women who had been on duty were dead , though , sprawled awkwardly in their seats , limp rag dolls long ago gone dry and brittle . Each had been shot in the back by a hot , hard burn , taking out most of the spine , and the look frozen on their faces was that of surprise , not fear . Ray worked around them , studying the control layout and touching knobs and keypads to test responses . Rokey wandered until he found a workbench he could sit down on . The dim lighting and hushed , strained atmosphere were taking their toll on his patience . " Could we just call the fuel station and ask them to deliver ? " he said finally . " I asked , " Ray replied without looking up from the keypad he was studying . " Melchior 's got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't come within a trillion klicks of the Hoad , not even to save his sainted grandmother . " Rokey grunted a soft , quick noise of shock , and then caught his breath . Who would think a man like that would be devoted to his grandmother ? " he said instead of the sudden expletives that had risen to his tongue . This information explained Ray 's intensity and willingness to gamble on finding fuel cells surviving on the Narridge Hoad . Their only other option was to wait until another ship came through the Intraspace window , and radio them for either a lift or at least a phone call to the Coast Guard at their next stop-and hope they were n't the type who would consider the Yankee Shadow as fair salvage . This was a remote system , not on any regular schedule with anyone , and they might wait a long time for another ship to come through . Calling the Coast Guard was a genuine last-ditch effort : Coast Guardsmen were officials , and asked a lot of official questions in return for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time , " Rokey said to Ray 's back . Ray did not turn around . " I figured you would worry . " " You figured right . Are you finding anything here ? " Ray sighed , and turned around to look at Rokey . " They 're in the hold , " he said . Ray looked down and touched the edge of the console where the dead women sat . " Before they were killed , these ladies were trying to debug the virus in the ship 's superstructure command system that had locked the hold from the inside , which is something the cargo hold systems are n't supposed to do . " The long , chestnut-red locks of one woman were draped across the console where she had slumped forward . They concealed her face , and the rich curls were still shiny . The servomechs had tended the messiness of death here as well . Except for the burned-edge hole in her torso , she might have just fallen asleep at her post . Once Ray had stood for too long staring down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his feet . " Then let 's collect our clues and have a look at what 's in the hold . " Ray did not move right away . He was still staring at the redheaded corpse . The hand resting in her lap was all bone , even though the dawn-colored nail polish was still intact , still brilliant . " The hold is in the very center of the ship , " Ray said finally . " In a globe-design ship like this , the hold is put in the very core , in a null-g spot of antigrav field overlap . " Rokey was not as familiar nor as comfortable with antigravity technology as Ray , and did not understand the significance of Ray 's words . " OK . " Do you know what they call the hold at a null- core ? " " Not a clue , " Rokey said . " Should I ? " Ray pulled himself away from the tragedy of red curls , and touched the controls for the floater pack which drifted up obediently to follow him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much bigger return than tourist dollars , " he said . " For every dollar they get in passenger ticket price , they make ten thousand in cargo . Two passengers and a full hold can still make a run profitable , even for a luxury ship like this . " " Since when do luxury cruise lines carry cargo ? " " It 's Bell Crystal Line 's secret of success . That globe design gives them a lot of interior . " " And everybody wants a window seat when they travel , " Rokey said . " I get it . " " That cargo is the life 's blood of the company , so the hold in the center of the ship is referred to as The Heart . ' " Rokey sighed , wishing again that he could brush down the hackles risen along his back . " That sleeper in the heart . " Ray nodded . Behind doors locked from the inside . " Rokey wished desperately he could comb down his mane . He shook himself roughly inside his suit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Ray . He knew there was more . " According to what 's left of the engineering log , " Ray said , that 's where the pressed-ice supply was stored . Even after ten years there should be plenty to get us through the window and out of this place . If we can get to it . " " And get out alive . " " Someone 's following us , " Ray said . Rokey glanced quickly over his shoulder . He saw only the dimly lit , shadowed corridor and the inevitable dead , but he had felt the shiver , the sensation of eyes watching his back . The hushed velvet stillness and soft light were bleeding reality away in a tangle of desiccation , bone and dread . Forms seemed to flutter at the edges of his sight , and he could hear something . He could n't really hear it , but there was a sound . " Everyone on this ship has been dead for ten years , " Rokey said to Ray , " and now somebody 's following us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's following us . " Rokey needed his nose . If he had been free to smell what was going on , he would have been able to tell at once if there were anyone else onboard with them . Sneaking up on a Wozurn is not an easy task , unless that Wozurn is scent-blinded by a spacesuit . Rokey was mightily tempted to remove the helmet , but the air of madness that hung everywhere in this ship seemed contagious , and Rokey was not inclined to tempt whatever vector was out there carrying that madness . If his suit could protect him . It was not protecting him from the growing sense of foreboding , of wrongness about this place . Maybe something was following them . Rokey stayed two paces behind Ray to cover his back , and kept looking over his shoulder . He began to see shadows moving . Ray stopped abruptly , gesturing for Rokey to stop . Rokey froze . He could hear Ray 's breathing in the suit radio , harsh and ragged , as though he were holding down a rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rokey whispered . " It 's up ahead of us . " " You said it was following us . " Ray turned just enough to look at Rokey . " Yeah , I did , did n't I ? " " Does this mean we 're surrounded ? " Rokey was still whispering . He regretted at once the flipness of the remark , but Ray grinned sharply . " It means this damn ship is haunted , is what it means , " Ray said . " Ghosts did n't kill all those people . " Ray boosted the power on the lamp on the top of his helmet and turned back to the darkness ahead . " What makes you so sure ? " Rokey wished he had an answer to that . He could feel the eyes all around them as well . He just did n't want to believe they were there . It was a long walk . Ray had to burn open the locks on several doors marked " Staff Only " and , at each one , they went through with guns drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same carnage long smoothed away . " What a great commercial this would be for the company that makes those servomechs , " Rokey said at one point . " I can just see it-More reliable than life itself ' . " Ray was not amused . In fact , Ray was becoming increasingly agitated . Rokey could hear it in the oddly spiked rhythm of the man 's breathing in his suit radio . Rokey was accustomed to his partner 's emotional interaction with the world around him , an interaction that turned easily to passion . Rokey considered this a sign of Ray 's moral character , but sometimes it just plain infuriated him . Ray Harris did not know how to walk away from anything . Rokey realized that a lot of things about Ray infuriated him , and having to follow him around in the dangerous dark , ice-fishing , was at the top of the list . Rokey 's ears itched , and the fur on his forearms hurt now from the constant irritation of the suit sleeves . Wearing this ridiculous spacesuit was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " games , playing at space opera and saw ing all the ladies-all the re &eads,; anyway . Rokey wanted to go home to the peace and quiet of his own bed . It was damn noisy in this place , despite the constant hush of the dead . Rokey caught himself at that , appaled at his own line of thinking . His ears did itch , and what was all that invisible sound ? " What 's all that noise ? " he asked Ray . His ears felt stopped up , as though there were a silence so loud that everything else was muffled . " You 're the one with the big ears , " Ray snarled . " You tell me . " Rokey 's alarm grew . It was Ray 's voice , but it did not sound like Ray . There was a flat , frightened meanness totally out of character for the man . The dark corridor walls seemed to pull in , as though the ship were drawing a deep , eager breath . " Captain Harris , what 's that noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put his hand on the hilt of his gun . The touch of it against his gloved fingers shocked him , and he hastily put his hands behind his back , awkward as that was in the suit . He no longer trusted himself . Ray whirled around , facing Rokey with an angry grimace twisting his features . His eyes were blazing with rage , and his face was white . " You 're frightened by noises now , old man ? Now I 'm supposed to save you from things that go bump in the night ? " " Ray , " Rokey forced calm into his voice . " What in the scubb 's got into you ? . Ray blinked , drawing back as though startled awake . The rage drained out of his face , leaving his green eyes wide and scared in an ashen face . " I do n't know , Rokey . I just . . . This place is haunted . " " I 'm scared , too , " Rokey said to him . " There is something wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not me . Just keep that in mind . " Ray nodded , struggling to calm his ragged breathing . " Sorry about that , old man . " " Never mind , " Rokey said , " but what 's that sound ? " " What sound ? " " That sound that is n't quite there , that 's too big to hear ? You do n't hear it ? , Ray grinned , somewhat recovered . " How do I answer a question like that ? " Rokey felt some of his angry terror fade . " Metaphysically absurd , is n't it ? " He chuckled , shaking his head . " But it 's there . " Ray looked down to his suit control panel , made some adjustments on the scanners , and then turned on his heel in a slow circle , searching the display on his faceplate as he turned . Halfway around the second time , he stopped , pointing down the darkened corridor . " It 's up ahead of us , whatever it is . " He shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some kind of sonic energy . It 's off-scale but it is n't audible . " " I trust my bones , " Rokey said . " And something 's rattling them around inside me real good . " " I can feel my skull rattling around in my head if I do n't concentrate . " That comment knocked loose a scrap of data in Rokey 's mind , something that teased at his memory the way the dark teased at vision here . As they continued on , lamps set to bright , Rokey tried to chase down that elusive thought , but the growing pressure of the non-sound made all his thinking musty , secondhand , tired . He followed Ray 's glowing figure , trying not to see eyes in the darkness behind them . Continuing on became increasingly difficult , the sheer physical effort of lifting their feet and pushing the air aside to move began to drag on their muscles and scrape painfally at their joints . No matter how brightly they turned up the lights , a mist seemed to hang over everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mist formed faces in outlines of smoke that melted away when looked at directly . Ray walked with the forced stride of combat training , as though willing him self forward , and Rokey 's fur rippled constantly with short , cold shivers of fright . It was , he noted however , a curiously impersonal fright , fear that seemed to grow out of itself , without any true source . Rokey told himself that this was a only a dead starship with an old tragedy , and they were just on a walk to borrow a cup of ice , nothing more . That touch of demon breath was an impossible fantasy . He was wearing a spacesuit . Nothing could touch him but the suit itself . Then the suit whispered to him that she owned him , she had him surrounded , and she would never , never let him free of her . Rokey screamed . Ray was at Rokey 's side in a flash , grabbing his hands as Rokey tried frantically to unlink the gloves . " Rokey ! ! " Ray shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The suit was laughing at him . Hysteria bubbled up in Rokey 's throat , burning his breath away . The suit was going to suffocate him . " Let me out of this thing ! " Rokey cried , writhing inside the constricting coils of the spacesuit . Ray would help him . Ray understood spacesuits , even haunted ones . " Get me out of this thing ! " he pleaded with Ray . " Shes " gone mad ! " Rokey stopped struggling , his ears down flat to his skull . His copper-colored eyes were bright red . " Help me , Ray ! " The sound of the suit 's laughter whispered in his ears , " You 're mine now . . . " Hold still , damn it ! " Ray ordered him sternly . " Hold still , and I 'll get you out of there ! " Rokey froze , letting Ray undo the black-beaded rim seals around the helmet . For a wild flash , Rokey expected his head to come off along with the helmet when Ray lifted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the helmet in Ray 's hand , thinking he could see a face dimly reflected there . Like a child being undressed from a snowsuit , he held out his gloved hands , impatient for Ray to remove them . " Get them off , please , " he whispered . " Do n't let her get me . " Ray undid the security seal links on the cuffs and slid the gloves off . He dropped them into the globe of the helmet , and stepped back , surveying his friend with a keen eye . " It is n't me , and it is n't you , remember , old man ? " he said , with a trace of his cocky stance restored . " Talk to me . " Rokey tried to catch his breath , tried to hear the suit-demon , but Ray 's focused attention had chased the sensation away , proving it to be terror from the peripheral edges of perception . Rokey felt shaken . The voice had been utterly real . He put away immediately the suspicion that Ray had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely than his suit being haunted . He explained to Ray what happened , dismayed by the tremor in his voice . Ray began at once to unsnap the remaining seals on Rokey 's suit , and helped him out of it . While Rokey smoothed his ruffled fur down as best he could with his hands , Ray shook out the suit and carefully folded it away , packing it into the big globe helmet . He strapped the helmet onto the floater with the cartons of pressed ice . " I guess we 've proven that whatever got these people can penetrate a spacesuit , " Ray said . " It does n't matter anymore if you wear it . " " Thanks , " Rokey said to him simply . " I 'm sorry . That was really not what I expected . " " Hauntings come in all colors , " Ray said with a grin . " And now I do n't have to tell you what I was seeing just then . " " What were you seeing ? ? " Rokey exclaimed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now I know it . " " What in the blazing scubb is going on here ? " Rokey demanded . Ray tugged the floater handle to activate it . " Something deadly . Something that drove all those people to kill each other . And right now I 'm really glad that I like you as much as I do . " Rokey felt a great sweep of relief , larger than the fear . " Thanks , mate . Same here . " There were fewer and fewer bodies as they got closer to the cargo hold entrance . Evidently not many had the courage to penetrate so close to this heart of evil . At the entryway itself , a lone body lay stretched out in a last attempt to reach the door . A bony hand pointed to it with clawed fingers . From the uniform , they could see that one of the ship 's top officers had made the desperate effort to break through his own terror and get to the heart . What killed him was not clear , but his dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of that energy field is in there , " Ray said , looking up from the readouts in his suit monitor and gesturing toward the locked hold . " And so are our fuel cells . " " Yes . " " And it 's locked from the inside ? " " Yes . " " And you have a plan ? " " Is n't it your turn to have a plan ? " Ray exclaimed . He was grinning . " I had the last plan . In fact , I 'm two up on you for plans . " I do n't have a plan ! I 'm just following you . " " OK ! OK ! I 've got a plan . " Ray was forcing lightness . The air was so thick with evil intention it seemed to push back at them . They could both taste the fear , but both , having overcome that fear now several times , were increasingly curious about the cause . They needed the fuel cells in that hold , but they needed answers now just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even twice , but not again . The hold entry would not respond to any of Ray 's deft computer work at the control panel . Ray gave up on the polite method , drew his laser , and slowly , methodically burned away the hinge bolts and the lock . He used up the last energy in his laser and finished the job with Rokey 's , leaving it also drained . If there were no fuel cells here , their energy reserves really were at bottom . The last bolt popped away , and the door swung open , teetered , and then toppled over , hitting the carpeted deck with a dull , heavy thud . Both men had guns drawn , even though useless now , expecting the dark of a cargo hold , but instead a dazzling light spilled out of the entry . Hot light and hot air breathed out across them , and with them the sound of hard , low , muttering laughter . The light of the sim-sun in the hold was brilliant yellow , not the white medium of Sol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on every surface , and made the air molten and dense , a light heavy with the weight of its own heat . The throb of danger in the air was as dense , as metallic as the heat . " You 'll feel a gravity-interface step when you go through there , Rokey , " Ray explained tersely . The ship 's antigravity fields are designed to weave a torus around the heart , so that the nullg section is suspended in the center , with the drive engines at the null-g poles , anchoring the field shapes to the hull . " " Ray , that makes absolutely no sense at all ! " Rokey exclaimed . " It does in the mathematics , trust me . " " Then make it make sense to me ! " Ray grinned sharply . " You will be encountering invisible steps , so do n't watch your feet , feel for it with your toes , and you 'll be lighter with each meter , no matter what the ground looks like to your eyes-keep that in mind . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He let Ray go in first , watching him cross the force-field threshold before stepping inside . Each man had a hand held out in front of him like a talisman against the dangerous light . Distance was dissolved in the light and the wind . The hold was a huge chamber nearly five hundred meters wide , globe-shaped , ordinarily filled with cargo in mesh bags hung by lines , floating in the null-gravity point at the ship 's heart . This chamber had been transformed into a desert landscape , with towering sandstone monoliths standing around the rim , holding up the illusion of the hot sky overhead . The wind had carved them with its sandedged teeth into careless demon shapes . The light was too intense to look at anything . Details wavered in the ripples of heat . Quavers that became voices and then wailing and moans of despair swelled up around them as though the ground groaned in pain beneath the pressure of their feet . Winds slashed at them in annoyingly irregular blasts , pulling and tugging at Rokey 's ears with hard child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wind threatened to blow them backwards . Ray forced himself to concentrate on his suit monitors . " It 's right ahead of us , " he said . He had to force his tongue to shape the words . The awful dread had mounted to an unspeakable terror , and his mouth felt glued with wet sand . " Dead center of the ship , at the nullgravity spot , " he said breathlessly . " What 's up there ? " Rokey asked . Neither man could see clearly what was hanging in the air at the ship 's heart . The brilliant sim-sun dazzled vision . The erratic , insistent winds slammed at them with stinging sand , and steam swirled about a half-hidden mass ahead as big , as a whale , that looked , what little of it they could see , like treacle pudding serenely floating in the midst of a sandstorm . Red cherry knobs were studded randomly throughout the treacle and drifted across its pulsing surface , sinking in , popping up . Winds howled , rattling sand with the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread , depression , anxiety , spite , or hatred they had ever felt was now centered in and born out of that hideous , comical horror floating there-treacle and cherries possessed by demons . Waves of incandescent evil radiated from it , rippling through their flesh and leaving a cold , flaming resonance of terror in their bones . It darkened their vision , enfolding them in its perfect misery . Sand danced against them as though trying to warn them away . Ray and Rokey walked toward it in tight step with each other . The treacle pudding became transparent , and one by one the red blobs split open to reveal golden orange eyes . All the many floating eyes were focused on Ray and Rokey . The transparent gel thinned and broke up into hundreds of skull-sized bubbles . These red-eyed bubbles drifted over slowly to cluster around the two men , staring and silent . But with the opening of those alien eyes , the nightmare ended . Ray and Rokey looked around in dazed surprise , aware all at once of a change so abrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just waked from some dreadful dream . Yet they had gone through the nightmare together , and that made it real . Whatever it had been , however , it was over . The winds stilled , dropping the sands with a happy , cascading noise , followed by calm silence . The whispers , the moaning , the fear , everything stopped . Only the visceral resonance was left , already fading on the blood tides . Their heads began to clear as the red  --  eyed bubbles floated up to them . The men lowered their weapons , confused . " Good morning , gentlemen , " the nearest bubble said to them in fluent SpeakEZ . It was as big as Ray 's head , and floated close to his face to speak . " You are not in proper uniform , and I do not recognize you . Has something happened to Captain Walters ? " Ray could only nod . Rokey was still staring around stupidly , struggling to orient himself . " Have we arrived ? " the bubble-with eyes asked . " Is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge might have been in charge of the luxury starliner Narridge Hoad , but the cherry  --  studded treacle in the hold turned out to be the owners not only of the Narridge Hoad but also of the entire Bell Crystal Line . Idalia Hoad , CEO of the company , was spokesman for the treacle . They were Urkaz , amoeba-like aliens from a distant rim world-giant , single-celled beings . They rarely traveled out of their home stellar system , despite owning the largest luxury-starliner manufacturing company in civilization . When Ray and Rokey told CEO Idalia Hoad that Captain Walters as well as everyone else onboard was dead , and how they had died , the aliens all reacted with visible distress . The eyes closed and sank down into the bubble , which changed from a watery transparency to white and then frothy , sickly-green . " How horrid . How horrid , " Idalia Hoad moaned . " Why were you here in the hold , " Rokey asked , " instead of traveling as passengers ? " " We were seeking privacy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " Privacy in our world is difficult to find , and we had been through a stressful series of changes within the company . My family and I decided to sneak away for a rest , somewhere far away from everything . " The voice was eloquent , sadness ringing through the vibrant tones . " We thought a vacation on the fabled Moon of Desdemona might restore our sense of purpose . " " This ship has been in orbit here as a derelict for a decade and more , " Rokey said . " Why did it never make the news that all these people were missing ? " " I ca n't answer that , although we did go away in complete secrecy , " Idalia replied thoughtfully . " Only Captain Walters knew we were on board . We had this cargo hold prepared as an environmental chamber for us to travel in because we are only comfortable in low gravity . We came on board disguised as luggage . We wanted to keep our homeworld press from following us . We needed a rest-although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Is it normal for you to sleep that long ? " " Yes , but only under the right environmental conditions . We did not set the life-support controls in this chamber for the conditions in which you found us , and we were unable to control the conditions once we were locked inside . We had not planned to sleep during this journey , and we would never , under any circumstances , have allowed ourselves to fall asleep with humanoid aliens on the same ship with us ! " The emotional distress of that was clear . Idalia was not just embarrassed but was , for some reason , horrified that they had been made to fall so soundly asleep . Neither Ray nor Rokey pressed the issue . Idalia 's despair over their long sleep was growing . " I must explain all this to my family , " Idalia said . " I would ask you if it is possible for you to take us off this accursed ship , and return us to our homeworld , to Urk ? We would compensate you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ten days for us to get to the zip link station on Muriel and another three weeks for the link to Urk from there , " Rokey told him . " I think the Yankee Shadow can manage that , once we have fuel cells from the Narridge Hoad . " " Please , " Idalia said , his voice strange , " do not inform the people in this system that we were on board , " he said to them . Rokey could understand that , but had to ask , " Why trust us ? " " You were able to stand up to the noise . " Idalia 's words made no sense . " Not many have hearts and minds strong enough for that . " They did n't understand , but Ray and Rokey were glad to get off the Narridge Hoad and have an excuse to leave her behind . Even with the mysterious " haunting " ended , the ship resonated with the horror of tragic death and murder . The Urkaz , now that they were awake and aware of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and away from this system . They were afraid , and Ray and Rokey did not blame them . Even Ray felt sorry for them , once he had recovered himself from the fright . Transferring the treacle mass to the Yankee Shadow took some planning , however . In the null-g heart of the ship , they floated as large bubbles with eyes , but in a gravity field , they were flattened amoeboid crawlers , moving like flowing oil spills with eyes-fast crawlers , but it was a slow walking pace . Ray located a set of larger cargo-floaters and filled them to capacity with fuel cells and set off ahead , letting Rokey take the slower stroll escorting the alien executive and his family . Rokey also used a cargo-floater , with the treacle heads collected into the nullg field of the floater , cherry eyes shut tightly against the sight of the horrific landscape of their once-beautiful starship . Rokey felt the distinct lightness of heart that comes with the waking reality after a bad dream . The dead in their tidied remains no longer threatened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright light of day . Being free of the spacesuit added to his relief , but the dead silence of the starship was itself now a curious phenomenon , disquieting despite the peacefulness and hush . The terrible sonic assault had caused Ray and even himself some awkward emotional vulnerability , but how could it have caused the madness and death of the entire ship ? That same bit of information tried to float to his attention , almost making sense . There was something about low-end sonics and neurochemistry he had learned a long time ago in film-score classes and forgotten in the years of dealing with the realities of the film world and then the realities of the real world . " Our cruises run on laughter and music , ' " Rokey quoted a line from a familiar ad for the Bell Crystal luxury starliners . " Is that what you mean ? " Ray nodded . He had the galley 's main monitor tilted so that Rokey could see it from where he lay stretched out across the galley bench . Rokey was on his way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overload . It had calmed him down , but left him with some dreadful conclusions to ponder nonetheless . Ray pointed to a line of figures rising up gracefully across colored lines . " Magshielding locks everything inside , so when the ship is riding inside the Intraspace slip , nothing gets out-nothing . Sonic energy is absorbed as heat because it ca n't leak out anywhere . Luxonics systems in the ship 's hull turn that sonic energy into intra-ship communications . A ship ca n't run on laughter and music , but it does provide some energy , and they make a big deal out of that . But the point is that the ship is a closed universe inside those fields . " " Because Intraspace itself drives the engines that drive the fields , " Rokey added in the only solid fact he understood about Intraspace technology . " So the energy of that low-end sonic field , radiating out from the center of the ship , and already amplified by the antigrav interfaces , just kept feeding back on itself , creating standing waves of incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were in Intraspace . " Rokey felt a taste again of the terror on board the Hoad , the irrational grip of that massive non-sound . " At least while we were onboard , the energy could dissipate in heat radiation , yet it was still that bad . All those people , locked onboard , with absolutely no exit , and that terror growing and growing . " He shuddered , his hackles now free to rise even though lying down . While Ray was assembling data collected on board the Narridge Hoad into a more understandable picture of events , Rokey had done the research on sonics to find the answer that had nagged at him while walking through the haunted ship . He had found the answer at last , laid out in cold , clinical statistics , numbers on a screen attached to graphs that were a mockery of the ghostly faces , threatening presence , and overwhelming sense of wrongness that had pervaded the Hoad . Sonics twelve to fifteen cycles make the eyeball resonate , causing mistiness of vision and even hallucination ; at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hypothalamus is stimulated to release the chemistry of emotion , raw non-specific , adrenaline-driven emotion ; another produced auditory illusions , giddiness , dizziness , breathlessness , even blood pressure changes . But that was just textbook language that had nothing of the reality of fear and paranoia present in the actual experience of such rampant sound . The energy of the harmonics radiating from the hold had become fearsome standing waves , imperceptible but impossible to walk through unscathed . There had been no defense for the people on board during that terrible Intraspace crossing . The last one to die had obviously gone quite mad , scrawling that insane message above the dead . " We still do n't know where the sound came from , " Rokey said finally . " And we do n't know how the Urkaz got locked in there from the inside . " " We 're locked in here with them now , " Ray pointed out . He had turned from the screen and was looking down at Rokey 's upturned face . " You told them we 'd take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did that , did n't I ? " Rokey said . His expression showed his sudden discomfort at the thought . " Why did n't you point all this out before we jumped through the window for Urk ? We have jumped already , have n't we ? " " Where else were we going to take them ? To the Coast Guard ? " Rokey 's frown deepened . " l see what you mean . " He made himself sit up , pushing himself with both hands . " What was all that noise on the Hoad about ? " " And why did it stop ? " The Urkaz were staying in the cargo hold of the Yankee Shadow , not out of disrespect but because that section of the ship had the most elaborate antigravity control systems . The Urkaz preferred to float , having evolved in the low gravity field of a starship millennia ago . Ray and Rokey went below to the hold to talk to the Urkaz . " They let us fall asleep , " Idalia said . Anger trembled in his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we were forced into hibernation. , Shrillness made the gel of his body quiver as he spoke . " They let us fall asleep ! It is not our fault ! " " No one said it was , " Ray repeated calmly . " We just want to know what the noise was . Where did all that heavyduty low-end sound come from ? " " We have to protect ourselves , " Rokey added . " In order to protect you , we have to know what we 're up against . " " You must n't let us fall asleep again , " Idalia said urgently . The cherry eyes were wide , and his family had drawn close to him , almost melting together . " No matter what happens between now and our arrival at the window to Urk , you must make certain that we are awake ! " " It is our fault , " snapped a different , more shrill voice from somewhere in the gathered mass . " If we had been able to keep awake , nothing could have happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Urkaz who had spoken . " We are responsible for all that death , " she went on , floating a little above the mass of her family . " And that 's why we are running away now , running away and hiding . " Ray interrupted with a soothing tone that surprised even Rokey . " No one is running away from anything , ma'am . We are taking you back to your home system so that your own authorities can be brought in to investigate this , and to protect you . The Narridge Hoad is listed as vanished in transit " and her last official posting was a long , long way from where we found you . That means this was done to you , ma'am , not by you . We just do n't want to let it happen here , but we have to know what happened . Why is it so dangerous for you to fall asleep ? " There was a long pause in which the floating cherry eyes regarded one another silently , agreed with some gelled gesture , and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sleep , " Idalia said , eyes on his family and not the men as he spoke , " we have an instinctive defense mechanism that we can not shut off .
