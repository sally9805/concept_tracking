WINTER BEFORE LAST , a tea-leaf reader at a psychic fair looked into my cup and said she saw me living in a house with many beds and a big-mouth blonde . At the time it meant nothing to me . I was sharing a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan with a balding , malcontent boyfriend of twelve years , who said we 'd get married if I conceived his child or when he felt like it . Since I was looking for literary prophecies  --  that I 'd write a best-seller or at least find an agent  --  and because my tea-leaf reader wore , in a room full of gauzy peasantwear , a knock-off Chanel suit , I moved on to another booth . Six weeks later , Kenny took me out to dinner at an expensive chef-owned restaurant and told me he was ambivalent about us . I said what I 'd been saving for such an occasion  --  that we were commonlaw spouses by now and he 'd better get over his ambivalence . " I met someone , " he replied . There went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was married . So at forty-one , feeling like eighty , I was looking for something  --  a job , a friend , a hiding place where I could live out my days  --  when I overheard a stranger on the subway confide to her seatmate , " There are no guarantees in this world , but chances are that people who take out ads in the New York Review of Books are n't idiots or crooks . " I bought my first issue and read the personals for laughs , circling one or two that did n't ask for " pretty " or " vivacious " before my eyes wandered into " Share . " And there it was , my answer , my job , my tea-leaf destiny : Book in progress ? While you 're at it , why not share my Cape retreat ? Gourmet kitchen , beach rights , wild blueberries . Considering lap pool . Roomy and peaceful : your life will be your own . Write me about your spectacular self . Room and board negotiable in exchange for services . Include writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard between the lines , " Your troubles are over . Box 8152 will cure everything that 's been wrong with your life . " I could see myself , a better me , at this Cape retreat : at my typewriter , sharing thoughts and kitchen privileges with a kindred soul , baking wild blueberries into muffins . In the past , I would have signed up for a course on pouring my heart into a cover letter , but I figured even prophecies had expiring deadlines . I had to write the letter of my life , threading my frayed self through the eye of the employment needle into the Yes pile ; to find the silver lining in the fact that I 'd spent my thirties unofficially engaged to a spoiled child ; to put a good face on my B.A. in English from a defunct women 's college , my two unpublished novels , and a string of secretarial jobs where I had learned to clear the paper path in all makes of copying machines . So I wrote that for twelve years I had successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent , considerate , and neat . I sent a laser-printed chapter from my first novel , American Apology , along with its best rejection letter ( " competently written , at times even affecting " ) and a short story that my writing group insisted The New Yorker should have taken . Although dozens of people applied , people with Ph.D.s and hardcover contracts , it was my letter that Isabel Krug liked best . " I did n't want any big shots , " she told me later . " No prima donnas . You sounded normal . " She liked the " secretary " part . She wanted someone to ghostwrite her story , and she figured if it were a simple matter of channeling her voice through someone else 's fingertips , why not a blunt set that typed 105 words a minute ? Over the phone she asked without apology how old I was , if I 'd been in jail , if I had AIDS or the HIV virus , if I 'd be squeamish about male visitors , and if I drove a stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was offering what I needed . Assuming I had beat out the others on the strength of my prose and my suddenly spectacular self , I accepted ecstatically . Without meeting Isabel Krug . Without asking who else lived in this Cape retreat . Without asking what her story was .
