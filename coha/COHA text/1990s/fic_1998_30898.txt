Entry , the first , June 14 , 1830 Of all the things that drive men to sea , the most common disaster , I 've come to learn , is women . In my case , it was a spirited Boston schoolteacher named Isadora Bailey who led me to become a cook aboard the Republic . Both Isadora and my creditors , I should add , who entered into a conspiracy , a trap , a scheme so cunning that my only choices were prison , a brief stay in the stony oubliette of the Spanish Calabozo ( or a long one at the bottom of the Mississippi ) , or marriage , which was , for a man of my temperament , worse than imprisonment  --  especially if you knew Isadora . So I went to sea , sailing from Louisiana on April 14 , 1830 , hoping a quarter year aboard a slave clipper would give this relentless woman time to reconsider , and my bill collectors time to forget they 'd ever heard the name Rutherford Calhoun . But what lay ahead in Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , as I shall tell you , far worse than the fortune I 'd fled in New Orleans . New Orleans , you should know , was a city tailored to my taste for the excessive , exotic fringes of life , a world port of such extravagance in 1829 when I arrived from southern Illinois  --  a newly freed bondman , my papers in an old portmanteau , a gift from my master in Makanda  --  that I dropped my bags and a shock of recognition shot up my spine to my throat , rolling off my tongue in a whispered , " Here , Rutherford is home . " So it seemed those first few months to the country boy with cotton in his hair , a great whore of a city in her glory , a kind of glandular Golden Age . She was if not a town devoted to an almost religious pursuit of Sin , then at least to a steamy sexuality . To thenewcomer she was an assault of smells : molasses commingled with mangoes in the sensually damp air , the stench of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labyrinthine warehouses on the docks , the odor of Brazilian coffee and Mexican oils . And also this : the most exquisitely beautiful women in the world , thoroughbreds of pleasure created two centuries before by the French for their enjoyment . Mulattos colored like magnolia petals , quadroons with breasts big as melons  --  women who smelled like roses all year round . Home ? Brother , for a randy Illinois boy of two and twenty accustomed to cornfields , cow plops , and handjobs in his master 's hayloft , New Orleans was n't home . It was Heaven . But even paradise must have its back side too , and it is here ( alas ) that the newcomer comes to rest . Upstream there were waterfront saloons and dives , a black underworld of thieves , gamblers , and ne'er-do-wells who , unlike the Creoles downstream ( they sniffed down their long , Continental noses at poor , purebred Negroes like myself ) , did n't give a tinker 's damn about my family tree and welcomed me as the world downstream would not . In plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell into this life of living off others , of being a social parasite , is a long , sordid story best shortened for those who , like the Greeks , prefer to keep their violence offstage . Naturally , I looked for honest work . But arriving in the city , checking the saloons and Negro bars , I found nothing . So I stole  --  it came as second nature to me . My master , Reverend Peleg Chandler , had noticed this stickiness of my fingers when I was a child , and a tendency I had to tell preposterous lies for the hell of it ; he was convinced I was born to be hanged and did his damnedest to reeducate said fingers in finer pursuits such as good penmanship and playing the grand piano in his parlor . A Biblical scholar , he endlessly preached Old Testament virtues to me , and to this very day I remember his tedious disquisitions on Neoplatonism , the evils of nominalism , the genius of Aquinas , and the work of such seers as Jakob Bhme . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black saint like the South American priest Martn de Porres  --  or , for that matter , my brother Jackson . Yet , for all that theological background , I have always been drawn by nature to extremes . Since the hour of my manumission  --  a day of such gloom and depression that I must put off its telling for a while , if you 'll be patient with me  --  since that day , and what I can only call my older brother Jackson 's spineless behavior in the face of freedom , I have never been able to do things halfway , and I hungered  --  literally hungered  --  for life in all its shades and hues : I was hooked on sensation , you might say , a lecher for perception and the nerve-knocking thrill , like a shot of opium , of new " experiences . " And so , with the hateful , dull Illinois farm behind me , I drifted about New Orleans those first few months , pilfering food and picking money belts off tourists , but do n't be too quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 'm not stupid . Cityfolks lived by cheating and crime . Everyone knew this , everyone saw it , everyone talked ethics piously , then took payoffs under the table , tampered with the till , or fattened his purse by duping the poor . Shameless , you say ? Perhaps so . But had I not been a thief , I would not have met Isadora and shortly thereafter found myself literally at sea . Sometimes after working the hotels for visitors , or when I was drying out from whiskey or a piece of two-dollar tail , I would sneak off to the waterfront , and there , sitting on the rain-leached pier in heavy , liquescent air , in shimmering light so soft and opalescent that sunlight could not fully pierce the fine erotic mist , limpid and luminous at dusk , I would stare out to sea , envying the sailors riding out on merchantmen on the gift of good weather , wondering if there was some far-flung port , a foreign country or island far away at the earth 's rim where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediocrity they called achievement , the blatant selfishness they called individual freedom  --  all the bilge that made each day landside a kind of living death . I do n't know if you 've ever farmed in the Midwest , but if you have , you 'll know that southern Illinois has scale ; fields like sea swell ; soil so good that if you plant a stick , a year later a carriage will spring up in its place ; forests and woods as wild as they were before people lost their pioneer spirit and a healthy sense of awe . Only here , on the waterfront , could I recapture that feeling . Wind off the water was like a fist of fresh air , a cleansing blow that made me feel momentarily clean . In the spill of yellow moonlight , I 'd shuck off my boots and sink both feet into the water . But the pier was most beautiful , I think , in early morning , when sunlight struck the wood and made it steam as moisture and mist from the night before evaporated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the analogue for life was water , the formless , omnific sea . Businessmen with half a hundred duties barnacled to their lives came to stare , longingly , at boats trolling up to dock . Black men , free and slave , sat quietly on rocks coated with crustacea , in the odors of oil and fish , studying an evening sky as blue as the skin of heathen Lord Krishna . And Isadora Bailey came too , though for what reason I can not say  --  her expression on the pier was unreadable  --  since she was , as I soon learned , a woman grounded , physically and metaphysically , in the land . I 'd tipped closer to her , eyeing the beadpurse on her lap , then thought better of boosting it when I was ambushed by the innocence  --  the alarming trust  --  in her eyes when she looked up at me . I wondered , and wonder still : What 's a nice girl like her doing in a city like this ? She was , in fact , as out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orgy with de Sade : a frugal , quiet , devoutly Christian girl , I learned , the fourth daughter of a large Boston family free since the Revolutionary War , and positively ill with eastern culture .
