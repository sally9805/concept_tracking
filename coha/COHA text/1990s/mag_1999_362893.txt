NICE JOBS , STEVE Thanks for the great article on Steve Jobs and the resurgence of Apple Computer COVER STORIES , Oct. 18 . While Bill Gates has been in the news lately for his hardball tactics in promoting Microsoft 's products , Jobs is making headlines because his company makes products people want to use . " Think Different , " indeed ! ANDRE FERRER Seattle <P> The difference between Jobs and Gates is as striking as that between Apple 's stunning , colorful iMacs and the standard beige Windows eyesores kludging up desktop space worldwide . Gates seems to view new technology as either a threat to his company or an opportunity to make more money and gain even more control of the market . Jobs responds to new technology by dreaming up ways to make it available to ordinary people like me . MATTHEW CECIL Iowa City <P> Unfortunately , much of what has been published about Jobs is unflattering and sometimes almost slanderous . There is a fine line between genius and madness , and Steve Jobs has been on the balance beam since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to achieve greatness without taking gambles , some of which fail while others revolutionize the industry ( e.g. , iMac and the new G4 ) . While Jobs ' methods may not be popular , they are most effective . Everyone in the world knows the name Gates . It 's unfortunate that Jobs , the true founder of Silicon Valley and the personal computer , is not given the same recognition . TERRI GERGELY Coaldale , Alta . <P> The new iMacs are beautiful ! I am a college student ready to graduate and purchase a new computer , and I do n't even want to think about buying a beige Wintel box . However , the Macintosh platform is still not as universally supported as are PCs , and this puts users at a disadvantage . Apple may be turning a profit and churning out the most dramatic designs in the computer industry , but until more software is written for the Macintosh platform , my money will be going elsewhere . JONATHAN FLESHER Gainesville , Fla . <P> The longtime complaint that there is n't much software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a misunderstanding of quality vs. quantity . There does n't have to be a lot of software if the software is good . I trust that the Macintosh market share will grow so that the industry is not forever slowed down by the anchor that 's holding back innovation . For now , I 'm content that the Mac may not be the computer for everyone . After all , not everyone drives a Mercedes or a Rolls . JOYCE RUDOWSKI Cincinnati , Ohio <P> A lot of people here in Silicon Valley think Jobs is an arrogant ass . I do n't really care . Every time I fire up my beautiful new Power Mac G4 computer , I thank God and Steve for saving me from the awful alternative . DARRELL GORR San Jose , Calif . <P> WHAT TED HAS TO SAY <P> TIME should be commended for providing us with rare insight into the mind of a killer NATION , Oct. 18 . Unabomber Ted Kaczynski is an unrepentant murderer who deserves the life sentence that was given to him . Perhaps being in prison for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain and agony he has inflicted . MIGUEL NOE DEJESUS RODRIGUEZ Chicago <P> You gave that criminal , that murdering lunatic Kaczynski , the very thing he wanted  --  recognition before a forum of millions . What an appalling editorial decision . Shame on you . EVE BELSON FUDGE Corona del Mar , Calif.
