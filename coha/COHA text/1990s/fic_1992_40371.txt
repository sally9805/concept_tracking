Politics and adultery : A legend in the future tense <p> " My dear , " murmured the President 's spouse to the President , as they lay together upon the marital bed in the White House and the laser beams of the twenty-four-hour Washington son et lumiere danced upon the wall and flickered across their faces and made sleep unlikely , " there was a long red hair curled upon your collar at church today . Whose was it ? " <p> And it could have been anytime , any century , any presidential couple ; it could have been Jackie speaking to her Jack , or Eleanor to her Frankie , except that it just so happened that the year was 2012 and the President was a woman . Outside , the susurrus of the crowd rose and fell , as it did in its comforting fashion night and day , 365 days a year and one extra in leap years , the whisper of we worship you and have pity on us mixed . Usually it lulled the President and her spouse to sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight there seemed a threat in it . We 'll get you yet ! <p> The President 's hair was dark and short , and that of her spouse  --  he was Vice President as well  --  long and fair , so the red did need some explanation . The President thought a little before she spoke . It might have been Jane Fonda lying there , or Roseanne , for who is to say what plastic surgery and youth enhancement ca n't do to a woman , so let us call her Roseanda ; and by her side her spouse , a gentle , graceful man who might have been Arnold Schwarzenegger or Harrison Ford a few years on , plus a hormone or so , but let us call him Schwarzison . Roseanda and her Schwarzison , who loved each other , or tried to , only politics got in their way . <p> " The wind must have blown it there , " Roseanda finally answered . " Do n't upset yourself . " <p> " I do not blame you , my dear , " said Schwarzison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his , " but you have been unfaithful to me , to use the old term . You have committed adultery , and with , I have no doubt , a member of the Presidential Guard , whose first duty is to the presidency and whose second is to celibacy . " <p> " Alas , my dear , " said Roseanda , " it turns out that these duties are in conflict . You know how it is . Utopia is full of paradox : heal one ill and cause another . On this philosophy , it seems , however unknowingly , was our brave new nation founded . " <p> " So you admit a liaison , " murmured Schwarzison . " I find that noble in you . You never lie . But I also find myself a little hurt . And supposing someone finds out ? " <p> " I was very careful , " said Roseanda , " and I thought about you all the time I was with him because I love you , but the pressures upon the President are great and must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Bush jogged ? " <p> " Supposing you get pregnant ? " asked Schwarzison . " What then ? " <p> " Albert , Queen Victoria 's husband , " said Roseanda dreamily , " was not the son of the Duke but of his mother the Duchess 's lover , a stable groom . All the royalty in England is descended from that man who shoveled shit . " <p> " Found a dynasty ! " exclaimed Schwarzison . " Is that your purpose ? The President of Utopia is not a hereditary title , at least not yet . Though the way things are going , nothing would surprise me . " <p> " Why not ? " asked Roseanda . " Had it not been for Chappaquiddick and Palm Beach , we would have had one . " <p> And they curled their limbs warmly around each other and breathed affection each in the other 's ear , but nothing more . <p> Now the future takes so many twists and unexpected turns  --  who in 1989 could have conceived of 1992 ?  --  that perhaps I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Schwarzison that night in 2012 , only twenty years from now . For the seeds of the future lie in the present ; and if fertilized by Riot and watered by the tears of Media , how fast and luxuriously those seeds can grow ! <p> And the story of that wondrous growth could be heard on the tapes of the Washington son et lumiere , the sound of which  --  though rather distorted by the snap , crackle , and pop of electrical interference  --  drifted through the White House night after summer night , as the laser beams played upon its walls . This is how it went : <p> During the course of the 1996 presidential campaign all male candidates were exposed as either faithless husbands , fornicators , depressives , philanderers , drug-takers , or guilty of sexual harassment at some time or other in their past ; and every single one of the uprush of female candidates , too old and unphotogenic to gain popular acceptance . The electorate responded by refusing to go to the polls at all ; a constitutional crisis arose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the voters ' cry , " or give us no one . " To misquote Tennyson , as did Dan Quayle , President-in-Effect as a result of the crisis , in a famous TV broadcast around that time : <p> We have had enough of fooling , And of voting , we Rolled to leftward , rolled to rightward While the sperm was surging free ... <p> The electorate had discovered that the power of moral disapproval was about the only power they had left to control an increasingly remote administration  --  and now that they had their teeth in , they would n't let go . <p> How they disapproved ! What the electorate had come to require from all candidates for public office , and not merely for the presidency , was , in men , persons of low sexual drive combined with mental and moral energy and , in women , persons of instant decision who were also pretty , sweet , and married . And they would have such people , or they would be on a permanent vote-strike . And then where would democracy be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quayle , in conjunction with an extreme feminist lobby , who hit upon the solution . Estrogen , the female sex hormone , was to be put into the nation 's drinking water . Just as fluoride had for years been added to the water to protect the teeth of the populace from decay , so estrogen was to protect the United States from sexual pollution . Estrogen would make men softer , kinder , sweeter , and would lessen their libido while not affecting their administrative capabilities in the least ; women would remain attractive , receptive , and nurturing even when older and well practiced in the arts and skills of government . <p> There were , of course , public-health implications that argued both for and against the measure , but California , " The Estrogen State ! " took the plunge . Other states quickly followed as it became apparent that not only were suitable candidates for political and public office beginning to come forward but many other social benefits were being achieved by the cheap and simple expedient of " Water Enhancement , " as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Birthrates fell below replacement level , as the macho was taken out of men and female fertility rates lessened . At the same time , the mortality rate from stroke and heart failure , especially among older women , increased dramatically , and the burden on the narrow earning-band of the population was much lightened as a consequence . Even as the nation grieved for its dead , it cheered up . What use are the old anyway ? Women in particular just raised the national bill for Medicare by living too long . Everyone knew it . No one liked to say it . <p> Men rather enjoyed their new plump and waisted figures ; their preoccupations turned from weaponry toward fashion ; the nation disarmed  --  with no protest from the Pentagon generals , for they , too , were content  --  and returned to the productive prosperity it had known in the past . Recession was over . With a rapidly decreasing , more prosperous , and less aggressive population , many of the graver problems which had faced society at the turn of the century disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illiteracy became things of the past . Crime rates fell as the gun lobby fell silent and gave up , surprised by the new softness of its own voice ; understanding at last that only those who wish to attack fear attack , that only the violent of heart need to be eloquent in the name of self-defense . Hugh Hefner , speaking from the grave through one of the new Sony sensors , assured the American male that " to cuddle is cozy ; to penetrate is to perpetrate . " There was some regret that he chose to speak through a Sony rather than an AT &T; sensor , but perhaps Mr. Hefner was unaware of the threat posed by Japan in the area of new after-death thought-technology . The United States had developed the technology first but , alas , had lacked the aggression to follow its notable achievement through with a worldwide sales push . <p> All these were side issues , of course  --  the main function of the Water Enhancement Policy was to provide a race of public servants with total sexual integrity and eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who could chop down a cherry tree and not feel obliged to lie about it . But there was a great deal of ground to be regained . <p> At the beginning of the 1990s the country had been in a sorry state and statistics proved it . Something had to happen ! Just think of it  --  550,000 porno videocassettes rented every day , $9.5 million a year spent promoting teenage celibacy , 14 condoms used every single second ( " fast but furious " being apparently the nation 's motto , the average duration of sexual intercourse for citizens at that time being just ten minutes ) . Twenty percent of men earning more than $50,000 a year claimed to have had at least six affairs with co-workers , and if they earned over $70,000 , why , there was a 70 percent chance they had already cheated on their wives ! All this changed within the decade , thanks to the Water Enhancement Policy . Sex , when it took place at all , became a languorous affair and mostly confined to the marital bed . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potency required to commit adultery ? To penetrate is to perpetrate  --  but to cuddle is cozy ! The nation , finally relieved of the burden of its own hypocrisy , its fear of sex , rejoiced ! <p> It became apparent , nevertheless , that there would be a gap of some years before the new Good-from-the-beginning People 's Hero could emerge , and so on the first day of the new century an electoral amnesty was declared ; the media ordained that details of misdemeanors , whether sexual , psychiatric , or any other , committed in the twentieth century would remain unpublished . That was the day , too , when the United States of America changed its name to the Utopian States of America . There was even a movement , strong in California , to change the Stars and Stripes to a silver flag with thirty-one orange ovals on it  --  representative of those silver foil sheets of birth-control pills women used to carry in their handbags in the old days before implants  --  but this was successfully resisted , in the name of national continuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sense , the amalgamation and/or secession of a number of the Federal States . <p> Outside the White House , the voices of the son et lumiere faded while the " History of the Nation " tape was changed to " The Nation at Prayer , " but the laser beams still played . <p> " It 's like living in a goldfish bowl up here , " complained the President , as many a President had complained before . For Roseanda to complain was rare , and for a moment Schwarzison wondered if she had had access to non-enhanced water . <p> Now , of all Americans only the men of the Presidential Guard were permitted to drink bottled water , specially imported for them from Europe , the better to guard the President of the Utopian States , being quicker on the draw , more alert to danger than other males . They were tall , noble men of high intelligence and good education . Their senior officer , Max , thirty-two , was redheaded , freckled , charming , and potent , as Schwarzison no longer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , so there was no shame in it . Do not imagine a conspiracy : that the Guard existed to provide a satisfactory gene pool for future generations . The science of genetic engineering no longer required living donors ; it had more than it needed in deep freeze . No , they existed simply to look after the welfare of the President and because they looked superb at ceremonies and were the new superstars who could get the electorate back to the polls should the need ever arise again . Forewarned is forearmed , and vigilance in the defense of democracy is always required . " The right candidate for the right voter ! " that was the motto of Utopia . <p> " You 're not , my dear , you 're not in love with Max ? " asked Schwarzison of Roseanda . " I could n't bear it . " <p> " I 'm not , " she said , " and yet , you know , the plot flows that way and it is our duty to go where the plot leads . Is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , not to avoid them ? And surely you , as Vice President , are the head of the Church and must take its tenets seriously . " <p> " To hell with the Church , " said Schwarzison , with as much aggression as he could muster . " I 'm hurting inside . " <p> The sound of the son et lumiere swelled again : music , voices , prayers extolling the new religion of Utopia . The Great New Fictional Religion , or GNFR , had swept the country at the turn of the century ; the then President-in-Effect Dan Quayle being its first convert , the nation following his example , just as the whole Roman Empire had been converted to Christianity along with the Emperor Constantine , just twenty-one centuries earlier . What the Head of State believes , the people believe . <p> The people never change . Their voices outrun the centuries . We worship you , they say . Have pity on us . Careful or we 'll get you ! The people play along  --  so far , no farther . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the proletariat , flatter them with " electorate , " call them what you will . Give them bread and circuses ; give them religion ; give them something , even estrogen in the water , but give them something or they 'll get you ! Give them religion , that 's best of all . Decipher the story , as the " Nation at Prayer " tape crackles and swells : <p> The GNFR , and its Deity , the GSWITS , the Great Screenwriter in the Sky , was what attracted the religious fervor of our former President-in-Effect . It is a powerful , meaningful , and relevant religion . Its God , the GSWITS , is a B-movie writer allocated to Planet Earth : something of a hack , in fact , whose habit it is to write in a disaster , an earthquake , a nuclear explosion , a tidal wave , a recession , or a home repossession whenever He could n't properly resolve a story . Other , better writers control other , better worlds ; we are landed with this one , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GSWITS to improve His writing and so avoid disaster . Their efforts on Earth must be to further the plot , to go with the flow of events , not resist them . If the poor would only assent to being bit-part players in the lives of the rich , comedy walk-ons , much social unrest would be saved . All would live in greater contentment . <p> Just as in Christianity ( for a time at least ) the poor and humble were placated by the prospect of heaven , so in the GNFR they were offered representation on L.A. Law or Cheers and were gratified . The development of sensors which could pick up the residual thought waves of the dead from the grave and translate them onto tape did much to assist the popularity of the new religion . The GSWITS , it seemed , was finally getting around to revealing the end of the many exciting stories He had never satisfactorily finished : Oswald spoke from the grave to affirm he was the solo assassin , Maxwell and Mengele were able to confirm they were indeed defunct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly in his head , composing new hits which were not quite as good as those he sang when alive . That the ending of the story usually disappointed  --  though Marilyn 's death turned out to be more scandalous than anyone had dreamed  --  merely made the religious pray harder that the GSWITS would do better next time . The GNFR , in fact , finally diverted the citizens ' attention from the news to the comedy shows , from politics to the movies . The real world became less than real ; the world of fiction , divine . The edited word  --  for what is fiction but life experience pushed into meaningful shape and with all the boring bits edited out ?  --  became to the real world as waking is to sleep , instead of the other way around . <p> By 2012 , thanks to a combination of Water Enhancement and the GNFR , the population had forgotten about sex altogether , and moviegoing , rather than adultery , was the focal point around which their political decisions were made . <p> To have enjoyed Batman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more relevance to the electorate than subtleties of housing policy , social welfare , disarmament , or whatever , and was at least a matter which the people were equipped to judge . It was at the height of the GNFR , and after the amnesty , that Roseanda and Schwarzison swept to victory at the polls  --  she as President , he as her running mate  --  and Dan Quayle tottered off into the sunset . He had done a fine job . Roseanda and Schwarzison 's wedding , six weeks before the Inauguration , was reckoned to have been viewed by 99.9 percent of the population . Even strong men , though there were few strong men left , and they mostly in the Presidential Guard , wept . <p> " Is Max the one ? " asked Schwarzison now . " The only one who did n't cry at our wedding ? You remarked upon it at the time . You must share this with me , my dear . " <p> " Yes , " said Roseanda , President of the Utopian States , " Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man hard , eager , and purposeful . A man who lusts and does not love . A man who lures his Chief of State into adultery to further his political ambition . " <p> Roseanda was no fool , despite her body being so estrogen-enriched , though rather less so than usual , inasmuch as Max and she shared a good deal of imported bottled water together , as well as sex , on their frequent assignations , and into this water they would crumble the illegal steroids which made him so muscular and energetic . <p> " I do n't know what to do , " said Schwarzison , and a tear crept down his cheek and Roseanda observed it , glittering in the laser beams which played upon the walls and reflected back upon their beautiful faces . <p> " My dear , " said Roseanda , " you must do as the GSWITS suggests : You must go with the flow , you must do as the plot suggests ; in other words , you must go . " <p> And Schwarzison crept obediently from the presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's back to ' The King must die , ' I suppose . King for a year and then kapow , for the sake of the harvest . " <p> " The people require a sacrifice , " said Roseanda , in her new stern and queenly voice . " Always have and always will . " <p> Within a week Schwarzison had , perforce , taken up an appointment as Ambassador to Nigeria , and Max , to the tumultuous and relieved applause of the populace , lay beside Roseanda in the presidential bed . The heredity principle of the presidency was declared , the Water Enhancement Policy was canceled by the President out of consideration for other women , the Utopian States became once more the United States , and America got back to business . Albeit , in the words of former President Bush , as a kinder and gentler nation . <p> Fay Weldon 's latest novel , Life Force , was published recently by Viking Penguin . <p>                  @ @ @
