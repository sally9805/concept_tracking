<p> No matter what kind of Federal budget finally comes out of the unseemly scramble that has so demeaned Congress and the White House in recent weeks , a long-suffering public is more likely to remember the process than the product . Seldom , if ever , has Washington looked more self-serving and less effective . <p> There 's plenty of blame and ridicule to go around , but on first analysis , the big loser - certainly of what he once called Big Mo - seems to be George Bush . But the President has lost a good deal more than the political " momentum " he had earned from his adept mobilization of the collective-security effort against Saddam Hussein in the Middle East . <p> Most obviously , Mr. Bush 's overall approval rating dropped meteorically , from a nearly incredible 76 percent in August to 60 percent last week , in the continuing New York Times/CBS News Poll . That 's still pretty good , but it was a new low for the Bush Presidency . Worse , on specific questions , the President got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the economy , 58 percent opposed his conduct in the budget debacle and 46 percent criticized his savings-and-loan " rescue . " <p> Less demonstrably but not less plausibly , the President 's bob-and-weave performance in budget negotiations with the Democrats combined disastrously with his earlier abandonment of his " no new taxes " pledge . Together , they undermined the public belief that Republicans , and Mr. Bush personally , were more responsible and reliable than Democrats in fiscal matters . <p> The one point on which the President and his aides seemed most nearly adamant , moreover , was their resistance to an income-tax increase on the rich - even as the President kept insisting on a capital-gains tax break for the same rich . Mr. Bush was willing , however , to accept a gasoline tax and " sin taxes " on whisky , beer and cigarettes - all of which bear down hardest on the poor and middle class . <p> Never mind that Democratic negotiators accepted these levies , too . It was the President who was threatening to veto anything else , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wealthy - even pushing a bill explicitly designed for that purpose through the House . The net result may be that blue-collar and ethnic groups that voted Republican in the 80 's - Ronald Reagan 's greatest gift to his party - will come to the predictable conclusion of Ron Brown , the Democratic national chairman : " The Republican Party favors the wealthy and the Democratic Party favors the average American . " <p> Beginning with his abandonment of the no-new-taxes pledge , and continuing through the ups and downs of the budget negotiations , Mr. Bush 's performance also displeased the Republican right wing . The President failed either to take a hard-right ideological stand , or to provide tough leadership for whatever position he did take at any given moment - which was sometimes hard to tell without an interpreter of Bushspeak . <p> A modern Republican President can ill afford to offend his right wing , which dominates Republican national conventions and ideological debate within the party , and is seldom willing to lower its voice in the interests of party unity . At least in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even have resurrected the wimp 's reputation that he and Willie Horton , with the aid of bloodshed in Panama , had so nearly buried . <p> Even Mr. Bush 's respect for the " vision thing , " never much in evidence , must have seemed to many onlookers less compelling than usual . A President presumably should have a sense of where he wants to take the country , in economic as well as other terms . Mr. Bush appeared , instead , to have no central conviction for which he was willing to fight ( other than the capital-gains tax break ) , and to be more concerned about escaping blame than asserting leadership . As such caution often dictates , he managed neither . <p> The nation may be the winner in one respect . Polls also show declining approval of the U.S. military presence on the Saudi Arabian border . Either from second thoughts about Operation Desert Shield or declining confidence in Mr. Bush 's general leadership , support for his handling of the Middle East crisis already has plunged from 76 to 57 percent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for an actual war in the desert , either to liberate Kuwait or to bring down Saddam Hussein . For that reason , Mr. Bush may think long and hard , and more than twice , about taking the nation into such a war - probably without allies in the region and with too little enthusiasm at home .
