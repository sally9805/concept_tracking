Whether he 's railing at his stand-up audience , hosting dignitaries on TV , cranking out hip commercials or dodging bullets in the movies , Chris Rock has the last laugh // FACE IT . Black folks have n't had much to laugh about these days . The winds that howled out of a conservative White House in the 1980 's have eroded hard-fought social and political strides made just a generation ago . Economic upheavals have siphoned off jol ) s fiom the inner cities while legions of Black farmers have lost their land . A triple  --  hea ( led serpent of crack cocaline , lethal violence and AIDS has slithered through our communities , leaVig scars as deep and painful as the slaver 's whip . Yet throughout it all , the turmoil and the triumphs too , Black people have never lost their sense of humor . We laugh a distinctively honest laughter ; a **31;745;TOOLONG - lean- way- back laughter ; a knowing laughter mixed with that **28;778;TOOLONG kind , a bittersweet response thalt Langston Hughes once described as our " unconscious therapy , " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been Chris Rock . The 33-year-old boy-size comedian witlh the goatee-framed goofy grin , the skinny guy with the high , raspy voice who sounds as if he 's shouting even when he is n't has been letting loose with a wit so quick and sharp that it practically drips with insight and savage sarcasm . For Rock , who 's also an actor ; an author a talk-show host and a pitchman , the sweetest sound is laughter-riotous laughter ; if he can elicit it-at the verbal spitballs he aims at what he views as social , political and racial conventions . This is the man who once said onstage tthat the reason jails are overcrowded in America is that with more people brokeand starving , life is catching up to jail . If you live in an old project , a new jail ai n't that bad . " &gt; This is the man who questioned how Marion Barry could win reelection as Washington , D.C. 's mayor after being convicted for smoking crack cocaine . " Now c'm on now , how are they going to tell little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack ? " Rock asked rhetorically . " Do n't get high , you wo n't be nothing . ' " I can be mayor . " " Photograph // This is the man who derided community colleges because , he quipped , " anybody in the community can go : a crack head , a prostitute , a drug dealer . " And with each perfectly timed comic phrase , with each deliciously mischievous insight , Rock , the former high-school nerd , was bathed in laughter . He draws laughter from increasingly larger and varied audiences like a force of nature , the way freshly sliced onions draw involuntary tears . For Rock , being before the cameras , being onstage , is like being in international waters . " You can do anything in international waters , " he recently mused . Making a Joke and Making a Point " I 'm a big man onstage , " he says . There he uses the N word and other swear words you would n't have heard in the Brooklyn storefront church where his grandfather preached when Rock was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about making a joke and making a point , he says . And with his in-your-face style he has certainly been making a lot of both ( not to mention money ) lately . He also knowingly skates , with varying degrees of success , the seam that separates the fabric of a Black man 's social consciousness from that of a calculating , well-paid professional clown . Rock took some tough questions about posing last fall for the cover of Rolling Stone , where his neck was computerenhanced to appear impossibly stretched by a vaudevillelike hook yanking him offstage . For some , his elongated neck was reminiscent of those of lynching victims in the Old South . More recently , he came under fire for posing as a hayseed clown with exaggerated greasepainted lips on the cover of Vanity Fair . There were those who thought he looked painfully like something out of a coon show . In both instances , Rock 's defense was his proclamation that he is a comedian . " You just want to try to be funny , " he said , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end , he said , he was tired of some Blacks , particularly " so-called intellectuals , " who ca n't take a joke . " The Guy 's a Genius " Defiant , and perhaps even a bit arrogant , Rock rolls on , speaking his mind and getting his laughs . In a rapid-fire routine for Comic Relief 8 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City , Rock told a largely White audience that he understood why President Clinton might lie under oath about his sex life . " What do you fear more ? " Rock asked as he paced the stage like a starving alley cat . " A God you cant see or a wife you can ? That 's the real deal . God do n't make you sleep on the couch . " He stomped off the stage leaving a swirl of laughter and applause in his wake . He was pumped . He was hot . " I 'm just trying not to be boring , man , " he confessed shortly before his performance . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the **27;808;TOOLONG entertainer has used that " act " to transform himself from Chris What ? to Chris Wow ! One critic has called him " probably the funniest and smartest comedian working today " ; another , " the best stand-up comedian today . " " The guy 's a genius , " says Hamilton Cloud , the executive producer of the NAACP Image Awards shows in Los Angeles . Cloud recalled how impressed he was with Rock when he first saw the young comic perform as he toiled in near obscurity about ten years ago . " I could n't believe how politically insightful he was and how sharp he was during a time when Black comedians were n't doing a lot of political stuff . The kid was up to speed on everything . " But then , Cloud says , he noticed that for years Rock was not catching on . " I was thinking to myself , " he says , " maybe he was too cutting-edge . " Now with the tough times at his back , practically all of America has been poked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say is his fearlessness in squeezing humor out of pain , even racial pain . For instance , still smarting over White criticism of the mostly Black jury for acquitting O.J. Simpson of double homicide , Rock took up the issue . During the taping of his two-time Emmy Award-winning HBO special Bring the Pain two years ago , he said Whites would have done the same thing if the accused had been a White celebrity . " Because if that was Jerry Seinfeld charged with double murder and the only person that found the glove just happened to be in the Nation of Islam , Jerry 'd be a free man . " Photograph // Little of This , a Little of That Today it seems Rock 's act is as ubiquitous as the weather . He has written a book , Rock This ! ( Hyperion , $19.95 ) , made television commercials ( he 's the voice and soul of Nike 's Li'l Penny ) and hosted the MTV Video Music Awards . Now he 's trying to take his comedy , as he puts it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in several mainstream Hollywood movies , including Lethal Weapon 4 and next year 's Dogma , and has stolen more scenes than should be legal . He 's writing a romantic comedy for Paramount Pictures , sharing that task with Marshall Brickman , the cowriter on some of Woody Allen 's most successful films . He returned this summer to his critically acclaimed weekly talk show , The Chris Rock Show on HBO , which is so hard-hitting that the studio audience should be outfitted with air bags . Plus , he says , he is preparing to do some stand-up comedy and record a follow-up to his Grammynominated comedy CD , Roll With the New . A new HBO special may also be in the works , he says . Sinbad , the comedian , who has traveled a career path similar to Rock 's , said in a recent interview that it is clearly Chris Rock 's time . " He 's always been funny , always been funny , " Sinbad said . " He has n't changed . It 's just that now people know he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Rock squirms at the suggestion that he has made it . " There 's money , but it 's quick and life is long . " Seated snugly behind a large , round table in the dimly lit Coffee Shop cafe in New York City recently , he appears even more uncomfortable when he tries to explain the wave of acclaim that 's been washing over him in recent years . " I do n't know ... the stars are in the right place , " he says , clearing his throat . " You know what they always say , Preparation meets opportunity , that 's luck . ' You work hard and long enough and some good things will happen . " Perfect Timing or Sheer Perfection ? " You know what 's weird ? In show business , when your age group gets in power and you 're ready , that 's when things will happen , " he says . " So like I 'm 33 and there are studio heads that are like 35 , people running magazines are like under 40 . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're saying , " I used to watch him on Saturday Night Live . I loved him in I 'm Gon na Git You Sucka ten years ago . ' " He laughs , an honest Black laugh . He laughs as if the joke is on him , yet it tickles him nonetheless . " In the last couple of years , it 's like I talk to Eddie , I talk to Damon or Keenan or something , " Rock says , adding that he talks to Bill Cosby , he knows Dick Gregory . " It 's like I 'm at the table now , I do n't have to sit at the little table anymore . I feel I 'm at the grown folks ' table . " In private , Rock ratchets down his stage persona . His voice is softer , his words come more haltingly and are far less sharply edged . There is a shyness about him , even when he harmlessly flirts with a waitress , who could pass as a Jennifer Lopez body double , about the menu 's offerings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking his eyes from her . " Yes , we have ... " Rock cuts off the waitress to complete his question . " ... besides you ? " He chuckles . Hey-hey-hey . Comedian . She chuckles back and takes his order , a Caesar salad and a no-frills platter of fish and chips . Regular Guy , Give or Take a Few Mil Rock is a regular at the cafe . He has a special table in the front by a window . People tend to give him his space there . Few gawk as he unwinds with his meal . Between bites he talks , sometimes easily , sometimes not , about almost any subject . Decidedly un-Hollywood , Rock says he does n't go in for the star trips . He seldom travels with security people . He slipped into the cafe alone , no entourage of publicists or eager gofers in tow . It 's just Chris Rock dressed so off-the-shelf casual-noname jeans , dark buttoned-down shirt revealing a white T-shirt at his open collar-that he could have been mistaken for one of the cafe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift . Rock is not fond of pretense . He lives in a comfortable brownstone in Brooklyn not far from the house in the working-class Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood where he grew up the third oldest of Julius and Rose Rock 's seven children . He laughs , . though , at a persistent rumor circulating among his fans that he actually lives in the same Bed-Stuy house he was reared in . " I 'm not trying to keep it that real , " he says with that toothy trademark grin . The core of his humor is hyperhonesty . Achieving that kind of honesty as a performer is no easy trick , he says . He often incorporates his own travails into his act-his years as a horny single man , his bad telephone sex , his frustrations with some of the destructive things " niggers " do . But achieving a similar kind of take-no-prisoners honesty is especially hard for women comics , Rock says . Why ? Mostly because , he says , they 're women . The Thing With Women Is ... " The whole idea of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he explains . " You know , women wear makeup . They wear makeup and they wear heels . They 're not themselves . " Now , Rock readily admits , there are some exceptions to the rule . Whoopi Goldberg and Ellen DeGeneres , to name a couple , are " hysterical , " he says . But for the most part , the " facade " that most women by their nature erect is a barrier to getting close enough to audiences to get the really big laughs . " You got to be right here , " Rock says , holding his open palm against his nose . " Women have a mystique-all womenand comedians ca n't have a mystique . " Richard Pryor , one of his idols , does not have a mystique , he notes . " He 's a legendary figure , and there is a legend that travels with him , " Rock says . " But there ai n't nothing we do n't know about him . " And there are some women comedians-and he does n't name names-who " just get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to just talk dirty . That , " he says , " ai n't really the whole thing . " And Then There 's Sex As for Rock himself , two of his favorite targets for comedy are sex and relationships . " Everyone deals with that , " says Rock , who married public-relations executive Malaak Compton-Rock two years ago . " I think the women stuff in my act sells the tickets . " While packaged in contemporary language and circumstances , the humor is age-old . In fact , he says , " I do n't write the jokes . Everybody writes the jokes . The jokes are out there . I 'm just out there sucking it up like a Hoover . " For example , he says he thinks it is funny , and true , that men achieve only to impress women . Everything from the erecting of the Empire State Building to the launching of the space shuttle is some kind of male mating ritual , he says . " It 's just an elaborate plan to get laid , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men can usually afford their own needs but never the insatiable needs of the women in their lives . " They want so much more than us , " he says . " That 's why we work so hard . It would be simple if we got women and they wanted the same stuff we did . That would be easy . One job , and life would be done . " They want so much more than what you will ever get , than you could ever get , no matter who you are , " he continues . Well , he thinks that Bill Gates , the computer-software billionaire , might be an exception to his rule , but not himself " I feel broke , " he deadpans , without further explanation . About marriage in general , Rock once joked that " marriage is the roughest thing in the world . Nelson Mandela endured almost 27 years in a South African prison , but once he got out , it only took two years before his marriage busted his ass . " He bristles at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his audiences that are predominantly women . " The risk is not being funny , " he says . " Risky is being whack . " Similarly , he downplays his reputation for fearlessness , like his comic assaults on Marion Barry . " Fearless to me is like spitting on Mike Tyson-that 's fearless , " Rock says . " I mean , what I 'm doingI 'm just trying to be funny . " What 's Off-limits There are some places the comic seems reluctant to go , even for a joke . He seldom says much about interracial relationships or the assault on affirmative action , the multiracial campaign for selfidentity or even the state of Black leadership ( besides occasional verbal jabs at Barry ) . " I only know everybody who gets really big gets shot in the head , " Rock ventures . " I 'm sure that has deterred a few qualified brothers from stepping up to the mike . " He says he 's not meant to solve the world 's problems . " I 'm not any more political than , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding that " I 'm just interpreting and putting a little comic spin on it . " His banter comes to a dead stop when he 's asked whether his wife shares his views on life and love . He says he does n't want to talk about his family . " They 're not in show business , " he explains matter-of-factly . " I am . " Rock met his wife when he was becoming a famous face ; she was a pretty one . In his own brand of celebrity calculus , fame and any woman 's beauty amount to about the same thing . " A fine woman is a celebrity , " he elaborates . " Fine women get in everyplace . People look at them , always hassling them . " My being famous is just like being a fine woman , " Rock says with a straight face . " The only difference is that I got some money . He says his wife is also independently successful , noting that " she has her own thing " with her career . Good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother a house recently in Myrtle Beach , South Carolina ( his father died in 1988 of complications of a chronic ulcer ) - maintains that he has a " flimsy-ass job . " The entertainment industry , he rails , is shaky . " I ca n't believe I 'm still in this business , " Rock says . Whenever relatives approach him for jobs , he says , he lectures them about the fickle entertainment business and offers instead to pay their way through college . " I want to help you be in a position where maybe I can get a job from you , " he says he tells them . Still Adjusting to Notoriety Offstage , Rock can appear oddly awkward , ill at ease . At a Grammy party a couple of years ago at the Plaza Hotel in New York City , he was met by a storm of paparazzi . As he made his way into the gala , his smile was stiff and his speech was little more than unintelligible whispers . Some months earlier , Rock , who was attending a benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Formerly Known as Prince , was invited to the stage by the rocker . Again he seemed to feel out of place . He sometimes appears still to be grappling with making his inner nerd comfortable in his millionaire superstar skin . Back in his Brooklyn childhood , Rock says , he was bused across the borough to help racially integrate a school . He was one of four Black kids in an otherwise allWhite high school . " Nobody wanted to talk to me , " he recalls . The girls ? Nothing . " I try to forget about all that , " he says , then chuckles nervously . " Play ? Nothing . Please . The l-a-s-s-s-t guy . I literally did not have anything , nothing , until I was like famous . " He smiles broadly . " I had only been with two women until I got famous . No prom , none of that . " The Problem With the N Word He was the skinny Black boy in a school full of White children , some not above routinely pelting him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his routines . He winces when he is reminded of all the controversy that followed his 1996 HBO special in which he , at great length , tried to describe the difference between Black people and niggers : " A Black man that got two jobs , going to work every day , hates a nigger on welfare . Get a job ! I got two ; you ca n't get one ? ' " But it has not been the backlash to his routine that has bothered him , he explains ; it has been the assumptions some have drawn from his observational comedy . " A whole lot of Black people want to work , " he says . " That 's the only thing I hated about all the press I got in the last couple of years about the niggers and Black people thing . They act like I 'm part of a minority of Black folks that want to do the right thing . " No , I 'm in the majority , " says Rock , pushing away his plate of half-eaten food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm no different than that brother who 's the busboy over there . You know ? " But there is a glaring difference , and Rock knows it : He gets that laughter , that multimillion-dollar laughter . It is the kind of laughter , Rock says , that , when he 's onstage , " is like a release on life .
