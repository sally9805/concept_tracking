The ageless comedian takes us on a joke tour of his Christmas crusades , not forgetting Ronnie in China learning to eat jellybeans with chop sticks . <p> Even the Bible had to have an ending . But there is none to this rambling valentine to my adopted country . I figure I 'm only beginning . After all , when I appeared onstage at Madison Square Garden beside God , God had to sit down . <p> We 're entering exciting times , the ' 90s ; totalitarian governments are crumbling all over the world , and dozens of politicians have been running for cover . I plan to hang around until there are no good monologue topics left . <p> Since this is supposed to be some sort of a history , let me take you for a fast roller-coaster ride through the Marx Brothers comedy that was the late ' 70s and ' 80s . <p> If you were paying attention , you may remember that the Vietnam War finally ended in an agreement neither side intended to honor . It was like one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " I guess you 've heard the good news by now . North Vietnam has finally qualified for foreign aid .... The reason they delayed the peace treaty for so long was that Hanoi was n't sure they had enough ammunition for a cease-fire .... " <p> It was n't long before the North Vietnamese overran the South and Saigon became Ho Chi Minh City . By that time the American public did n't care ; they did n't want any more foreign adventures , unless Sophia Loren was in them . <p> That made it tough on presidents . After Vietnam , when we did launch a military operation , it had to be made to look as if we did n't mean it . <p> When Jimmy Carter was president , he had to try to rescue the Americans taken hostage at our embassy in Teheran with six old helicopters on loan from " M*A*S*H . " They hardly made it to the first commercial . <p> During Reagan 's administration , he had to find a country small enough to beat up without getting Mike Wallace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Grenada . Estelle Getty could have handled that one by herself . <p> Later , President George Bush figured he was playing it safe when he declared war on only one man . Noriega took refuge in the Vatican embassy . We all figured the Catholic Church would know how to handle him ; we expected them to raffle off his car . Finally , the Army played loud rock music until he gave himself up . If he 's convicted , there 's talk of sentencing him to the Grammy Awards . <p> Going back again to Reagan : He won one big victory that secures his place in history  --  he went to China and opened the doors to the West even wider . He found out a lot about their ancient culture . In only two meetings with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping , Ronnie learned how to eat jellybeans with chopsticks . <p> The atmosphere became so cordial , I decided it was time to do a show from Beijing . We called it Road to China , and the cast was a real chopsuey of international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Sesame Street ; Chinese comics Yuan , Hong , and Li ; the Shanghai Circus ; Shields and Yarnell ; Chinese ballerina Zhong Run Liang ; the Philadelphia Boys ' Choir and Men 's Chorale ; and Dolores . The biggest budget item was for interpreters . <p> We were all bubbling over with international good will , and I had no idea how ironic some of my opening remarks were to become : " This is Tienanmen Gate . Tienanmen means The Gate of Heavenly Peace . ' It leads to Tienanmen Square , the biggest square in the world . It looks like Jackie Gleason 's patio .... They can get a million and a half people in here . Of course , they 're not here today . Nobody knew I was coming . " <p> Heavenly peace did n't last very long . Only a few years later , the people were mowed down in Tienanmen Square by the People 's Army . But at our show back then , we had a warm and happy audience , including Ambassador Leonard Woodcock and a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I really ca n't believe I 'm here , but this must be China . Last night , I went to a movie called America Syndrome .... I 'm part of a cultural exchange . The State Department sends me over here and the Chinese send back a yak who can count to ten . ... We had a great flight over , but I 'll ..... tell you one thing : this is a long way to come for a Coca-Cola .... They gave me quite a ride to the hotel from the airport . Twice , I fell off the handlebars .... And can you believe the auto horns.9 Peking sounds like a whole city that just got married .... And let me tell you , I loved the Great Wall . Of course , I love anything as old as I am .... Service at the Peking Hotel is really fast , especially the laundry . Yesterday they washed my pajamas , and I was still in them . " <p> And I summed it all up by saying , " What this trip is all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and singing and dancing together , the way good friends should . And liking each other . The Chinese are easy to like . " <p> But behind the scenes , there were warning signs . We had a brilliant Chinese actor , Ying Ruo Cheng , to act as interpreter and show us around Beijing , or Peking , depending on when you studied geography . You may have seen Ying in the Marco Polo miniseries , playing Kublai Khan . Later , he translated Death of a Salesman into Chinese and played the lead . I do n't know what a Chinese salesman would sell , maybe fortune cookies , but Ying was a great performer . He used to translate my jokes for our Chinese audiences and started getting bigger laughs than I did , until he realized his mistake . He helped us do a spot from Democracy Wall , a wall in Beijing where the people could post their opinions , including opinions of the government . The deputy minister of culture got a look at it  --  the Chinese reviewed all our film  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out . " So we rewrote it and tried it again . They still did n't like it . Too much democracy was showing up at the Democracy Wall . They finally took Ying away from us and replaced him with a .... member of the Communist Party . Apparently , his party dues were n't paid up , because after we shot the scene with him , they took it out again and it never reached the air . <p> After that , we did n't have much heavenly peace . They gave us a terrible time at the airport when we were leaving , searching our luggage for our film . They opened Dolores ' bag , and she told them , firmly , " If you unpack that suitcase , you 're going to pack it . " <p> There 's something in Dolores ' voice that does n't require translation . The customs officials closed her suitcase immediately . It was the biggest Chinese defeat since CBS canceled Charlie Chan . <p> Jimmy Carter had the tough break of becoming president at a time when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest definition of a paranoid  --  that 's anyone who 's in possession of all the facts . As I mentioned , the Iranians took the entire staff of the American embassy in Tehran hostage . They would n't let them go until after Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 election . Not that they were that anxious to see Ronnie as president ; they were afraid if he did n't get elected , he 'd go back to acting . <p> The years that followed were a merry time of hijacking , hostage taking , and terrorism . Anybody in Lebanon who had n't been shot at was n't really trying . The Israelis , the Syrians , the Muslims , and the Christians were all fighting at the same time . Beirut was the only town where you could get mugged at confession . So many U.S. citizens were being taken hostage , there was talk of putting the ransom on your American Express card . <p> On April 18 , 1983 , the U.S. embassy in Beirut was virtually destroyed by a car bomb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no peace to keep . Two American marines were the first U.S. fatalities when they were hit by mortar fire near the international airport . The United States sent in the navy , the French sent in planes . If this was n't a war , why was everybody eating K rations ? <p> Naturally , there was a big peace conference , and a ceasefire was declared . Everybody knew what that meant . They put their fingers in their ears and waited . <p> They did n't have to wait long . On October 23 , a terrorist drove a truckload of high explosives through the barriers of the driveway at the U.S. Marine Corps headquarters in Beirut , blew up the building , and killed 241 U.S. marines . It made the explosion we escaped at the Brinks Hotel in Saigon seem like Palm Sunday at Pat Boone 's . <p> The U.S. Department of Defense ordered the Hope Gypsies out of mothballs and into box lunches . After ten years of soft beds and home cooking , there was finally an area of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred in Lebanon than at an Academy Awards rehearsal . <p> And by that time , it was Christmas . <p> In ten years , of course , the Gypsies had changed , and not only around the waistline . Our producer was now Elliott Kozak , a man of infinite patience and talents , one of which was his ability to sleep standing up . That was a necessity on this tour , where our schedule was so tight you only got a chance to lie down if somebody was shooting at you . Our director was Sid Smith , and the writers , commanded by Gene Perrett , were Bob Mills , Fred Fox , Seaman Jacobs , Martha Bolton , and Jeffrey Barron . Of the old gang , only Silvio Caranchini was still with us . Sil had tried to escape several times , but I always got him back with the promise of more money . He believed me , showing how nine trips to Vietnam can soften the brain . <p> Most of our shows were done on the decks of U.S. ships on patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the old battleship U.S.S. New Jersey . I had talked a great group of performers into coming along ; they believed me when I told them we were going to entertain the croupiers at Monte Carlo . We had Cathy Lee Crosby , Ann Jillian , Brooke Shields , and the new Miss U.S.A. Some of the ships were too small to do a show on ; so we just phoned in the act , although there 's no way you could phone in what those gals had . If you could , the military could recruit a whole navy by promising each man a cordless phone . <p> The ships were packed with marines , all of them on alert . Most of them were kids who had n't heard the jokes ; it was a pleasure to get laughs with some lines that were older than the audience . <p> " It 's great to be playing in front of marines . These guys are so tough they use barbed wire for dental floss .... I saw some marines eating a plate of nails . The sissies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After chow the other night I said to one of them , ' Toothpick ? ' And he said , No , thank you . I 'll use my bayonet .... ' Discipline is very strict in the Marine Corps . They 're not even allowed to turn their electric blankets above ' just friendly . ' " <p> I began to hope this was the last generation I could use those jokes on . Or would have to . <p> Laughter does n't solve anything , but then , neither do battleships today . They certainly did n't solve what was going on in Lebanon . I wanted to take our whole group ashore to do a show for the marines in Beirut , or what was left of it , but I was told it was too risky . This war was not just soldier against soldier , but sometimes father against son , brother against brother . The terrorists on both sides drove trucks loaded with TNT to their targets , and only the cowards bothered to get out . Any American was a sitting duck . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me go in alone . <p> I did n't quite know what to expect . We took off from a carrier on Christmas morning and landed at the shot-up marine compound , where the marines now lived in underground bunkers . After the big bomb went off , they 'd learned their lesson . Do n't sleep anyplace that has a driveway . <p> The marines issued me a flak jacket and a helmet . I guess my old movies play everywhere . I saw somebody else similarly dressed , and it turned out to be Johnny Grant , the L.A. radio personality who has played almost as many trouble spots as I have . <p> There was no time or place to do a show ; we were there to see one they put on for us . <p> In a makeshift chapel , American marines in combat dress sang Christmas hymns , and a minister delivered a prayer . And then all the marines sang " Silent Night . " <p> They could n't forget it would always be silent night for 241 of their marine buddies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gypsies finished the tour and returned home . The mood in the States was like during the last days of the Vietnam War . President Reagan gave up trying to play MP to the whole nation of Lebanon and withdrew the navy , the marines , and every American who was n't chained to a bedpost . We pulled everything out of Beirut except one branch of our em bassy . <p> This one was blown up by a station wagon . Trucks were no longer chic . <p> The Gypsies never went back to Beirut . Neither did the marines . I ca n't say any of us misses it . <p> Not everything that happened around that time was a disaster , depending on whether you were a Republican or a Democrat . The presidential campaign was between Ronnie Reagan and Walter Mondale . They scheduled a big TV debate , and it certainly stirred a lot of interest . And monologue jokes . <p> " Ronnie 's advisers are afraid that Reagan will fall asleep while Mondale 's talking . Or worse , while he 's talking .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious . Mondale got a little nervous when he saw skywriting that said : REAGAN in ' 84 . There was no plane . Just a giant finger . Reagan told his campaign manager , ' I 've never let religion have any influence on my presidency . Make a note of that and give it to all my disciples . ' " <p> Ronnie and George Bush won the election easily , which is something of an understatement . Mondale and his veep candidate , Geraldine Ferraro , only carried one state , Minnesota . Ronnie would have carried that one too , but nobody told him it was there . <p> Before he left office , Reagan was offered more than five million dollars for his autobiography . Gorbachev had just written his own and was paid 14 rubles for it . Gorby asked for a summit meeting with Reagan to find out the name of his literary agent . <p> Their meetings made history . Reagan was the actor , but Gorby upstaged him every time . <p> I went on the air with : " Gorbachev started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could shake hands with the spectators . He was the first leader of a country to hold out his hand in our nation 's capital and not come away with foreign aid .... It was easy to spot Gorbachev . His limo had a bumper sticker saying , ' I brake for reporters .... ' Everything Reagan does , Gorbachev does him one better . Reagan wears the flag of his country on his lapel . Gorby wears the map of his country on his forehead . " <p> Glasnost came to mean considerably more than " openness . " Gorbachev was the first disciple of Marx and Lenin to travel with a press agent . <p> We all felt this was truly the beginning of the end of the Cold War . This revolution , everybody would eat strawberries and cream . Things were looking so rosy , I even traded in my Kaopectate . <p> And then , in 1987 , the Ayatollah Khomeini decided to close the Persian Gulf to oil shipments during Iran 's war with Iraq . It was a national crisis . If America did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair with the dry look . He ordered the navy in . Things got pretty tense around November . When it looked like all the oil tanks in the Middle East would go up in flames , somebody in Washington with a sense of humor sent for the Gypsies to do our Christmas act again . After all , if everything blew up , the air force would only have to fly us one way . <p> We were sent by way of Hawaii , Manila , and Cape Espiritu Santo ( I think the Defense Department was trying to confuse us ) until we finally located the 6th Fleet . We did our final Christmas show December 1987 , in the Persian Gulf , some 44 years after our first one , in Europe . This time the villain had a Santa Claus beard instead of a Charlie Chaplin mustache . I guess that 's progress . <p> We called it " Bob Hope 's U.S.O. Christmas Show from the Persian Gulf , or Around the World in Eight Days . " We had to make it in eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on tuna sandwiches . <p> We did one show from Bahrain , an Arab oil sultanate on some islands in the Persian Gulf where everyone was so rich , they hired Merv Griffin as garbage collector . <p> The U.S. had a busy navy base there , and the strange customs of this strange country made for some strange jokes . <p> I told a huge audience of sailors and marines , " Here we are in Bahrain , the real land of brotherly love .... Everyone here looks like Danny Thomas . And that 's just the women .... No show of public affection is allowed . In Bahrain , that 's called the law . Back home it 's called marriage .... Women here ca n't show any skin . I ordered a chicken breast and it was wearing a bra .... This is the kind of country where they cut off your hand for stealing . I do n't even want to think about what they cut off if you steal someone 's wife . " <p> We left them laughing in Bahrain , flew out over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the deck of the U.S.S. Midway . The flight deck was jammed with men who had come , as usual , to see our girls : Cathy Lee Crosby , Ann Jillian , Brooke Shields , Barbara Eden  --  who had brought her two daughters along  --  the Super Bowl Dancers , and Michelle Rogers , the new Miss U.S.A. Of course , the U.S. Navy now included women , but the men on the Midway outnumbered the females stationed aboard by 300 to one . On this carrier , you did n't ask for a date ; you called ahead for a starting time . <p> So we were doubly welcome , first for bringing them more females , but mainly for showing them they were not forgotten during their strange duty , playing tugboat in a floating shooting gallery , 10,000 miles from home at Christmas time with the thermometer at 106 Degrees  --  that was at night . It was the only part of the world where Santa Claus arrived in a bikini . <p> I started my routine with " Here we are in the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate , the oldest aircraft carrier meets the oldest operational comedian .... I knew this carrier was old when someone grabbed my Geritol and poured it into the fuel tanks . " <p> In spite of the laughs and cheers and applause , we all began to feel a little uncomfortable on this hurried trip , as if we were being used as a Band-Aid on public opinion . Our navy and marines were doing their dangerous jobs , but again this was no all-out military effort , and many people questioned its wisdom . Sure , we did need the oil in America . How else could Dolly Parton get into some of her dresses ? But the navy was n't sure how best to carry out its mission in the Gulf . I told the men on the next ship , the U.S.S. Kennedy , " You ought to drain the sucker . Then it 'll be the army 's problem . " <p> Jokes could n't make it go away , but we could do a little to help the men endure the heat and the boredom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to Iran , the Disneyland for fanatics . Iran is where Santa makes three lists : Who 's been naughty , who 's been nice , and who 's nuts . But before we laugh  --  or , preferably for me , after we laugh  --  we ought to consider how sane any nation was during the paranoid ' 80s . <p> We left the Gulf after doing our final Christmas show aboard the U.S.S. Okinawa , where everybody sang " Ave Maria " on the flight deck . <p> We had hardly finished the hymn when both sides in the Gulf began firing at each other again . <p> The insanity at home continued with another political campaign . Sen. Gary Hart , running for the Democratic presidential nomination , was seen by the press coming out the backdoor of his girlfriend 's house . <p> His wife was not amused . <p> Then came November of 1989 , when East Berliners danced with West Berliners near the spot where I had swiped the swastika flag from Adolf Hitler 's bunker . We had n't seen so many happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans danced through the Wall , took one look at the prices , and danced back home . <p> I remembered all the shows we had done in the days when Berlin was in ashes , and later when it was sliced in half like a pumpernickel sandwich . And now , the Wall was coming down and being sold in little pieces in the doorstop section of K Mart . <p> And all the Communists voted themselves out of office and admitted they had been incompetent . This frightened the hell out of Congress ; they were afraid democracy might spread to the United States . <p> Maybe all this means that the Gypsies are now obsolete . I hope so , but knowing the ingenuity of men when it comes to blowing each other up , I 'm not going to unpack yet . It 's the suspense that keeps me young . <p> Everything in my life seemed to come full circle on October 2 , 1989 . I went back to where it all began vaudeville . I had started out in Cleveland in 1923 , doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mildred was about 15 at the time and the act bombed , so I figured this time I 'd go for a little more experience . Almost 14,000 people showed up at Madison Square Garden to see two guys whose ages added up to 179 years do a live act , which I guess a lot of the audience came to see if we could prove . <p> They need n't have worried . George Burns on a stage is as good as Mildred Rosequist ever was . And she could n't dance and smoke a cigar at the same time . George is what vaudeville was all about . When he walked out in that spotlight , you could feel the electricity between him and the audience . Of course , when he first walked out on a vaudeville stage , only George and Benjamin Franklin knew what electricity was . When George walks into a restaurant today and orders a three-minute egg , they make him pay in advance . <p> Madison Square Garden would seem to be a pretty outrageous place for two guys to try to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat each other 's brains out with boxing gloves . But with microphones , a good sound system , and seats crowding right up to the stage , it proved to be sensational . <p> We both wanted to show as many people as possible what vaudeville used to be like . After all , we were only going to give one performance ; it was a little late for us to turn it into a career . <p> And of course , we both needed the money . Those hormone shots are expensive . <p> Vaudeville in the old days was something different every night , because you never knew what to expect from the audience . If they got ugly , it was the performer 's job to keep them from throwing over-aged tomatoes . No laugh machine , no retakes . It was all as live as life itself . <p> As we stood out there , two lonely figures in the glare 9f the spotlights , I felt lucky to have the best 93 - year- old tap dancer in the business as my partner . We only had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one-night stands in places like Williamsport , Pennsylvania , and Hamtramck , Michigan , when we both learned to cook hash over a hotplate in our dressing room and wondered if we 'd eat again tomorrow . We both knew it had n't really changed for us since the days of the Gus Sun Time and the Balaban and Katz vaudeville circuit . This was n't an audience that we faced in Madison Square Garden ; it was a jury . These were n't GI 's grateful for any kind of free entertainment , but New Yorkers only half a mile from Broadway . Go ahead , we could almost hear them saying ; lay an egg , with two old yolks . <p> This could be the flop heard ' round the world . <p> Of course , if it had been , I would n't be mentioning it here . We must have done pretty well , because we got offers to play the Miami Arena , the Detroit Dome , and Sun City right after we finished . In Sun City we 'll be considered a kiddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the ring at Madison Square Garden , I pretended it was still Cleveland . I hit ' em with local jokes . <p> George Burns came out all alone , and held the stage for almost an hour . After all the years of being Gracie 's straight man , he has finally been recognized as one of our best stand-up comedians . Even though he had to sit down . <p> When the laughter died down , I walked out to join George for the first time on a stage . We did one of the routines George had made famous in vaudeville with Gracie ; I played Gracie under protest and a lady 's hat , which somebody tossed to us from the audience . <p> It was a strange feeling , being half of Burns and Allen , even in fun . The two of them had been the real vaudeville , and one of the true love stories of another generation . I wondered what George was thinking , but I could n't see through the cigar smoke . But after we danced " Tea for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , Gracie , " and I said " Good night , Gracie , " and he smiled , and we walked offstage , arm in arm . <p> The team of Burns and Hope had finally made the Big Time . <p> The audience in the Garden stood up and cheered the way the crowd did when Joe Louis kayoed Max Schmeling at Yankee Stadium . <p> You do n't remember that far back ? It does n't matter . George and I do . <p> It was only yesterday . You be the Judge <p> With romance in the air , fences meant nothing to Farmer Jones ' unpedigreed but vigorous bull . In due course , Farmer Smith , whose pasture adjoined Jones ' , learned that five of his choicest purebred cows had given birth to calves of dubious ancestry . Jones admitted that his bull had jumped the fence . Smith sued Jones for damages . <p> " There is no evidence as to how the bull got into Smith 's pasture , " argued counsel for Jones , " yet we do know that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Presumably the bull leaped it , but Jones did all that the law required to prevent the beast from trespassing . " <p> " Nevertheless , " Smith 's lawyer replied , " the law specifically makes the owner of a trespassing bull liable for whatever damage it causes . " <p> If you were the judge , would you make Jones pay damages ? <p> Jones had to pay . The court said that if the law appeared harsh , it was up to the legislature  --  not the court  --  to change it . <p> Based on a 1960 Iowa decision .
