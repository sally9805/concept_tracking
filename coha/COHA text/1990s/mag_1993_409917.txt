We have two images of a monastery : One is a sinister place of dank corridors , icy cells , and cold stone ; the other a kind of medieval , Monty-Pythonesque farce . The Abbey of Regina Laudis in Bethlehem , Connecticut , where I stayed for several days as a guest of the Benedictine order , is neither . Entering this world is like stepping back into a quaint , rustic paradise that existed long ago  --  in the age of oxen-yoked plows and horse-drawn carriages . I visited the abbey  --  working with the nuns as they brought in their harvest  --  because it was the home of a romantic and true story of Hollywood , God , and Elvis that has mystified America for 30 years . In 1962 , Dolores Hart was a 24-year-old movie star with Grace Kelly looks and 11 films already to her credit , including Where the Boys Are , Loving You , and King Creole . In the latter two she costarred with Elvis Presley . There were rumors of a love affair and , later , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , in 1963 , she gave it all up to become a nun  --  joining a cloistered monastery and disappearing from celebrityhood forever . Ever since , Hart 's exquisite beauty and her friendship with Elvis Presley in the fresh dawn of his fame have made her the subject of lurid legends . In a society that regards Hollywood fame as Heaven , we presume that someone who gives it all up must be either crazy , ungrateful , or tainted by some terrible scandal . Her religious vows have prevented Mother Dolores ( as she is now known ) from answering such questions as : Did she have a love affair with Elvis ? Did she bear the King 's child  --  a Dauphin of rock " n ' roll ? What kind of life does she lead today and does she ever regret giving up her star 's crown for a nun 's halo ? More generally , why give up the routines of the rat race for the rigors of the monastery ? When an ex-lion tamer named Philip Stanic from Gary , Indiana , changed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began a career as an Elvis impersonator , and claimed he was the fruit of Elvis 's passionate affair with Dolores Hart in 1961 , the press leapt on the story . Mother Dolores , banned from formal interviews by the Archbishop of Hertford , could not answer the accusations against her . Despite the attempts of a series of investigative journalists , they could not speak with her , nor even confirm that it was her they had seen while attending services at the monastery 's quaint chapel . But as it seemed to me that she would want the truth told , I began a personal quest to speak with her that was almost as weird but ultimately as satisfying as Hart 's own spiritual journey . A combination of talent and looks  --  that cherubic innocence mixed with feline sensuality  --  made Hart a star almost overnight . She survived her turbulent family ( her parents were alcoholics ) by converting to Catholicism at the age of 10 . At 18 , in 1956 , Paramount signed her to a seven-year contract . Thirty-seven years later I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . The nun at the gate took a message but warned me that Mother Dolores was unlikely to return the call . Minutes later , my phone rang . It was a woman named Barbara Simon , who said she was calling " on behalf of the abbey " to say that Dolores Hart would not speak but that the allegations of the young man calling himself Elvis Presley , Jr. , were lies . When I asked her where she was calling from , the phone went dead . Now fully intrigued , I set out to enlist the help of another classic character of the silver screen : Patricia Neal , the stunning , Oscar-winning star of Hud and Breakfast at Tiffany 's . Once Roald Dahl 's wife , once Gary Cooper 's lover , she had been felled in her prime by a near-fatal stroke . She recovered , I knew , with the help of ... the Abbey of Regina Laudis . The formidable Miss Neal  --  charming , gravelly , and outrageous , met me in a New York City diner and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooper , who introduced both her and Dolores Hart to Regina Laudis . She and Dolores spoke often and perhaps , if I was a good boy , she purred , she would mention me to Mother Dolores . " If you 're lucky , " the old screen siren added raffishly . Days passed without a word . Just when it seemed my quest was over , the phone call came . I recognized the voice on the telephone the moment I picked it up . Even if I did not remember its distinctive trill from all those films , it was possibly the softest and most graceful voice I had ever heard : " My name is Mother Dolores . I know that you called for me . " At once I asked if we could meet , but she reminded me that they were a closed order at the abbey : " The only reason I am talking to you is out of courtesy to your relationship with Patricia . " Afraid that our conversation might end as abruptly as the mysterious Ms. Simon 's , I wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dolores denied she ever had any love affair with him , quaintly calling him " Mr. Presley . " " I had a very good and sound and clean relationship with Mr. Presley ; we were good friends . Mr. Presley was one of the finest persons I ever worked with in Hollywood . So no one can spoil our association . During the time we worked on it , we were good friends on the set and we had a good working relationship . We liked each other but we were not ... we were never romantically linked . I was never in that kind of association with him . " I asked about the ex-lion tamer who claimed to be her son . " There is no truth in what that young man has said , " she answered . " He has abused both my name and Mr. Presley 's . My name is not nearly as interesting to the press , but it does make a good story . So it is not right for this young man to try to create such an atmosphere in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disbelieve her , since many of the nuns happily admit love affairs before taking holy orders  --  as well as temptations afterward . I asked her what kind of life she led there ? Did she work or just pray ? " I do all sorts of work here . In fact , I would like to invite you to visit and stay at the abbey because you have certainly been gracious and kind to me . I would like to extend our hospitality . Monastic life is very simple . You 'd have to come up and see . But I can not promise you we would ever meet . Would you like to stay ? " The following weekend the crotchety , bespectacled Sister Mary Elisabeth picked me up at the bus station in a big , scarred station wagon and drove me toward the aptly named Bethlehem . Only seven of the 47 nuns ever leave the estate to do chores  --  such as collecting me . The rest spend the remainder of their lives there . " I hope your cell 's not too hot , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's almost 100 degrees today . Hot for haymaking . " I stayed at a cottage for male visitors . My cell was tiny , hot , austere : exactly like the nuns ' cells in their quarters . As I stood peering at the " enclosure  --  a wall surrounding the sisters ' living area  --  I heard the roar of a tractor as it whizzed by , just missing me by a hair  --  a determined and somewhat ancient nun at the wheel , driving at top speed . Later , I heard bells ringing and saw a nun driving a chariot pulled by two oxen  --  my introduction to the bucolic pleasures of Mother Dolores ' life after Hollywood . Wandering around the 400 acres , I found the most active nuns I could have imagined : Mother Stephen , head of the farm ( she bears one of the abbey 's splendid array of medieval titles : Land Master ) , was feeding cows , supervising strawberry picking , haymaking , and milking . She called each cow by its nickname and fed it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she shrugged as she poured out the hay : " Everyone here is blessed with some special gift . " In between all this muscular activity , the nuns have a praying routine that fills up most of their days . They must also rise at 1:15 A.M. to sing Matins for an hour and then again at 6:15 A.M. for Laudins . Bells ring to summon them to prayer . At 8 the next morning I attended Mass . The nuns were huddled on the other side of the altar , behind a wooden grille , singing like celestial canaries in incomprehensible Latin . I could not see whether Mother Dolores was there or not  --  the grille was too dense , the curtain too opaque . By a rather bizarre coincidence that Mother Dolores would most likely call the " Will of God , " Father-Abbot Matthew Stark 's " early morning homily " ( as the nuns call his sermon ) began : " In a time when the word " awesome " is used to describe a slice of pizza and it is said that Elvis lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how out of touch we are with the glory of the Lord . " After Mass I was summoned by the Guest Master ( another medieval title ) , Mother Placid , who has been at the abbey since 1949 . I walked to the edge of the enclosure wall and around the back of it to a little door . I knocked . A voice said " Enter . " There was another door on which a sign read SAINT PLACID . I knocked again and entered . The jolly and energetic nun sat on the other side of a wooden grill to enlighten me about the lives of the saints . It was so hot that both Mother Placid , who was 66 and of course wearing her full habit , and I were sweating profusely in the little parlor of Saint Placid . She asked if I would like to work that day , and I told her I would like to help with the harvest . " Mother Stephen will be delighted , " she smiled . " And will I able to meet Mother Dolores ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's very busy , but maybe you 'll be lucky .... " The sun was beating down on the rich , golden fields . It was the hottest day of a record-breaking heat wave . Mother Stephen was driving a bale-making machine behind her tractor while I worked with some nuns and volunteers piling up the bales , throwing them onto trucks , and then unloading them into barns near the dairy cows . It was hard work . Mother Stephen insisted we drink every five minutes , and the nuns prepared huge vats of iced lemon juice to prevent us from getting heat stroke . The scene was surreal if idyllic  --  something from another century . But the strangest part was that the nuns were harvesting in their black habits as if they were in chapel . Yet they worked very hard , sweating and laboring in the dust and heat as if they were farmers . But there was still no sign of Mother Dolores . I must admit that I had expected long , cold , stone corridors and nuns lamenting in Latin behind iron grilles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so muscular that they could throw bales of hay 10 feet in the air , to the very top of the stack . When I tried the same feat , I almost dislocated my arm . The nuns , their habits covered in hay stubble and earth , hooted with laughter at my lack of strength . When I was summoned by Mother Placid a second time , it was the end of the day . I was tanned and aching from the work , and I was becoming anxious : Would I ever meet the enigmatic Mother Dolores ? I knew it was unlikely but still , I hoped .... The celibate life of the nuns is the source of the most misunderstandings and humor about monastic life . I asked Mother Placid about the Benedictine Order 's attitude toward female sexuality . " Is that your favorite subject ? " she chuckled . I blushed . It was the third time I had asked her about it . " For us in the outside world , the celibacy is the most inexplicable part of your life . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outsiders think we 're shocked by sex , " she said . " We 're not opposed to sexuality here , except when it is soulless and empty . Do n't you ever feel empty inside if you have sex without the community of love and creation ? " Strangely enough , I admitted this had sometimes happened to me . " There you are , " she answered . " But I 'm not about to give it up . Do n't you ever feel sexual desire here ? " " Of course . We are human . We also see the animals on the farm . We know temptation and sometimes it is a good test . But we have given up all selfish personal appetites . We have no property of our own . We do n't say anyone else should live this life . Just that we have been selected to do so . Our vocation is to serve the Lord and devote all our energy to Him . " " What happens if you join and then feel you 're missing out on sex ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , it is hurtful and difficult . It is a great challenge and discipline . That is why we prefer our recruits to be at least 25 , because we like them to know enough about life to make the decision to join us . " " Do you want them to be virgins ? Can they know about love ? " I was only partly thinking about Dolores . " Of course they can . I was in love several times as a young girl . Why not ? Besides , a couple of the nuns here are widows who joined when their husbands died . That 's fine , too . " Then she smiled and asked : " Have you ever been in love ? " Since she had been honest , I saw no reason to lie . " No . I thought I was a couple of times , but when I look back , I 'm not so sure I ever was . " Now she was asking the questions . " You are an intelligent young man and I feel you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a girlfriend ? " " Not exactly a girlfriend . She 's more like a lover , " I answered . " Never been in love , " she muttered , almost to herself . Silence . Then there was a knock at the door on her side of the grille . Was it Dolores Hart at last ? Was this the end of the quest ? The door opened .... Mother Dolores 's full-lipped face with its high cheekbones and retrousse nose is unchanged by her 54 years . She also possesses an extraordinary calmness in her cherubic expression and that most lilting of voices . Certainly the face was redder than it had been 30 years ago  --  she has worked out on the farm , haying and baling as I had that afternoon  --  but it is still a face of undeniable beauty . Her hair is covered by her wimple , but other nuns told me later that it is still a luscious blonde . Thirty years on , this is still undeniably the face to launch a thousand ships . We shook hands through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Welcome , " Dolores said angelically , her face close to the grille . " I hope you are enjoying your stay and seeing how we live . " " I hope the trouble with the young man called Elvis Presley , Jr. , is over , " I said . They both looked rather shocked at the mention of Elvis and the son he never had . " It 's gone quiet now , mercifully . The young man 's real mother is looking for him and actually called here . It 's unfortunate , but the mother said he wo n't respond to her because she knows Elvis was not the father . I feel sorry for him . " Our meeting , said Mother Placid , was almost over . Dolores said she was sorry we could not meet face-to-face , or for longer . She is busy . It is harvest . There is also the ban of the Archbishop . " Obedience and stability , " explained Mother Placid , " are the foundations of our Order . " Mother Dolores bowed to me again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was already gone . She had only stayed a minute or two . But it reminded me of our earlier phone conversation , when I asked if she had enjoyed her fame . " Oh , by all means , " she 'd replied without any hint of regret . " But how and why did you decide to leave Hollywood ? " " Only soul-searching brings a knowledge of what your life will be . It only sounds sudden when you announce it because people do n't know what has gone on before . " " Do n't you ever want to go back to being an actress ? " " There 's always continuity . In the dimension of monastic life , there is a role in prayer that certainly keeps me very much a part of it . You see for me being a nun is being an actress . " That was when I understood that the answer to the riddle of Mother Dolores is as simple as this : You only have to experience the richness of the austere life at the abbey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That night was my last at the abbey . I felt absolutely rejuvenated and sorry to leave after so short a stay . I retired to bed early after dinner as is the way there . My prickly , driven tension had been massaged into a generous goodwill towards the world that surprised me more than anyone . I felt an intense calm . Mother Dolores had neither said much nor stayed long , yet the riddle of why she left Hollywood was suddenly self-evident : The happiness of the nuns speaks for itself . Like many others , I could not imagine how anyone could give up the pleasures of being a movie star to live and work in a monastery . Yet when Mother Placid talked to me about love , which she said she felt all around her , I could see that she experienced it in its most austere yet warmest sense . And she could see that while I was bathed in sensualism , I had quite forgotten about love . I had gone to the abbey to search for Dolores Hart . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presley . Instead , I discovered a warm and neglected part of myself . I did not become religious . No one tried to convert me to anything . Looking back , I realized that when I left I took something with me and left something behind . Somewhere amongst the golden fields and the flying bales , the giggling nuns and the relentless embrace of the sun , I had left a bit of myself that will always be there . And when the reservoir of that simplest of happiness gets low again , I might go back and visit them . If I ever do return , I am sure I will find it there again , untouched , just where I left it . It is late at night . My tiny cell in the cottage called " Saint Joseph 's " is stiflingly hot . I can not sleep . I wait for the bell to ring for Matins . The old-fashioned telephone begins to ring in the very still night . It makes an archaic " dring-dring " sound like a phone in an old Dolores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is Mother Placid . " You touched my heart when you said you had never been in love , " she says . " Please could you tell me what is the name of the girl who is your lover . I know your name already . All I need is her first name . " " Her name is Nicola . Why do you ask ? " " So I can pray for you both , " she says . " Good night . " <p>
