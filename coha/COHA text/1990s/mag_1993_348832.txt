WHAT PASSING BELLS FOR those who die as cattle ? Or for those who escape the slaughterhouse . They arrived packed into open-topped trucks , the lucky ones crushed painfully against the cold steel sides yet able to gulp down the winter air as the convoy of refugees crawled its way from the front-line Bosnian Muslim town of Srebrenica to the relative safety of Tuzla . The unlucky ones  --  five small children and two women  --  died on the journey , their lives pressed out in the tight huddle of frightened humanity . <P> " They were alive when we passed Edrinjaca , " sobbed Hanifa Hajdarovic , whose two children , Senija , 5 , and Senad , a babe in arms , did not survive the harrowing , eight-hour passage through Serb lines . " But there was a jolt . I was knocked down , and my children were both crushed . We thought we would be safe if we left Srebrenica . " <P> The United Nations rescue convoys were well meant . But twice last week as the trucks lined up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instincts got the better of a panic-stricken populace . Desperate to escape the encircled city where 60,000 Muslims have been trapped by the Bosnian Serb offensive , they stormed the transports . At least four , probably more , died in the stampedes and harried U.N . officials , already accused of abetting the Serb aim of ethnic cleansing by evacuating Muslims , called off further convoys until new security measures could be put in place . <P> Dazed refugees who arrived in Tuzla spoke of the hellish conditions of the journey , with as many as 180 people packed into trucks designed to carry sacks of food . Some admitted to bribing army commanders to get on ; others fought for places , pushing aside those too weak to retaliate . A little boy who survived a fall from one of the trucks en route ran screaming alongside the roaring convoy until a Serb army major hoisted him back on board . " When you see the refugees you only have to imagine what it 's like for the people inside , " said Simon Mardel , a British doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They are fighting for their lives to get out . " <P> Inside a Tuzla sports hall being used to house the evacuees , Merima Sinanovic , a small 20-year-old woman , sits quietly . Her soft blue eyes are set in a face etched with pain and grief . After Serb nationalists sacked her hometown of Vlasenica early in the war , killing her parents , she and her three young brothers roamed the forests in search of food and shelter . " We learned to survive from the old people who had lived through the Second World War , " she explains . " They told us how to cook tree buds into a kind of bread . They were surprised by this war . They said the last war was n't anything like this one . They said there was a lot more butchery in this one . " <P> When word came of a possible evacuation , Merima and her brothers trekked through the snow to Srebrenica . " We slept on the street around fires for five days , " she says , showing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food aid parachuted out of U.S. airplanes by rushing to the drop sites with thousands of other hungry refugees . But that soon ran out . " For the past three days we did n't eat anything . It was like we were in the forests again except we were in a town , in front of U.N . soldiers . "
