Controversies over guest speakers on American campuses are nothing new , but rarely does one become an international incident . From the moment last year that Cornell University asked a distinguished graduate to address an alumni gathering , policymakers for the U.S. and China knew they had a first-class hot potato on their hands . The invitee was Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui , whose government is unrecognized by most of the world thanks to China 's strenuous efforts to keep it isolated . Could Lee visit a onetime ally that cut off relations 16 years ago ? The issue seemed strictly academic as long as Washington upheld its policy of barring top-level Taiwan officials from the country . Then last week , Bill Clinton backed down : under pressure from Congress , the President granted Lee a visa . The hot potato dropped . <P> Beijing 's protests were unusually fierce . Foreign Minister Qian Qichen summoned the U.S. Ambassador , J. Stapleton Roy , for a diplomatic dressing down . As Defense Minister Chi Haotian 's scheduled visit this month to the U.S. was postponed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American government rescind this wrongful decision . " Speculation about reprisals was the buzz of both capitals . Possible countermeasures discussed range from China 's cancellation of Boeing jetliner purchases to the still unlikely option of closing the U.S. consulate in Chengdu , capital of the hinterland province Sichuan and a doorway to restless Tibet . <P> To mainland communists , Taiwan 's simple existence as an offshore rival under the rule of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek 's Nationalist heirs is an open rebuke of their legitimacy and a thumb in their eye  --  even as they pursue detente with the island 's regime and ardently court Taiwan investment and trade . China 's leaders are wondering whether Clinton was signaling both a reversal of 23 years of Sino-American rapprochement and a precedent for other countries , including Japan , to follow . A Western diplomat in Beijing remarked , " I think what is of concern to them is less the specific development than where such a development could lead . " <P> The White House 's defense was  --  well , defensive . Clinton 's apologia basically was Congress made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitol Hill could no longer be ignored . Although pressure was strongest from Republican conservatives who swept congressional elections last November , sentiments in favor of Lee were bipartisan : nonbinding resolutions for the visa passed both the House and Senate by nearly unanimous votes . While Clinton 's advisers refused at first to budge on the issue , they began worrying about a Republican bill that would force their hands and , in effect , remove China policy from presidential control . In their view , a pre-emptive cave-in was the better part of valor . <P> Under terms of his privilege , Lee 's June 9 visit to Cornell 's campus in the upstate New York town of Ithaca will remain the homecoming of a private traveler to his alma mater . That suits Lee well enough . A 1968 Cornell graduate in agriculture and economics , the Taiwan leader has lately made " private " excursions abroad the calling card of his quietly persistent efforts to break the island 's isolation . Last year his golfing tours of some Southeast Asian countries , mixed with unofficial summiteering at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation diplomacy .
