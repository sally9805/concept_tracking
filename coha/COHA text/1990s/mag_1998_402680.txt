Counterfeit software is everywhere-on the Net , in stores , even on your new PC . And It can cost you big . // ANNIE JONES watched as Baldwin Park , California , police officers surrounded a building containing the offices of Compact Media . Jones ( not her real name ) had been staking out the place since receiving an anonymous tip that it actually housed a software counterfeiting operation . The police had their guns drawn as Jones glanced at her watch : 2:30 a.m. , March 6 , 1998 . Suddenly , people began to leave the building , and the officers moved in . They nabbed one of the employees , Kenneth Khoung , at his sport utility vehicle . In his car they found 3400 counterfeit copies of Microsoft Office Professional . Police also apprehended Shawn Wang , the 24-year-old owner of the counterfeiting plant . Inside the building , Jones and her partner , investigators for Microsoft , found four CD replicators ( worth over a million dollars each ) , two silk-screening machines for printing CD labels , three shrink-wrap devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDs a month . The next day while searching Wang 's car , investigators found a receipt from a local storage facility . There they hit more pay dirt : an estimated $4 million worth of counterfeit Microsoft software , still on CD spindles . All in all , six people were arrested .  --  Shawn Wang , Kai Lin Chen , and Kenneth Hoa Khoung-were charged with possession of counterfeit materials and counterfeiting equipment . Wang had not been sentenced at press time . According to Baldwin Park Detective Chris Hofford , " The max he can get is eight to ten years . " Chen and Khoung will each serve a maximum of two years . Does this incident sound more like a detective movie than a day in the life of software company employees ? It might come as a surprise to learn that when you go shopping for software bargains , you may actually be contributing to the wealth of crimi nals like Shawn Wang-or of even worse characters . PIRATES EVERYWHERE COUNTERFEITING IS JUST one of many forms of software piracy . The most common is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and load it on their own PC , or by businesses that are n't careful to buy enough licenses for the software they use . But more organized forms of piracy abound . Computer resellers and others often release what 's known as gray market software-authentic software that 's sold in violation of a distribution agreement . Small PC makers load supposedly free copies of software on the systems they sell . Scofflaws post software for illegal download on the Internet . And a few unscrupulous people seek to enrich themselves through counterfeiting . You may not be overly concerned that software companies lose out when their products are pirated . But when you buy counterfeit or gray market software , you 're getting ripped off , too . You wo n't be eligible for technical support , and you may be buying programs with viruses , or old , buggy versions . Buying counterfeit goods is also illegal . Though you 're unlikely to be arrested , you 're contributing to a criminal activity . If you 're a small business , you could be liable for hefty fines-even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pays to be informed . Sandy Boulton , director of Autodesk 's antitheft division , says , " We 've been running an antipiracy program since 1989 , and based on empirical data , it looks as if for every legal product we sell , there are seven illegal versions in the market . " The numbers for the software industry as a whole are n't quite as staggering . According to the Business Software Alliance , a coalition of software publishers , 27 percent of all software used in the United States is pirated . Worldwide , that number jumps to an astonishing 40 percent . The BSA estimates that all forms of software piracy cost the U.S. economy $i billion in lost taxes and 130,000 lost jobs in 1996 , and that the U.S. software industry lost $ii.4 billion of revenue in 1997 . HAVE YOU BEEN BILKED ? RICHARD LANGE , a computer consultant in Wolf Point , Montana , bought a computer at an auction site for only $300 . Sweetening the deal were preinstalled copies of Windows 98 and Microsoft Office 97 Professional . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuals , and no certificates of authenticity for the software . He called the company he bought the computer from , thinking the missing CDs and certificates were an oversight . Its reps said they 'd sell him the Windows discs for $45 . " That sounded real suspicious , " says Lange ( although missing discs are not always an indication of piracy ) . When Lange checked with Microsoft , the company told him it was likely that his software was pirated-and his copy was therefore not eligible for technical support or a license agreement . Not only that , but because he did n't get a CD of Windows 98 , he was missing the tutorials that come with legitimate versions of the software . You , too , may have purchased pirated software without knowing it . If you bought a no-name computer with preinstalled software but did n't get registration forms or ( for Microsoft products ) a certificate of authenticity , that software might be pirated . If you got a fabulous price on software at a swap meet or online auction , or from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine , that item , too , may be illegal . It 's often hard to tell pirated software from the real thing , though . Unless you buy from a well-known source , the only way to be sure your software is legitimate is to ask its manufacturer if the place you bought it from is an authorized reseller . But pirated versions get into buyers ' hands in so many ways , even the software companies sometimes ca n't tell the good from the bad . THE GRAY MARKET GRAY MARKET SOFTWARE is the real thing , produced by the software vendor but sold in violation of a distribution agreement . Often it wo n't come with all the retail packaging . Other than that , it can be hard to distinguish from legitimate software . Three types of software make up most of the gray market : products from original equipment manufacturers , academic versions , and discs from Microsoft 's Worldwide Fulfillment Program ( formerly called the Easy Fulfillment Program ) . OEM software comes bundled with PCs and other hardware as part of a marketing agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually states that the software is not to be sold separate from the hardware . But it often is . Either the hardware vendor decides to make a few dollars on the side and sell the OEM software by itself , or the software is stolen , ending up on the open market . Software publishers also offer discounted academic versions of their programs to students and teachers who have legitimate identification . Some gray market resellers repackage this software , removing all evidence that it is an academic version . Others simply sell it without requiring ID . Microsoft 's Worldwide Fulfillment Program was created for corporations . If a company needs 1000 copies of Office 97 , it can buy a site license at a significant discount . Instead of getting 1ooo boxed programs , the company receives CDs and manuals , which are clearly marked as part of the program . But some gray marketers pose as corporations so as to buy these site licenses , then sell the software to unwitting consumers or distributors . All three types of gray market software are widely available at online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in computer magazines-usually at dirt-cheap prices . According to Cynthia Navarro , senior investigator at Adobe , " Any copy you see of Adobe Photoshop for less than $400 is probably gray market . " Remember , when you buy on the gray market , you 've been conned . When you go to register your program , the company may be aware that the copy you have is illegal , even if you do n't . Such applications are n't eligible for upgrades or technical support-they may not even be the latest version . FROM GRAY TO BLACK INCREASINGLY , what you buy may be counterfeit . But counterfeiters rarely bother to copy the retail version . The box , manuals , and packaging simply add too much to their production costs . Instead , they copy OEM and Microsoft 's Worldwide Fulfillment software , which come without packaging and documentation . " It saves the counterfeiter money and offers what might seem to the consumer like a reasonable excuse for the lack of documentation or certificate of authenticity , " says Sarah Alexander , international corporate issues manager for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of distributors who eventually sell the software to end users . If the distributors themselves have not been fooled into thinking they 're reselling legitimate software , they 'll try to persuade you that their wares are on the level . They normally provide a registration number that will unlock the protection mechanism on your new CD . But when you try to register the software or obtain technical support , you 'll usually be out of luck . The registration numbers are often stolen , fake , or copied during the counterfeiting process . If it was ever a legitimate number , the software publisher will know it has been compromised . If it is not a real number , the publisher will know that , too . // Too Good to Be True , // Craig Hammersmith , a student and network administrator in Morrison , Colorado , thought he had found a terrific deal on Microsoft Office Pro at Onsale Exchange ( now Yahoo Auction ) , a popular person-to-person Web auction site . Hammersmith was initially suspicious ofthe prices ( $70 to $80 ) that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , and they speculated that it must be overstock , ' he says . " One person was selling 500 copies . How could they advertise illegal software like that ? I thought it must be legit . " But what he got was a CD in a jewel case , marked Microsoft Easy Fulfillment , and no documentation . When he realized the CD did not come with a certificate of authenticty , he called the vendor , who told him not to worry , Easy Fulfillment did n't come with a certificate ( not true ) . Finally , Hammersmith called Microsoft 's piracy hot line ( 800/ 785-3448 ) and learned he had indeed purchased counterfeit software . In the end , Hammersmith confronted the vendor who had sold him the fake goods , and he eventually got his money back . WHY SHOULD YOU CARE ? ON A GOOD DAY , you can get a counterfeit copy of Microsoft Office on the Web for just $35-up to 94 percent off retail . If it works and if you 're certain you 'll never call tech support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , buying counterfeit goods is against the law . Of course , if you are caught , the worst that 's likely to happen to you is confiscation of your software . But there are other reasons to avoid counterfeit items . // The Real Deal // When you buy software from a legitimate source , you get a license to use it . The license usually entitles you to upgrade offers . But if you 're a business , large or small , the license is even more important . The Business Software Alliance and the Software Publishers Association , another industry trade group , actively audit software licenses in businesses and can fine a firm up to $100 , ooo ( through a civil court judgment ) for each product it finds in violation . Do n't think you wo n't get caught . The BSA and the SPA both operate confidential hot lines for reporting software piracy . On average the BSA gets loo to 15o calls per month , of which it pursues about 70 percent . In the past five years , the BSA has collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation of license agreements . Even if you 're never caught with counterfeit software , you could be letting yourself in for other headaches . Since the software you bought was manufactured or distributed by an unknown source , you have no assurance that it wo n't have viruses or be an earlier , buggier version of the program you thought you were buying . Criminals are not known for stringent quality control . According to Detective Jess Bembry , a 27-year veteran of the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department who has arrested a number of software counterfeiters , even the crooks admit that " only about 15 to so percent of the software they produce is any good . " Every software firm we spoke to said it had encountered problems with counterfeit software , from viruses to shoddy workmanship . And when these companies get tech support calls from users of bad software , they have to tell callers they ca n't help . But perhaps the most compelling reason to avoid ( and report ) counterfeit and gray market software is that the money you spend usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are gangs . Adobe investigator Navarro says that the huge amount of money to be made in the software gray market has inspired various-often enemy-gangs to work together . " They recruit people with no criminal background to go work for a hardware or software company-usually in shipping and receiving . These recruits can pass the background checks that software and hardware companies run on new employees , " she explains . Once inside , the new hire scopes out the situation so the gang can commit a robbery . After the software has been ripped off , it 's often funneled to international gangs-in places such as East Asia , Russia , Nigeria , and Ireland  --  for distribution . Where do the profits go ? Into the pockets of criminals involved in drug trafficking . " Narcotics agents are finding a lot of software and hardware when they do raids now , " Navarro says . SOFTWARE MEETS THE MOB BUT WHEN IT comes to counterfeiting software , street gangs are small potatoes . Setting up a large-scale counterfeit operation takes lots of money . A single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to Bob Kruger , vice president of enforcement at the Business Software Alliance , " When you 're talking about counterfeiting , you 're talking about people who have organization . And they can be very hard-core criminals . " Who are these criminals ? Think Scarface , with an Asian twist . At the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department , much of software counterfeiting falls under the jurisdiction of the Asian Organized Crime Unit . " San Gabriel Valley in the Los Angeles area is the counterfeit capital for the U.S. as far as software is concerned , " says Detective Bembry , a key investigator in the Asian Organized Crime Unit . Detective Marcus Frank of the Westminster Police Department in Orange County adds , " There are high-level syndicates behind the majority of counterfeiting , probably emanating out of Asia . " George Abbott , managing director of the International AntiCounterfeiting Coalition in Washington , D.C. , agrees most counterfeit goods come from the Pacific Rim . Software counterfeiting appeals to organized crime because it is a white-collar offense that does n't pull long prison terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other operations that are far more illegal . " They 've used the money from counterfeiting to finance guns , drugs , gambling , prostitution ... as well as legitimate businesses , " says Bembry . While much counterfeiting is carried out in this country , a large chunk takes place overseas-again , mostly in Asia . In 1997 , U.S. Customs seized $54.1 million in counterfeit imports , including software , film , music , and clothing , according to Bruce Raine , senior import specialist at the U.S. Customs service in Los Angeles . Much of the merchandise ( $14.5 million worth ) came from China . The amount of piracy in China has caught the attention of the White House . In a speech to the SPA in September 1997 , Vice President Al Gore called the level of piracy in China . alarming and unacceptable . " He told the group , " We went eyeball-to-eyeball with the Chinese in 1995-right to the point of sanctions-before they gave us a sweeping and comprehensive agreement to enforce intellectual property rights . Now we have to make sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be needed . Brad Smith , Microsoft general counsel international , says he has seen a still more ominous element in the software piracy food chain . " I 'm not prepared to talk about specifics , " he says , " but we have seen organized criminal groups using the proceeds from software counterfeiting to pay for terrorist operations overseas . We have seen a couple of terrorist organizations get involved in software counterfeiting . " It 's not the first time terrorists have been mentioned in connection with counterfeiting . Testifying before Congress in October 1995 , Dempster Leech , a detective who has investigated counterfeiters , implicated terrorists . According to a summary of the hearings , Leech discussed counterfeiting in general . The summary reads , in part : " Money generated from counterfeiting supports organized crime , Leech said , adding that recently , several high-level players indicted in a counterfeiting organization were financially tied to terrorist groups such as the one that bombed the World Trade Center . " WILL THEY GET AWAY WITH IT ? FUNDING HARDENED criminals is a far more terrifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ineligible for technical support . But ironically , it 's the latter that will eventually lead to a crackdown on counterfeit and gray market crooks . While local law enforcement , customs officials , and the FBI are all taking software counterfeiting more seriously than in the past , they still look to software companies to alert them to counterfeiters . The firms get much of their information from users who call them after unknowingly buying pirated software . Tips from consumers are just the beginning . Software makers are working on technological solutions to allow copying only when it 's legal . They 're also working with the BSA , the SPA , and legislators to rewrite laws to make it easier to prosecute counterfeiters and impose harsher sentences . Microsoft 's Brad Smith is n't sure changing the law is enough . " What really worries me is not that the law is weak but that the profits that organized crime derives from counterfeiting are so great that fines and penalties are not a sufficient deterrent , " he explains . " There are people who are prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for them when they get out . We need a way to separate organized criminal operators from their money . " SPOTTING THE CONS WHAT ABOUT cracking down on those who sell pirated software to end users ? Investigators agree no one has the resources to arrest and convict the many distributors you encounter while bargain hunting . Even with such resources , proving a distributor is intentionally selling pirated software can be difficult . Software companies are working with Internet auction sites to stop sales of gray market and counterfeit software . According to Brad Handler , corporate counsel at EBay , a major online auction site , " We have a zero tolerance for piracy and fraud . We go to whatever lengths it takes to protect the licensee . " Both EBay and Yahoo Auctions told PC World they will pull any auction they discover is selling bogus goods . But sites rely on software firms and shoppers to identify those sales . So while software makers and law enforcement work to stop thieves from flooding the market with bogus goods , consumers must learn to recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice president of OEM sales for Corel , advises , " If these auction sites and other outlets are n't successful , they 'll stop . If customers think before they buy-call the software company 's piracy hot line and see if it 's legit-they can save themselves a lot of trouble and prevent this kind of crime . " Even if you think Bill Gates has enough money and does n't need more of yours , heed a warning from Detective Bembry about buying pirated software : " You are n't just hurting Microsoft . I know people do n't worry if Microsoft is out a few dollars . But I hope you do n't want to support organized crime .
