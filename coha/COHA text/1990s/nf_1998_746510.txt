In my recent book , John Dewey : America 's Philosopher of Democracy , I argue that John Dewey fails to give sufficient consideration to the problem of tyranny of the majority and even that his political thought contributes to that problem. ( n1 ) By tyranny of the majority I mean the undue control by the majority of people in a society over the thoughts and actions of dissenters , whether exercised by legal or informal means . Here I follow Alexis de Tocqueville , who famously gave us the phrase along with an analysis that was in places general and in other places specific to the United States of America . <p> Tocqueville observes several deleterious consequences that may follow from the omnipotence of a majority in a democratic society . In John Dewey I claim that Dewey fails to consider sufficiently three of those consequences : First , he does not guard against what Tocqueville calls the " legislative and administrative instability " that results from the power of the majority. ( n2 ) Second , his " instrumentalism " ( the term he prefers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote independence of thought . Third , and following from the previous point , he does not adequately counteract what Tocqueville terms " the courtier spirit , " the slavish devotion of citizens to the will of the majority. ( n3 ) <p> It is imperative , I believe , that we make every effort to understand Dewey as he understood himself before we criticize him . It might be objected that in that portion of my book I have not observed this principle because I rely heavily on Tocqueville 's analysis of tyranny of the majority . I see much merit and continuing relevance in Tocqueville 's analysis . But in the book I have perhaps paid insufficient attention to the possibility that Dewey has an alternative analysis of , or solution to , that problem . <p> The immediate fact that confronts us , however , is the absence in Dewey 's voluminous writings of much attention to the tyranny of the majority . In the index to the standard edition of Dewey 's collected works , few references to " majority rule " can be found , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n4 ) According to the index , Dewey made only one reference to Tocqueville in all of his published writings. ( n5 ) In this article , in which I hope to improve on my previous effort to evaluate Dewey 's solution to the problem of tyranny of the majority , I shall begin with what I find in those references . Dewey 's only reference to Tocqueville occurs in The Public and Its Problems ( published in 1927 ) , his fullest treatment of political theory . He writes there , <p> The strongest point to be made in behalf of even such rudimentary political forms as democracy has already attained , popular voting , majority rule and so on , is that to some extent they involve a consultation and discussion which uncover social needs and troubles . This fact is the greatest asset on the side of the political ledger . De Tocqueville wrote it down almost a century ago in his survey of the prospects of democracy in the United States . Accusing a democracy of a tendency to prefer mediocrity in its elected rulers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to folly , he pointed out in effect that popular government is educative as other modes of political regulation are not . It forces a recognition that there are common interests , even though the recognition of what they are is confused ; and the need it enforces of discussion and publicity brings about some clarification of what they are. ( n6 ) <p> In this passage Dewey may have in mind Tocqueville 's analysis of such aspects of American society as the New England town hall meeting and political and civil associations. ( n7 ) Tocqueville also praises the formal education provided to citizens in New England , but Dewey is not speaking of that here ; nor does Tocqueville emphasize it : " The citizen of the United States has not obtained his practical knowledge and his positive notions from books ; his literary education has prepared him to receive them but has not furnished them . " In the next paragraph Tocqueville continues , " It is by taking a share in legislation that the American learns to know the law ; it is by governing that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n8 ) <p> Democracy is educative , according to Tocqueville ; but that is not the whole story . Dewey does no better than allude to Tocqueville 's attack on democracy for squelching free discussion among citizens as well as encouraging it . When Dewey takes note of Tocqueville 's criticism of democracy for its " gusts of passion " and " openness to folly , " he does not do justice to Tocqueville 's remarks about freedom of thought and speech in America . Freedom of thought and speech , which one would think to be more secure and effective in a democracy than in another form of government , is actually less so , at least in America : " While the majority is in doubt , one talks ; but when it has irrevocably pronounced , everyone is silent , and friends and enemies alike seem to make for its bandwagon . " The cause of this is the moral authority vested in a majority in a democracy , which , combined with its visible power , produces a tyranny that " leaves the body alone " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Tocqueville concludes , " I know no country in which , speaking generally , there is less independence of mind and true freedom of discussion than in America , " and he makes the even stronger claim that " there is no freedom of the spirit in America . " This intellectual and spiritual homogeneity prevents indecent thoughts and the publication of indecent books . But it also prepares the way for a popular acceptance of " despotism . " Tocqueville warns against that : " Absolute monarchies brought despotism into dishonor ; we must beware lest democratic republics rehabilitate it , and that while they make it more oppressive toward some , they do not rid it of its detestable and degrading character in the eyes of the greatest number . " ( n9 ) So democracy is not only prone to " gusts of passion " and " folly " ; it is also liable to viewing despotism in a favorable light , if that despotism is backed by majority rule . <p> For Tocqueville " the absolute sovereignty of the will of the majority is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing outside the majority capable of resisting it . " ( n10 ) If Tocqueville is correct about the essence of democratic government , then the problem of the omnipotence of the majority is inherent in democracy . Dewey does not grant him that point , however . In 1949 , on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday ( when he was still engaged in his work ) , he observes that an intelligent politician once said ( in Dewey 's words ) that <p> majority rule is not the heart of democracy , but the processes by which a given group having a specific kind of policies in view becomes a majority . That saying has remained with me ; in effect it embodies recognition that democracy is an educative process ; that the act of voting is in a democratic regime a culmination of a continued process of open and public communication in which prejudices have the opportunity to erase each other ; that continued interchange of facts and ideas exposes what is unsound and discloses what may make for human well-being. ( n11 ) <p> Perhaps , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the process of communication . <p> Dewey 's other references to " majority rule " are found in the second edition of Ethics , a textbook he coauthored with James H. Tufts in 1932 . ( The first edition , published by Dewey and Tufts in 1908 , lacked these references . ) Ethics immediately presents a minor problem : Although we know the division of labor between Dewey and Tufts in the first edition , we have no such information for the second edition , and we do not know which author wrote the passages on majority rule . Yet each author signed his name to the entire work , so it is fair to conclude that the entire work represents the thought of both men . <p> In one passage Dewey and Tufts write , with striking similarity to Tocqueville : <p> The conception of majority rule , determined by counting of individual ballots has , to take only one example , tended to work out in the opposite direction to that which was anticipated . It rested upon a kind of quantitative individualism , but it often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that ideas uncongenial to the majority are discouraged and their expression not only frowned upon but often prevented by violence . The individualistic conception , summed up into the rule of a majority , has put a false value upon mere uniformity , and created to some extent jealousy of distinction , fear of the dissenter and non-conformist in social matters , a fear increased as population has become heterogeneous through immigration . The result is obviously adverse to progress except in technical and material lines , since cultural progress must always start from a minority . Many instances can be found where dependence upon the false individualistic theory has operated to repress and hamper individuality of thought and expression. ( n12 ) <p> Here the villain is the theory of individualism , which leads to a theory of democracy as the summation of individual desires expressed through majority rule , which in turns leads to the repression of opinions and actions opposed by the majority . <p> Dewey and Tufts present their solution several pages later : <p> A genuine democracy will always secure to every individual a maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will enable the minority by use of communication and persuasion to become a majority . The real culprit is always some powerful minority which prefers to use methods of suppressive force or of perversion and degradation of opinion by means of propaganda . . . . The responsibility of the actual majority is not for originating the suppression but for standing passively by and permitting it to occur . Any fair-minded survey of suppressive acts in this country will demonstrate that their ultimate source is always a privileged minority. ( n13 ) <p> The primary object of blame here is the " powerful " or " privileged minority , " which acts to prevent free communication , while the majority is only an accessory to the crime . <p> The main difficulty with the treatment of tyranny of the majority in Ethics is that Dewey and Tufts 's presentation of the solution does not seem to gibe with their presentation of the problem . The difficulty exists at two levels . <p> The first level of difficulty is that the former passage speaks of suppression of acts " uncongenial " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileged minority " as the main force . If it is true , as I find plausible , that majority tyranny occurs largely through the suppression of " ideas uncongenial to the majority , " how can it also be true that the majority is merely a passive accomplice to a " privileged minority " ? Would not the majority be likely to take a more active role ? If it is true instead that majority tyranny is ultimately rooted in an elite of some sort , why would that elite suppress only " ideas uncongenial to the majority " ? What guarantee would exist that the goals and interests of the elite coincide with those of the majority ? I do not see such a guarantee , nor do I see why the elite would suppress only those thoughts opposed by the majority . <p> The second level is another inconsistency . Is the " culprit " something as abstract as the individualistic way of thinking about politics , as Dewey and Tufts suggest in the first passage , or is it , more concretely , the privileged minority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not see a clear way to resolve the inconsistency at either level . Thus , in the remainder of this article , I shall return to the difference of opinion by Tocqueville and Dewey mentioned earlier . The important questions are as follows : First , which of the two ( if either ) is correct about the essence or heart of democratic government ? Is the essence " the absolute sovereignty " of majority will , or " the processes " by which a majority forms ? Second , whether or not Dewey is correct about that  --  but especially if he is  --  does he pay sufficient attention to those processes ? Third , does Dewey secure individual citizens or groups of minorities against the social pressure that leads to forced conformity ? THE ESSENCE OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT <p> Whereas Tocqueville refers to " the absolute sovereignty of the will of the majority , " Dewey refers to the process of reasoned communication by which a majority is formed . Tocqueville appeals to power and will ; Dewey , to persuasion and " intelligence " ( the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is correct , he has a solid claim to solve the problem of tyranny of the majority by transcending it : The problem should be expected never to arise if the essence of democratic government is unfettered communication , for an impure democracy can always be purified . <p> Americans in particular may want to side with Dewey here , since the Declaration of Independence puts at the foundation of any legitimate government " the Laws of Nature and of Nature 's God , " which are taken to be " self-evident " truths articulated by reason and not simply a matter of will . Power may be granted by will ( i.e. , consent ) , but its legitimacy is determined by reason . Nonetheless , the foundation of government and the essence of government are two different things . <p> We must note that Deweyan pragmatism does not strictly admit talk of " essences . " For Dewey that concept is so closely tied to an Aristotelian view of the universe that he believes it must be rejected when we see the full implications of the modern scientific approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can provide us with timeless knowledge of moral or political concepts any more than the natural sciences can yield knowledge of natural concepts . Nothing has a fixed essence , according to Dewey . What we call the " essence " or " nature " of anything is capable of change . <p> Then we may use Dewey 's word " heart " to ask what is fundamental to democratic government . Is Dewey correct to emphasize persuasion and communication and to de-emphasize will ? He clearly disdains social contract theory , which finds the origin of the state " in the meeting of the wills of individuals who come together and by contract or mutual pledging of loyalties bring a state into existence . " ( n14 ) The theory leads to the unacceptable view of laws of the state as commands from a superior will  --  even if that will is the will of " the people "  --  to inferior wills . Eventually " the question arises as to the justification of the will which issues commands . . . . The logical conclusion is that the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact the idea of authority is abolished , and that of force substituted . The next dialectical conclusion is that the will in question is something over and above any private will or any collection of such wills : is some overruling general will . ' " ( n15 ) <p> To stress communication instead , as Dewey does , is to put at the " heart " of the democratic process what might be seen as the central activity of democratic politics . For example , it is to view laws as " structures which canalize action ; they are active forces only as are banks which confine the flow of a stream , and are commands only in the sense in which the banks command the current . " ( n16 ) Laws do not define the terms of agreement among people but rather state the conditions within which people may decide on the terms , or within which they may be able to determine the consequences of their acting or failing to act in a particular way . Thus , according to Dewey , laws are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( n17 ) <p> It appears that Dewey 's well-known , thoroughgoing hostility to undemocratic aspects of society or government leads him to adopt a view of law that is contrary to common sense . How could it be reasonable to avoid seeing laws as commands from superior to inferior ? The Oxford English Dictionary ( second edition ) gives as the primary meaning of law " a rule of conduct imposed by authority . " The notion of authority implies superior and inferior . In American politics the superior authority , or sovereign , is sometimes said to be the people , which has its commands reflected in the U.S. Constitution , the fundamental law , while sometimes it is said to be the Congress , which issues commands in the form of laws . In both cases laws are commands from sovereign to inferior  --  from the people as sovereign to the government , or from the government as sovereign ( qua legitimate government ) to the people as subjects . In any other notion of law than Dewey 's of which I am aware , laws are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they are the current , the substance that gives content to political life and not merely the form that shapes it ( although they are the latter as well ) . <p> Admittedly , to hold law as command is not to say whether law should be identified with will or with reason . To answer that question is beyond the scope of this article . If Dewey is correct that law should be identified with reason or intelligence and not with will , he is partially correct about the heart of democratic government , for law must be at the heart of democratic government . <p> I do not see , however , how he can be more than partially correct . Even if law is fundamentally reason , democratic government still concerns power ; it is not merely about communication or persuasion . Communication is a feature of many organizations that are nonpolitical in nature , such as religious and economic groups . It is the existence of compulsion and force that marks off the government from other organizations . Indeed , a common definition of government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . <p> Perhaps Dewey would say that the " essence " of democratic government may change . If power has been at the heart of all government up to this point , we may still hope for an alteration . He does not make this statement , but it is in keeping with his rejection of fixed natures and his belief in the radically transformative possibilities of politics and human experience generally . But if this is his strongest case , I urge us to remain skeptical . For Dewey to say that the heart of democratic government is persuasion is akin to John Locke 's claim that toleration is the distinguishing mark of the true Christian church : Each statement represents a hope that we may have for the organization at its highest , but each statement is false. ( n18 ) The church is distinguished by the faith of its members in the God of the Bible , while democratic government is distinguished by a particular placement of legislative power . THE PROCESSES OF FORMING A MAJORITY <p> In a democratic society , according to Dewey , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that process that prevents a majority from becoming tyrannical in either a formal or an informal way . Does Dewey pay sufficient attention to the smaller processes that constitute that larger process ? <p> Those processes can be divided into two categories : educational and political . In short , my thesis is that Dewey devotes enough thought to the educational process but not enough to the political process . He is best known for his writings on education , of course , and they are permeated with his conviction that education has no higher purpose than development of a social sense . He puts the point more strongly : " Apart from the thought of participation in social life the school has no end nor aim . " ( n19 ) This concern with education ranges beyond his extensive theoretical and practical involvement with schools to other institutions : For example , he laments that the current state of industry detracts from the social sense . Rectification of this problem demands that adults be educated in initiative , independence , and inventiveness. ( n20 ) <p> For Dewey education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a method that involves cooperation and thus is friendly to democracy . " It is of the nature of science not so much to tolerate as to welcome diversity of opinion , while it insists that inquiry brings the evidence of observed facts to bear to effect a consensus of conclusions . . . . Freedom of inquiry , toleration of diverse views , freedom of communication , the distribution of what is found out to every individual as the ultimate intellectual consumer , are involved in the democratic as in the scientific method . " ( n21 ) Dewey 's educational theory emphasizes nothing more than scientific method as " the method of intelligence . " <p> Dewey 's notion of scientific method is that of a reflective process consisting of several steps : ( a ) " perplexity , " ( b ) " a conjectural anticipation , " ( c ) " a careful survey " of all considerations , ( d ) " elaboration of the tentative hypothesis to make it more precise and more consistent , " ( e ) acting on the hypothesis in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method culminates in the recognition that the conclusion reached about the hypothesis is inevitably tentative . Trained in this method from a young age , people will see that their future possibilities depend on the way in which others conduct their lives , hence they will willingly grant to others the most extensive liberties possible . Harmony of the individual with society is impossible without the construction of democratic " publics " modeled on a scientific community ; with such education , Dewey seems to think that harmonious integration is possible . <p> As I argue in my book , I doubt that Dewey 's educational methods will do all that he wants them to do ; I see his goal of harmonious integration of all people within society as a utopia . Although I would defend the amount of attention he gives to the educational process , he greatly raises expectations concerning what should come from education , and he does not follow through on the means to reach those ends . <p> For Dewey devotes scant attention to the political processes by which a majority forms . The Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alternative conception of liberalism to the individualism of Thomas Hobbes , John Locke , and others . In it Dewey introduces a term called " a public " ( a group of people affected by the consequences of a transaction ) , and he emphasizes the need for communication for the members of a public to recognize themselves as such ; but he says almost nothing about the ways in which or institutions by which the members of a public come to that recognition . Following the scientific method with its tentativeness , Dewey can say in other writings that no single method  --  including universal suffrage and majority rule  --  is inherently necessary for the attainment of democratic ends ; but he can not tell us what methods are most likely to work in the United States of America or in any other liberal democracy. ( n23 ) He advocates participatory democracy where possible without attacking representative democracy , but he does not suggest particular alterations in representative institutions . <p> Without dealing with institutional matters , Dewey can not provide a definite solution to the problem of tyranny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are not naturally selfish and can , with a certain kind of education , form a harmonious community . The school is a " social community " in miniature , he maintains throughout his life. ( n24 ) He prepares children for their places in the larger community , but apparently he expects well-educated citizens to design those institutions for themselves . Surely there are lessons that we can draw from the past that will help to guide us , even if we anticipate that our institutions will change over time . Yet Dewey does not write those lessons . It remains puzzling to me why , with all of the attention he gives to schools , he almost completely ignores political institutions . <p> Thus if Dewey is our only guide to the creation of a democratic society free from the threat of tyranny of the majority , the overall result of acting on his teaching will be heightened expectations , frustrated hopes , and , I fear , cynicism about the very possibility of the harmonious community he so desires . THE PREVENTION OF FORCED CONFORMITY <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups of citizens from pressure to conform to the majority 's views , we are asking about the soundness of his educational views . It is helpful to begin by examining Dewey 's definitions of two important terms : character and mind . More than once he defines character in social terms : In 1916 he says that " character and mind are attitudes of participative response in social affairs . " ( n25 ) In 1922 he writes , " Character is the interpenetration of habits " ; habits are social functions and " interpenetration " means , in effect , harmonization . A " strongO character , in Dewey 's view , is simply one where this " interpenetration " is " most marked , " or where harmonization is closest to being " total . " ( n26 ) <p> Mind and matter are " different characters of natural events , in which matter expresses their sequential order , and mind the order of their meanings in their logical connections and dependencies. " ( n27 ) Dewey objects to the view that mind is the property of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being can challenge the custom of a society , he says , if one begins by positing mind as something that exists within a single human being , unshaped by a society 's traditions and customs . " But the whole history of science , art and morals proves that the mind that appears in individuals is not as such individual mind . The former is in itself a system of belief , recognitions , and ignorances , of acceptances and rejections , of expectancies and appraisals of meanings which have been instituted under the influence of custom and tradition . " ( n28 ) In fact , according to Dewey , it is not so easy for a single person to break away from society 's custom as individualistic thinkers believe . If Dewey is correct , he offers a deeper explanation of the problem of tyranny of the majority than Tocqueville . <p> Dewey does not go so far as to say that it is impossible to distinguish between the mental powers of two people . But he does emphasize the impossibility of understanding the mental powers of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives . The individuality of any one person develops through a process of give-and-take with his fellows. ( n29 ) As we have seen , the experimentation that characterizes a well-ordered life involves a partial reliance on the views of others . The testing of the details of one 's own plan of life requires approval , or potential approval , of a significant number of one 's fellows " what we have seen Dewey call " a consensus of conclusions . " <p> Tyranny of the majority can be largely avoided , Dewey seems to say , with widespread adoption of the scientific method and the social sense that it fosters . If the goal is to prevent formal or informal coercion of a minority by a majority , more can be gained from a focus on educating the general public in scientific method than from an emphasis on cultivating a nonsocial  --  not to imply antisocial  --  genius in a relatively few people . Dewey suggests that the terms genius and originality are usually applied to an individual deviation from custom that can not be explained in any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether Dewey is correct , whether widespread scientific education is more valuable than the originality of a few in forestalling tyranny of the majority . That is a difficult question . A critical spirit among a citizenry will keep that citizenry ready to test a dominant opinion when the circumstances present themselves . But if the desired result is a " consensus of conclusions , " if the result of the test must be widely shared , how likely is it that the test would eradicate an unfounded or dangerous dominant opinion ? Would a minority likely be able to convince a majority to abandon that opinion ? <p> On the other hand , if we depend on the originality of a few , how much influence can iconoclastic individuals have over the thoughts and actions of a majority if there are very few of them ? They may be adept at avoiding the informal pressures to conform to the majority , but how can they hope to counteract the formal pressure , expressed through law and government ? <p> We might thus conclude that Dewey 's solution is more effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority , while an effort to promote " genius " and " originality " will do more to ward off social pressure . In a liberal society that trumpets individual rights , however , it seems to me that the latter is more crucial . For the purpose of solving this problem , it is more important to make room for and respect those few people whose thought  --  at least relatively speaking  --  has escaped the limitations of their time and place , than it is to insist on a scientific education for every citizen . If their thought can  --  absolutely speaking  --  transcend their time and place , then Dewey is incorrect to hold that a single mind is always " a system of belief , . . . instituted under the influence of custom and tradition . " Let us not dogmatically assume that such transcendence is an impossibility . <p> Up to this point we have assumed that science proceeds as Dewey thinks it does . But many of the greatest scientific achievements have come when at least one of the steps in the method mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not been fully tolerated , or when one person has worked alone . Moreover , as Dewey knows , science does not always operate for democratic ends. ( n31 ) Even when citizens want to achieve democratic ends , practical limitations may work to hurt minorities : Society can not test the worth of all of its opinions at once ; and deeply held , widespread opinions are likely to be the last ones to be tested , if they are tested at all . CONCLUSION <p> Although tyranny of the majority is not a problem to which Dewey devotes a great deal of attention , he is aware of it , as we have seen . If we can not completely accept his analysis of the problem without also accepting his historical relativism  --  the latter which I suggest in my book we should not do  --  he does at least raise important questions. ( n32 ) Particularly interesting is his claim that our individualistic way of thinking has led to a quantitative view of majority rule and " has put a false value upon mere uniformity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyranny of the majority , it is surprising that we do not see the argument made more prominently today  --  I have not seen it made at all  --  by those thinkers who may be labeled " communitarians . " Communitarianism is usually associated with majority rule and thus a possible danger to minorities ; so if a more communitarian democracy would remove that danger and benefit minorities more than liberal individualism does , it would appear that those thinkers should be quick so to argue . <p> Do liberal societies less characterized by individualistic thinking ( for example , Japan ) suffer less from the threat of tyranny of the majority than Western liberal democracies do ? The question is important , but even with an affirmative answer it is difficult to see that Western liberal democracies could change their way of thinking so drastically . Thus it seems to me that a reinforced liberal individualism supplies the best remedy to the problem . I see no better solution than that offered by Tocqueville : " Private people should be given certain rights and the undisputed enjoyment of such rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom , strength , and originality left to him . His position in face of society should be raised and supported . " ( n33 ) <p>
