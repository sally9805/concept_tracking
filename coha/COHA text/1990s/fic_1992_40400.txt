When John Wade was a boy of twelve , his hobby was magic . In the basement , where he practiced in front of a full-length mirror , he made his mother 's silk scarves change color . He cut his father 's tie with scissors and restored it whole . He placed a penny in the palm of his hand , made his hand into a fist , made the penny into a white mouse . This was not true magic ; it was trickery . But John Wade sometimes pretended otherwise , because he was a kid then , and because pretending was the thrill of magic , and because for a time what seemed to happen became a happening in itself . He was a dreamer . He liked watching his hands in the mirror , imagining how someday he would perform much grander magic , tigers becoming giraffes , beautiful girls levitating like angels in the high yellow spotlights  --  naked maybe , no wires or strings , just floating there . <p> At fourteen , when his father died , John did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night imagining a big yellow door , and after a few minutes the door would jerk open and his father would walk in and take off his hat and sit in a rocking chair beside the bed . " Well , I 'm back , " his father would say , " but do n't tell your mom  --  she 'd kill me . " He 'd wink and grin . " So what 's new ? " <p> And then they 'd talk for a while , quietly , catching up on things . Like cutting a tie and restoring it whole . <p> He met Kathy in the Autumn of 1967 . He was a senior at the University of Minnesota . She was a freshman . <p> The trick then was to make her love him and never stop . <p> The urgency came from fear , mostly . He did n't want to lose her . Sometimes he 'd jerk awake at night , dreaming she 'd left him , but when he tried to explain this to her , Kathy laughed and told him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any case thinking that way was destructive , it was negative and unhealthy . <p> John thought it over for several days . " You 're right , " he said , " but it still worries me . Things go wrong . Things do n't always last . " <p> " We 're not things , " she said . <p> " But it can happen . " <p> " Not with us . " <p> John shrugged and looked away . He was picturing his father 's white casket . " Well , maybe you 're right , " he said , " but how do we know ? People lose each other . " <p> In early December he began spying on he , He felt some guilt at first , which bothered him , but he also found a peculiar satisfaction in it . Like magic , he thought  --  a quick , powerful rush . He knew things he should n't know . Intimate little items : what she ate for breakfast , the occasional cigarette she smoked . Finesse and deception , those were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evenings he 'd station himself outside her dormitory , staring up at the light in her room ; later , when the light went off , he 'd patiently track her to the student union or the library or wherever else she went . The issue was n't trust or distrust . It was how the world was . He 'd sometimes make dates with her , and then cancel , and then wait to see how she used the time . He looked for signs of betrayal : the way she smiled at people , the way she carried herself around other men . In a way , he loved her best when he was spying ; it opened up a hidden world , with new perspectives and new things to admire . On Thursday afternoons he 'd stake out women 's basketball practice , watching from under the bleachers , taking quiet note of her energy and enthusiasm and slim brown legs . As an athlete , he decided , Kathy was n't much , but he got a kick out of the little war dance she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit made him proud ; she was a knockout in gym shorts . <p> Down inside , of course , John realized that the spying was n't proper , yet he could n't bring himself to stop . In part , he thought , Kathy had brought it on herself : she had a personality that lured him on . She was fiercely private . She was fiercely independent . They 'd be at a movie together , or at a party , and she 'd simply vanish ; she 'd go out for a pack of gum , or so she 'd say , and forget to return . It was n't thoughtlessness , exactly , but it was n't thoughtful either . Without reason , usually without warning , she 'd wander away while they were browsing in a shop or a bookstore , and a moment later , when he glanced up , she 'd be cleanly and absolutely gone , as if plucked off the planet . That fast  --  here , then gone  --  and he would n't see her again for hours , or until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library . All this put a little chill in his heart . He understood her need to be alone , to reserve time for herself , but too often she carried things to an extreme that made him wonder . <p> The spying helped . No great discoveries , but at least he knew the score . <p> And it was fun , too  --  a challenge . <p> Occasionally he 'd spend whole days just tailing her . The trick was to be patient , to stay alert , and he liked the bubbly sensation it gave him to trace her movements from spot to spot . He liked melting into crowds , positioning himself in doorways , anticipating her route as she walked across campus . It was sleight-of-body work , or sleight-of-mind , and over those cold winter days he was carried along by the powerful , secret thrill of gaining access to a private life . Hershey bars , for instance  --  Kathy was addicted , she could n't resist . He learned about her friends , her teachers , her little habits and routines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there in the drugstore when she bought her first diaphragm . <p> " It 's weird , " Kathy told him once , " how well you know me . " <p> " Well , that 's love , " he said . <p> " But I 'm still amazed . Sometimes I feel like we 're one person , almost . Like you can read my mind . " <p> John took her in his arms . " A miracle , " he said . <p> To his surprise , Kathy kept loving him , she did n't stop , and over the course of the spring semester they made plans to be married and have children and live in a big old house in Minneapolis . For John it was a happy time . Except for rare occasions , he gave up spying ; he was able to confide in her about his ambitions and dreams . First law school , he told her , then a job with the party , then maybe a run for the state senate , and then , when all the pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lieutenant governor , maybe . The U.S. Senate . He had the sequence mapped out ; he knew what he wanted . <p> Kathy listened carefully , nodding at times . Her eyes were green and smart , watchful . " Sounds fine , " she said , " but what 's it all for ? " <p> " For ? " <p> " I mean , why ? " <p> John hesitated . " Because  --  you know  --  because it 's what I want . " <p> " Which is what ? " <p> " Just the usual , I guess . Change things . Make things happen . " <p> Kathy lay on her back , in bed , frowning at the ceiling . It was late April of 1968 . She was eighteen years old . <p> " Well , I still do n't get it , " she said . " The way you talk , it sounds calculating or something . Too cold . Planning every tiny detail . " <p> " And that 's bad ? " <p> " No . Not exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She made a shifting motion with her shoulders . " I do n't know , it just seems strange , sort of . How you 've figured everything out , all the angles , except what it 's for . " <p> " For us , " he said . " I love you , Kath . " <p> " But it feels  --  I should n't say this  --  it feels manipulating . " <p> John turned and looked at her . Eighteen years old , yes , but something flat and skeptical condensed in her eyes , something terrifying . She returned his gaze without backing off . She was hard to fool . Again , briefly , he was struck by a sudden fear of losing her , of bungling things , and for a long while he tried to explain how wrong she was . Nothing sinister , he said . He talked about leading a good life , doing good things for the world . Yet even as he spoke , John realized he was not telling the full truth . Politics was manipulation . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He imagined placing a city in the palm of his hand , making his hand into a fist , making the city into a happier place . Manipulation , that was the fun of it . <p> He graduated in June of 1968 , there was a war in progress , which was beyond manipulation , and five months later he found himself at the bottom of an irrigation ditch south of Chu Lai . The much was waist-deep ; he could n't move . People were committing murder , other people were making odd huffing noises , and the trick then was not to die . <p> His letters from Kathy were cheerful and newsy , full of daily detail , and he found comfort in her chitchat about family and friends . She told funny stories about her sister , Pat , about her teachers and roommates and basketball team . She rarely mentioned the war . Though concerned for his safety , Kathy also had doubts about his motives , his reasons for being there . <p> " I just hope it 's not part of your political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead people , John , they do n't vote . " <p> The letter hurt him . He could n't understand how she could think such things . It was true , of course , that he sometimes imagined returning home a hero , looking spiffy in a crisp new uniform , smiling and waving at the crowds and carrying himself with appropriate decorum . And it was true , too , that uniforms got people elected . Even so , he felt abused . <p> " I love you , " he wrote back , " and I hope someday you 'll believe in me . " <p> He was not much of a soldier , barely competent , but he managed to hang on without embarrassing himself . He kept his head down under fire , avoided trouble , trusted in luck to keep him alive . By and large he was well liked among the men in Bravo Company . In the evenings , after the foxholes were dug , he 'd sometimes perform card tricks for his new buddies , simple stuff mostly , and he liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spades into the Queen of Hearts , the Queen of Hearts into a snapshot of Ho Chi Minh . The guys were impressed . Sorcerer , they called him : " Sorcerer 's our man . " And for John Wade , who had always considered himself a loner , the nickname was like a special badge , an emblem of belonging and brotherhood , something to take pride in . A nifty sound , too  --  Sorcerer . It suggested certain powers , certain rare skills and aptitudes . <p> The men in Bravo Company seemed to agree . <p> In January , when a kid named Henderson got shot through the stomach , John knelt down and pressed a towel against the hole and said the usual things : " Hang tight , easy now . " Henderson nodded . For a while he was quiet , flickering in and out , and then suddenly he giggled and tried to sit up . <p> " Hey , no sweat , " he said , " I 'm aces , I 'm golden . " He kept rocking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zip , man , no sweat at all . " <p> Then his eyes shut . He almost smiled . <p> " Go on , " he said . " Do your magic . " <p> In Vietnam , where superstition governed , there was the fundamental need to believe  --  believing just to believe  --  and over time the men came to trust in Sorcerer 's powers . Jokes , at first . Little bits of lingo . " Listen up , " somebody would say , " tonight we 're invisible , " and after a second somebody else would say , " That 's affirmative , Sorcerer 's got this magic dust , gon na sprinkle us good , gon na make us into spooks . " It was a game they played . Partly tongue in cheek , partly hopeful . At night , before heading out on ambush , the men would go through the ritual of lining up to touch Sorcerer 's helmet , filing by as if at communion , the faces dark and young and solemn . They 'd ask his advice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his incredible good luck , how he never got a scratch , not once , not even that time back in December when the mortar round dropped right next to his foxhole . Amazing , they 'd say . Man 's plugged into the spirit world . <p> John encouraged the mystique . It was useful , he discovered , to cultivate a slightly reserved demeanor , to stay silent for long stretches of time . When pressed , he 'd put on a quick display of his powers , doing a trick or two , maybe offering a vague prophecy of things to come . " Wicked vibes , " he 'd say , " wicked day ahead , " and then he 'd shake his head and gaze out across the paddies . He could n't go wrong . Wickedness was everywhere . <p> " I 'm the company witch doctor , " he wrote Kathy . " These guys listen to me . They actually believe in this shit . " <p> Kathy did not write back for several weeks . And then she sent only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess , but be careful with the hocus-pocus . One of these days you 'll make me disappear . " <p> The card was signed " Kath . " There were no endearments , no funny stories . <p> Instantly , John felt the old terrors rise up again , all the ugly possibilities . He could n't shut them off ; even in bright daylight the pictures kept blowing through his head . Dark bedrooms , for instance . Kathy 's diaphragm . What he wanted was to spy on her again  --  the wanting was almost a craving  --  but all he could do was wait . At night his blood seemed to bubble . He could n't stop wondering . In the third week of February , when a letter finally arrived , he detected a new coolness in her tone , a new distance and formality . She talked about a movie she 'd seen , an art gallery she 'd visited , a terrific Spanish beer she 'd discovered . His imagination filled in the details . <p> March was a wretched month . Kathy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost to land mines ; a third was shot through the neck ; Henderson died in the hospital . <p> And the pressures did not let up . In the middle of the month Bravo Company was choppered into a string of hamlets in the densely wooded foothills northwest of Chu Lai  --  a spooky area , full of ghosts  --  and morale was low . As they plodded from village to village , the men talked in low voices about how the magic had worn off , how Sorcerer had lost contact with the underworld . They seemed to blame him . Nothing direct , just a general standoffishness . There were no more requests for tricks . No banter , no jokes . As the days piled up , John felt increasingly cut off from the men , cut off from Kathy and his own future . A stranded sensation  --  he felt totally lost . At times he wondered about his mental health . The internal terrain had gone blurry ; he could n't get his bearings . <p> " Something 's wrong , " he wrote Kathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not blind  --  Sorcerer can see . " <p> She wrote back fast : " You scare me . " <p> And then for many days he received no letters at all , not even a postcard , and the war kept squeezing in on him . The notion of the finite took hold and would not let go . <p> In the second week of April a lieutenant named Reinhart was shot dead by sniper fire . He 'd been eating a candy bar . He fell in the grass under a straggly old palm tree , his lips dark with chocolate . The day was bright and humid , very hot , but John Wade found himself shivering . The cold came from inside him . A deep freeze , he thought , and then suddenly he felt something he 'd never felt before , a force so violent it seemed to pick him up by the shoulders . It was rage , in part , but it was also humiliation and illness and despair , all kinds of things . <p> For a few seconds he hugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He made no real decision . He 'd lost touch with his own body , his own sense of volition , and in the hours afterward he would remember how he seemed to glide toward the enemy position  --  not running , just a fast , winging , disconnected glide  --  circling in from behind , not thinking at all , slipping through a tangle of deep brush and keeping low and letting the glide take him up to a little man in black trousers and a black shirt . He would remember the man turning . He would remember their eyes colliding . Certain other things he would remember only dimly : how he was carried forward by the glide , how his lungs seemed full of ashes , how at one point his rifle muzzle came up against the man 's cheekbone . At that instant his memory would go wet and red . He would feel an immense pressure in his stomach ; he would see Kathy 's flat eyes reproaching him for the many things he had done and not done ; he would review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  fourteen years old , and scared , and wearing a necktie and a new white shirt ; he would smell the terrible flower smells ; he would remember his mother weeping , the minister saying words that made him want to search for his father in the pews and aisles as if for a lost nickel . At his right shoulder he felt a fierce shaking . He heard no sound at all , none that he would remember , and everything was wet and red . <p> Afterward the guys in Bravo Company could n't stop talking about Sorcerer 's new trick . <p> They went on and on . <p> " Poof , " one of them said . " No lie , just like that  --  poof ! " <p> At dusk they dragged the sniper 's body into a nearby hamlet . An audience of villagers was summoned at gunpoint . A rope was then secured to the dead man 's feet , another to his wrists , and just before nightfall Sorcerer and his assistants performed an act of levitation , hoisting the body high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floated under a fiery red moon . <p> John returned home in November of 1970 . At the Seattle airport he put in a long-distance call to Kathy but then chuckled and hung up on the second ring . <p> The flight to Minneapolis was lost time . Jet lag , maybe , but something else , too . He felt dangerous . In the gray skies over North Dakota he went back into the lavatory , where he took off his uniform and put on a sweater and slacks , and then carefully appraised himself in the mirror . His eyes looked unsound . A little tired , a little frayed . After a moment he winked at himself . " Hey , Sorcerer , " he murmured . " How 's tricks ? " <p> In the Twin Cities that evening he took a bus over to the university . He carried his duffel to the plaza outside Kathy 's dorm , found a concrete bench , and sat down to wait . It was shortly after nine o'clock . Her window was dark , which seemed appropriate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the various places she might be , the things she might be doing . Nothing wholesome came to mind . His thoughts then gathered around the topics he would address once the occasion was right . Loyalty , for example . Steadfastness and love and fidelity and trust and all the related issues of sticking power . <p> By midnight he 'd worked himself up . He was yelling in his head , half dizzy , and he almost missed her when she turned up the sidewalk to her dorm . <p> She carried a canvas tote bag over her shoulder , a sack of groceries in her right arm . She 'd lost some weight , mostly at the hips , and in the dark she seemed to move with a quicker , nimbler , more impulsive stride . It made him uneasy . After she 'd gone inside , John sat very still for a time , not quite there , not quite anywhere ; then he picked up his duffel and walked the seven blocks to a hotel . <p> He was still gliding . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exotic fevers swept through his blood ; he could n't get traction on his dreams . Twice he woke up and stood under the shower , letting it beat against his shoulders , but even then the dream-reels kept unwinding . Crazy stuff : Kathy shoveling rain off a sidewalk ; Kathy waving at him from the wing of an airplane . At one point , near dawn , he found himself curled up on the floor , wide awake , conversing with the dark . He was asking his father to please stop dying . Over and over he kept saying please , but his father would n't stop , he just kept dying , and so then a hard , killing rage rose up . He was fourteen years old again  --  the funeral , the necktie pinching tight  --  and he wanted to kill everybody who was crying and everybody who was n't . He wanted to kill the minister . He wanted to kill the choir and the skinny old lady at the organ . He wanted to kill the flowers . He wanted to grab a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dying . But he felt helpless ; he did n't know where to start . After the service , while his mother slept , he 'd gone down into the basement and practiced magic in front of the full-length mirror , making white mice disappear , reading minds that were no longer present , performing miracles of love and healing . <p> Now he felt only coldness . <p> When dawn came , he hiked over to Kathy 's dorm and waited on the concrete bench . He was n't sure what he wanted . <p> Around ten o'clock she came out and headed toward the classroom buildings . The routine had n't changed . He followed her to the biology lab , then to the student union , then to the post office and bank and gymnasium . From his old spot under the bleachers he watched as she practiced her dribbling and free throws , which were much improved , and after lunch he spent a monotonous three hours in the library as she leaned over a fat gray psychology textbook . Nothing out of the ordinary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending his vigil  --  just grabbing her , holding tight and never letting go . But near dark , when she closed her book , he could n't resist tailing her across campus to a busy kiosk , where she bought a magazine , and then to a pizza joint on University Avenue , where she ordered a Tab and a small pepperoni . <p> He stationed himself at a bus stop outside . His eyes ached , and his heart , too  --  everything . Beneath all that , though , he felt the dull pain of indecision , a kind of puzzlement , a moral fatigue . At times he was struck by a fierce desire to believe that the suspicion was nothing but a demon in his head . Other times he wanted to believe the worst . He did n't know why . It was as though something inside him  --  his genes or his bone marrow  --  required the certainty of a confirmed betrayal : a witnessed kiss , a witnessed embrace . The facts would be absolute . In a dim way , only half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love her , and to go on loving her , yet somehow the ambiguity of it all seemed intolerable . Nothing could ever be certain , not if he spied forever , because he would always face the threat of tomorrow 's treachery , or next year 's treachery , or the treachery implicit in all the years beyond that . <p> Besides , he liked spying . He was Sorcerer . He had the gift , the knack . <p> It was full dark when Kathy stepped outside . She passed directly behind him , so close he could smell the soaps and oils on her skin . Just briefly , he felt a curious jolt of guilt , almost shame , but for another ten minutes he tracked her back toward campus , watching as she paused to inspect the shop windows and Thanksgiving displays . At the corner of University and Oak she used a public telephone , mostly listening , laughing once ; then she continued up toward the school . The evening had a crisp , leafy smell . Football weather , a cool mid-autumn Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids and lovers going arm in arm . Nobody knew . Their world was safe . All promises were infinite , all things endured , doubt was on some other planet . Neptune , he thought , which gave him pause . When he looked up , Kathy was gone . <p> For a few moments John had a hard time finding focus . He scanned the sidewalks , shut his eyes briefly , and then turned and made his way back to her dorm . <p> He waited all night . He waited through dawn and into early morning . <p> By then he knew . <p> The knowledge was absolute . It was bone-deep and forever  --  pure knowing  --  but even so he waited . He was still there when she came up the sidewalk around noon . Arms folded , powerful , he stood on the steps and watched her move toward him . <p> They married anyway . <p> It was an outdoor ceremony , in the discreetly landscaped yard of her family 's house in a suburb west of the Twin Cities . Balloons had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was decorated with Japanese lanterns and red carnations and crepe paper . Altogether , things went nicely . The minister talked about the shield of God 's love , which warded off strife , and then recited  --  too theatrically , John thought  --  a short passage from First Corinthians . Oddly , though , it was not the solemn moment he had once imagined . At one point he glanced over at Kathy and grinned . " And though I have the gift of prophecy , and understand all mysteries , and all knowledge "  --  her eyes were green and bright . She wrinkled her nose . She grinned back at him  --  " and though I have all faith , so that I could remove mountains ... " A lawnmower droned a few houses down . A light breeze rippled across the yard , and spikes of dusty sunshine made the trees glow , and pink and white balloons danced on their little strings . " For now we see through a glass , darkly ; but then face to face : now I know in part ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known . " <p> Then the minister led them through their vows . <p> They promised to be true to each other . They promised other things , too , and exchanged rings , and afterward Kathy 's uncle opened the bar . Her mother gave them bed sheets . Her father presented them with the keys to an apartment in Minneapolis . <p> " It 's scary , " Kathy whispered , " how much I love you . " <p> They drove away in a borrowed Chevy , to the St. Paul Ramada , where they honeymooned for several days on a package deal . The secrets were his . He would never tell . On the second morning Kathy asked if he had any misgivings , any second thoughts , and John shook his head and said no . He was Sorcerer , after all , and what was love without a little mystery ? <p> They moved into the apartment just after Easter . <p> " We 'll be happy , " Kathy said . " I know it . " <p> John laughed and carried her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard his advantage . He would go from year to year without letting on that there were tricks . <p>
