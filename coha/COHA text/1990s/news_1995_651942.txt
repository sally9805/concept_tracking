<p> It is a staple of American politics that there is very strong support for the death penalty ; in opinion polls , roughly 70 percent consistently favor it . Yet the popular will on this issue has been thwarted . <p> To be sure , we have many capital trials , convictions and death sentences ; we have endless and massively costly appeals ; and a few people do get put to death every year . But compared to the number of death sentences , the number of executions is minuscule , and the gap is widening fast . <p> In 1972 , the Supreme Court struck down all existing death penalty statutes and emptied the nation 's death rows . Almost immediately , states began passing death penalty laws to comply with the Court 's reinterpretation of the Eighth Amendment . Since then , more than 5,000 men and a handful of women have been given the death sentence ; about 2,000 of those sentences have been set aside ; fewer than 300 have been carried out . The reasons are complex , but they boil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case law reflects an uneasy accommodation between the will of the popular majority , who favor capital punishment , and the objections of a much smaller  --  but ferociously committed  --  minority , who view it as a barbaric anachronism . <p> Assuaging death penalty opponents , the Court has devised a number of extraordinary safeguards applicable to capital cases ; but responding to complaints that these procedures were used for obstruction and delay , it has also imposed various limitations and exceptions to these safeguards . This pull and tug has resulted in a procedural structure  --  what Justice Harry A. Blackmun called a " machinery of death "  --  that is remarkably time-consuming , painfully cumbersome and extremely expensive . No one knows precisely how large a slice of our productive resources we force-feed to this behemoth , but we can make some educated guesses . To begin with , while 80 to 90 percent of all criminal cases end in plea bargains , capital cases almost always go to trial , and the trials are vastly more complex than their noncapital counterparts . If the defendant is sentenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal courts for years , sometimes decades . The Robert Alton Harris case , for example , found its way to the California Supreme Court six times ; it was reviewed in Federal district court on five occasions and each time it was appealed to the Ninth Circuit . The U.S. Supreme Court reviewed the case once on the merits , though on five other occasions it considered and declined Mr. Harris 's request for review . Before Mr. Harris was executed in 1992 , his case was reviewed by at least 30 judges and justices on more than 20 occasions over 13 years . State and local governments pay for the prosecution as well as for the defense team  --  which consists of at least two lawyers and a battery of investigators and experts ; much of this money is spent even if the defendant eventually gets a lesser sentence . California reportedly spends $90 million a year on the death penalty . Once the case gets into Federal court , the United States starts picking up the defense tab , and the sums can be daunting . In one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than $400,000 , which did n't include the appeal or petition to the Supreme Court . Our own estimate is that death cases , on the average , cost taxpayers about a million dollars more than their non-capital counterparts . With 3,000 or so inmates on death row , to paraphrase Senator Everett Dirksen , pretty soon you get into real money . <p> Another significant cost is the burden on the courts . More than a quarter of the opinions published by the California Supreme Court from 1987 to 1993 involved death penalty cases . Since capital appeals are mandatory while appeals in other cases are discretionary , much of this burden is borne by other litigants who must vie for a diminished share of that court 's attention . Estimating the judicial resources devoted to a capital case in the Federal courts is difficult , but a fair guess would be 10 times those in other cases . Perhaps the most significant cost of the death penalty is the lack of finality . Death cases raise many more issues , and far more complex issues , than other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewed with more vigor in the courts . As a result , fully 40 percent of the death sentences imposed since 1972 have been vacated , sometimes 5 , 10 or 15 years after trial . One worries about the effect on the families of the victims , who have to endure the possibility  --  often the reality  --  of retrials , evidentiary hearings and last-minute stays of execution for years after the crime . What are we getting in return ? Even though we devote vast resources to the task , we come nowhere near executing the number of people we put on death row , and probably never will . We sentence about 250 inmates to death every year but have never executed more than 40 . Just to keep up with the number of new death row inmates , states would have to sextuple the pace of executions ; to eliminate the backlog , there would have to be one execution a day for the next 26 years . This reality moots much of the traditional debate about the death penalty . Death penalty opponents have certainly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public remains firmly committed to capital punishment . Nor have opponents won the moral battle : most of us continue to believe that those who show utter contempt for human life by committing remorseless , premeditated murder justly forfeit the right to their own life . Other arguments against the death penalty also fall flat . For example , the fear that an innocent person may be convicted also applies to noncapital cases ; no one , after all , can give back the 20 years someone wrongfully spends behind bars . Our system is therefore heavily geared to give the criminal defendant the benefit of the doubt . Wrongfully convicted defendants are rare ; wrongfully convicted capital defendants are even rarer . The case where the innocent defendant is saved from the electric chair because the one-armed man shows up and confesses happens only in the movies . Death penalty opponents are winning the war nevertheless . Unable to stop the majority altogether , they have managed to vastly increase the cost of imposing the death penalty while reducing the rate of executions to a trickle . This trend is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to double or triple the resources we devote to the death penalty , even if we could put all other civil and criminal cases handled by the state and Federal courts on the back burner , it would be to no avail . <p> The great stumbling block is the lawyers : the jurisprudence of death is so complex , so esoteric , so harrowing , this is the one area where there are n't nearly enough lawyers willing and able to handle all the current cases . In California , for example , almost half the pending death penalty appeals  --  more than 100  --  are on hold because the state ca n't find lawyers to handle them . We are thus left in a peculiar limbo : we have constructed a machine that is extremely expensive , chokes our legal institutions , visits repeated trauma on victims ' families and ultimately produces nothing like the benefits we would expect from an effective system of capital punishment . This is surely the worst of all worlds . <p> Only two solutions suggest themselves , one judicial and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Supreme Court 's death penalty jurisprudence . This is unlikely to happen . Over the last quarter-century , the Court has developed a substantial body of case law , consisting of some four score opinions , premised on the proposition that death is different and we must exercise extraordinary caution before taking human life . As we learned a few years back in the area of abortion , conservative justices are reluctant to reverse such major constitutional judgments . A political solution may be no easier to achieve , but it 's all we have left . The key to any such solution lies with the majority , precisely those among us who consistently strive for imposition of the death penalty for an ever-widening circle of crimes . <p> The majority must come to understand that this is a self-defeating tactic . Increasing the number of crimes punishable by death , widening the circumstances under which death may be imposed , obtaining more guilty verdicts and expanding death row populations will do nothing to insure that the very worst members of our society are put to death . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry out 30 , 40 , maybe 50 executions a year , but that we can not  --  will not  --  carry out one a day , every day , for the foreseeable future . Once that reality is accepted , a difficult but essential next step is to identify where we want to spend our death penalty resources . Instead of adopting a very expansive list of crimes for which the death penalty is an option , state legislatures should draft narrow statutes that reserve the death penalty for only the most heinous criminals . Everyone on death row is very bad , but even within that depraved group , it 's possible to make moral judgments about how deeply someone has stepped down the rungs of Hell . Hitler was worse than Eichmann , though both were unspeakably evil by any standard ; John Wayne Gacy , with two dozen or so brutal deaths on his conscience , must be considered worse than John Spenkelink , who killed only once . Differentiating among depraved killers would force us to do some painful soul-searching about the nature of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , it would mean that in a world of limited resources and in the face of a determined opposition , we will sentence to death only those we intend to execute . Second , it would insure that those who suffer the death penalty are the worst of the very bad  --  mass murderers , hired killers , airplane bombers , for example . This must be better than loading our death rows with many more than we can possibly execute , and then picking those who will die essentially at random . <p> Third , a political solution would put the process of accommodating divergent viewpoints back into the political arena , where it belongs . This would mean that the people , through their elected representatives , would reassert meaningful control over the process , rather than letting the courts and chance perform the accommodation on an ad hoc , irrational basis . <p> It will take a heroic act of will for the majority to initiate a political compromise on this emotionally charged issue . But as with democracy itself , the alternatives are much worse .
