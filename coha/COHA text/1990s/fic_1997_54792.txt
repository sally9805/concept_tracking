for Margaret <p> At the edge of a river and the end of a road , a blue-eyed boy lived with his mother and five sisters . The women sewed wedding gowns for every girl from every town . But not one of the river woman 's daughters made a dress for herself . They were too plain , too fat , too thin , too tall . A cruel joke , the mother said , because her rosy boy was too pretty for his own good . <p> The sisters loved him well . They played with him when he was small . Dressed him like a doll in lace and silk . Then one day the river woman caught him pissing in the yard . Just like your father , she said , locking the door . From four windows four sisters chanted , Dirty boys ca n't sleep in our house . The youngest sister felt sorry for her little brother and tossed him a plastic bag packed with nuts and bread , three coins , and the boy 's go-to-church clothes . <p> Run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow . <p> This boy was five years old . <p> The first day he ate the bread and nuts . The second day he bought tobacco and learned to smoke . On the third day he stuffed his good suit with paper and threw it in the river to watch it float . For a long time he stood on the bank , waving goodbye to his old self . <p> For weeks , the boy walked town to town , begging quarters , sleeping in barns . Sometimes a kind woman let him wash himself under a hose . One gave him raisins and a cup of broth . One gave him a straw hat to shade his pretty face from the sun . One gave him rope to cinch his pants , which had grown too large and kept falling down . All these women gave their pity , and the pity of women weighed in him like a belly full of stones . <p> At night they were afraid . <p> At night they latched their windows tight and bolted all their doors . <p> Wild boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They thought he was the wolf , but he felt the air pass through his hands and the rain wash through his bones . He wanted to tell them , I 'm nothing but a ghost . <p> One day , the boy met a man of God . The man said , I do n't have much , but with you , my son , I will share all I own . The good man 's wife washed the filthy boy . Cut his yellow nails . Clipped his matted curls . He saw the ring of scum he left in her porcelain tub , a gray outline of himself . He saw his long locks , coiled like snakes on the bathroom floor . <p> When the man and wife tucked the boy into his featherbed , they kissed his fingers and his nose . They said , We love you already . You 're our beautiful child now . <p> But he was afraid of what he 'd lost : ring of silt , sharp nails , twisted curls . He thought these pieces were another boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he 'd watched his good self drown . <p> In the morning , the dean boy discovered that the wife had stayed awake all night to sew him a suit of perfect clothes . The blue shirt was made of silk , the thread of spun gold . The pants were black and tough , the kind that never tore . He told himself he must be good and happy in these clothes . <p> Still , there was a hole he could n't fill . His belly was the bear . It growled and growled . Each day he rose hours before dawn to eat alone . He devoured bags of cookies , swilled down quarts of milk . Handful by handful , gulp by gulp , he tried to feed the bear fast enough to keep it still . Soon the skinny boy grew puffed and slow . The too-tight perfect clothes lay folded in a drawer , and the boy wore hand-me-downs . Never again did the good wife wash him , though she complained about his smell . <p> Then , a miracle ! On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swaddling clothes . This was the true son come at last , the one his wife had waited for . <p> This baby spoke no words , told no lies , cried hardly at all . This child had no teeth . Every day , a simple girl with swollen breasts came to feed him of herself . <p> One night the woman whispered to the man , How can we make the wrong one go ? <p> Big boy , he frightened them . When he rocked the baby 's cradle , he rocked too hard . The woman said , He has eyes like the coyote . Someday he 'll eat my baby whole . <p> Her voice was soft , but these words slipped under the door and down the hall ; they whirled into the boy 's ear , hissing in his skull . His chest burned , full of live coals . He wanted to smash a window , throw the baby out . His hands twitched . His hands said , Now . He clasped them tight to make them stop . He was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but still a human heart . He saw what the man and wife did not : the baby 's head was big , but the baby 's brain too small . <p> He could n't sleep another night in that bed soft as a cloud . The man of God kept a gun in the closet . The good wife kept a carving knife in the kitchen drawer . The gun told the boy , I love noise . The knife said , I love your throat . <p> Before he left , the boy turned every picture to the wall . Since it was almost winter , he stole a pair of leather boots with leather soles , a down jacket , a wool scarf . He stole the precious letters the man and wife kept sealed in a secret box . That night he burned them in a vacant lot . That night he warmed his hands as he watched the words of love go up in smoke . When he poked the cinders with a stick , they crumbled like his heart of coal . <p> Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods , curled in a hollow in the ground . Pines swayed . Their highest limbs were strung with stars . Sticks and rocks tore his jacket . All the feathers floated out . Day by day his body consumed itself . He became a scavenger , eater of fish heads and beetles , pig ears and chicken hearts  --  anything he could catch , anything people who were still people threw out . As his flesh shrank tight , he saw how his pelvis curved . When he touched his tiny ribs , he wanted to snap each bone . <p> The bear in the belly made the boy break glass and walk through walls . Everything he stole , he lost . The woods were full of children , thieves like him , little wolves . He covered himself with leaves and dirt . He was always cold . Sometimes the leaves pretended to be hands fondling him in the dark . <p> One evening at dusk , a strange , pale child appeared in the woods . His coat was covered with stiff white hairs , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree and hole to hole , telling all the missing ones that he knew a woman who would let them sleep by her little fire , safe in her little house . But nobody believed him . They disguised themselves as roots and stones . <p> Buried in the dirt , the boy thought , Maybe this stranger has a slender knife inside his coat , Maybe he 's come to kill me for my leather boots though the leather soles are thin as paper now . Then he saw that the pale creature was not a human boy at all . He was a white deer bounding through the trees , leaving only tracks in snow . <p> The boy followed . When it grew too dark to see , he crawled . At last he saw a candle flickering in a tarpaper shack at the edge of town . Inside , a hunched woman with yellowish skin fed sticks to a pot-bellied stove . He knocked at the window and she opened her door . She was n't afraid ; she did n't scold . When he tore half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jam . She said , Eat all you want , there 's more . <p> The woman with olive skin was very ugly and very old . <p> He knew the story of the gingerbread house . So what , he thought , let her fatten me up . When she asks to feel my fingers , I 'll give her chicken bones . <p> But she was n't that witch . She taught him how to talk again , how to use a knife and fork . She tried to teach him words on the page , but they swirled in his head like wind-whipped snow . They buzzed and cursed . Books made the boy so furious , he ripped the pages out . Sometimes he fed them to the pot-bellied stove . Sometimes he ate them himself . <p> If he raged enough by day , by night he might grow calm . The clean sheets of his tiny bed were cool against his skin and smooth as silk . They made him remember a blue shirt from long ago . They made him remember piles of wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his filth . Nights like those , he sat in the tub for hours , scratching at his skin until he had no smell . <p> The woman kept a jar of coins in the cupboard . Each month she 'd go to town . On the day the boy turned sixteen , she told him she 'd spent their last coin . He found a job repairing roads . The old woman said he was the man of the house . But curled in his little bed , the boy heard a wailing sound , a child far away , the baby with the brain too small , or just his long-lost self . If he cried too hard , his real mother came , the first one , the one who kicked him out . He dreamed himself delicate as a doll in frilly clothes . Mother 's big hands gripped like claws . Mother shook his shoulders till his silly whimpering stopped . <p> Every morning he forgot . But once he knocked the old woman against a wall , called her an ugly witch , told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Afterward he laid his head in her lap and sobbed . She forgave him , of course . She loved him more than she loved herself . <p> For her sake , the boy worked hard , though he despised the sticky heat and smell of tar . Dizzy one day , he leaned against his shovel and saw a watery mirage , a swarm of white locusts , thousands of tiny winged women dressed in wedding gowns . The foreman never had liked this boy . The foreman said , You 're fired . You work too goddamn slow . Later the boy could n't recall how the other man ended up in the gravel . He did n't remember a silver knife slitting the man 's shirt . Did n't hear the knife say , I could open your bowels . <p> All night the boy lay shivering , wrapped in a wool blanket and dressed in all his clothes . The old woman said , They could send you to prison , you know . <p> He hid in the forest . He thought , I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman followed him . The woman begged him to come home . She said , I 'll take care of you forever . I ca n't bear to be alone . <p> Strong as a man , this boy stayed a child in the woman 's house . She was an old old woman now . She took a job scrubbing toilets and floors . Each day she looked more like a witch . Her hair grew coarse as wires . Her dark teeth fell out . <p> The boy told himself she was a beautiful princess snared by a wicked charm . If he could break the spell , she 'd be a lovely girl . The magic jar would fill itself with gold . One night she drank sweet wine till she passed out . Like a lover , the boy closed his eyes and kissed her wrinkled mouth . But the old drunken woman with seven teeth refused to be transformed . <p> He loathed her then , her shriveled breasts , her brittle bones . He slapped her face until she woke . He said , Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you die , I 'll be the one alone . <p> She said , You remind me of myself She said , I was hungry all my life , and cold . <p> They wept together then . They drank till they were blind . They laughed and swore . All the glasses jumped from the shelves . All the bottles shattered on the floor . The boy and the old woman kissed each other 's mouths . The old woman and her only love fell asleep in each other 's arms . <p> Why do I tell this story ? <p> The boy was my lover , if you want to know . The woman died , and the boy followed me until I took him home . He told me this story . I believed his sorrow and his hunger made him more human and more whole . Vain fool , I thought I could love him as the woman loved . I spoke her words . I said , You remind me of myself <p> But I lied . I knew nothing of their world . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once on a mountain and once in an ocean , I nearly froze . But I never slept night after night in a hole . On playgrounds and in fields I tackled little boys and pinned them to the ground . It 's true . Once I slammed a two-hundredten-pound man against a wall . With my fingernails and teeth I 've drawn blood from my sister 's arms . But I have never held the cold blade to another 's flesh and heard the knife say , I could open your bowels . <p> One night we fought . It does n't matter why . Some silly thing . I do n't remember now . <p> Later , he thought I was asleep and touched me in the dark . This terrified me more than anything else . More than curses on the stairs , clenched fists , the threat of broken bones . His hands were cool as metal between my thighs . He whispered that he loved me , but I heard other words hammering in my skull . His fingers spoke . They said , We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands slipped inside my body . They said , We could scoop you out . In absolute silence his veins said , Washed in your warm blood , we will be clean . Darling , they said , with your bright blood at last we will be filled . <p> <p> By MELANIE RAE THON <p>
