<p> When they realized they were having their third kid , Lauri and Jim Pantos swallowed hard and accepted reality : It was time to buy a minivan . <p> They 'd traded up from their Gaithersburg town house to a new single-family home in Germantown . He commuted to work ; she was a stay-at-home mom . They lived near Wal-Mart . All the signs pointed in one direction  --  it was time to cross the last threshold , to become one with suburbia . <p> " This is totally not the image we saw of ourselves , " Lauri says , giving the familiar **31;418;TOOLONG refrain that rings through every subdivision . <p> " It felt like the total suburbanite cave-in . " <p> Yet last December they bought a green 1998 Plymouth Grand Voyager . And  --  reluctant and resigned  --  they joined the club . <p> " I was the only person I knew who did n't have a minivan , " she says . " I 'd go to the preschool and the parking lot was filled with minivans and 4-by-4s . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore . " <p> After their purchase , she says , the angst subsided . In an eerie way . " I was the norm , " she says . " I fit in with everyone . " <p> Nothing puts parents on the analyst 's couch like the ubiquitous multiple-seated , sliding-doored hauler of soccer teams and bulk groceries . If the self-delusion associated with buying one had a name in psychology journals , it would be " minivan denial . " <p> One can resist the minivan and all it stands for . One can struggle . One can postpone . But only for so long . <p> As Americans , we attach great meaning to our vehicles . Some of those meanings are complex enough to carry multiple connotations . A BMW , for instance , can announce a driver 's prosperity  --  or over-financed attempt to look prosperous . But the minivan  --  for those who fear it  --  has one , immutable meaning : <p> Giving in . <p> Giving in to children : Finally , irreversibly admitting your life is no longer just about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to the suburbs : For attitudinal city dwellers , the suburbs are about bailing out , going soft , conforming . Many suburbanites worry about the same things . If they can just avoid buying the minivan , they think , they can avoid complete homogenization . <p> In a larger sense , minivans are about giving in to honesty : Admitting you 're probably never going to trek through Tibet . Instead , the treks you 'll take will be across soggy Saturday morning soccer fields in Laurel and mall parking lots in Springfield , environments the minivan was designed to rule . <p> Larger still , they are about giving in to getting older , middle-age sag and spread ; and eventually , yes , death . A minivan is a one-way portal through which there is no return , like those barriers at car rental garages : " Warning : Backing up will cause severe tire damage ! " <p> And giving in , for some men , to a form of nonsurgical but public emasculation . Each time you drive the thing . <p> Jim Pantos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grand Voyager . But , he admits , that 's mostly because his wife was going to drive it most of the time . He commutes to his software design job in Rockville in a manly Ford Explorer . <p> " I 'd joked with her that if the minivan were going to be my car , I 'd have some more serious issues with it , " he says . <p> " He 'd say , ' I 'm not driving to work in a minivan , ' " Lauri Pantos , 34 , says . " He was joking , but he was serious , too . " <p> Don Wharton , on the other hand , had some really serious problems with buying a minivan . Until he found one with optional running boards and a spoiler . <p> He and wife Bobbi , both 37 , are planning a family . Strollers . Playpens . Car seats . Moreover , Wharton is a pet food salesman who travels extensively . That 's a lot of time away from his Silver Spring home hauling a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honda Accord and a weekend play car , a teal 1993 Thunderbird with spoiler , T-top and 10-disc CD changer . Now , with a kid on the way , both cars seem too small on the inside . Time to get big . <p> For a long time , Don advocated a sport utility vehicle , or , in auto parlance , a sport-ute . <p> " I wanted a man-size car , " he says . Not a Ford Windstar minivan , like one of his friends has . " I called it a ' Sissystar , ' " he says , laughing . <p> He 's not laughing as much since he had his head turned by one monster-looking Sissystar . <p> " There was a Windstar at an auto show that had aluminum rims and had running boards on it . And you could get a spoiler , too , " he says , dreamily . " I could actually be seen in it . My buddies would say , ' Hey , that 's pretty spiffy . ' " <p> On the Manliness Scale , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every other minivan gets a 3 . " <p> If he can trick up the minivan sufficiently , he says , he 'll be able to delude himself enough to drive it . For instance , he saw an accessory console that fits between the driver 's and passenger 's seats that accommodates a small TV and VCR . <p> " On long trips , you can put in ' The Firm ' or ' The Hunt for Red October , ' " he says . Guy paradise : On the road , driving a boss ride , with a submarine movie playing idly in the background . <p> Still , he fears , he 'll look like " every other mommy van coming down the road . " <p> Which is why he has been fighting so hard for a Dodge Durango , the latest entry into the crowded sport-ute field . It is large . It has four-wheel drive . It has a muscular V-8 engine and fender flares . But he 's not hopeful , given that it costs more than $ 30,000 and he can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less resigned to owning a minivan . But he has to get something in return . <p> " It 's been a major process to fight to save the T-bird as my sports car . I 'll keep it under a cover and still have some bit of macho left , something I can actually squeal the tires in , " he says . " I 'm clinging desperately to my last bastion of masculinity . " <p> If it 's any consolation , Wharton should note that Car and Driver magazine wrote of the van : " For the record , partygoers will appreciate that we fit 74 empty beer cases in our Windstar . " <p> Everybody In ! <p> Minivan sales rocketed through the ' 80s and early ' 90s after Chrysler filled a gaping , hitherto-unknown market void with the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager in 1983 . Chrysler still dominates the field with 45 percent of all minivan sales ( the Dodge Caravan is the most popular , with more than 300,000 sold last year ) . And , even though minivan sales have leveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of market saturation and partially because of sport-utes , hailed as a tonic for the minivan blahs  --  the minivan is still the quintessential suburban vehicle , much like its predecessor , the station wagon . <p> The station wagon , it should be noted , served the same role as the minivan and likewise identified an earlier generation 's occupants as certifiable suburbanites . For them , the subdivision was an aspiration , the fake-wood Town and Country a status symbol . <p> Yet their children heap scorn upon their minivans . Why ? The answer is probably boomer-based : Their reluctance to admit they 're grown-ups . No generation , it seems , clings harder to its youth . And perhaps the greatest reminder of one 's mortality is one 's children . One ca n't say  --  or even think  --  " I wish I had n't had you kids because you make me feel old "  --  but one can hate the thing you drive them around in . The minivan , therefore , has become a rich anxiety reservoir  --  and whipping boy  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's amazing how much baggage you can pack into a minivan . <p> A Family Tree <p> Remember when vans were groovy ? <p> In the ' 70s , full-size panel vans  --  the minivan 's progenitor  --  were rolling , swinging sex dens just large enough to hold a twin-size mattress . Inside , they were plush caves  --  floors , walls and ceilings lined with shag carpeting , outfitted with swiveling captain 's chairs , eight-tracks and fur-covered steering wheels . Outside , they were interstate-going murals , with fantastical airbrushed paintings of crashing ocean waves or auburn Western sunsets or impossibly proportioned women . The final touch was the bumper sticker on the back : " If This Van Is A-Rockin ' , Do n't Come A-Knockin . " Vans were even elegized in the ' 70s hit " Chevy Van " by Sammy Johns : <p> She 's gon na love me in my Chevy van <p> And that 's all right with me <p> Even though the van and minivan are near relatives , they are , psychologically , light-years apart . Here , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by comedian Sean Morey and set to the tune of Steppenwolf 's " Magic Carpet Ride " : <p> I like to dream <p> That I still fit in my old jeans . <p> Well , I 'm a partying machine <p> But I go to bed at 8:15 <p> Well , I am still a wild man <p> So why do n't you come with me , little girl , <p> In my magic minivan ? <p> It is said that cars are an extension of our personalities . Often it is truer that they are an extension of the personality we 'd like to be . We accessorize with cars the way we do with clothing , jewelry and even mates , playing dress-up like children . We are rarely honest enough to buy the sort of car that really fits our personality . Otherwise , there would be a lot more Delta 88s on the road . And , quite possibly , minivans . <p> Car salesmen know better than anyone else the crucial mating of vehicle and owner personality . Talk to minivan salesmen and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the identity crises right there on their showroom floors . <p> Ed Dunn , a sales manager at Fitzgerald Colonial Dodge on Rockville Pike , had one couple recently contemplating a Caravan and a Durango . Among the Dodge family , this is a common choice : Even though it 's quite likely that suburbanite Durango owners are n't going to do any four-wheeling in West Virginia , at least they can tell themselves they have n't bought a minivan . It can be argued that much of the appeal of sport-utes is not what they are but what they are not  --  minivans . <p> The couple test-drove the Caravan and Durango . Though they preferred the Durango , it did n't have the interior space they needed . The Caravan did . In fact , the Caravan satisfied most of their requirements . But they just . . . could n't . . . do it . <p> " She said , ' I ca n't see myself in it . It 'll make me like my mom , ' " Dunn says . In the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But there 's another side to the story , salesmen and minivan owners say . Once customers buy a minivan  --  once they yield to its power  --  they keep buying them , auto surveys show . Turns out , the minivan , er , um , happens to meet most of their needs . <p> Another couple came into Fitzgerald and told salesman Chuck Scott they needed a minivan . <p> " I 'm buying this for the family , " the man stated imperiously . " I do n't want to have anything to do with a minivan . I drive an Acura . " <p> A few months later , Scott saw the same man bring said minivan in for an oil change . <p> " You 're not going to believe this , " he told Scott . " I like this better than the Acura . My wife is driving the Acura . " <p> Indeed , there is an admirable honesty among those who have reconciled themselves to the minivan . People like Tracey King , 33 , who lives in Gaithersburg with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When they bought their white 1996 Dodge Caravan , her husband got the requisite jibes from his golfing buddies . But so what ? <p> " There 's the whole stigma about moving into middle life and having children , " she says of minivan-deniers . " I guess they think they 're not hip anymore . <p> " But I do n't care what people think , " she continues . " I drive a minivan , I 'm a stay-at-home mom with two children and it 's good . I do n't know why everyone perceives that as a negative . That 's the good part of life . " <p> Which is exactly how the execs at Chrysler hope their product will be perceived  --  not as the last resort but as the answer to lives that change with age . <p> " People that do n't own a minivan look at the stereotypical idea of it being for a soccer mom and they speak of it in negative terms , " says David Bostwick , director of corporate market research for Chrysler Corp . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why do n't they get a life ? ' But if you talk to a minivan owner , they say , ' This is life . Life is very complex and there are a lot of demands and we 're going to adapt to it . ' " <p> Women have fewer problems owning minivans , Bostwick says , because  --  unlike fathers  --  mothers tend to form their lives and schedules around the needs of their children . The children need a vehicle " they can be picked up in , change clothes in and be taken to the next activity in , " he says , and the minivan is it . <p> Then , Bostwick waxes large on the topic of minivans . <p> Committing to a minivan " is a little bit like getting married . It 's a little scary like having a baby , " he says . " When you step into a different stage in your life , it 's not always an active move , sometimes it 's more of an acceptance . When you get on the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted it . ' " <p> Honda , which owns a tiny slice of the minivan market with its Odyssey , is trying an in-your-face TV ad targeted at people who believe they have n't accepted anything . And will never have to . <p> The 30-second spot shows a young , affluent couple in a smartly decorated house . A baby can be heard gurgling in the background . <p> She ( sarcastically ) : " Have you seen Dave 's new car ? " <p> He : " Yeah , I 've seen Dave 's new car . " Pause . " I was thinking maybe we could get a minivan . " <p> She : Uproarious , sustained laughter . <p> Voice-over : " If the word ' minivan ' scares you , just say ' Odyssey , ' from Honda . " <p> Researchers at Rubin Postaer &; Associates , the California agency that created the ad , came up with the acknowledge-the-phobia tack after conducting interviews with Odyssey and Caravan owners . What they found were two groups that perceive themselves very differently though they own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they make " conscious lifestyle decisions , " says Heidi Vail , a vice president at Rubin Postaer . For Caravan owners , " life just happened to people . All of a sudden , they woke up and they have two or three kids and they have to survive . <p> " Also , Odyssey owners are more likely to socialize with other adults and look for time with themselves , not just with their kids , " she notes . Caravan owners " felt that once you have kids , life is all set for you and you have no more choices . " <p> Odyssey owners , she says , believe they are the captains of their lives , not castaways clinging to a lifeboat with three seats and sliding doors . <p> " Odyssey owners do n't want to be stigmatized , " she says . Unlike , presumably , Caravan owners , who do n't mind . <p> Case Study <p> Somewhere between the naked honesty of a Caravan person and the self-delusion of an Odyssey person lies , perhaps , Ilisa Bernstein : policy adviser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chevrolet Blazer , which can almost be called a truck . She would strap her windsurfing board to the roof , head down to Cape Hatteras and ride the waves . " I fit in nicely down there , " she says . <p> But four years ago , she and her husband , David , had twins . <p> Enter the minivan . <p> " I got totally sucked into the advertising on TV for the van with the automatic sliding door , " she says of her green 1994 Pontiac Transport . " I imagined myself with twins and my hands full with bags of groceries and I told my husband , ' I want the car that has that button that automatically opens the door . Soon . ' " <p> But there was one thing she did n't anticipate : How the minivan would fit in at Hatteras , among the windsurfers . <p> " When we got the minivan , we got rid of the Blazer and I had to go down there with my mommy van , " she says . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vans there , but not minivans . " Bummer . <p> Worse , perhaps , when she and her husband were at home in Wheaton , they were social outsiders as well , thanks to the minivan . <p> " Nobody I knew had a minivan . None of my friends imagined themselves as minivan drivers . We were the first , " she says . Then she adds , laughing , but with a hint of genuine isolation : " I could n't talk to anybody about it ! " Now , she says , everyone comes to them for minivan advice . Great . Just what you want to be known as  --  the minivan expert . <p> Four years after buying hers , she 's come to terms with it . Sort of . <p> " My view is that as soon as the kids are old enough , " meaning when her 4-year-olds no longer require car seats , strollers and so on , " I 'm going buy another sport utility vehicle , " she says , one like her oft-mourned Blazer . <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I can kind of see the end of road , " she says . " I 'll get back to a sport utility someday . " <p> Right . That 's probably what they all say .
