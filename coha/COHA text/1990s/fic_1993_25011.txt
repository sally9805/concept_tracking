 | Cargo was discharged and loaded all during the night . In the morning with all passengers and crew members aboard , the Vargaz threw off moorings , hoisted sail and glided back out into the Draschade Ocean . The Vargaz sailed north under the bleak Kachan coast . On the first day a dozen Wankh keeps appeared ahead , passed abeam and were left in the haze astern . On the second day the Vargaz passed in front of three great fjords . From the last of these a motor galley plunged forth , wake churning up astern . The captain immediately sent two men to man the blast-cannon . The galley cut through the swells to pass behind the cog ; the captain instantly put about and brought the cannon to bear once more . The galley swung away and off to sea , with the jeers and hoots from the men aboard coming faintly across the water . A week later Dragan , first of the Isles of Cloud , appeared on the port beam . On the following day the cog put into Wyness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange-haired daughters disembarked . Traz looked wistfully after them . Edwe turned and waved ; then the family was lost to sight among the yellow silks and white linen cloaks of the dockside crowd . Two days the cog lay at Wyness , unloading cargo , taking on stores and fitting new sails ; then the lines were thrown off and the cog put to sea . With a brisk wind from the west the Vargaz drove through the chop of the Parapan . A day passed and a night and another day , and the atmosphere aboard the Vargaz became suspenseful , with all hands looking east , trying to locate the loom of Charchan . Evening came ; the sun sank into a sad welter of brown and gray and murky orange . The evening meal was a platter of dried fruit and pickled fish , which no one ate , preferring to stand by the rail . The night drew on ; the wind lessened ; one by one the passengers retired to their cabins . Reith remained on deck , musing upon the circumstances of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of orders ; the main yard creaked down the mast and the Vargaz lost way . Reith went back to the rail . Through the dark glimmered a shine of far lights : the coast of Cath . p 201 DAWN REVEALED A low-lying shore , black against the sepia sky . The mainsail was hoisted to the morning breeze ; the Vargaz moved into the harbor of Vervodei . The sun rose to reveal the face of the sleeping city . To the north tall flat-faced buildings overlooked the harbor , to the south were wharves and warehouses . The Vargaz dropped anchor ; the sails rattled down the mast . A pinnace rowed out with lines and the Vargaz was heaved sternfirst against a dock . Port officials came aboard , consulted with the captain , exchanged salutes with Dordolio and departed . The voyage was at an end . Reith bade the captain goodbye and with Traz and Anacho went ashore . As they stood on the dock Dordolio approached . He spoke in an offhand voice . " I now take my leave of you , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to Dordolio 's motives , Reith asked : " The Blue Jade Palace is at Settra ? " " Yes , of course . " Dordolio pulled at his mustache . " You need not concern yourself in this regard ; I will convey all necessary news to the Blue Jade Lord . " " Still , there is much that you do not know , " said Reith . " In fact , nearly everything . " " Your information will be of no great consolation , " said Dordolio stiffly . " Perhaps not . But surely he will be interested . " Dordolio shook his head in sad exasperation . " Quixotic ! You know nothing of the ceremonies ! Do you expect simply to walk up to the Lord and blurt out your tale ? Crassness . And your clothes : unsuitable ! Not to mention the marmoreal Dirdirman and the nomad lad . " " We must trust to the courtesy and tolerance of the Blue Jade Lord , " said Reith . " Bah , " muttered Dordolio . " You have no shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . He said , " You definitely plan to visit Settra then ? " " Yes , of course . " " Accept my advice . Tonight stop at one of the local inns  --  the Dulvan yonder is adequate  --  then tomorrow or the next day visit  | a reputable haberdasher and put yourself into his hands . Then , suitably clothed , come to Settra . The Travelers ' Inn on the Oval will furnish you suitable accommodation . Under these circumstances , perhaps you will do me a service . I seem to have misplaced my funds , and I would be obliged to you for the loan of a hundred sequins to take me to Settra . " " Certainly , " said Reith . " But let us all go to Settra together . " Dordolio made a petulant gesture . " I am in haste . Your preparations will consume time . " " Not at all , " said Reith . " We are ready at this moment . Lead the way . " Dordolio scanned Reith from head to toe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for our mutual comfort , is to see you into respectable clothes . Come along then . " He set off along the esplanade toward the center of town . Reith , Traz and Anacho followed , Traz seething with indignation . " Why do we suffer his arrogance ? " " The Yao are mercurial folk , " said Anacho . " Pointless to become disturbed . " Away from the docks the city took on its own character . Wide , somewhat stark , streets ran between flat-faced buildings of glazed brick under steep roofs of brown tile . Everywhere a state of genteel dilapidation was evident . The activity of Coad was absent ; the few folk abroad carried themselves with self-effacing reserve . Some wore complicated suits , white linen shirts , cravats tied in complex knots and bows . Others , apparently of lesser status , wore loose breeches of green or tan , jackets and blouses of various subdued colors . Dordolio led the way to a large open-fronted shop , in which several dozen men and women sat sewing garments . Signaling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reith , Anacho , and Traz entered and waited while Dordolio spoke energetically to the bald old proprietor . Dordolio came to confer with Reith . " I have described your needs ; the clothier will fit you from his stock , at no large ex-pense . " Three pale young men appeared , wheeling racks of finished garments . The proprietor made swift selection , laid them before Reith , Traz , and Anacho . " These I believe will suit the gentlemen . If they would care to change immediately , the dressing rooms are at hand . "  | Reith inspected the garments critically . The cloth seemed a trifle coarse ; the colors were somewhat raw . Reith glanced at Anacho , whose reflective smile reinforced his own assumptions . Reith said to Dordolio : " Your own clothes are the worse for wear . Why not try on this suit ? " Dordolio stood back with eyebrows raised high . " I am satisfied with what I wear . " Reith put down the garments . " These are not suitable , " he told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you work from . " " As you wish , sir . " Reith , with Anacho watching gravely , looked through a hundred or so color sketches . He pointed to a conservatively cut suit of dark blue . " What of this ? " Dordolio made an impatient sound . " The garments a wealthy vegetable grower might wear to an intimate funeral . " Reith indicated another costume . " What of this ? " " Even less appropriate : the lounge clothes of an elderly philosopher at his country estate . " " Hm . Well then , " Reith told the clothier , " show me the clothes a somewhat younger philosopher of impeccable good taste would wear on a casual visit to the city . " Dordolio gave a snort . He started to speak but thought better of it and turned away . The clothier gave order to his assistants . Reith looked at Anacho with an appraising frown . " For this gentleman , the traveling costume of a high-caste dignitary . " And for Traz : " A young gentleman 's casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those ordered out by Dordolio . The three changed ; the clothier made small adjustments while Dordolio stood to the side , pulling at his mustache . At last he could no longer restrain a comment . " Handsome garments , of course . But are they appropriate ? You will puzzle folk when your conduct belies your appearance . " Anacho spoke scornfully . " Would you have us visit Settra dressed like bumpkins ? The clothes you selected hardly carried a flattering association . " " What does it matter ? " cried Dordolio in a brassy voice . " A fugitive Dirdirman , a nomad boy , a mysterious nonesuch : is it not absurd to trick such folk out in noblemen 's costume ? " Reith laughed ; Anacho fluttered his fingers ; Traz turned Dordolio a glance of infinite disgust . Reith paid the account .  | " Now then , " muttered Dordolio , " to the airport . Since you demand the best , we shall charter an air-car . " " Not so fast , " said Reith . " As usual you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to reach Settra . " " Naturally , " said Dordolio with a sneer . " But folk who dress like lords should act like lords . " " We are modest lords , " said Reith . He spoke to the clothier . " How do you usually travel to Settra ? " " I am a man with no great regard or ' place ' ; * I ride the public wheelway . " Reith turned back to Dordolio . " If you plan to travel by private air-car , this is where we part . " " Gladly ; if you will advance me five hundred sequins . " Reith shook his head . " I think not . " " Then I also must travel by wheelway . " As they strode up the street Dordolio became somewhat more cordial . " You will find that the Yao set great store by consistency , and a harmony of attributes . You are dressed as persons of quality , no doubt you will conduct yourselves in consonance . Affairs . will adjust themselves . " At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a short while later a long car trundled up to the platform , riding a wedge-shaped concrete slot on two great wheels . The four entered a compartment , seated themselves on red plush chairs . With a lurch and a grind , the car left the station and trundled off into the Cath countryside . Reith found the car intriguing and somewhat of a puzzle . The motors were small , powerful , of sophisticated design ; why was the car itself so awkwardly built ? The wheels  --  when the car reached top speed , perhaps seventy miles an hour  --  rode on cushions of trapped air , at times with silken smoothness , until the wheels came to breaks in the slot , whereupon the car jerked and vibrated abominably . The Yao , reflected Reith , seemed to be good theoreticians but poor engineers . The car rumbled across an ancient cultivated countryside , more civilized than any Reith had yet seen on Tschai . A haze An untranslatable word : the quality a man acquires in greater or lesser extent by the brace of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragile , almost frivolous , equilibrium between a man and his peers , instantly disturbed by a hint of shame , humiliation , embarrassment . p 205 hung in the air , tinting the sunlight antique yellow ; shadows were blacker than black . In and out of forests rolled the car , beside orchards of gnarled black-leaved trees , past parks and manors , ruined stone walls , villages in which only half the houses seemed tenanted . After climbing to an upland moor , the car struck east over marshes and bogs , to outcrops of rotting limestone . No human being was in sight , though several times Reith thought to discern ruined castles in the distance . " Ghost country , " said Dordolio . " This is Audan Moor ; have you heard of it ? " " Never , " said Reith . " A desolate region , as you can see . The haunt of outlaws , even an occasional Phung . After dark the night-hounds bell ... " Down from Audan Moor rolled the wheelway car , into a countryside of great charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , brown and rust-colored trees . On small islands stood tall houses with high-pitched gables and elaborate balconies . Dordolio pointed off to the east . " See yonder , the great manse in front of the forest ? Gold and Carnelian : the palace of my connections . Behind  --  but you can not see  --  is Halmeur , an outer district of Settra . " The car swung through a forest and came out into a region of scattered farmsteads with the domes and spires of Settra on the sky ahead . A few minutes later the car entered a depot and rolled to a halt . The passengers alighted , and walked to a terrace . Here Dordolio said : " Now I must leave you . Across the Oval you will find the Travelers ' Inn , to which I recommend you and where I will send a messenger with the sum of my debt . " He paused and cleared his throat . " If a freak of destiny brings us together in another setting  --  for instance , you have evinced a somewhat unrealistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it might serve our mutual purposes were we not to recognize each other . " " I can think of no reason for wanting to do so , " said Reith politely . Dordolio glanced at him sharply , then made a formal salute . " I wish you good fortune . " He walked off across the square , his strides lengthening as he went . Reith turned to Traz and Anacho . " You two go to the Travelers ' Inn , arrange for accommodations . I 'm off to the Blue Jade 206 0 JACK VANCE Palace . With any luck I 'll arrive before Dordolio , who seems in a peculiar state of haste . " He walked to a line of motorized tricycles , climbed aboard the first in line . " The Blue Jade Palace , with all speed , " he told the driver . The mechanism spun off to the south , past buildings of glazed brick and dim glass panes , then into a district of small timber cottages , then past a great outdoor market , a scene as brisk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turning aside , the motor-buggy nosed across an ancient stone bridge , through a portal in a stone wall into a large circular plaza . Around the periphery were booths , for the most part unoccupied and barren of goods ; at the center a short ramp led up to a circular platform , at the back of which rose a bank of seats . A rectangular frame occupied the front of the platform , of dimensions which Reith found morbidly suggestive . " What is this place ? " he asked the driver , who gave him a glance of mild wonder . " The Circle , site of Pathetic Communion , as you can see . You are a stranger in Settra ? " " Yes . " The driver consulted a yellow cardboard schedule . " The next event is Ivensday , when a nineteen-score comes to clarify his horrible desperation . Nineteen ! The most since the twenty-two of Agate Crystal 's Lord Wis . " " You mean he killed nineteen ? " " Of course ; what else ? Four were children , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All Settra will come to the expiation . If you 're still in town you could hardly do more for your own soul 's profit . " " Probably so . How far to Blue Jade Palace ? " " Through Dalmere and we 're almost there . " " I 'm in a hurry , " said Reith . " As fast as possible . " " Indeed sir , but if I wreck or injure , I 'll feel extraordinary shame , to my soul 's sickness , and I would not care to risk despon-dency . " " Understandable . " The motor-buggy spun along a wide boulevard , dodging and veering to avoid potholes . Enormous trees , black-trunked with brown and purple-green foliage , overhung the way ; to either side , shrouded in dark gardens , were mansions of the most ex-  | traordinary architecture . The driver pointed . " Yonder on the hill : Blue Jade Palace . Which entrance do you favor , sir ? " He inspected Reith quizzically . " Drive to the front , " said Reith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your lordship . Although most of the fronters do n't arrive in three-wheel motor-buggies . " Up the driveway rolled the vehicle , and under a porte cochere the buggy halted . Paying the fare , Reith alighted upon a silken cloth laid under his feet by a pair of bowing footmen . Reith walked briskly through an open arch into a room paneled with mirrors . A myriad prisms of crystal hung tinkling on silver chains . A majordomo wearing russet velvet livery bowed deeply . " Your lordship is at home . Will you rest or take a cordial , though my Lord Cizante impatiently awaits the privilege of greeting you. , , " I will see him at once ; I am Adam Reith . " " Lord of which realm ? " " Tell Lord Cizante that I bring important information . " The majordomo looked at Reith uncertainly , his face twisting through a dozen subtle emotions . Reith understood that already he had committed gaucheries . No matter , he thought , the Blue Jade Lord will have to make allowance . The majordomo signaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good enough to come this way . " Reith was taken into a small court murmuring to a waterfall of luminous green liquid . Two minutes passed . A young man in green knickers and an elegant waistcoat appeared . His face was wax pale , as if he never saw sunlight ; his eyes were somber and brooding ; under a loose four-corner cap of soft green velvet his hair was jet black : a man richly handsome , by some extraordinary means contriving to seem both effete and competent . He examined Reith with critical interest , and spoke in a dry voice . " Sir , you claim to have information for the Blue Jade Lord ? " " Yes . Are you he ? " " I am his aide . You may impart your information to me with assurance . " " I have news relating to the fate of his daughter , " said Reith . " I prefer to speak to the Blue Jade Lord directly . " The aide made a curious mincing motion and disappeared . Presently he returned . " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Follow me , if you will . " He took Reith into a wainscoted room enameled a brownish ivory , lit by a dozen luminous prisms . At the far end stood a frail frowning man in an extravagant eight-piece suit of black and purple silk . His face was round , dark hair grew down his forehead in an elflock ; his eyes were dark , far apart , and his tendency was to glance sidelong . The face , thought Reith , of a secretive suspicious man . He examined Reith with a compression of the lips . " Lord Cizante , " said the aide , " I bring you the gentleman Adam Reith , heretofore unknown , who , chancing past , was pleased to learn that you were in the vicinity . " There was an expectant silence . Reith understood that the circumstances demanded a ritual response . He said , " I am pleased , naturally , to find Lord Cizante in residence . I have only this hour arrived from Kotan . " Cizante 's mouth tightened , and Reith knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cizante spoke in a crisp voice . " Indeed . You have news regarding the Lady Shar Zarin ? " This was the Flower 's court name . Reith responded in a voice as cool as Cizante 's own . " Yes . I can give you a detailed account of her experiences , and her unfortunate death . " The Blue Jade Lord looked toward the ceiling and spoke without lowering his eyes . " You evidently claim the boon ? " The majordomo entered the room , whispered to the aide , who discreetly murmured to Lord Cizante . " Curious ! " declared Cizante . " One of the Gold and Carnelian scions , a certain Dordolio , likewise comes to claim the boon . " " Send him away , " said Reith . " His knowledge of the matter is superficial , as you will learn . " " My daughter is dead ? " " I am sorry to say that she drowned herself , after an attack of psychic malaise . " The Lord 's eyebrows rose more sharply than before . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . " " When and where did this take place ? " " Three weeks ago , aboard the cog Vargaz , halfway across the Draschade . " Lord Cizante dropped into a chair . Reith waited for an invita- p 209 tion to do likewise , but thought better of seating himself . Lord Cizante spoke in a dry voice : " Evidently she had suffered deep humiliation . " " I could n't say . I helped her escape from the Priestesses of the Female Mystery ; thereafter she was secure and under my protection . She was anxious to return to Cath and urged me to accompany her , assuring me of your friendship and gratitude . But as soon as we started eastward she became gloomy , and , as I say , halfway across the Draschade she threw herself overboard . " While Reith spoke Cizante 's face had shifted through phases and degrees of various emotions . " So now , " he said in a clipped voice , " with my daughter dead , after circumstances I do not care to imagine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reith said coldly , " I knew then and know nothing now of this ' boon . ' I came to Cath for several reasons , the least important of which was to make myself known to you . I find you indisposed to what I consider civilized standards of courtesy and I will now leave . " Reith gave a curt nod and started for the door . He turned back . " If you wish to learn further details regarding your daughter , consult Dordolio , whom we found stranded at Coad . " Reith left the room . The Lord 's sibilant murmur reached his ears : " You are an uncouth fellow . " In the hall waited the majordomo , who greeted Reith with the faintest of smiles . He indicated a rather dim passageway painted red and blue . " This way , sir . " Reith paid him no heed . Crossing into the grand foyer , he left the way he had come . 7 REITH WALKED BACK toward the Oval , pondering the city Settra and the curious temperament of its people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a small spaceboat , which in far-off Pera had appeared at least feasible , now seemed impractical . He had expected gratitude and friendship from the Blue Jade Lord ; he had encountered hostility . As to the technical abilities of the Yao , he was inclined to pessimism , and he fell to appraising the vehicles which passed along the street . They appeared to function satisfactorily , though giving the impression that flair and el-  | egance , rather than efficiency , had been first in the minds of the designers . Energy derived from the ubiquitious power cells produced by the Dirdir ; the coupling was not altogether quiet : an indication , so Reith considered , of careless or incompetent engineering . No two were alike ; each seemed an individual construc-tion . Almost certainly , reflected Reith , the Yao technology was inadequate to his purposes . Without access to standard components , maxima-minima sets , integrated circuit blocks , structural forms , computers , Fourier analyzers , macro-gauss generators , a thousand other instruments , tools , gauges , standards , not to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crudest spaceboat became a stupendous task ? impossible in a single lifetime . . . He came to a small circular park , shadowed under tall psillas with shaggy black bark and leaves of russet paper . At the center rose a massive monument . A dozen male figures , each carrying an instrument or tool , danced in a dreadful ritual grace around a female form , who stood with arms raised high , upturned face twisted in some overpowering emotion . Reith could not identify her expression . Exultation ? Agony ? Grief ? Beatification ? Whatever the case , the monument was disturbing , and rasped at a dark corner of his mind like a mouse in the woodwork . The monument seemed very old ? thousands of years ? Reith could not be sure . A small girl and a somewhat younger boy came past . They paused first to study Reith ; then gave fascinated attention to the gliding figures and their macabre instruments . Reith , in a somber mood , continued on his way and presently came to the Travelers ' Inn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had , however , hired accommodations : a suite of four rooms overlooking the Oval . Reith bathed , changed his linen . When he went down to the foyer , twilight had come to the Oval , which was now lit by a ring of great luminous globes in a variety of pastel colors . Traz and Anacho appeared on the other side of the Oval . Reith watched them with a wry grin . They were basically alien , like cat and dog ; yet , when circumstances threw them together , they conducted themselves with cautious good-fellowship . Anacho and Traz , so it developed , had chanced upon an area known as " the Mall , " where cavaliers settled affairs of honor . In the course of the afternoon the two had watched three bouts :  | near-bloodless affairs , Traz reported with a sniff of scorn . " The ceremonies exhaust their energy , " said Anacho . " After the addresses and the punctilio there is little time for fighting . " " The Yao , if anything , are more peculiar than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I dispute that ! You know a single Dirdirman . I can show you a thousand and confuse you totally . But come ; the refectory is around the corner . If nothing else , the Yao cuisine is satisfactory . " The three dined in a wide room hung with tapestries . As usual Reith could not identify what he ate , and did not care to learn . There was yellow broth , faintly sweet , with floating flakes of pickled bark ; slices of pale meat layered with flower petals ; a celery-like vegetable crusted with crumbs of a fiery-hot spice ; cakes flavored with musk and resin ; black berries with a flavor of the swamp ; clear white wine which tingled the mouth . In an adjacent tavern the three took after-dinner liquors . The clientele included many non-Yao folk , who seemed to use the place as a rendezvous . One of these , a tall old man in a leather bonnet , somewhat the worse for drink , peered into Reith 's face . " But I 'm wrong , for a fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked myself , where are his tongs ? And I said , no , it is just another of the anomes who creep into Travelers ' Inn for a sight of their own kind . " " I 'd like a sight of my own kind , " said Reith . " Nothing would please me more . " " Yes , is n't this the case ? What sort are you , then ? I ca n't put a name to your face . " " A wanderer from far lands . " " No farther than mine , which is the far coast of Vord , where Cape Dread holds back the Schanizade . I have seen sights , I tell you ! Raids on Arkady ! Battles with sea-folk ! I remember an occasion when we drove into the mountains and destroyed the bandits . . . I was a young man then and a great soldier ; now I toil for the ease of the Yao , and earn my own ease thereby , and it is not so hard a life . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nothing so grand . I inspect wheels at the car yard . " " Many foreign technicians are at work in Settra ? " " True . Cath is comfortable enough , if you can overlook the vagaries of the Yao. "  | " What about Wankhmen ? Are there any such in Settra ? " " At work ? Never . When I sojourned at Ao Zalil , to the east of Lake Falas , I saw how it went . The Wankhmen will not even work for the Wankh ; they have sufficient exertion pronouncing the Wankh chimes . Though usually they play the chords on remarkable little instruments . " " Who works in the Wankh shops ? Blacks and Purples ? " " Bah ! One might be forced to handle an article the other had touched . Back-country Lokhars for the most part work in the shops . For ten or twenty years , or longer , they toil , then they return to their villages rich men . Wankhmen at work in the shops ? What a joke ! They are as proud as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , he is my comrade . " " Odd to find a Dirdirman so common ! " marveled the old man . " I have seen only three previously and all treated me like dirt . " He drained his goblet , set it down with a rap . " Now I must leave ; I bid all good evening , Dirdirman as well . " The old man departed . With almost the same swing of the door a pale black-haired young man dressed unobtrusively in dark blue broadcloth entered the tavern . Somewhere , thought Reith , he had seen this young man , and recently . . . Where ? The man walked slowly , almost absentmindedly , along the passage beside the wall . He went to the serving counter , was poured a goblet of sharp syrup . As he turned away his gaze met that of Reith 's . He nodded politely and after a moment 's hesitation approached . Reith now recognized him for Cizante 's pallid young aide . " Good evening , " said the young man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isan , a Blue Jade connection . I believe that we met today . " " I had a few words with your master , true enough . " Helsse sipped from his goblet , made a fastidious grimace , placed the goblet on the bar . " Let 's move to a more secluded place , where we can talk . " Reith spoke to Traz and Anacho , then turned back to Helsse . " Lead the way . " Helsse glanced casually toward the front entrance but chose to leave through the restaurant . As they departed Reith glimpsed a man thrusting into the tavern , to glare wildly around the room : Dordolio.  | Helsse appeared not to notice . " Nearby is a little cabaret , not overly genteel , but as good as anywhere else for our talk . " The cabaret was a low-ceilinged room , lit by red and blue lamps with blue-painted booths around the periphery . A number of musicians sat on a platform , two of whom played small gongs and drum , while a male dancer strode sinuously this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , as far as possible from the musicians ; the two seated themselves on blue cushions . Helsse ordered two drams of " Wildwood Tincture " which were presently brought to the table . The dancer departed , the musicians undertook a new selection , with instruments similar to oboe , flute , cello , and a kettledrum . Reith listened for a moment , puzzled by the plaintive scraping , the thumps of the kettledrum , the sudden excited trills of the flute . Helsse leaned solicitously forward . " You are unfamiliar with Yao music ? I thought as much . This is one of the traditional forms : a lament . " " It could never be mistaken for a cheerful composition . " " A question of degree . " Helsse went on to list a series of musical forms , of decreasing optimism . " I do not mean to imply that the Yao are a dour folk ; you need only attend one of the season balls to appreciate this . " " I doubt if I will be invited , " said Reith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passionate phrases , taken up by each instrument at varying instants , to terminate in a wild sustained quaver . By some crosssensoral stimulus , Reith thought of the monument in the circular park . " The music bears some connection with your ritual of expi-ation ? " Helsse smiled distantly . " I have heard it said that the spirit of Pathetic Communion permeates the Yao psyche . " " Interesting . " Reith waited . Helsse had not brought him here to discuss music . " I trust that the events of this afternoon caused you no incon-venience ? " asked Helsse . " None whatever , other than irritation . " " You did not expect the boon ? " " I knew nothing of it . I expected ordinary courtesy , certainly . My reception by Lord Cizante , in retrospect , seems remarkable . " Helsse nodded sagely . " He is a remarkable man . But now he  | finds himself in an awkward position . Immediately upon your departure the cavalier Dordolio presented himself to denounce you as an interloper , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such a proceeding , on Dordolio 's terms , would embarrass Lord Cizante , when one takes all into consideration . You perhaps would not be aware that Blue Jade and Gold-Carnelian are rival houses . Lord Cizante suspects that Dordolio would use the boon to humiliate Blue Jade , with what consequences no one can foresee . " Reith asked : " Exactly what was the boon promised by Ci-zante ? " " Emotion overcame his reserve , " said Helsse . " He declared : ' Whoever returns me my daughter or so much as brings me news , let him ask and I will fulfill as best I can . ' Strong language , as you see , uttered only for the ears of Blue Jade , but the news circulated . " " It appears , " said Reith , " that I do Cizante a favor by accepting his bounty . " " This is what we wish to ascertain , " said Helsse carefully . " Dordolio has made a number of scurrilous statements in regard to you . He declares you a superstitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you demanded that Lord Cizante convert his palace into a temple and himself join the ' cult , ' he might well prefer ' Dordolio 's terms . " " Even though I appeared first on the scene ? " " Dordolio claims trickery , and is violently angry . But all this to the side , what might you demand of Lord Cizante , in light of the circumstances ? " Reith considered . Unfortunately , he could not afford the prideful luxury of refusal . " I 'm not sure . I could use some unprejudiced advice , but I do n't know where to find it . " " Try me , " suggested Helsse . " You are hardly unprejudiced . " " Much more than you might think . " Reith studied the pale handsome face , the still black eyes . A puzzling man was Helsse , the more so for his impersonality , neither cordial nor cold . He spoke with ostensible candor but permitted no inadvertent or unconscious signals to advertise the state of his inner self . The orchestra had dispersed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long maroon robe . Behind him sat a woman p 215 with long black hair plucking a lute . The man produced an ululating wail : half-words which Reith was unable to comprehend . " Another traditional melody ? " he inquired . Helsse shrugged . " A special mode of singing . It is not altogether without value . If everyone belabored themselves thusly , there would be far less awaile . ' Reith listened . " Judge me harshly , all , " moaned the singer . " I have performed a terrible crime ; it is because of my despair . " " Offhand , " said Reith , " it seems absurd to discuss my best advantage over Lord Cizante with Cizante 's aide . " " Ah , but your best advantage is not necessarily Lord Ci-zante 's disadvantage , " said Helsse . " With Dordolio the case is different . " " Lord Cizante showed me no great courtesy , " mused Reith . " I am not anxious to do him a favor . On the other hand , I do not care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Lord Cizante was perhaps shocked by your news , " suggested Helsse . " As for Dordolio 's charge , it is obviously inaccurate and need no longer be considered . " Reith grinned . " Dordolio has known me a month ; can you dispute him on the basis of such short acquaintance ? " If he had hoped to discomfit Helsse , he was unsuccessful . Helsse 's smile was bland . " I am usually correct in my apprais-als . " " Suppose that I were to make a set of apparently wild assertions : that Tschai was flat , that the tenets of the ' cult ' were correct , that men could live underwater  --  what would become of your opinion ? " Helsse considered soberly . " Each case is different . If you told me Tschai was flat , I would certainly revise my judgment . If you argued the creed of the ' cult , ' I would suspend a decision and listen to your remarks , for here is a matter of opinion and no evidence exists , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could live underwater I might be inclined to accept the statement as a working premise . After all , the Pnume submerge , as do the Wankh ; why not men , perhaps with special equipment ? " " Tschai is not flat , " said Reith . " Men are able to live underwater for short periods using artificial gills . I know nothing of the ' cult ' or its doctrines . " Helsse sipped from his goblet of essence . The singer had departed ; a dance troupe now came forth : men in black leggings  | and sleeves , nude from upper thigh to rib cage . Reith stared in fascination for a moment or two , then looked away . " Traditional dances , " explained Helsse , " relating to Pathetic Communion . This is ' Precursory Movement of the Ministrants toward the Expiator . ' " " The ' ministrants ' are torturers ? " " They are those who provide latitude for absolute expiation . Many become popular heroes because of their passionate tech-niques . " Helsse rose to his feet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ' cult . ' As it happens , I know the location of their meeting place , which is not far from here . If you are interested , I will take you there . " " If the visit is not contrary to the laws of Cath . " " No fear of that . Cath has no laws , only customs , which seems to suit the Yao well enough . " " Peculiar , " said Reith . " Killing is not proscribed ? " " It offends custom , at least under certain circumstances . However , the professional assassins of the Guild and the Service Company work without public reproach . In general the folk of Cath do what they see fit and suffer more or less opprobrium . So you may visit the ' cult ' and incur , at the worse , invective . " Reith rose to his feet . " Very well ; lead the way . " They walked across the Oval , through a winding alley into a dim avenue . The eccentric silhouettes of the houses opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranged . Helsse rapped at a door displaying a pale blue phosphor . The two men waited in silence . The door opened a crack ; a long-nosed face peered forth . " Visitors , " said Helsse . " May we come in ? " " You are associates ? I must inform you that here is the district center for the Society of Yearning Refluxives . " " We are not associates . This gentleman is an outlander who wishes to learn something of the ' cult . ' " " He is welcome and yourself as well , since you seem to have no concern for ' place . ' " " None whatever . " " Which marks you either the highest of the high or the lowest of the low . Enter then . We have little entertainment to offer  --  convictions , a few theories , fewer facts . " The Refluxive swept aside a curtain . " Enter . " Helsse and Reith stepped into a large low room . To one side , p 217 forlorn in so much vacant space , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Refluxive made a half-obsequious , half-sardonic gesture . " Here we are ; stare yourself full at the dreadful ' cult . ' Have you ever seen anything less obstreperous ? " " The ' cult , ' " said Helsse , somewhat sententiously , " is despised not for the look of its meeting halls , but for its provocative assumptions . " " ' Assumptions ' bah ! " declared the Refluxive in a voice of peevish complaint . " The others persecute us but we are the chosen in knowledge . " Reith asked : " What , precisely , do you know ? " " We know that men are strangers to Tschai . " " How can you know this ? " demanded Helsse . " Human history fades into murk . " " It is an intuitive Truth . We are equally certain that someday the Human Magi will call their seed back Home ! And then what joy ! Home is a world of bounty , with air that rejoices in the lungs , like the sweetest Iphthal wine ! On Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Death is a strange accident , not a fate ; all men wander with joy and peace for company , with delicious viands everywhere for the eating ! " " A delightful vision , " said Helsse , " but do you not consider it somewhat conjectural ? Or more properly , institutional dogma ? " " Possibly so , " declared the stubborn Refluxive . " Still , dogma is not necessarily falsehood . These are revealed truths , and behold : the revealed image of Home ! " He pointed to a world globe three feet in diameter hanging at eye-level . Reith went to inspect the globe , tilting his head this way and that , trying to identify outline of sea and shore , finding here a haunting familiarity , there utter disparity . Helsse came to stand beside him . " What does it look like to you ? " His voice was light and careless . " Nothing in particular . " Helsse gave a soft grunt of mingled relief and perhaps disappointment , or so it seemed to Reith . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . " Why not join the Society ? " she wheedled . " We need new faces , new blood , to augment the vast new tide . Wo n't you help us make contact with Home ? " Reith laughed . " Is there a practical method ? "  | " To be sure ! Telepathy ! Indeed , we have no other recourse . " " Why not a spaceship ? " The woman seemed bewildered , and looked sharply to see if Reith was serious . " Where could we lay our hands on a space-ship ? " " They are nowhere to be bought ? Even a small one ? " " I have never heard of such a case . " " Nor I , " was Helsse 's dry comment . " Where would we fare ? " demanded the woman , halftruculently . " Home is situated in the constellation Clari , but space is vast ; we would drift forever . " " The problems are large , " Reith agreed . " Still , assuming that your premise is correct ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " demanded the fat woman in a shocked voice . ' Revelation , ' rather . " " Possibly so . But mysticism is not a practical approach to space travel . Let us suppose that by one means or another , you find yourself in command of a spaceship , then you might very easily verify the basis of your belief . Simply fly into the constellation Clari , halting at appropriate intervals to monitor the area for radio signals . Sooner or later , if the world Home exists , a suitable instrument will detect the signals . " " Interesting , " said Helsse . " You assume that such a world , if it exists , is sufficiently advanced to propagate these signals ? " Reith shrugged . " Since we 're assuming the world , why not assume the signals ? " Helsse had nothing to say . The Refluxive declared , " Ingenious but superficial ! How , for instance , would we obtain a spaceship ? " " With sufficient funds and technical competence you could build a small vessel . " " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no such funds . " " The least of the difficulties , or so I would think , " murmured Helsse . " The second possibility is to buy a small boat from one of the spacefaring peoples : the Dirdir , the Wankh , or perhaps even the Blue Chasch . " " Again a question of sequins , " said the Refluxive . " How much would a spaceboat cost ? " p 219 Reith looked at Helsse , who pursed his lips . " Half a million sequins , should anyone be willing to sell , which I doubt . " " The third possibility is the most direct , " said Reith . " Confiscation , pure and simple . " " Confiscation ? From whom ? Though members of the ' cult ' we are not yet lunatics . " The fat woman gave a sniff of disapproval . " The man is a wild romantic . " The Refluxive said gently , " We would gladly accept you as an associate , but you must discover orthodox methodology . Classes in thought-control and projective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Azday . If you care to attend ? " " I 'm afraid that this is impossible , " said Reith . " But your program is interesting and I hope it brings fruitful returns . " Helsse made a courteous sign ; the two departed . They walked along the quiet avenue in silence . Then Helsse inquired : " What is your opinion now ? " " The situation speaks for itself , " said Reith . " You are convinced then that their doctrine is implausible ? " " I would not go quite so far . Scientists have undoubtedly found biological links between Pnume , Phung , night-hounds , and other indigenous creatures . Blue Chasch , Green Chasch , and Old Chasch are similarly related , as are all the races of man . But Pnume , Wankh , Chasch , Dirdir , and Man are biologically distinct . What does this suggest to you ? " " I agree that the circumstances are puzzling . Have you any explanation ? " " I feel that more facts are needed . Perhaps the Refluxives will become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked along in silence . They turned a corner . Reith pulled Helsse to a halt . " Quiet ! " He waited . The shuffle of footsteps sounded ; a dark shape rounded the corner . Reith seized the figure , spun it around , applied an arm and neck lock . Helsse made one or two tentative motions ; Reith , trusting no one , kept him in his field of vision . " Make a light , " said Reith . " Let 's see whom we have . Or what . " Helsse brought forth a glow-bulb , held it up . The captive squirmed , kicked , lurched ; Reith tightened his grip and felt the snap of a bone , but the figure , sagging , toppled Reith off balance . From the unseen face came a hiss of triumph ; it snatched itself free . Then , to a flicker of metal , it gave a gasp of pain .  | Helsse held up his glow-bulb , disengaged his dagger from the back of the twitching shape , while Reith stood by , mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blade . " Helsse shrugged . " His kind carry stings . " He turned the body over with his foot ; a small tinkle sounded as a glass sliver fell against the stone . The two peered curiously into the white face , half-shrouded under the brim of an extravagantly wide black hat . " He hats himself like a Pnumekin , " said Helsse , " and he is pale as a ghost . " " Or a Wankhman , " said Reith . " But I think he is something different from either ; what , I could not say . Perhaps a hybrid , a mingling , which , so it is said , makes the best personnel for spy work . " Reith dislodged the hat , to reveal a stark bald pate . The face was fine-boned , somewhat loosely-muscled ; the nose was thin and limber and terminated in a lump . The eyes , half-open , seemed to be black . Bending close , Reith thought that the scalp had been shaven . Helsse looked uneasily up and down the street . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds us and issues an infor-mation . " " Not so fast , " said Reith . " No one is near . Hold the light ; stand yonder , where you can see along the street . " Helsse reluctantly obeyed and Reith was able to watch him sidelong as he searched the corpse . The garments had a queer musky odor ; Reith 's stomach jerked as he felt here and there . From an inner pocket of the cloak he took a clip of paper . At the belt hung a soft leather pouch , which he detached . " Come ! " hissed Helsse . " We must not be discovered , we would lose all ' place . ' " They proceeded back to the Oval and across to the Travelers ' Inn . In the arcade before the entrance they paused . " The evening was interesting , " said Reith . " I learned a great deal . " " I wish I could say the same , " said Helsse . " What did you take from the dead man ? " Reith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He brought forth the clip of paper , and the two examined it in the light streaming out of the inn , to find rows of a peculiar writing : a series of rectangles , variously shaded and marked . Helsse looked at Reith . " Do you recognize this script ? " p 221 " No . " Helsse gave a short sharp bark of laughter . " It is Wankh . " " Hm . What would be the significance of this ? " " Simply more mystery . Settra is a hive of intrigue . Spies are everywhere . " " And spy devices ? Microphones ? Eye-cells ? " " It is safe to assume as much . " " Then it would be safe to assume that the Refluxive 's hall is monitored . . . Perhaps I was too free with advice . " " If the dead man were the monitor , your words are now lost . But allow me to take custody of the notes . I will have them translated ; there is a colony of Lokhars nearby and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will go together , " said Reith . " Will tomorrow suit you ? " " Well enough , " said Helsse glumly . He looked off across the Oval . " Finally then : what must I tell Lord Cizante as to the boon ? " " I do n't know , " said Reith . " I 'll have an answer tomorrow . " " The situation may be clarified even sooner , " said Helsse . " Here is Dordolio . " Reith swung around , to find Dordolio striding toward him , followed by two suave cavaliers . Dordolio was clearly in a fury . 1Ie halted a yard in front of Reith and , thrusting forth his head , blurted : " With your vicious tricks , you have ruined me ! Have you no shame ? " He took off his hat , hurled it into Reith 's face . Reith stepped aside , the hat went wheeling off into the Oval . Dordolio shook his finger in Reith 's face ; Reith backed away a step . " Your death is assured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my sword ! Low-caste assassins will drown you in cattle excrement ! Twenty pariahs will drub your corpse ! A cur will drag your head along the street by the tongue ! " Reith managed a painful grin . " Cizante will arrange the same for you , at my request . It 's as good a boon as any . " " Cizante , bah ! A wicked parvenu , a moping invert . Blue Jade shall be nothing ; the fall of that palace will culminate the ' round ' ! " Helsse came slightly forward . " Before you enlarge upon your remarkable assertions , be advised that I represent the House of Blue Jade , and that I will be impelled to report to his Excellency Lord Cizante the substance of your comments . " " Do not bore me with triviality ! " stormed Dordolio . He furi-  | ously motioned to Reith . " Fetch my hat , or tomorrow expect the first of the Twelve Touches ! " " A small concession , " said Reith , " if it ensures your depar-ture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it once or twice , handed it to him . " Your hat , which you threw across the square . " He stepped around Dordolio , entered the foyer of the inn . Dordolio gave a somewhat subdued caw of laughter , slapped his hat against his thigh , and , signaling his comrades , walked away . In the foyer of the inn Reith asked Helsse , " What are the ' Twelve Touches ' ? " " At intervals  --  perhaps a day , perhaps two days  --  an assassin will tap the victim with a twig . The twelfth touch is fatal ; the man dies . By accumulated poison , by a single final dose , or by morbid suggestion , only the Assassins ' Guild knows . And now I must return to Blue Jade . Lord Cizante will be interested in my report . " " What do you intend to tell him ? " Helsse only laughed . " You , the most secretive of men , asking me that ! Still , Cizante will hear that you have agreed to accept a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I said nothing of this ! " " It will still be an element of my report . " 8 REITH AWOKE TO wan sunlight shining through the heavy amber panes of the windows . He lay on the unfamiliar couch , collecting the threads of his existence . It was difficult not to feel a profound gloom . Cath , where he had hoped to find flexibility , enlightenment , and perhaps cooperation , was hardly less harsh an environment than the Aman Steppe . It was obvious folly to dream of building a spaceboat in Settra . Reith sat up on the couch . He had known horror , grief , disillusionment , but there had been corresponding moments of triumph and hope , even a few spasmodic instants of joy . If he were to die tomorrow  --  or in twelve days after twelve " touches " ? he had already lived a miraculous life . Very well then , he would put his destiny to the test . Helsse had predicted his departure from Cath ; Helsse had read the future , or Reith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Breakfasting with Traz and Anacho he described his adventures of the previous evening . Anacho found the circumstances perturbing . " This is an insane society , constrained by punctilio as a rotten egg is held by its shell . Whatever your aims  --  and sometimes I think that you are the most flamboyant lunatic of all ? they will not be achieved here . " " I agree . " " Well then , " said Traz , " what next ? " " What I plan is dangerous , perhaps rash folly . But I see no other alternative . I intend to ask Cizante for money ; this we shall share . Then I think it best that we separate . You , Traz , might do worse than to return to Wyness , and there make a life for yourself . Perhaps Anacho will do the same . Neither of you can profit by coming with me ; in fact , I guarantee the reverse . " Anacho looked off across the square . " Until now you have managed to survive , if precariously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve . With your permission , I will join your expedition , which I suspect is by no means as desperate as you make it out to be . " " I intend to confiscate a Wankh spaceship from the Ao Hidis spaceport , or elsewhere , if it seems more convenient . " Anacho threw his hands in the air . " I feared no less . " He proceeded to state a hundred objections which Reith did not trouble to contradict . " All very true ; I will end my days in a Wankh dungeon or a night-hound 's belly ; still this is what I intend to attempt . I strongly urge that you and Traz make your way to the Isles of Cloud and live as best you may . " " Bah , " snorted Anacho . " Why wo n't you attempt some reasonable exploit , like exterminating the Pnume , or teaching the Chasch to sing ? " " I have other ambitions . " " Yes , yes , your faraway planet , the home of man . I am tempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " As for me , " said Traz , " I would like to see this far world . I know it exists , because I saw the spaceboat in which Adam Reith arrived . " Anacho inspected the youth with eyebrows raised . " You have not mentioned this previously . " " You never asked . " " How might such an absurdity enter my mind ? "  | " A person who calls facts absurdities will often be surprised , " said Traz . " But at least he has organized the cosmic relationship into categories , which sets him apart from animals and sub-men . " Reith intervened . " Come now ; let 's put our energies to work , since you both seem bent on suicide . Today we seek information . And here is Helsse , bringing us important news , or so it appears from his aspect . " Helsse approached and gave a polite greeting . " Last night , as you may imagine , I had much to report to Lord Cizante . He urges that you make some reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He recommends that we destroy the papers taken from the spy and I am inclined to agree . If you acquiesce , Lord Cizante may grant further concessions . " " Of what nature ? " " He does not specify , but I suspect he has in mind a certain slackening of protocol in regard to your presence in Blue Jade Palace . " " I am more interested in the documents than in Lord Cizante . If he wants to see me he can come here to the inn . " Helsse gave a brittle chuckle . " Your response is no surprise . If you are ready I will conduct you to South Ebron where we will find a Lokhar . " " There are no Yao scholars who read the Wankh language ? " " Such facility would seem pointless expertise . " " Until someone wanted a document translated . " Helsse gave an indifferent twitch . " At this play of the ' round , ' Utilitarianism is an alien philosophy . Lord Cizante , for instance , would find your arguments not only incomprehensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , " said Reith equably . Helsse had come in an extremely elegant equipage : a blue carriage with six scarlet wheels and a profusion of golden festoons . The interior was like a luxurious drawing room , with gray-green wainscoting , a pale gray carpet , an arched ceiling covered with green silk . The chairs were deeply upholstered ; to the side , under the windows of pale green glass , a buffet offered trays of sweetmeats . Helsse ushered his guests into the car with the utmost politeness ; today he wore a suit of pale green and gray , as if to blend himself into the decor of the carriage . When all were seated , he touched a button to close the door  | and retract the steps . Reith observed , " Lord Cizante , while deriding utilitarianism as a doctrine , apparently does not flout its ap-plications . " " You refer to the door-closing mechanism ? He is not aware that it exists . Someone is always at hand to touch the button for him . Like others of his class he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this odd ? No matter . You must accept the Yao gentry as you find them . " " Evidently you do not regard yourself as a member of the Yao gentry . " Helsse laughed . " More tactful might be the conjecture that I enjoy what I am doing . " He spoke into a mesh . " To the South Ebron Mercade . " The carriage eased into motion . Helsse poured goblets of syrup and proffered sweetmeats . " You are about to visit our commercial district ; the source of our wealth , in fact , though it is considered vulgar to discuss it . " " Strange , " mused Anacho . " Dirdir , at the highest level , are never so hoity-toity . " " They are a different race , " said Helsse . " Superior ? I am not convinced . The Wankh would never agree , should they trouble to examine the concept . " Anacho gave a contemptuous shrug but said no more . The carriage rolled through a market area : the Mercade , then into a district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At a cluster of squat brick towers the carriage halted . Helsse pointed to a nearby garden where sat a dozen men of spectacular appearance . They wore white shirts and trousers , their hair , long and abundant , was also white ; in striking contrast to the lusterless black of their skins . " Lokhars , " said Helsse . " Migrating mechanics from the highlands north of Lake Falas in Central Kislovan . That is not their natural coloration ; they bleach their hair and dye their skin . Some say the Wankh enforced the custom upon them thousands of years ago to differentiate them from Wankhmen , who of course are white-skinned and black-haired . In any event , they come and go , working where they gain the highest return , for they are a remarkably avaricious folk . Some , after laboring in the Wankh shops , have migrated north to Cath ; a few of these know a chime or two of Wankh-talk and occasionally can puzzle out the sense of Wankh documents . Notice the old man yonder playing with the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any . He will demand a large sum for his efforts , and in order to forestall even more exorbitant demands in the future I must haggle with him . If you will be good enough to wait , I will go to make the arrangements . " " A moment , " said Reith . " At a conscious level I am convinced of your integrity , but I ca n't control my instinctive suspicions . Let us make the arrangement together . " " As you wish , " said Helsse graciously . " I will send the chauffeur for the man . " He spoke into the mesh . Anacho murmured , " If the arrangements were already made , the qualms of a trusting person might easily be drugged . " Helsse nodded judiciously . " I believe I can assuage your anx-ieties . " A moment later the old man sauntered up to the carriage . " Inside , if you please , " said Helsse . The old man poked his white-maned face through the door . " My time is valuable ; what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your profit . " " Profit , eh ? I can at least listen . " He entered the carriage , and seated himself with a comfortable grunt . The air took on the odor of a spicy , slightly rancid pomade . Helsse stood in front of him . With a side glance toward Reith he said , " Our arrangement is canceled . Do not heed my instructions . " " ' Arrangement ' ? ' Instructions ' ? What are you talking about ? You must mistake me for another . I am Zarfo Detwiler . " Helsse made an easy gesture . " It 's all one . We want you to translate a Wankh document for us , the guide to a treasure hoard . Translate correctly , you shall share the booty . " " No , no , none of that . " Zarfo Detwiler waved a black finger . " I 'll share the booty with pleasure ; additionally I want a hundred sequins , and no recriminations if I fail to satisfy you . " " No recriminations , agreed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : five sequins and eat your fill of the expensive sweetmeats . " " That last I 'll do anyway ; am I not your invited guest ? " Zarfo Detwiler popped a handful of dainties into his mouth . " You must think me a moon-calf to offer but five sequins . Only three persons in Settra can so much as tell you which side of a Wankh ideogram is up . I alone can read meaning , by virtue of thirty toilsome years in the Ao Hidis machine shops . " The haggling proceeded ; Zarfo Detwiler eventually agreed to  | fifty sequins and a tenth share of the assumptive spoils . Helsse signaled Reith , who produced the documents . Zarfo Detwiler took the papers , squinted , frowned , ran his fingers through his white mane . He looked up and spoke somewhat ponderously : " I will instruct you in Wankh communication at no charge . The Wankh are a peculiar folk , totally unique . Their brain works in pulses . They see in pulses and think in pulses . eir speech comes in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of a sentence . Each ideogram is equivalent a chime , which is to say , a whole unit of meaning . For this reason , to read Wankh is as much a matter of divination as logic ; one must enunciate an entire meaning with each ideogram . Even the Wankhmen are not always accurate . Now this matter you have here  --  let me see . This first chime  --  hm . Notice this comb ? It usually signifies an equivalence , an identity . A square of this texture shading off to the right sometimes means ' truth ' or ' verified perCeption ' or ' situation ' or perhaps ' present condition of the cos- . ' These marks  --  I do n't know . This bit of shading  --  I think a a person talking . Since it 's at the bottom , the base tone in the ord , it would seem that  --  yes , this trifle here indicates positive volition . These marks  --  hm . Yes , these are organizers , which specify the order and emphasis of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only guess at the total sense . Something like ' I wish to report that conditions are identical or unchanged ' or ' A on is anxious to specify that the cosmos is stable . ' Something the sort . Are you sure that this is information regarding treasure ? " " It was sold to us on this basis . " " Hm . " Zarfo pulled at his long black nose . " Let me see . This and symbol : notice this shading and this bit of an angle ? One ' vision ' ; the other is ' negation . ' I ca n't read the organizers , but might mean ' blindness ' or ' invisibility ... ' " Zarfo continued his lucubrations , poring over each ideogram , occasionally tracing out a fragment of meaning , more often confessing failure , and becoming ever more restive . " You have been ! gulled , " he said at last . " I 'm certain there is no mention of money or treasure . I believe this is no more than a commercial report . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' I wish to state that conditions are the same . ' Something about peculiar wishes , or hopes , tl r volition . ' I will presently see the dominant man , the leader of our group . ' Something unknown . ' The leader is not helpful , ' or  | perhaps ' stays aloof . " The leader slowly changes , or metamorphoses , to the enemy . ' Or perhaps , ' The leader slowly changes to become like the enemy . ' Change of some sort  --  I ca n't understand . ' I request more money . ' Something about arrival of a newcomer or stranger ' of utmost importance . ' That 's about all . " Reith thought to sense an almost imperceptible relaxation in Helsse 's manner . " No great illumination , " said Helsse briskly . " Well , you have done your best . Here is your twenty sequins . " " ' Twenty sequins ' ! " roared Zarfo Detwiler . " The price agreed was fifty ! How can I buy my bit of meadowland if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you choose to be niggardly . " " Niggardly , indeed ! Next time read the message yourself . " " I could do as well , for all the help you 've given us . " " You were duped . That is no guide to treasure . " " Apparently not . Well then , good day to you . " Reith followed Zarfo from the carriage . He looked back in at Helsse . " I 'll remain here , for a word or two with this gentleman . " Helsse was not pleased . " We must discuss another matter . It is necessary that the Blue Jade Lord receives information . " " This afternoon I will have a definite answer for you . " Helsse gave a curt nod . " As you wish . " The carriage departed , leaving Reith and the Lokhar standing in the street . Reith said , " Is there a tavern nearby ? Perhaps we can chat over a bottle . " " I am a Lokhar , " snorted the black-skinned old man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with drink ; not before noon , at any rate . However you may buy me a fine Zam sausage , or a clut of head-cheese . " " With pleasure . " Zarfo led the way to a food shop ; the two men took their purchases to a table on the street . " I am amazed by your ability to read the ideograms , " said Reith . " Where did you learn ? " " At Ao Hidis . I worked as a die cutter beside an old Lokhar who was a true genius . He taught me to recognize a few chimes , and showed me where the shadings matched intensity vibrations , where sonority equated with shape , where the various chord components matched texture and gradation . Both the chimes and the ideograms are regular and rational , once the eye p 229 and the ear are tuned . But the tuning is difficult . " Zarfo took a great bite of sausage . " Needless to say , the Wankhmen discourage such learning ; if they suspect a Lokhar of diligent study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot ! They jealously guard their role as intercessors between the Wankh and the world of men . A devious folk ! The women are strangely beautiful , like black pearls , but cruel and cold , and not prone to dalliance . " " The Wankh pay well ? " " Like everyone else , as little as possible . But we are forced to concede . If labor costs rose , they would take slaves , or train Blacks and Purples , one or the other . We would then lose employment and perhaps our freedom as well . So we strive without too much complaint , and seek more profitable employment elsewhere once we are skilled . " " It is highly likely , " said Reith , " that the Yao Helsse , in the gray and green suit , will ask what we discussed . He may even offer you money . " Zarfo bit off a chunk of sausage . " I shall naturally tell all , if I am paid enough . " " In that case , " said Reith , " our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " Zarfo chewed thoughtfully . " How much profit had you in mind ? " " I do n't care to specify , since you would only ask Helsse for more , or try to extract the same from both of us . " Zarfo sighed dismally . " You have a sorry opinion of the Lokhar . Our word is our bond ; once we strike a bargain we do not deviate . " The haggling continued on a more or less cordial level until for the sum of twenty sequins Zarfo agreed to guard the privacy of the conversation as fiercely as he might the hiding place of his money , and the sum was paid over . " Back to the Wankh message for a moment , " said Reith . " There were references to a ' leader . ' Were there hints or clues by which to identify him ? " Zarfo pursed his lips . " A wolf-tone indicating high-level gentry ; another honorific brevet which might signify something like ' a person of the excellent sort ' or ' in your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult . A Wankh reading the ideogram would understand a chime , which then would stimulate a visual image complete in essential details . The Wankh would be furnished a  | mental image of the person , but for someone like myself there are , only crude outlines . I can tell no more . " " You work in Settra ? " " Alas . A man of my years and impoverished : is n't it a pity ? But I near my goal , and then  --  back to Smargash , in Lokhara , for a bit of meadow , a young wife , a comfortable chair by the hearth . " " You worked in the space shops at Ao Hidis ? " " Yes , indeed ; I transferred from the tool works to the space shops , where I repaired and installed air purifiers . " " Lokhar mechanics must be very skillful , then . " " Oh , indeed . " " Certain mechanics specialize upon the installation of , say , controls and instruments ? " " Naturally . Complex trades , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Zarfo gave Reith a calculating glance . " How much is the information worth to you ? " " Control your avarice , " said Reith . " No more money today . Another sausage , if you like . " " Later , perhaps . Now as to the mechanics : in Smargash are dozens , hundreds , retired after lifetimes of toil . " " Could they be tempted to join in a dangerous venture ? " " No doubt , if the danger were scant and the profit high . What do you propose ? " Reith threw caution to the winds . " Assume that someone wished to confiscate a Wankh spaceship and fly it to an unspecified destination : how many specialists would be required , and how much would it cost to hire them ? " Zarfo , to Reith 's relief , did not stare in bewilderment or shock . He gnawed for a moment at the last of the sausage . Then , after a belch , he said , " I believe that you are asking if I consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jocular manner , and for a fact the ships are not stringently guarded . The project is feasible . But why should you want a spaceship ? I do not care to visit the Dirdir on Sibol or test the infinity of the universe . " " I ca n't discuss the destination . " " Well then , how much money do you offer ? " " My plans have not progressed to that stage . What do you consider a suitable fee ? " p 231 " To risk life and freedom ? I would not stir for less than fifty ousand sequins . " Reith rose to his feet . " You have your fifty sequins ; I have my formation . I trust you to keep my secret . " Zarfo sat sprawled back in his chair . " Now then , not so fast . After all I am old and my life is not worth so much after all . Thirty thousand ? Twenty ? Ten ? " " The figure starts to become practical . How much of a crew will we need ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You envision a long voy-e ? " " As soon as we are in space , I will reveal our destination . Ten ousand sequins is only a preliminary payment . Those who go with me will return with wealth beyond their dreams . " Zarfo rose to his feet . " When do you propose to leave ? " " As soon as possible . Another matter : Settra is overrun with ies ; it 's important that we attract no attention . " Zarfo gave a hoarse laugh . " So this morning you approach me a vast carriage , worth thousands of sequins . A man watches us en now . " " I 've been noticing him . But he seems too obvious to be a spy . ell , then , where shall we meet , and when ? " " Upon the stroke of midmorning tomorrow , at the stall of pas the spice merchant in the Cercade . Be certain you are not llowed . . . That fellow yonder I believe to be an assassin , from e style of his garments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are Adam Reith ? " " Yes . " " I regret to say that the Security Assassination Company has Accepted a contract made out in your name : the Death of the hJ welve Touches . I will now administer the first inoculation . Will you be so good as to bare your arm ? I will merely prick you with this splint . " Reith backed away . " I 'll do nothing of the sort . " " Depart ! " Zarfo Detwiler told the assassin . " This man is worth ten thousand sequins to me alive ; dead , nothing . " The assassin ignored Zarfo . To Reith he said , " Please do not make an undignified display . The process then becomes protracted and painful for us all . So then ? " Zarfo roared : " Stand away ; have I not warned you ? " He  | snatched up a chair and struck the assassin to the ground . Zarfo was not yet satisfied . He picked up the splint , jabbed it into the back of the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Halt ! " wailed the assassin . " That is Inoculation Number One ! " Zarfo seized a handful of splints from the splayed-open wallet . " And here , " he roared , " are numbers Two to Twelve ! " And with a foot on the man 's neck he thrust the handful into the twitching buttocks . " There you are , you knave ! Do you want the next episode , Numbers Thirteen to Twenty-four ? " " No , no , let me be ; I am a dead man now ! " " If not , you 're a cheat as well as an assassin ! " Passersby had halted to watch . A portly woman in pink silk rushed forward . " You hairy black villain , what are you doing to that poor assassin ? He is only a workman at his trade ! " Zarfo picked up the assassin 's work sheet , looked down the list . " Hm . It appears that your husband is next on his list . " The woman looked with startled eyes after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time we were leaving , " said Reith . They walked through back alleys to a small shed , screened from the street by a lattice of woven withe . " It is the neighborhood corpse-house , " said Zarfo . " No one will bother us here . " Reith entered , looked gingerly around the black benches on one of which lay the hulk of a small animal . " Now then , " said Zarfo , " who is your enemy ? " " I suspect a certain Dordolio , " said Reith . " I ca n't be sure . " Zarfo scrutinized the work sheet . " Well , we shall see . ' Adam Reith , the Travelers ' Inn  --  Contract Number Two-three-o-five , Style Eighteen ; prepaid . ' Dated today , surcharged ' Rush . ' Prepaid , eh ? Well then , let us try a ruse . Back to my cottage . " He took Reith to one of the brick towers , entered by an arched doorway . On a table rested a telephone . Zarfo lifted the instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assassination Company . " A grave voice spoke . " We are here to serve your needs . " " I refer to Contract Number Two-three-o-five , " said Zarfo , " relating to a certain Adam Reith . I ca n't find the estimate and I wish to pay the charges . " " A moment , my lord . "  | The voice presently returned . " The contract was prepaid , my lord ; and was scheduled for execution this morning . " " Prepaid ? Impossible . I did not prepay . What is the name on the receipt ? " " The name is Helsse Izam . I 'm sure there is no mistake , sir . " " Perhaps not . I 'll discuss the matter with the person in-volved . " " Thank you , sir , for your custom . " 9 REITH RETURNED TO the Travelers ' Inn , and with a certain trepidation , entered the foyer where he found Traz . " What has occurred , if anything ? " Traz , the most lucid and decisive of individuals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Yao  --  Helsse , is that his name ? ? became silent after you left the carriage . Perhaps he found us strange company . He told us that tonight we would dine with the Blue Jade Lord , that he would come early to instruct us in decorum . Then he drove off in the carriage . " A perplexing sequence of events , reflected Reith . An interesting point : the contract had specified Twelve Touches . If his death were urgently required , a knife , a bullet , an energy bolt would serve the purpose . But the first of twelve injections ? A device to stimulate haste ? " Many things are happening , " he told Traz . " Events I do n't pretend to understand . " " The sooner we leave Settra the better , " gloomed Traz . " Agreed . " Anacho the Dirdirman appeared , freshly barbered and splendid in a new high-collared black jacket , pale blue trousers , scarlet ankle-high slippers with modish upturned toes . Reith took the two to a secluded alcove and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need only money , which I hope to extract from Cizante tonight . " The hours of the afternoon passed slowly . At last Helsse appeared , wearing a modish suit of canary yellow velvet . He gave polite greetings to the group . " You are enjoying your visit to Cath ? "  | " Indeed yes , " said Reith . " I have never felt so relaxed . " . Helsse maintained his aplomb . " Excellent . Now , in regard to this evening , Lord Cizante suspects that you and your friends might find a formal dinner somewhat tedious . He recommends rather a casual and unstructured tiffin , at a time to suit your con venience : now , if you so desire . " " We are ready , " said Reith . " But , to anticipate any misunderstanding , please remember that we insist upon a dignified reception . We do not intend to slink into the palace by a back entrance . " Helsse made an easy gesture . " For a casual occasion , casual protocol . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Reith . " Our ' place ' demands that we use the front entrance . If Lord Cizante objects , then he must meet us elsewhere : perhaps at the tavern around the Oval . " Helsse uttered an incredulous laugh . " He would as soon don a buffoon 's cap and cut capers in Merrymaker 's Round ! " He shook his head dolefully . " To avoid difficulties we will use the front entrance ; after all what difference does it make ? " Reith laughed . " Especially since Cizante has ordered us brought in by the scullery and will assume that this is how we entered . . . Well , it 's a fair compromise . Let 's go . " The trip to Blue Jade Palace was made in a sleek black landau . At Helsse 's instructions it drove up to the formal portal . Helsse alighted , and with a thoughtful glance along the facade of the palace , conducted the three outlanders through the main porta I and into the great foyer . He muttered a few words to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shallow stairs , into a small green and gold salon overlooking the courtyard . Lord Cizante was nowhere to be seen . " Please be seated , " said Helsse affably . " Lord Cizante will be with you shortly . " He gave a jerk of the head and departed the chamber . Several minutes passed , then Lord Cizante appeared . He wore a long white gown , white slippers , a black skullcap . His face was petulant and brooding ; he looked from face to face . " Which is the man to whom I spoke before ? " Helsse muttered in his ear ; he turned to face Reith . " I see . Well then , make yourself easy . Helsse , you have ordered a suitable refreshment ? " p 235 " Indeed , your Excellency . " A footman rolled in a buffet and offered trays of sweet wafers , It-barks , cubes of spiced meat , decanters of wine , flagons of esnce . Reith accepted wine ; Traz a goblet of syrup . Anacho took n essences ; Lord Cizante @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jerking it through the air . " I have negative news for you , " he said abruptly . " I have decided to withraw all proffers and undertakings . In short , you may expect no n . Reith sipped the wine and gave himself time to think . " You are honoring Dordolio 's claim ? " " I can not elaborate upon the matter . The statement may be terpreted in its most general sense . " " I have no claim upon you , " said Reith . " I came here yesterday only to convey the news of your daughter . " Lord Cizante held the incense stick under his nostrils . " The circumstances no longer interest me . " Anacho emitted a somewhat startling caw of laughter . " Unerstandable ! To acknowledge them would force you to honor our pledge ! " " Not at all , " said Lord Cizante . " I spoke only for the attention f Blue Jade personnel . " " Ha ha ! Who will believe that , now that you have hired assas-s against my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poised . " Assassins ? What of this ? " " Your aide " ? Reith indicated Helsse ? " took out a Type Eighteen contract against me . I intend to warn Dordolio ; your penury carries a vicious sting . " Lord Cizante turned a frowning glance upon Helsse . " What of this ? " Helsse stood with black eyebrows fretfully raised . " I endeavored only to fulfill my function . " " Misplaced zeal ! Would you make Blue Jade a laughing stock ? If this sordid tale gains circulation . . . " His voice suddenly trailed off . Helsse gave a shrug , and poured himself a goblet of wine . Reith rose to his feet . " Our business appears to be at an end . " " A moment , " said Lord Cizante curtly . " Let me consider .. . You realize that this so-called assassination is a mare's-nest ? "  | Reith slowly shook his head . " You have blown hot and cold too often ; I am totally skeptical . " Lord Cizante swung on his heel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it began to smolder . Reith picked it up , placed it on the tray . " Why do you do that ? " asked Helsse in sardonic won-der . " You must supply your own answer . " Lord Cizante strode back into the room . He gestured to Helsse , took him into the corner , muttered a moment , and once again departed . Helsse turned to Reith . " Lord Cizante has empowered me to pay over to you a sum of ten thousand sequins on condition that you depart Cath instantly , returning to Kotan by the first cog out of Vervodei . " " Lord Cizante 's impertinence is amazing , " said Reith . Anacho asked casually , " How high will he go ? " " He specified no precise sum , " Helsse admitted . " He is interested only in your departure , which he will facilitate in every de-tail . " " A million sequins , then , " said Anacho . " If we must acquiesce to this undignified scheme , we might as well sell ourselves dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Twenty thousand sequins is more reasonable . " " Not reasonable enough , " said Reith . " We need more , much more . " Helsse surveyed the three in silence . He said at last : " To avoid wasting time I will announce the maximum sum Lord Cizante cares to pay . It is fifty thousand sequins , which I personally consider generous , and transportation to Vervodei . " " We accept , " said Reith . " Needless to say , you must cancel the contract with the Security Company . " Helsse smiled a small tremulous smile . " I have already received my instructions in this regard . And when will you depart Settra ? " " In a day or so . " With fifty strips of purple-celled sequins , the three left Blue jade Palace , and climbed into the waiting black landau . Helsse did not accompany them . The landau wheeled east through the cinnamon dusk , under  | luminants which as yet cast no illumination . Off in the parks , palaces and town houses showed clusters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in progress . The landau rumbled across a carved wooden bridge hung with lanterns , to enter a district of crowded timber buildings , with tearooms and cafes jutting over the street . They passed through an area of bleak half-deserted tenements , and at last came into the Oval . Reith descended from the landau . Traz sprang past and threw himself on a dark silent figure . At the glint of metal Reith ducked to the ground , but failed to escape a violent purple-white flash . A hot blow pounded his head ; he lay half-stunned , while Traz struggled with the assailant . Anacho stepped forward , pointed his sting . Out sprang the thin shaft , piercing the man 's shoulder . The gun clattered to the cobbles . Reith picked himself up , stood weaving . The side of his head smarted as if by a scald ; the smell of ozone and burnt hair filled his nostrils . He tottered over to where Traz held the hooded figure in an armlock while Anacho removed his wallet and dagger . The man wore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishment , the face of the Yearning Refluxive to whom he had spoken the night before . People here and there about the Oval , at first cautious of the struggle , now started to approach . There came the shrill hoot of the patrol whistle . The Refluxive struggled to free himself . " Release me ; they 'll make me a terrible example ! " " Why did you try to kill me ? " demanded Reith . " Need you ask ? Let me go , I beg you ! " " Why should I ? You just tried to murder me ! Let them take you . " " No ! The association will suffer ! " " Well then  --  why did you try to kill me ? " " Because you are dangerous ! You would divide us ! Already there is dissension ! A few weak souls have no faith ; they want to find a spaceship and go off on a journey ! Folly ! The only way is the orthodox way ! You are a danger ; I thought it best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exasperation . The patrol was almost upon them . He said : " Tomorrow we leave Settra ; you 've had your trouble for nothing . " He gave the man a shove which  | sent him staggering and crying for the pain in his shoulder . " Be thankful we are merciful men ! " The Refluxive disappeared in the darkness . The patrol ran up : tall men in striped suits of red and black holding staffs terminating in incandescent tips . " What is the trouble ? " " A thief , " said Reith . " He tried to rob us , then ran off behind the buildings . " The patrol departed ; Reith , Anacho , and Traz went into the inn . As they supped Reith told of his arrangements with Zarfo Detwiler . " Tomorrow , if all goes well , we depart Settra . " " By no means too soon , " remarked Anacho sourly . " True . Already I 've been spied on by the Wankh , persecuted by the gentry , shot at by the ' cult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A boy wearing dark red livery came up to their table . " Adam Reith ? " " Who wants him ? " Reith asked warily . " I have a message . " " Give it here . " Reith tore apart the folded paper , puzzled out the sense of the florid symbols : The Security Company sends greetings . Be it known that , since you , Adam Reith , have attacked an authorized employee in the innocent pursuit of his duties , spoiling his equipment and inflicting pain and inconvenience , we demand a retributive fee of eighteen thousand sequins . If the sum is not immediately paid at our main office , you will be killed by a combination of several processes . Your prompt cooperation will be appreciated . Please do not depart Settra or seek to deny us in any way , as in that case the penalties must be amplified . Reith flung the letter down on the table . " Dordolio , the Wankh , Lord Cizante , and Helsse , the ' cult , ' the Security Company : who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly be soon enough . " p 239 10 ' l'lfE FOLLOWING MORNING Reith communicated with Blue Jade Palace by means of the queer Yao telephones , and was allowed to speak to Helsse . " You have naturally canceled the contract with the Security Company ? " " The contract has been canceled . I understand that they have decided to take independent action , which of course you must deal with as you see fit . " " Exactly , " said Reith . " We are leaving Settra at once and we accept Lord Cizante 's offer of assistance . " Helsse made a noncommittal sound . " What are your plans ? " " Essentially , to escape Settra with our lives . " " I will arrive shortly and take you to an outlying wheelway station . At Vervodei ships leave daily for all quarters and no doubt you will be able to make a convenient departure . " " We will be ready at noon , or before . " Reith set out on foot for the Cercade , taking all precautions , and arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been followed . Zarfo stood waiting , his white hair confined in a bonnet as black as his face . He immediately led the way to the cellar of an ale house . They sat at a stone table ; Zarfo signaled the pot-boy and they were presently served heavy stone mugs of a bitter earthy ale . Zarfo came quickly to business . " Before I disrupt my life by so much as a twitch , show me the color of your money . " Without words Reith threw down ten strips of winking purple sequins . " Aha ! " gloated Zarfo Detwiler . " This is true beauty ! Is it to be mine ? I will take custody of it at once , and guard it from all harm . " " Who will guard you ? " asked Reith . " Tish , tush , lad , " scoffed Zarfo . " If comrades ca n't trust comrades in a cool ale-cellar , how will it go under adversity ? " Reith returned the money to his wallet . " Adversity is here now . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking revenge upon you , they have threatened me . " " Yes , they are an unreasonable lot . If they demand money , defy them . A man can always fight for his life . " " I 've been warned not to leave Settra until such a time as they  | choose to kill me . Nevertheless , I propose to depart , and as soonas possible . " " Shrewd . " Zarfo quaffed ale and set the mug down with a thud . " But how will you evade the assassins ? Naturally they ponder your every move . " Reith jerked around at a noise , only to find the pot-boy at hand to refill Zarfo 's mug . Zarfo pulled at his long black nose to conceal a grin . " The assassins are pertinacious , but we shall outwit them , one way or another . Return to your hotel and make all ready . At noon I will join you and we shall see what we shall see . " Noon ? So late ? " " What difference an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Reith returned to the inn , where Helsse had already arrived in the black landau . The atmosphere was strained and taut ; at the sight of Reith , Helsse jumped to his feet . " Time is short ; we have been waiting ! Come ; we have only enough time to catch the first afternoon car for Vervodei ! " Reith asked : " Wo n't the assassins be expecting just this ? It seems an unimaginative plan . " Helsse gave an irritable shrug . " Do you have a better idea ? " " I 'd like to work one out . " Anacho asked , " Does Lord Cizante keep an air-car ? " " It is not in operation . " " Are any others available ? " " For a purpose of this sort ? I should think not . " Five minutes passed . Helsse said mildly , " The longer we wait , the less time remains to you . " He pointed out of the window . " See the two men in the round hats ? They wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the car . " " Go out and tell them to go away , " suggested Reith . Helsse laughed . " Not I. " Another half an hour went by . Zarfo swaggered into the foyer . He saluted the group with a wave of the hand . " Are all ready ? " Reith pointed to the assassins standing to the side of the Oval . " They are waiting for us . " " Detestable creatures , " said Zarfo . " Only in Cath would they be tolerated . " He looked sidelong at Helsse . " Why is he here ? " Reith explained the circumstances ; Zarfo looked out upon the Oval . " The black car with the silver and blue crest  --  is that the p 241 vehicle in question ? If so , nothing is simpler . We shall ride off in the car . " " Not feasible , " said Helsse . " Why not ? " asked Reith . " Lord Cizante does not care to become involved in this matter , nor do I. At the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Reith laughed bitterly . " When you contracted with them in the first place ? Out to the car , and drive us away from this city of madmen ! " After a moment of incredulous disdain , Helsse gave a curt nod . " As you wish . " The group left the inn and walked to the car . The assassins came forward . " I believe that you , sir , are Adam Reith ? " " What of it ? " " May we inquire your destination ? " " The Blue Jade Palace . " " Correct , " said Helsse tonelessly . " You understand our regulations and schedule of penalties ? " " Yes , of course . " The assassins muttered together , then one said : " In this case we think it advisable to accompany you . " " There is no room , " said Helsse in a cool voice . The assassins paid no heed . One started to enter the landau . Zarfo pulled him back . The assassin looked over his shoulder . " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I am a Lokhar . " Zarfo struck him a great clout , sending him sprawling . The second assassin stood astounded , then snatched forth a gun . Anacho 's sting snapped forth , to penetrate his chest . The first assassin tried to crawl away ; Zarfo gave him a tremendous kick under the chin ; he fell flat and limp . " Into the car , " said Zarfo . " It is time to leave . " " What a fiasco , " whispered Helsse . " I am ruined . " " Away from Settra ! " cried Zarfo . " By the least obvious route ! " The landau rolled along narrow streets , into a narrow lane , and presently out into the countryside . " Where are you taking us ? " demanded Reith . " Vervodei . " " Ridiculous ! " snorted Zarfo . " Drive east into the back coun-  | try . We must make our way to the Jinga River and fare downstream to Kabasas on the Parapan . " Helsse tried a voice of calm reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will stop . We have no spare energy cells . " " No difference ! " " Not to you . But how will I return to Settra ? " " Is this your plan , after what has happened ? " Helsse muttered something under his breath . " I am a marked man . They will demand fifty thousand sequins , which I can not pay  --  all through your insane manipulations . " " Whatever you like . But continue east , until the car stops or the road gives out  --  whichever first . " Helsse made a gesture of fateful despair . The road led through a weirdly beautiful flatland with slow streams and ponds to either side . Trees with drooping black limbs trailed tobacco-brown foliage into the water . Reith kept a lookout to the rear , but discovered no sign of pursuit . Settra became one with the murk of distance . Helsse no longer seemed to be sulking , but watched the road ahead with an expression that almost seemed anticipation . Reith became suddenly suspicious . " Stop a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What lies ahead ? " " The mountains . " " Why is the road in such good repair ? There seems to be no great traffic . " " Ho ! " crowed Zarfo . " The mountain camp for insane folk ! It must lie ahead ! " Helsse contrived a sickly grin . " You told me to drive you to the end of the road ; you did not stipulate that I should avoid taking you to the asylum . " " I do so now , " said Reith . " Please , no more innocent errors of this sort . " Helsse compressed his lips and once more began to brood . At a crossroad he swung south . The ground began to rise . Reith asked , " Where does the road lead ? " " To the old quicksilver mines , to mountain retreats , a few peasant holdings . " Into a forest hung with black moss rolled the car , and the road slanted up even more steeply . The sun passed behind a cloud , the forest became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meadow . p 243 Helsse glanced at an indicator . " An hour more of energy . " Reith indicated the thrust of mountains ahead . " What lies beyond ? " " Wilderness . The Hoch Har tribes . Black Mountain Lake , source of the Jinga . The route is neither safe nor convenient . It is , however , an exit from Cath . " Across the meadow they drove . Thick-trunked trees rose at intervals with leaves like shelves of yellow fungus . The road began to fail , and in places was blocked by fallen boughs . The ridge loomed above , a great rocky jut . At an abandoned mine the road ended . Simultaneously the power index reached zero . The car halted with a thud and a bump ; there was silence except for a sigh of wind . The group alighted with their meager possessions . The fog had dissipated ; the sun shone cool through a high overcast , washing the landscape in honey-colored light . Reith surveyed the mountainside , tracing a path to the ridge . He turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Kabasas , or back to Settra ? " " Settra , naturally . " He looked disconsolately at the car . " Afoot ? " " Better than afoot to Kabasas . " " What of the assassins ? " " I must take my chances . " Reith brought out his scanscope and studied the way they had come . " There seems no sign of pursuit ; you ? " He halted , surprised by the expression on Helsse 's face . " What is that object ? " demanded Helsse . Reith explained . " Dordolio spoke accurately , " said Helsse in a wondering voice . " He was telling the truth ! " Half-amused , half-annoyed , Reith said , " I do n't know what Dordolio told you , other than that we were barbarians . Goodbye , then , and my regards to Lord Cizante . " " Wait a moment , " said Helsse , staring indecisively west toward Settra . " Kabasas may be safer , after all . The assassins would be sure to consider me an auxiliary to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain , heaved a gloomy sigh . " Total insanity , of course . " " Needless to say , we are not here by our own volition , " returned Reith . " Well , we might as well start . "  | They climbed the tailings dump in front of the mine , peered into the tunnel , from which issued an ooze of reddish slime . A set of footprints led into the tunnel . They were about human size , the shape of a bowling pin or a gourd ; two inches ahead of the narrow forward end were three indentations as of toes . Looking down at the marks Reith felt the hairs rise at the nape of his neck . He listened , but no sounds came from the tunnel . He asked Traz , " What sort of prints are these ? " " An unshod Phung , possibly  --  a small one . More likely a Pnume . The prints are fresh . It watched our approach . " " Come along ; let 's leave , " muttered Reith . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over the panorama . The land to the west lay drowned in late afternoon murk , with Settra showing as a discolored spot , like a bruise . Far to the east glimmered Black Mountain Lake . The travelers spent an eerie night at the edge of the forest , starting up at far noises ; a thin uncanny screaming , a rap-rap-rap , like blows against a block of hard wood , the crafty hooting of night-hounds . Dawn came at last . The group made a glum breakfast on pods from a pilgrim plant , then proceeded down over a basalt palisade to the floor of a wooded valley . Ahead lay the Black Mountain Lake , calm and still . A fishing boat inched across the water and presently disappeared behind a jut of rock . " Hoch Har , " said Helsse . " Ancient enemies of the Yao . Now they remain behind the mountains . " Traz pointed . " A path . " Reith looked . " I see no path . " " Nevertheless it is there , and I smell wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five minutes later Traz made a sudden gesture . " Several men are approaching . " Reith listened ; he could hear nothing . But presently three men appeared on the trail ahead : very tall men with thick waists , thin arms and legs , wearing skirts of a dirty white fiber and short capes of the same stuff . They stopped short at the sight of the travelers , then turned and retreated along the trail , looking anxiously back over their shoulders . After a quarter-mile the trail left the jungle , and angled off across the swampy foreshore of the lake . The Hoch Har village p 245 on stilts over the water , terminating in a float to which a n plank boats were tied . On the shore a score of men stood in ttitudes of nervous truculence , striding back and forth , bushknives and long spring-bows at the ready . The travelers approached . The tallest and heaviest of Hoch Hars called out in a ridiculously shrill voice : " Who are you ? " " Travelers on the way to Kabasas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the until toward the mountains . " Where is the rest of your band ? " " There is no band ; we are alone . Can you sell us a boat and some food ? " The Hoch Hars put aside their weapons . " Food is hard to Mme by , " groaned the first man . " Boats are bur dearest possesions . What can you offer us in exchange ? " " Only a few sequins . " " What good are sequins when we must visit Cath to spend ? " Helsse muttered in Reith 's ear . Reith said to the Hoch Hars , ery well then , we shall continue . I understand that there are er villages around the lake . " " What ? Would you deal with petty thieves and cheats ? It is all e folks are . Well , to save you from your own folly , we will train ourselves to work out some sort of arrangement . " In the end Reith paid two hundred sequins for a boat in fair dition and what the Hoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all the way to Kabasas : crates of ed fish , sacks of tubers , rolls of pepper-bark , fresh and prerved fruit . Another thirty sequins secured the services , as a ide , of a certain Tsutso , a moon-faced young man somewhat portly , with an affable big-toothed smile . Tsutso declared the first stages of their journey to be the most precarious : " First , the raps ; then the Great Slant , after which the voyage becomes no pore than drifting downstream to Kabasas . " At noon , with the small sail set , the boat departed the Hoch liar village , and through the long afternoon sailed the dark water youth toward a pair of bluffs which marked the outlet of the lake d the head of the Jinga River . At sunset the boat passed beeen the bluffs , each crowned by a tumble of ruins , black on the brown-ash sky . Under the bluff to the right was a small cove with a beach ; here Reith wanted to camp for the night but Tsutso  | would not hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight the ghosts of old Tschai walk the pavings . Do you want us all put under a taint ? " " So long as the ghosts keep to the castle , what 's to prevent us from using the cove ? " Tsutso gave Reith a wondering look , and held the boat to midstream between the opposing ruins . A mile downstream the Jinga split around a rocky islet , to which Tsutso took the boat . " Here nothing from the forest can molest us . " The travelers supped , laid themselves down around the campfire and were troubled by no more than soft whistles and trills from the forest , and once , far in the distance , the mournful call of the night-hounds . On the next day they passed across ten miles of violent rapids , during which Tsutso ten times over earned his fee , in Reith 's estimation . Meanwhile the forest dwindled to clumps of thorn ; the banks became barren , and presently a strange sound made itself heard from ahead : a sibilant all-pervading roar . " The Slant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brink a hundred yards ahead . Before Reith or the others could protest , the boat had pitched over the verge . Tsutso said , " Everyone alert ; here is the Slant . Hold to the middle ! " The roar of water almost overwhelmed his voice . The boat was sliding into a dark gorge ; with amazing velocity the rock walls passed astern . The river itself was a trembling black surface , lined with foam static in relation to the boat . The travelers crouched as low as possible , ignoring Tsutso 's condescending grin . For minutes they dashed down the race , finally plunged into a field of foam and froth , then floated smoothly out into still water . The walls rose sheer a thousand feet : brown sandstone pocked with balls of black starbush . Tsutso steered the boat to a fringe of shingle . " Here I leave you . " " Here ? At the bottom of this canyon ? " Reith asked in wonder . Tsutso pointed to a trail winding up the slope . " Five miles away is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Reith , " goodbye and many thanks . " Tsutso made an indulgent gesture . " It is nothing in particular . Hoch Hars are generous folk , except where the Yao are concerned . Had you been Yao , all might not have gone so well . " p 247 Reith looked toward Helsse , who said nothing . " The Yao are your enemies ? " " Our ancient persecutors , who destroyed the Hoch Har empire . Now they keep to their side of the mountain , which is well for them , as we can smell out a Yao like a bad fish . " He jumped nimbly ashore . " The swamps lie ahead . Unless you lose yourpelves or arouse the swamp-people you are as good as at Kaba- . " With a final wave he started up the path . The boat drifted through sepia gloom , the sky.a watered silk ribbon high above . The afternoon passed , with the walls of the chasm gradually opening out . At sunset the travelers camped on a small beach , to pass a night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a wide valley overgrown with tall yellow grass . The hills retreated ; the vegetation along the shore became thick and dense , and alive with small creatures , half-spider , half-monkey , which whined and yelped and spurted jets of noxious fluid toward the boat . Other streams made confluence ; the Jinga became broad and placid . On the following day trees of remarkable stature appeared along the shore , raising a variety of silhouettes against the smoke-brown sky , and by noon the boat floated with jungle to either side . The sail hung limp ; the air was dank with odors of wet wood and decay . The hopping tree-creatures kept to the high branches ; through the dimness below drifted gauze-moths , insects hanging on pale bubbles , bird-like creatures which seemed to swim on four soft wings . Once the travelers heard heavy groaning and trampling sounds , another time a ferocious hissing and again a set of strident shrieks , from sources invisible . By slow degrees the Jinga broadened to become a placid flood , flowing around dozens of small islands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once , from the corner of his eye , Reith glimpsed what seemed to be a canoe carrying three youths wearing peacock-tail headdresses , but when he turned to look he saw only an island , and was never sure what in fact he had seen . Later in the day a sinuous twenty-foot beast swam after them , but fifty feet from the boat it seemed to lose interest and submerged . At sundown the travelers made camp on the beach of a small island . Half an hour later Traz became uneasy and , nudging Reith , pointed to the underbrush . They heard a stealthy rustling  | and presently sensed a clammy odor . An instant later the beast which had swum after them lunged forth screaming . Reith fired one of his explosive pellets into the very maw of the beast ; with its head blown off it careened in a circle , using a peculiar prancing gait , finally floundering in the water to sink . The group gingerly resumed their seats around the campfire . Helsse watched Reith return the handgun to his pouch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may I ask , did you obtain your weapon ? " " I have learned , " said Reith , " that candor makes problems . Your friend Dordolio thinks me a lunatic ; Anacho the Dirdirman prefers the term ' amnesiac . ' So  --  think whatever you like . " Helsse murmured , as if for his own ears : " What strange tales we all could tell , if candor indeed were the rule . " Zarfo guffawed . " Candor ? Who needs it ? I 'll tell strange tales as long as someone will listen . " " No doubt , " said Helsse , " but persons with desperate goals must hold their secrets close . " Traz , who disliked Helsse , looked sideways with something like a sneer . " Who could this be ? I have neither secrets nor desperate goals . " " It must be the Dirdirman , " said Zarfo with a sly wink . Anacho shook his head . " Secrets ? No . Only reticences . Desperate goals ? I travel with Adam Reith since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the sub-men . I have no goals whatever , except survival . " Zarfo said , " I have a secret : the location of my poor hoard of sequins . My goals ? Equally modest : an acre or two of river meadow south of Smargash , a cabin under the tayberry trees , a polite maiden to boil my tea . I recommend them to you . " Helsse , looking into the campfire , smiled faintly . " My every thought , willy-nilly , is a secret . As for my goals  --  if I return to Settra and somehow can appease the Security Company , I 'll be well content . " Reith looked up to where clouds were clotting out the stars . " I 'll be content to stay dry tonight . " The group carried the boat ashore , turned it over and , with the sail , made a shelter . Rain began to fall , extinguishing the campfire and sending puddles of water under the boat . Dawn finally arrived : a blear of rain and umber gloom . At p @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelers once more floated the boat , loaded the provisions and set off to the south . The Jinga widened until the shores were no more than dark marks . The afternoon passed ; sunset was a vast chaos of black , gold , and brown . Drifting through the gloom , the travelers sought for a place to land . Mud flats lined the shore , but at last , as purple-brown dusk became night , a sandy bluff appeared under which the travelers landed for the night . On the following day they entered the swamps . The Jinga , dividing into a dozen channels , moved sluggishly among islands of reeds , and the travelers passed a cramped night in the boat . Toward evening of the day following they came upon a canted dyke of gray schist which , rising and falling , created a chain of rocky islands across the swamp . At some immensely remote time , one or another people of old Tschai had used the islands to support a causeway , long toppled to a crumble of black concrete . On the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried fish and musty lentils provided by the Hoch Hars . Traz was restless . He made a circuit of the island , clambered to the highest jut , looked back and forth along the line of the ancient bridge . Reith , disturbed by Traz 's apprehension , joined him . " What do you see ? " " Nothing . " Reith looked all around . The water reflected the dusky mauve of the sky , the hulks of the nearby islands . They returned to the campfire , and Reith set sentry watches . He awoke at dawn and instantly wondered why he had not been called . Then he noticed that the boat was gone . He shook Traz , who had stood the first watch . " Last night , whom did you call ? " " Helsse . " " He did not call me . And the boat is missing . " " And Helsse as well , " said Traz . Reith saw this to be the case . Traz pointed to the next island , forty yards across the water . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row . " Going down to the water 's edge Reith called : " Helsse ! Helsse ! " No response . Helsse was not visible . Reith considered the distance to the boat . The water was smooth and opaque as slate . Reith shook his head . The boat so near , so obvious : bait ? From his pouch he took the hank of cord ,  | originally a component of his survival kit , and tied a stone to one end . He heaved the stone at the boat . It fell short . Reith dragged it back through the water . For an instant the line went taut and quivered to the presence of something strong and vital . Reith grimaced . He heaved the stone again , and now it wedged inside the boat . He pulled ; the boat came back across the water . With Traz , Reith returned to the neighboring island , to find no trace of Helsse . But under a jut of rock they found a hole slanting down into the island . Traz put his head close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do the same . Reith caught a faint clammy odor , like that of earthworms . In a subdued voice he called down into the hole : " Helsse ! " and once again , louder : " Helsse ! " To no effect . They returned to their companions . " It seems that the Pnume play jokes , " said Reith in a subdued voice . They ate a silent breakfast , waited an indecisive fidgeting hour . Then slowly they loaded the boat and departed the island . Reith looked back through the scanscope until the island no longer could be seen . 11 THE CHANNELS OF the Jinga came together ; the swamp became a jungle . Fronds and tendrils hung over the black water ; giant moths floated like ghosts . The upper strata of the forest were a distinct environment : pink and pale yellow ribbons writhed through the air like eels ; black-furred globes with six long white arms swung nimbly from branch to branch . Once , far off along an avenue of vision , Reith saw a cluster of large woven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat passed under a bridge of sticks and coarse ropes . Three naked people came to cross the bridge as the boat drifted close : frail thin-bodied folk with parch-ment-colored skin . Observing the boat , they halted in shock , then raced across the bridge and disappeared into the foliage . For a week they sailed and paddled uneventfully , the Jinga growing ever wider . One day they passed a canoe from which an old man netted fish ; the next day they saw a village on the banks ; the day after a power-boat throbbed past . On the night following SERVANTS OF THE WANKH 0 251 Ity halted at a town and spent the night in a riverside inn , standon stilts over the water . Two more days they sailed downstream , to a brisk wind from fern . The Jinga was now wide and deep and the wind raised kable waves . Navigation began to be a problem . Coming to anther town they saw a river packet headed downstream ; abananing the boat they took passage for Kabasas on the Parapan . Three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fresh food . At noon on the fourth day , with the Jinga broad that the far shore could not be seen , the blue domes of ? basas appeared on rising land to the west . abasas , like Coad , served as a commercial depot for extensive terlands and like Coad seemed to seethe with intrigue . Wareses and sheds faced the docks ; behind , ranks of arched and plonnaded buildings , of beige , gray , white and dark blue plasir , mounted the hills . A wall of each building , for reasons never dear to Reith , leaned either inward or out , giving the city a curilusly irregular appearance by no means dissonant with the conluct of the inhabitants . These were a slender alert people , with owing brown hair , wide cheekbones , burning black eyes . The voman were notably handsome and Zarfo cautioned all : " If you value your lives , pay no heed to the women ! Do not so much as Dok after them , even though they provoke and tease ! They play a trange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they set Ip furious outcry and a hundred other women , screaming and ursing , rush up to knife the miscreant . " " Hmmf , " said Reith . " And the men ? " " They 'll save you if they can , and beat the women off , which uits all parties very well . Indeed this is the way of courtship . A an desiring a girl will set upon her and beat her black and blue . do one would think to interfere . If the girl approves , she comes he same way again . When he rushes forth to pummel her , she hrows herself on his mercy . Such is the painful wooing of the abs . " " It seems somewhat awkward , " said Reith . " Exactly . Awkward and perverse . Such are affairs in Kabasas. ) wring our stay you had best rely on my counsel . First , I nomiwte the Sea Dragon Inn as a base of operations . " " We 'll hardly be here that long . Why not go directly to the lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | Zarfo pulled at his long black nose . " Things are never so easy ! And why cheat ourselves of a sojourn at the Sea Dragon Inn ? ... Perhaps a week or two . " " You naturally intend to pay for your own accommoda-tions ? " Zarfo 's white eyebrows dipped sharply . " I am as you know a poor man . My every sequin represents toil . On a joint venture et this sort openhanded generosity should certainly be the rule . " " Tonight , " said Reith , " we stay at the Sea Dragon Inn . Tomorrow we leave Kabasas . " Zarfo gave a dismal grunt . " It is not my place to dispute your wishes . Hmmf . As I understand the matter , you plan to arrive at Smargash , recruit a team of technicians , then continue to Ao Hidis ? " " Correct . " " Discretion then ! I suggest that we take ship to Zara across the Parapan and up the Ish River . You have not lost your money ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The thieves of Kabasas are deft ; they use thongs which reach out thirty feet . " Zarfo pointed . " Observe that structure just above the beach ? The Sea Dragon Inn ! " The Sea Dragon Inn was indeed a grand establishment , with wide public rooms and pleasant sleeping cubicles . The restaurant was decorated to suggest a submarine garden , even to the dark grottos where members of a local sect , who would not publicly perform the act of deglutition , were served . Reith ordered fresh linen from the staff haberdashery and descended to the great bath on the low terrace . He scrubbed himself and was sprayed with tonic and massaged with handfuls of fragrant moss . Wrapping himself in a gown of white linen he returned to his chamber . On the couch sat a man in a soiled dark blue suit . Reith stared . Helsse looked back at him with an unfathomable expression . He made no move and uttered no sound . The silence was intense . Reith slowly backed from the room , to stand uncertainly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost . Zarfo appeared , swaggering back to his room with white hair billowing . Reith signaled to him . " Come , I want to show you some- p 253 thing . " He took Zarfo to the door , thrust it ajar , half-expecting to find the room unoccupied . Helsse sat as before . Zarfo whispered : " Is he mad ? He sits and stares and mocks us but does not speak . " " Helsse , " said Reith . " What are you doing here ? What happened to you ? " Helsse rose to his feet . Reith and Zarfo moved involuntarily back . Helsse looked at them with the faintest of smiles . He stepped out on the balcony , walked slowly to the stairs . He turned his head ; Reith and Zarfo saw the pale oval of his face ; then , like an apparition , he was gone . " What is the meaning of all this ? " Reith asked in a husky voice . Zarfo shook his head , for once subdued . " The Pnume love their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He could have stayed , had he wished . " " But  --  I doubt if he is sane . " Zarfo 's only response was a hunch-shouldered shrug . Reith went to the edge of the balcony , looked out over the town . " The Pnume know the very rooms in which we sleep ! " " A person floating down the Jinga ends up at Kabasas , " said Zarfo testily . " If he is able , he patronizes the Sea Dragon Inn . This is not an intricate deduction . So much for Pnume omniscience . " On the following day Zarfo went off by himself and presently returned with a short man with skin the color of mahogany , walking with a sore-footed swagger as if his shoes were too tight . His face was seamed and crooked ; small nervous eyes looked slantwise past the beak of his nose . " And here , " declared Zarfo grandly , " I give you Sealord Dobagq Hrostilfe , a person of sagacity , who will arrange everything . " Reith thought that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commands the Pibar , " explained Zarfo . " For a most reasonable sum he will deliver us to our destination , be it the far coast of Vord . " " How much across the Parapan ? " Reith asked . " Only five thousand sequins , would you believe it ? " exclaimed Zarfo . Reith laughed scornfully . He turned to Zarfo : " I need your help no longer . You and your friend Hrostilfe can try to swindle someone else . "  | " What ? " cried Zarfo . " After I risked my life in that infernal chute and endured all manner of hardship ? " But Reith had walked away . Zarfo came after him , somewhat crestfallen . " Adam Reith , you have made a serious mistake . " Reith nodded grimly . " Instead of an honest man I hired you . " Zarfo swelled up indignantly . " Who dares name me other than honest ? " " I do . Hrostilfe would rent his boat for a hundred sequins . He gave you a price of five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both profit ? Adam Reith is credulous . I 'll name a price and anything over a thousand sequins is mine . ' So , be off with you . " Zarfo pulled ruefully at his black nose . " You do me vast wrong . I have only just come from chiding Hrostilfe , who admitted knavery . He now offers his boat at " ? Zarfo cleared his throat ? " twelve hundred sequins . " " Not a bice more than three hundred . " Zarfo threw his hands into the air and stalked away . Not long after Hrostilfe himself appeared with the plea that Reith inspect his ship . Reith followed him to the Pibar : a jaunty craft forty feet long , powered by electrostatic jet . Hrostilfe kept up a halfhectoring , half-plaintive commentary . " A fast seaworthy vessel ! Your price is absurd . What of my skills , my sea-lore ? Do you appreciate the cost of energy ? The voyage will exhaust a power cell : a hundred sequins which I can not afford . You must pay for energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I can not subsidize you . " Reith agreed to pay for energy and a reasonable amount for provisions , but not the installation of new water tanks , extra foulweather gear , good-luck fetishes for the prow ; furthermore he insisted on departure the following day , at which Hrostilfe gave a sour chuckle . " There 's one in the eye for the old Lokhar . He had counted on swanking it a week or more at the Sea Dragon . " " He can stay as long as he likes , " said Reith , " provided that he pays . " " Small chance of that , " chuckled Hrostilfe . " Well then , what about provisions ? " " Buy them . Show me an itemized tally , which I will check in detail . " " I need an advance : a hundred sequins . " " Do you take me for a fool ? Remember , tomorrow noon we sail . " p 255 " The Pibar will be ready , " said Hrostilfe in a sullen voice . Returning to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anacho pointed to a black-haired shape leaning against seawall . " There he stands : Helsse . I called him by name . It as as if he never heard . " Helsse turned his head ; his face seemed deathly white . For a oment or two he watched them , then turned and walked wly away . t noon the travelers embarked on the Pibar . Hrostilfe gave his sengers a brisk welcome . Reith looked skeptically here and re , wondering in what fashion Hrostilfe thought he had won vantage for himself . " Where are the provisions ? " " In the main saloon . " Reith examined boxes and crates , checked them against Hros-e 's tally sheet , and was forced to admit that Hrostilfe had ured good merchandise at no great price . But why , he wonred , were they not stored forward in the lazaret ? He tried the r , and found it locked . Interesting , thought Reith . He called Hrostilfe : " Best to stow stores forward in the lazaret , before we start pitching to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared Hrostilfe . " First things first ! ow it 's important that we make the most of the morning cur-t ! " " But it will only require a moment . Here , open the door ; I will o it myself . " Hrostilfe made a waggish gesture . " I am the most finicky of Kamen . Everything must be done just so . " Zarfo , who had come into the saloon , gave the lazaret door a culative frown . Reith said , " Very well then , just as you like . " rfo started to speak but catching Reith 's gaze , shrugged and held his tongue . Hrostilfe nimbly hopped here and there , casting off lines , starting the jet , and finally jumping into the control pulpit . The boat surged out to sea . Reith spoke to Traz , who went to stand behind Hrostilfe. ringing forth his catapult Traz checked its action , dropped a It into the slot , cocked it and hung it loosely at his belt . Hrostilfe grimaced . " Careful , boy ! A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed not to hear . Reith , after a word or two with Zarfo and Anacho , went to the foredeck . Setting fire to some old rags , he held them in the forward ventilator , so that smoke poured down into the lazaret . Hrostilfe cried out in anger : " What nonsense is this ? Are you trying to set us afire ? " Reith set more rags burning and dropped them into the venti lator . From below came a choked cough , then a mutter of voices and a stamping of feet . Hrostilfe jerked his hand toward his pouch , but noticed Traz 's intent gaze and his ready catapult . Reith sauntered aft . Traz said , " His weapon is in his pouch . " Hrostilfe stood rigid with dismay . He made a sudden move but stopped short as Traz jerked up the catapult . Reith detached the pouch , handed it to Traz , took two daggers and a poniard from various parts of Hrostilfe 's person . " Go below , " said Reith . " Open the door to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time . " Hrostilfe , gray-faced with fury , hopped below and , after an exchange of threats with Reith , opened the door . Six ruffians came forth , to be disarmed by Anacho and Zarfo and sent up to the deck where Reith thrust them over the side . The lazaret at last was empty of all but smoke . Hrostilfe was hustled up on deck , where he became unctuous and overreasonable . " All can be explained ! A ridiculous misunderstand-ing ! " But Reith refused to listen and Hrostilfe joined his fellows over the side , where , after shaking his fist and bellowing obscenities at the grinning faces aboard the Pibar , he struck out for the shore . " It appears , " said Reith , " that we now lack a navigator . In what direction lies Zara ? " Zarfo 's manner was very subdued . He pointed a gnarled black finger . " That should be our heading . " He turned to look aft toward the seven bobbing heads . " Incomprehensible to me , the greed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " And Zarfo gave a sanctimonious cluck of the tongue . " Well then , an unfortunate incident , happily in the past . And now we command the Pibar ! Ahead : Zara , the Ish River , and Smargash ! "  | 12 All DURING THE first day the Parapan was serene . The second ay was brisk with the Pibar pitching up and over a short chop . the third day a black-brown cloud loomed out of the west , tabbing the sea with lightning . Wind came in massive gusts ; for o hours the Pibar heaved and tossed ; then the storm passed er , and the Pibar drove into clement weather . On the fourth day Kachan loomed ahead . Reith steered the ibar alongside a fishing craft and Zarfo asked the direction of ra . The fisherman , a swarthy old man with steel rings in his ars , pointed wordlessly . The Pibar surged forward , entering the estuary at sunset . The lights of Zara flickered along the westshore , but now , with no reason to put into port , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon Az shone on the water ; all night the Pibar rove . Morning found them in a rich country with rows of stately 1 trees along the banks . Then the land began to grow barren , d for a space the river wound through a cluster of obsidian ires . On the next day a band of tall men in black cloaks were n on the riverbank . Zarfo identified them as Niss tribesmen . ey stood motionless , watching the Pibar surge upstream . ' Give them a wide berth ! They live in holes like night-hounds d some say the night-hounds are kinder . " Late in the afternoon sand dunes closed in upon the river and rfo insisted that the Pibar be anchored in deep water for the ght . " Ahead are sandbars and shallows . We would be certain run aground and undoubtedly the Niss have followed . They ould grapple the boat and swarm aboard . " " Wo n't they attack us if we lay at anchor ? " " No , they fear deep water and never use boats . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Smargash . " The night was clear with both Az and Braz wheeling through e sky of old Tschai . On the riverbank the Niss boldly lit their fires and boiled their pots , and later started up a wild music of fiddles and drums . For hours the travelers sat watching the agile shapes in black cloaks dancing around the fires , kicking , jumping , heads up , heads low ; swinging , whirling , prancing with arms akimbo . In the morning the Niss were nowhere to be seen . The Pibar  | passed through the shallows without incident . Late in the afternoon the travelers came to a village , guarded from the Niss by a line of posts to each of which was chained a skeleton in a rotting black cloak . Zarfo declared the village to be the feasible limit of navigation with Smargash yet three hundred miles south , across a land of deserts , mountain pinnacles and chasms . " Now we must travel by caravan , over the old Sarsazm Road , to Hamil Zut under the Lokhara Uplands . Tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage . " Zarfo stayed ashore overnight , returning in the morning with the news that by dint of the most furious bargaining he had exchanged the Pibar for first class passage by caravan to Hamil Zut . Reith calculated . Three hundred miles ? Two hundred sequins a person , at maximum : eight hundred for the four . The Pibar was worth ten thousand , even at a sacrifice price . He looked at Zarfo , who ingenuously returned the gaze . " You will recall , " said Reith , " the ill feeling and dissension at Kabasas ? " " Of course , " declared Zarfo . " To this day I become anguished by the injustice of your hints . " " Here is another hint . How much extra did you demand for the Pibar  --  and receive ? " Zarfo gave an uneasy grimace . " Naturally , I was saving the news to be a glad surprise . " " How much ? " " Three thousand sequins , " muttered Zarfo . " No more , no less . I consider it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Reith allowed the figure to pass without challenge . " Where is the money ? " " It will be paid when we go ashore . " " And when does the caravan leave ? " " Soon  --  a day or so . There is a passable inn ; we can spend the night ashore . " " Very well ; let us all go now and collect the money . " Somewhat to Reith 's surprise the sack which Zarfo received from the innkeeper contained exactly three thousand sequins , and Zarfo gave a sour sneer and , going into the tavern , called for a pot of ale . Three days later the caravan started south : a file of twelve power wagons , four mounted with sandblasts . Sarsazm Road led through awesome scenery : gorges and great precipices , the bed of an ancient sea , vistas of distant mountains , sighing forests of p 259 keel and blackfern . Occasionally Niss were sighted but they kept their distance and on the evening of the third day the caravan pulled into Hamil Zut , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen taverns . In the morning Zarfo engaged pack-beasts , equipment and a pair of guides , and the travelers set forth up the trail into the Lokharan highlands . " This is wild country , " Zarfo warned them . " Dangerous beasts are occasionally seen , so be ready with your weapons . " The trail was steep , the terrain indeed wild . On several occaons they sighted Kar Yan , subtle gray beasts slinking through e rocks , sometimes erect on two legs , sometimes dropping to all x . Another time they encountered a tiger-headed reptile gorging upon a carcass , and were able to pass unmolested . On the third day after leaving Hamil Zut , the travelers entered Lokhara , a great upland plain ; and in the mid-afternoon margash appeared ahead . Zarfo now told Reith : " It occurs to e , as it must have to you , that yours is a very ticklish venture . " " Agreed . " " Folk here are not indifferent to the Wankh , and a stranger alight easily talk to the wrong people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better for me to select the personnel . " " Certainly . But leave the question of payment to me . " " As you wish , " growled Zarfo . The countryside was now a prosperous well-watered land , populated by peasant farms . The men , like Zarfo , were tattooed or dyed black , with a mane of white hair . The skins of the women , in contradistinction , were chalky white , and their hair was black . Urchins showed white or black hair according to their sex , but their skins were uniformly the color of the dirt in which they played . A road ran on a riverbank , under majestic old keels . To either side were small bungalows , each in its bower of vines and shrubs . Zarfo sighed with vast feeling . " Observe me , the transient worker returning to his home . But where is my fortune ? How may I buy my cottage by the river ? Poverty has forced me to strange ways ; I am thrown in with a stone-hearted zealot , who takes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Reith paid no heed , and presently they entered Smargash.  | 13 REITH SAT IN the parlor of the squat cylindrical cottage he had rented , overlooking the Smargash common , where the young folk spent much time dancing . Across from him , in wicher chairs , sat five white-haired men of Smargash , a group screened from the twenty Zarfo originally had approached . The time was middle afternoon ; out on the common dancers skipped and kicked to music of concertina , bells and drums . Reith explained as much of his program as he dared : not a great deal . " You men are here because you can help me in a certain venture . Zarfo Detwiler has informed you that a large sum of money is involved ; this is true , even if we fail . If we succeed , and I believe the chances are favorable , you will earn wealth sufficient to satisfy any of you . There is danger , as might be expected , but we shall hold it to a minimum . If anyone does not care to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . " The oldest of the group , one Jag Jaganig , an expert in the overhaul and installation of control systems , said , " So far we ca n't say yes or no . None of us would refuse to drag home a sack of sequins , but neither would we care to challenge impossibility for a chancy bice . " " You want more information ? " Reith looked from face to face . " This is natural enough . But I do n't want to take the merely curious into my confidence . If any of you are definitely not disposed for a dangerous but by no means desperate venture , please identify yourself now . " There was a slight stir of uneasiness , but no one spoke out . Reith waited a moment . " Very well ; you must bind yourselves to secrecy . " The group bound themselves by awful Lokhar oaths . Zarfo , plucking a hair from each head , twisted a fiber which he set alight . Each inhaled the smoke . " So we are bound , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one will strike him down . " Reith , impressed by the ritual , had no more qualms about speaking to the point . " I know the exact location of a source of wealth , at a place not on the planet Tschai . We need a spaceship and a crew to operate it . I propose to commandeer a spaceship from the Ao Hidis field ; you men shall be the crew . To demon- p 261 I crate my sanity and good faith , I will pay to each man on the day of departure five thousand sequins . If we try but fail , each man receives another five thousand sequins . " " Each surviving man , " grumbled Jag Jaganig . Reith went on : " If we succeed , ten thousand sequins will seem like ten bice . Essentially , this is the scope of the venture . " The Lokhars shuffled dubiously in their chairs . Jag Jaganig spoke . " We obviously have the basis for an adequate crew here , at least for a Zeno , or a Kud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no small matter to so affront the Wankh . " " Or worse , the Wankhmen , " muttered Zorofim . " As I recall , " mused Thadzei , " no great vigilance prevailed . The scheme , while startling , seems feasible  --  provided that the ship we board is in operative condition . " " Aha ! " exclaimed Belje . " That ' provided that ' is the key to the entire exploit ! " Zarfo jeered : " Naturally there is risk . Do you expect money for nothing ? " " I can hope . " Jag Jaganig inquired : " Assume that the ship is ours . Is further risk entailed ? " " None . " " Who will navigate ? " " I will . " " In what form is this ' wealth ' ? " demanded Zorofim . " Gems ? Sequins ? Precious metal ? Antiques ? Essences ? " " I do n't care to go any further into detail , except to guarantee that you will not be disappointed . " The discussion proceeded , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alternative proposals were considered , argued , rejected . No one seemed to regard the risk as overwhelming , nor did anyone doubt the group 's ability to handle the ship . But none evinced enthusiasm . Jag Jaganig put the situation into focus . " We are puzzled , " he told Reith . " We do not understand your purposes . We are skeptical of boundless trea-sures . " Zarfo said , " Here I must speak . Adam Reith has his faults which I wo n't deny . He is stubborn and unwieldy ; he is crafty as a zut ; he is ruthless when opposed . But he is a man of his word . If he declares a treasure to exist for our taking , that aspect of the matter is closed . " 262 O JACK VANCE After a moment Belje muttered : " Desperate , desperate ! Who wants to learn the truth of the black boxes ? " " Desperate , no , " countered Thadzei . " Risky , yes , and may demons run off with the black boxes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zorofim . " I as well , " said Jag Jaganig . " Who lives forever ? " Belje finally capitulated and declared himself committed . " When shall we leave ? " " As soon as possible , " said Reith . " The longer I wait , the more nervous I get . " " And more the chance of someone else running off with our treasure , hey ? " exclaimed Zarfo . " That would be a sad case ! " " Give us three days to arrange our affairs , " said Jag Jaganig . " And what of the five thousand sequins ? " demanded Thadzei . " Why not distribute the money now , so that we may have the use of it ? " Reith hesitated no longer than a tenth of a second . " Since you must trust me , I must trust you . " He paid to each of the marveling Lokhars fifty purple sequins , worth a hundred white sequins each . " Excellent ! " declared Jag Jaganig . " Remember all ! Utter discretion ! Spies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the inn who dresses like a Yao . " " What ? " cried Reith . " A young man , black-haired , very ele-gant ? " " The person precisely . He stares out over the dancing field with never a word to say . " Reith , Zarfo , Anacho and Traz went to the inn . In the dim taproom sat Helsse , long legs in tight black twill breeches stretched under the heavy table . Brooding , he looked straight ahead and out the doorway to where black-skinned white-haired boys and white-skinned black-haired girls skipped and caracoled in the tawny sunlight . Reith said : " Helsse ! " Helsse never shifted his gaze . Reith came closer . " Helsse ! " Helsse slowly turned his head ; Reith looked into eyes like lenses of black glass . " Speak to me , " urged Reith . " Helsse ! Speak ! " Helsse opened his mouth , uttered a mournful croak . Reith SERVANTS OF THE WANKH 0 263 drew back . Helsse watched him incuriously , then returned to his inspection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his comrades to the side where Zarfo poured him a pot of ale . " What of the Yao ? Is he mad ? " " I do n't know . He might be feigning . Or under hypnotic control . Or drugged . " Zarfo took a long draft from his pot , wiped the foam from his nose . " The Yao might think it a favor were we to cure him . " " No doubt , " said Reith , " but how ? " " Why not call in a Dugbo practitioner ? " " What might that be ? " Zarfo jerked his thumb to the east . " The Dugbo have a camp back of town : shiftless folk in rags and tatters , given to thieving and vice , and musicians to boot . They worship demons , and their ractitioners perform miracles . " " So you think the Dugbo can cure Helsse ? " Zarfo drained his pot . " If he is feigning , I assure you he wo n't feign long . " Reith shrugged . " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Exactly my way of thinking , " said Zarfo . The Dugbo practitioner was a spindly little man dressed in brown rags and boots of uncured leather . His eyes were a luminous hazel , his russet hair was confined in three greasy knobs . On his cheek pale cicatrices worked and jumped as he spoke . He did not appear to consider Reith 's requirements surprising and with clinical curiosity studied Helsse , who sat sardonically indifferent in one of the wicker chairs . The practitioner approached Helsse , looked into his eyes , inspected his ears , and nodded as if a suspicion had been verified . He signaled the fat youth who assisted him , then ducking behind Helsse touched him here and there while the youth held a bottle of black essence under Helsse 's nose . Helsse presently became passive and relaxed into the chair . The practitioner set heaps of incense alight and fanned the fumes into Helsse 's face . Then , while the youth played a nose flute the practitioner sang : secret words , close to Helsse 's ears . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helsse furiously began to mold the clay and presently set up a mutter . The practitioner signaled to Reith . " A simple case of possession . Notice : the evil flows from the fingers into the clay . Talk to 264 O JACK VANCE him if you like . Be gentle but command , and he will answer you . " " Helsse , " said Reith , " describe your association with Adam Reith . " In a clear voice Helsse spoke . " Adam Reith came to Settra . There had been rumor and speculation , but when he arrived , all was different . By strange chance he came to Blue Jade , my personal vantage , and there I saw him first . Dordolio came after and in his rage maligned Reith as one of the ' cult ' : a man who fancied himself from the far world Home . I spoke with Adam Reith but learned only confusion . To clarify by acquiescence , third of the Ten Techniques , I took him to the headquarters of the ' cult ' and received contradictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not dramatically divert , sixth of the Techniques . Adam Reith killed the courier and took a message of unknown importance ; he would not allow me inspection ; I could not comfortably insist . I referred him to a Lokhar , again ' clarifying by acquies-cence ' : as it eventuated , the wrong technique . The Lokhar read far into the message . I ordered Reith assassinated . The attempt was bungled . Reith and his band fled south . I received instructions to accompany him and penetrate his motivations . We journeyed east to the Jinga River and downstream by boat . On an island ? " Helsse gave a gasping cry and sank back , rigid and trembling . The practitioner waved smoke into Helsse 's face and pinched his nose . " Return to the ' calm ' state , and henceforth , when your nose is pinched , return ; this shall be an absolute injunction . Now then , answer such questions as are put to you . " Reith asked , " Why do you spy on Adam Reith ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such work . " " Why are you obligated ? " " All Wankhmen must serve Destiny . " " Oho . You are a Wankhman ? " " Yes . " And Reith wondered how he could ever have thought otherwise . Tsutso and the Hoch Hars had not been deceived : " Had you been Yao , all would not have gone so well , " so had said Tsutso . Reith glanced ruefully at his comrades , then turned back to Helsse . " Why do the Wankhmen keep spies in Cath ? " " They watch the turn of the ' round ' ; they guard against a renascence of the ' cult . ' " " W ? ? y.  | It is a matter of stasis . Conditions now are optimum . Any nge can only be for the worse . " " You accompanied Adam Reith from Settra to an island in the amps . What happened there ? " Helsse once more croaked and became catatonic . The practiner tweaked his nose . Reith asked , " How did you travel to Kabasas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . " Tell us by you can not answer the questions ? " Helsse said nothing . He appeared to be conscious . The practiner fanned smoke in his face ; Reith tweaked his nose and , oing so , saw that Helsse 's eyes looked in separate directions . e practitioner rose to his feet , and began to put away his equipent . " That 's all . He 's dead . " Reith stared from the practitioner to Helsse and back . " BeCause of the questioning ? " " The smoke permeates the head . Sometimes the subjects live : often , in fact . This one died swiftly ; your questions ruptured his ensorium . " The following evening was clear and windy with puffs of dust racing over the vacant dancing field . Through the dusk men in gray cloaks came to the rented cottage . Within , lamps were low and windows shrouded ; conversations were conducted in quiet voices . Zarfo spread an old map out on the table , and pointed with a thick black finger . " We can travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niss country . We can fare east around the Sharf to Lake Falas : a long route . Or we can move south , through the Lost Counties , over the Infnets and down to Ao Hidis : the direct and logical route . " Reith asked , " Sky-rafts are n't available ? " Belje , the least enthusiastic of the adventurers , shook his head . " Conditions are no longer as they were when I was a youth . Then you might have selected among half a dozen . Now there are none . Sequins and sky-rafts are both hard to come by . So now , in pursuit of the one , we lack the use of the other . " " How will we travel ? " " To Blalag we ride by power wagon , where perhaps we can hire some sort of conveyance as far as the Infnets . Thereafter , we must go afoot ; the old roads south have been destroyed and for-gotten. "  | 14 FROM SMARGASH TO the old Lokhar capital , Blalag , was a threeday journey across a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dingy inn , where they were able to arrange transportation by motor-cart to the mountain-settlement Derduk , fa r into the Infnets . The journey occupied the better part of two days under uncomfortable conditions . At Derduk the only accommodation was a ramshackle cabin which provoked grumbling among the Lokhars . But the owner , a garrulous old man , stewed a great cauldron of game and wild berries , and the peevishness subsided . At Derduk the road south became a disused track . At dawn the now somewhat cheerless group of adventurers set forth on foot . All day they traveled through a land of rock pinnacles , fields of rubble and scree . At sundown with a chill wind sighing through the rocks they came upon a small black tarn where they passed the night . The next day brought them to the brink of a vast chasm and another day was spent finding a route to the bottom . On the sandy floor beside the river Desidea , on its way east to Lake Falas , the group camped , to be disturbed for much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echoing and reechoing through the rocks . In the morning , rather than attempt the south face of the precipice , they followed the Desidea and presently found a cleft which brought them out upon a high savannah rolling off into the murk . Two days the adventurers marched south , reaching the extreme ramparts of the Infnets by twilight of the second day , with a tremendous vista across the lands to the south . When night came a sparkle of far lights appeared . " Ao Hidis ! " cried the Lokhars in mingled relief and apprehension . Over the minuscule campfire that night there was much talk of Wankh and Wankhmen . The Lokhars were unanimous in their detestation of the Wankhmen : " Even the Dirdirmen , for all their erudition and preening , are never so jealous of their preroga-tives , " declared Jag Jaganig . Anacho gave an airy laugh . " From the Dirdirman point of view Wankhmen are scarcely superior to any of the other sub-races. " p 267 " Give the rascals credit , " said Zarfo , " they understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , in twenty-five years , I learned only pidgin chords for ' yes , " no , ' ' stop , " go , " right , " wrong , " good , " bad . ' I must admit to their achievement . " " Bah , " muttered Zorofim . " They are born to it ; they hear chimes from the first instant of their lives ; it is no great achieve-ment . " " One that they make the most of , however , " said Belje with something like envy in his voice . " Think ; they work at nothing , they have no responsibilities , but to stand between the Wankh and the world of Tschai , and they live in refinement and ease . " Reith spoke in a puzzled voice . " A man like Helsse now : he was a Wankhman who lived as a spy . What did he hope to achieve ? What Wankh interests did he safeguard in Cath ? " " Wankh interests  --  none . But remember , the Wankhmen are opposed to change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disadvantage . When a Lokhar begins to understand chimes he is sent away . In Cath  --  who knows what they fear ? " And Zarfo warmed his hands at the campfire . The night passed slowly . At dawn Reith looked toward Ao Hidis through his scanscope , but could see little for the mist . Surly with tension and lack of sleep the group once more set off to the south , keeping to such cover as offered itself . The city slowly became distinct ; Reith located the dock where the Vargaz had discharged  --  how long ago it seemed ! He traced the road which led through the market and north past the spacefield . From the heights the city seemed placid , lifeless ; the black towers of the Wankhmen brooded over the water . On the spacefield , plain to be seen , were five spaceships . By noon the party reached the ridge above the city . With great care Reith studied the spacefield , now directly below , through his scanscope . To the left were the repair shops , and nearby a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaffolds raised beside exposed machinery . Another ship , this the closest , at the back of the field , seemed to be an abandoned hulk . The condition of the other three vessels was not obvious , but the Lokhars declared them all operable . " It is a matter of routine , " said Zorofim . " When a ship is down for overhaul , it is moved close to the shops . The ships in transit dock yonder , in the ' Load Zone . ' "  | " It would seem then that three ships are potentially suitable for our purposes ? " The Lokhars would not go quite so far . " Sometimes minor repairs are done in the ' Load Zone , ' " said Belje . " Notice , " said Thadzei , " the repair cart by the access ramp . It carries components , cases , and they must come from one of the three ships in the ' Load Zone . ' " These were two small cargo ships and a passenger vessel . The Lokhars favored the cargo ships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger vessel , which Reith considered the most suitable , the Lokhars were in disagreement , Zorofim and Thadzei declaring it to be a standard ship in a specialized hull ; Jag Jaganig and Belje equally certain that this was either a new design or an elaborate modification , in either case certain to present difficul-ties . All day the group studied the spacefield , watching the activity of the workshop and the traffic along the road . During the middle afternoon a black air-car drifted down to land beside the passenger vessel , which now obscured the view , but it appeared that there was a transfer between ship and air-car . Somewhat later Lokhar mechanics brought a case of energy tubes to the ship , which according to Zarfo was a sure signal that the ship was preparing for departure . The sun sank toward the ocean . The men fell silent , studying the ships which , hardly more than a quarter-mile distant , seemed tantalizingly accessible . Still the question lingered : Which of the three ships in the " Load Zone " offered the maximum opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cargo ships , only Jag Jaganig preferring the passenger ship . Reith 's nerves began to crawl . The next few hours would shape his future , and far too many variables lay beyond his control . Strange that the ships should be guarded so lightly ! On the other hand who was apt to attempt the theft of a spaceship ? Probably not in the last thousand years had such an act occurred , if ever . Dusk fell over the landscape ; the group began to descend the mountainside . Floodlights illuminated the ground beside the warehouses , the repair shop , the depot in back of the loading zone . The remainder of the field remained in greater or less darkness , the ships casting long shadows away from the lights .  | The men scrambled the last few feet down to the base of the hill , crossed a path of dank marshland , and came to the edge of the field , and here they waited five minutes , watching and listening . The warehouses showed no activity ; in the shops a few men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reconnoiter . Crouching they ran to the abandoned hulk , where they stood in the shadows . From the machine shop came the whine of machinery ; from the depot a voice called something unintelligible . The three waited ten minutes . In the town at the back of the spacefield long skeins of light had come into being ; across the harbor the Wankh towers showed a few glimmers of yellow . The machine shop became quiet ; the workers appeared to be leaving . Reith , Zarfo and Thadzei moved across the field keeping to the long shadows . They reached the first of the small cargo ships , where again they halted to look and listen : there were no sounds , no alarms . Zarfo and Thadzei went to the entry hatch , heaved it open and entered , while Reith with beating heart stood guard outside . Ten interminable minutes passed . From within came furtive sounds and once or twice a glimmer of light , which aroused in Reith an intense nervousness . Finally the two Lokhars returned . " No good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's try the other . " They stole quickly across the bands of light and shadow to the second cargo ship ; as before Zarfo and Thadzei entered while Reith stood at the port . The Lokhars returned almost immediately . " Under repair , " Zarfo reported glumly . " This is where the component cases come from . " They turned to look at the passenger vessel . " It 's not a standard design , " Zarfo grumbled . " Still , the instruments and layout may be familiar to us . " " Let 's go aboard and look , " said Reith . But now a light flared across the field . Reith 's first thought was that they had been discovered . But the light played toward the passenger vessel . From the direction of the gate came a low easy-moving shape . The vehicle stopped beside the passenger vessel ; a number of dark figures alighted  --  how many could not be ascertained in the glare . With a curiously abrupt and heavy motion , the figures entered the ship . 270 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard . " " It would mean that the ship is ready for departure , " said Reith . " A chance we ca n't afford to miss ! " Zarfo demurred . " It 's one thing to steal an empty ship , another coping with a half dozen Wankh , and Wankhmen as well . " " How do you know Wankhmen are aboard ? " " Because of the lights . Wankh project pulses of radiation and observe the reflections . " Behind them came a faint sound . Reith whirled to find Traz . " We became worried ; you were gone so long . " " Go back ; bring everyone here . If we have opportunity , we 'll board the passenger ship . It 's the only one available . " Traz vanished into the darkness . Five minutes later the entire group stood in the shadow of the cargo ship . Half an hour went by . In the passenger ship shapes moved across the lights , performing activities beyond the comprehension of the nervous men . In husky whispers they debated possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship now ? Almost certainly departure was in the offing . Such action was obviously reckless . The group decided to pursue a conservative course and return into the mountains to await a more propitious occasion . As they started back , a number of Wankh issued from the vessel and lurched to the vehicle , which almost immediately left the field . Within the ship lights still glowed . No further activity was evident . " I 'm going to give it a look , " said Reith . He ran across the field , followed by the others . They mounted the ramp , passed through an embarkation port into the ship 's main saloon , which was unoccupied . " Everybody to his station , " said Reith . " Let 's take it up ! " " If we can , " grumbled Zorofim . Traz cried out a warning : turning , Reith saw that a single Wankh had entered the saloon , watching in nonplussed disapproval . It was a black creature somewhat larger than a man , with a heavy torso , a squat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The legs were short ; the feet were played webs ; it carried no weapons or implements ; in fact wore no garment or harness of any sort . From a sound organ at the base of the skull came four reverberating chimes , which , considering the circumstances , seemed measured and unexcited . Reith stepped forward , pointed to a settee , to indicate that it should sit down . The p 271 Wankh stood motionless , looking after the Lokhars who had gone their various ways , checking engines , energy , supplies , oxygen . The Wankh at last seemed to understand the events which were taking place . It took a step toward the exit port , but Reith barred the way and once again pointed to the settee . The Wankh loomed in front of him , the glassy eyes flickering . Once again the chimes sounded , more peremptory than before . Zarfo returned to the saloon . " The ship is in order . But it 's an unfamiliar model , as I feared . " " Can we take it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what we are doing . It may be minutes or hours . " " Then we ca n't let the Wankh go . " " Awkward , " said Zarfo . The Wankh thrust forward ; Reith pushed it back and displayed his handgun . The Wankh uttered a loud chime . Zarfo made a chirping sound . The Wankh drew back . Reith asked : " What did you say ? " " I just gave the pidgin sound for ' danger . ' It seems to understand well enough . " " I wish it would sit down ; it makes me nervous standing there . " " Wankh almost never sit , " said Zarfo and went to seal the entrance port . Time passed . From various locations about the ship came calls and exclamations from the Lokhars . At Reith 's direction , Traz stood in the observation dome , watching over the field . The Wankh stood stolidly , apparently at a loss for action . The ship shuddered ; the lights flickered , went dim , came on bright once more . Zarfo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines pumping . Now if Thadzei can figure out the control con-figurations ? " Traz called down : " The car is coming back . The floodlight has just gone on , to light the field . " Thadzei ran through the saloon , jumped up to the control console . He peered this way and that , while Zarfo stood by his side urging him to haste . Reith set Anacho to guarding the Wankh , joined Traz in the observation dome . The car was slowing to a stop beside the ship . Zarfo pointed here and there across the control panel ; Thadzei nodded doubtfully , thrust at a set of pressure pads . The ship  | shuddered and heaved ; Reith felt acceleration underfoot . He was departing Tschai ! Thadzei made adjustments ; the ship pitched . Reith reached for a stanchion ; the Wankh stumbled and fell upon the settee , where it remained . From elsewhere about the ship came full-throated Lokhar curses . Reith made his way to the bridge , to stand beside Thadzei , who desperately worked the controls , testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is there an automatic pilot ? " " Bound to be , somewhere . I ca n't locate the engagement . These are by no means standard controls . " " Do you know what you are doing ? " " No . " Reith looked down at the dark face of Tschai . " So long as we are going up and not down , we 're in good shape . " " If I had an hour , a single hour , " moaned Thadzei , " I could trace out the circuits . " Jag Jaganig came into the saloon to make a querulous protest . Thadzei called back : " I 'm doing the best I can ! " " It 's not good enough ! We 'll crash ! " " Not yet , " said Thadzei grimly . " I see a lever I have n't tried . " He pulled the lever ; the ship skidded alarmingly and thrust off at great speed to the east . Once more the Lokhars gave a series of anguished cries . Thadzei moved the lever back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling stasis . Thadzei gave a great tremulous sigh , peering back and forth across the panel . " Like none I have ever seen ! " Reith looked out the port but saw nothing but darkness . Zarfo spoke in a calm voice : " Our altitude is not quite a thousand feet . . . Now it is nine hundred ... " Thadzei desperately worked the controls . Once again the ship lurched and fled eastward . " Up , up ! " screamed Zarfo . " We 're diving into the ground ! " Thadzei brought the ship back to a halt . " Well then , this toggle will surely activate the repulsors . " He gave it a twitch . From aft came a sinister crackle , a muffled explosion . The Lokhars yelled mournfully . Zarfo read the altimeter . " Five hundred . . . Four hundred . . . Three . . . Two . . . One ... " Contact : a splash , a bobbing and pitching , then silence . The ship was afloat , apparently undamaged , in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Reith threw up his hands in fatalistic despair . Back once more in Tschai.  | Reith jumped down to the saloon . The Wankh stood like a statue . Whatever its emotions , none were evident . Reith went aft to the engine room , where Jag Jaganig and Belje looked disconsolately at a smoldering panel . " An overload , " said Belje . " Circuits and nodes are certainly melted . " " Can we make repairs ? " Belje made a glum sound . " If tools and parts are aboard . " " If time is given to us , " said Jag Jaganig . Reith returned to the saloon . He threw himself down upon a settee and stared bleakly at the Wankh . The plan had succeeded . . . almost . He leaned back , sodden with fatigue . The others must be feeling the same . No useful purpose could be served by going longer without rest . He got to his feet , called the group together . Two-man watches were set ; the others slumped upon settees to sleep as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the sky , followed by Braz . Dawn revealed a placid expanse which Zarfo identified as Lake Falas . " And never has it served a more useful purpose ! " Reith went out on the top surface of the hull , and searched the horizons through his scanscope . Hazy water stretched to south , east and west . To the north was a low shore toward which the ship was drifting , propelled by a gentle breeze from the south . Reith went back into the ship . The Lokhars had detached a panel and were unenthusiastically discussing the damage . Their attitudes gave Reith all the information he needed . In the saloon he found Anacho and Traz gnawing on spheres of black paste encased in a hard white rind which they had taken from a locker . Reith offered one of the spheres to the Wankh , who paid no heed . Reith ate the sphere himself , finding it similar to cheese . Zarfo presently joined him and verified what Reith already had guessed . " Repairs are not feasible . A whole bank of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Reith gave a gloomy nod . " As I expected . " " What next ? " demanded Zarfo . " As soon as the wind blows us ashore we disembark and return to Ao Hidis for another try . " Zargo grunted . " What of the Wankh ? " " We 'll have to let him go his own way . I certainly do n't plan to murder him . " " A mistake , " sniffed Anacho . " Best kill the repulsive beast . "  | " For your information , " said Zarfo , " the main Wankh citadel Ao Khaha is situated on Lake Falas . It will not be far distant . " Reith went back out on the foredeck . The first tussocks of the shore were only half a mile distant ; beyond lay quagmire . To ground at the edge of such a morass would be highly inconvenient , and Reith was glad to see that the wind , shifting to the east , seemed to be moving the ship slowly to the west , perhaps aided by a sluggish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to distinguish a set of irregular juts and promontories far to the west . From within came the sound of expostulation , followed by the thud of heavy footsteps . Out on the foredeck came the Wankh , followed by Anacho and Traz . The Wankh fixed Reith for half a second with its flicking vision , long enough to register an image , then turned by slow degrees to look around the horizon . Before Reith could prevent it  --  even were he able to do so ? the Wankh stepped forward , ran with its peculiar lurching gait down the side of the ship and plunged into the water . Reith caught a glimpse of wet black hide , then the creature was gone into the depths . Reith searched the surface for a period but saw no more of the Wankh . An hour later , checking the progress of the vessel , he once more turned the scanscope on the western shore . To his cold dismay he saw that the shapes he had thought to be crags were the black glass towers of an extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north with a new interest born of desperation . Tussocks of white grass protruded like hairy wens from fields of black slime and stagnant ponds . Reith went below to seek material for a raft , but found nothing . The padding of the settee was welded to the structure and came away in shreds and chunks . There was no lifeboat aboard . Reith returned to the deck and wondered what his next move should be . The Lokhars joined him : disconsolate figures in wheat-colored smocks , wind blowing the white hair back from their craggy black faces . Reith spoke to Zarfo : " Do you know the place yonder ? " " It must be Ao Khaha . " " If we are taken , what can we expect ? " " Death . " p 275 The morning passed ; the sun climbing toward noon dissolved the haze which shrouded the horizons , and the towers of Ao Khaha stood distinct . The ship was noted . On the water under the city appeared a barge , which surged across the water leaving a ribbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wankhmen stood the deck , perhaps a dozen , curiously alike ; slender men with ath-pale skins , saturnine or , in some instances , ascetic features . ith considered resistance : perhaps a desperate attempt to seize e barge ? He decided against such a trial , which almost certainly uld not succeed . The Wankhmen scrambled aboard the ship . Ignoring Reith , az and Anacho , they addressed the Lokhars . " All down to the rge . Do you carry weapons ? " " No , " grunted Zarfo . " Quick then . " Now they noticed Anacho . " What is this ? A rdirman ? " And they gave chuckles of soft surprise . They inted Reith . " And what sort is that one ? A motley crew , to be e ! Now then , all down to the barge ! " The Lokhars went first , hulk-shouldered , knowing what lay ad . Reith , Traz and Anacho followed . " All ! Stand on the deck , at the gunwales , in a neat line . Turn r backs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Lokhars started to obey . Reith had not expected such ca-1 and perfunctory slaughter . Furious that he had not resisted m the first he cried out : " Should we let them kill us so easily ? ' s make a fight of it ! " The Wankhmen gave sharp orders : " Unless you wish worse , ck ! To the gunwales ! " Near the barge the water roiled . A black shape floated lazily the surface and produced four plangent chimes . The Wankhstiffened ; their faces sagged into sneers of annoyance . They aved at their captives . " Back then , into the cockpit . " The barge returned to the great black fortress , the Wankhmen uttering among themselves . It passed behind a breakwater , gnetically clamped itself to a pier . The prisoners were marled ashore and through a portal , into Ao Khaha.  | 15 SURFACES OF BLACK glass , stark walls and areas of black concrete , angles , blocks , masses : a negation of organic shape . Reith wondered at the architecture ; it seemed remarkably abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides with dark concrete , the captives were taken . " Halt ! Remain in place ! " came the com-mand . The prisoners , with no choice , halted and stood in a surly line . " Water yourselves at that spigot . Perform evacuation into that trough . Make no noise or disturbance . " The Wankhmen departed , leaving the prisoners unguarded . Reith said in a wondering voice , " We have n't even been searched ! I still have my weapons . " " It 's not far to the portal , " said Traz . " Why should we wait here to be killed ? " " We 'd never reach the portal , " growled Zarfo . " So we must stand here like docile animals ? " " That 's what I plan to do , " said Belje , with a bitter glance toward Reith . " I 'll never see Smargash more , but I may escape with my life . " Zorofim gave a rude laugh . " In the mines ? " " I know only rumor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never emerges . There are ambushes and terrible tricks by Pnume and Pnumekin . If we are not executed out of hand we will go to the mines . " " All for avarice and mad folly ! " lamented Belje . " Adam Reith , you have much to answer for ! " " Quiet , poltroon , " said Zarfo without heat . " No one forced you to come . The fault is your own . We should abase ourselves before Reith ; he trusted our knowledge ; we showed him inepti-tude . " " All of us did our best , " said Reith . " The operation was risky ; we failed ; it 's as simple as that . . . As for trying to escape from here  --  I ca n't believe that they 'd leave us alone , unguarded , free to walk away . " Jag Jaganig snorted sadly . " Do n't be too sure ; to the Wankhmen we are animals . " Reith turned to Traz , whose perceptions at times bewildered him . " Could you find your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . Not directly . There were many turns . The buildings confuse me . " " Then we had best remain here . . . There 's a bare chance that we can talk our way out of the situation . " The afternoon passed , then the long night , with Az and Braz creating fantasies of shapes and shadows . In the chill morning , cantankerous with stiff joints and hunger , and increasingly restless because of their captors ' inattention , even the most fearful of the Lokhars were peering out of the cul-de-sac and speculating as to the whereabouts of the portal through the black glass wall . Reith still counseled patience . " We 'd never make it . Our only hope as I see it is that the Wankh may decide to be lenient with us . " Why should they be lenient ? " sneered Thadzei . " Their justice is forthright : the same justice we use toward pests . " Jag Jaganig was no less pessimistic . " We will never see the Wankh . Why else do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tschai ? " " We shall see , " said Reith . The morning passed . The Lokhars slumped torpidly against a wall . Traz , as usual , maintained his equanimity . Contemplating the boy , Reith could not help but wonder as to the source of his fortitude . Innate character ? Fatalism ? Did the personality of Onmale , the emblem he had worn so long , still shape his soul ? But other problems were more immediate . " This delay ca n't be accidental , " Reith fretted to Anacho . " There must be a reason . Are they trying to demoralize us ? " Anacho , as peevish as any of the others , said , " There are better ways than this . " " Are they waiting for something to happen ? What ? " Anacho could supply no answers . Late in the afternoon three Wankhmen appeared . One of these , wearing thin silver greaves and a silver medallion on a chain around his neck , appeared to be a person of importance . He surveyed the group with eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naughty children . " Well then , " he said briskly , " which among you is the leader of this group ? " Reith came forward with as much dignity as he could summon . " I am . " " You ? Not one of the Lokhars ? What did you hope to achieve ? "  | " May I ask who adjudicates our offense ? " Reith asked . The Wankhman was taken aback . " ' Adjudication ' ? What needs to be adjudicated ? The only point at issue , and a minor one , is your motive . " " I ca n't agree with you , " said Reith in a reasonable voice . " Our transgression was a simple theft ; only by sheer accident did we take aloft a Wankh . " " A Wankh ! Do you realize his identity ? No , of course not . He is a savant of the highest level , an Original Master . " " And he wants to know why we took his spaceship ? " " What then ? It is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on through me ; that is my function . " " I 'll be glad to do so , in his presence , and , I hope , in surroundings more appropriate than a back alley . " " Zff , but you are a cool one . Do you answer to the name of Adam Reith ? " " I am Adam Reith . " " And you recently visited Settra in Cath , where you associated with the so-called ' Yearning Refluxives ' ? " " Your information is at fault . " " Be that as it may , we want your reason for stealing a space-ship . " " Be on hand when I communicate with the Original Master . The matter is complex and I am certain he will have questions which can not be answered casually . " The Wankhman swung away in disgust . Zarfo muttered , " You are a cool one indeed ! But what do you gain by talking to the Wankh ? " " I do n't know . It 's worth trying . I suspect that the Wankhmen report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's understood by everyone but the Wankh . " " How can it be ? Are they innocent ? Or remote ? " " Neither . They have no other sources of information . The Wankhmen make sure the situation remains that way . The Wankh have small interest in the affairs of Tschai ; they 're only here to counter the Dirdir threat . " " Bah , " said Anacho . " The ' Dirdir threat ' is a myth ; the Expansionists are gone thousands of years . " " Then why are they still feared by the Wankh ? " demanded Zarfo . " Mutual distrust ; what else ? " p 279 " Natural antipathy . The Dirdir are an insufferable race . " Anacho walked away in a huff . Zarfo laughed . Reith shook his head in mild disapproval . Zarfo now said , " Take my advice , Adam Reith : do n't antagonize the Wankhmen , because you ca n't win but through them . Ingratiate , truckle , fawn  --  and at least they 'll bear you no mal-ice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Reith , " if it would do any good  --  which it wo n't . Our only hope is to push ahead . . . . And I 've come up with an idea or two which may help our case , if we get a chance to talk with the Wankh . " " You wo n't defeat the Wankhmen that way , " gloomed Zarfo . " They 'll tell the Wankh only as much as they see fit , and you 'll never know the difference . " " What I 'd like to do , " said Reith , " is work up to a situation where only the truth makes sense and where every other statement is an obvious falsity . " Zarfo shook his head in puzzlement and walked to the spigot to drink . Reith remembered that none of the group had eaten for almost two days ; small wonder they were listless and irritable . Three Wankhmen appeared . The official who previously had spoken to Reith was not among them . " Come along . Look sharp , now ; form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Reith asked , but received no reply . The group walked five minutes , through odd-angled streets and irregular courts , by acute and obtuse angles , past unexpected juts and occasional clear vistas , through deep shadow and the wan shine of Carina 4269 . They entered the ground floor of a tower , entered an elevator which took them up a hundred feet and opened upon a large octagonal hall . The chamber was dim ; a great lenticular bulge in the roof held water ; windblown ripples modulated light from the sky and sent it dancing around the hall . Tremors of sound were barely audible , sighing chords , complex dissonances ; sound both more and less than music . The walls were stained and discolored , a fact which Reith found peculiar , until looking closer he recognized Wankh ideograms , immense and intricately detailed , one to each wall . Each ideogram , thought Reith , represented a chime ; each chime was the sonic equivalent of a visual image . Here , reflected Keith , were highly abstract pictures . The chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the almost unheard chords drifted in and out of consciousness , and amber sunlight , refracted and broken into shimmers , swam through the room . Reith heard Traz gasp in surprise : a rare event . He turned . Traz pointed . " Look yonder ! " Standing in an alcove was Helsse , head bent in an attitude of brooding reverie . His guise was new and strange . He wore black Wankhman garments ; his hair was close-cropped ; he looked a person worlds apart from the suave young man Reith had encountered in Blue Jade Palace . Reith looked at Zarfo . " You told me he was dead ! " " So he seemed to me ! We put him out in the corpse shed , and in the morning he was gone . We thought the night-hounds had come for him . " Reith called : " Helsse ! Over here ! It 's Adam Reith . " Helsse turned his head , looked at him and Reith wondered how he ever could have taken Helsse for anything but a Wankhman . Helsse came slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So here : the sorry outcome to your exploits . " " The situation is discouraging , " Reith agreed . " Can you help us ? " Helsse raised his eyebrows . " Why should I ? I find you personally offensive , without humility or ease . You have subjected me to a hundred indignities ; your pro-'cult ' bias is repulsive ; the theft of a space vessel with an Original aboard makes your request absurd . " Reith considered him a moment . " May I ask why you are here ? " " Certainly . To supply information in regard to you and your activities . " Reith mulled the matter over . " Are we so important ? " " So it would seem , " said Helsse indifferently . Four Wankh entered the chamber , and stood by the far wall : four massive black shadows . Helsse stood straighter ; the other Wankhmen became silent . It was apparent , thought Reith , that whatever the total attitude of the Wankhmen toward the Wankh might be , that attitude included a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ranged in a line before the Wankh . A minute passed , during which nothing happened . Then the Wankh exchanged chimes : soft muffled sounds at half-second intervals , apparently unintelligible to the Wankh- p 281 men . Another silence ensued , then the Wankh addressed the Wankhmen , producing triads of three quick notes , like xylophone trills , in what seemed to be a simplified or elemental usage . The oldest Wankhman stepped forward , listened , turned to the prisoners . " Which of you is the pirate-master ? " " None of us , " said Reith . " We are not pirates . " One of the Wankh uttered interrogatory chimes . Reith thought he recognized the Original Master . The Wankhman , somewhat grudgingly , brought forth a small keyed instrument which he manipulated with astonishing deftness . " Tell him further , " said Reith , " that we regret the inconvenience we caused him . Circumstances compelled us to take him aloft . " " You are not here to argue , " said the Wankhman , " but to render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Again the Master uttered chimes and was answered . Reith asked : " What is he saying , and what did you tell him ? " The senior Wankhman said , " Speak only when you are directly addressed . " Helsse came forward , and producing his own instrument , played chimes at length . Reith began to feel uneasy and frustrated . Events were ranging far beyond his control . " What is Helsse saying ? " " Silence . " " At least inform the Wankh that we have a case which we want to present . " " You will be notified if it becomes necessary for you to testify . The hearing is almost at an end . " " But we have n't had a chance to speak ! " " Silence ! Your persistence is offensive ! " Reith turned to Zarfo . " Tell the Wankh something ! Any-thing ! " Zarfo blew out his cheeks . Pointing at the Wankhmen he made chirping sounds . The senior Wankhman said sternly : " Quiet , you are interrupting . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , ' Wrong , wrong , wrong . ' That 's all I know . " The Master spoke chimes , indicating Reith and Zarfo . The Senior Wankhman , visibly exasperated , said : " The Wankh want  | to know where you planned to commit your piracies , or , rather , where you planned to take the spaceship . " " You are not translating correctly , " protested Reith . " Did you tell him that we are not pirates ? " Zarfo again made sounds for " Wrong , wrong , wrong ! " The Wankhman said , " You are obviously pirates , or luna-tics . " Turning back to the Wankh , he played his instrument , misrepresenting , so Reith was sure , what had been said . Reith turned to Helsse . " What is he telling them ? That we are not pirates ? " Helsse ignored him . Zarfo guffawed , to everyone 's astonishment . He muttered in Reith 's ear : " Remember the Dugbo ? Pinch Helsse 's nose . " Reith said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reith stepped forward , tweaked his nose . Helsse seemed to become rigid . " Tell the Wankh that I am a man of Earth , the world of human origin , " said Reith , " that I took the spaceship only in order to return home . " Helsse woodenly played a set of trills and runs . The other Wankhmen became instantly agitated  --  sufficient proof that Helsse had translated accurately . They began to protest , to press forward , to drown out Helsse 's chimes , only to be brought up short by a great belling sound from the Master . Helsse continued , and at last came to an end . " Tell them further , " said Reith , " that the Wankhmen falsified my remarks , that they consistently do so to further their private purposes . " Helsse played . The other Wankhmen again started a great protest , and again were rebuked . Reith warmed to his task . He voiced one of his surmises , striking boldly into the unknown : " Tell them that the Wankhmen destroyed my spaceship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mission was innocent , that we came investigating radio signals broadcast a hundred and fifty Tschai-years ago . At this time the Wankhmen destroyed the cities Settra and Ballisidre from which the signals emanated , with great loss of life , and all for the same reason : to prevent a new situation which might disturb the Wankh-Dirdir stalemate . " The instant uproar among the Wankhmen convinced Reith that his accusations had struck home . Again they were silenced.  | Helsse played the instrument with the air of a man astounded by his own actions . " Tell them , " said Reith , " that the Wankhmen have systematically distorted truth . They undoubtedly have prolonged the Dirdir war . Remember , if the war ended , the Wankh would return to their home world , and the Wankhmen would be thrown upon their own resources . " Helsse , gray-faced , struggled to drop the instrument , but his fingers refused to do his bidding . He played . The other Wankhmen stood in dead silence . This was the most telling accusation of all . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end ! Prisoners , form your line ! March ! " Reith told Helsse : " Request that the Wankh order all the other Wankhmen to depart , so that we may communicate without in-terruption . " Helsse 's face twitched ; sweat poured down his face . " Translate my message , " said Reith . Helsse obeyed . Silence held the chamber , with the Wankhmen gazing in apprehension toward the Wankh . The Master uttered two chimes . The Wankhmen muttered among themselves . They came to a terrible decision . Out came their weapons ; they turned them , not upon the prisoners , but upon the four Wankh . Reith and Traz sprang forward , followed by the Lokhars . The weapons were wrested away . The Master uttered two quiet chimes . Helsse listened , then slowly turned to Reith . " He commands that you give me the weapon you hold . " Reith relinquished the gun . Helsse turned toward the other three Wankhmen , pushed the trigger-button . The three fell dead , their heads shattered . The Wankh stood a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall . The erstwhile prisoners remained with Helsse and the corpses . Reith took the gun from Helsse 's cold fingers , before he thought to use it again . The chamber began to grow murky with the coming of dusk . Reith studied Helsse , wondering how long the hypnotic state would persist . He said , " Take us outside the walls . " " Come . " Through the black and gray city Helsse took the group , finally  | to a small steel door . Helsse touched a latch ; the door swung aside . Beyond , a spine of rock led through the dusk to the main-land . The group filed through the gap into the open air . Reith turned to Helsse . " Ten minutes after I touch your shoulder , resume your normal condition . You will remember nothing of what has happened during the last hour . Do you understand ? " " Yes . " Reith touched Helsse 's shoulder ; the group hurried away through the twilight . Before a jut of rock hid them from sight Reith looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking somewhat wistfully after them . 16 IN A PATCH of rough forestland the group slumped down in total fatigue , their stomachs crawling with hunger . By the light of the two moons Traz searched through the undergrowth and found a clump of pilgrim plant , and the group made their first meal in two days . Somewhat refreshed , they moved on through the night , up a long slope . At the top of the ridge , they turned to look back , toward the gloomy silhouette of Ao Khaha on the moonlit sky . For a few minutes they stood , each man thinking his own thoughts , then they continued north . In the morning over a breakfast of toasted fungus , Reith opened his pouch . " The expedition has been a failure . As I promised , each man receives another five thousand sequins . Take them now , with my gratitude for your loyalty . " Zarfo took the purple-glowing pellets gingerly , weighed them in his fingers . " Above all I am an honest man , and since this was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jag Jaganig said : " Let me ask you a question , Adam Reith . You told the Wankh that you were a man from a far world , the home of man . Is this correct ? " " It is what I told the Wankh . " " You are such a man , from such a planet ? " " Yes . Even though Anacho the Dirdirman makes a wry face . " " Tell us something of this planet . " p 285 Reith spoke for an hour , while his comrades sat staring into the fire . Anacho at last cleared his throat . " I do not doubt your sincerity . But , as you say , the history of Earth is short compared to the history of Tschai . It is obvious that far in the past the Dirdir visited Earth and left a colony from which all Earthmen are de-scended . " " I could prove otherwise , " said Reith , " if our venture had been successful and we had all journeyed to Earth . " Anacho poked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dirdir f course would not sell or transfer a spaceship . Such a theft as we perpetrated upon the Wankh would be impossible . Still  --  at the Great Sivishe Spaceyards almost any component can be acquired , by purchase or discreet arrangement . One only needs se-quins  --  a considerable sum , true . " " How much ? " asked Reith . " A hundred thousand sequins would work wonders . " " No doubt . At the moment I have barely the hundredth part of that . " Zarfo threw over his five thousand sequins . " Here . It pains me like the loss of a leg . But let these be the first coins in the pot . " Reith returned the money . " At the moment they would only make a forlorn rattling sound . " Thirteen days later the group came down out of the Ifnets to Blalag , where they boarded a power wagon and so returned to Smargash . For three days Reith , Anacho and Traz ate , slept and watched the young folk at their dancing . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taproom . " All look sleek and lazy . Have you heard the news ? " " What news ? " " First , I have acquired a delightful property on a bend of the Whisfer River , with five fine keels , three psillas and an asponistra , not to mention the tayberries . Here I shall end my days  --  unless you tempt me forth on another mad venture . Secondly , two technicians this morning returned to Smargash from Ao Hidis . Vast changes are in the wind ! The Wankhmen are departing the fortresses ; they have been driven out and now live in huts with the Blacks and Purples . It appears that the Wankh will no longer tolerate their presence . "  | Reith chuckled . " At Dadiche we found an alien race exploiting men . At Ao Hidis we found men exploiting an alien race . Both conditions are now changed . Anacho , would you care to be liberated from your enervating philosophy and become a sane man ? " " I want demonstration , not words . Take me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " At the Great Sivishe Spaceyards are a dozen spaceboats , needing only procurement and assembly . " " Yes , but where are the sequins ? " " I do n't know , " said Anacho . " Nor I , " said Traz.  | THE SUN CARINA 4269 had passed into the constellation Tartusz , to mark the onset of Balul Zac Ag , the " unnatural dream time , " when slaughter , slave-taking , pillage and arson came to a halt across the Lokhar Highlands . Balul Zac Ag was the occasion for the Great Fair at Smargash , or perhaps the Great Fair had come first , eventually to generate Balul Zac Ag after unknown hundreds of years . From across the Lokhar Highlands and the regions surrounding Xar , Zhurveg , Seraf , Niss and others came to Smargash to mingle and trade , to resolve stale feuds , to gather intelligence . Hatred hung in the air like a stench ; covert glances and whispered curses , in-drawn hisses of detestation accented the color and confusion of the bazaar . Only the Lokhars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and black-haired ) maintained faces of placid unconcern . On the second day of Balul Zac Ag , as Adam Reith wandered through the bazaar , he became aware that he was being watched . The knowledge came as a dismal shock ; on Tschai , surveillance always led to a grim conclusion . Perhaps he was mistaken , Reith told himself . He had dozens of enemies ; to many others he represented ideological disaster ; but how could any of these have traced him to Smargash ? Reith continued along the crowded lanes of the bazaar , pausing at the booths to look back the way he had come . But his follower , if in fact he existed , was lost in the confusion . There were Niss in black robes , seven feet tall , striding like rapacious birds : Xars ; Serafs ; Dugbo nomads squatting over their fires ; Human Things expressionless behind pottery face-plates ; Zhurvegs in coffee-brown caftans ; the black and white Lokhars of Smargash themselves . There was odd staccato noise : the clank of iron , squeak of leather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jangle of Dugbo music . There were odors : fern-spice , gland-oil , submusk , dust rising and settling , the reek of pickled nuts , smoke from grilled  | meats , the perfume of the Serafs . There were colors : black , d brown , orange , old scarlet , dark blue , dark gold . Leaving the b zaar Reith crossed the dancing field . He stopped short , and fro the corner of his eye glimpsed a figure sliding behind a tent . Thoughtfully Reith returned to the inn . Traz and the Dirdi man , Ankhe at afram Anacho , sat in the refectory making a me of bread and meat . They ate in silence ; disparate beings , ea found the other incomprehensible . Anacho , tall , thin and pa Ili like all Dirdirmen , was completely hairless , a quality he no tended to minimize under a soft tasseled cap after the style of t Yao . His personality was unpredictable ; he inclined toward ga rulity , freakish jokes , sudden petulances . Traz , square , som and sturdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consi ered Anacho vain , over-subtle , over-civilized ; Anacho thoug Traz tactless , severe and over-literal . How the two managed travel in comparative amity was a mystery to Reith . Reith seated himself at the table . " I think I 'm being watched , ' he announced . Anacho leaned back in dismay . " Then we must prepare f disaster  --  or flight . " " I prefer flight , " said Reith . He poured himself ale from stone jug . " You still intend to travel space to this mythical planet o yours ? " Anacho spoke in the voice of one who reasons with a obstinate child . " I want to return to Earth , certainly . " " Bah , " muttered Anacho . " You are the victim of a hoax , of an obsession . Can you not cure yourself ? The project is easier to discuss than to effectuate . Spaceships are not wart-scissors , to be picked up at any bazaar booth . " Reith said sadly , " I know this only too well . " Anacho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you apply at the Grand Sivishe Spaceyards . Almost anything can be procured , if one has enough sequins . " " I suspect that I do n't , " said Reith . " Go to the Carabas . Sequins can be had by the bucketful . " Traz gave a short snort of derision . " Do you take us for ma-niacs ? " " Where is the Carabas ? " asked Reith . " The Carabas is in the Dirdir Hunting Preserve , at the north  | of Kislovan . Men with luck and strong nerves sometimes pros-per . " Fools , gamblers and murderers , rather , " muttered Traz . Reith asked , " How do these men , whatever their nature , gain the sequins ? " Anacho 's voice was flippant and airy . " By the usual method : they dig up nodes of chrysospine . " Reith rubbed his chin . " Is this the source of sequins ? I thought that the Dirdir or some such folk minted them . " " Your ignorance is that of another planet indeed ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rueful twitch . " It could hardly be otherwise . " " The chrysospine , " said Anacho , " grows only in the Black Zone , which is to say , the Carabas , where uranium compounds occur in the soil . A full node yields two hundred and eighty-two sequins , of one or another color . A purple sequin is worth a hundred clears ; a scarlet is fifty , and down through the emeralds , blues , sards and milks . Even Traz knows as much . " Traz looked at Anacho with a curled lip . " ' Even Traz ' ? " Anacho paid him no heed . " All this to the side ; we have no certain evidence of surveillance . Adam Reith may well be mis-taken . " " Adam Reith is not mistaken , " said Traz . " ' Even Traz , ' as you put it , knows better than this . " Anacho raised his hairless eyebrows . " How so ? " " Notice the man who just entered the room . " " A Lokhar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lokhar . He watches our every move . " Anacho 's jaw fell a trifle slack . Reith studied the man surreptitiously ; he seemed less burly , less direct and abrupt than the typical Lokhar . Anacho spoke in a subdued voice : " The lad is right . Notice how he drinks his ale , head down instead of back ... Disturbing . " Reith muttered , " Who would be interested in us ? " Anacho gave a bark of caustic laughter . " Do you think that our exploits have gone unnoticed ? The events at Ao Hidis have aroused attention everywhere . " " So this man  --  whom would he serve ? "  | Anacho shrugged . " With his skin dyed black I ca n't even guess his breed . " " We 'd better get some information , " said Reith . He considered a moment . " I 'll walk out through the bazaar , then around into the Old Town . If the man yonder follows , give him a start and come behind . If he stays , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reith went out into the bazaar . At a Zhurveg pavilion he paused to examine a display of rugs , woven , according to rumor , by legless children , kidnapped and maimed by the Zhurvegs themselves . He glanced back the way he had come . No one appeared to be following . He went on a little way , and paused by the racks where hideous Niss women sold coils of braided leather rope , leap-horse harness , crudely beautiful silver goblets . Still no one behind . He crossed the passage to examine a Dugbo display of musical instruments . If he could take a cargo of Zhurveg rugs , Niss silver , Dugbo musical instruments back to Earth , thought Reith , his fortune would be made . He looked over his shoulder , and now he observed Anacho dawdling fifty yards behind . Anacho clearly had learned nothing . Reith sauntered on . He paused to watch a Dugbo necromancer : a twisted old man squatting behind trays of misshapen bottles , jugs of salve , junction-stones to facilitate telepathy , love-sticks , sheafs of curses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen fantastic kites , which the old Dugbo manipulated to produce a wan wailing music . He proffered Reith an amulet , which Reith refused to buy . The necromancer spat epithets and caused his kites to dart and shriek discords . Reith moved on , into the Dugbo encampment proper . Girls wearing scarves and flounced skirts of black , old rose and ocher solicited Zhurvegs , Lokhars , Serafs , but taunted the prudish Niss who stalked silently past , heads out-thrust , noses like scythes of polished bone . Beyond the encampment lay the open plain and the far hills , black and gold in the light of Carina 4269 . A Dugbo girl approached Reith , jangling the silver ornaments at her waist , smiling a gap-toothed grin . " What do you seek out here , my friend ? Are you weary ? This is my tent ; enter , refresh yourself . " Reith declined the invitation and stepped back before her fingers or those of her younger sister could flutter near his pouch . " Why are you reluctant ? " sang the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful ? I have polished my limbs with Seraf wax ; I am scented with haze-water ; you could do far worse ! " " No doubt whatever , " said Reith . " Still ... " " We will talk together , Adam Reith . We will tell each other of many strange matters . " " How do you know my name ? " demanded Reith . The girl waved her scarf at the younger girls , as if at insects . " Who at Smargash does not know Adam Reith , who strides abroad like an Ilanth prince , and his mind always full of thoughts ? " " I am notorious then ? " " Oh , indeed . Must you go ? " " Yes . I have an engagement . " Reith continued on his way . The girl watched after him with an odd half-smile , which Reith , looking over his shoulder , found disconcerting . A few hundred yards further along , Anacho approached from a side-lane . " The man dyed like a Lokhar remained at the inn . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Dugbo . In the encampment she accosted you , then followed no more . " " Strange , " muttered Reith . He looked up and down the street . " No one follows us now ? " " No one is visible . We might well be under observation . Turn about , if you will . " Anacho ran his long white fingers over the fabric of Reith 's jacket . " So I suspected . " He displayed a small black button . " And now we know who tracks you . Do you recognize this ? " " No . But I can guess . A tell-tale . " " A Dirdir adjunct for hunting , used by the very young or the very old to guide them after their quarry . " " So the Dirdir are interested in me . " Anacho 's face became long and pinched , as if he tasted something acrid . " The events at Ao Khaha have naturally attracted their attention . " " What should they want with me ? " " Dirdir motives are seldom subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill you . " " The time has come to move on . " Anacho glanced toward the sky . " That time has come and gone . I suspect that a Dirdir sky-car approaches at this very moment . . . Give me the button . "  | A Niss approached , black robes flapping to the stride of his legs . Anacho stepped forth , made a swift movement toward the black gown . The Niss sprang around with a grunt of menace , and for a moment seemed ready to abandon the unnatural restraints of Balul Zac Ag . Then he wheeled and continued along his way . Anacho gave his thin fluting chuckle . " The Dirdir will be puzzled when Adam Reith proves to be a Niss . " " Before they learn differently , we had best be gone . " " Agreed , but how ? " " I suggest that we consult old Zarfo Detwiler . " " Luckily we know where to find him . " Skirting the bazaar , the two approached the ale-house , a ramshackle structure of stone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dust and confusion of the bazaar . A stone crock of ale almost hid his black-dyed face . He was dressed in unaccustomed elegance : polished black boots , a maroon cape , a black tricorn hat pulled down over his flowing white hair . He was somewhat drunk and even more garrulous than usual . With difficulty Reith made him aware of his problem . Zarfo at last became exercised . " So , the Dirdir now ! Infamous , and during Balul Zac Ag ! They had better control their arrogance , or know the wrath of the Lokhars ! " " All this to the side , " said Reith , " how can we most quickly leave Smargash ? " Zarfo blinked and dipped another ladle of ale from the crock . " First I must learn where you wish to go . " " The Isles of Cloud , or perhaps the Carabas . " Zarfo let the ladle sag in shock . " The Lokhars are the most avaricious of people , yet how many attempt the Carabas ? Few ! And how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house to the east , with the chain of carved ivory around the bower ? " " I have seen the manor . " " There are no other such manors near Smargash , " said Zarfo portentously . " Do you get my meaning ? " He rapped on the bench . " Pot-boy ! More ale . " " I mentioned the Isles of Cloud as well , " said Reith . " Tusa Tala on the Draschade is more convenient for the Isles . How to reach Tusa Tala ? The motor-wagon fares only to Siadz at the edge of the highlands ; I know of no route down the chasms to  | the Draschade . The caravan to Zara is two months gone . A skyraft is the only sensible conveyance . " " Well , then , where can we obtain a sky-raft ? " " Not from the Lokhars ; we have none . Look yonder : a skyraft and a party of rich Xars ! They are about to depart . Maybe their destination is Tusa Tala . Let us inquire . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Reith called the potboy , sent him running to the inn . Zarfo strode out across the compound with Reith and Anacho behind . Five Xars stood by their old sky-raft : short bullshouldered men with congested complexions . They wore rich robes of gray and green ; their black hair rose in rigid varnished columns , flaring slightly outward and sheared off flat . " Leaving Smargash so soon , friend Xars ? " Zarfo called out in a cheerful voice . The Xars muttered together and turned away . Zarfo ignored the lack of affability . " Where then are you bound ? " " Lake Falas ; where else ? " declared the oldest Xar . " Our business is done ; as usual we were cheated . We are anxious to return to the swamps . " " Excellent . This gentleman and his two friends need transportation to a point in your general direction . They asked me whether they should offer to pay ; I said , ' Nonsense ! The Xars are princes of generosity ? ' " " Hold ! " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks to make . First , our raft is crowded . Second , we are generous unless we lose sequins in the process . Third , these two nondescripts have a reckless and desperate air about them , not at all reassuring . Is this the third ? " The reference was to Traz , who had arrived on the scene . " A mere lad but no less dubious for all that . " Another Xar spoke . " Two further questions : How much can they pay ? Where do they wish to go ? " Reith , considering the uncomfortably scant supply of sequins in his pouch , said , " A hundred sequins is all we can offer ; and we want to be taken to Tusa Tala . " The Xars threw up their hands in outrage . " Tusa Tala ? A thousand miles northwest ! We head southeast to Lake Falas ! A hundred sequins ? Is this a joke ? Mountebanks ! Off with all of you ! " Zarfo swaggered threateningly forward . " A mountebank ,  | you call me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drea time , ' I would tweak all of your ludicrously long noses ! " The Xars made spitting sounds between their teeth , climb aboard the raft and departed . Zarfo stared after the departing raft . He heaved a sigh . " In this case , failure . . . Well , all may not prove so churlish . In the sky comes another craft ; we shall put the proposal to those aboard , or at an extremity , render them drunk and borrow the vehicle . A handsome craft , that . Surely ? " Anacho gave a startled outcry . " A Dirdir sky-car ! Already they are here ! Away to concealment , for our very lives ! " He started to dart away . Reith seized his arm . " Do n't run ; do you want them to identify us so quickly ? " To Zarfo : " Where shall we hide ? " " In the ale-house storeroom  --  but never forget that this is Balul Zac Ag ! The Dirdir would never dare violence ! " " Bah , " sneered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or care ? " " I will explain to them , " declared Zarfo . He led the three to a shed beside the ale-house , ushered them within . Through a crac in the plank Reith watched the Dirdir sky-car settle into the corn pound . On sudden thought he turned to Traz , felt over his ga ments , and in vast dismay discovered a black disc . " Quick , " said Anacho . " Give it here . " He left the shed , we into the ale-house . A minute later he returned . " An old Lokh departing for his cottage now carries the tell-tale . " He went to a crack , peered out toward the field . " Dirdir , sure enough ! As always when sport is to be had ! " The sky-car lay quiet : a craft different from any Reith had seen heretofore , the product of a sure and sophisticated technology . Five Dirdir stepped to the ground : impressive creatures , harsh , mercurial , decisive . They stood approximately at human height , and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their dermal surfaces suggested polished bone ; their crania raised into sharp blade-like crests , with incandescent antennae streaming back at either side . The contours of the faces were oddly human , with deep eye-sockets , the scalp crests descending to suggest nasal ridges . They half-hopped , half-loped , like leopards walking erect ; it was not hard to see in them the wild creatures which had hunted the hot plains of Sibol . Three persons approached the Dirdir : the false Lokhar , the  | gbo girl , a man in nondescript gray garments . The Dirdir ke with the three for several minutes , then brought forth inments , which they pointed in different directions . Anacho d : " They locate their tell-tales . And the old Lokhar in the alese still.dawdles over his pot ! " " No matter , " said Reith . " As well in the ale-house as anyere else . " The Dirdir approached the ale-house , moving with their curi-half-loping stride . Behind came the three spies . The old Lokhar chose this moment to lurch from the aleuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great leaps . The Lokhar drew back in alarm . " What have we re ? Dirdir ? Do n't interfere with me ! " The Dirdir spoke in sibilant lisping voices which suggested absence of a larynx . " Do you know a man called Adam ith ? " " Indeed not ! Stand aside ! " Zarfo thrust himself forward . " Adam Reith , you say ? What of ? " " Where is he ? " " Why do you ask ? " The false Lokhar stepped forward , muttered to the Dirdir. e Dirdir said . " You know Adam Reith well ? " " Not well . If you have money for him , leave it with me ; he ould have wanted it so . " " Where is he ? " Zarfo looked out across the sky . " You saw the sky-raft which eparted as you arrived ? " " Yes . " " It might be that he and his friends were aboard . " " Who claims this to be true ? " " Not I , " said Zarfo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor I , " said the old Lokhar who had carried the telltale . " What is the direction ? " " Pah ! You are the great trackers , " sneered Zarfo . " Why ask us poor innocents ? " The Dirdir retreated across the compound in long strides . The sky-car darted off into the air . Zarfo confronted the three Dirdir agents , his big face twisted Into a malevolent grin . " So here you are in Smargash , violating our laws . Do you not know this is Balul Zac Ag ? "  | " We committed no violence , " stated the false Lokhar , " but merely did our work . " " Dirty work , conducive to violence ! You shall all be flogged . Where are the constables ? I give these three into custody ! " The three agents were hustled away , protesting and crying and making demands . Zarfo came to the shed . " Best that you leave at once . The Dirdir will not delay long . " He pointed across the compound . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where does it take us ? " " Out to the highland rim . Beyond lie the chasms ! A grim territory . But if you remain here , you will be taken by the Dirdir . Balti I Zac Ag or no . " Reith looked around the compound , at the dusty stone and timber structures of Smargash , at the black and white Lokhars , a t the shabby old inn . Here had been the single interim of peace and security he had known on Tschai ; now events were forcing him once more into the unknown . In a hollow voice he said , " We need fifteen minutes to collect our gear . " Anacho said in a dismal voice , " The situation does not accord with my hopes . . . But I must make the best of it . Tschai is a world of anguish . " ZARFO CAME TO the inn with white Seraf robes and spine helmets . " Wear these ; conceivably you may win an additional hour or two . Hurry  --  the wagon is at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reith surveyed the compound . " There may be other spies , watching our every move . " " Well , then , by the back lane . After all , we can not anticipate every contingency . " Reith made no further comments ; Zarfo was becoming peevish and anxious to get them out of Smargash , no matter in what direction . Silently , each man thinking his own thoughts , they went to the motor-wagon terminus . Zarfo told them : " Say nothing to anyone ; pretend to meditate : that is the way of the Serafs . At sundown face the east and utter a loud cry : ' Ah-oo-cha ! ' No one  | knows what it means but that is the Seraf way . If pressed , state that you come to buy essences . So then : aboard the wagon ! May you avoid the Dirdir and succeed in all your future undertakings . And if not , remember that death comes only once ! " " Thank you for the consolation , " said Reith . The motor-wagon trundled off on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plain toward the west . Reith , Anacho and Traz sat alone in the aft passenger cubicle . Anacho was pessimistic in regard to their chances . " The Dirdir will not be confused for long . The difficulties will only make them keen . Do you know that the Dirdir young are like beasts ? They must be tamed , then trained and educated . The Dirdir spirit remains feral ; hunting is a lust . " " Self-preservation is no less a lust with me , " Reith stated . The sun sank behind the rim ; gray-brown dust settled over the landscape . The wagon paused at a dismal little village ; the passengers stretched their legs , drank brackish water raised from a well , haggled for buns with a withered old crone who asked outrageous prices and laughed wildly at counter-proposals . The wagon proceeded , leaving the old woman muttering beside her tray of buns . 1 The dusk faded through umber into darkness . From across the wasteland came a weird hooting : the call of night-hounds . In the east rose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahead loomed a jut of rock : an ancient volcanic neck , so Reith surmised . From the summit glowed three wan yellow lights . looking up through his scanscope* Reith saw the ruins of a castle ... He dozed for an hour and awoke to find the wagon rolling through soft sand beside a river . On the opposite bank psillas stood outlined against the moonlit sky . Presently they passed a many-cupolaed manor-house , apparently uninhabited and in the process of decay . Half an hour later , at midnight , the wagon rumbled into the compound of a large village , to halt for the night . The passengers composed themselves to sleep on their benches or on top of the wagon . Carina 4269 finally rose : a cool amber disc only gradually dispelling the morning mist . Vendors brought trays of pickled p 300 meats , pastes , strips of boiled bark , toasted pilgrim pod , from which the passengers made a breakfast . The wagon proceeded to the west toward the Rim Mountains , now jutting high into the sky . Reith occasionally swept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Too early yet , " said Anacho cheerlessly . " Never fear ; it will come . " At noon the wagon reached Siadz , the terminus : a dozen stone huts surrounding a cistern . To Reith 's intense disgust , no transportation , neither motorwagon nor leap-horse , could be hired for transportation onward across the rim . " Do you know what lies beyond ? " demanded the elder of the village . " The chasms . " " Is there no trail , no trade-route ? " " Who would enter the chasms , for trade or otherwise ? What sort of folk are you ? " " Serafs , " said Anacho . " We explore for asofa root . " " Ah , the Serafs and their perfumes . I have heard tales . Well , do n't play your immortal antics on us ; we are a simple people . In any event , there is no asofa among the chasms ; only cripthorn , spumet and rack-belly . " " Nevertheless , we will go forth to search . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road somewhere to the north , but I know of none who have seen it . " " What people inhabit the chasms ? Are they friendly ? " " ' People ' ? A joke . A few pysantillas , red cors under every rock , bode-birds . If you are extremely unlucky you might meet a fere . " " It seems a dire region . " " Aye , a thousand miles of cataclysm . Still , who knows ? Where cowards never venture , heroes find splendor . So it may be with your perfume . Strike out to the north and seek the ancient road to the coast . It will be no more than a mark , a crumble . When darkness comes , make yourself secure : night-hounds range the wastes ! " Reith said , " You have dissuaded us ; we will return east with the motor-wagon . " " Wise , wise ! Why , after all , throw away your lives , Seraf or no ? " Reith and his companions rode the motor-wagon a mile back  | down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon lumbered east and presently disappeared into the amber murk . There was silence about them . They stood on coarse gray soil , with here and there wisps of salmon-colored thorn and at even greater intervals a coarse tangle of pilgrim plant , which Reith saw with a certain glum satisfaction . " So long as we find pilgrim plant we wo n't starve . " Traz gave a dubious grunt . " We had best reach the mountains before dark . On the flat night-hounds have advantage over three men . " " I know an even better reason for haste , " said Anacho . " The Dirdir wo n't be puzzled long . " Reith searched the empty sky , the bleak landscape . " They might conceivably become discouraged . " " Never ! When thwarted they grow excited , furious with zeal . " " We 're not far from the mountains . We can hide in the shadow of the boulders , or in one of the ravines . " An hour 's travel brought them under the crumbling basalt palisade . Traz suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but long since had learned to defer to Traz 's percep-tions . " Phung* droppings , " said Traz . " About two days old . " Reith nervously checked the availability of his handgun . Eight explosive pellets remained . When these were gone the gun became useless . It might be , thought Reith , that his luck was running out . He asked Traz , " Is it likely to be close at hand ? " Traz shrugged . " The Phung are mad things . For all I know , one stands behind that boulder . " Reith and Anacho looked uneasily about . Anacho finally said , " Our first concern must be the Dirdir . The critical period has begun . They will have traced us aboard the motor-wagon ; they can easily follow us to Siadz . Still , we are not completely without advantage , especially if they lack game-finding instruments . " " What instruments are these ? " asked Reith . " Detectors of human odor or heat radiation . Some trace footprints by residual warmth , others observe exhalations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five miles . " " Phung : solitary nocturnal creature indigenous to Tschai.  | " And when they catch their game ? " " The Dirdir are conservative . They do not recognize change , " said Anacho . " They need not hunt but are driven by inner forces . They consider themselves beasts of prey , and impose no restraint upon themselves . " " In other words , " said Traz , " they will eat us . " Reith was gloomily silent . At last he said , " Well , we must not be captured . " " As Zarfo the Lokhar said , ' Death comes but once . ' " Traz pointed . " Notice the break into the palisade . If ever a road existed , there it must go . " Across barren hummocks of compacted gray soil , around tangles of thorn and tumbled beds of rubble , the three hurried , perspiring and constantly watching the sky . At last they reached the shadow of the notch , but could find no trace of the road . If ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from view . Anacho suddenly gave a low sad call . " The sky-car . It comes . We are hunted . " Reith forced back a panicky urge to run . He looked up the notch . A small stream trickled down the center , to terminate in a stagnant tarn . To the right rose a steep slope ; to the left , a massive buttress overhung an area of deep shade , at the back of which was an even deeper shadow : the mouth of a cave . The three crouched behind the tumble which choked half the ravine . Out over the plain the Dirdir boat , with chilling deliberation , slid toward Siadz . Reith said in a neutral voice , " They ca n't detect our radiation through the rocks . Our carbon dioxide blows up the notch . " He turned to look up the valley . " No point in running , " said Anacho . " There 's no sanctuary . If they follow us this far they will chase us forever . " Five minutes later the sky-car returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altitude of two or three hundred yards . Suddenly it swerved and circled . Anacho said in a fateful voice , " They have found our tracks . " The sky-car came across the plain , directly toward the notch . Reith brought forth his handgun . " Eight pellets left . Enough to explode eight Dirdir . " " Not enough to explode one . They carry shields against such missiles . "  | In another half-minute the sky-car would be overhead . " Best that we take to the cave , " said Traz . " Obviously the haunt of Phung , " muttered Anacho . " Or an adit of the Pnume . Let us die cleanly , in the open air . " " We can walk through the pond , " said Traz , " and stand below the overhang . Our trail is then broken ; they may follow the stream up the valley . " " If we stand here , " said Reith , " we 're finished for sure . " The three ran through the shallow fringes of the pond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loom of the cliff . The odor of Phung was strong and rich . Over the shoulder of the mountain opposite came the skyboat . " They 'll see us ! " said Anacho in a hollow voice . " We 're in plain sight ! " " Into the cave , " hissed Reith . " Back , further back ! " " The Phung ? " " There may be no Phung . The Dirdir are certain ! " Reith groped back into the dark , followed by Traz and finally Anacho . The shadow of the sky-car passed over the pond , flitted on up the valley . Reith flashed his light here and there . They stood in a large chamber of irregular shape , the far end obscured in murk . Light brown nodules and flakes covered the floor ankle-deep ; the walls were crusted over with horny hemispheres , each the size of a man 's fist . " Night-hound larvae , " muttered Traz . Anacho stole to the cave-mouth , looked cautiously forth . He jerked back . " They 've missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light and looked cautiously from the cave-mouth . A hundred yards away the sky-car descended to the ground , silent as a falling leaf . Five Dirdir alighted . For a moment they stood in consultation ; then , each carrying a long transparent shield , they advanced into the notch . As if at a signal , two leaped forward like silver leopards , peering along the ground . Two others came behind at a slow lope , weapons ready ; the fifth remained to the rear . The pair in the lead stopped short , communicating in odd squeaks and grunts . " The hunting language , " Anacho muttered , " from the time they were yet beasts . " " They look no different now . " The Dirdir halted at the far shore of the pond . They looked ,  | listened , smelled the air , obviously aware their prey was close at hand . Reith sighted along his handgun , but the Dirdir continually twitched their shields , frustrating his aim . One of the leading Dirdir searched the valley through binoculars ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At once he found something of interest . A great bound took him to the spot where Reith , Traz and Anacho had halted before crossing to the cave . Sighting through the black instrument , the Dirdir followed the tracks to the pond , then searched the space below the overhang . He gave a series of grunts and squeaks ; the shields jerked about . Anacho muttered , " They see the cave . They know we 're here . " Reith peered into the back reaches of the cave . Traz said in a matter-of-fact voice , " There is a Phung back there . Or it has not long departed . " " How do you know ? " " I smell it . I feel the pressure . " Reith turned to the Dirdir . Step by step they came , effulgences sparkling up from their heads . Reith spoke in a fateful croak : " Back , into the cave . Perhaps we can set up some kind of am-bush . " Anacho gave a stifled groan ; Traz said nothing . The three retreated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Traz touched Reith 's arm . He whispered , " Notice the light behind us . The Phung is close at hand . " Reith halted , to strain his eyes into the dark . He saw no light . Silence pressed upon them . Reith now thought to hear the faintest of scraping sounds . Cautiously he crept back through the dark , gun ready . And now he sensed yellow light : a wavering glimmer reflecting against the cave-wall . The scrape-scrape-scrape was somewhat louder . With the utmost caution Reith peered around a jut of rock , into a chamber . A Phung sat , back half-turned , burnishing its brachial plates with a file . An oil lamp emitted a yellow glow ; to the side a broad-brimmed black hat and a cloak hung from a peg . Four Dirdir stood in the mouth of the cave , shields in front , weapons ready ; their effulgences , standing high , furnished their only light . Traz plucked one of the horny hemispheres from the wall . He  | threw it at the Phung , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back behind the jut of rock . The Phung came forth ; they could see its shadow against the glimmer of lamp-light . It returned into its chamber , once more came forth , and now it wore its hat and cloak . For a moment it stood silent , not four feet from Reith , who thought the creature must surely hear the thud-thud-thud of his heart . The Dirdir came three bounds forward , effulgences casting a wan white glow around the chamber . The Phung stood like an eight-foot statue , shrouded in its cloak . It gave a cluck or two of chagrin , then a sudden series of whirling hops took it among the Dirdir . For a taut instant , Dirdir and Phung surveyed each other . The Phung swung out its arms , swept two Dirdir together , squeezing and crushing both . The remaining Dirdir , backing silently away , swung up their weapons . The Phung leaped on them , dashing the weapons aside . It tore the head from one ; the other fled , with the Dirdir who had stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phung danced a queer circular jig , sprang forth , leaped ahead of them , kicking water into a spray . It pushed one under the surface and stood on him , while the other ran up the valley . The Phung presently stalked in pursuit . Reith , Traz and Anacho darted from the cave and made for the sky-car . The surviving Dirdir saw them and gave a despairing scream . The Phung was momentarily distracted ; the Dirdir dodged behind a rock , then with desperate speed dashed past the Phung . He seized one of the weapons which had previously been knocked from his hand , and burned off one of the Phung 's legs . The Phung fell in a sprawling heap . Reith , Traz and Anacho were now scrambling into the skycar ; Anacho settled to the controls . The Dirdir screamed a wild admonition , and ran forward . The Phung made a prodigious hop , to alight on the Dirdir with a great flapping of the cloak . With the Dirdir at last a tangle of bones and skin , the Phung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a stork , ruefully considering its single leg .  | BELOW LAY THE chasms , separated by knife-edged ridges of ston Black gash paralleled black gash ; looking down Reith wonder whether he and his party could possibly have survived to reac the Draschade . Almost certainly not . He speculated : Did the chasms tolerate life of any sort ? The old man at Siadz had men tioned pysantillas and fere ; who knows what other creatures in. habited the gulches far below ? He now noticed , wedged in a crevice high between two peaks , a crumble of angular shapes like an efflorescence from the mother rock : a village , apparently of men , though none could be seen . Where did they find water ? In the depths of the chasm ? How did they provide themselves with food ? Why did they choose so remote an aerie for their home ? There were no answers to his questions ; the aerie was left behind in the murk . A voice broke into Reith 's musings : a sighing , rasping , sibilant voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the voice cut off . Anacho showed no concern ; Reith forbore to ask questions . The afternoon waned ; the chasms spread to become flat bottomed gorges full of darkness , while the intervening ridges showed fringes of dark gold . A region as grim and hopeless as the grave , thought Reith . He recalled the village , now far behind , and became melancholy . The peaks and ridges ended abruptly to form the front of a gigantic scarp ; the floors of the gorges extended and joined . Ahead lay the Draschade . Carina 4269 , sinking , laid a topaz trail across the leaden water . A promontory jutted into the sea , sheltering a dozen fishing craft , high at bow and stern . A village struggled along the foreshore , lights already glimmering into the dusk . Anacho circled slowly above the village . He pointed . " Notice the stone building with the two cupolas and the blue lamps ? A tavern , or perhaps an inn . I suggest that we put down to refresh ourselves . We have had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dirdir trace us ? " " Small risk . They have no means to do so . I long since isolated the identity crystal . And in any event , that is not their way . " Traz peered suspiciously down at the village . Born to the in-  | land steppes , he distrusted the sea and sea-people , considering both uncontrollable and enigmatic . " The villagers may well be stile , and set upon us . " " I think not , " said Anacho in the lofty voice which invariably ' tated Traz . " First , we are at the edge of the Wankh realm ; ese folk will be accustomed to strangers . Secondly , so large an implies hospitality . Thirdly , sooner or later we must descend order to eat and drink . Why not here ? The risk can be no eater than at any other inn upon the face of Tschai . Fourthly , e have no plans , no destination . I consider it foolish to fly aimlessly through the night . " Reith laughed . " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave his head a sour shake , but put forward no further objections . nacho landed the sky-car in a field beside the inn , close under a low of tall black chymax trees which tossed and sighed to a cold Wind off the sea . The three alighted warily , but their arrival had attracted no great attention . Two men , hunching along the lane with capes gripped close against the wind , paused a moment to survey the sky-car , then continued with only an idle mutter of comment . Reassured , the three proceeded to the front of the inn and pushed through a heavy timber door into a great hall . A halfdozen men with sparse sandy hair and pale bland faces stood by the fireplace nursing pewter mugs . They wore rough garments of gray and brown fustian , knee-high boots of well-oiled leather ; Keith took them for fishermen . Conversation halted . All turned narrow gazes toward the newcomers . After a moment they reverted to the fire , their mugs , their terse conversations . A strapping woman in a black gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Travelers . Can you give us meals and lodging for the night ? " " What 's your nature ? Are you fjord men ? Or Rab ? " " Neither . " " Travelers often be folk who do evil in their own lands and are sent away .

" The woman grunted once more and turned away , but serve additionally a salad of sweet lichen and a tray of condiments . The inn , so she informed them , had originally been the residence a the Foglar pirate kings . Treasure was reputedly buried below t dungeons . " But digging only uncovers bones and more bon some broken , some scorched . Stern men , the Foglars . Well , th do you wish tea ? " The three went to sit by the fire . Outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoke the blaze . " The chambe are down the hall .

" So long as the couches are clean we will be content . " " Strange travelers that come in so grand a sky-car . You " ? she pointed a finger toward Anacho ? " might well be a Dirdirman . Is that a Dirdir sky-car ? " " I might be a Dirdirman and it might be a Dirdir sky-car . And we might be engaged upon important work where absolute dish cretion is necessary . " " Aha , indeed ! " The woman 's jaw slacked . " Something to d with the Wankh , no doubt ! Do you know , there 's been grea changes to the south ? The Wankhmen and the Wankh are all odds ! " " We are so informed . " The woman leaned forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it is rumored . " " I think not , " said Anacho . " While the Dirdir inhabit Haul so long will the Wankh hold their Kislovan forts , and the BI Chasch keep their torpedo pits ready . " The woman cried , " And we , poor miserable humans : pa of the great folk , never knowing which way to jump ! I say Bev take ' em all , and welcome ! " She shook her fist to south , to southwest and northwest , the directions in which she located her principal antagonists ; theft she departed the chamber . Anacho , Traz and Reith sat in the ancient stone hall , watchin the fire flicker . " Well , then , " asked Anacho . " What of tomorrow ? " " My plans remain the same , " said Reith . " I intend to return  | Earth . Somewhere , somehow , I must gain possession of a spaceship . This program is meaningless for you two ; you should go where you feel secure : the Isles of Cloud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will go ; then perhaps you will allow me to continue in the sky-car . " Anacho 's long harlequin face assumed an expression almost im . " And where will you take yourself ? " " You mentioned the spaceyards at Sivishe ; this will be my tination . " " What of money ? You will need a great deal , as well as subtly and , most of all , luck . " " For money there is always the Carabas . " Anacho nodded . " Every desperado of Tschai will tell you the me . But wealth does not come without extreme risk . The Cara-s lies within the Dirdir Hunting Preserve ; trespassers are fair me . If you evade the Dirdir , there is Buszli the Bandit , the Blue nd , the vampire women , the gamblers , the hook-men . For every man who gains a handful of sequins , another three leave eir bones , or fill Dirdir guts . " Reith gave an uneasy grimace . " I 'll have to take my chances . " The three sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long o I wore Onmale and never am I entirely free of the weight . Sometimes I feel it calling from under the soil . In the beginning it ordained life for Adam Reith ; now , even if I wished , I would not desert Adam Reith for fear of Onmale . " " I am a fugitive , " said Anacho . " I have no life of my own . We have destroyed the first Initiative , * but sooner or later there will a second Initiative . The Dirdir are pertinacious . Do you know here we might find the most security ? At Sivishe , close under The Dirdir city Hei . As for the Carabas . . . " Anacho gave a doleful gh . " Adam Reith seems to have a knack for survival . I have thing better to do . I will take my chances . " " I 'll say no more , " said Reith . " I 'm grateful for your comapny . " For a space the three looked into the flames . Outside the wind histled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carabas , " id Reith . " Why should not the sky-car give us an advantage ? "  | Anacho fluttered his fingers . " Not in the Black Zone . The Di dir would take note and instantly be upon us . " " There must be tactics of some sort to lessen the danger , " said Reith . Anacho gave a grim chuckle . " Everyone who visits the Zo has his private theories . Some enter by night ; others wear camo flage and puff boots to muffle their tracks . Some organize bri gades and march as a unit ; others feel more secure alone . Some enter from Zimle ; others come down from Maust . The eventualities are usually the same . " Reith rubbed his chin reflectively . " Do Dirdirmen join the hunt ? " Anacho smiled into the flames . " The Immaculates have been known to hunt . But your concept has no value . Neither you not Traz nor I could successfully impersonate an Immaculate . " The fire became coals ; the three went to their tall dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea In the morning they ate a breakfast of salt biscuit and tea , then settled their tariff and departed the inn . The day was dreary . Cold tendrils of fog sifted through the chymax trees . The three boarded the sky-car . Up they rose through the overcast , and finally broke out into the wan ambelr sunlight . Westward they flew , over the Draschade Ocean . 4 THE GRAY DRASCHADE rolled below : the ocean which Reith  --  it seemed an eon ago  --  had crossed aboard the cog Vargaz . Anacho flew close above the surface , to minimize the risk of detection by Dirdir search-screens . " We have important decisions to make , " he announced . " The Dirdir are hunters ; we have become prey . In principle , a hunt once initiated must be consummated , but the Dirdir are not a cohesive folk like the Wankh ; their programs result from individual initiatives , the so-called zhna-dih . This means a great dashing leap , trailing lightning-like sparks . The zeal expended upon finding us depends upon whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky-car and is now dead . If so , there is a considerable diminution of risk , unless another Dirdir wishes to assert h'so  --  a word meaning  | ' marvelous dominance ' ? and organizes another tsau'gsh , whereupon conditions are as before . If the hunt-chief is alive , he becomes our mortal enemy . " Reith asked in wonder , " What was he before ? " Anacho ignored the remark . " The hunt-chief has the force of e community at his disposal , though he asserts his h'so more mphatically by zhna-dih . However , if he suspects that we fly the ky-car , he might well order up search-screens . " Anacho offandedly indicated a disk of gray glass to the side of the instrument panel . " If we touch a search-screen you 'll see a mesh of orange lines . " The hours went by . Anacho somewhat condescendingly ex- plained the operation of the sky-car ; both Traz and Reith familrized themselves with the controls . Carina 4269 swung across the sky , overtaking the sky-car and dropping into the west . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blurring and merging into the sky . Anacho began to talk of the Carabas : " Most sequin-takers enter at Maust , fifty miles south of the First Sea . At Maust are the most complete outfitters ' shops , the finest charts and handbooks , and other services . I consider it as good a destination as any . " " Where are the nodes usually found ? " " Anywhere within the Carabas . There is no rule , no system of discovery . Where many folk seek , nodes are naturally few . " " Then why not choose a less popular entry ? " " Maust is popular because it is most convenient . " Reith looked ahead toward the yet unseen coast of Kislovan and the unknown future . " What if we use none of these entries , but some point in between ? " " What is there to gain ? The Zone is the same from any direc-tion . " " There must be some way to minimize risks and maximize gains . " Anacho shook his head in disparagement . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude a form of arrogance ? " " No , " said Reith . " I do n't think so . " " How , " argued Anacho , " should you succeed with such facility where others have failed ? " Reith grinned . " It 's not arrogant to wonder why they failed . " " One of the Dirdir virtues is zs'hanh , " said Anacho . " It means ' contemptuous indifference to the activity of others . ' There are  | twenty-eight castes of Dirdir , which I will not enumerate , and four castes of Dirdirmen : the Immaculates , the Intensives , the Estranes , the Cluts . Zs'hanh is reckoned an attribute of the fourth through the thirteenth Dirdir grades . The Immaculates also practice zs'hanh . It is a noble doctrine . " Reith shook his head in wonder . " How have the Dirdir managed to create and coordinate a technical civilization ? In such a welter of conflicting wills ? " " You misunderstand , " said Anacho in his most nasal voice . " The situation is more complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the next highest group . He wins acceptance by his achievements , not by causing conflicts . Zs'hanh is not always appropriate to the lower castes , nor for the very highest , which use the doctrine of pn'hanh : ' corrosive or metal-bursting sagacity . ' " " I must belong in a high caste , " said Reith . " I intend to use pn'hanh rather than zs'hanh . I want to exploit every possible advantage and avoid every risk . " Reith , looking sidewise at the long sour face , chuckled to himself . He wants to point out that my caste is too low for such affectations , thought Reith , but he knows that I 'll laugh at him . The sun sank with unnatural deliberation , its rate of decline slowed by the westward progress of the sky-car . Toward the end of the afternoon a gray-violet bulk rose above the horizon , to meet the disc of the pale brown sun . This was the island , Leume , close under the continent of Kislovan . Anacho turned the sky-car somewhat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandy north cape . The three spent the night at the Glass Blower 's Inn , a structure contrived of bottles and jugs discarded by the shops at the sand-pits behind the town . The inn was dank and permeated with a peculiar acrid odor ; the evening meal of soup , served in heavy green glass tureens , evinced something of the same flavor . Reith remarked on the similarity to Anacho , who summoned the Gray* servant and put a haughty question . The servant indicated a large black insect darting across the floor . " The skarats do indeed be pungent creatures , and exhale a chife . Bevol made a plague on us , until we put p 313 them to use and found them nutritious . Now we hardly capture enough . " Reith long had been careful never to make inquiry regarding foods set before him , but now he looked askance into the tureen . " You mean . . . the soup ? " " Indeed , " declared the servant . " The soup , the bread , the pickles : all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of purpose , they 'd infest us to the same effect , so we make a virtue of convenience , and think to enjoy the taste . " Reith drew back from the soup . Traz ate stolidly . Anacho gave a petulant sniff and also ate . It occurred to Reith that never on Tschai had he noticed squeamishness . He heaved a deep sigh , and since no other food was forthcoming , swallowed the rancid soup . In the dim brown morning breakfast was again soup , with a garnish of sea vegetables . The three departed immediately after , flying northwest across Leume Gulf and the stony wastes of Kis-lovan . Anacho , usually nerveless , now became edgy , searching the ky , peering down at the ground , scrutinizing the knobs and bubbles , the patches of brown fur and vermilion velvet , the quivering mirrors which served as instruments . " We approach the Dirdir realm , " he said . " We will veer north to the First Sea , then bear West to Khorai , where we must leave the sky-car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . the Carabas . " OVER THE GREAT Stone Desert flew the sky-car , parallel to the black and red peaks of the Zopal Range , over parched dust-flats , fields of broken rock , dunes of dark pink sand , a single oasis surrounded by plumes of white smoke-tree . Late in the afternoon a windstorm drove lion-colored rolls of dust across the landscape , submerging Carina 4269 in murk . Anacho swung the sky-car north . Presently a black-blue line on the horizon indicated the First Sea . Anacho immediately landed the sky-car upon the barrens , some ten miles short of the sea .  | " Khorai is yet hours ahead ; best not to arrive after dark . 1 ' Khors are a suspicious folk , and flourish their knives at a har . word . At night they strike without provocation . " " These are the folk who will guard our sky-car ? " " What thief would be mad enough to trouble the Khors ? " Reith looked around the waste . " I prefer supper at the Gla Blower 's Inn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anacho . " In the Carabas you will recall the silen and peace of this night with longing . " The three bedded themselves down into the sand . The night was dark and brilliantly clear . Directly overhead burned the constellation Clari , within which , unseen to the eye , glimmered the Sun . Would he ever again see Earth ? Reith wondered . How often then would he lie under the night sky looking up into Argo Navin for the invisible brown sun Carina 4269 and its dim planet Tschai ? A flicker inside the sky-car attracted his attention : he went look and found a mesh of orange lines wavering across the rad screen . Five minutes later it disappeared , leaving Reith with a sense of chill and desolation . In the morning the sun rose at the edge of the flat plain in a sky uncharacteristically clear and transparent , so that each small irregularity , each pebble , left a long black shadow . Taking the sky-car into the air , Anacho flew low to the ground ; he too had noticed the orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidding : clumps of stunted smoke-tree appeared , and presently black dendron and bladder-bush . They reached the First Sea and swung west , following the shoreline . They passed over villages : huddles of dull brown brick with conical roofs of black iron , beside copses of enormous dyan trees , which Anacho declared to be sacred groves . Rickety piers like dead centipedes sprawled out into the dark water ; doubleended boats of black wood were drawn up the beach . Looking through the scanscope Reith noted men and women with mus-tard-yellow skins . They wore black gowns and tall black hats ; as the sky-car passed over they looked up without friendliness . " Khors , " stated Anacho . " Strange folk with secret ways . They are different by day and by night  --  at least this is the report . Each individual owns two souls which come and go with dawn and sunset , so that each is two different persons . Peculiar tales are  | " He pointed ahead . " Notice the shore , where it draws back a funnel . " Reith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nowiliar dyan copses and a huddle of dull brown huts with black roofs . From a small compound a road led south over the rollhills toward the Carabas . Anacho said , " Behold the sacred grove of the Khors , in which , it is said , souls are exchanged . Yonder you see the caravan terus and the road to Maust . I dare not take the sky-car further ; ce we must land and make our way to Maust as ordinary se -- takers , which is not necessarily a disadvantage . " " And when we return will the sky-car still be here ? " Anacho pointed down to the harbor . " Notice the boats at an-r . Looking through his scanscope Reith observed three or four zen boats of every description . " Those boats , " said Anacho , " brought sequin-takers to Khofrom Coad , Hedaijha , the Low Isles , from the Second Sea and Third Sea . If the owners return within a year , they sail from orai and to their homes . If within the year they do not return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt we arrange the same contract . " Reith made no arguments against the scheme , and Anacho opped the sky-car toward the beach . " Remember , " Anacho warned , " the Khors are a sensitive pie . Do not speak to them ; pay them no heed except from nesity , in which case you must use the fewest possible words . ey consider garrulity a crime against nature . Do not stand upend of a Khor , nor if possible downwind ; such acts are symbolic antagonism . Never acknowledge the presence of a woman ; do t look toward their children  --  they will suspect you of laying a rse ; and above all ignore the sacred grove . Their weapon is the n dart which they throw with astonishing accuracy ; they are a angerous people . " " I hope I remember everything , " said Reith . The sky-car landed upon the dry shingle ; seconds later a great gaunt brown-skinned man , with deep-sunk eyes , concave cheeks , a crag of a nose , came running forward , his coarse brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dreadful Cara-s ? " Reith gave a cautious assent : " This is our design . "  | " Sell me your sky-car ! Four times I have entered the Zone , creeping from rock to rock ; now I have my sequins . Sell me your sky-car , so that I may return to Holangar . " " Unfortunately we will need the sky-car upon our return , " said Reith . " I offer you sequins , purple sequins ! " " They mean nothing to us ; we go to find sequins of our own . " The gaunt man gave a gesture of emotion too wild to be expressed in words and lunged off down the beach . A pair of Khors now approached : men somewhat slender and delicate of physique , wearing black gowns and cylindrical black hats which gave the illusion of height . The mustard-yellow faces were grave and still , the noses thin and small , the ears fragile shells . Fine black hair grew up rather than down , to be contained within the tall hat . They seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  perhaps a distinct species . The older of the two spoke in a thin soft voice : " Why are you here ? " " We go to take sequins , " said Anacho . " We hope to leave the sky-car in your care . " " You must pay . The sky-car is a valuable device . " " So much the better for you should we fail to return . We can pay nothing . " " If you return , you must pay . " " No , no payment . Do not insist or we will fly directly to Maust . " The mustard-yellow faces showed no quiver of emotion . " Very well , but we allow you only to the month Temas . " " Only three months ? Too short a period ! Give us until the end of Meumas , or better Azaimas . " " Until Meumas . Your sky-car will be secure against all but those from whom you stole it . " " It will be totally secure ; we are not thieves . " " So be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the precise in-stant . " The three took their possessions and walked through Khorai , to the caravan terminus . Under an open shed a motor-wagon was being prepared for a journey , with a dozen men of as many races standing by . The three made arrangements for passage , and an hour later departed Khorai , along the road south to Maust. p 317 Over barren hills and dry swales rolled the motor-wagon , halting for the night at a hostel operated by an order of white-faced women . They were either members of an orgiastic religious sect or simple prostitutes ; long after Reith , Anacho and Traz had stretched out upon the benches which served as beds , drunken shouts and wild laughter came from the smoky common room . In the morning the common room was dim and quiet , reeking with spilled wine and the smoke of dead lamps . Men huddled face-down over tables , or sprawled along benches , their faces the color of ash . The women of the place entered , now harsh-voiced and peremptory , with cauldrons of thin yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from earthenware bowls and staggered out to the motor-wagon , which presently set forth to the south . By noon Maust appeared in the distance : a jumble of tall narrow buildings with high gables and crooked roof-lines , built of dark timber and age-blackened tile . Beyond , a barren plain extended to the dim Hills of Recall . Running boys came out to meet the motor-wagon . They shouted slogans and held up signs and banners : " Sequin-takers attention ! Kobo Hux will sell one of his excellent sequin-detectors . " " Formulate your plans at the Inn of Purple Lights . " " Weapons , puff-pads , maps , digging implements from Sag the Mercantilist are eminently useful . " " Do not grope at random ; the Seer Garzu divines the location of large purple nodes . " " Flee the Dirdir with all possible agility ; use supple boots provided by Awalko . " " Your last thoughts will be pleasant if , before death , you first consume the euphoric tablets formulated by Laus the Thaumaturge . " " Enjoy a jolly respite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The motor-wagon halted in a compound at the edge of Maust . The passengers alighted into a crowd of bawling men , urgent boys , grimacing girls , each with a new proffer . Reith , Traz and Anacho pushed through the throng , avoiding as best they could the hands which reached to grasp them and their possessions . They entered a narrow street running between tall , agedarkened structures , the beer-colored sunlight barely penetrating to the street . Certain of the houses sold gear and implements conceivably useful to the sequin-taker : grading kits , camouflage , spoor eliminators , tongs , forks , bars , monoculars , maps , guides , talismans and prayer powders . From other houses came the clash of cymbals , a raucous honking of oboes , accompanied by calls of  | drunken exaltation . Certain of the buildings catered to gamblers ; others functioned as inns , with restaurants occupying the ground floor . Everywhere lay the weight of antiquity , even to the dry aromatic odor of the air . Stones had been polished by the casual touch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old brown tiles showed a subtle luster to glancing light . At the back of the central plaza stood a spacious hostelry , which appeared to offer comfortable accommodation and which Anacho favored , though Traz grumbled at what he considered excessive and unnecessary luxury . " Must we pay the price of a leap-horse merely to sleep the night ? " he complained . " We have passed a dozen inns more to my taste . " " In due course you will learn to appreciate the civilized nice-ties , " said Anacho indulgently . " Come , let us see what is offered within . " Through a portal of carved wood they entered the foyer . Chandeliers fashioned to represent sequin-clusters hung from the ceiling ; a magnificent rug , black of field with a taupe border and five starbursts of scarlet and ocher , cushioned the tile floor . A majordomo approached to inquire their needs . Anacho spoke for three chambers , clean linen , baths and unguents . " And what do you demand in the way of tariff ? " " For such accommodation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied the majordomo . Traz gave an exclamation of shock ; even Anacho was moved to protest . " What ? " he exclaimed . " For three modest chambers , you demand three hundred sequins ? Have you no sense of proportion ? The charges are outrageous . " The majordomo gave his head a curt inclination . " Sir , this is the famous Alawan Inn , at the threshold of the Carabas . Our patrons never begrudge themselves ; they go forth either for wealth or the experience of a Dirdir intestine . What then a few sequins more or less ? If you are unable to pay our fees I suggest the Den of Restful Repose or the Black Zone Inn . Notice , however , that the tariff includes access to a buffet of good-quality victuals as well as a library of charts , guides and technical advice , not to mention the services of an expert consultant . " " All very well , " said Reith . " First we will look into the Black Zone Inn , and one or two other establishments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unit value sequin , the " clear . "  | The Black Zone Inn occupied the loft above a gambling establishment . The Den of Restful Repose was a cold barracks a hundred yards north of town , beside a refuse dump . After inspecting several other hospices the three returned to the Alawan , where by dint of furious haggling they managed to secure a somewhat lower rate , which they were forced to pay in advance . After a meal of stewed hackrod and mealcake , the three repaired to the library , at the back of the second floor . The side wall displayed a great map of the Zone ; shelves held pamphlets , portfolios , compilations . The consultant , a small sad-eyed man , sat to the side and responded to questions in a confidential whisper . The three passed the afternoon studying the physiography of the Zone , the tracks of successful and unsuccessful ventures , the statistical distribution of Dirdir kills . Of those who entered the Zone , something under two-thirds returned , with an average gain of sequins to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are somewhat misleading , " Anacho stated . " They include the fringe-runners who never venture more than half a mile into the Zone . The takers who work the hills and the far slopes account for most of the deaths and most of the wealth . " There were a thousand aspects to the science of sequin-taking , with arrays of statistics to illuminate every possible inquiry . Upon sighting a Dirdir band a sequin-taker might run , hide or fight with chances of clean escape calculated in terms of physiography , the time of day , proximity to the Portal of Gleams . Takers organized into bands for self-protection attracted an overcompensating number of Dirdir and their chances of survival decreased . Nodes were found in all parts of the Zone , most being found in the Hills of Recall and upon the South Stage , the savanna at the far side of the hills . The Carabas was reckoned no-man's-land , takers occasionally ambushing each other ; such acts were reckoned as eleven percent of the risk . Dusk approached , and the library became filled with gloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the light of three great chandeliers , servitors in black silk livery had already laid out the evening meal . Reith was moved to remark at so much elegance , to which Anacho gave a bark of sardonic amusement . " Flow else to justify such exorbitant tariffs ? " He went off to the buffet and returned with three cups of spiced wine . The three , leaning back in the ancient settees , observed the  | other sojourners , most of whom sat alone . A few were in pairs , and a single group of four huddled at a far table , in dark cloaks and hoods which revealed only long ivory noses . Anacho spoke : " Eighteen men in the room , with ourselves . Nine will find sequins , nine will find none . Two may locate a node of high value , purple or scarlet . Ten , perhaps twelve , will pass through Dirdir guts . Six , or perhaps eight , will return to Maust . Those ranging the farthest to find the choicest nodes run the most risk ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Traz said dourly , " Every day in the Zone a man faces one chance in four of death . His average gain is about four hundred sequins : it would seem that these men , and ourselves as well , value life at only sixteen hundred sequins . " " Somehow we 've got to change the odds , " said Reith . " Everyone who comes to the Zone makes similar plans , " said Anacho dryly . " Not all succeed . " " Then we must try something no one else has considered . " Anacho made a skeptical sound . The three went forth to explore the town . The music houses showed red and green lights ; on the balconies frozen-faced girls twitched and postured and sang strange soft songs . The gambling houses showed brighter lights and more fervent activity . Each seemed to specialize in a particular game , as simple as the throw of fourteen-faced dice , as complex as chess played against the house professionals . They stopped to watch a game call Locate the Prime Purple Node . A board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Forelands , the Hills of Recall , the South Stage , the gorges and valleys , the savannas , the streams and forests were faithfully depicted . Blue , red and purple lights indicated the location of nodes , sparse along the Forelands , more plentiful in the Hills of Recall and on the South Stage . Khusz , the Dirdir hunting camp , was a white block , with purple prongs rising from each corner . A numbered grid was superimposed upon all . A dozen players overlooked the board , each controlling a manikin . Also on the board were the effigies of four lunging Dirdir hunters . The players in turn cast fourteen-sided dice to determine the movement of all the manikins across the grid , as each player elected . The Dirdir hunters , moving to the same numbers , endeavored to cross an intersection on which rested a manikin , whereupon the manikin was declared destroyed and removed from the game .  | Each manikin sought to cross the lights representing sequin nodes , thus augmenting his score . Whenever he chose , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid his winnings . More often , prompted by greed , the player held his manikin on the board until a Dirdir struck it down , by which he lost the totality of his gain . Reith watched the game in fascination . The players sat clenching the rails of their booths . They stared and fidgeted , calling hoarse orders to the operators , yelling in exultation when they won a node , groaning at the approach of the Dirdir , leaning back with sick faces when their manikins were destroyed and their winnings lost . The game ended . No further manikins roamed the Carabas . No Dirdir hunted an empty Zone . The players stiffly descended from their booths ; those who had won free of the Zone took their winnings . The Dirdir returned to Khusz beyond the South Stage . New players bought manikins , climbed into the booths and the game began once more . Reith , Traz and Anacho continued along the street . Reith aused at a booth to scan packets of folded paper on display . lacards read : Meticulously annotated across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere 1000 sequins , guaranteed to be unexploited . and The chart of Goragonso the Mysterious , who lived in the Zone like a shadow , nurturing his secret nodes like children , at a mere 3500 sequins . Never exploited . Reith looked to Anacho for explanation . " Simple enough . Such folk as Sabour Yan and Goragonso the ysterious over the years explore the safer regions of the Cara- , seeking out low-grade nodes , the waters and milks , the pale which are known as sards , the pale greens . When they losuch nodes they carefully note their position and conceal stn as best they may , under heaps of gravel or slabs of shale , king to return in later years after the nodes mature . If they r d purple nodes so much the better , but in the near regions filch for safety 's sake they frequent , purple nodes are fete ,  | save those which as ' waters ' or ' milks ' or ' sards , ' were discovered and concealed a generation before . When such men are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying such a chart can be risky . The first person to come into possession of the chart might ' exploit ' it , removing the choicest nodes , and then putting the chart up for sale as ' unexploited . ' Who can prove otherwise ? " The three returned to the Alawan . In the foyer a single chandelier exuded the light of a hundred sullen jewels , which lost itself in the shadows , with only a colored gleam here and there on the dark wood . The refectory was also dim , occupied by a few murmuring groups . From an urn they drew bowls of pepper-tea and settled themselves in a booth . Traz spoke in a disgruntled voice : " This place is insane : Maust and the Carabas together . We should leave and seek wealth in some normal manner . " Anacho gave an airy wave of white fingers and spoke in a didactic and fluting voice : " Maust is merely an aspect of the interplay between men and money , and must be viewed on this basis . " " Must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To gain sequins either in Maust or in the Zone is a gamble , at poor odds . I do not care to gamble . " " As far as I am concerned , " said Reith , " I plan to gain sequins , but I do not intend to gamble. , ' , Impossible ! " Anacho declared . " In Maust you gamble with sequins ; in the Zone you gamble with your life . How can you avoid doing so ? " " I can try to reduce the odds to a tolerable level . " " Everyone hopes to do the same . But Dirdir fires burn nightly across the Carabas , and at Maust the shopkeepers earn more than most sequin-takers . " " Taking sequins is uncertain and slow , " said Reith . " I prefer sequins already gathered . " Anacho pursed his lips in quizzical calculation . " You plan to rob the sequin-gatherers ? The process is risky . " Reith looked up at the ceiling . How could Anacho still misread the processes of his mind ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am puzzled , " said Anacho . " Whom do you intend to rob ? " Reith spoke with care . " While we watched the hunting game ,  | I began to wonder : when Dirdir kill a taker , what happens to his sequins ? " Anacho gave his fingers a bored flutter . " The sequins are booty ; what else ? " " Consider a typical Dirdir hunt-party : long long will it remain in the Zone ? " " Three to six days . Grand hunts and commemoratives are longer ; competition hunts are somewhat less extended . " " And , in a day , how many kills will a typical party make ? " Anacho considered . " Each hunter naturally hopes for a trophy each day out . The usual well-seasoned party kills two or three times each day , sometimes more . They waste much meat , necessarily . " " So that the typical hunting party returns to Khusz with sequins from as many as twenty takers . " Anacho said curtly , " So it might be . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us say , five hundred . Hence each hunting party returns with a value of ten thousand sequins . " " Do n't allow the calculation to excite you , " Anacho remarked in the driest of voices . " The Dirdir are not a generous folk . " " The game-board , I take it , is an accurate representation of the Zone ? " Anacho gave a dour nod . " Reasonably so . Why do you ask ? " " Tomorrow I want to trace the hunt routes out from Khusz and back again . If the Dirdir come to the Carabas to hunt men , they can hardly protest if men hunt Dirdir . " " Who can imagine men hunting the Effulgents ? " croaked Anacho . " It 's never been done before ? " " Never ! Do gekkos hunt smur ? " " In this case we gain the benefit of surprise . " " No doubt of that ! " declared Anacho . " But you must proceed without me ; I will have none of it . " Traz choked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amuses you ? " " Your fear . " Anacho leaned back in his seat . " If you knew the Dirdir as I do , you would fear too . " " They are alive . Kill , they die . " " They are hard to kill . When they hunt , they use a separate  | region of their mind , what they call the ' Old State . ' No man can stand against them . Reith 's concept verges upon insanity . " " Tomorrow we 'll study the hunt-board again , " said Reith in a soothing voice . " Something may suggest itself . " THREE DAYS LATER , an hour before dawn , Reith , Traz and Anacho departed Maust . Passing through the Portal of Gleams , they set out across the Foreland toward the Hills of Recall , black on the mottled dark brown and violet sky , ten miles to the south . Ahead and behind , a dozen other shapes ran half-crouched through the cool gloom . Some had burdened themselves with equipment : digging implements , graders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no more than a sack , a knife , a wad of alimentary paste . Carina 4269 shouldered up through the murk , and some of the takers , crawling into patches of scrub , concealed themselves under camouflage cloth , to await the coming of dusk before proceeding further . Others plunged ahead , anxious to reach the Boulder Patch , accepting the risk of interception . Stimulated by evidence of this risk  --  ashes mingled with burned bones and scraps of leather  --  Reith , Traz and Anacho accelerated their pace . Half-trotting , half-running they gained the haven of the Boulder Path , where Dirdir did not care to hunt , without untoward inci-dent . They put down their packs and stretched out to rest . Almost at once a pair of hulking figures drew near : men of no race identifiable to Reith , brown of skin with long tangled black hair and curly beards . They wore rags ; they stank abominably and inspected the three with truculent assurance . " We are in command of these premises , " groaned one in a guttural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each ; if you refuse we will thrust you into the open , and notice ! Dirdir stalk the northern ridge . " Anacho instantly leapt to his feet and with his shovel struck the speaker a great blow on the head . The second man swung his cudgel ; Anacho cut up with his shovel blade , catching the man a maiming blow under the wrists . The cudgel flew aside ; the man tottered back , looking in horror at his hands . They flapped under p 325 his wrists like a pair of empty gloves . Anacho said , " Go forth yourself to face the Dirdir . " He jumped forward with shovel raised ; the two shambled off into the rocks . Anacho watched them go . " We had better move . " The three took their packs and started away ; almost as they did so a great chunk of rock flew down to smash into the ground . Traz jumped up on a boulder and fired his catapult , evoking a wail of distress . The three took themselves a hundred yards south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they commanded a view across the Forelands and yet could not easily be approached from the rear . Settling back , Reith brought out his scanscope and studied the landscape . He discerned half a dozen furtive takers , and a band of Dirdir on a promontory to the east . For ten minutes the Dirdir stood immobile , then suddenly disappeared . A moment later he picked them out again , moving with long lunging strides down the slope and out upon the Forelands . During the afternoon , with no Dirdir in view , takers began to venture from the Boulder Patch . Reith , Traz and Anacho climbed the slope , making for the ridge as directly as caution permitted . They were alone now . Not a sound could be heard . What with the need for stealth , progress was slow ; sunset found them toiling up a gulch just below the ridge , and they came forth just in time to see the last corroded sliver of Carina 4269 fade from sight . To the south the ground sloped in long rolls and swales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but highly dangerous owing to the proximity of Khusz , about ten miles to the south . With twilight a curious mood , mixed of melancholy and horror , settled over the Carabas . In all directions , winking fires appeared , each with its macabre implication . Amazing , thought Reith , that men , for any inducement whatever , would enter such a place . No more than a quarter-mile distant a fire sprang into existence , and the three quickly crouched into the shadows . The pale shapes of the Dirdir were clear to the naked eye . Reith studied them through the scanscope . They stalked back and forth , their effulgences streaming like long phosphorescent antennae , and they seemed to be emitting sounds too soft to be heard . Anacho whispered , " They use the ' Old State ' of their brains ;  | they are truly wild beasts , just as on the Sibol plains a million years ago . " " Why do they walk back and forth ? " " It is their custom ; they ready themselves for their feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the shadows lay two heaving shapes . " They 're alive ! " whispered Reith in dis-may . Anacho grunted . " The Dirdir do n't care to carry burdens . The prey must run alongside , hopping and leaping like the Dirdirall day if need be . If the prey flags , they sting him with nerve-fire and he runs with greater agility . " Reith put down the scanscope . Anacho spoke in a voice carefully toneless : " You see them now in the ' Old State , ' as wild beasts , which is their elemental nature . They are magnificent . In other cases they show magnificence of a different sort . Men can not judge them , but merely stand back in awe . " " What of the elite Dirdirmen ? " " The Immaculates ? What of them ? " " Do they imitate the Dirdir at hunting ? " Anacho looked off over the dark Zone . In the east a pink flush heralded the rising of the moon Az . " The Immaculates hunt . Naturally they can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Zone . " He glanced toward the nearby fire . " In the morning the wind will blow from us to them . Best that we move on through the dark . " Az , low in the sky , cast a pink sheen over the landscape ; Reith could think only of watered blood . They moved east and south , picking a painful way across the rocky bones of old Tschai . The Dirdir fire receded and passed from sight behind a bluff . For a period the three descended toward the Stage . They halted to sleep a fitful few hours , then once more continued down through the Hills of Recall . Az now hung low in the west , while Braz lifted into the east . The night was clear ; every object showed a double pink and blue shadow . Traz went into the lead , watching , listening , testing each step . Two hours before dawn he stopped short and motioned his comrades to stillness . " Dead smoke , " he whispered . " A camp ahead . . . something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave back only silence .  | Moving with utmost stealth , Traz angled away on a new route , up over a ridge , down through a copse of feather-fronds . Once more halting to listen , Traz suddenly gestured the other two back into deep shade . From concealment they saw on the brow of the hill a pair of pale shapes , which stood silent and alert for ten minutes , then abruptly vanished . Reith whispered , " Did they know we were near ? " " I do n't think so , " Traz muttered . " Still , they might have picked up our scent . " Half an hour later they went cautiously forward , keeping to the shadows . Dawn colored the east ; Az was gone , followed by Braz . The three hurried through plum-colored gloom , and finally took shelter in a dense clump of torquil . At sunrise , among the litter of twigs and curled black leaves , Traz found a node the size of his two fists . When cracked loose from its brittle stem and split , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of scarlet fire . " Beautiful ! " whispered Anacho . " Enough to excite avidity ! A few more finds like this and we could abandon Adam Reith 's insane plan . " They searched further through the copse , but found nothing more . Daylight revealed the South Stage savanna stretching east and west into the haze of distance . Reith studied his map , comparing the mountain behind with the depicted relief . " Here we are . " He touched down his finger . " The Dirdir returning to Khusz pass yonder , west of the Boundary Woods , which is our destination . " " No doubt our destiny as well , " remarked Anacho with a pessimistic sniff . " I would as soon die killing Dirdir as any other way , " said Traz . " One does not die killing Dirdir , " Anacho corrected him delicately . " They do not permit it . Should someone make the attempt they prickle him with nerve-fire . " " We 'll do our best , " said Reith . Lifting the scanscope he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting parties , scanning the slopes for game . A wonder , thought Reith , that any men whatever survived to return to Maust . The day passed slowly . Traz and Anacho searched under the  | scrub for nodes , without success . During the middle afternoon a hunt crossed the slope not half a mile distant . First came a man bounding like a deer , his legs extending mightily forward and back . Fifty yards behind ran three Dirdir without exertion . The fugitive , despairing , halted with his back to a rock and prepared to fight ; he was swarmed upon and overwhelmed . The Dirdir crouched over the prostrate form , performed some sort of manipulation , then stood erect . The man lay twitching and thrashing . " Nerve-fire , " said Anacho . " Somehow he annoyed them , perhaps by carrying an energy weapon . " The Dirdir trooped away . The victim , by a series of grotesque efforts , gained his feet , and started a lurching flight toward the hills . The Dirdir paused , looked after him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned and followed the Dirdir . They began to run , bounding in feral exuberance . Behind , running with crazy abandon , came their captive . The group disappeared to the north . Anacho said to Reith , " You intend to pursue your plans ? " Reith felt a sudden yearning to be out of the Carabas , as far away as possible . " I understand why the plan has n't been tried before . " Afternoon faded into a sad and gentle evening . As soon as fires appeared along the hillsides , the three departed their covert and set off to the north . At midnight they reached the Boundary Wood . Traz , fearing the sinuous half-reptilian beast known as the smur , was reluctant to enter . Reith made no argument and the three kept to the fringe of the forest until dawn . With the coming of light they performed a cautious exploration , and found nothing more noxious than fluke lizards . From the western edge of the woods Khusz was clearly visible , only three miles south ; entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the afternoon , after careful assessment of all the potentialities of the woods , the three set to work . Traz dug , Anacho and Reith worked to fabricate a great rectangular net , using twigs , branches and the cord they had brought in their packs . On the evening of the following day the apparatus was complete . Surveying the system Reith alternated between hope and despair . Would the Dirdir react as he hoped they might ? Anacho seemed to think so , though he spoke much of nerve-fire and exhibited intense pessimism .  | Middle morning and early afternoon , when the hunts returned to Khusz , were theoretically the productive periods . Earlier and later the Dirdir tended to go forth ; the attention of these groups the three did not care to attract . The night passed and the sun rose on a day which one way or another must prove to be fateful . For a time it seemed that rain would fall , but by midmorning the clouds had drifted south ; in the suddenly clear air the light of Carina 4269 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the woods , sweeping the landscape through his scanscope . To the north appeared a party of four Dirdir loping easily along the trail of Khusz . " Here they come , " said Reith . " This is it . " The Dirdir came bounding down the trail , giving occasional whistles of exuberance . Hunting had been good ; they had enjoyed themselves . But look ! What was there ? A man-beast at the edge of the forest ! What did the fool do here so close to Khusz ? The Dirdir sprang in happy pursuit . The man-beast ran for his life , as did all such creatures . It faltered early and stood at bay , back to a tree . Venting their horrifying death-cry the Dirdir lunged forward . Under the feet of the foremost the ground gave way ; he dropped out of sight . The remaining three halted in amazement . A sound : a crackle , a thrash ; on top of them fell a mat of twigs , under which they were trapped . And here came men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage tearing their viscera , they struggled vainly against the mat , desperately intent to win free , to submerge the wicked men in hate and horror .. . The Dirdir were killed , by stabbing , hewing and blows of the shovel . The mat was raised , the bodies stripped of sequins and dragged away , the deadfall repaired . A second group came down from the north : only three , but creatures resplendent in casques , with effulgences like incandescent wires . Anacho spoke in awe : " These are Hundred-Trophy Excellences ! " " So much the better , " Reith signaled to Traz . " Bring them in ; we 'll teach them excellence . " Traz behaved as before , showing himself , then fleeing as if in panic . The Excellences pursued without vehemence ; they had enjoyed a fruitful hunt . The way under the dendrons had been trod-  | den before , perhaps by other hunters . The quarry , curiously enough , showed little of the frantic agility which added zest to the hunt ; in fact , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gnarled torquil . Fantastic ! He waved a blade . Did he challenge them , the Excellences ? Launch forward , leap on him , rend him to the ground , with the trophy to the first to touch him ! But-shock ! ? the ground collapsing , the forest falling ; a delirium of confusion ! And look : submen coming forth with blades , to hack , to stab ! Mind-bursting rage , a frenzy of struggle , hissing and screaming  --  then the blade . There were four slaughters that day , four on the next , five on the third day , by which time the process had become an efficient routine . During mornings and evenings the bodies were buried and the gear repaired . The business seemed as passionless as fish-ing  --  until Reith recalled the hunts he had witnessed and so restored his zeal . The decision to halt the operation derived not from the diminution of profit  --  each party of hunters carried booty to a value of as much as twenty thousand sequins  --  or any lessening of fervor on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clears , milks and sards the booty was an almost unmanageable bulk , and Anacho 's pessimism had become apprehension . " Sooner or later the parties will be missed . There will be a search ; how could we escape ? " " One more kill , " said Traz . " Here now comes a group , rich from their hunting . " " But why ? We have all the sequins we can carry ! " " We can discard our sards and some emeralds , and carry only reds and purples . " Anacho looked at Reith , who shrugged . " One more band . " Traz went to the edge of the forest and performed his now well-schooled simulation of panic . The Dirdir failed to react . Had they seen him ? They advanced with no acceleration of pace . Traz hesitated a moment , then once again showed himself . The Dirdir saw him ; apparently they had also seen him on the first occasion , for instead of leaping into immediate pursuit , they continued their easy jog . Watching from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or merely sated with hunting . The Dirdir halted to examine the track into the forest . They  | came into the wood slowly , one in the lead , another behind , two holding up the rear . Reith faded back to his post . " Trouble , " he told Anacho . " We may have to fight our way out . " " ' Fight ' ? " cried Anacho . " Four Dirdir , three men ? " Traz , a hundred yards down the trail , decided to stimulate the Dirdir . Stepping into the open , he aimed his catapult at the foremost and fired a bolt into the creature 's chest . It gave a whistle of outrage and sprang forward , effulgences stiff and furiously bright . Traz dodged back , went to stand in his usual spot , a grin of irrational pleasure on his face . He brandished his blade . The wounded Dirdir charged , and crashed into the pitfall . Its yells became a weird keening of shock and pain . The remaining three stopped short , then came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net release ; it dropped , capturing two ; one danced back . Reith came forth . He yelled to Anacho and Traz . " Kill those under the net ! " He jumped through the tangle to confront the remaining Dirdir . Under no circumstances must it escape . Escape was remote from its mind . It sprang upon Reith like a leopard , ripping with its talons . Traz ran forward brandishing his dagger and threw himself on the Dirdir 's back . The Dirdir rolled over backward , and tearing Traz 's legs loose , made play with his own dagger . Anacho leaped forward ; with one mighty swordstroke he hacked apart the Dirdir 's arm ; with a second blow he clove the creature 's head . Staggering and tottering , cursing and panting , the three finished off the remaining Dirdir , then stood in vast relief that they had fared so well . Blood pumped from Traz 's leg . Reith applied a tourniquet , opened the first-aid kit he had brought with him to Tschai . He disinfected the wound , applied a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film of synthetic skin , and eased off the tourniquet . Traz grimaced , but made no complaint . Reith brought forth a pill . " Swallow this . Can you stand ? " Traz rose stiffly to his feet . " Can you walk ? " " Not too well . " " Try to keep moving , to prevent the leg from going stiff . " Reith and Anacho searched the corpses for booty , to their enormous profit : a purple node , two scarlets , a deep blue ,
