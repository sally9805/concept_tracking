The latest from a young man who is without question Russia 's most exciting pianist , this recital disc pairs two romantic masterpieces , the Bach-Busoni Chaconne and Schumann 's Kreisleriana , plus a pair of shorter pieces by Beethoven ( Rondo for Piano in G Major is one ) . These spectacular performances  --  big-boned and expansive , yet piercingly direct whenever they need to be  --  rank among the very best on record . Not since Vladimir Horowitz was in his absolute prime have we been privy to classical piano playing quite as bold , quite as ambitious as this . <P>  --  By Terry Teachout
