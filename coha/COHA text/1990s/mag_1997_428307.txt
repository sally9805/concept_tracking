They 've done the curls , the presses , the squats and dips . You 've worked them hard week after week , yet for some reason , your results are n't matching your efforts . <p> Here 's why : Your muscles are bored . They 're jaded . They 're like Charlie Sheen after a week at Club Med  --  wondering when the party is really going to start . <p> Your body needs a wake-up call  --  an action plan that rouses your muscles from their coma . We have one . It 's called tri-sets-groups of three exercises that work the same body part , done with little or no rest in between .

" Two sets of three tri-sets takes no more than 30 minutes , " says Abdo . The key , of course , is to limit conversation and move quickly from one exercise to the next . <p> Tri-sets , though , are not for beginners . You must be strong enough to maintain good form in all three exercises , says Hank Drought , C.S.C.S. , owner of Strength &; Conditioning Personal Trainers Consulting in Boston . <p> The following tri-sets for quadriceps , chest and back use simple exercises that can be done at one or two stations with some strategically placed dumbbells .
