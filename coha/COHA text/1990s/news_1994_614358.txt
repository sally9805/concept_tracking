<p> Teresa Wynn has spent all of her 30 years living in poverty . Struggling to raise her sons in public housing , she is a symbol of the masses of people Jimmy Carter is trying to reach with The Atlanta Project . <p> At 1 a.m. , the gangsta rappers start screaming on the neighbor 's stereo upstairs . The beat , at full volume , rumbles like thunder . One floor below , Teresa Wynn 's four children begin their nightly dance - twisting , rolling and murmuring in their sleep on old , worn beds . <p> Roaches the size of almonds steady themselves on the vibrating walls . A rapper 's mean voice seems to shout from Teresa 's dark , little bathroom : <p> " I got my finga on the trigga/My mind is playin ' tricks on me . " <p> The rappers are still yelling when Teresa 's sons - Anthony , Darrell , Jarrod and Branden - wake up drained , as usual , at 6:30 a.m . <p> After they leave for school , she sits in the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondering if the real-life gangsters outdoors will trouble her sons today . <p> " I do n't want to live in this place for the rest of my life , " said Teresa , a 30-year-old single mother living on welfare in Atlanta 's Englewood Manor public housing project . " I need help . All I need is a chance . " <p> Teresa is the kind of person that everyone says they want to help : President Clinton with his plans for welfare reform , Jimmy Carter with his talk of improving the lives of the bone-poor through The Atlanta Project . <p> To spend time in Teresa 's world is to better understand the monotonous rhythms of poverty and public assistance , as well as the obstacles that must be overcome if new programs are to fuel hope and break the cycle . <p> For Teresa and millions of others , it is rarely as simple as just getting work . A job means a paycheck and self-esteem , but it also can mean the loss of the security of medical insurance and other public assistance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teresa risks failure , and another reminder that she could remain poor forever and that her children 's futures might be no better than her own . <p> How Teresa wound up in this dry cycle is like a sad tale on the TV news . She was abandoned at birth by her teenage mom . Three sympathetic women passed her back and forth , raising her on welfare as best they could . <p> Now Teresa lives by their example . At 15 , she bore her first child and dropped out of school with the reading skills of a third-grader . At 16 , and ever since , she has been on welfare . She has had three more boys by three fathers . <p> In her living room , she draws on a cigarette , allows the bluish smoke to curl in her mouth , and talks about the steps she has taken to ensure that her sons do not inherit her legacy . <p> ' I 'm so proud of myself ' <p> Teresa 's hopes are high this year . A friend told her in February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Habitat for Humanity . A month later , the organization told her the most important qualification was holding a job for six months to a year . <p> Since then , she has been on a tear . Within two weeks , Teresa volunteered with The Atlanta Project , answering phones and entering data . The project wants to help people find ways to improve conditions in their communities , but Teresa simply hoped it could refer her to a decent job . <p> Then , on her own , Teresa found temporary work stocking shoes . She opened a savings account with her $ 758-a-month take-home pay . <p> She knew her new income would cause problems . Her monthly welfare check was chopped from $ 330 to $ 61 and her food-stamp allotment from $ 406 to $ 199 . Her subsidized rent and utility bill were increased from $ 71 to $ 150 a month . <p> If Teresa continued earning $ 700 monthly for four months , she would lose the lion 's share of her welfare benefits , and the housing authority would jack up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her adult life , none of that mattered to Teresa . " I 'm so proud of myself because this is the first time I 've done this , " she said shortly after getting the job . " I 've put $ 400 in the bank since I started working at Shoe World . " <p> But only a lace holds the shoe job together . Set to end after Easter , the job is now day-to-day . <p> Shoe World cut back Teresa 's working hours such that she now takes home no more than $ 85 a week . With fewer hours , fewer earned dollars and fewer government benefits , getting a job is looking like a losing proposition . <p> " It makes me want to quit sometimes , " she said , " but I have to be strong and hang in there . " <p> Teresa 's boss , Everett Harvey , wants to keep her on the job . " She 's always here early . When I ask her to do something , she does it , no questions asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Two years ago , Teresa 's attempt at independence failed . On a whim , she enrolled in preparatory classes for her general equivalency diploma at the Center for Black Women 's Wellness . " I thought basically it would n't be that hard , " Teresa said . <p> But the work was tough and Teresa was distracted : Who would welcome her boys home from school ? Should she have turned down an offer of a car ride to the grocery ? Was some kid burglarizing her home ? <p> Months dragged on . Her reading skills inched upward only slightly . Discouraged , Teresa walked away . <p> " When it came to academics , she was intimidated , " said Diana Moore , the center 's associate director . " She would n't attend regularly . When we got on her about it , I think she got a little discouraged and felt it was time to move on . " <p> Moore 's unflattering interpretation stung Teresa . <p> Teresa said she fell in love with the center because of its mission to help poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged other women to follow her example . <p> " I was determined , " Teresa said . " I was willing to do anything for them . " <p> But soon her admiration dimmed . She dropped out shortly after she got a new instructor she considered harsh . " He talked to me like a child , " Teresa said . <p> Moore said Teresa 's real problem was within . Most women at the center read on a fifth-grade level or higher , and Teresa quickly fell behind . <p> " She 's a very motivated individual , " Moore said . " Very determined . A good heart . She just has trouble reading . She gave it as much as she had to give , then she lost interest . " <p> Teresa disagreed but still regretted her failed attempt at education . " I think it 's just me , " she said . " I 'm more scared of failing than anything . " <p> Failing to do better is the one thing that frightens Teresa more than living in Englewood . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better lives than hers . <p> " I 'm lucky to be alive , " Teresa said . Her mother , she believes , tried to abort her with a coat hanger . <p> Teresa 's aunt , Rolene Varner , told her the story a few years back when she asked about discrepancies on her birth certificate . Varner said Teresa 's mother , then 16 , sneaked out of Grady Memorial Hospital and left her newborn in an incubator on Nov. 1 , 1963 . <p> Baby Teresa was carried from the maternity ward to the Summerhill community by her father 's mother , Mattie Maddox . <p> " I never understood why my mama did n't want me , " said Teresa , " but my grandmama loved me deep . " <p> When she was 8 , Teresa woke up one morning and bounded into her grandmother 's bedroom . She shook the dead woman gently , but Maddox laid in bed like a toy without batteries . <p> Her father , Ned Maddox , and aunt decided who would take Teresa next . They made an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one person she truly did not want to live with . <p> The girl was sure her mother could not love her . The woman had been only 16 when Teresa was born , almost tragically , weighing 1 pound , 10 ounces . <p> Teresa kicked and whined all the way to Diane 's house when she returned to reclaim the 8-year-old after Mattie Maddox 's death . <p> Diane could do nothing to please Teresa . Her hugs seemed rigid ; her kisses seemed dry . Teresa 's stepsisters considered her a brat who siphoned their mother 's attention . <p> " I tried to stay with her , but I just could n't , " Teresa said . " My sisters and me just did n't get along . My aunt would buy me stuff , and they 'd just take it . One day when I was supposed to go to school , I ran away . " <p> Teresa ran to her aunt Rolene Varner , who adopted and mothered her for more than seven years . Varner 's love was not enough . In 1978 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome ninth-grader who had been in and out of jail since he was 12 . <p> Hudson was dangerous but charming . " I was 14 . I was young , " Teresa said . " His money attracted me to him . " <p> Teresa stayed with him until his involvement with drugs scared her . Before she left , Hudson touched Teresa in a way no one else had . She became pregnant with her first boy , Anthony . <p> ' I was a hot mama ' <p> A year later , Teresa left her aunt 's home with Anthony to seek more independence and wound up in Englewood Manor , where she lives today . She moved in with her father 's old girlfriend , Hazel Hayes , whom she now refers to as her mother . <p> Teresa 's chances of improving on her mother 's life were nearly empty . She had dropped out of 10th grade before leaving her aunt 's home , and she could read no better than a 7-year-old . <p> She did not have a woman 's education , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot mama , " she said . " I wanted my own money , I wanted to be out on my own . I wanted my own place . " <p> Still looking for love , Teresa ran into Darrell Hackney , whom she met before leaving high school . " He played basketball , " Teresa said . " He was popular . I liked that . " <p> She moved out of Englewood a year later and rented a bungalow with Hackney in Summerhill . Life seemed fine , except when they fought . Teresa , then 16 , got a job at Mrs. Winner 's fried chicken for $ 171 a week . <p> After three months , Teresa quit her job to attend Roosevelt High School . " I had been talking to the counselors there , and they were willing to help , " she said . <p> At Roosevelt , Teresa felt too big for the hard little desks . She felt that teachers had no power over her , especially since she was an adult who had been out on her own . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You had to ask someone to go to the restroom . I just left . " <p> Teresa realizes staying in school for only seven months was a mistake . " It was easier then to get what I needed . Now you have to take all these tests . My life would 've been better had I stuck with it . " <p> By her 21st birthday , Teresa had quit everything but her relationship with Hackney , who was changing before her eyes . He was more violent . One month , he gambled away the utility money . Later , he gambled away the rent . <p> Teresa went to Grady for an overnight stay one day after her nerves went haywire . When she returned home , her belongings were curbside and the landlord had bolted the door shut . <p> Teresa and her baby , Anthony , were homeless . Another baby , Darrell Jr. , was on the way . <p> After a few months in a homeless shelter , Teresa was back in the projects at Carver Homes . After more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englewood to be near her surrogate mother , Hazel Hayes . <p> But being closer to Hayes did not make the projects any better . Seeking to get out , Teresa fell into the arms of yet another man , Nelson Huff , who fathered Jarrod . " I was alone and needed someone , " Teresa said . <p> Like the other men in her life , Huff left , denying that Jarrod was his son until a blood test proved it . <p> Nearly seven years ago , Teresa found Brent Smith , who fathered Branden and continues to provide for his son . <p> " I regret ever being with Steve , Darrell and Nelson , " Teresa said . " They 're not daddy figures . " They were lone wolves who made her tough life even tougher , she said . <p> But the fault was not all theirs , she admits . " Only Darrell and Branden 's births were planned , " she said . " I do n't believe in abortion . I do n't wish I never had my kids . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases . " <p> Life goes on , she said . Teresa is learning a work ethic from Smith , who drives an 18-wheeler . She studied for her high school equivalency diploma and later took a job at a day-care center . <p> That job paid about $ 175 a week , at best . But sometimes it paid only half that , and it cost her much of her public assistance in the process . <p> " Once these women begin to get their heads above water , their benefits are deducted or cut and they start going back under , " said Ellery Hill , executive director of the day-care center . " To get off the welfare system , they have to get a good-paying job , not just a job . " <p> Teresa quit that job , but there was still plenty to keep her busy . Raising four children on welfare in a tough Atlanta housing project makes most jobs seem easy , she said . On many days , everyday tasks such as cashing a check or shopping for groceries seem like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every check she cashes . To go almost anywhere , Teresa pays $ 1.25 one way for a city bus ride . <p> Englewood is a desert island . Winn-Dixie and Kroger groceries are nearly 2 1/2 miles south . A smaller grocer is about 10 blocks away in the shadow of the federal penitentiary . A soiled , bleak gas station about four blocks away doubles as a convenience store . <p> Residents eagerly await the daily arrival of Pop 's Store , a rusting school bus that doubles as a convenience store . On bald tires , the bus stops at various corners in the project . Residents hop aboard to purchase anything from tea to toilet paper . <p> On sunny days , drug dealers in brightly colored sweatshirts line the narrow streets . Business is slow but steady , as buyers in cars roll to a stop and beckon to them . <p> In the summer , Atlanta police put the heat on and occasionally surprise the dealers with a chase . One or two are caught , residents said , but the bad guys nearly always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some residents said , but the real crime is the condition of their apartments . Ceilings swell with water from busted pipes . Plaster falls in bathtubs , or , in one instance , on Teresa 's head . <p> " I 've tried to complain to management , " she said , " but they do n't do nothing . " <p> Returning home from school after restless nights , the boys often have something bad to report . " Jarrod punched his principal , " Teresa said . " Darrell ruined a perfect five-year school attendance record for fightin ' . . . . Anthony 's basketball coach said he has an attitude problem . <p> " People do n't understand the pain , the headaches , " she said . " I wonder if there 's something wrong with me , that I ca n't do what other people do . They can read , they can get good jobs . " <p> A three-bedroom desert <p> Teresa crushed a cigarette butt in a tin ashtray . Her story that began with hope had ended almost without it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could see most of what she calls her three-bedroom desert . <p> The stereo was off , but the apartment was full of the blues . " I feel bad , " Teresa said . " I feel like there 's no out . I 'm stuck here in a place I do n't want to be . " <p> She wondered if her oldest boy , 16-year-old Anthony , was selling drugs . " There are a lot of ways he can hide it from me , " she said . <p> " I worry about my kids because of the gang violence , the drugs , " she said . " The only thing I can do is just keep praying . " <p> The Atlanta Project is in Teresa 's prayers . She hopes maybe they can help find her a job , or at least a patient school tutor . <p> Until then , she would have to rely on Darrell Jr. , 10 , to read the mail . Every day , he walks in the door from school , reads his mother 's mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before Darrell completes his chores , Jarrod is already playing near the garbage bin in view of the apartment 's picture window . Anthony , hoping pro sports is in his future , is usually at Southside High School playing junior varsity basketball . Branden , 4 , plays inside with his toys . <p> By 10:30 p.m. , she said , they are all in bed . <p> Teresa watched mayhem on the 11 p.m. news one night as the boys fooled around in their rooms before falling asleep . " Everything they say is true , " she said of WAGA 's eyewitness horrors . <p> About midnight , she drifted into sleep . In an hour or so , the roaches would be still . The mice would stop chewing through the baseboards . The walls would shake . And screams would haunt the hall . <p> A warning would come from the bathroom , as it does night after night : <p> " I got my finga on the trigga/My mind is playin ' tricks on me. "
