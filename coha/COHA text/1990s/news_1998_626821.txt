<p> Jurors who cleared Robert Angleton last week in his estranged wife 's 1997 slaying did not wade through three days of deliberations with a shortage of evidence . <p> But there were things the panel did n't see or hear - bits of information and testimony from both sides that seem just as bizarre and intriguing as the evidence they did consider . <p> Both prosecutors and the defense avoid speculation on whether the information would have changed the outcome of the capital murder trial , but both sides agree it could have added new dimensions to deliberations . <p> At the very least , more information would have meant more work for the jury . <p> In all , eight days of trial produced about 400 exhibits , among them tapes , maps , aerial photographs , bank records , police statements and chilling notes outlining the slaying . Jurors heard testimony from 59 witnesses and looked on as both sides played out dueling theories in front of a judge determined to keep the trial moving . <p> Angleton , an ex-bookie and police informant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 16 , 1997 , murder with his brother , Roger . As a result , Angleton dodged a death sentence and handed Harris County prosecutors a rare defeat . <p> Prosecutors argued Angleton hired his oddball brother to kill his wife because an impending divorce threatened his fortune . The defense countered that their client was a victim of a frame-up . <p> But jurors never saw one big key to that theory . <p> Both brothers were arrested for the slaying on Aug. 1 , 1997 . But Roger Angleton later killed himself in jail , leaving behind notes saying he framed his brother in an elaborate extortion plot . <p> State District Judge Brian Rains ruled the notes were hearsay and did not fall under the exceptions that allow such evidence during trial . <p> The defense team of Michael Ramsey , Stanley Schneider and George Tyson wanted jurors to see the notes , especially because other writings by Roger Angleton , which outlined the murder plot , were allowed into evidence . Those writings were also hearsay , but Rains allowed them in because they were written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The defense tried a variety of arguments to get the suicide notes into evidence . <p> They said the suicide notes were a dying declaration by Roger Angleton , but prosecutors said they were just a last attempt by Roger Angleton to give his brother an alibi and could n't be a dying man 's confession because he had time for reflection before writing them . <p> The defense said the notes were statements Roger Angleton made against his own interest , something that could have been used against him in trial . Prosecutors said that did n't fit because Roger Angleton escaped any legal consequences by killing himself . <p> But the primary defense argument for the suicide notes was that the earlier writings essentially equated to testimony from Roger Angleton . If Roger Angleton had lived to testify , they could have used his last statements to impeach his story . Prosecutors disagreed with that theory and so did Rains . <p> A procession of defense attorneys interviewed by the Houston Chronicle criticized Rains ' ruling on the notes after the trial ended . <p> Mac Secrest , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suicide notes were clever , but clearly jurors should have seen the writings . <p> Secrest said keeping the notes out was risky in such a high stakes trial because if Robert Angleton had lost , that decision alone could have constituted reversible error . <p> Other defense attorneys such as Dan Cogdell , Kent A. Schaffer , Chris Flood and Brian Wice agreed . <p> " I was really surprised that they were not admitted for the jury 's consideration , " said Schaffer , president of the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association . " I think the law is abundantly clear on the issue and could n't understand why they did n't make their way to the jury . " <p> But prosecutor Lyn McClellan said the judge made the right call on the notes . Besides , he says , jurors probably knew about the suicide notes before trial started thanks to the media coverage the case received . And that might have been in the back of their minds during deliberations , he said . <p> And it 's not as if there was evidence from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide notes had been admitted prosecutors were prepared to call Vanessa Leggett to testify . She 's writing a book on the case and spent hours interviewing Roger Angleton before his death . <p> The jailhouse interviews were taped , and prosecutors say Leggett was prepared to testify that Roger Angleton had told her of her brother 's involvement in the murder plot . But Rains had indicated the tapes probably were n't admissible . <p> That effectively limited Leggett 's testimony as to what Roger Angleton told her , but would have left her open to cross-examination . <p> Lead defense attorney Michael Ramsey said that was one round of questioning he was looking forward to . Members of the defense team say the trial would still be going on if she had testified . <p> Ramsey said Roger Angleton also told Leggett lots of wild stories about Mafia hitmen , things meant to " puff up " the value of her book and feed his need to live in a " Walter Mitty and James Bond " world . <p> Prosecutors also avoided calling their own voice expert to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two voice analysis experts to attack an incriminating tape found on Roger Angleton . <p> Prosecutors said the tape , which was played for jurors , contained the voices of the two brothers plotting the murder . But the two defense experts , including one who once worked for prosecutors , said it was " possible " to eliminate Robert Angleton 's voice from the tape . <p> McClellan said in hindsight he still would not call the state 's expert to testify , even though he was ready to say he thought it was Robert Angleton 's voice on the tape . <p> Defense attorneys were ready to attack how the state expert conducted his test , and McClellan said he thought the voice identification by people who knew the defendant and the content of the tape was more damning . <p> Besides , McClellan said the defense would have called a third expert from New York if the state 's expert had testified , and the waters would have been muddied more by a number of dueling experts . <p> McClellan said jurors also never saw evidence that police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house - a note from Roger Angleton to his brother that prosecutors say would have " negated " the suicide notes . <p> Ramsey said that evidence would have been troublesome to the defense , but it was clearly inadmissible because it was outside the scope of the search warrant . Prosecutors agreed . <p> The jury also never heard testimony that Robert Angleton allegedly tried to contract for his wife 's murder with someone other than his brother , according to sources familiar with the case . <p> Prosecutors would n't comment on that evidence , but Ramsey and his co-counsel , Stanley Schneider , said the witness in that instance came with " a lot of baggage , " and his story conflicted with the plot that prosecutors were following . <p> As for defense witnesses who never made it to the stand , there was Robert Angleton 's mother . <p> Schneider said she was ready to testify that Roger had called her to pass threats on to Robert Angleton in 1991 and 1997 and that he essentially admitted to her that he killed Doris Angleton in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin Templeton , the Houston vice officer who was Robert Angleton 's control when he worked as a police informant . <p> Templeton identified Robert Angleton as one of the voices on the murder tape , but defense attorneys were n't allowed to explore what kind of pressure they said he was under from within the department to be a good witness for the state . <p> Rains would n't allow it after prosecutors protested and said there was no pressure on Templeton and that anything not involving his connection to the case was irrelevant <p> But whatever the unseen tidbits , it all comes back to Rains ' rulings , which defense attorneys say might have been colored by the judge 's strict courtroom demeanor . <p> Several local defense attorneys were critical of the way Rains dealt with Ramsey . They say the judge seemed to reprimand Ramsey more than the other attorneys by cutting him off in mid-sentence , intervening in his cross-examination , silencing protracted arguments from him and telling him to sit down . <p> " If a defense lawyer demonstrated anything like what Rains demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York minute , " Cogdell said . <p> Wice agreed and said : " I consider Brian a delight off the bench , but his bedside manner in court needs some work . . . . You expect that kind of handling from a judge with someone who has a law license where the ink is still drying , but Mike Ramsey ? He 's one of the best criminal defense lawyers in the free world . " <p> Rains said his task was to keep the trial moving quickly and not to bog down jurors with what he thought were repetitive questions from the lawyers . <p> For his part , Ramsey would not criticize the judge directly . <p> " I think that no serious case should be rushed , no matter how high the pressure gets . Classy people should be , if not courteous , at least civil and civility is the highest virtue a judge can have , " Ramsey said . " I think that the jury wanted more proof than less . I do n't think they were being burdened by time-consuming questioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Rains said everyone is entitled to their opinion , and he declined to discuss the Angleton verdict , the evidence or the personalities involved in trial . <p> " When they told me this case was going to last three weeks , I said , ' There 's no way ' and I made every effort to make sure the trial went on without too much time . . . . The personalities and me doing my job are not the story , " Rains said . " The case is the story . I 'm trying to be the judge , and I 'm making sure that both sides get a fair trial . I 'm also protecting the interest of the jury . If someone is getting offended by that , that 's their problem . " <p> Rains said he will not hesitate to scold any lawyer who is wasting a jury 's time , and if someone has a complaint they can contact the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct . <p> Defense attorneys aside , the judge does have his defenders , and many lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jury in this case , who were interviewed by the Chronicle , gave Rains high marks for his fairness and the way he handled the complex case , as did McClellan . <p> McClellan said that Rains has rebuked him before for repetitive questioning and that the judge might have rubbed members of the defense bar the wrong way because he did n't always agree with Ramsey . <p> " Ramsey is used to getting his way when he steps into court and when he does n't he thinks something is wrong , " McClellan said . " A lot of judges bend over backwards for high-profile attorneys like him , this judge did n't and this defendant was n't kept from putting in any evidence that was legally admissible . " <p> Besides , McClellan points out , Ramsey ultimately got his way - Robert Angleton walked out of court a free man . <p>
