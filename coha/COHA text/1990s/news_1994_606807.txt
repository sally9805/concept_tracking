<p> Conjuring up Christmas breakfast just as the last gift is unwrapped may seem like an act of magic , but with some advance planning you , too , can be a magician . <p> The tough part about Christmas breakfast is that it 's the only feast I know of where the party begins before most of the guests have had a chance to brush their teeth . It must cater to an inter-generational audience whose idea of great food ranges from Fruit Loops to smoked salmon , and it requires a presentation bountiful enough to ward off hunger from dawn to almost lunch . <p> To pull off this kind of magic , the average cook does n't need to know sleight of hand . More important is a practical menu and the desire to cook . <p> The following menu can be made almost entirely ahead of time . Many of the dishes can be frozen or refrigerated for several days . Some of them , such as the cheesecake , actually improve with a period of storage . All that 's needed the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fruit salad . Everything else is ready to go when you are . <p> If you do freeze some of these items , make sure you give them ample time to defrost . Large items might need a day or two in the refrigerator to soften up . Likewise , refrigerated foods that will not be reheated , such as the flavored butters , need to be brought to room temperature for at least an hour before being served . <p> When preparing , think ahead to how you want the food to be presented . Bake the ricotta bread pudding in an attractive baking dish or plan a nest of holly greens or a decorative napkin to help mask the dish on the buffet table . Store the butters in ramekins or bowls that can go directly from the fridge to the table and toss the fruit salad right in its serving bowl . <p> As well as eliminating last minute tasks by cooking ahead , this menu is designed to contain something for everyone . Although your children may not want Hot Pepper Honey Butter on their crepes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate butter . Even if ricotta bread pudding does n't sound appetizing , they can still have a bowl of the Vanilla Pear Sauce that accompanies it . <p> Children who would rather play than sit and eat , or guests who drop in briefly , can munch on a Raisin Bran Breakfast Cookie , a corn stick , a scone , or a Coffee Cake Cupcake without being stuck at a table . <p> Probably the most unusual item in this menu is the Smoked Salmon and Gruye 're Cheesecake . Constructed just like a dessert cheesecake , it has all the richness and creaminess you 'd expect , but without sweeteners . Sugar has been replaced with a saute ' of onion , herbs and smoked salmon , a handful of cheese has taken the place of lemon , and instead of vanilla there is a jolt of vinegar and whiskey . <p> I have been fiddling with cheesecake recipes for more than 25 years , and through much trial and error came up with a technique that yields a flawless cake , without a blemish or crack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The secret is not in the ingredients , but in the baking . I slow it down . And when I say slow , I mean it . I set the oven at 200 degrees and bake the cake for 8 hours . In the recipe that follows , however , I have trimmed the baking time to fit in with hectic holiday schedules . Although the surface is a bit more crackled , the interior is almost as silken as the eight-hour gold standard version . <p> Although most of the following dishes can be fully prepared days ahead , some of them , like the eggs , are better finished off Christmas morning . For those items , the recipes point out steps that can be done ahead , how to store the finished parts , and how to finish the dish just before serving . <p> GINGER CREPES <p> ( 24 to 26 crepes ) <p> These crepes can be easily made ahead . To store , wrap them well in plastic and foil and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for several weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , or wrapped in plastic in a microwave for 2 to 3 minutes at full power . <p> 2 cups flour <p> 2 teaspoons ground ginger <p> 6 extra-large eggs <p> 2 cups milk <p> 1/4 cup oil <p> 2 tablespoons sugar <p> Vegetable shortening spray <p> Using a whisk , mix the flour and ginger with the eggs until all of the flour has been moistened and the mixture is thick and smooth . <p> Heat the milk until steaming .

Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour . <p> To cook the crepes , coat a small ( 6- or 8-inch ) nonstick skillet with a spray shortening . Place over high heat for about 20 seconds until the shortening smokes . Pour 3 to 4 tablespoons of batter into the pan , tilting the pan so that the batter runs over its bottom .
