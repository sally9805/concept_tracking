But Gianetti said he " was not growing academically and athletically the way we figure a student-athlete should be growing at Bloom . <p> " It 's in the best interest of Tederyle that he transfer to a different type of atmosphere . " <p> AMICABLE TRANSFER II : There were no accusations of wrongdoing when sophomore basketball star Antwaun Cubie transferred from Fenwick to Downers Grove South . <p> Cubie , who played on Fenwick 's varsity as a freshman , moved to Downers Grove in August and planned to commute to the Oak Park school .

By the time it is built , there wo n't be anyone smart enough to operate it . <p> Which reminds me , college basketball coaches are scared to death that the NCAA 's 2.5 grade-point requirement for incoming freshmen beginning in 1995 will devastate their programs . <p> That 's because a majority of the top 150 prospects in the nation barely achieve a 2.0 on a 4.0 scale , the current minimum standard . <p> Think of all the great players who would n't have qualified to play as college freshmen if a 2.5 had been in effect in recent years . . . Juwan Howard , Jalen Rose , Jamal Mashburn , Kiwane Garris . <p> That 's why Georgetown 's John Thompson , Temple 's John Chaney , Drake 's Rudy Washington , Southern California 's George Raveling and other black coaches met last Sunday in Chicago  --  to discuss a higher academic standard they say is " discriminatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports . <p> Bullfeathers . <p> We 've heard this song before and it 's tiresome . The coaches do n't accept C ( 2.0 ) performances on the court and they would n't settle for 2.5 ( C-plus ) , either . But apparently they believe it is acceptable to be mediocre in the classroom . . . as long as their players stay eligible . <p> Are they saying the majority of the nation 's best players are n't smart enough to achieve 2.5 , that they are only smart enough to play basketball ? <p> Are n't these the same guys who claim to be educators , the ones who keep preaching the student-athletes ' education is more important than basketball ? <p> Here is a sample of the convoluted hokum they are spreading : <p> It is OK to play 80 games in the spring and summer so you do n't have time to attend summer school . <p> It is OK to attend four exposure camps in July so you can be evaluated by the college coaches . <p> It is OK to participate in AAU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to attend an ACT preparation class . <p> It is OK to learn to shoot the three-point shot so you do n't have time to learn to read or write . <p> It is OK to invite 10 college coaches to visit your home , make five campus visits and spend countless hours a week on the telephone with recruiters so you ca n't do homework , learn how to conjugate a verb or count change . <p> No wonder the coaches are worried the players they count on to make millions of dollars for their colleges and earn them lucrative contracts from shoe companies wo n't be able to qualify . <p> Are they more concerned about the quality of their basketball programs than the quality of their players ' education ? Do you have to ask ? <p> If an NCAA recruiting committee proposal is approved at the NCAA convention in January , it will be OK for coaches to conduct tryouts during campus visits . That 's all you need to know about their priorities . <p> Northwestern 's Ricky Byrdsong did n't attend Sunday 's meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Va . If the 2.5 rule had been in effect when he graduated from high school with a 2.3 , he would n't have qualified for college . But he earned a degree from Iowa State . <p> Byrdsong also reminds only two of 11 blacks on his 1991-92 Detroit squad would have qualified . And all of them are preparing to earn degrees . <p> " In most cases , given proper guidance , kids with less than 2.5 can obtain college degrees , " he said . <p> " If everything was provided for kids to get a proper education , an argument for 2.5 is OK . But the system is so out of line that with all the distractions city kids grow up with , you are asking for the moon . There still is a great disparity between good schools and bad schools .

Eric Chivian Boston , March 21 , 2009 The writer is director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School From the Archives Timeless Tosh from Current Wisdoms Past ( May 1989 ) Los Angeles Times Magazine The battle between the sexes gets rough , as the godlike Susan Littwin reports from the aerobics field of honor : I 'm middle-aged and middle-class and I have no history of violence . In fact , the only thing I do with any physical force at all is exercise , and I do that in a fancy health club in the Valley . So I surprised myself a few weeks ago when I nearly came to blows with a half-naked man in my aerobics class . The man had planted himself front and center in a fast-paced class and refused to budge when the class began moving back and forth across the room . He just stood there , doing his own little duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his territory , he pushed me- hard . This was no warning nudge . This was an outright mean shove . I turned on him like a kid in a schoolyard fight . The music stopped ; luckily , no fists flew . We stood toe to toe , eyes blazing . " Do n't you ever push me again ! " I said , teeth clenched . " You 'd better watch out ! " he lashed back , jaw jutting . Never mind that I felt foolish . What matters to me now is why I was so angry with this otherwise unprepossessing middle-aged man . At the time , I just felt that he was an intruder , an intolerably male and self-important intruder . The truth is- and Fm fully aware that I 'll be called a reverse sexist , but I 've lived with direct sexism a long time , and now it 's my turn- I 'm highly annoyed by men in aerobics classes .
