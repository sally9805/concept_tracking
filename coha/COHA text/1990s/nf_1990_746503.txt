Present screening methods to identify older patients in need of posthospital care planning are overly sensitive and lack specificity , with the rate of false-positive screenings reaching 65 percent . Research was undertaken to develop a computerized screening mechanism to identify elderly cardiac patients at high risk for posthospital care needs . Using the data from the Medicus Nursing Productivity and Quality of Patient Care Classification System ( NPAQ ) as potential predictive factors , the false-positive screening rate was reduced to 26 percent . Early and accurate identification of these patients may prove beneficial to patients and their families and to social workers and hospital administrators . It can improve social worker efficiency in developing and implementing an adequate posthospital care plan , thus enhancing patient recovery . <p> Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and morbidity in persons over age 65 ( National Center for Health Statistics NCHS , 1986 , p. 37 ; U.S. Senate , 1987-88 , p. 98 ) . The special recovery problems of the elderly cardiac patient , such as impairment and decline of physical and mental health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living , and limited access to social health resources , make these people particularly vulnerable to problems in physical recovery that require complex planning prior to discharge from the hospital ( Bangerter &; Smith , 1981 ; Sulman &; Verhaeghe , 1986 ) . <p> Discharge planning , while a professional task for all hospital-based professionals , is a primary responsibility for social workers . Social workers counsel patients and their families for psychological , social , and environmental difficulties related to illness , hospitalization , and posthospital care . Discharge planning frequently involves preparing patients and families for self-care , arranging adequate home care services , and arranging transfers to long-term care facilities . The discharge planning process includes identifying people at risk and assessing their needs . An assessment also is made of the availability of community resources and social support sources . Elderly people account for approximately 50 percent of social work clients in Massachusetts hospitals , with one-fifth of these patients having cardiac diseases ( Berkman &; Abrams , 1986 ) . <p> In 1983 , to contain costs , the federal government initiated diagnostic related groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment to hospitals for Medicare patients . This gives the hospital a large economic incentive to reduce inpatient care costs as well as to reduce patients ' length of stay . DRGs are having a profound impact on the delivery of social work discharge planning services in the hospital ( Caputi &; Heiss , 1984 ; Reamer , 1985 ) . With lengths of stay averaging fewer than 10 days , there is limited time available to deliver optimum discharge planning services . To consider psychosocial needs appropriately , social workers require efficient screening to determine which patients need their help so early intervention can be initiated ( Berkman &; Rehr , 1973 ) . Interest in screening hospitalized cardiac patients grew in part from research which found that nonmedical factors contribute to prolonged hospitalization ( Coulton , 1985 ) and to early readmissions ( Berkman &; Abrams , 1986 ) . It has also been reported that appropriate and timely intervention is related to significant reductions in length of stay ( Berkman &; Henley , 1981 ) . <p> The approaches social workers use at many acute care hospitals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modifications of the Berkman-Rehr-Rosenberg ( 1980 ) high-social-risk screening device . This screening mechanism primarily uses three predictors of need : ( 1 ) life-threatening illness , such as cancer or cardiac disease ; ( 2 ) illnesses that result in physical dysfunction , such as hip fractures and cardiovascular accidents ; and ( 3 ) chronic illness . In this approach , high-social-risk is defined by diagnosis and prognosis rather than by emotional or specific physical dysfunction , which can adversely affect the course of recovery . For example , rather than targeting those among cardiac patients who are at high risk for posthospital needs , this instrument screens in all elderly cardiac patients . Thus , large numbers of cardiac patients are screened into the social work system . Decisions as to who among them actually needs discharge-planning services are made by social workers after an assessment is completed . Social workers at Massachusetts General Hospital judge approximately 35 percent of the screened cardiac patients as needing their services ( a false-positive screening rate of 65 percent ) . <p> Current screening methods require social workers to evaluate significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach with predetermined criteria , using a reliable and valid screening mechanism , is needed so that patient-family needs can be identified early and validly , and appropriate intervention initiated . The purpose of the study was to develop a reliable , valid , and cost-effective mechanism to accurately predict elderly cardiac patients at risk for posthospital care needs . THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK <p> Recovery from cardiac illness represents a significant life transition involving major changes in the adaptive balance or goodness-of-fit between patients and their environment ( Ell , Guzman , &; Haywood , 1983 ) . Because cardiac symptoms may be exacerbated by stress , any factors , whether physiological , psychological , or social , that contribute to the patient 's stress level during this adaptation process constitute risk factors that can impede recovery . Researchers have recognized the unique interplay of physiological , psychological , social , and environmental responses in the successful recovery of cardiac patients ( Berkman &; Abrams , 1986 ; Grauer Birnbom , 1975 ; Sulman &; Verhaeghe , 1986 ) . Consequently , the identification of such risk factors may be predictive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessed the usefulness of the Medicus Nursing Productivity and Quality of Patient Care Classification System ( NPAQ ; Medicus Systems Corporation , 1987 ) as a discharge needs screen . This system is currently used by many acute care teaching hospitals in the United States to assess differential nursing staffing needs by determining patient acuities . Scores are derived from nursing evaluations of a patient 's needs including a patient 's physical and mental disability , his or her ability to function , and patient-family emotional stability . The NPAQ computer-based system may serve as a valuable predictor of patients at risk for discharge needs because it covers a multidimensional range of factors that have been found to be related to patient recovery and currently is used daily by nurses in their routine assessments of every inpatient . <p> The study attempted statistically to use NPAQ 's assessment scores as a valid and reliable screening tool to identify discharge planning needs . The aim was to identify elder patients at high risk for physiological , social , psychological , and environmental problems that could hinder timely and appropriate discharge or negatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question needed to be addressed . Does a screening instrument using NPAQ items correctly identify as many . true positives ( those requiring social services ) and true negatives ( those not requiring social services ) as do current social work professional judgments made after assessment ? METHODS Population <p> The study group included the total census of 650 cardiac patients , aged 65 years or older , admitted between October 1 , 1986 , and July 31 , 1987 , to Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) , a 1,000-bed acute care teaching hospital in Boston , Massachusetts . Patients included were those discharged alive with any one of 11 specific cardiac DRGs as the primary diagnosis . NPAQ data were available on 628 of these patients . Design <p> Three data collection sources were used in this study the hospital 's Master Data Base , the NPAQ data system , and the social service data available in medical records . The following computerized information was available through the hospital Master Data Base : demographic data ( patient name , medical record number , age , sex , marital status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of guarantor , insurance ) , and hospitalization data ( number of previous admissions , length of stay , and DRG ) . Data related to social service contact with the patient were abstracted from the medical record . All patients who received discharge planning by social workers during the study admission period were identified . <p> The NPAQ data are assessed and recorded daily by registered nurses on every inpatient and then are entered into a computerized data system . Data from day three postadmission were obtained from the daily NPAQ reports , including a patient acuity score and specific clinical indicators of acuity , which had been assessed and recorded by nurses . Day three data were chosen because of the desire for early identification of patients in need of services . It is considered critical that screening take place no later than day three after admission so there is adequate time prior to discharge to initiate planning . <p> The NPAQ-system has been proven valid through repeated formal testing in hospitals across the country ( Medicus Systems Corporation , 1987 ) . Reliability has been shown based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores with expected values and interrater reliability testing conducted biweekly on each nursing unit . MGH 's overall reliability runs 92 to 95 percent . Although the information gathered in this study is generalizable only to MGH patients , replication of this study will be feasible in other hospitals that use the NPAQ system . Data Analysis <p> The data from the NPAQ system , the Master Data Base , and the medical record were matched and submitted for computer analysis . Data on 628 patients were analyzed descriptively by examining frequency distributions for the variables . Analysis of the physiological , psychological , and social factors that may predict need for social work services was then undertaken . <p> A random subsample of 411 cases was used to initially identify predictors of need for discharge planning services . The remaining 217 cases were held out for verifying the study findings . Potential key predictive factors were identified using bivariate cross tabulation and analysis of variance of the 411 cases . Variables were deemed potential predictors when they had a statistically significant relationship with the dependent variable  --  use or nonuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standardized measures of association were outside a + or - 0.20 range . Relationships failing to meet these criteria were judged to be too weak to function as reasonable predictors . For cross tabulation the phi or Cramer 's V coefficients were chosen as the standardized measures of association . For analysis of variance , the correlation ratio ( eta ) was used . The choice of cross tabulation or analysis of variance for the initial screening depended on the level of measurement of the variables . In all cases the dependent variable was a dichotomous measure indicating use or nonuse of social service discharge planning . When a potential predictor was a categorical variable , cross tabulation was used . <p> Logistic regression was undertaken to explore what factors , alone or in combination , continued to be predictive when statistical controls were introduced . This procedure was designed specifically to be used when the dependent variable is a dichotomy and the independent variables are a combination of categorical and interval level measures . In a process similar to backwards stepwise regression , nonsignificant predictors were dropped from the logistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dependent variable . The set of predictors that remained after dropping the nonsignificant predictors was designated a model for predicting need for social services . The results of the logistic regression analysis were then verified by replicating the final models of the logistic regression with the holdout subsample of 217 cases and determining whether the models still met criteria for acceptance . FINDINGS <p> The average ( mean ) age of these patients was 75 years . There were slightly more men than women in the sample . Approximately half of the patients were married and living with their spouses . Almost two-fifths of the patients had one or more previous admissions . Circulatory disorders comprised the largest admission diagnosis recorded for slightly over half of the patients . One quarter of the patients were admitted for heart failure and shock . <p> Two hundred and nineteen patients ( 35 percent ) were helped with discharge planning by social workers compared to 409 patients ( 65 percent ) who did not receive social work services during this admission . Patients receiving social work services differed significantly from other patients in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = 1,626 ; p &lt;/= .001 ; eta = .27 ) , more were women , ( Chi 2 = 18.25 ; df = 1 ; p &lt;/= .0001 ; Phi = .17 ) , more were widowed ( Chi 2 = 40.11 ; df = 5 ; p &lt;/= .0001 ; V = .26 ) , end more lived alone ( Chi 2 = 47.0 ; df = 7 ; p &lt;/=.0001 ; V = .27 ) . The social service patients had significantly more nursing care needs on day three ( Table 1 ) and were a significantly higher patient type ( based on acuity rating ) on day three than other patients ( Table 2 ) . In addition , social service patients were significantly more functionally disabled than non-social service patients ( Table 3 ) . Logistic Regression Results <p> The logistic regression was run using variables assessed by nurses on day three postadmission . When the model was run and then validated in the verification sample , two predictors from the NPAQ system and one from the Master Data Base emerged : mobility level on day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission . The logit coefficients and odds ratios for these predictor variables were calculated. 1 ( Table 4 ) . Having had a prior admission and higher patient type increased the likelihood of need for social services . Ability to move around freely on day three reduced the chances that social services were needed for discharge planning . <p> A patient 's ability to walk without assistance on day three was the strongest predictor of not needing social work services . Its logit was .601 , which means a patient who had free mobility on day three was less likely to need social services . The odds ratio corresponding to this logit is 1.82 , implying that mobile patients were 1.82 times as likely as other patients to not need social services . <p> The patient type on day three was the next strongest predictor of need for social services . The negative logit of - .283 implies that patients with higher patient type ( a more severe rating ) are less likely to not need social services ( more likely to need services ) . The odds ratio of .75 indicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients were three-fourths less likely to not need social services ( more likely to need social services ) . <p> Having had a prior admission was the third variable predictive of need for social services . The negative logit of - .141 implies that patients with one or more prior admissions are less likely to not need social services ( more likely to need services ) . The odds ratio of .86 indicates that for each additional admission the patients were .86 times less likely to not need social services ( more likely to need social services ) . <p> The stability of the logit parameter estimates was verified using the holdout verification sample of 217 cases that were not used in the initial model estimation ( Table 4 ) . Visual inspection of the logit parameters produced by the estimation sample and by the verification sample shows they are very similar . Furthermore , none of the parameters are significantly different between the two samples using a t-test for the difference between two logits . <p> The accuracy of these variables to predict need for social services was assessed using two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service was predicted using the three predictors . The ability of the model to reduce error in predicting the distribution of cases compared with random prediction was then examined . The second procedure predicted whether each individual case needed or did not need social services and the percent of cases correctly predicted was then computed . <p> In the first procedure using the estimation sample , the logistic regression reduced the error in predicting the distribution by 78 percent . In the verification sample the error in predicting the distribution was reduced by 84 percent . Reduction in error in prediction of the distribution was calculated by comparing the maximum possible value of chi-square for the distribution with the chi-square for the predicted distribution . The proportion of chi-square reduced by the prediction can be interpreted as a percent of variance explained by the prediction equation . <p> The second method of assessing accuracy predicted need for social work services by using the logistic regression equation and examining the percent of cases correctly predicted as needing or not needing social services . The accuracy in predicting which cases would need social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total cases were correctly predicted . Of those patients who actually needed social services , 68 percent were correctly predicted . Thirty-two percent were predicted as not needing social services when they needed it ( false-negatives ) . Of those patients who did not need social services , 74 percent were correctly predicted . Twenty-six percent were predicted as needing social services but did not ( false-positives ) . INTERPRETATION OF FINDINGS <p> It is essential that early assessments be made of patients requiring discharge planning if social workers are to have sufficient time to access available and appropriate social health resources and to help establish a support network that will address the patient 's specific posthospital recovery needs . The intent of a social work screening mechanism is to identify high-risk patients as early as possible so they may be referred to social workers for assessment . This study focused specifically on whether the factors assessed by nurses using the NPAQ system and data available through the hospital 's Master Data Base could be used as valid predictors of elder cardiac patients who are in need of hospital social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used were those recorded on day three after hospital admission . Because of the need for as early an assessment and intervention as possible , the data from day three were considered the optimum time to identify factors that would be predictive of elder cardiac patients at high risk . <p> The NPAQ system is used by the nursing services of many hospitals to measure and attain an acuity rating of the patient 's nursing care requirements . These scores are a means to assess differential staff needs for nursing across services . Using the physiological and functional data on the NPAQ system to identify elder cardiac patients at high risk for need of social work services is potentially an efficient and cost-effective approach to screening in hospitals . <p> Three predictors were identified : mobility on day three , patient type on day three , and prior admission status . These factors are primarily physiological and functional indications of how frail the patient is . These three major indicators are perceived as markers related to the **26;0;TOOLONG needs that social workers are professionally trained to address in discharge planning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of 26 percent , a significant decrease over the 65 percent false positives occurring in the current screening approach . <p> Mobility level was the strongest predictor in differentiating those elder cardiac patients in need or not in need of hospital social services . The more mobile the elder patient on day three , the less likely that patient was to require help . Elder patients with good mobility are not likely to have difficulties in performing normal Activities of Daily Living ( ADLs ) . Thus they are less likely to require institutional care or home health care assistance in following complex posthospital health care treatment . Mobility would obviously enhance an elder patient 's ability to return to normal activities after hospital discharge and reduce the need for complex social work planning . <p> Patient type ( based on acuity rating ) on day three was another significant predictive factor in differentiating those elder cardiac patients in need of hospital social work services . Social work patients were sicker and more functionally disabled , thus requiring more nursing care , than patients not seen by social workers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or exacerbate , cognitive and psychological impairment and , in turn , impede posthospital recovery . These patients and their families are more likely to require professional support services or home health supports during posthospitalization recovery . These patients are also at greater risk for institutionalization after hospital discharge . <p> One or more prior admissions was also a significant predictive factor in differentiating patients in need of social services . Elderly patients are more prone to chronic functional disability and are at high risk for readmission , due to severity of illness , age , and the impact of social and psychological stressors . Because of the current trend toward shorter hospital stays , elder patients may return home sicker and more frail , leading to early readmission for the same disease or similar problems . Stressful life events after hospital discharge can interfere with an elder cardiac patient 's ability to recover . Experiencing a further loss or trauma after returning home can lead to an increase of the patient 's chance of hospital readmission . The mental and coping capabilities of the patient and family can affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Berkman &; Abrams , 1986 ) . Furthermore , elder cardiac patients may experience a decline in mental functioning during the readmission and may become confused and disoriented , which can interfere with their ability to recover from medical illness . It is logical , therefore , that elder cardiac patients who experience social and psychological problems in adjusting to life changes and experience problems in following posthospital health care treatment , as well as those who experience anxiety and confusion upon readmission , are identified for social work service . IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE <p> The study revealed that the most significant predictors of need for social services were previous admissions , impeded free movement on day three , and a more acute day three patient type . Commonly , it is on the third day after admission that elder cardiac patients are medically stable enough for initial assessment of posthospital care needs . By using the NPAQ system ( revised to include prior admission status ) as a screening mechanism for identification of patients in need of social services , social workers could receive a daily computerized list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not preclude clients being identified via the traditional generators of referrals ( such as social service rounds , nurse , doctor , patient , family ) , and it is these sources that could identify the patients not detected by the NPAQ screening method . <p> Use of the NPAQ system as a method for identifying elder cardiac patients in need of social work services would prove beneficial to patients and their families , to social workers , and to hospital administrators . The NPAQ system can provide early and accurate identification of most elder cardiac patients who require social work services , reducing the present time-consuming and inefficient method of patient selection . This can enhance social worker efficiency in developing and implementing an adequate posthospital care plan that can thwart premature readmissions and enhance patient recovery . Thus , social workers can contribute to cost containment efforts while still maintaining their professional standards of service and improving patient care . <p> It has been established that there is an interplay between the physiological , psychological , and social-environmental factors that indicate need for social work services around posthospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of which are of a functional nature , serve as predictors for social service need . Further research that would attempt to study the accuracy of the NPAQ tool to identify patients with other diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular accidents , for example , could serve to address whether or not NPAQ data can be used as a screening tool for other populations as well . Replication of this study in other acute care facilities that use the NPAQ system should also be undertaken . It is hoped that improved screening will enable social workers to provide more effective and efficient discharge planning services to patients and families and also contribute to decreased hospital costs . The screening techniques that are used to identify patients can be a significant part of effective discharge planning in the 1990s . <p> 1 The sign of the logit indicates whether a predictor increases or decreases the odds of a person not receiving social services .
