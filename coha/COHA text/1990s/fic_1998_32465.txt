Memphis , year five of the reign of the pharaoh Tutankhamun His wife had always hated the night , for demons and lost spirits of the dead roamed in the darkness , but Bakht had always liked it . Night was the time of coolness , when Ra 's solar bark vanished into the underworld . Besides , he 'd never met a demon or disgruntled dead one while on guard duty in his many years as a royal soldier . Bakht hefted his spear on his shoulder and paced slowly beside the perimeter wall of the royal menagerie . Beyond that wall and behind several others , far higher , lay the royal palace . Inside , surrounded by his most trusted bodyguards , the young king slept . He would need his rest , for the feast of Opet approached , a time of ceremony and celebration that would take pharaoh to Thebes . Bakht was looking forward to the days of feasting and merriment . His special place as a favored guard of pharaoh allowed him to be one of those to escort the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the packed earth , kicking aside pebbles . Bakht sniffed a pungent vegetable odor and stepped aside to avoid a dung pile . He glanced across the menagerie , a vast area filled with cages , biers , pens , and stalls and sheltered by palms , sycamores , and acacias . Accompanied by the rhythmic snarls of a male lion , Bakht walked by a giraffe pen . Far away from the peaceful animals lay the heavily reinforced domain of the predatorsnot just the lions but cheetahs , leopards , and Syrian bears . Bakht heard his name called and turned to see the new guard , Khawi , approach . Khawi was young and in awe of his new responsibilities , and even more confoundedby Bakht 's position as the oldest regularly serving soldier at the palace . Ever since he 'd learned that pharaoh often sent for Bakht to hear stories of expeditions to Nubia , raids against Libyan bandits , and other tales , Khawi had treated Bakht with the reverence due a great one . Bakht tried not to grin as Khawi marched toward him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young one . " " And upon you , Guard Bakht . " Khawi dipped his head and saluted at the same time . " Admit it , young one . You thought this old man would forget to relieve you . " Khawi 's eyes widened , and he shook his head vigorously . " Oh , no , Guard Bakht . Never would I think such a disrespectful thing . " Bakht took pity on the boy , who was no more than sixteen and far too naive for his own welfare . " Walk with me awhile , young Khawi . Someone 's got to rid you of this habit of puppylike trust . It 's a bad trait for a soldier , especially a royal guard . " As Khawi fell in step with him , Bakht swept his arm around to indicate the menagerie , the pleasure gardens , the palace itself . " If you want to be like me and serve under many pharaohsmay they live foreverthen you listen to me . " " They say you have served since the time of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awe . Bakht snorted , disturbing the rest of a red junglefowl . " Donkey-witted , that 's what you are . I was n't born until year nine of the Magnificent . But those were days of glorious happenings . I traveled into Nubia to serve the viceroy , and we crushed a mighty gathering of rebel tribes . " " Nubia , " Khawi breathed . " Is it truly a savage and dangerous land ? " " Some of it . " Whipping around to face Bakht , Khawi gripped his spear in a stranglehold and danced from one foot to the other . " Tell me about the golden ones , Bakht . Tell me about the kings . " They had reached the ostrich pens . Pretending reluctance , Bakht rested his spear against a fence and spread his arms wide , stretching muscles that had grown slack with age . " Please , " Khawi said . " I suppose I can spare a few moments , " Bakht said as he leaned against the fence . " Of course , the Magnificent was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gates of the Theban temples , and statues . " Bakht pointed at the sky . " Great figures of himself as high as that star . Cunning as a crocodile , was the Magnificent . Chose the most brilliant ministers , the wisest and most beautiful of wives . " " The great royal wife Tiye . " " Ah , she was clever , was Queen Tiye . Played those cursed foreign kings against each other , kept them distrusting one another . " " Why ? " " So they did n't make trouble for Egypt , boy . " " But they did make trouble , " Khawi insisted with the stubborn lack of tact of the young . " My father said that Pharaoh Akhenaten " " Shhhhh ! " Bakht hissed and clapped the young soldier on the side of his head . " I was right . You have the wits of a donkey and the flapping tongue of a green monkey . Be off with you , and try to cultivate a clever heart before you get yourself into trouble . " Babbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate open and shut behind the boy as he resumed his rounds . His many years and his experience allowed him to take a familiar view of the family of living gods whom he served , but such an attitude was improper in a youth . Muttering to himself of the carelessness of young ones today , Bakht trudged by the thick mud-brick walls of the rhinoceros enclosure without making his usual stop to admire the beasts . He would not allow the flapping tongue of Khawi to disturb his tranquillity . After all , he had survived three pharaohsthe Magnificent , the heretic Akhenaten , and poor Smenkhare , who had barely ruled before dying and leaving the throne to his brother Tutankhamun , may he have life , health , and prosperity . Yes , he had survived , and prospered too , through serving the living gods of Egypt . And of those he 'd served , the Magnificent had been the most interesting . He 'd been the embodiment of the grandeur of Egypt . The Magnificent had been the first to advance Bakht , rewarding him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nubian expedition . The Magnificent 's eldest son , Thutmose , had been as gracious as his father . A pity he 'd died . And of all his royal masters , Tutankhamunlife , health , prosperitywas the most charming . The golden one was full of curiosity about foreign lands and loved to send for Bakht and listen to tales of Kush , Libya , and cities like Byblos and Ugarit . Now that he thought about it , of all the sons of the Magnificent , Thutmose had been the most tragic , and Akhenaten the most irritating and dangerous . Bakht could never reflect upon his service in the heretic 's city without relief that he had lived to look back upon it . Had he not earned a stipend and a prosperous farm from his work in Horizon of the Aten , he would have left royal service . Even guarding the great royal wives had n't made up for enduring the great heresy . Sometimes Bakht thought of Akhenaten 's reign as an evil dreamthe time when pharaoh cast out all the ancient gods of Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sun . Certainly at the last he must have been possessed by a netherworld demon to have done what he did then . Bakht rounded the corner of a pen containing hartebeests and rumbled to himself , " He 's dead . Forget about him . Even his city is almost deserted . " Yes , the heretic was gone , and he could look back with pride at his many honors . Not the least of them was having served the most fascinating and clever of women , the royal wives . Of these , he had felt sorry for the foreigners , the Mitannian and Babylonian princesses sent to Egypt to seal alliances with pharaoh 's fellow monarchs . They arrived full of their own consequence , proud of their blood and heritage , only to be met with Egyptian ignorance and sublime lack of interest in the greatness of other peoples . He had seen the great cities and temples of Babylonia and Assyria and thus could understand why these women felt equal to any Egyptian . The foreign women were taken into pharaoh 's household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after a while they seemed to forget their homes . Perhaps it was the greater freedom they found in Egypt that seduced them at last . Bakht often wondered at the lives of such exotic creatures as Babylonian princesses . Such beings were as far from him as the lives of the creatures in the menagerie . Thinking about such mysteries relieved the boredom of standing guard over things no one with any sense would steal . What would a thief do with a giraffe in Memphis ? It was n't as if he could hide the animal . However , he would be entertained tonight , for tonight he was meeting an old friend near the baboon pit . Bakht disliked the hairy , barking creatures with the doglike snouts and always hurried past their enclosure . Ugly animals . They had hands like the hands of a man , and eyes that seemed to look into his heart and understand his nature . With reluctance , Bakht directed his steps toward the baboons . The creatures lived in an area bounded by a steep wall . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found that crowding them resulted in nasty fights . Arriving at the foot of the steps that led to the top of the enclosure wall , Bakht looked around for his friend to no avail . Sighing , he used his spear as a walking stick , trudged to the top of the stairs , and sat down on the small landing . He could see groups of dark , huddled shapes , dozens of sleeping baboons . Most of them were females and babies , brown with naked red faces and bottoms . Drab little things , they were , and the males were worse . The males had silvery gray capes of fur around their shoulders that made them look larger than they were . Nevertheless , the males possessed vicious canine teeth capable of tearing a man apart . Bakht did n't believe the overseer , who maintained that even the most aggressive baboon would n't attack a man unless there was no other choice . What did it matter if baboons announced Ra with their cries and dances when he was born again in the eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had low foreheads , tiny mad eyes , and dog snouts that made them look as though they wanted to rip his throat with their fangs . Glancing uneasily at the baboons , Bakht noticed that several big males had awakened and were moving toward him in the moonlight . He was glad the wall was steep , for they were excellent climbers . Still , he regretted his impulse to sit here in full view of them . Baboons might be sacred to the god Toth , lord of the moon and inventor of writing , but Bakht preferred to keep clear of them . He peered into the darkness and spotted a male crouched nearby . The animal was looking at him . Suddenly the baboon started , gave a strangely human cry , and pulled back his lips to bare yellow teeth the size of Bakht 's finger . Alarmed , Bakht stood , but the male was n't looking at him anymore . Bakht turned and sighed as he recognized his friend coming up the staircase . " Greetings . I was beginning to think you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in response , and Bakht stood back on the landing to allow room for the other man to join him . As he came closer , Bakht noticed the hand that had lifted in greeting had n't been lowered . There was something in it . Frowning , he said , " What are you " He got no further , for his friend reached the landing , and the hand struck . The blow jolted the air from his body . He dropped his spear and grabbed his stomach when the pain hitsearing floods of agony , as though the baboon had sunk his fangs into Bakht 's flesh . Hot liquid poured forth between Bakht 's hands . Feeling foolish , he looked down at the blood flowing over his fingers , then up at his friend in time to see the dagger this time . It hurtled at him , sinking into his chest . Bakht 's feeble attempt to ward off the blow cost him his precarious balance . When he stumbled to one knee , a blow to the side of his head sent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silver-caped baboon . Stunned , Bakht barely heard the screams of the creature . He sucked in air and tried to stand , only to fall on his face . With one hand gripping his belly , Bakht pushed himself up to rest on one elbow . He opened his mouth to scream back at the baboon . The noise that came from his throat was a feeble whisper compared to the chorus of shrieks that assaulted him . More and more males joined the silver-caped one , and behind them came the females . In terror , growing weak and dizzy , Bakht thrashed about on the ground , trying to get away . As he moved , he grabbed pebbles , sticks , anything he could use as a weapon , to hurl at his attackers . At last his back hit the enclosure wall . Bakht threw a rock at a furious mass of fur as it scampered at him . It screeched and retreated . Summoning the last of his strength , Bakht cried out , knowing all the time that he would never be heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was growing heavy . With one hand still pressed to the hole in his belly , his free hand scraped the packed earth , scooping up dirt . As blackness overcame him , he hurled the dirt in the snarling dog-face of the baboon that rushed at him .
