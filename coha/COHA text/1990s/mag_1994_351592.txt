She was buried in Roselawn , Indiana , last Monday morning , with three crucifixes pinned to her pink dress and a favorite rattle bracelet lacing her wrist . At the flower-strewn gravesite , her small white casket was placed beside that of her sister , who was laid to rest 10 months earlier . <P> To most people it seemed the sad but certain end to the saga of the Lakeberg Siamese twins . Born joined at the chest with a fused liver and shared heart , they were separated last August at seven weeks of age in a controversial procedure that sacrificed one sister , Amy , so that the other , Angela , might live . The chance of success  --  widely reported to be just 1%  --  and the projected $1 million bill for the infants ' care ignited a national debate over the limits of medical intervention . Now the Lakeberg girls lay reunited in death . A tragedy , surely , but not a surprise . <P> And yet to the people who knew best  --  her family , doctors and nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanticipated . In fact , says Dr. Russell Raphaely , director of critical care at Philadelphia 's Children 's Hospital , until her final respiratory illness , he would have estimated " a better than 95% chance " that she would leave the hospital a healthy child . Says Angela 's mother Joey , 25 : " We thought she would be home this summer . " Far from the tortured existence that many predicted , Angela 's brief life was largely free of suffering . Repairs to her heart had rendered it fully functional . Her chest was somewhat misshapen but healing well . Angela did not spend her days entangled in tubes and wires . She needed no sedatives or painkillers or emergency trips to the operating room . <P> Ensconced in the hospital 's cardiothoracic intensive-care unit , the infant recovered quickly from the 5 1/2-hour operation that separated her from her twin . One week later doctors removed the breathing tube that connected her to a respirator . But since her lungs were still weak from surgery and congenital problems , they placed her in a negative-pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enclosing the body from the neck down in a vacuum , so that air flows through the nose and mouth and into the lungs without the effort of inhalation . Over the next months , Angela 's caretakers began the process of weaning her from the machine . But in the meantime she was fed her baby formula through a thin nasogastric tube so as not to interfere with her breathing . <P> By late fall she was able to leave the ventilator for short periods to be held and rocked by nurses . Therapists manipulated her mouth to try to teach her the motions of sucking and eating , and eventually began feeding her tiny ! amounts of pureed food . They played grabbing and reaching games to help her learn to sit up . In January doctors discovered an obstruction in a pulmonary artery and inserted a small tube to widen the passage . <P> Joey Lakeberg made half a dozen trips to Philadelphia to see her red-haired , blue-eyed daughter , but financial constraints and marital problems kept her in Indiana much of the time . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time holding Angela , blowing her kisses and trying to teach her to wink . Angela 's father Kenny saw his child only twice .
