<p> Neil Patrick Harris ' mother has just slipped him a college application to NYU . <p> " I want to go , " says television 's Doogie Howser , M.D. , the child prodigy whose weekly tightrope walks through the worlds of medicine and adolescence are a growing ratings tonic for second-place ABC . <p> " I think that college is very important , " says 17-year-old Harris , a high school senior and A student , though no genius like Doogie . " It is rewarding , not only educationally , but also socially . " <p> The truth is that Harris has decided to delay college at least until Doogie Howser ends - and that 's at least three years away . But he talks about the importance of higher education from a perspective that is decidedly grown- up . <p> Acting adult is just what Harris does . As the star of producer Steven Bochco 's quirky Doogie Howser , ( tonight , 9 EST/PST ) , which in its second season has become a solid top-20 hit , the teen-ager has had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Series creator Bochco says he knew Harris was his Doogie the first time they met . He says the similarities between Doogie , who works as a resident in a hospital , and Neil , who works as the star of a TV series , are striking . <p> " He has an uneasy leg in two different worlds , " says Bochco . " One leg is in the highly skilled professional world in which he is inordinately successful and the other is firmly planted in being a 17-year-old kid . " <p> Harris says his job obligates him to maintain an " adult stature . " Playing Doogie , " you ca n't lose your cool . " <p> " It 's a big burden , " says Max Casella , 23 , who plays Doogie 's best buddy , Vinnie . " He 's responsible for about 40 jobs . How else is he going to behave ? " <p> Actually , Harris downplays the challenge . He says he 's always been mature for his age . <p> " When I 'm with my friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . I do n't put on that front that a lot of kids put on : ' Hello , Mrs. Johnson , it 's a pleasure to meet you . ' I just go , ' Hey , how 're you doing ? ' <p> " I 'm very open ... little kids are attracted to me because I 'm like a magnet . I like magic and juggling . I 'm like the baby sitter you always wanted to have . " <p> Harris grew up in Ruidoso , N.M. , a tourist town three hours south of Albuquerque . He got interested in acting in school , signing up for a weeklong drama camp at New Mexico State University . There , at age 14 , he met playwright Mark Medoff ( Children of a Lesser God ) , who was working on a film script for Clara 's Heart . <p> Medoff sent a videotape of Harris to Warner Bros. and he was cast opposite Whoopi Goldberg in the 1988 release . The film was a flop , but Harris got good notices . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entertainer , " says his mother , Sheila , a lawyer . " But I am surprised it happened so soon . " <p> The experience was overwhelming for the family , which also includes Harris ' father , Ray , also a lawyer , and brother Brian , 20 , a college journalism student . <p> Before Clara 's Heart , a talent search had come to town , and Harris competed as a singer . But it turned out to be a scam , " some guy who goes from town to town and takes your money and runs . " <p> Burned by that , the family was skeptical about Clara 's Heart . Though it turned out to be a good experience , they remain careful about the entertainment business , even after Harris did roles in TV movies ( Cold Sassy Tree with Faye Dunaway ) and then won the part of Doogie Howser in 1989 . <p> The family had just moved to Albuquerque . Separated when Harris ' mother went to law school , they decided to move to Los Angeles rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albuquerque when he 's not working and Harris will graduate from high school there in June . <p> Bochco says he warned Harris ' parents that Doogie was going to make their son a star and " you 're not going to be prepared for it . " They were not and neither was Harris , who is having a hard time settling into his celebrity . <p> He does press interviews reluctantly and is fearful that fan magazines will try to make him a teen idol . He guards his personal life , squirming when talk turns to whom he is dating - " I date like anyone else on the weekends . " <p> Says Bochco , " We were talking about doing some merchandising , and he called me . He had some concerns about it . It 's tough enough being recognized . He did n't want to walk into a store and see a Doogie section with his face on lunch boxes . I said let 's not do it . " <p> Harris got roughed up by the tabloids recently when one reported that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-star Casella was leading him down what Harris jokingly describes as " the path to hell . " <p> The two actors , who are not really pals off the set because one is 17 and the other 23 ( " That 's a big age gap , " says Casella ) , say they have no idea where that came from . <p> More often , there have been odd reports that Harris , because he plays a doctor , has actually saved a life somehow . That 's never happened , either . <p> " One night after the Jerry Lewis telethon , I was driving and I saw a car accident . An older man hit a lady . No one stopped . They could care less . So I stopped . " <p> The woman was not hurt , but the man , whose car did a 360-degree spin , was " very shaky , " says Harris . " I calmed him down . Nobody was really hurt . They were all laughing because I was like a doctor on the scene . " <p> More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid , though few have seen him act like a kid in public . Bochco says he 's never seen it . His mother says Neil 's older brother was the renegade of the two . Neil " likes to please people , " she says . <p> Recent night outs for Harris have been to go bowling and to go to a dinner at a Hollywood restaurant where a murder is acted out . He is more anxious to see Home Alone than Dances With Wolves . Besides magic and juggling , his big interest is collecting Disney paraphernalia . <p> He drives a 1986 Ford Escort , which his parents bought for him . But he 'll probably buy a new car for graduation . His dream : a Mustang convertible . Though Doogie is making Harris wealthy , he lives on an allowance and each season gets a major present for himself . Last year it was a car stereo . Everything else goes to a trust fund . <p> " I 'm starting to get out on my own more , " he says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my parents forever . At the same time , I do n't want them to feel useless . They need to go back and do their thing . " <p> The issue of when he will get a place of his own is not resolved . He may split when he turns 18 in June or may decide to stay with his parents for another year . <p> Doogie 's alter ego is growing up . He says he 's serious about college . He plans to be a theater arts major with a film minor . " I do n't think I 'll lose that urge , " he says . <p> Harris says he has been very mature right from the start when it comes to the sexual frankness that is a signature of all Bochco TV series . The first show when he had to kiss girlfriend Wanda Plenn ( Lisa Dean Ryan ) was " pretty bad , " but they 're getting good at it by now . The two actors had crushes on each other when the series began , and are now good friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examinations included - he 's never been embarrassed : " My visions are much worse than the show 's could ever be . " CUTLINE : SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE : ' Doogie Howser , M.D. ' star Neil Patrick Harris , left , and series producer Steven Bochco have steered the ABC sitcom into prime-time 's top 20 in its second season .
