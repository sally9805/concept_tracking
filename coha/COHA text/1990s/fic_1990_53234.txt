JUST BEFORE SHE DIED , Hal Lieberman 's wife said , " You can fool around with other women . I wo n't be jealous . Be good to them . You know women are always complaining about men . " The day before she 'd pointed out a headline , an actress claiming : " He treated me like a disposable diaper . " She said , " I want you to do something for the masculine image . Make women happy . You might start by brushing up on your cooking , learning more about wines . " <p> Hal was crying and could only say , " But I want you . " He and Bonnie had been married since they were both twenty-two , for fourteen years , and she was the only woman with whom he 'd ever made love . Now was the time to speak of their devotion to one another , and her casual attitude distressed him . Whenever they 'd parted for solo visits to family and friends , she tried to pick a fight with him hours before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bonnie yawned , waved to the two of them reflected in the ceiling 's mirror ( her idea ) , closed her eyes , and fell asleep for the last time . Next to her Hal wept , disregarding the postmortem signs . Then he dreamed , and she was alive again , but the breasts he cupped in his sleep were stony . <p> After Bonnie died , Hal found a necklace he 'd given her . When they were college students in Bloomington in the early seventies , he 'd created the necklace from bite-size , tubular white fossils he 'd collected as a boy on nature walks through the Indiana countryside . She 'd dutifully worn the necklace a few times , then said she loved him but not it . <p> As Hal drooped in an old corduroy chair , fingering the fossils , he imagined Bonnie 's bones crumbling and becoming like those he held in his hand , but her bones would n't be white , they 'd be grey-pink , ashes of roses . He saw his brain as being composed of similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still alive . <p> He and Bonnie had met when he 'd answered her ad : " Garage Band Genius Needed . " They both played guitar and she sang . He was attracted to her partly because she was large and good-looking  --  tall , sharp-nosed , big-breasted , with long , fluffy hair  --  and partly because , as her mother had told her , Bonnie had a way of saying what was better left unsaid , a quality which had its charm . At first Hal was remarkably inexperienced , either sticking his tongue down her throat or primly keeping his mouth closed and dry . But he learned . She said she liked his peacefulness , the way he delighted in the simpler pleasures , and his deft hands . <p> After college , they hitchhiked to New York City and enjoyed moderate success in the folk music scene for almost a year before they went out of fashion . They continued to eke out a living playing cover music at weddings , office parties , bar mitzvahs . After ten years in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exchange for superintendent duties , they lived rent-free and were relatively wealthy . Rather than disturbing them , the lack of sunlight proved an aphrodisiac . <p> Hal and Bonnie composed their own music and practiced every day though they never performed original tunes anymore . They attended concerts : folk , classical , rock . They danced around their apartment . When the weather permitted , they hung out on the grounds of the Cloisters . If they did n't have to work , they sampled a different restaurant every Friday night , a movie Saturday night . They read the same books and newspapers and discussed them . At their Citizens Against Nuclear Energy group , they met a couple with whom they socialized . After their friends moved to California , Hal and Bonnie agreed they must branch out a little . A reason to put it off always arose , as did a reason to put off having a baby . <p> Bonnie had been jogging when the taxi struck her . A witness told Hal how passersby dragged her from the street to the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd shouted , " I 'll call an ambulance ! " Fifteen minutes passed before the members of the pack surrounding Bonnie realized the volunteer caller had disappeared . An hour after the accident , a doctor finally examined her . <p> She was paralyzed from the waist down and , as the result of nerve malfunction , she had a permanent splitting headache . The doctor said the accident probably caused some sort of brain damage as well , the magnitude of which would take time to determine . <p> Back at home , Bonnie tried to smile as she described the headache to Hal as " a little man with sharp ice skates figure-skating around my brain and humming loudly off-key . " Her head hurt so much she had to squeeze Hal 's fingers until the throbbing subsided , just as she 'd clutched him when they used to make love . Hal also imagined she 'd have grabbed his hand that way if she were giving birth . <p> Before the accident she 'd only cry about indirect sadnesses , like the story she 'd heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a shopping mall and died because it could n't digest flour . After the accident she cried often . <p> Her voice changed , lost its richness . Sleeping and eating became less and less frequent . Painkillers , she said , made her feel like a zombie . A couple of times Hal and Bonnie took a taxi to a pain support group , but the ride made her nauseous and they spent most of the time in the bathroom . " This is n't living , " she said . <p> For weeks they fought about whether she was or was n't really living . One night she cried for hours , chanting , " I ca n't stand it . I ca n't stand it , " and Hal could only watch and smooth back her damp hair . <p> At last , exhausted , Hal said , " I do n't know what 's what anymore , Bonnie . " <p> Carefully they planned her death . She wrote a suicide note . They said their good-byes , pretending they 'd see each other again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with champagne , Hal was at the dentist so he 'd have an alibi and would n't be implicated . <p> As the dentist , drill in hand , loomed over him , Hal wondered which moment was the one Bonnie ceased to be alive . In a laughing gas haze , he struggled to get up from the dental chair in which he was reclining to rush home and stop her , but though his mind told his limbs to move , they stayed put . <p> Hal arrived home , his mouth numb and bloody from the dental work and his chewing the lining of his cheeks . In the bedroom , Bonnie sat up , her eyes open . She winked , and the shock caused him to scream . Catching his wrist , she pulled him down beside her . " Do n't worry , " she said . " It 's me . " Then she told him her feelings about other women . <p> After a dreary funeral in Bonnie 's Indiana hometown , Hal devoted a few weeks to dreaming , waiting for Bonnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed to facilitate sleep . In his dreams he was with Bonnie and she gave him a makeover . Without the aid of scissors or a razor , she cut his hair and shaved his beard simply by touching the hair she wanted removed . She placed a finger on his spare tire , the hint of a double chin , and the unnecessary inches vanished . " Make love to me , " he said . " Do n't make me over . " <p> She stretched out , and she was wearing the flattering red dress in which she often performed . She sang , " Do n't Make Me Over , " one of the cover songs they used to play . Though her voice sounded like the warm , piercing voice of old , he became mad at her , and it repelled him , making him curl into a tight ball . <p> He awoke when he got a call from a tenant whose toilet had overflowed . " I hate you , " he said to the receiver after he 'd placed it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ability to see the good in everyone ; maybe with the makeover Bonnie had equipped him with a new , eighties-type , shrewd , competitive personality . With that thought , he returned to bed . He remembered the two of them , a couple of years before , cleaning out a closet and laughing when they uncovered an almost forgotten pair of bell-bottoms with a peace sign motif . <p> Most of Bonnie 's life insurance went for medical bills and to pay for the credit cards they 'd abused after playing music became impossible . When Hal started worrying about money again , he called the booking agent who 'd arranged most of his and Bonnie 's engagements . Before the accident , throughout the nine years they 'd done business , Hal had never canceled nor been late for an appointment . The agent felt sorry for him and moved him up a few steps by forcing him on a jazz duo , two elderly men  --  one a pianist , one a saxophonist  --  who played for choice parties and for a jazz club on Tuesdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The guy 's wife just croaked . Have a heart . " The agent told Hal , " They were looking for a guitarist . Young blood . Relatively , that is . " <p> The afternoon Hal was to rehearse for the first time with " The Dynamic Duo , " five minutes before he had to leave , he realized he 'd neglected the laundry for weeks . Every garment had a food stain , was torn or too wrinkled to wear . He pictured two men , twins , roly-poly and fastidious like his father , clucking at his jeans , though fortunately the weeks of dirt blended into the fabric . He considered an androgynous sweater of Bonnie 's but vetoed it when he tried it on and it clung to his chest and back as if it were a snake , squeezing him . The sweater got caught on his head and ripped in his hurry to remove it . He threw himself on the carpeted floor , which was n't as soft as it looked , and decided to just stay in exactly that position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he 'd broken his promise to himself , he stood up . He put on a white button-down with a prunelike texture and ran to the subway . On the train and panting , he discovered the pen in his shirt pocket was leaking . <p> The Dynamic Duo , William and Francis , did cluck at him and did look alike , though nothing like his father . They were more like the older , distinguished type of male model : tall , muscular , high cheekbones , full heads of white hair , and perfectly starched and sparkling white shirts . They had a rehearsal studio in their elegant navy and cream East Side apartment . While Hal was tuning , he lifted his head and caught William and Francis exchanging skeptical glances . <p> Hal smiled , was polite , asked them about themselves , and he played well , enriching their instruments . <p> After the third rehearsal , William , who was the talker , said , " Look . You 're all right . It 's been fun . But when we perform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look spiffy Thursday . " <p> Hal nodded . " I know . You two look great and I 'm a slob . It 's true . I used to be better . A little better . " <p> Francis patted him on the back . William shook his hand and said , " We understand . Stop here at four on Thursday . We 'll make sure you 're shipshape . " <p> As he waved good-bye at the threshold , he sucked in his cheeks , thrust out his chest , flashed bedroom eyes and arched eyebrows at them . They laughed . In the empty elevator , Hal slumped and thought if he were a woman , whatever age , and had to decide who was sexiest  --  William , Francis , or himself  --  he would choose William , then Francis . He silently addressed Bonnie . AlI right . I 'm going to make myself beautiful . God 's gift to womankind . I will try to be better . <p> Back in the armchair , he indulged himself in one last pitcher of bourbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Before his first performance that Thursday with the Dynamic Duo ( soon to be known as the WFH Trio ) , Hal got a short , slick haircut . While waiting for his stylist , he studied GQ . The stylist hinted that if Hal persisted in using low-quality products on his hair he risked going bald , so Hal bought expensive shampoo , conditioner , and hair gel . " For body , " the stylist said . <p> Hal opened an account at Macy 's and let loose , purchasing skin creams , cologne , a fancy razor , a digital scale , two pairs of linen trousers , two oxford cloth shirts , a designer tie , soft black leather wingtips , and a pair of scarlet boxer shorts which were on sale . <p> Pressed against his bathroom sink , he shaved off his beard . For the first time in fifteen years he saw his chin , and it was in better shape than he 'd feared . In the mornings , singing along to Peter , Paul &; Mary , and Joan Armatrading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apartment , circling the living room , down the hall , in place . He ate tofu and brown rice , crudites , thick , unsliced whole grain bread which he tore off in chunks , and he drank only club soda . At first he put salt or sugar on the tofu to give it more zip , but he was able to stomach it straight after a couple of days . <p> He cleaned the apartment and cast a critical eye on it . His home needed some other life form , something low maintenance , and he 'd always had a black thumb , so be bought a tank and four plump angelfish . He ran his hand against the glass as if petting them . The glow of the tank served as a night-light . <p> That Thursday William said , " Who is this stranger ? Look at you . " As he ushered Hal in , he yelled , " Francis , come quick . Hal 's a stud . " <p> The party celebrated an art gallery 's tenth anniversary . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in huge rented rooms which could have belonged to high schools , with lots of fake wood , green carnations , and baby-blue daisies . <p> The gallery 's tinted glass doors shed the only outside light on the long rectangle with gray marble floors . Three large sculptures had been placed equidistant from one another ; the walls , where not decorated with art , were white lacquer ; the only furniture was a receptionist 's glossy , high-tech desk upon which sat a Japanese floral arrangement with enormous , animal-like flowers . <p> Hal relaxed as the evening progressed . No one at this party would vomit on the floor or accidentally step on his foot or shout at him , " Led Zeppelin ! " The music they played required some creativity , and those attending the party seemed to appreciate it . Before , for all those years , he 'd had to pretend he was interested in the music he performed , pretend he was playing something more than automatically . His detachment from the scenes never really bothered him ; he forgot all about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was there , Bonnie was too . He and she would make eyes at each other . <p> He wondered what she 'd think if she saw him at this moment  --  he was attractive even , judging by the smiles women bestowed upon him , particularly one woman who seemed to be just facing him , waiting for his eyes to focus on her and grinning each time they did . His first possibility . But what would Bonnie think of her , of this place ? She might have said , " That 's art ? Look at those posers . " Or she might have said , " At last , some intelligent , interesting people . " She was unpredictable , though in hindsight , her surprises were unsurprising ; whatever she 'd done was Bonnie-esque . <p> During a break he tagged after William and Francis , hovering near them as they picked up glasses of wine and sampled the tapas waiters brought out from behind an unmarked , almost seamless door . <p> The smiling woman , small , dark , and handsome in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " You play so well . " <p> " Thank you very much . You 're a good audience . " <p> They introduced themselves . <p> She said , " Does n't Lieberman mean something like ' loverboy ' in German ? " <p> " I 'm not really sure . Could be . " <p> William and Francis subtly drifted away . Hal asked Robin a lot of questions about herself , discovered she was a native New Yorker , a graphic designer living in Chelsea with two cats . He liked her husky voice and the way her eyes expanded when she spoke of something she was interested in . She leaned toward him as if she were telling him secrets . He asked for her phone number , and she handed him an elegant gray card . <p> After the party the WFH Trio squeezed into a taxi . William and Francis insisted on getting the lowdown on Robin . They approved of her appearance . <p> The next morning Hal popped out of bed , sent flowers to William and Francis to thank them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robin 's answering machine , inviting her to a dinner which he would cook the following week . She returned the call later , accepted , and he had something to look forward to . That evening , however , as he inspected #1 B 's clogged drain , he worried about seeing Robin  --  maybe he should n't have called her . But , he reassured himself , pulling out a wad of hair from the pipe , this was what Bonnie wanted him to do . <p> The day Robin was coming to dinner he spent exercising , cleaning the apartment , shopping , preparing whatever food he could beforehand . He 'd been reading the wine column in Wednesday 's Times and felt he had chosen a good bottle . The hour before Robin arrived , Hal relaxed in a bubble bath . After he shaved , he stood in front of the mirror , stroking his chin . He slapped on his new aftershave , which stung like hell . In the living room , he looked at the fossil necklace on the arm of Bonnie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already told Robin he was a recent widower . <p> Robin and Hal shook hands at the door , and she gave him the chocolate torte she 'd brought for dessert and a small portfolio , since he 'd asked to see a sample of her work . He poured her a glass of wine and they picked at cheese and crackers while they leafed through her designs for magazine advertisements , printed cards for fashion designers and stores . He complimented her on her work though he had no idea what was good or bad in the graphic design world . <p> During dinner he made sure her plate and glass were always full . She had studied art , he knew about music , and they told each other about their tastes . Her personality lacked the immediate wallop of Bonnie 's , but he tried to resist comparing them . He played her some of his favorite records . As he swerved to the table bearing a tea tray to accompany dessert , she said , " What a good host you are . " She looked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she saw it or not . When their eyes next met , they both smiled , but he was unsure why . While she was in the bathroom and he was rinsing dishes , he heard the voice in his head , " Bonnie , Bonnie , Bonnie , " and he was glad Robin was out of the room and would have no chance to read his face . <p> After dinner he escorted Robin to the subway and rode with her to her stop , walked her to the door of her apartment building . They exchanged a light goodnight kiss and agreed to meet again for dinner a week later . As her small back disappeared , he wondered who had loved her , who loved her now , and he wondered how she spent her nights . <p> The jazz club William and Francis played Tuesdays turned out to be a renamed and remodeled version of a club Hal and Bonnie had played a few times in their folk heyday . The patrons were all dressed sharply , expensively . Hal now fit right in as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stomach churn at the thought of money . William and Francis seemed to have adopted him . <p> The WFH Trio parted after the gig . Hal wanted to wander around for a bit . As he walked across Fourth Street , he remembered how the neighborhood used to be when first he 'd frequented it  --  not so many rich-looking types and venues , but neither had there been so many street people propped against the buildings . One of the men lying on the sidewalk caught Hal looking at him and blew him a kiss . The man reminded Hal of himself during the week after Bonnie died : the same scraggly beard , gelatinous complexion . <p> Three skinheads with swastikas emblazoned on their jackets strode toward him , forcing Hal to the curb . When his shoulder brushed that of the young man on the outside , the young man grabbed Hal 's sleeve and said , " Got a problem , you old fart ? " He shoved Hal away , laughed , and kept walking . Hal just pretended nothing unusual had occurred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , hit back if they touched her . Though Hal had never committed an act of physical violence , he had an urge to run back and kick the guy in the balls . He heard one of the skinheads say , " Stupid faggot . " Hal 's satisfaction with the evening 's performance dissolved ; out on the sidewalk , the law seemed to be survival of the fittest , no points for good guitar-playing . <p> Robin suggested they meet next at a place in her neighborhood called " Mean Cuisine . " She was seated at a booth when he kissed her hello . " What kind of perfume are you wearing ? It 's lovely , " he said . <p> She raised her eyebrows . " I think it 's yours . I 'm not wearing any . " <p> She pulled him toward her and sniffed his neck . " Yes , it 's you , " she said . <p> He sat down . <p> " Yummy , " she said , her face bright . <p> He did n't know whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he was too shy to ask and just gave her a neutral smile . <p> Hal asked her to order for him and she did , pronouncing foreign words with ease . Now that Hal ate most meals alone , he 'd shed some of the niceties of dining , often forgetting silverware or table manners . Many times he stood by the refrigerator and scooped food into his mouth , tidbits slipping through his fingers . He had to make a conscious effort to return to a presentable eating style . " Be good to women , " he thought . " Make them happy . " <p> He did most of the eating and drinking while she took a bite or sip about every five minutes . He asked her if she 'd spent any time away from the city , and she told him about a trip to Europe a few years before . In Italy , in what had once been a monastery , she 'd had a twenty-one-course meal . One course consisted of a thrush drowned in brandy ; apparently , this was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was so small I had to eat the whole thing , bones and all . Then , about halfway through , I was groaning , and we all thought we might burst , and they gave us shots of this clear liqueur which revived us . We were hungry again . " <p> " What was the drink called ? " <p> " They would n't tell us . " <p> " You 're so small . I ca n't imagine you packing it all away , " Hal said . " I 'm probably the only person in this restaurant who 's never been to Europe . " They scanned the restaurant as if people 's appearances would bear a European stamp like a passport . <p> " You 'll have to go some day , " she said , then added , " I 've never been married . " <p> He was going to say she had to give it a go some day , but he did n't want to leave the impression he might be looking to marry . He wanted to be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage market . " I enjoyed it , " he said . <p> " Then you had a good marriage ? It 's rare these days to hear about one . " <p> " Yes , " he said . He knew he would be loath to listen to her talk about an old boyfriend so he decided to avoid speaking of Bonnie . He was afraid , too , that if he began talking about her , he would be unable to stop . He would still be babbling after Robin had ducked out the door , while the waiters set the chairs on top of the tables . <p> After dinner , lingering , they walked to her apartment building . Someone in the building next to Robin 's was screeching , " Screw you ! Screw you ! " Neither Hal nor Robin commented on it . <p> Hal said , " Well , good night . " <p> " Come up for a nightcap ? " she asked . <p> " Striped with a little tassel on the end ? " <p> " If you like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , less expensive version of the gallery in which they 'd met . The television was on , the volume low . Robin told him to stay put while she opened a cabinet and brought out a bottle of brandy and two glasses . " No thrush ? " he asked . When he sat on the sofa both cats draped themselves over him . Robin sat next to him , petting the cats on his lap . Under their purring he heard the food he 'd just eaten churning in his stomach . As his hand covered one of the cat 's ears , Robin 's covered his . She was quite casual , collected , when she lifted his hand and played with it . " Nice to meet you , " she said . <p> They kissed and her mouth was n't Bonnie 's but smaller , cooler , less salty . <p> When she saw his red silk boxers , she said , " Those are great . Walk around a little . " <p> His first impulse was to say , " Oh , come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robin wanted . <p> " Those are really sexy , " she said , as he strolled around her bedroom . <p> " You are really sexy , " he said . She was naked , lying down , arms folded under her head , propping it up . <p> He joined her . They gently engaged in the sexually transmitted disease and birth control discussions . <p> " Tell me how to make you happy . That 's what I want , " he said . She said nothing , just pointed to parts of herself and parts of him . She looked good  --  curvy , solid . She was the second naked woman he 'd ever touched . She felt good , smelled good , tasted good , sounded good , but his mind was playing home movies . To rid himself of Bonnie-thoughts , he pretended he was enjoying himself more than he was . Bonnie had once told him about a psychological experiment in which control group members were asked to fill out a questionnaire about the mood they were in at the moment . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental group was required to sit in a booth , faking a smile for five minutes . Those in the experimental group rated themselves as much happier than those in the control group . <p> They stayed up till dawn , rubbing and cuddling . While they were kissing again , he watched her brown eyelids , the enigmatic surface of her face . She opened her eyes and seemed ruffled to find him staring back at her . Several times he asked her , " What are you thinking ? " and she only answered , " Nothing special . " She did n't ask him the same question . Maybe all her ex-lovers were in bed with them , too . Robin fell asleep for a couple of hours . Hal dozed off , waking every half hour or so . But his dreams seemed to span days . In one dream Bonnie stood in the doorway to Robin 's bedroom , but Robin 's shoulder was in the way so he could only see Bonnie 's legs , healthy legs , not the paralyzed ones . He strained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression was one of approval or jealousy . He could n't see . <p> Robin had an appointment that morning , so they made another date , and Hal squeezed onto the subway with the rush hour crowd . Walking down his block , he stumbled over a lone sneaker he had n't seen sitting in the middle of the sidewalk . His apartment , though tidier now , still had that lived-in look , and he was glad to return . He stared at the fish . They stared back . <p> He took his guitar out of the case and strummed it half-heartedly . All their rituals , including the daily music practice , had lapsed after Bonnie 's accident . When they 'd practiced playing their own compositions , they had usually begun by giggling , flirting . After they 'd found the right rhythm , they grew more and more serious , their faces strained . He felt all hand and she seemed all voice , his hand and her voice had lives of their own , wrapping around one another , floating together . <p> Putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the boxer shorts and ran around the apartment until he collapsed on the bed in a sweaty heap . In the ceiling mirror his body was a blur , but the red shorts shone . He envisioned Bonnie intertwined with him as he 'd seen her in that mirror . He felt his face for his missing beard . <p> The WFH Trio played for a brunch at a new restaurant on Greene Street , a magazine 's anniversary , a Memorial Day party at a huge Upper West Side brownstone . They were booked for a bunch of cocktail parties and backed up a dance troupe for a week at an off-Broadway theater . <p> Robin came to see Hal play a few times . William and Francis said , " Look who 's here . " She joined the three of them for a post-performance drink and snack . Hal said little , braiding napkin strips , while Robin drew stories out of William , and even laconic Francis , finding out more personal matters and more about their backgrounds than Hal had managed to do since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealousy , but not just for his own sake . Part of him wanted to interrupt and say , " Hey , if you like Robin , you should have met Bonnie . " Another part of him was proud to be with someone as smooth as Robin , as " refined , " as his parents used to say . <p> The next rehearsal , Hal grilled William and Francis about their reaction to Robin . William said , " Great gal . We loved her . " Francis nodded . Hal knew William did n't really love Robin , but Hal himself would not have said he loved her , even in passing . Still , he did all he could to please her , to be there for her , to give her whatever she wanted . <p> She preferred they spend time at her apartment and Hal agreed . In her apartment fewer signs of Bonnie appeared . In his own apartment no signs of Robin could be found until he took home a present which she gave him one night . <p> On the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right size for a tie . He held up the gift between his thumb and index finger . He needed a few seconds to figure out that it was a black leather jockstrap . " Wow , " he said . <p> Robin was sitting next to him , bouncing . " Do you like it ? " <p> He smiled , hugged her . " Where did you get this ? " <p> " I was having a dry spell in work a while ago and I had a part-time job selling these at the lingerie version of Tupperware parties . I kept a few things I liked . " <p> " You never told me that . " <p> " You never asked . Try it on . " <p> It felt like a driving glove . She pinned him to the bed and looked very pretty as she loomed over him . Several times that week , when they were speaking on the phone , arranging to meet , she said , " And wear your present for me . " <p> At home Hal tried jogging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supportive but clammy when he perspired . He hopped up and down in front of a framed photo of Bonnie on his bureau to the sound of " See , see , " in his head . This was the first time he 'd owned a jockstrap , and he was uncomfortable wearing it . The most pleasure he received from it came on the subway when he thought , " Little do they know that I am wearing a black leather jockstrap . " The only paraphernalia he and Bonnie had ever used was the ceiling mirror . <p> Soon Robin gave him another jockstrap , blue Spandex . Then another , red sequins . Another , white velvet . " I 've never seen anything like it , " he said at each gift bestowing . To reciprocate he brought her hot-pink lilies , took her to Nirvana  --  the Indian restaurant  --  and bought her Miles Davis and Joni Mitchell CDs . <p> At home Hal stuck to a strict diet . He continued jogging , but when he contemplated moving his run out of the apartment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his music was still impossible in the apartment , so Hal depended on his twice-weekly rehearsals with William and Francis and the WFH Trio 's engagements to keep in musical shape . <p> " Would n't it be fun to go see a movie ? " Hal asked Robin as they ate take-out Chinese food . On the table Robin 's small television sat as if it were a newspaper , and a news broadcaster narrated a special documentary on Los Angeles gang wars . Hal and Robin watched , half-listening . Robin 's foot rested on Hal 's lap , and he massaged it . <p> " Loverboy , " Robin said . Her foot brushed his crotch . She stood up , took his hand , led him to the bedroom , where she touched him and kissed him . She said , " Let me draw you . " <p> " Now ? Not now . " This was the first time he 'd said " no " to anything she 'd suggested or wanted . <p> " Yes , now , " she said , stroking him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put his arms around her . <p> Naked , he lay on the bed and posed while she sat with a sketch pad on the opposite side of the room . " What are you thinking about ? " he asked . <p> " Try to look sexier , " she said . <p> " I do n't feel sexy . " <p> " What 's wrong with you ? " she said . The question was rhetorical . She bandied the pencil about for a while more , frowning . " You 're not cooperating , " she said . She dropped her sketch pad and left the room . The phone rang , and he heard her chatting in her smooth , flat voice . <p> Wrapping the quilt around himself , he fell asleep . He found Bonnie . " Use air , " she said . " What do you mean ? " he asked . He awoke and Robin , smelling like cinnamon , was spooning him , her hand over his heart . He turned to her . They kissed , made love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery where they 'd first performed together . As they set up , William studied Hal and said , " Bags under your eyes , boy .

" <p> They stared at him . <p> " I mean , she was . I do n't know what I 'm saying . I guess I am tired . " He stood by the vase of animal-like flowers , touching them . <p> William gently pulled him away from the flowers . " What about our friend Robin ? " he asked . <p> " I do n't know . " He was about to wipe his hands on his pants when Francis grabbed his hands , held them up . Pollen covered his fingers . Hal apologized . " I 'm still a slob . " <p> William ruffled Hal 's hair . As the trio played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mysterious liqueur Robin had once mentioned . <p> The following week , Hal insisted Robin come uptown for the day to visit the Cloisters , where she 'd never been . " You 're the artist , " he said . <p> " All right , all right , " she said . <p> After museums or any activity , Bonnie used to talk up a storm . Even if she had n't been touched by what they saw , she chattered on , saying , " Was that a snore or what ? " and " So , what did you think ? " After the museum Robin just said , " Very medieval . " <p> Hal had prepared an elaborate picnic complete with a fine bottle of wine , and they spread a purple sheet in the shade of a tree . Though he and Bonnie had lounged under this same tree , they 'd never bothered to bring a meal . Hal arranged a plate for Robin and then for himself . As they nibbled , Robin smiled at him . Hal strained to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he kept refilling his plate with ceviche , asparagus vinaigrette . <p> A bursting shoe with tattered laces appeared on the edge of the sheet . The shoe belonged to a hefty , sharp-nosed woman wearing a translucent red dress and two coats . " I 'm hungry , " the woman said in a barely-audible voice . <p> Hal turned to Robin whose face reflected his own . He stood up and Robin followed his steps . He held out his plate to the woman , gave her a plastic fork . Hal said , " Here , you can have the rest of this . " He took the food off the sheet and arranged it in a circle on the grass . Robin folded the sheet . " Thank you , " the big woman said , and they waved good-bye to her . <p> As Hal and Robin passed a deli on the way back to his apartment , Hal said , " Do you mind if we just stop here for a second ? I 'm still hungry . " <p> He picked up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you actually going to eat that crap ? " <p> " I 'm hungry , " he said . <p> Robin surveyed his living room , and she stood in front of Bonnie 's necklace but said nothing about it . Hal munched on his snack , eating straight from the bag . Robin asked if he had any pictures of himself . He did have a pile of photographs on the night table , and he ushered her into the bedroom . <p> The photos spanned the years of Hal 's marriage , and all featured Bonnie . In most of them , Hal looked 1960s-ish , hairy , and a tad overweight . Robin flipped through the pictures and said , " God . " She looked at Hal as if checking whether he was the same person or if he were playing a practical joke . She said , " You never told me you had a beard or long hair . I 'm glad you do n't look like that anymore . " <p> " Thanks , " he said . " I suppose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty . " <p> " Thanks . " Hal sat down on the bed and took Robin 's hand . <p> " I want to take a shower , " she said . <p> " Why do n't you let me give you a bath ? " <p> Kneeling on the bath mat , massaging shampoo into Robin 's scalp , he remembered bathing Bonnie after her accident and Bonnie crying when soap got in her eyes . <p> " What 's wrong ? " Robin said . <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " Why are you crying ? " <p> He let go of her and wiped his eyes . <p> Robin said , " I 'll finish up here , and we 'll sit down and talk . " <p> In the corduroy chair in the living room , Hal hummed old tunes and waited for Robin . <p> Her wet hair gleaming , Robin perched on Bonnie 's chair next to him and asked what Hal had been crying about . Her sitting in that chair made him nervous . " I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " Oh , " Robin said . " Were you feeling unfaithful to her , being here with me ? " <p> " No . Not really . " Hal 's new tight jeans dug into him , and he shifted . " I mean , right before she died , she said I should go out and make other women happy . " <p> " What ? " Robin said , for once her voice loud . <p> " I 've been trying to make you happy , " Hal said . Robin rose and picked up Bonnie 's necklace which she twisted around her hand as she stood in front of him . " Do n't play with that , " he said , reaching to grab it from her . <p> Robin darted back , replaced the necklace on the table , as if she had just picked it up to use as a conversation piece . " I ca n't believe you . " <p> " What do you mean ? " His arms were gripping the arms of the chair . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? You used me . You are a user , " she said . <p> " Me ? " he said . She was very still , as if she were posing for a snapshot . Hal pushed himself out of the chair and stood near the angelfish . When he could no longer bear the silence , he said , as if he were addressing the fish tank , " Well , all you ever seemed to care about was sex , anyway . You used to seem to think I was doing a good job . " <p> " Job ? " <p> It came to him : " User , " Bonnie had been saying , not " Use air . " <p> Robin snapped her fingers under his eyes , and he blinked as if for once sunlight had entered the dim apartment . " Still not here ? " she asked . " Even now ? " <p> " I 'm sorry , " he said . They were quiet . Both of them were watching the fossil necklace . Hal picked it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Robin said . <p> Hal wrapped the necklace around his wrist . " I just ca n't be as good as I thought I could be . " He saw how smooth the skin on Robin 's face was , how young ; she had no wrinkles or scars . He said , " Sad . I 'm going to be sad though . " <p> " I 'm sad already , " she said . " And lonely . " <p> " Me too , " he said and , for some reason , they grinned at each other . <p> Robin fluffed her hair , which was now dry . She stood up , moved to the door as if she had to leave this instant or she would be late . " Let 's start getting it over with , " she said . <p> Hal wanted to give her something , but nothing came to mind . He asked if she wanted the jockstraps . <p> " Keep them , " she said . " A token of my affection . " <p> Aside from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglected exercising and ate improperly . He only shaved when he had to perform . He fixed window screens in a few apartments , but instead of chatting with the residents , he kept quiet . He dozed a lot and waited for Bonnie to appear , willing her to appear , but she did n't . <p> Coming home from tea and rehearsal at William and Francis 's the following week , he saw a man with a satchel , looking a bit like Santa Claus , climbing the steps from Hal 's basement apartment . When Hal got to his door , he looked for a package the man might have left , or a slip saying he should pick one up , but he found nothing . <p> The jockstraps were gone as was seventy dollars in cash , the stereo receiver , and the fossil necklace . A paper bag covered the aquarium . Hal ripped it off immediately but the fish swam in figure eights and seemed very disturbed . Hal took out his guitar and , in an attempt to soothe his pets , played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He called William and Francis but only got their answering machine . He phoned the police who said they probably could n't do anything and suggested he try calling the Help Line , a hot line for crime victims . <p> The hot line counselor giggled when he told her about the missing jockstraps , how they were of sentimental value . He was working up to telling her about the necklace but at her laughing , said , " Screw you ! " and hung up . He 'd never said that to anyone before , at least not within hearing distance . For a second he felt himself smile  --  it was kind of funny . <p> But not funny enough . On the sofa he fell into a mournful sleep , and once again , Bonnie would n't come back . When he awoke , in the same rhythm in which she 'd once chanted , " I ca n't stand it , I ca n't stand it , " he heard himself say , " Please do n't leave me . Please do n't leave me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
