Section : Humachines <p> Meet on of the creators of wearable computing and join him in his search for like-minded folks to live in an augmented reality <p> People find me peculiar . They think it 's odd that i spend most of my waking hours wearing eight or nine Internet-connected computers sewn into my clothing and that I wear opaque wrap-around glasses day and night , inside and outdoors . They find it odd that to sustain wireless communications during my travels , I will climb to the hotel roof to rig my room with an antenna and Internet connection . They wonder why I sometimes seem detached and lost , but at other times I exhibit vast knowledge of their specialty . A physicist once said he felt that I had the intelligence of a dozen experts in his discipline ; a few minutes later , someone else said they thought I was mentally handicapped . <p> Despite the peculiar glances I draw , I would n't live any other way . I have melded technology with my person and achieved a higher state of awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as images imprinted onto my retina by rays of light controlled by several computers , which in turn are controlled by cameras concealed inside my glasses . <p> Every morning I decide how I will see the world that day . Sometimes I give myself eyes in the back of my head . Other days I add a sixth sense , such as the ability to feel objects at a distance . If I 'm going to ride my bicycle , I 'll want to feel the cars and trucks pressing against my back , even when they are a few hundred feet away . <p> Things appear different to me than they do to other people . I see some items as hyperobjects that I can click on and bring to life . I can choose stroboscopic vision to freeze the motion of rotating automobile tires and see how many bolts are on the wheels of a car going over 60 miles per hour , as if it were motionless . I can block out the view of particular objects  --  sparing me the distraction , for example , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in a videographic world , as if my entire lite were a television show . And many people assume that by living my life through the screen , I do exactly what television leads us to do  --  tune out reality . In fact , WearComp has quite the opposite effect : Visual filters help me concentrate on what is important , heightening my sensitivity and setting my imagination free . I do of course have occasion to remove my computational prostheses , as when I sleep , shower or splash around in the ocean . <p> In addition to having the Internet and massive databases and video at my beck and call most of the time , I am also connected to others . While I am grocery shopping , my wife  --  who may be at home or in her office  --  sees exactly what I see and helps me pick out vegetables . She can imprint images onto my retina while she is seeing what I see . I hope to add to the population of similarly equipped people ; last fall at the University of Toronto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first course for cyborgs ( see " School for Cyborgs , " p. 40 . ) <p> Much of my passion has been fueled by a desire to restore some balance of privacy in a world where individuals are increasingly affronted by government surveillance and corporate encroachments . In fact , one goal of my work was to challenge the notion of totalitarian video surveillance  --  the now-common practice of a corporate or governmental establishment wishing to know everything about everyone in the establishment while revealing nothing about itself . Many department stores , for example , use large numbers of hidden cameras and yet prohibit customers from taking pictures . <p> I attempted to draw attention to this phenomenon of unreciprocated video surveillance in Shooting Back , a documentary I made during my day-to-day life in several different countries over a period of many years . Whenever I found myself in a store or some other establishment with electronic eyes perusing the premises , I asked its management why they were taking pictures of me without my permission . They would typically ask me why I was so paranoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course I was covertly recording this response using my own hidden eyetap video camera . Then I would pull an ordinary camcorder out of my satchel and give them a chance to explain their position for the record . ( The camcorder was simply a prop , of course , as the eyetap camera had been capturing the scene . ) The same people who claimed that only criminals were afraid of cameras had an instantly paranoid ( and sometimes violent ) reaction to my camcorder . Shooting Back was , I believe , the first documentary to be transmitted in real time to the World Wide Web while it was shot . ( Selected portions of Shooting Back may be viewed at http : //wearcam.org/ shootingback.html . ) Ahead of My Time <p> Growing up during the 1960s and early 1970s , I always seemed to be creating things before their time . I grew up in Hamilton , Ontario  --  a city on the western tip of Lake Ontario about 100 kilometers from Toronto . I came by this inclination naturally ; during the early 1950s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio . ( He had pursued radio as a hobby since his childhood . ) He had taught me quite a bit about electronic circuits by the time I started kindergarten . As a young child , I removed the head from a portable battery-powered dictating machine and replaced it with the head from a high-fidelity audio cassette deck . From this cassette transport mechanism , I built a system that enabled me to listen to music while walking around . While many people scoffed at this invention , I found it nice to be able to drown out background music while shopping , to assert my own idea of personal space , and to defend myself from theft of my solitude by the department stores with their Muzak . <p> In my teens I founded a concept of mediated reality , which I called " lightspace . " The goal of lightspace was to experience an altered perception of visual reality by exploring a large range of possible forms of illumination while observing a scene or object from different viewpoints . My work with lightspace led to the invention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would function as true extensions of my mind and body  --  and my desire to control these photographic instruments in new ways  --  created a need for the ability to program complex sequences of events . <p> I began to take this matter seriously , building a digital computer from a large number of electronic components salvaged from an old telephone switching computer . I did much of this experimentation in the basement of a television repair shop where I spent much of my childhood as a volunteer , fixing TV sets . In this shop I built up a great deal of knowledge about electronic circuits . <p> The result of my early efforts was , in the early 1970s , a family of wearable computers I called " WearComp0 . " Sometimes I took these cumbersome prototypes outside in search of spaces dark enough to explore the altered perception of visual reality I could create using portable battery-powered light sources . People would cross the street to avoid me , not knowing what to make of what must have looked to them like an alien creature . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than I did . After wearing one of these encumbrances from sundown ( when it got dark enough to use them ) to sunrise , my feet would be swollen , blistered and bleeding . <p> I continued to refine WearComp0 and its evolutionary successor , WearCom . After much tinkering , I came up with WearCom  --  my first system that truly qualified as a wearable computer in the sense that it was not just a special purpose device . WearCom was field programmable , with a full-function input device ( a keyboard and joystick for cursor control both built into the handle of an electronic flash-gun ) , text and graphical displays , sound recording and playback ( crude , home-brew analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters ) , and a wireless data connection to provide links to other computers . I completed this system in 1981 , before most of the world realized that computers could be portable , much less wearable . <p> Though an advance over my earlier prototype , WearCom was still a burden to lug . I wanted to reduce its bulk and make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to experiment with building components directly into clothing . I learned how to make flexible circuits that could be embedded into ordinary fabric . This work enabled me to make versions of WearComp that were not only more comfortable to walk around in but also less off-putting to others . <p> In spite of these advances , my life as a cyborg remained mostly solitary . I did connect quite literally ( by serial data cable ) with an understanding woman during my freshman year at McMaster University in my hometown of Hamilton . We faced unusual challenges in this configuration , such as having to choose which public restroom to use when we were joined . Thinking back , I imagine we must have made a comical sight , trying to negotiate doorways without snagging the cable that tethered us together . <p> Such relationships were rare , and it was seldom that I could get others to wear my seemingly strange contraptions . Many people were unable to get past my technological shell , which they apparently found more than a little odd . Still , multimediated reality had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the mid- 1980s I had a following of people on the fringes of society who shared ( or at least appreciated ) my vision . I was invited to shoot pictures for album covers and hair ads . By 1985 , I began to realize that it was n't just the finished photographs people wanted ; they also seemed to enjoy watching me take the pictures . Often I would be shooting in large warehouses , with audiences of hundreds of people . I began to realize that I had become a cyborg performance artist . By the end of the 1980s , however , I found myself yearning to return to my more substantive childhood passions for science , mathematics and electrical engineering . <p> While at McMaster , I added biosensors to the WearComp so that it could monitor my heart rate ( as well as the full EKG waveform ) and other physiological signals . I also invented the " vibravest "  --  a garment studded with radar transceivers and vibrating elements . Wearing this vest made objects at a distance feel as if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walk down the hallway , confident that any wall or other obstacle would be felt as warning vibrations on the appropriate side of the vest . By sparing myself from the cognitive load of processing all that visual information , I found I was able to think more clearly . <p> In 1991 , I brought my inventions to MIT as a PhD student . As a cyborg , uprooting myself from Canada was a formidable task , since I had installed my cyberbody in Canada over a period of many years . Going to MIT was a sudden move of my extended self . <p> First , I secretly climbed up onto the rooftops of buildings around the city to put in place the wireless data communications infrastructure I had brought with me from Canada . I had to quickly deploy my base stations at the top of elevator shafts or anywhere else I could find warm dry places . This way , whenever I wanted an Internet connection , these gateways would be ready to send the data to me , no matter where I was  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subway . <p> Although I kept in touch with my family through cyberspace , my first two years at MIT were lonely times IRL  --  in real life . I was , after all , the only person there with a wearable computer . Then in 1993 , at the request of a fellow student , a local engineer named Doug Platt built a wearable system . I was no longer the only cyborg at MIT . <p> It took some years to get other cyborgs at MIT , thus enabling the beginnings of a sense of community . Although I never succeeded in getting a large community outfitted with my high-speed packet radio systems , the cellular telephones that began to emerge provided another answer to the problem of connectivity . <p> By the end of 1995 , my work was attracting serious academic interest . I was asked to write an article about my work for IEEE Computer , a publication of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ' Computer Society . I also proposed an academic symposium on wearables and was referred to T. Michael Elliott , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a conference would legitimize the field , which until then had consisted in many people 's minds of " Steve , that crazy guy running around with a camera on his head . " Elliott was enthusiastic about the idea and in 1996 the Computer Society responded with an overwhelming " yes . " This marked a turning point in my acceptance by my professional peers . <p> More than 700 people attended this first IEEE-sponsored symposium on wearable computing , held in Cambridge , Mass. , in October 1997 . A gala " Wearables " event the following day drew 3,000 people . In that same year I received my doctorate from MIT in wearable computing . This was a gratifying culmination : I had turned a childhood hobby and passion into an MIT project , the topic of a conference , and a PhD dissertation . <p> This past year I returned to Canada to pursue my work at the University of Toronto . Why Toronto ? I had lived there in the mid-1980s , and the city had seemed very " cyborg-friendly . " I had sensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and openness that contrasted with the more cyborg-hostile and tense atmosphere of some large U.S. cities . Wearing Well <p> Although I spent many years developing WearComp in relative isolation , I welcome efforts to commercialize wearable computers . At the vanguard is Xybernaut , based in Fairfax , Va . Xybernaut 's latest model is being manufactured by Sony , indicating that the Japanese electronics giant has an interest in what some believe will become the Walkman of computing . Last May , Xybernaut organized its own conference on wearable computing ( and invited me to give the keynote address ) . I may also begin to license some embodiments of my original WearComp , as well as many of my more recent innovations , to companies who want to manufacture commercial systems . I think it will be especially important to make the cyborg outfit less cumbersome  --  something that 's long been a goal of mine . My latest version is quite sleek , and looks just like ordinary bifocal eyeglasses , with the eyetap point hidden along the cut line . Even when fully rigged , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realize that some people see me and my invention as a potential threat  --  like the Borg of Star Trek fame : " You will be assimilated . " Clearly , there are important philosophical issues to be explored . Not only is there the danger of the technology being used to monitor people to make them into obedient productive cyborgs , but there is also the potential that people will become too dependent on this technology . My goal as a responsible inventor and engineer , however , has always been to encourage the development and manufacture of wearable computers as a means of personal , not institutional , empowerment . That will make worthwhile all the obstacles and challenges I have faced during my more than 20 years of developing this technology . <p> I hope that if I bring WearComp to market , anyone who wishes to will eventually be able to become a cyborg . We 'll live in a collaborative computer-mediated reality that will allow us to no longer need to distinguish between cyberspace and the real world . And then this cyborg will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peers : Steve Mann ( right ) and one of his University of Toronto students . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Shared vision : In this scene from Mann 's documentary Shooting Back , the yellow-bordered panels indicate where he and a remote collaborator are directing their attention at the moment . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Evolution of a cyborg : Mann 's wearable rig has gone from the helmet of 1980 ( left ) to the visor of 1990 ( center ) to the more compact unit of 1995 ( right ) .

He developed his vision further at MIT 's Media Lab in the 1990s . Today , Mann may be the world 's only full-time " cyborg . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes , relying on its sensors and network connections to augment his experience of the world . Technology Review asked him to tell the story of the creation of the Mann/machine . <p>
