MARTHA 'S MOTHER , ELIZABETH LONG CRAWFORD , had been born with a lazy eye , and one morning when she was twelve her father and the doctor sat her down in the dining room at Marlcrest , the Longs ' place near Augusta , Georgia , and told her they were going to fix her so that a man would want to marry her someday . Her father held her on his lap while the doctor pressed a handkerchief soaked with chloroform over her nose and mouth , and she went under , dreaming of the beauty she would be . But the doctor 's hand slipped , and when Elizabeth came to , she was blind in her right eye . For the rest of her life what she remembered of that morning were the last sights she 'd seen through two eyes : the shadows of leaves on the sunny floor , the hair on the backs of her father 's hands , the stripe on the doctor 's trousers , the handkerchief coming down . Then blindness . The rise and the downfall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what she 'd lived through . <p> Marlcrest was a hard name to pronounce . The first syllable sprawled , it would n't be hurried ; the last climbed a height and looked down on the rest of the world the way Martha 's mother had done all her life . It had been a hard place to live , too . One hundred acres of level , sandy land on a bluff above the Savannah River , and a house raised high on brick pillars to offer its residents a view of the river , a chance at the river breezes . When Elizabeth married Perry Crawford , he agreed to live there , too . She was n't leaving . In the family cemetery on the bluff stood the Long tomb and the graves of ten children who 'd died at birth , who had fallen or been trampled by horses or killed by typhoid or yellow fever during the two hundred years the Longs had lived at Marlcrest . Before the Civil War , slaves hauled muck from the river-the marl of which the crest was made-to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mud , collapsed in the heat , snakebit , drowned . They were buried in a corner of a distant field that the pinewoods had taken back years before Martha was born , but even in her time one could still find pieces of broken dishes , shells , or empty brown medicine bottles under the pine needles , as if the people there had been buried by others who believed the dead could still be soothed and fed . <p> After the botched operation , Martha 's mother lived where the wheel had stopped and she 'd stepped off . The blind eye that the doctor had closed gave her a proud , divided look , as though half her face slept while the other stayed fiercely alert , on the lookout for the next betrayal . It was how she 'd looked at seventy-five-disfigured and ferociouswhen she 'd summoned Martha and her brother , Perry Jr. , to the nursing home in Augusta where they 'd put her after a series of small strokes left her incapable of living at Marlcrest any longer . For six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check she wrote . The doors of the house , inside and out , had filled up with locks . Every night she 'd called Martha or Perry Jr . The woman they 'd hired to stay with her was a thief , a drunk . Someone was downstairs picking the locks . It was that Herbert Long from up the road . He and his family , descendants of the slaves who 'd once lived on the place . For a hundred years , they 'd bided their time ; now they 'd come to steal from her . <p> At the nursing home that day , Martha and Perry Jr . found their mother in her wheelchair in the sun by the window , dressed in a beige linen sheath , her best gold earrings and pearl necklace , as though she were on her way to a club meeting or a reception . Her hair had been freshly restored to a cresting silver wave , and she was draped in Arpege perfume , as she had been in all her finest hours . " Well , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Martha asked , kissing her mother 's sweet , powdered cheek . <p> Some papers their mother had in her purse , that was the occasion . Notarized contracts . Smiling brilliantly , she handed over the documents , one by one , to her children . She 'd sold Marlcrest-the whole kit and caboodle-to a developer who planned to bulldoze the house , clear the land , build a subdivision there . Plantation Oaks , he 'd call it . " Here is a copy of the title deed , " she said , passing it to Perry Jr . " As you will see , it is properly signed and notarized . " He turned it over , held it up to the light , looking for the error that would void the contract . As for the family records and belongings-the contents of the house , she said , leaning toward them from her wheelchair with her hands folded in her lap and color in her cheeks as if she were about to reach the end of a thrilling story , savoring ( Martha saw ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of revenge on something else that had failed her-she 'd sold them all to a young man , a representative of a southern history museum in Atlanta . Smack , she struck the wheelchair 's armrest . Done . He 'd been coming to visit her in the nursing home since Martha and Perry Jr . had put her there-it had been almost exactly one year now . He 'd even driven her out to Marlcrest a time or two to pick up something she 'd forgotten . The Long family had many possessions of historical interest ; already the museum people were calling their belongings the most important collection of southern artifacts ever acquired in Georgia . Fine linen shirts and baby gowns sewn by slave seamstresses . Diaries and ledgers and sharecropper contracts . Tools , portraits . A complete record of plantation life . The young man had been so sweet to her . He had all the time in the world to sit and talk . He never sneaked looks at his watch , he did n't have to jump up and rush off five minutes after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perry Jr . had n't been expecting it somehow . What has been lived will be handed on . Throughout their childhoods their mother had told them she lived by high ideals , which meant that everything had to be right-but nothing ever was right , and so she was constantly , deeply , and bitterly disappointed by every person and every circumstance . Horsy had been her word for Martha , and in it were cataloged Martha 's lacks . A long face , big teeth , lank hair , eyes that shone with dark , equine clarity . Also Martha was too big , too meaty . She sweated in the summer heat , and in winter her fingertips were always cold . Perry Jr . was an adequate student , a satisfactory son . Even her husband , Perry Sr. , had failed her . The autumn when Martha was sixteen and Perry Jr . eighteen , their father sneaked off early one morning and went duck hunting alone in the swamp below the old slave burying ground and was struck dead by a heart attack . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his gun across his knees , his forehead resting above the square window-hole in the sidewall of the blind as though he were watching the mallards flash and preen in the dark water below . <p> His death made their mother furious ; she 'd widened her search for the thief who 'd robbed her . And yet , though Martha and Perry Jr . had expected that someday their mother would get to their names on her long list of suspects in the crimes against her , neither was prepared for it . Is anyone prepared for the actuality of life , which is always more surprising or horrifying or sweet than we could have imagined ? Not at all . We dream and wish and plan , but something more subtle , more generous and devious , arranges reality for us . <p> After they 'd heard all their mother had to tell about what she 'd given away , after she 'd leaned back , satisfied , and looked from one to the other of them with that brilliant and terrible any questions ? look on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bulldozer push the house , which swayed , cracked , fell , carrying beds , tables , chairs , the smell of closets , her grandmother 's round hatboxes and furs , the river 's wide curve that she could see from her bedroom window in winter when the trees along the banks were bare . Carrying even the slave cemetery , where , in the spring just past , Martha had found weeds pulled , plastic lilies in a Mason jar propped against a pine tree . For the first time she felt the world move away from her the way her mother had taught her it would , not with words exactly , though Elizabeth had certainly given her children enough of those , but with her turned back , her receding footsteps , her closed face , her fury . <p> Their mother died within a year of that day . A stroke , of a magnitude even she would have approved-maybe-as the cause of death in a person of her stature , knocked her out of her wheelchair in the nursing home dining room one Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched her . In her coffin , Martha was surprised to see , her mother looked different than she had in life . The perfect wave of silver hair was intact , as were the long , elegant fingers , but her face , without the ferocious hauteur that had been its life , looked wasted and starved , as if under the rage a ravenous sadness had been at work . Not even the undertaker 's crafted composure , the small rueful smile he 'd shaped on her mouth , or the benign glow of the pink bulbs in the funeral home lamps could soften the face she would wear now into eternity . <p> -2 <p> What do you do with what you 've been handed ? Martha would not have her children saying poor Mother over her coffin . She went back to the life she wanted , a calm and common life , firmly planted . As Martha saw it , her mother 's bitterness and rage were exactly as large and violent as her longings , and so it was these longings that Martha would uproot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maitland in the first place ( against her mother 's wishes ) , a decent man from a decent family , a big , careful , sober man with jug ears who wanted what she wanted . They lived in the country outside Augusta , and Raymond , a salesman , traveled up and down the coast . The eastern seaboard , he called it , because he believed the high-minded sound of those words gave him an edge over his coarser peers . From Myrtle Beach , South Carolina , to Jacksonville , Florida-that was his territory , and he sold , at one time or another , insurance , encyclopedias , building materials , pharmaceuticals , vending machine snacks , and office supplies . The drawers in their kitchen and den filled up with pencils , ball-point pens , rulers , rubber jar-lid openers , key chains , thermometers , and spatulas , all printed with the names and slogans of companies he 'd represented . <p> In the spring , summer , and early fall , he drove with the windows rolled down ( this was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars ) , his left arm resting on the window ledge , so that when he came home his arm was always sunburned . When he returned from a sales trip , it was one of their pleasures for him to shower , lie on their bed in his undershorts , and doze , with the fan blowing across him and the radio tuned to the light classics station , while she rubbed Solarcaine on his sunburned arm , as gently and patiently as if his skin were her skin , so that he imagined sometimes that the spreading cool relief came from her fingertips , their delicate , swirling touch . <p> Then one day in late July , the summer he was fifty-eight and Martha had just turned fifty-six , the summer Raymond Jr . finished graduate school at Georgia Tech and their daughter , Louise , had her second baby , Raymond returned from a week-long trip up the coast . He traveled for Tom 's Peanut Company then . He threw his car keys onto the kitchen counter and fell into her arms , groaning about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat . At his age , too . He smelled of fry grease and cigarette smoke overlaid subtly with metal , the smell of the road . Lucky they did n't find him dead of a heart attack , slumped over the steering wheel on the shoulder of some godforsaken backroad in the Pee Dee swamp . A desk job , that 's what he wanted now . To keep him closer to home , closer to her , that was the ticket . " Take a shower , " she said . " Come lie down . " <p> While she rubbed the cream into his arm , she felt under her hands the silky slackness of aging flesh and noticed that his muscles were starting to droop , go ropy . His chest had begun to sag , too . And as she cataloged the work of time on her husband 's body , she noticed that his left arm was as pale as the rest of him . She looked at the small , pleased , and peaceful smile on his mouth . She sat on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Solarcaine squeezed onto her fingers , and a picture rose up to meet her as though his skin had released it , like a smell : a woman in green shorts , lounging in a white wicker chair , her big , tanned legs crossed , smoking a cigarette and laughing . <p> She rubbed the Solarcaine into his pale arm . Next day she went through the phone bills for the last six months , found call after call to a number in Little River , South Carolina . The voice that answered when Martha called matched the thick legs , the cigarettes , the indolence of the woman whose image had wormed its way into her mind . That night , when she showed him the phone bills , Raymond put his hands over his face and cried . It was true , he said , it was true , he 'd gotten in over his head . He would break off with her , her name was- " Do n't tell me , " Martha shouted , " do n't you dare speak her name in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him time . If she would just forgive him . <p> Patience she had , and time . Plenty of both . For six months they tried , but it had gone too far with the other woman . The story came out in pieces : the things he 'd given her-jewelry and cash , a semester 's tuition for her son at the University of South Carolina-the promises he 'd made . She was a widow , twenty years younger than Martha . It almost drove Martha crazy . Just when she thought she 'd heard the whole story , he 'd choke out more until it seemed there was no end to the future he 'd planned with this woman . <p> When Raymond left to go live with his big-legged woman in Little River , Martha told him she wanted two things , no three , she wanted three things : she wanted the house in Augusta , and she wanted the house in Scaly Mountain . While Louise and Raymond Jr . were still in high school , Raymond and Martha had bought a beat-up old white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roofed with tin , that sat on a foundation of stacked stones in a valley at the foot of Scaly Mountain , North Carolina ; they went there every summer and at Thanksgiving , too , if they could manage it . Always , when they got there , Raymond had to be first out of the car . " Let Daddy have his minute , " she 'd say to the children , holding them back . He 'd make a big show of stretching and breathing , as if he could n't get enough of that air . Then he 'd stand with his hands on his hips , his chest thrown out , king of the hill . Next he 'd turn , lean his elbows on the car door , push his wide , smiling face through the open window , and say , " We 're fifty-cent millionaires , Martha , sure enough , " as if this discovery were new to him every time , meaning it did n't take much to make him feel wealthy . Meaning that what he had was all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mouth , and they had arrived . <p> The third thing she wanted from Raymond was never to hear from him again . She meant it , too , about cutting him out of her life for good . She knew the way to the cold , bare space inside herself where she could live , if need be , by the absolutes she declared . Good-bye , Raymond . " I thank my mother , " she told Louise during the divorce , " for the strength she instilled in me . No , really . She 's the one who gave me the backbone for this . " Finishing cleanly , she meant , cutting the cord . <p> 3 <p> Five years after the divorce , Martha announced she was moving to her house in Scaly Mountain . " My thermostat must be broken , I ca n't take this heat any longer , " she told her daughter , who was frantic about Martha 's moving so far away , and all alone , too . " What if you fall ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart attack ? " <p> " Friend , come up higher , " she joked with her friends from the Episcopal church when they asked if she 'd thought through what she was doing . Others she told that she was retiring . From what , they demanded to know . From what ? From canasta on Monday and bridge on Tuesday ( she did not say ) , from standing in the vestibule before services on Sunday mornings , alert for a new face . ( " Welcome to All Saints ' . Are you visiting with us this morning ? Would you please fill out this card and drop it in the collection basket ? We 're glad to have you . " ) From taping books for the blind and pushing the book cart around the hospital corridors , intruding on the desperately ill , challenging them with her smile to feel better . From muffins and tuna-fish casseroles and sympathy calls and notes of congratulation or consolation . From rushing to church every time the doors swung open or having to explain her absence to some anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not speak to anyone of the solitude she craved : to be alone , with new sights in front of her eyes and unfamiliar , rocky ground below her feet . She did not tell anyone how she wanted to be rid of Raymond , whose cigarette smoke clung to the paneling in the den and lingered in the closets of the Augusta house . The week before she made her decision , she 'd come across a moldy package of Tom 's cheese crackers in the back of a drawer , and she 'd known then that this house would always push reminders of Raymond up to the surface , no matter how much she threw away . He rested more lightly on the mountain house . There she would lift Raymond 's few T-shirts out of the dresser in their bedroom and tear them into rags ; she would take down his coffee mug from a kitchen shelf , tear his handwritten instructions off the wall between the water heater and furnace . Then she 'd be finished with him for good ; he would be gone the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still visited dutifully twice a year , carrying a poinsettia at Christmas , a lily at Eastertime , standing with head bowed , her heart empty of any longing to see her mother , of any wish to speak . <p> But a person ca n't just do nothing , can she ? Ca n't sit all day with her hands folded or a game of solitaire spread out on the kitchen table . Ca n't not talk to other people without beginning to hear strange echoes in the conversation she 's carrying on with herself . So . She had the pasture behind the house cleared , she put in a pond . She added two rooms and a back porch onto the house , she lengthened the kitchen until the house looked like a white , wooden shirt with outstretched arms . Twice a week she drove her white Dodge Dart over the mountain and into Highlands , to the Senior Citizens Center for canasta and talk . <p> Every week she wrote her children-letters full of questions and advice . " Have Sarah Lynn 's teeth shown any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If not , do please take her to the orthodontist . " And " Those old linen napkins I gave you are to be used as tea towels , " she instructed after she 'd visited Louise and found the napkins balled up in the rag basket under the sink . Her daughter 's letters were long and chatty , with fabric swatches stapled to them or pictures of the children enclosed . Raymond Jr . wrote his full-speed-ahead notes on " Memo from Raymond Maitland Jr . " paper . He was big in Coca-Cola down in Atlanta , she told her friends over the canasta table . Very big , she 'd repeat , arching her eyebrows to show that words could not map the circumference of his orbit . <p> Without fail she wrote a weekly letter to her brother , Perry Jr . After his wife died , he 'd drifted into mysticism , joined the Rosicrucians . His letters were about the migration of souls , the power of the spirit to transcend time and space , to enter that place where there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current that carried you up and up , toward fulfillment , completion . He wanted to join his wife , he wrote . He could hardly wait for that day . <p> Martha sat in her bedroom in the mountain house she had made her own-no trace left of her traitor husband or her bitter storm of a mother , not so much as a photograph-a plain , tall woman in a sleeveless blouse and a full skirt made of a coarse , woven material like burlap . Her braids were crossed and pinned over the top of her head ; she wore orthopedic sandals with wool socks and sat with her ankles crossed , her back very straight in a high-backed chair pulled up to a white wooden table . One must be realistic , she wrote to her brother , apply the styptic pencil to one 's scratches , pour iodine into the deeper wounds , get on with life in this world . Reality , she stressed , was a constant and trustworthy companion who , once befriended , never let one down or walked away and loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wanting what it is impossible to have . What was finished must be done with and put away . " False hopes are cruel , Perry , " she wrote . " We must not exhaust ourselves waiting for what will never happen . I speak from experience when I say this . As you well know I have suffered indignities at the hands of life , we all have , but the longer I live the surer I become that the consolations of life must be sought and found in facing it squarely , as it is . The mind must not be allowed to wander where it wants , else it might end up lost in a wilderness of longing and regret . This I believe . " <p> And then , late one September afternoon when she 'd lived in Scaly Mountain for a year , when the pond was full , the meadow fenced , the hay rolled and drying in the field she leased to a neighbor , as she sat on the porch after supper , watching the evening light flood into her valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed in her . She felt it catch , then roll over the way tumblers move inside a big lock . Maybe it was the gold light slanting over the hay that invited the change . Maybe it was the chore she 'd finished-writing her mother 's name and date of death in the Long family Bible-or the way she sat with the book open on her lap , watching the ink soak into the page and dry . <p> Now this was no modest Sunday school Bible with a white pebbled cover and gold-leaf pages , a tiny gold cross dangling from a red-ribbon marker . It was the original family Bible in which the record of Long births , weddings , and deaths had been written since 1825 . It was a heavy book with a tooled leather cover , a lock and key . It smelled of the smoke of many fires , and its registry pages were stained and soft as cloth . When her father had opened it for family devotions , Martha used to imagine thunder rolling out of its pages . She had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitation and without guilt , she 'd lifted it off the carved wooden stand next to the fireplace in the downstairs parlor , where it had rested throughout her life and her mother 's life and her mother 's and her mother 's lives , and taken it home . For a year the museum inquired about the Bible , tentative , respectful letters at first . Later , letters from lawyers began to arrive . She 'd ignored them all . Now , looking from her mother 's name out to the hay drying in her meadow , she felt herself lifted and carried and then set down one place closer to the head of the line her mother had vacated . <p> That 's when the idea of the reunion came to her . She would gather what was left of the Long clan around her , here , in this place . The next morning she drove into Highlands and ordered stationery printed up with Long Family Reunion embossed across the top . She set the date for the following summer : July 6-9 , 1969 . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then sent back diagrams of the house with all the beds assigned . <p> Give Martha time , her brother used to say , and she could plan anything . Perry Jr . had been in the war ; he 'd landed with the Allies on D-Day . Martha could have planned that . She 'd certainly planned this . Collected promises from twenty-five of them , then stood in the parking lot she 'd leveled in her meadow and waved them to their designated spaces with a flashlight , like a state trooper at a football game , then carried their suitcases and marched them up to the house and directed them to their rooms . <p> For the children there were relay races and treasure hunts and nature hikes down the valley with Martha at the head of the column , a walking catalog of tree , reptile , and stone lore , like the Scout leader she 'd been when Louise was growing up . The girls had nicknamed her Skink , the lizard , for her bright-eyed , darting restlessness . For the grownups there were talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was the Long family tree , a scroll as big as a blueprint , on which their genealogist had mapped every twig and root . At night there were games and prizes . A prize for the oldest Long , a dim old uncle , ninety-three that summer , who sat patiently wherever he was put until someone came back for him . And for the youngest , a son born in June to Lamar Long , who 'd been promoted that summer to foreman of the weave room at the Bibb Mill in Porterdale , Georgia . A blue baby they called him , born with a defective valve in his heart , a good baby , all eyes , who lay quietly in his basket studying the faces that hung over him . <p> Bossiest woman in the world , they whispered among themselves . A real battle-ax . Exactly like her mother , poor soul , some of the other ones said . Even Perry Jr . had butted heads with her in the kitchen over something silly , over cream . One morning he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skim a dollop of cream for his coffee from the clot of it in the neck of one of the bottles of raw milk that Martha had bought from a neighbor up the road . Right behind him came Martha , who plucked the bottle out of his hand before he could shut the refrigerator door . " I am saving this , Perry , " she told him , " to go on top of the blackberry pie I shall make for the farewell dinner . " <p> " Oh , come on , Martha , I only want a teaspoon , " he said . <p> " Certainly not . " For half an hour she gripped that milk bottle , and they argued . <p> " I want some of that cream , Martha , " Perry said toward the end of the standoff , holding out his cup . " Just a smidgen to put in my damn coffee . " <p> " You ca n't have it , Perry , " she said . " I told you , it 's for the pie . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show him . . not the thick yellow clot atop the milk , but the cream whipped into high , stiff points and her pie , warm and rich beneath that sweet , smothering layer . Could n't he see it ? She could , and the thought of that cream-to-be made tears stand in her eyes . Then the thought of herself crying over whipped cream made her furious . She who 'd written her brother about dignity and the pitfalls of looking too far into future or past for happiness or for consolation , who had thrown all the force of her considerable will into living in the world as it is . Finally , Perry Jr . had slammed his cup down onto the counter and walked out . That night he said to one of the other men , " Well , I had to lock horns with Martha today . " And a child who overheard the remark and the laughter that followed pictured two warring moose in a mountain meadow , their enormous racks locked together , shoving each other until they fell from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bones covered with flaps of dried hide , the bleached antlers still entangled . <p> On the last day of the reunion , as she 'd planned , Martha climbed the rickety wooden stepladder , shooed away helpers , and strung Japanese paper lanterns from the big silver maple beside the road to the cedar nearest the house . At 6:15 they would eat , followed at 7:00 by speeches , testimonials , recollections , a song or two , and a last word from the genealogist , who 'd traced the family back to England and tonight would name for them the place from which the first Longs had set out for the New World hundreds of years before . Exactly at 6:00 P.M. , Martha struck a small silver bell with a silver fork and waited until its clear note had died away , then invited everyone to line up , which they did , oldest to youngest , as she 'd planned . Then they filed past the tables made of sawhorses and planks covered with white cloths , which stretched clear across the front lawn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beans , cornbread , banana pudding and coconut cake and , of course , Martha 's blackberry pie topped with a mountain range of whipped cream . <p> They 'd just settled down to eat when she heard Abel Rankin coming down the road . He was her neighbor , the one who sold her the raw milk out of cans he carried in the back of his wagon , that wholesome milk , from his own cows , from which she 'd salvaged all the cream . When she heard the clink of the cans , the jolting rattle of the wagon , the jingle of Sawdust the mule 's bridle and the stumbling crack of his hooves on the rocky road , she dished up a plate of green beans , mashed potatoes , chicken , biscuits , and coconut cake and walked to the edge of the yard to wait under the silver maple . When Abel Rankin saw her , he reined in the dun-colored mule and said , " Evening " ( never quite meeting her eyes ) , touched the brim of his brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held up to him . He ate quickly , hunched over on the wagon seat as though eating were a chore he had to finish before nightfall , while she held Sawdust 's bridle , patted his face , felt the bony plank of his nose , his breath on her hands . When the children came running to pat the mule , she took charge . She made them line up and listen to her instructions . " Now , stroke his nose lightly , " she said . " You must stroke an animal as lightly as you 'd stroke a hummingbird . You want him to remember you ? " she asked . " Blow into his nostrils . Gently , gently , like this , you hear me talking to you ? " <p> Those were her mother 's teachings , her mother 's actual words . As soon as they 'd left her mouth , she felt her mother walk up and stand behind her , listening , to hear if she 'd gotten it right , how to treat an animal . Her mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpolluted by her general disappointment and bitterness . No animal had ever betrayed her . Oh , no . When Martha had been a child , there was always a pack of half-starved stray dogs skulking around the back steps at Marlcrest waiting for her mother to feed them , a shoebox on the stove full of baby squirrels rescued from a fallen pine , wrapped in flannel and bottle-fed into independence . <p> Her mother had owned a Tennessee walking horse , a flashy bay named Jimbo whose black mane and tail she 'd braided with red ribbons before she rode him in shows . She used to nuzzle , stroke , pat the horse while Martha hung on the paddock fence , listening to the darkgold and fluid warmth that filled her mother 's voice when she talked to him , waiting for that warm and liquid love to overflow the dam in her mother 's heart and pour over her . Waiting , still waiting . And now Elizabeth had come and stood so close that Martha imagined she heard her mother 's breath whistling down the bony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd traveled this long way to find Martha and withhold her love again , just to remind her daughter , as a good mother should , that there was more to be done to win her love , that Martha must be patient and not lose heart . <p> Martha held her breath , then shook her head to clear it and turned to see if anyone had noticed her standing there like a fool with her eyes squeezed shut and her fists clenched at her sides , swept away in a fit of the hope she 'd worked so hard to conquer . Up on the wagon seat , Abel Rankin worked steadily at his supper ; the children cooed and stroked Sawdust 's nose and laid their cheeks against his whiskery muzzle . In the yard , people sat on the green grass and on the porch , enjoying their food , going back for more , lifting thick slabs from her beautiful pie . What a ridiculous old woman you are , she thought : standing there waiting for your dead mother to touch you . Now here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , bubbling out at Martha 's feet like a perverse spring . This sly and relentless force that moved through the world , this patient and brutal something people called hope , which could not be stopped , ever , in its work of knitting and piecing and binding , recovering , reclaiming , making whole . Which formed from the stuff of your present life a future where you would be healed or loved and sent you running forward while it dissolved and remade itself ahead of you , so that you lived always with the feeling , so necessary to survival in this world , that you were not just trudging along but moving toward something . <p> She guessed that if you could just give up hope , your time on earth would be free of longing and its disfigurements . God knows she 'd tried . But you could n't . Not even her mother had done that , finally . Even after she 'd sold Marlcrest out from under them and momentarily righted the wrong of her life by taking from someone else what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr . and Martha had kept up the pretense of caring for their mother 's poodle . <p> Rowdy was his name . Martha had taken him in-her only inheritance-when Elizabeth went into the home . He was thirteen years old , morose and incontinent , a trembler , a fear-biter . Nothing left of him but gluey old eyes , a curly coat , and bones . On a Saturday morning three months after she took him in , while Martha was at the grocery store , Rowdy had turned over her garbage and eaten a small Crisco can of rancid bacon drippings . When Martha returned , she 'd found him on her kitchen floor , greasy and struggling to breathe , and had rushed him to the vet 's , where he died two hours later , his blood so clogged with fat his old heart finally choked on it . <p> And yet until her dying day their mother had been greedy for news of Rowdy , details of his diet , the consistency of his stools . Martha and Perry Jr . had given them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and forth , sharing the wealth . On one visit , Perry Jr . would tell Elizabeth how on cool fall mornings Rowdy had enough spark left in him to chase squirrels around Perry 's backyard . On the next visit , Martha would continue the story , say that Rowdy still enjoyed his dog biscuits , even though he gummed them now and it took him forever to eat one . He 's a little constipated , she would say , but he 's fine . " Well , then , you 're not feeding him enough roughage . Feed him apples . I must have told you that a thousand times , do n't you listen when I talk to you ? " their mother would say , the old fierceness darkening her good eye . Then she would smile . Toward the end , when she smiled at them it was her skull that smiled ; then the wailing would begin . " Why do n't you bring my little dog to see me ? " she would sob . " Soon , Mother , " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . " Next time . " <p> 4 <p> Now it is August , twenty-five years past the summer of the reunion . Olivia Hudson , one of Martha 's grandnieces , is driving through the mountains with her husband and small son when they pass a road that runs up a narrow valley , and she says , " That looks like the road to my great-aunt Martha 's house , the one where we had the family reunion , remember my telling you about that ? " She had been seven that summer , the blue baby was her brother ; in photographs she stands protectively close , her hand always resting near him , on the side of bed or blanket . Now they turn back and head up the valley , and as they drive Olivia studies the landscape , looking for clues . She can not imagine that the house is still standing , but she hopes some arrangement of trees and pastures and fences will rebuild it in her mind 's eye and set it down on its lost foundation . She hopes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading up to an overgrown field . Anything . <p> Instead , they drive around a curve and she sees the house , the house itself , rising out of a jungle of saplings and shaggy cedars . Silver maple saplings , hundreds of them , Olivia sees as they drive closer . The leaves flash and flutter in the breeze . A realtor 's sign lies on its side in the grass , near the stump of the big silver maple that has spawned the little trees , the one that threw its wide shade across the front lawn the summer of the reunion . And what Olivia feels as they wade and push toward the house through the thick grass and saplings is an emotion so quick and powerful it takes her by surprise . It is as potent as love recovered , the feeling itself , not the memory of the feeling-an urge to laugh out loud and also a dragging sadness , and a longing for no particular person or thing , a longing to know what the longing is for . <p> And Olivia thinks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else 's , unpainted and falling down , screens kicked out , the yard full of junk cars , or if a picket fence had been thrown around it , a straw hat with flowers in the band hung on the door , its power to move her would have dissolved into its new life . As it is , its power is original , strong . She feels as if she could walk up there and look in and find them all at dinner , Martha circling the long table , pouring raw milk into the children 's glasses , and the mothers following her , pouring it out , refilling the glasses with the store-bought , sanitary kind . <p> Of course , what she sees when they 've waded through the grass and stepped over the rotten place on the porch and looked through the cloudy glass of the narrow window beside the door is the front room of an abandoned and neglected house . Bloated chairs , papers scattered around the floor , nuts and white droppings everywhere , in one corner a cardboard box packed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down the mountain they find the realtor . Billie is her name . She has diamonds on the wings of her glasses , jewels on her long black Tshirt , ragged black hair , and Cherokee-dark eyes . Cherokee cheekbones . She is so heavy and short of breath that Olivia 's husband has to boost her up the broken steps , but when they get inside the house , she turns brisk , businesslike . Martha 's children still own the place , but they 're so busy they never come here . That 's why they 've put it up for sale . Someone is about to buy this place and turn it into a bed-and-breakfast inn , take advantage of the business from the new ski slope over at Scaly Mountain . Since Olivia is kin ( Billie can see the resemblance now that she 's been around Olivia for awhile , yes : " You favor your Aunt Martha , " she says ) , would n't she be interested in buying it ? Of course , Olivia would have to make an offer right away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expecting an offer any minute from the bed-and-breakfast people . <p> Books lie scattered on the floor of every room ; faded curtains sag from bowed rods ; blackberry vines tap against the glass in the kitchen door . " You know , people around here say this place is haunted , " Billie calls to Olivia as Olivia starts up the stairs to the second floor . " Your great-aunt Martha died in this house , and they say she came back as a cat to haunt it . " <p> Olivia laughs . " If anyone would haunt a place , it would be Martha , " she calls down , thinking of the grizzled tabby with the shredded ear and stony face that was sitting on the porch when they drove up . The cat dissolved like smoke between the foundation stones when they stepped out of the car . Thinking of Martha 's tenacity . The famous struggle with her brother over the cream . She thinks of Martha fighting battles , righting wrongs , the clean , bleached smell of her clothes . Martha had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one lifetime , no doubt about it . Naturally her spirit would live on here , poking and probing and quarreling on , striding , big nose first , into a room . <p> Remembering all that , Olivia comes into the long room under the eaves where the women and girls slept during the reunion . Now it is full of rusty file cabinets and busted-open suitcases and , strangest of all , in a closet , a wedding dress and veil , vacuum-packed in a white box under a clear plastic window , without a date to place it in time or a name to connect it with anyone 's life . Outside the window that 's set so low in the wall she has to stoop to look through it , Olivia sees her husband following their son through tall grass , and beyond him , a dip in the overgrown meadow where Martha 's pond once lay , that shallow , cold , muddy pond that never cleared except where it ran over the spillway . <p> Olivia opens a drawer in one of the file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through crumbling folders stuffed with brown and brittle papers . Real estate forms , a Rosicrucian newsletter , Long Family Reunion stationery . She thinks of the week she spent in this room , The Hen 's Roost , the men had named it . All that clucking , fussing , preening , a bunch of broody hens . Her father , who loved jokes , had lettered the name on a piece of cardboard along with a drawing-a plump hen with a big behind and long eyelashes , looking coyly over her shoulder-and tacked it onto the door . Olivia had never before been included among the women nor surrounded by so many of them . They slept under starched sheets and thin blankets on old camp beds set in rows . She pulled her cot near the window , next to her mother 's cot and the baby 's basket . From there she watched the moon rise , the constellations wheel up from behind the mountain , the morning light fill the valley . The month before she died , so Olivia has heard , Martha added a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now this house and all its rooms have been died out of , left and locked away , abandoned , begun again and never finished . <p> " Your Aunt Martha really knew her way around these mountains , " Billie calls up from the bottom of the stairs . " One time she went to a neighbor 's funeral at the Church of God up the road there and another woman went with her who was n't from here either . But that other woman , she dressed up in high heels , a nice navy dress , a mink stole , and a hat . You know those Church of God people are strict . They do n't allow any fancy show in their churches . They say that when that woman came in dressed in her finery and took a seat , everybody turned and stared until she got up and left their church . But your Aunt Martha now , she wore a plain black cardigan sweater over a dark dress . She wore low-heeled shoes . She came in and sat in a back pew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was one of their own kind . " <p> Olivia is pleased to hear about Martha 's dignity for a change . It returns height and luster to the foolish and shopworn figure her aunt has become over time , handed down through the family stories . All over that part of the mountains , Billie says , people had talked about Martha at the funeral as though what she had done there were something remarkable . But when the story got back to Martha , she did n't see what all the fuss was about . It came as no surprise to her that she 'd done the right thing . Dressing for the funeral that morning , she had n't given a thought to what she should wear : everyone knows what to wear to a funeral . She 'd just reached into her closet and pulled out a black dress . Since it was a cool fall morning , she 'd also put on a black sweater . At the last minute she 'd even slipped off her gold wristwatch and left it in a drawer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that stern congregation . The watch had been a birthday gift from her children one year , and looking at it reminded her of their faces-small and clear and full of light-when they were young and the days ahead seemed numberless . <p> She went into the crowded , chilly church and sat in the back pew and listened to the congregation sing a hymn . Harsh , unaccompanied , the singing reminded her of a creekbed in a drought with the sun beating down on bald stones , but that dry creek carried her anyway , back to the summer of the reunion and the orchard up the road from her house . The haunted orchard , her grandchildren had called it , and begged her to take them to see . Where a blight had killed the trees and left them loaded with apples that withered and puckered and clung to their branches through one winter and the following spring and on into the summer . Standing there with the children , she 'd turned to her daughter 's oldest boy . " And what do you intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert Redmond ? " she asked . <p> He 'd looked up at her out of pale blue eyes as he pivoted on his heels , inscribing circles in the dirt of the road . He was ten , beginning to fizz . He wore red high-tops , a whistle on a lumpy purple-and-orange lanyard that he 'd made at Boy Scout camp earlier that summer . " A fiftycent millionaire , " he said , grinning . <p> Hearing Raymond 's words in the child 's mouth had made her heart pound , her cheeks flush . And just like that , Raymond had joined them , uninvited , unwelcome , with his gosh-and-golly face , his pale traitor 's arm , all the things she 'd made herself cold and deaf and blind to years ago . " Well , son-of-a-gun , " he might as well have whispered warmly in her ear , insinuating more , " how about them apples ? " First her mother had come back , now Raymond . It took so little for hope to cling to , to coax love to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope you wo n't waste too much of your valuable time pursuing that course , " she had said , staring at the orchard , dizzy , suddenly , as though she 'd waked up to the earth 's circling , the endless motion of return that had brought her here to this orchard with her grandchildren , where it seemed for a moment that the stubborn and contradictory truths of those trees merged with the warring truths of her own life : the trees had died , but the fruit would not fall . Inside the fruit she saw seeds ; inside the seeds , more fruit . She saw in this motion the turning shadow that eternity throws across this world and also the current that carries us there . When the hymn was done she listened to the preacher tell the story of the narrow gate , the strict accounting , the raked , leveled , and weeded ground of the promised land toward which they traveled in sure and certain hope of the resurrection . And when the service was over , she stood outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were kin . <p>
