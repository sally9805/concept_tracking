McKay . Across the top , in gold type dropping out of a dark green band , stands a blurb from Cornel West : " A classic of splendid proportions , " he announces , leaving the reader to wonder whether he is referring to the book 's large size or to its contents . What only specialized observers will know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volume 's two editors , is Chair of the Afro-American Studies Department at Harvard University , where West , when not busy writing content-free blurbs for Gates 's books , reports to him as one of the department 's best-known professors . The world of African American studies is a small one , but over the last twenty years it has become enormously influential within American universities and , more recently , in the culture at large . Henry Louis Gates Jr . sits atop that world . The Norton Anthology in the first month of its publication sold more than 30,000 volumes , making it the fastest-selling anthology in the illustrious history of Norton literary textbooks . Gates , a promotional wizard , can be at least partially credited with the book 's enormous success . Glowing reports of its achievement appeared in such forums as Frank Rich 's op-ed column in the New York Times , in that paper 's culture pages , and on a Charlie Rose show largely dedicated to Gates that aired in February . On other fronts in the Gates empire , one could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essays and profiles entitled Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Black Man and , not long after , similarly positive reviews of The Dictionary of Global Culture , co-edited with Kwame Anthony Appiah . And although he was not one of the editors of The Oxford Companion to African American Literature , also published this year , Oxford turned to him for his imprimatur in the form of a foreword to the book . Having one 's name on four major books in a couple of months is impressive work . Gates 's memoir of three years ago , Colored People , was similarly well-reviewed , his pieces are regularly published in The New Yorker , and he is quoted and called upon by journalists in most significant commentaries about black America . Gates resides now in a position almost unimaginable three decades ago , when he was a young intellectual working shrewdly beside rather than within the Black Arts movement . To attain such a position of authority requires several well-developed skills . Hard work certainly helps : Gates has written six books of his own , including four earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another with West ; edited not only The Dictionary of Global Culture and The Norton Anthology but the collection Reading Black , Reading Feminist ; and served as series editor for such monstrous projects as the complete works of Zora Neale Hurston , the forty-volume Schomburg Library of Nineteenth-Century Black Women Writers , and the thirty-volume African-American Women Writers 1910-1940 . In other words , Gates has made himself the most prolific and influential mainstream scholar in the most popular academic subject of our time . For the most part this is a fortunate thing . Gates ranks as the most able writer and critic in his field , and one of the best in literary academia . He is a smooth prose stylist and a reliably intelligent if rarely skeptical critic , one whose strength resides in the convincing advocacy of certain literary figures , movements , and forms rather than in diagnosis or deconstruction . Nevertheless , maintaining the position of chief spokesman for such a heavily institutional movement as multicultural literary studies also demands a continual , quick-footed dance with political orthodoxy-an orthodoxy now less obviously tilted toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more often riddled with internal contradictions . Gates thrives in these gray zones , as his own writing demonstrates . In Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Black Man , a collection of Gates 's profiles published largely in The New Yorker over the last few years , one may see the personal and political passions that animate him and stand central to his career as a critic and a scholar . The title of the collection-a play on the title of Wallace Stevens 's poem " Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird " - captures Gates 's main interests , which have evolved over the last ten years or so from the issue of authentic black expression to the larger question of what is authentic " blackness , " especially for black men . The problem is a personal one . He mentions it in interviews , in Thirteen Ways , in Colored People , and elsewhere . Focusing on such a question puts Gates in a difficult intellectual position , for it posits , and then balefully argues against , the assertion that legitimate and authentic culture in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black artist , writer , scholar , or politician can not define himself freely but must work within a complex role that already has been established for him-that of the outsider , the outlaw , someone heroically disadvantaged and separate . This issue of an enforced and disempowering identity haunts black American writers , of course , but for the best of them it remains secondary . Growing up in more hateful times , writers such as Ralph Ellison , Albert Murray , and James Baldwin forced themselves beyond the constraints of white culture ; they understood in a deeper sense their true relation to it ( thus can Murray openly admire Thomas Mann and Ellison can praise William Faulkner ) ; they came to value their own worth and to recognize the highly individual and essentially nonracial difficulty of knowing their own souls . No one has yet analyzed in any extensive way why a later generation of black American thinkers and artists often lacks this essential artistic self-confidence . Gates himself touches on the issue , especially in writing about Murray and Baldwin , but ultimately does not meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be to impute a failure , to condemn certain black writers of his generation . And condemn he does not . Only in Gates 's " outing " of Anatole Broyard , a writer who denied his black parentage and spent his life passing as white ( the payoff being a job as a book critic for the Times ) , does one sense in Gates a hardness of sentiment and a streak of intellectual disapproval . Interestingly enough , the Broyard profile is one of the most absorbing and elegantly written pieces in Thirteen Ways . The essay about the great critic Albert Murray forms the book 's most striking contrast between black writers and critics of Gates 's generation and those born earlier . Much of Murray 's thinking and writing is aimed at challenging conventional assumptions . He is suspicious of the reaction to such lovable black literary figures as the poet Maya Angelou and even asks what no other prominent commentator , black or white , has asked about Toni Morrison 's Nobel Prize-whether it was not " tainted with do-goodism . " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have always been " tainted , " to use Murray 's word , with politics , and the politics have always been left-of-center . Morrison 's work will last , I suspect , at least as long as Hemingway 's or Steinbeck 's . On the issue of Morrison , Gates politely puts down his foot , " agreeing to disagree " and associating himself with her in the ways major critics traditionally have endorsed certain writers as emblems both of their era and of the critic 's own aesthetic principles . In Maya Angelou , however , we have something else altogether . In the Murray profile , as elsewhere in these essays , when something negative is to be said , Gates lets other people do the talking while he stands by making no comment and offering no defense . Murray describes Angelou 's performance at Bill Clinton 's first inaugural as a kind of traditional black entertainment , dazzling the white folks . Gates includes the accusation but lets it sit there , like a burning car in an otherwise empty parking lot . In such silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been utterly marginalized , its critical discourse so deadened that a literary figure of Gates 's intelligence and stature can not bring himself to say anything bad about , or leave out of his pantheon , even the most mediocre black artists . At the inaugural , Bill Clinton , whose signature on welfare " reform " would follow three years later , used Maya Angelou , a very weak poet , as a new , mediagenic form of lawn jockey , and no one in the new black-culture orthodoxy , as far as I know , has uttered a word of criticism about her willitgness to pits tie liven the complexity of Gates 's role within the black intellectual community and his relationship with the white culture , The Norton Anthology , as he initiated it eleven years ago and as it appears with him as coeditor , becomes that much richer an emblem of the multicultural-studies movement . Gates has a unifying sensibility in a field that is fractious by definition . His aesthetic , I suspect , has helped lend the book its tone of distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of African American literature as a coherent development over the last three centuries . But it has also meant the inclusion of work that is not up to par and a suffusion of editorial sentimentality and weak politics . Photograph // Nonetheless , the anthology is an immensely interesting and valuable work . It will change the teaching of American literature in the classroom , spotlighting certain works that , because they were once difficult to find , only occasionally made their way onto university reading lists . Moreover , the volume may provide the happiest marriage of chronology with theme that I have seen in an anthology . The book is arranged with an introductory section , " The Vernacular Tradition , " that moves across all major periods and concentrates on music and the spoken word . Six main sections follow , each informed by the thematically overarching " Vernacular " section : " The Literature of Slavery and Freedom : 1746-1865 " ; " Literature of the Reconstruction and the New Negro Renaissance , " which takes one through 1919 ; " Harlem Renaissance : 1919-1940 " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Black Arts Movement : 19601970 " ; and " Literature Since 1970 . " Within these capacious rooms are stored amazing treasures : the fascinating early slave narratives , for example , and , closely related to them , what can be described as didactic tracts on slavery , which are extraordinary documents insofar as they detail the very mechanisms of repression constructed to prevent such writing . A reader can not help but recognize something miraculous in these early texts , not for any " defect overcome " by the Africans who produced them but for the lengths to which their overseers went to keep their slaves from mastering the English literary arts . Not only did the government of a given population of slaves depend on this repression ; the entire underlying presumption of black inferiority was threatened as well , a fact that the early writers unmistakably recognized and exploited . Among the slave narratives , one of the first and most direct , Olaudah Equiano 's " The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano , or Gustavus Vassa , the African , Written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression and its self-confident good humor . Victor Sejour 's short story , " The Mulatto , " the first known work of fiction by an African American , appears here in the first widely available translation from the French , and it is a small masterpiece . Also included are Harriet Jacobs 's " Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl , " Frances Harper 's poems and essays , and what is considered to be the first African American novel , Harriet E. Wilson 's Our Nig . Frederick Douglass 's extraordinary Narrative of the Life is reprinted in full , as is W.E.B . Du Bois 's equally seminal later work , The Souls of Black Folk , published in 1903 and containing the prophetic ( and starkly beautiful ) lines : " The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line , - the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa , in America and the islands of the sea . " Later , in the Harlem Renaissance section , is Jean Toomer 's " Cane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged : Karintha is a woman . She who carries beauty , perfect as dusk when the sun goes down . She has been married many times . Old men remind her that a few years back they rode her hobbyhorse upon their knees . Karintha smiles , and indulges them when she is in the mood for it . She has contempt for them . Karintha is a woman . Young men run stills to make her money . Young men go to the big cities and run on the road . Young men go away to college . They all want to bring her money .... A child fell out of her womb onto a bed of pine-needles in the forest . Pine-needles are smooth and sweet . In the period of intense literary experimentation in Europe and the United States , corresponding roughly to the second generation of liberty for African Americans , black writers were in a position of unusual freedom in their language and narrative sensibilities ; they drew on the cadences , idioms , and vocabularies of both black and white America , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European counterparts . By the early twentieth century , African American writers were not only able but eager to " make it new , " to use Ezra Pound 's exhortation . Especially in the early twentieth century and the Harlem Renaissance period , writers such as Hurston and Claude McKay and Toomer , among many others , moved gracefully into a powerful form of Modernism , echoing the aesthetic sentiment of one of T. S. Eliot 's early titles for The Waste Land : " He Do the Police in Different Voices . " Their essential historical experience , that of exile and debasement , is the Modern artistic experience . The anthology goes on and on , more than 2,600 pages featuring many , many fine writers , each sharing a culture and a language both permanently separated from and yet passionately defining something , often discussed but never satisfactorily captured , called " America . " The introduction of African Americans to the United States constituted in most cases an introduction to Christianity , and to American Protestant Christianity in particular . From the melange of biblical narratives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their own special purposes the central Christian narrative of prolonged suffering , isolation , imprisonment , and eventual redemption and release . Thus did Exodus , as one example , become their taleslavery , escape , trial , justification . " The Vernacular Tradition " as articulated by the editors , * with its overwhelmingly Christian atmosphere ( " Spirituals , " " Sermons , " even " Blues " ) , stands over the rest of the volume , giving meaning not only to the language of the African American tradition but to its philosophical foundations as well . The " Sermons " section , also within the introductory " Vernacular Tradition , " moves from early verse sermon to Malcolm X. The highlights include Martin Luther King 's " I 've Been to the Mountaintop , " which I have always preferred to his " I Have a Dream " speech , also included here , because the former is personal and anguished , and improvisationally explains the meaning of King 's entire ministry : I remember in Birmingham , Alabama , when we were in that majestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptist Church day after day ; by the hundreds we would move out . And Bull Connor would tell them to send the dogs forth and they did come ; but we just went before the dogs singing , " Ai n't gon na let nobody turn me round . " Bull Connor next would say , " Turn the fire hoses on . " And as I said to you the other night , Bull Connor did n't know history . He knew a kind of physics that somehow did n't relate to the transphysics that we knew about . And that was the fact that there was a certain kind of fire that no water could put out . And we went before the fire hoses ; we had known water . If we were Baptist or some other denomination , we had been immersed . If we were Methodist , and some others , we had been sprinkled , but we knew water . Unfortunately , though , there is an introduction to the section . The African American sermon is a complex oratorical form with significant differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to region , and era to era . Sermons heard in a northern Nation of Islam mosque differ significantly from those heard in a down-home Southern Baptist church . Those flattening out all of these differences to expound on the black sermon deny this pulchritudinous variety and do a serious injustice to history and its unfurling . Hyperbole and jargon rule the day . Repeatedly , and nowhere more than in the " Sermons " section , is the theme of " the vernacular tradition " abused in service of a favorite social theory of contemporary academics : a denial of the efficacy of actual individual authorship and a new definition of literature as a form of cultural production , the result of " call and response " between speaker and listener , the expression of whole communities . I , for one , have always preferred the late Harold Brodkey 's definition of literature . pure and explicit in its hegemonic tendencies : " I speak , you listen . " Fortunately we have the writers themselves . The nineteenth-century poetry and commentary by black women would make a fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted above ) ; the early slave narratives and slave poetry are composed of a language that feels immediate and , in the way that only Southern American writing can be , both elegant and colloquial in describing a circumstantial horror , often taking a surprisingly long historical view . Also to be visited in this volume are the incomparable greats of black literature in this century , including Du Bois , Langston Hughes , Ellison , Richard Wright , Hurston , Baldwin , Murray , Chester Himes ( though not enough of him ) , and Gwendolyn Brooks . Among contemporary authors , there are arrayed some of the best American writers working today , including John Edgar Wideman , Jamaica Kincaid , James Alan McPherson , and Walter Mosley . But perhaps most astonishing are the folktales , which constitute the single most entertaining and splendid portion of the anthology . I am a particular fan of " Deer Hunting Story " : You know Ole Massa took a nigger deer huntin ' and posted him in his place and told him , says : " Now you wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ah 'm goin ' " round de hill and skeer up de deer and head him dis way . When he come past , you shoot . " De nigger says : " Yessuh , Ah sho " will , Massa . " He set there and waited wid de gun all cocked and after a while de deer come tearin ' past him . He did n't make a move to shoot de deer so he went on " bout his business . After while de white man come on " round de hill and ast de nigger : " Did you kill de deer ? " De nigger says : " Ah ai n't seen no deer pass here yet . " Massa says : " Yes , you did . You could n't help but see him . He come right dis way . " Nigger says : " Well Ah sho " ai n't seen none . All Ah seen was a white man come along here wid a pack of chairs on his head and Ah tipped my hat to him and waited for de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of folktales heard , collected , and remembered , Mules and Men . Unfortunately , in a fit of caution , perhaps necessary given the passionately un-ironic audience that has created such a large market for this book , the editors add a footnote : " Note the deliberate spoofing of the white " Massa " by the ostensibly respectful nigger . " ' If there is a vernacular tradition in African American literature , there is an equally significant tradition of multilayered irony , and these tweedy , altogether Caucasian editorial moments do their best to undermine it . Like every Norton anthology , the present volume also houses a whole family of cultural and political assumptions that the genre can not acknowledge . Convention dictates that one must call this an " Anthology of Literature , " but literature as defined by most readers outside the university makes up only a portion of its entries . Documents of exclusively historical interest take up what seems an unprecedented share of the cabin space , and for reasons that are obvious but not always compelling , more pages here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in any other serious literature anthology I have seen . ( In a new twist , Norton also offers , through a mail-in card , an accompanying CD for $15.99 . ) The reader quickly understands that " the vernacular " was established in music and in other forms of public discourse and that its particular tropes and rhythms unify African American cultural experience and absolutely dominate its literary sensibilities . A fifth or a quarter of the songs appearing here would have done just as well . The inclusion of rap songs does n't particularly help ; they are not on the whole very inter esting to read , and their relationship to contemporary African American writing , or within the increasingly fractionalized African American culture , is not explained . As is , we are left to assume that " Tell old Pharaoh/Let my people go " and " All the jealous punks ca n't stop the dunk " are both simply parts of the same vital cultural experience . On the level of strictly literary particulars , the anthology contains many choices that one has to question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are overrepresented here , and overrespected , for that matter . Walker , for instance , is given three times the space of one of the best writers in the country , Jamaica Kincaid , and considerably more room than a host of other , better writers . A fine author of short stories , Edward P. Jones , is not here at all , surprisingly . Even looked at charitably , at least a dozen contemporary writers do not deserve to be in this volume . Take , for example , this excerpt from Walker 's The Color Purple . Sinners have more good times , I say . You know why ? she ast . Cause you ai n't all the time worrying bout God , I say . Naw , that ai n't it , she say . Us worry bout God a lot . But once us feel loved by God , us do the best us can to please him with what us like . You telling me God love you , and you ai n't never done nothing for him ? I mean , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preacher and all like that ? But if God love me , Celie , I do n't have to do all that . Unless I want to . There 's a lot of other things I can do that I speck God likes . Like what ? I ast . Oh , she say . I can lay back and just admire stuff . Be happy . This is like Zora Neale Hurston sent to a Hallmark indoctrination camp . The paradoxical position of the professors who edited the Norton Anthology of African American Literature ( there are eleven in all , plus dozens of professors and graduate students who assisted in research ) , curating and to some degree mummifying black American culture in the process , can be imaginatively reconstructed in their choice to reprint the words of Gil Scott-Heron 's " The Revolution Will Not Be Televised , " which they claim , interestingly , had a " vital impact " on rap . I have heard the recording many times but never read its lines stark on the page : " The revolution will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xerox in four parts without commercial interruption . . . " Clearly , Scott-Heron did n't foresee PBS 's " Eyes on the Prize . " In the full musical performance , one hears Scott-Heron 's voice , anger , adamancy , and ominous rhythm . What struck me while reading the lyrics was that ScottHeron , wrongly predicting victory where there would be only defeat , nevertheless puts his finger on exactly the mechanisms by which latetwentieth-century , high-tech capitalism absorbs and nullifies any idea , gesture , word , or image . The revolution was , in fact , beautifully televised , packaged on video , and African American literature has now itself been packaged , bound , priced , and marketed . The condition of American blacks worsens inexorably . As Gates himself observes in Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Black Man , " Thirteen decades have passed since Emancipation , and half of our black men between twenty-four and thirty-five are without full-time employment . One black man graduates from college for every hundred who go to jail . Almost half of black children live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in mind , and there is little comfort left in the collection . Are we all supposed to join in the national book party , rejoice with Charlie Rose ? Sure . Norton has published the Anthology of African American Literature ; Gates and Cornel West are entrenched at Harvard and are doing very well indeed . But The Norton Anthology of African American Literature , filled with genuine American treasure , remains a painfully paradoxical volume , for the politics that drive it are profoundly insufficient both to honor what lies in the book or the problems those politics were once invented to address . Footnote * The volume , it must be noted , gives satisfactions that its editors seem bent on taking away . Because Norton anthologies are marketed toward freshman survey courses and high school advanced-placement classes , the volumes often suffer from an unhappy combination of secondary-school-level explanations and sloppy scholarship . Under the " Gospel " section , of all places , in the song " Stand by Me , " a footnote for a reference to the release by God of Silas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silas , Stand by me . . . " ) reads in its entirety : " In the New Testament , Silas was a missionary for the Apostles . Paul was one of the twelve Apostles chosen by Jesus . " Paul is indeed considered an Apostle . But he is not one of the twelve and he never met Jesus , so a large part of this description is wildly inaccurate . The overall wrongness of the footnote conjures for the reader a team of dozens of clumsy university scholars , credited on the acknowledgments page , failing to explain the story of imprisonment and its resonance for a people enslaved , instead creating and then missing a howler that not one of the anonymous composers they honor would ever have thought to make .
