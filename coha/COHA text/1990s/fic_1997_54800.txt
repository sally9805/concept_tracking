Birnbaum sat on the plane facing west , trying on his new life . It suited him , he felt , like the new clothes  --  the thin cotton slacks the salesman told him would " breathe , " the mustard jacket with the twin triangles of red peeking from the pocket , the brown fedora , snap-brimmed , the feathers of some tiny bird in its band , which he held between two fingers in his lap . Before him , a whiskey sour brought by Connie the stewardess , pink liquid in a plastic cup . He had never tasted one before , but when Connie had offered a beverage  --  offering herself , it seemed  --  he said , " Why not ? " and ordered the most festive drink he could think of , the one Ruthie used to order at weddings . He took a sip of the sweet drink , set it on the table in front of him , brushed the small feathers in the hat lightly , and hitched up the slacks so he could feel the slide of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do their breathing . <p> He was a short man , with a wide forehead and expressive eyes . He had begun taller , but time , and his posture of shouldering a burden through the years , had compressed him an inch or two . He wore a look of furtive sorrow , of dreaminess , as if his toehold in the present were tenuous and his mind , behind restless brown eyes , flitted between a past and a future , neither of which he could accommodate . A wary man , he smiled whenever he could . He believed he saw it all coming . <p> Birnbaum , a retired accountant in somebody else 's firm , had never owned clothes like this in his life , and in the airport , waiting for the plane , had felt compelled to walk , to seek out people and conversation . He felt buoyed by the energy of the high glass hall  --  the expectant faces and holiday clothing , the outsize murals , gaily abstract , the calm , intimate announcements over the intercom , the pilots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the wide corridors , and the planes , nosing toward the gates like huge sea animals coaxed into the light by young men waving orange wands  --  as if they had all gathered here , Birnbaum and his fellow travelers , to leave the old life , journey from this place to somewhere new and begin again . <p> He wandered the airport lounges , found himself looking into people 's faces , grinning at them as if they had just heard the same joke . He bought a paper from a woman in the concession shop and made her laugh . He stopped to have his shoes shined at the high stand near the men 's room , though they were brand new , like the clothes , and he talked politics , baseball  --  the ballplayers he mentioned were twenty years re-tired  --  with the old man who looked up from around his ankles with a good-natured laugh . He paused to glance into mirrors , glassed-in restaurants and bars , again to feel the pleasant shock of recognition at the slim , prosperous middle-aged man blinking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking another sip of the whiskey sour , he toasted his friend Schteiner . " Absolutely , " he thought . " Good times . " <p> In Queens , in his dark bedroom several hours earlier , searching the parallel mirrors he and Ruthie had bought thirty years ago , he had been held by a different sight  --  thin hair in all directions , domed forehead over eyes that even in the darkness could not conceal their glint of mistrust , skinny legs nearly hairless now , arms weakly hanging , breasts  --  he watched a ridiculous , tired old man , some plucked fowl . In misery he sat on the disheveled bed unable to move until Schteiner had pounded the door , stuck a face running with toothpaste into the room . He wore one of Birnbaum 's pajama bottoms ; the green toothbrush looked familiar . " Shake a leg , Rothschild ! " he shouted . " Even for millionaires they do n't hold jumbo jets . " <p> Connie , a smiling redhead in blue , came down the aisle with a stack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think it would be gallant to lean over the weary-looking grandmother in the aisle seat who ignored Connie 's friendly smile . Connie widened pretty eyes at Birnbaum as if to indicate she knew which end was up . She was young , and beautiful , he thought . Her hair was pulled off her face in a loose bun , and in her lapel she wore a white carnation . He smiled back uncomfortably . " Here , " she said , pulling two magazines off the top . " You kids share these , " and to Birnbaum 's surprise and delight , she winked . <p> The magazines were Cosmopolitan and Vogue , both with ripe , heavy-lipped beauties on the covers who leaned at you so you could see all there was to see if you looked , which Birnbaum did n't , then did . Schteiner had brought one like this back from the barbershop one day , left it lying around , and Birnbaum , then too , had looked . He felt , rather than saw , the lady at his side fixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with disapproval , tiny beads of sweat dotting her upper lip . Briefly , he saw himself as he imagined she did , this old man in some foreigner 's clothing , brazening it into the world as if he had a place there . Amid dim panic , hearing Schteiner 's voice , Birnbaum tossed the magazines casually on the empty middle seat . " In my line of business , " he said , and paused to arrange a smile , " we 'd say she 's got moxie . " He pointed at the model in a green dress that looked painted on . " Oh , yes , " he said , sighing a little , as if he were tired , after all these years of models in green dresses , " this one has moxie to spare . " He smiled , crossed one leg over the other to indicate he was ready , if his companion was , for conversation . He wondered what he would say if she asked about his line of business , he having none . He wondered what " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Schteiner . He tried for a look of amiable and worldly patience , tossed his hat carelessly on the model 's face . He nodded , waiting . But the woman looked at him silently through calm blue eyes , as if coming to understand that here was the biggest fool on the airplane , and soon Birnbaum , his smile hanging on his face like a palsy , turned to the small window as the plane climbed slowly through thick oceans of cloud . <p> He was traveling west to see his son , whom he had not visited in four years , and whose strained relations with his father had resolved , finally , into a remote and wistful antipathy . There was a new granddaughter Birnbaum had never seen , a second wife he barely knew , though Ruthie had made the trip and returned with pictures , home movies , and a lasting delight that had consoled her through her final illness , around which Birnbaum had wandered helpless and alone . With Peter it had always been one thing , then another . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though Birnbaum carried in his mind , like a talisman , a vision of a time before the troubles began . <p> There had been business dealings gone bad , both their monies lost , when Peter was still in law school and bristled with schemes , plans for a golden future . There had been Peter 's first wife , not Jewish , and the sorrow that had caused  --  Birnbaum first rejecting her outright , then grieving in his heart that his life should have turned out this way , then later , before the ugly divorce , wanting from her some kind of expiation , a key to what had happened between them all . There had been Peter 's flirtation with a muddled New Age Christianity , crystals , herbs  --  drugs probably ( who knew ? ) , drinking certainly . There was his slovenly emotional life ( he behaved like an aggrieved child ) , his refusal , after his marriage fell apart , to complete law school and get his life on track . And there had been the pain the boy caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained silent , though he knew , Peter did , saw it on her face and in her sinking spirits . That he knew and still did not , at least for her sake , become a man , Birnbaum could not forgive him . <p> But now she was dead , and Birnbaum was old . He felt the circle of his life drawing to a close ; and his son , whatever his life was , was living it . So if they had not been in the same room for four years , still , what did they have , after all , but each other , and Birnbaum , this last time , was determined to try . And now , because of his crazy uncle Levine , he had the means . <p> The check had dropped out of the blue , a lightning bolt , a total surprise . It was starchy pink paper with a crosshatching of gray lines , the numbers embossed in light blue . Birnbaum sat on the sofa running his thumb again and again over the raised characters , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars . " <p> Schteiner , who had come home with him from the pool , sat dripping chlorinated sweat on Ruthie 's living room rug , searching among the papers on the table for an ashtray . <p> " My God , " Birnbaum said again . " Is it real ? " <p> Schteiner lit a cigarette , then took the check and held it to the light . He flicked it with a fingernail , put it to his nose . " Real , " he said . " One hundred percent . " <p> " What do I do with it ? " <p> " Do with it ? " Schteiner spoke through smoke . " You eat it . You let me take it in the kitchen and mix it in an omelet for you , with some tomato . " He looked at Birnbaum crosswise . He was a gray-skinned man with a large head and teeth that always showed . " Do with it , he says . Wake up , Birnbaum ! Your ship has come in , for God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the check up by his ear and shook it . " Twenty-five thousand ! " he said . " Dollars ! " With two fingers he pointed the cigarette at Birnbaum . " What do you do ? You go to Las Vegas , that 's what , you do n't wait , you just go , boom , good-bye ! Miami ! Paris , France ! Istanbul ! You meet a girl , a young foreign girl , extremely young . She loves you , and you marry her . Better yet , you do n't . There 's moonlight all over , Birnbaum , headwaiters , schnapps . There 's carriage rides , there 's opera  --  what you do n't know you 'll learn  --  there 's walks to put your spotty hand on glaciers . You live a little , that 's what . You do whatever you want after sixty years of wanting , that 's what you do . " He left for the kitchen to find an ashtray , shaking his head so that ashes flicked from the cigarette in his mouth first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your lucky day , you son of a bitch . Wake up and smell the danish . " <p> Birnbaum , who had seen his habits deteriorate  --  grow closer to Schteiner 's  --  in the months since Ruthie 's death , reached a near-empty tea glass with two cigarette stubs floating in it in Schteiner 's direction . Schteiner was n't looking . It impressed Birnbaum that after two years of friendship  --  if that 's what it was  --  Schteiner still looked for the ashtrays , as if Birnbaum smoked secretly , as if they had stocked up since yesterday . <p> Birnbaum sat in thongs , the plaid trunks and terrycloth jacket he 'd worn from the pool . The pool was in an apartment building where Schteiner knew some people  --  was there anyone he did n't know ?  --  and they had taken to going there every morning , sometimes again in the afternoon . Lately , Birnbaum had adopted Schteiner 's habit of not changing , just walking the six blocks with a towel over his shoulder . In late summer the sidewalks no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they walked not speaking much between small storefronts and gray stone apartments that seemed to sag , in their weariness , over the street . Schteiner was a man at the synagogue , something to do with contracting , always talking by the door , pumping hands , the last to leave . When he had showed up at the door one morning with a box of twenty-four doughnuts , Birnbaum , the rookie widower , not acknowledging his loneliness to himself , saw it in the other man 's face and let him in . Schteiner turned the radio on loud in the unnaturally quiet house , made dinner , a big chicken and four baked potatoes . Soon he was staying , stretching out on Ruthie 's striped couch under the afghan she had knitted , a cigarette like a tiny ship 's mast sticking out of his face , saying , " Get some sleep , Birnbaum . You look like what the cat dragged back out . " Today , when Birnbaum had wondered at the propriety of marching down Metropolitan Avenue in their swim shorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant all of a sudden ? Excuse me , Mr. Tyrone Power . Who 's looking at your skinny legs ? " <p> From the kitchen , drawers slamming , cabinets being opened . " First thing you do , " he heard Schteiner mutter , " is buy a goddamn ashtray . Then go to the Riviera , and good luck to you . " <p> Schteiner walked in from the kitchen , smiling with strong , snaggled teeth . He wore dark glasses and iridescent blue bathing trunks with fish circling back to front . On his head sat a powder-blue beret . " How about a nice glass'le tea ? " <p> While Schteiner banged pots , Birnbaum reread the letter that had come with the check . This lawyer in Toronto , McNeal , had the sad duty to report the passing of I. L. Levine , noted children 's author , at the age of eighty-nine , after long illness . In his effects , a codicil to the will had been found , indicating the enclosed check be inscribed . The delay was due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant relative of the deceased , after all . McNeal joined the entire Western reading world in expressing condolences . <p> It was true , Birnbaum and I. L. Levine , his mother 's uncle , could hardly have been called close . He had seen him twice in twenty years , the last time four years ago , when Ruthie and Birnbaum were in Toronto for a wedding . After the meal , though both were tired , they had accepted Levine 's invitation . In his dark apartment on the forty-eighth floor overlooking Lake Ontario , Levine 's girlfriend served them drinks , later tea and cake . The apartment was all view , which was impressive , glass walls everywhere revealing lighted buildings in the dark night like steamships , and behind them , endlessly , a deeper dark  --  the lake . On the interior walls , covers of the old man 's books , showing Hymie the Horse , who could turn into a trolley or a boat or an airplane in moments of danger to his children friends . There was a photo of Sharee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large ocean fish uncomfortably before her , something  --  blood ? dirt ?  --  attractively smudging her forehead . A pretty young woman who seemed eager to welcome Levine 's family into her home , Sharee did most of the talking , speaking in short , energetic bursts and then pausing , a hand in her long brown hair , hoping for a response , which Ruthie most often obliged her by supplying . She was a sweet girl , and Birnbaum tried not to wonder how she had ended up with an old dog like Levine . They talked about travel , shopping , Sharee 's major  --  interior design  --  at the university . Birnbaum sipped his drink and willed his eyes open . Levine did little talking . He drank steadily from the tumbler Sharee tended for him and watched her movements with a cold , unappeased hunger . A few times , it seemed to Birnbaum , he asked for something just so he , so they , could watch her cross the room , and once he turned to Birnbaum with a knowing nod , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of hips in a black skirt . He ignored Ruthie , who , if she minded , did n't show it and joined Sharee finally in the kitchen to help serve the cake . <p> " Twenty-two , " I. L. Levine said from his easy chair . " I found her at the university library , licking stamps . " <p> " A nice girl , " Birnbaum said . <p> " Nice ! " Levine shouted . " Not too nice ! Do n't you worry about that ! " <p> He rose and carried his tumbler into his study . When Birnbaum followed him in , he closed the door . In here , just one picture of Hymie , Levine on a movie set next to an actor in a big purple horse costume , both laughing , the actor 's white teeth visible through the soft set of Hymie 's felt choppers . Citations on the wall , pictures of Levine on daises shaking hands , lecturing , hoisting glasses . Levine among ecstatic children , reading , boys and girls crowded close , climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he would be shown a new manuscript , perhaps . He sat on a red leather chair and waited . Behind the desk , Levine rummaged in a drawer . All evening Levine had watched Sharee with bright eyes , speaking hardly at all , except to interrupt some of her remarks with a bark of laughter . He was old , Birnbaum could not have said how old , and all energy seemed to have pooled in those eyes , which moved like distant lights in his mottled , collapsing face . <p> " I 've been watching you , " Levine said . He produced a lacquered wood box and passed it over , the raptorial eyes fastening now on Birnbaum and making him uneasy . " I thought you might enjoy something special . " <p> The lid of the box was painted with oriental characters , trees , waterfalls , and slid noiselessly out of grooves on either side . Birnbaum looked at Levine , who smiled and nodded again . Birnbaum placed the lid on the floor . Inside , in red velvet , lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bun by wooden pins . She wore an embroidered black robe , had tiny ruby lips and closed eyes . She seemed almost real , lying with arms crossed as if sleeping . She was beautiful , Birnbaum thought , looking up uneasily at I. L. Levine . The old man came around the desk faster than Birnbaum had seen him move all night . " No , you fool , " he said , and pushed a knob Birnbaum had not noticed at the side of the box . Immediately , there was movement  --  the embroidered robe shot open , and the doll 's naked legs spread wide . Her arms flew into the the air in stiff , almost childlike , invitation , revealing tiny , perfectly contrived breasts , nipples , belly , pubic area . Her mouth formed a wide O as the eyes , a deep green glass , floated under languorous half-opened lids . <p> Levine , shouting his throaty laugh , pushed the button again for Birnbaum , then one more time , the doll transforming in Birnbaum 's lap , the arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit , then stood smiling before his guest , who over his shoulder could hear the women laying out dishes and talking softly in the living room . <p> " Lucky bastard , " Schteiner was saying from the kitchen , where he was searching for cakes to go with the tea . He appeared in the doorway with a box of graham crackers . " First , you get some better cookies , you know ? A little strudel would n't kill you , some assorted pastries . " He shook a cracker at Birnbaum , sending a shower of crumbs to the carpet , then turned back into the kitchen . " You can buy you a baker , a live-in , from France , a little girl baker in short skirts to bake cakes for you all day long . " He appeared again with two glasses of tea , thick slices of lemon , and broken graham crackers , on one of Ruthie 's trays . Another cigarette was in his mouth . He grinned at Birnbaum over the food . " Lucky bastard . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloud cover . Droplets of water trailed in jittery lines across the tiny plastic window , and Birnbaum thought of the heart monitor in Ruthie 's hospital room and turned away . <p> It was a new plane , the blue-and-orange brocade on the seats clean and unworn . The uniforms Connie and her comrades wore were crisp and freshly laundered blue , and the seat controls on his armrest , which Birnbaum touched but did not try , were tight plastic blisters , pleasing to the fingers . The walls were a seashell pattern , barely visible , meant to soothe , and the wing , the tip of which he could see , gleamed dully , slicing without apparent effort through the sudden scuds of cloud . He looked up the cabin at the odd , singular geometry of a plane in flight , angling on some vector a computer has decreed , the heads in ordered rows before him , the luggage racks minutely vibrating , voices in conversation , and under it all the throbbing drone of the engines , plowing them through limitless sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall it . <p> The woman beside him still stared at the seatback before her , so intently that Birnbaum looked again at the blue material to see what she might be seeing . She had a book in her hand  --  he could n't make out the cover  --  and reading glasses on a string around her neck , but she had n't turned a page yet . As he watched , Birnbaum saw tiny flickers in her cheek as her jaw muscles worked underneath . A tremor seemed to start up in one of her hands . Cosmopolitan and Vogue were on the seat between them , and Birnbaum wondered if she was offended by what he 'd said . " Who is this lady ? " he heard himself think . " Who made her judge over me ? " He noticed the beginnings of an active dislike in his chest . He flicked out one sleeve of his Italian jacket , located a piece of lint to remove . His bladder was full , and the captain had just announced they were free to move about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been nice , sweet and tingly at the same time . He wanted to compliment Connie  --  another drink and , yes , some time to read one of the magazines before he tried to sleep . But before rudely pushing past her to the aisle , Birnbaum decided , for politeness ' sake , to try conversation one more time . He turned in his seat , maneuvered his hat directly over the blonde on the cover of Cosmopolitan . He waited to give her a chance to notice . <p> " Vacation ? " he asked . <p> The woman did not respond at first . Then she turned her white head slowly , with a smile so thinly stretched across her face that Birnbaum felt rage jump in his belly . <p> " No , " she quietly said . <p> " I 'm visiting my son , " Birnbaum offered , thinking she can hear me out no matter what . " He 's in sales . Outside Portland . Automobile parts . " <p> The thin smile did not waver . He thought he 'd seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Some religious nut or grandmother to thirty boys in a military school . Some dried-up old nag who thought her troubles , whatever they were , entitled her to look down on everyone she met . Ruthie had a way of talking to such snobs . She could talk to anyone , but not Birnbaum . He plowed grimly on . <p> " I called last night , midnight . I 'm coming , I said , meet me at the airport . Just like that . Gave them a nice shock , I 'm sure . " <p> The woman now remembered the book in her lap . She carefully adjusted the reading glasses across her ears and began flipping pages . <p> " Just like that , " Birnbaum repeated . " Meet me at the Portland International Airport , 12:45 tomorrow . Do n't worry about work , I said , take the day off . " <p> Birnbaum leaned forward a bit to see the woman 's book cover . A long-haired man in a torn white pirate 's shirt embraced a reclining woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's got a nerve , Birnbaum thought , looking at his hat . He had the sudden , vivid urge to grab one of the flaccid arms that hung in her thin pink sweater and give it a good shake . <p> " That 's what I said . Do n't ask questions , just be at the airport , 12:45 . The rest you leave to me . " He lowered his tone confidentially . " I 've got a surprise . They have no idea . A trip . Wherever they want . Hawaii . Mexico . Disneyland . I 've got the tickets right here in my pocket . " The woman did n't look , but she seemed to pause in her reading . Birnbaum pulled his jacket open . " Five vouchers , they call them . Look , I asked them special to make them up like tickets . " He pointed at the destination line . " See ? Anywhere you want to go . Anyplace . It 'll knock their heads off , you wait , " and with a laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companionable jab in the shoulder . She did turn now , the look on her face so flat , so full of anger and determined disapproval , Birnbaum was stunned . He sat back . <p> " I 've never been west of Chicago , " he heard himself say without any idea why . <p> The woman returned to her reading , and Birnbaum immediately tried to stand , forgetting to undo his seatbelt . Then , in his haste to get out , he stumbled and placed his hand flat on his new fedora , crushing it . " Excuse me , " he said , " bathroom , " and not looking at the woman , he pushed past her legs into the aisle . <p> At first the doctors did not know what caused Ruthie 's symptoms . And what were they , really  --  aches , cramping , fatigue  --  in a woman her age ? Birnbaum did not like to recall this time , though it was the last he would really have of her , before the medicines , then the doctors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him unbearably sad to remember how , with the diagnosis undetermined and his wife in pain , he had prodded her to put it out of her mind , where he insisted it originated , and pay a little more attention to him , with his back pain real , God knew , and his bursitis and the rest . She had tried , making them dinners to eat in front of the TV , reminding him to eat his salad . But when she would invariably fall asleep , head sagging over her full plate , she looked old , beyond weary , and Birnbaum , frightened , would see the sickness the doctors could n't in her face . He would wash their dishes , then nudge her softly and tell her it was time to go upstairs . <p> Then one night he awoke , and Ruthie was not in bed . He understood , dimly , she had been gone a long time . Half-asleep , he called to her , realized she was in the bathroom , had been calling his name . He reached for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the bathroom his wife sat on the toilet , her nightgown hiked up , a pink towel from the rack held between her legs . What he remembered most was the towel , a fluffy towel she liked to wrap around her head in a turban after bathing , stuffed between her legs on the toilet . And her smile . " I think we 'd better call Dr. Melman , " she said , quietly , and then , looking at him , no doubt reading the fear on his face , she had smiled . " Go on , Murray , " she said . " I 'm all right here . " Sitting on her side of the bed near the phone , he 'd seen the blood pooling on the mattress . It glistened dully in the light from the streetlamp , and he did n't need to touch it to know what it was . That was the moment his life changed . He sat on their bed , alone , and waited for the doctor at the other end of the wire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end , they moved in a small bed for him to stay with her . Right until the last day , the last hour , no one talked about dying , not actual death . She was ill , certainly . The disease had spread , encamped all over her body . The bleeding had stopped , but the cancer had been merely held at bay for a time . It would win , yes , but not yet , surely not so soon . So she spoke to Peter on the phone , and they made plans for another visit once she got out of the hospital . This time , Birnbaum would come along . She laughed about the baby and gave advice and talked to their little grandson , Daniel , about his dog , Barney , and when she handed the phone to Birnbaum he could barely speak , so full of anger was he that here was this woman , this saint , severely ill , in constant pain , and across the continent , their failed son complained to her about diaper rash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsleeping . He remembered the night of their wedding , forty years earlier . The rings had been given , the glass shattered , the prayers uttered , and the cake cut . Now was the moment the couple were to be alone . Ruthie went first , parting the heavy gray curtain that revealed a wooden door . Birnbaum was delayed , talking to some teary aunt , and when he finally got away , pushed the door open with a shoulder , there Ruthie sat , on a chair by a table , holding two small wineglasses . In the old days , this was the moment for the couple to consummate their marriage . But Birnbaum had no thought of that . It had been a long , tiring day , the effort of being happy in public for so many hours as trying to him as the small bickerings among family about food , seating , who knew what . He eased the door closed behind him . All he really wanted was to sit near her , his wife now , for a quiet moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind future . He turned to Ruthie . Wax from the candles they had held in the procession shone bluely from one of her shoes . Birnbaum 's pack of cigarettes lay on the table , by the glasses , by the yellow flowers Ruthie had just put down . She faced him in her white dress , the veil he had lifted moments ago flowing back over her dark hair . Wife . She held her arms out to him and smiled , and Birnbaum walked slowly toward this vision in white , toward everything he had ever dreamed of having . <p> He was slapped from memory by the sound of voices , machinery . Two doctors were pulling the covers off Ruthie ; a nurse was pushing a red cart to the bed . A silver box was by her feet , a nurse hurriedly rubbing two paddles together . Alarms beeped from the wall , more doctors came in , and a nurse tried to close the curtain around Ruthie 's bed , but Birnbaum 's cot was in the way . He stood , working his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He watched the monitor over her head , through the bodies and arms , through the noise of machines and the doctors ' orders growing more severe , trying , though the nurse still held him , to catch a glimpse of his wife 's face . <p> Before last night , Birnbaum had not spoken with his son in nearly half a year . The last time ended so badly , the two of them screaming into the phone , that it had taken this long for the healing . On both sides there were outrages . Birnbaum was ready to acknowledge this  --  no relationship was perfect . Yet even at Ruthie 's funeral , Peter arrived late , after the services , to stand behind the last row of mourners at the grave-site , not up front with Birnbaum where he belonged . Bessie , Ruth 's aunt , who would n't know her own business if it had a sign around its neck , walked over to Birnbaum after they had thrown the handfuls of dirt  --  crying , nearly coming apart with tears , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry , as if it were n't his Ruthie in the cold ground . " Talk to him , " she said . " Murray , look at him . Today 's not a day for fighting . " <p> Birnbaum had been willing . He took a last breath , looked at the white pine coffin nearly obscured now by shovelfuls of dirt , and let Bessie walk him over to where his son , long hair and leather jacket  --  who still dressed this way at thirty-five ?  --  wet from the rain , stood wanly by a tree , smoking . As they approached , Birnbaum was ready to do anything , cry , laugh , throw his arms around the boy , anything . His Ruthie lay there in a box ; she was not coming back . All he and Peter had left was each other . Was n't it her final wish they be reconciled ? Is n't this what Birnbaum prayed for each night , his mouth full of bitterness and regret ? He would embrace the boy , take him home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and Bessie came close , he saw Peter 's face . Not on it the need for comfort , the contrition Birnbaum expected , but that look so particularly Peter 's  --  quiet outrage , detachment , the aloof expectation of pain . In that pale , tearless face , closed down on its own sorrow , Birnbaum saw all his disappointment , all that he had every right to expect from life and would never , he saw it again now , would never receive from it . A few feet from Peter they crossed a path , and Birnbaum turned down it , rage tinting his vision red , Bessie 's heavy feet tramping the wet ground behind him , her calling , " Wait , Murray , I ca n't walk so fast . " <p> Now , on the plane , Birnbaum reflected quietly that any hardship in this world is easier to bear than a disappointing child . He asked God about this in his prayers , requested guidance , solace . After prolonged self-examination he had determined that , like all fathers , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He prayed in private to his God of sad retribution , asked , politely , for miracles . In early mornings after sleepless nights in the big bed he cursed God from the bottom of his aching heart , and God , in his heedless , unending silence , seemed to curse him back . <p> His appetite ruined by heartburn , Birnbaum watched the lady next to him pick four tiny shrimp one by one off a bed of green pasta and tear at them with small front teeth . Her meticulous movements dipped him in a melancholy he could smell . He tried to read an article in Cosmopolitan about the sixth marriage of a beauty queen from the ' 40s and , still reading , fell asleep . He dreamed of flying in an airplane , of blue fish swimming through the aisle . He dreamed Connie was in the seat next to him , laughing at something he 'd said , leaning toward him in a green dress to take hold of his arm . He saw himself and Ruthie running before the waves on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tossing a beret back and forth . He dreamed of being in a box , lying on velvet , turning into a warm embrace ; then the box was being lowered and he could n't get his breath . All light was gone . <p> He awoke several times , his face pressed against the cold window , once to accept a blanket from Connie , once to wipe his cheek , which had become wet . The woman next to him slept , too , and the cabin was darkened , at last , for night . A young couple across the aisle held each other under a blanket . Their eyes were closed , but the blanket moved and the boy was smiling . Outside the window six silver dolphins kept pace with the plane , skimming through heavy gray water . When he awoke again , the pilot was announcing their descent into Portland . He brushed stiff fingers through his hair , was surprised to be in daylight . The woman beside him was trussed in her seatbelt , immobile eyes trained forward . He picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outside , rain fell in fringes on a landscape startlingly green and lush , and white birds flew on long wings toward the tree line on the far bank of a river . <p> They were there , the four of them , as Birnbaum , still groggy , emerged into the waiting area . Janine held the boy in her arms and made him wave  --  or maybe he waved himself , Birnbaum could n't tell  --  while Peter , with the baby to the side , found an ashtray for his cigarette . Janine came up through the crowd . They embraced , the shoulders of Janine 's and Daniel 's jackets still wet with rain , and Birnbaum felt confused by emotion , tried to shake the remnants of dreaming from his head . The little boy called him " Grandpop , " and immediately put his small warm hand in Birnbaum 's . Peter walked over , eyes scrunched as if smoke still bothered him . " Well , you made it , " he said , and held up the baby , asleep , for Birnbaum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your granddaughter . " <p> Birnbaum was n't sure if Peter meant for him to take the child . He was willing , just let him put down his bag . " She 's beautiful , " he said . <p> Peter nodded , as if this was what he had come over to hear . He turned and began walking with the crowd toward the baggage area . Watching him , Birnbaum felt a familiar mourning bloom , loss fingering his throat from the inside . He swallowed it down with the smile he 'd been practicing all day . " Well , " he said to Daniel , " how 's my biggest grandson ? " <p> The boy looked first at his mother . " I 'm your only grandson . " <p> " Yes , " Birnbaum said . " And the smartest . " The boy glanced at him a moment , puffed his cheeks in exasperation . He began dragging Birnbaum by the hand , as if to turn him around . <p> " Daniel , " Janine said quietly . She felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , the smile still there . " You turn over a new leaf ? " <p> " I bought some clothes for myself . " <p> " Nice , " she said . " No offense , but I never thought I 'd be out-dressed by my father-in-law . " <p> The airport was smaller , quieter than New York , the carpeting a cheerful blue-green with staccato dashes of red and orange . Illuminated photographs on the walls showed vast green pastures , placid lakes , unimposing mountains . Outside the windows were rain and fog , and on the way to baggage claim Daniel pulled on Birnbaum 's hand and they stopped . A jet was taking off , careening through its own roar until , nose up , it lifted off the runway . " Look , Grandpop , " the boy said . They watched until the plane banked and turned out of sight in the mist . Daniel was a light-skinned , round-faced boy , with brown hair just now losing curls he 'd had as a baby . Looking at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of himself around the eyes . The boy held onto his hand , and Birnbaum felt emotion working loose in his chest . Aiming for jauntiness , he said to Janine , " I called my grandfather Zeide , but where would Daniel hear such a word out here ? " Janine laughed , showing pretty teeth . " He calls my father Grandpop . This is your other grandpop , right , Daniel ? " " Right ! " the boy said , marching forward with Birnbaum in tow . " You got that one ! " <p> Realizing he had forgotten presents for the children , Birnbaum spotted a gift shop and said to the boy , " Who likes chocolate ? " " Me , " Daniel said , stopping and pointing at his thin chest . His arms were so skinny , Birnbaum thought . Do they feed him well ? " I do . I like chocolate . " Peter walked ahead , and Birnbaum bought from the woman behind the counter a large , gaily wrapped chocolate bar that read " Welcome to Oregon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in back with the boy , who was small for his age , Birnbaum noted , and who occupied a carseat by his sister 's , though he was nearly five . The boy sang a song about a rabbit in the forest and offered some of the chocolate to his grandfather . Birnbaum declined , and soon the bar was melted and the boy 's face smeared as he chewed with browned teeth and sang . When Janine handed Birnbaum a tissue , he did what he could and thought for the first time since getting off the plane of Ruthie , how she would have been taking care of the boy , would have brought tissues of her own , would be shaking her head at him for the notion of chocolate before lunch . <p> They left the airport and drove south . Mist hovered low over fields on both sides of the highway , full green in the middle of winter . Trees were vague shapes in the distance , and occasional stolid sheep or cows stood unmoving in the grass . From a high wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned in his seat to see more , though no one else in the car seemed to pay any mind . The whole countryside was shrouded , dampened , mute , and Birnbaum felt the unease of the dream returning . Far ahead , sun seemed to be agitating the fog , which parted here and there , revealing layers of gray and blue cloud , brightening toward light . <p> " So , " Janine said , turning to face him , " tell us about the flight . " She always had been pretty , with Daniel 's wide forehead and clear brown eyes . As she smiled , creases gathered around her mouth and eyes , and Birnbaum , surprised , wondered if she could be aging already , then thought it might be sleeplessness , the new baby . <p> " What 's to tell ? " he said . " A plane is a plane . You get on , you sit , you get off in Portland , Oregon , another country from Queens entirely . " <p> " You 've never been out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remembering the woman on the plane , shook his head . <p> " Well , I hate flying , " Janine said , looking over at Peter . " I know it 's silly . It just makes me nervous . " <p> She paused to give Peter a chance to join in the conversation , but he kept silent , his eyes on the road . She looked briefly at Birnbaum , who looked away and lifted Daniel 's head back into the carseat . The boy had fallen asleep , and his head had rolled forward onto his chest . <p> " This was a new plane , brand new , " he said . " You would have liked this one , Peter . Actually very comfortable . " He went on , trying to fill the small car with his voice . " But they put me next to a dragon lady , a real monster . An old woman , what God did to her I would n't want to think about . Angry ? Unfriendly ? My God . Peter , you remember Landau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like her exactly , only more of the same . " <p> Peter , who still had not spoken , leaned forward to push the lighter . He rolled down his window a few inches , letting in the cold . <p> " Sorry about the rain , " Janine said . " That 's Oregon for you . " <p> " What 's a little rain ? " Birnbaum said . " Do n't be sorry . " <p> Peter lit a cigarette , the smoke dancing briefly in the air before whipping out the window . He held the cigarette close to the filter and sucked it with a sound that made Birnbaum squirm . The boy 's head had fallen forward again , and Birnbaum did what he could , then laid his hand on the boy 's in his lap . He smiled at Janine . <p> " He 's tired , " she said . " All the excitement . " " Sure , " Birnbaum said . <p> They drove south , tracing the curve of a gray river . Birnbaum saw more waterfalls bursting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponds the size of small lakes in a few . A large brown bird  --  a hawk , Birnbaum guessed , he really had no idea  --  lifted slowly off a fence-post , and something  --  a cat ? a fox ?  --  chased after it lazily . He was chilled from the open window , tired too , the unnamable emotion he had been feeling all day welling again . He checked the sheaf of vouchers in his jacket pocket . <p> Birnbaum looked at the back of his son 's head , small-seeming , despite the rough Army-jacket green , the skull flattened under lank brown hair . He missed Ruthie now , acutely , her presence in this silent car . Peter had been a sorrow to her , too  --  what dreams they 'd had for the boy !  --  but she could talk to him , she could always do that , and with her there as mediator , they had done all right . She could see the hurt behind the hurtful things said . She could see love where he and Peter , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and touch their son 's hair , might make a gentle joke about how long it was , a gesture Birnbaum could not consider making . As if sensing his father watching him , Peter moved , flicked his stub out the window and punched the lighter for another cigarette . Birnbaum reached over and squeezed Janine 's shoulder instead . <p> " Good to see you , " he said . <p> " You , too , Murray , " she said . " Good to see you , too . " <p> Their house was a green bungalow carved low into a hillside . Although it did not seem new , piles of black dirt sat to the sides , fresh-looking , as if the hill were slowly reclaiming its domain , and above the house , behind it , trees trailed away in the light rain . A boy 's bicycle lay on the lawn , a dimpled red kickball , what appeared to be a motorcycle under a tarp , car tires , wheel hubs . To one side , in a carport , a dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , engine suspended above it on a winch . A short man in a greasy workshirt and baseball cap scraped inside the engine with a screwdriver . He paused as they got out of the car , raised a bandanna at Birnbaum and smiled . There was a fierce scratching at the door , and Daniel ran to let Barney , his golden retriever , out into the yard . The dog ran directly at Birnbaum , ears and teeth in the wind , scaring him , but after trying to put muddy paws on Birnbaum 's jacket to get at his face , the dog was pushed away hard by Peter . Daniel , with shrieks of delight , chased the excited dog into the driveway , where he hugged his neck and pulled out the remaining chocolate to share . <p> While Janine carried the baby indoors and Peter unloaded the luggage , Birnbaum stood on the grass verge of the property and looked around . Up the street , more bungalows built into the hillside , small frame houses across the way , each with a stretch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was so moist that even at midday little wisps of fog curled above the far houses . Birnbaum took a step toward the carport , cleared his throat . <p> " Hello , " he said . " Tell me , does it ever get dry here ? " <p> The man in the workshirt was twisting a wrench around a lug in the engine . He stopped and looked at Birnbaum . He was short , losing his hair , with a large belly and muscular arms . He had a friendly smile . " Yeah , " he said . " Sometimes it does . " <p> Peter came out from the house and joined the man . They both turned to the engine and began talking . <p> Birnbaum waited by the car . In him , despite his refusal to acknowledge it , the distinct wish to get away , to run  --  here he was n't familiar , maybe not even welcome . What had he been thinking ? In this green house his son lived out a life Birnbaum did n't know , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , that he 'd carried in his mind across the continent , circled him , dim in outline but vivid in detail  --  the five of them , he and his children , in a sunlit place , full of color , walking eagerly toward sounds of some festive gathering , laughter , music , lighthearted conversation . His new shoes darkening with wet , he watched this plan fade in mist above the house . He would leave . They would understand . A mistake . At the airport , he could sit in the lounge and feed quarters to the TV until a plane came to take him home . Schteiner would be there . They would eat , maybe go down to the boulevard and watch the old fellows play chess . Birnbaum had a confused image of Schteiner answering the door in Ruthie 's dressing gown , ashes dribbling down the front . Then Daniel and the dog came tearing into the front yard , the boy skidding in the grass with his hands on the dog 's collar to keep him grounded . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , Janine called , " Murray , what are you doing out there ? Peter , your father 's standing in the rain ! " Peter and the man by the car looked over their shoulders at Janine . The man smiled . Janine said , " Daniel , ask your grandfather in , for heaven 's sake . " <p> The boy ignored her . " Wan na see my swing set , Grandpop ? You have to come with us . This minute , c'm on . " Daniel let go of the dog , who galloped around the side of the house . The boy said , " Grownups ca n't ride , but they can look . C'm on , " and led Birnbaum to the back . <p> Inside , the house was as depressing as Birnbaum feared it would be . It was clean , for which he credited Janine , but cluttered without being cozy , the furniture worn , faded , the rooms smelling of the damp , of baby and dog . The carpeting was a gold , abraded gray where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paneling even Birnbaum could tell was imitation . Nowhere were signs of Peter 's law books , or the framed diploma Ruthie and Birnbaum had presented him after his college graduation . Nowhere a mezuzah , a prayer book  --  whose child was this ? Instead , a large , greasy toolbox in one corner , the metal innards of a motor piled next to it on some newspaper . <p> On the mantel , birth pictures of the children , creased paperback novels , a wedding photo , Peter shyly grinning in a light blue suit , Janine in a simple dress , darker blue . The wedding had taken place shortly after Peter came home to tell them he planned to marry Janine . He 'd come to ask forgiveness , relinquishing long before hopes of their blessing . They had been invited , but Birnbaum remembered spending that day planting bulbs in the backyard , ignoring Ruthie 's occasional tears by gouging savage holes in the wet spring ground , reaching over his shoulder to receive the bulbs without looking his wife in the face . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby bottle , while above it , on the wall , a couple smiled toothily from a wooden porch swing  --  Janine 's parents , he assumed . <p> " Sorry for the mess , " Janine said , once she put the baby down . " Kids . But I do n't have to tell you . " <p> " What mess ? " Birnbaum said . " It 's comfortable , I 'd call it . " <p> Peter walked in , wiping his hands on a rag . " That damn engine 's taking a lot longer than I thought . " His glance grazed Birnbaum in passing , settled on Janine . " I told Parker I 'd have it done by today . " <p> " Ca n't you call him ? " Janine said through a bright smile . <p> " Yeah , " Peter said , throwing the rag by the toolchest . " I can call him . " He went into the next room . <p> " He works hard , " Birnbaum said . <p> " Yes , " Janine said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A temporary thing , till I get back to my job at the bank . " <p> " What about law school ? " Birnbaum asked . " Does he talk about it ? " <p> " Oh , Murray . Not much , " she said , glancing toward the kitchen , where they could hear Peter and Daniel discussing the boy 's lunch . " We do n't really talk about it that much anymore . " <p> " After two years , he was in the top five percent . This was NYU , one of the top schools . " <p> " I know , Murray , " Janine said . <p> Peter walked back in the room . " He wo n't go for it . Says I 've had it a week already . If I ca n't get it done today , he 'll send a truck over to haul it away . " <p> " Peter , " Janine said . " Your father just got here . " <p> " I know , " he said . " I 'm doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel said , " This bread tastes funny . " <p> " Just eat it ! " Peter said . He muttered a curse under his breath and went back outside . The door slammed , and Birnbaum and Janine sat and listened to the men talk . Birnbaum 's mouth ached . He looked at the musty brown couch as if he would lie down on it , shoes and all . " He ca n't stay in the same room , " he said quietly . <p> " Sit , " Janine said , motioning to the couch . She smiled tightly . " He has to work , Murray . We 'll all be together at dinner . " <p> She came out in a few moments with a tray , and Birnbaum saw she had made tea , remembering he liked it in a glass , with lemon . She sat and began cutting into a frosted coffee cake . She smiled at him wearily . She had grown older , Birnbaum decided , this woman he never got to know . One trip to meet them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To him she had seemed  --  sitting shyly in their living room , the only one laughing at his desperate jokes  --  another threat , one more signal that his life , so meagerly lit , was about to get darker still . She had thick auburn hair , pulled back in a bow on her neck . Her face was wide and open , and Birnbaum guessed it expressed emotions directly , the way a pond reflects light or turbulence . He admired her warily , from a distance . She had always been kind to him and Ruthie , even when he and Peter could not talk . Watching her , Birnbaum searched for what he wanted to say , what he felt , as if he had a note somewhere in a pocket he 'd forgotten . He searched for friendship , kindly affection , and was surprised to find , instead , fear . <p> " Janine , " he said , the word sounding strange in his ears  --  he realized he had never used it . She had always been " she " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Still cutting the cake , Janine indicated she was listening . " I wanted to say , all that trouble , the wedding , the fights ... " She looked up and shook her head . He went on . " It was n't you . I wanted to say this . It was never you . It was family , religion , it was many things , but not you . You 're a good woman , a fine wife , I can see that . I know Ruth would want , if she was here , to say the same thing . " <p> " She did , Murray , " Janine said . <p> " What ? " <p> " Last winter , when she was here . We talked all about it . " She smiled again . " You do n't need to say any more . " <p> " She did n't tell me . " <p> " She was a wonderful woman , Murray . You must miss her terribly . " " Yes . " Birnbaum sat back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt . She explained a lot . I thanked her . We spent a lot of time talking . " <p> " And Peter ? " <p> " Peter , too . It was a good visit . " <p> " So much anger , all the time he 's so angry , I ca n't even talk . " <p> " I know . " <p> " Me , too . Angry , for years ... " <p> From the kitchen , the raucous blaring of the TV , a rasp of canned laughter . Daniel , bored with lunch , had turned on the set . <p> " Too loud , honey , " Janine called . The volume decreased . Janine bent over the table and put a piece of cake on a glass plate , which she handed to Birnbaum with a small fork and a linen napkin . <p> Birnbaum thanked her and took a sip of tea . This was not a day he could understand . Why had Ruthie never spoken with him ? There had been months , all those days at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was unfair of her , and Birnbaum , for the first time , was annoyed at his wife , who had carried this away , along with the secret she had always possessed of talking to their son , had gone silently to her grave , and left him , ever more alone , to find his way . <p> He realized he was not eating the cake . He chewed a piece and reminded himself to taste . " Excellent cake , " he said . " Did you make it ? " <p> Janine shook her head , a small color rising in her face . <p> " No , we stopped at the store on the way to the airport . " <p> " It 's good . I have a friend at home should try it . He 's got an obsession with cakes . " <p> Janine looked up at him . Behind her , a heater in the wall sighed heavily , and warm air smelling of earth filled the room . <p> " I 'm glad you came to see us . Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " <p> They drank the tea , finished the cake in silence . From the kitchen the TV droned , and Daniel spoke to the characters , to Barney . " Do n't do that , silly . Barney , tell Wile E. Coyote . " And from outside , the men working , sounds of strain , of metal being gouged . After a few moments they heard a truck start up , and Peter walked in . <p> " Keith 's gone to the Napa for parts , " he said , picking up the rag he 'd tossed and wiping his hands again . He straightened , loosed a small smile at his wife . " Any cake left ? " <p> " Sure , " Janine said . " Sit . I 'll get a plate . " <p> Peter sat opposite his father on a nubbled white easy chair . " So , " he said . " How 's the house ? " <p> " Good , " Birnbaum said . " Big . My friend Schteiner 's been staying . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health ? How 's the shoulder ? " <p> " OK . A little bit so-so . " <p> " Janine asks about the garden . She remembers Mom 's garden from our visit . " <p> " It 's still there , " Birnbaum said . " I pull out the weeds ; I try to keep it trimmed . " <p> Janine came in with a fresh glass of tea , a plate for Peter . " I loved that garden , " she said . " It must have taken years to grow . " <p> Birnbaum nodded . As they sat , he remembered all the days Ruthie would come in from the yard , flushed , smeared with dirt and loam , but happy , exhausted . She would tell him of the irises , the tulips , the flowering shrubs , and he would listen , half-bored , enjoying her animation . He looked at his son , remembering when the yard had been his , many years back . Peter had lost weight , was wiry , roughened . He seemed actually larger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his face  --  maybe it was just today  --  was thin , withdrawn , with a haggard look behind all that hair . He was no longer a handsome man , Birnbaum thought . Some people simply do n't age well . <p> " Well , " Janine said , " what 's the secret ? " <p> They looked at her . <p> " Oh , come on . " She laughed . " New clothes , fancy haircut , surprise visit . You must have something up your sleeve , Murray . " <p> Birnbaum looked at Peter . His son was looking at him , too , it seemed , with interest . He got up and went to one of his bags , which Peter had laid near the door , and pulled out a large manila envelope . His head was burning , and he could n't seem to shake the chill in his bones . He wondered if he was coming down with something , remembered Schteiner sneezing wetly into a hand towel all morning . <p> He sat back at the coffee table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color , with bright letters and exclamation points , they announced a world of pleasure and utter ease  --  beaches , skyscrapers , mountain vistas ending in cloud , Old World cobbled squares with cathedrals and picturesque natives in costume , tropical fruit and foliage , young people everywhere at play . He laid these , along with the vouchers , on the table before them . <p> " What 's all this ? " Janine said . <p> " A trip , " Birnbaum said . <p> " A trip ? For who ? " <p> " For you . For us . " He tried to explain . " I came into some money . Peter , you remember Levine , the writer ? " <p> Peter picked up two brochures , looked at them in his hand , did not respond . <p> " A relation of mine , " Birnbaum said to Janine , " an old man , passed away . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " she said , looking from one man to the other . <p> " We were n't close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sum of cash . I 'm alone now ; I find I do n't need as much as I thought . " He fingered a brochure of some island in the sun . A bronze giant of a woman in a tiara of flowers beamed at him . " I find it difficult , some days , to fill the time . " Schteiner suddenly traipsing through his mind , trailing chlorine and cigarette smoke into Ruthie 's rooms . His head felt filled with sand . At the airport he would phone Schteiner . A mistake . Peter opened a brochure , dropped it back on the table , opened the second . Birnbaum looked at Janine . " A vacation , " he said , reaching for his tea . He took a sip , sucking breathily . " I thought maybe we could travel someplace together . " <p> " But where ? " Janine said . She had opened one of the vouchers . " These do n't have a destination . " <p> " You fill in , " he said . " Anywhere " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Janine was smiling , yes , but Birnbaum had expected more ; something was to happen . That feeling from the plane , a lightness in the chest , a heaviness in the throat and head , enfolded him . " Anyplace , " he said . " Where would you like to go ? " <p> " Murray , " Janine said . " I do n't believe it . Let me get Daniel . " <p> She went into the kitchen . This was not how he had pictured it , the telling , and weariness contended with disappointment in his mind . He had envisioned them around a table , the three of them , a cloth-covered table in a different house , spacious , well-lit , maybe a bottle of wine or champagne , even , to mark the moment . The plates , still holding good food , are spread before them , candles , music from a nearby room , his new granddaughter asleep in his lap . Scattered among the serving dishes are brochures , dreams come to life , all the colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a simple toast , " To good times " ; there are murmurs of approval , kindly protestations . He soothes the sleeping child in his lap . Then , finally , afraid to , he looks at his son . <p> Daniel burst into the room , followed by the dog , who immediately ran to the door and put paws up on the lacerated wood , scratching . Daniel stopped in front of his grandfather , two sticky hands on the old man 's Italian slacks . " Mommy said we 're going to Disneyland ! Is that true ? " <p> " Would you like that ? " <p> " Of course , " the boy said . " That 's the best idea yet ! " <p> " Well , we 'll see what your father says , OK ? " <p> " Yippee ! " Daniel shouted . He ran to the door . The dog was gone through the broken screen door before the boy could get it open , and then Daniel was gone , too . <p> " Daniel ! " his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about letting Barney run off like that ? " <p> The boy came back . " Sorry , " he said . " I forgot . " <p> " Is it raining ? " <p> He looked behind him . " I guess so . " <p> " Do n't you think you should wear your coat ? " <p> The boy took his jacket off the hook by the door and ran into the yard . Birnbaum heard him tell the dog , " You be Pluto , Barney , I 'll be Mickey . " <p> They sat and looked at Peter . He folded the two brochures and put them back on the table . He leafed through the vouchers in their blue holders , examining each separately . Birnbaum watched his tea . <p> " What is all this ? " Peter said . <p> " Honey , " Janine said . <p> " What is it ? " Peter said to his father . <p> " A trip , " Birnbaum said . " A vacation , away from winter for a few days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought . Whenever . It does n't have to be right away . " " And you 've thought of everything ? " " Everything ? I do n't know ... . " <p> " You 've arranged babysitters , leave for me from the garage ? " Birnbaum looked at his tea , told himself to take a sip . " Did you call Janine 's bank and say she would be gone longer ? Is there in your magic pockets a mortgage payment on this mansion , winter clothes for the kids ? " <p> " Peter , your father 's trying ... " <p> Birnbaum pulled his coat closer , cold . It was time to go . Peter stood , Janine stood beside him , took one of his arms . Birnbaum looked briefly at his face , then away , to the side . <p> " What do you want ? " Peter said quietly . <p> Birnbaum did n't answer . <p> " What do you want here ? This is my house . I live here . My family lives here . Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Birnbaum spoke softly . " I thought I would be welcome . " <p> " What do you want ? " Birnbaum did n't understand . <p> " Tell me what you want , " Peter repeated . " What is it this time ? Am I raising my children wrong ? Have I married the wrong woman again ? Have your grandfathers been coming in the night and whispering about me ? Or is it the old indictment  --  I 'm not the son a man like you deserves . " <p> Birnbaum watched his tea . In the light from the window , small currents and updrafts moved in the copper liquid , fronds of steam waved from the glass and disappeared . <p> Janine tugged on Peter 's arm . " Peter , that 's enough . " <p> He shook her off . " No , Janine . This is the conversation we 've been having all my life ; it 's time for you to join in . Look at him , the doting parent , the kindly grandfather bearing gifts . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time ? " <p> Birnbaum put his hands on his knees . He would lie down here a moment , they would n't mind . Then a cab would take him back to the airport ; maybe Schteiner could meet him at LaGuardia . From his wounded shoulder , a cold hand reaching into his chest . In his mind , suddenly , an image of the High Holy Days as a child , sixty years ago , the cantor keening in misery and exultation , Birnbaum , a small boy , wrapped close under his grandfather 's prayer shawl , warm , smelling the old man 's fishy breath as they rocked together in the yellow light . " I came to be with family , " he said , " to see my son . " <p> Peter looked at him a moment , snorted . " Well , " he said . " Here we are . I work at Storey 's Automotive , and we 've got a new baby . I fix old cars for rich assholes . This is it , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where we live . Take a good look . " <p> The door opened , and Keith stuck his head in . He blinked twice , as if the light inside were too bright . <p> Peter took a step toward his father , then stopped . Birnbaum could see his hooded eyes , a few gray hairs in his beard . " Do n't let him fool you , " Peter said to Janine . " This is n't for us . It 's not about us , it 's about him . It 's always about him . " He stood there , looking down at Birnbaum . Keith came up to his side . Peter put a hand on Birnbaum 's shoulder . " You 're not wanted here , " he said , and began pulling his father up by his coat . <p> " Peter , " Birnbaum said . Janine walked quickly around the table . <p> " Hey , Pete , " Keith said . He put both hands on Peter 's chest . " I think we 're ready to drop that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . He released his father 's coat , put open hands in the air . They headed for the door . <p> " Hey , Keith , " Peter said , " you want to go to Disneyland ? " " Sure , man . Anything to get out of this rain . " <p> Birnbaum took off his shoes and pants , hung his shirt and jacket over the back of the single chair in Daniel 's room . A short bed with red , blue , and yellow dinosaur linen was made up for him . Four grinning , two-legged turtles in bandannas waved weapons at him from a poster . On the pillow were two plastic horses , one black with white feet and the other a dun with a gnawed tail . Daniel had said his grandfather could have these to sleep with while he used the room . Janine had pulled back the blue comforter , showed Birnbaum the mismatched towels and washcloth stacked neatly on the foot of the bed . He lay facing the wall , coveting sleep , but faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman on the plane ; Ruthie in bed those last few weeks , disappearing before his eyes , but calm , somehow , like the cat that got the canary ; Daniel , covered with chocolate ; and Peter , of course , looming over him , about to strike . He lay with eyes open , unable to halt the procession of faces . Then quickly , like a sudden undertow , weariness dragged these images from his mind . He pulled the fainthearted misery of this house over his shoulders with the comforter , rolled on his side , and dropped headlong into sleep . <p> Birnbaum sat in the chair by the window watching his grandson in the rain . Daniel had some toys , a purple dinosaur , a doll in a striped shirt Birnbaum associated vaguely with a children 's television show , a G.I. Joe in full combat attire . He lined these up by a shovel in the grass and walked before them , lecturing . Birnbaum could hear snippets of his high , emphatic voice . Barney , told repeatedly to sit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dolls in his mouth  --  especially the fat dinosaur that kept tipping soggily into its own lap  --  running to the street with his head shaking , then dropping the doll at his feet , looking back at the boy . Daniel would shout , " No , Barney ! Do you want a bad spanking ? " and eventually the dog would return . <p> He had been awakened from sleep by noises . He thought at first some animal had got under the bed , was scratching at the wall . Then he realized , dragged bodily from dreaming , he was hearing whispers through the thin wall , from Peter 's bedroom . They were arguing , trying to keep their voices down  --  especially Janine , straining to whisper , trying to get Peter to do the same . Birnbaum did not move . <p> Peter said , " I had to work , remember ? Or do n't we need the money all of a sudden he rolls in ? " <p> " I 'm sorry , Peter . Since when would n't Storey give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . " <p> " Good . Let him be scared . " <p> " Peter , he 's an old man . He 's your father . " <p> " You think I forget that ? You think there 's a minute I do n't know that ? " <p> " Peter . " <p> " Yeah ? And what is this Disneyland shit ? Martinique . Fucking Honolulu . Huh ? Drop in from the sky like some miracle rabbi and scoop us off to Disney-fucking-land ? " <p> " Peter , he 's asleep . " <p> " Calls in the middle of the night , drops out of the sky , pack your bags , we 're off to Disneyland . Fuck . " <p> And almost as if he could hear it coming , Birnbaum was moving before the hand struck the wall , a palm-open slap that he felt in his body . He heard , tried not to hear , movement in their bedroom , something , maybe a chair , falling over . <p> " He 'll hear you ! " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hear anything . Acts like God took my mother just to make him miserable . Who does he think killed her off ? " <p> " All right , that 's enough . " <p> " No . " Peter was no longer whispering , no longer shouting . His voice was changed , higher . He sounded like Daniel . " Does he see this place ? What does he think is going on here ? " <p> " OK , OK , " he heard her saying . " Shh . " <p> " Disneyland . How about Mars ? Two weeks at the beach in Atlantis ? " <p> " Oh-kay , " and she was whispering again , the first syllable drawn out , the second falling like a caress . Then someone was crying , and Birnbaum did n't want to hear . He sat in the chair looking out onto the rain . Daniel , done with the lecture , moved away from the house  --  could he hear the shouting , too ?  --  and tossed the sodden dinosaur for Barney to chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the other side of the wall , no more words , just his son crying , then quiet moans , Birnbaum realized , of pleasure . Peter uttered a soft " Oh . " Birnbaum , trying not to hear , turned closer to the window , muttering words in his chair , a Hebrew prayer for safekeeping . <p> He had fallen asleep again , or it seemed so , because when he woke , things happened out of sequence , sound splayed off from sight . First the crunching of fast tires , a horn blast . A man gets slowly out of a pickup . Daniel is by the car they are working on , helping , smiling as Peter hands him a wrench . Screaming ; somebody is crying . Daniel hooks a toss of the dinosaur over the maple into the road . Peter and Daniel play in the yard , the father catching the boy , tossing him in the air . Gleefully , the boy chases the dog chasing the toy into the street . Daniel laughing . Someone shouts . Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A honk and a wild spray of gravel . They stand around two forms in the street , an unmoving dog and a toy dinosaur . The boy calls , " No , Barney ! " and his mother is holding him on her knees , the man from the truck is kneeling over the dog with Keith . Then the father walks to the son and takes him from Janine 's lap , to embrace him , it seems at first ; but he begins hitting him , hard , with an open hand , holding him out with one hand to get at him with the other , grunting . In Birnbaum 's dream Peter was a child again . He and Ruthie and Schteiner were at a school play , proudly watching the boy in a white shirt and black tights , Judah Maccabee wielding a wooden sword . Daniel 's head turns as each slap reaches face , neck , head . Birnbaum can make out " I. Told . You . Never , " and the boy at first is squirming , trying to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limp , hangs from his father 's grasp impassively absorbing the blows until Janine , then Keith , then Birnbaum running into the yard in his underwear , get Peter away from the child . <p> In the car , Birnbaum watched Peter and the road ahead . Keith and Janine had taken the dog , breathing in pants and with at least one shattered leg , to the hospital . Daniel and the baby were at a neighbor 's , where the still-tearful boy was promised he could eat cookies till his parents came home . Janine had said good-bye while Peter sat on the hood of the car , smoking . She was cold in a sweater and kept her arms around herself as Birnbaum embraced her . From crying , from exhaustion perhaps , her face was slack , sensual , and as he kissed her Birnbaum thought of Peter 's hands on her , his hands on the boy . <p> " I 'm sorry , " she told Birnbaum . <p> " I did n't want this , " he said . <p> " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder at the truck , where Keith waited and the dog lay on a blanket on the seat . " We 'll try again sometime , OK ? " She smiled and kissed him on the cheek , then moved around him to the truck . <p> Birnbaum looked at the rain while his son drove and smoked . Drops ticked lightly on the glass , and over the fields rain hung in far fringes , no difference between sky and earth , clouds in tiers , striating , some so low it seemed he could reach out a hand and touch them . He had never seen weather to look at before , not right there for you to see . <p> Peter kept the wipers off until the window was dotted with rain , lights looping in prismatic arches across the glass . Then , like a man brushing away a fly , he would flick his wrist and turn the wipers on for a single swipe . <p> Birnbaum tried not to think . He watched his son , this man , nearly forty now , deep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intruder , more , an upsetter of some balance he had no knowledge of . He knew , simply , he had to leave . Once Daniel was inside the house , Keith had given Peter a cigarette , and the man in the pickup , after apologizing again and shaking Peter 's hand , got in his truck and left . Birnbaum had walked up to Peter , smoke in his face , and said , " What is wrong with you ? How do you hit your boy like that ? " Peter appeared for a moment as if he might answer , then looked at Keith , back at Birnbaum , his face working . The laugh , when it came , shocked the old man , twisting out of his son 's mouth as the lips clamped down on the cigarette . It was a deep laugh , of pleasure , it seemed , and something almost like affection passed through Peter 's eyes before he raised a blackened hand to wipe them . Birnbaum had left him , gone indoors to wait . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face tight around its cigarette , the eyes glancing in the rearview mirror whitened , wide . The anger that had swarmed in his guts was gone , and if fear was there still it was overspread with weariness . He would have liked to say something to his son  --  he wanted nothing now ; he thought , this moment , little of the future or the past . He wanted to pass on something friendly , helpful , an older man to a younger . He , too , knew Peter 's sadness  --  age bringing little comfort , instead soiled prospects , dimming hope  --  and felt if anyone could offer a kind word , it was he . But he was tired . The airport was near ; he was going home , back to Schteiner and whatever waited there . He put a hand to his face and thought , with startled relief , Now we are strangers . He closed his eyes and said nothing . <p> At the airport , Peter talked with the skycap while Birnbaum gave the man behind the stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow in a white shirt and blue cap , hummed a tune Birnbaum thought he recognized but could not place . Throughout the transaction , pulling the ticket , checking the baggage , stamping the boarding pass , he did not cease his soft humming or look at Birnbaum once . When he was done , Birnbaum turned to Peter , who was handing the skycap some money . <p> " I 'll get that , " Birnbaum said . <p> " Already done , " Peter said , as the skycap moved away with the bags . <p> Birnbaum breathed . " Well , " he said , " Peter . " <p> Peter took a last drag on his cigarette and tossed it into a puddle by the curb . They watched the cigarette end turn in the water . " Have a safe trip , " Peter said . <p> " Peter , " he said again . Looking at his son , he became aware of his heart beating , and his breath rose in him , trembling , as if he had run here from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was hoping we would talk a little . " <p> " Yeah , " Peter said . " Well . " He looked at his father , then away , at the taxis and cars lined three deep in the street . " It 's like Janine said , just not the best time . Work stuff , you know ? " <p> " We should try , " Birnbaum said , the words riding on air that seemed forced from his lungs . " I have some things I 'd like to say to you . As a friend . " <p> " Sure , " Peter said , reaching already for the cigarettes in his pocket . " I 'll give you a call . " <p> They embraced , awkwardly , shoulders in the way . Birnbaum turned to the boy to kiss him and saw , with surprise , Peter 's eyes on him , reflecting back his own familiar look , the dark , glittering sorrow , abiding fear , an absolute certainty that the future , no matter how far it spanned before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he turned away from this sight . The two men lightly touched hands , and Birnbaum headed for the glass doors . When he looked back through the glass Peter was leaning over the steering wheel intently , jiggling something to get the car started . <p> Birnbaum sat by the window with his eyes shut as the rest of the passengers boarded , found their seats . He dozed through the familiar litany of safety procedures , opened his eyes once when he thought he heard Connie , otherwise kept them closed , hoping by his posture to entice sleep , but it would n't come . Outside they had not cleared the cloud cover , and rain pelted the small windows . <p> Next to him , as if by plan , sat another old woman , white hair in a stiff confederation of curls . She was reading the same Cosmopolitan he had looked at earlier , and Birnbaum thought of telling her about the article on the old movie star , but he hoped for sleep instead . Though he had barely spoken all day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time . By the woman 's feet was a round quilted purse the size of a footstool , and under the seat in front she had crammed a huge flowered shopping bag that occupied nearly all Birnbaum 's legroom . <p> He looked up the aisle , again noting the odd angles in the cabin . In here , they seemed to be level , and except for the noise of the engines and the slight strain in his back , Birnbaum could not tell they were flying . A stewardess maneuvered a cart built within half an inch of either side down the aisle . A droplet hit his lap , and looking up he noticed a small trail of water inching from the light strip to the window . <p> The cabin started to shake harder , first separating somehow from the background vibration of flight , then seeming to lurch to the left . The stewardess , in the same blue uniform Connie had worn , fell onto a man two rows up and apologized , chuckling , and wiped the shoulder of his jacket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with a ding , and the copilot came over the loudspeaker to explain , in tones almost laughably calm and offhand , that they were experiencing some turbulence from the electrical storms outside . " Gave us a little kick in the old keister there , folks . Nothin ' to worry about . " <p> In a few minutes the plane leveled off and the ride again became smooth . Birnbaum could see a long carpet of cloud in the moonlight and , on the horizon , strobing lights like conflagrations in distant cities . Far off , huge gray clouds loomed upward from the carpet . He sat back and concentrated on the drinks cart , which had stopped just a few rows in front . <p> Suddenly there was a change in the air  --  for a moment gravity vanished , and they floated , poised , above the clouds . Then they were in the clouds again , water against the windows , and the plane seemed to land on something hard  --  though it was , must have been , only air  --  with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . Ahead , a luggage rack burst open , toppling a red coat into the aisle , while behind it , a bottle of French mineral water sprang open , unhurriedly spilling its contents onto the floor . People were screaming . <p> The cabin seemed to torque on itself , diving , quivering in its fall . As in a dream , everything seemed to move faster and slower at once . A sound like escaping gas filled the cabin , and from a panel in the ceiling plastic tendrils with yellow oxygen masks attached dangled before the passengers . Birnbaum saw hands grab for the masks . A young woman across the aisle , against regulations , frantically worked a mask over her crying daughter , then reached for her own . Before Birnbaum and the lady beside him only one mask hung down . The woman , eyes wide with fear , snatched it and pulled the elastic quickly over her head . Something came over the intercom . Birnbaum could n't hear it . The woman breathed deeply with her eyes closed a moment , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue eyes , clouded with cataracts , and with each breath she closed , then opened , her eyes and watched Birnbaum . He looked back helplessly . He thought , With you ? <p> He fought to stand and check the ceiling panel for the other mask . There was none . He sat back down , breathing shallowly , touching his chest to measure its rise and fall . The woman held onto her chair with both hands . He wanted to say something to her once he got his breath . It seemed of vital importance that he say something to her . In his mind an image , suddenly , of Peter , on the other side of this storm , driving behind a lit cigarette in the rain . " My son , " he said to the woman . " He 'll get caught in the storm . " But she did n't hear . They looked at each other steadily , Birnbaum swallowing air , the woman breathing deep , and they waited to see what would happen next . He put a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stewardess , her blond hair uncapped , falling over one shoulder , face distorted behind her own oxygen mask , reached a mask to Birnbaum from a vacant seat in the row behind . When he could n't get it on , she helped him . She told him it would be all right . She told him to breathe calmly , and he tried , sucking thin air with difficulty into his aching lungs . He stared , as did everyone else , at the front of the cabin . <p> Then the plane , again , climbed steadily . The copilot 's voice , with a jocular tinge to it as if they had been through a fine time together , came back on . In the tones of a football coach explaining a busted play , he apologized for the jolt , said those electric storms were the dillies , but they 'd outfaced the sucker . He announced that as soon as the flight attendants made sure everyone was comfortable , there would be free drinks throughout the cabin , first round on him . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somewhere a baby cried , and the air filled with noises of relief , laughter , jokes , small victory cheers . The woman beside him took off her mask and looked again at Birnbaum . He tried to smile but could n't get the muscles to work . He was n't getting enough air . He sat behind the mask , feeling its pressure on his face , still trying , with deep swallows , to breathe . From both shoulders now , cold hands reaching into his empty chest . He had something he wanted to say . He kept his feet fiat on the floor and his hands on the armrests . He fixed his eyes on the woman , who watched him steadily from behind impermeable blue eyes . He breathed . With his feet on the floor and his hands on the armrests , he braced himself as hard as he could into the seatback , as if to delay , for even a moment , the plane 's inexorable course home . <p> <p> By EHUD HAVAZELET <p>       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
