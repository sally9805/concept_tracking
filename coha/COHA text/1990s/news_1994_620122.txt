<p> One minute , the Sausalito pre-kindergartners are smashing their rice and vegetables , Cat-in-the-Hat grins on their faces . The next , they are discussing AIDS over the sticky lunch table . They are 5 , and they are savvy . They have heard about AIDS . They know it is not good . <p> " Like when people have AIDS , I think they could die , " says Derell Lundy , as he spoons peas and carrots into his mouth . <p> The how-you-get-it part is trickier . These pupils at Bayside/Martin Luther King School know you can get AIDS " by germs . " For them , this means that maybe : <p> You can get it if someone licked a pack of gum , and you pick it up from the ground ? When you dig in the garbage , and you do n't wash your hands ? From cigarettes ? <p> Fourth-grader Laron Striplin knows where AIDS comes from . " Needles , " he says . " Drugs . Blood transfutation . " <p> If trends continue , in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexually transmitted diseases at the fastest rate  --  teenagers . <p> Fifteen- to 19-year-olds have the highest rate in the state of gonorrhea and chlamydia . And that , experts say , means the teenagers are also very much at risk for HIV and AIDS . <p> " It 's like looking at the night sky . What you see as a twinkling star may have already exploded , " said Tom Peters , director of the Marin County Department of Health and Human Services . <p> Those statistics raise thorny questions about what is being done to teach children about AIDS while there is still no cure in sight . Communities are wrangling over how to teach a subject far more sensitive than plain old sex education  --  trying to decide which children will learn how much of what , and when . <p> NOT EVERYONE IS HAPPY <p> Some parents , for religious , cultural or moral reasons , do not allow their children to attend AIDS education classes . Others say they support AIDS lessons but do not like how they have been taught . <p> Many teenagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that teachers do not tell them enough about sex . <p> " Our concern is that in 10 years , students will be dying because of their behavior now , " said Sherry Loofbourrow , president of the California School Boards Association , which represents more than 5,000 elected school board members in California . " People will be turning to us and saying , ' Why did n't you prevent this ? ' " <p> On the one hand , there is the tendency to say little , to preserve innocence . On the other hand , there is the cry of urgency to educate before it is too late . <p> It is not enough to teach children on only one morning to avoid playing blood-mixing games , educators say . Youngsters forget . AIDS education has to be an ongoing process , growing more sophisticated as the children move up in school . <p> But how do you tell kindergartners about HIV ? What do you say when a 10-year-old asks whether you have safe sex ? How do you answer the 13-year-old who asks when to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In California , AIDS education for elementary school children is voluntary . State law requires it only in junior and senior high school , as of 1992  --  and then , " at least once " in each . <p> Many schools are doing more , starting in kindergarten with lessons about germs and why people should wash their hands , and adding in later grades more complex ideas about HIV and how it is transmitted . <p> In San Francisco , AIDS education is mandatory in all 120 public schools . <p> " The earlier we can teach children to become comfortable with understanding the transmission of HIV  --  and teaching them to practice universal precautions such as washing their hands and not touching blood products  --  the better off we will be as a society , " said Gail Maurer , the state 's HIV- prevention education coordinator . <p> Statewide , 68 percent of elementary schools and nearly all junior and high schools provide HIV- prevention education , according to a survey to be released in December . <p> The study , by Duerr Evaluation Resources , polled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices of education , and 814 private schools . <p> Time spent learning about AIDS is still minuscule compared with that spent on math and science , and even on physical education . <p> The survey found that elementary school students learn about AIDS for four hours annually , on average . Middle school students get six hours . High school students get seven . <p> METHODS OF INSTRUCTION <p> In the Bay Area , teaching methods range from the funny to the serious  --  from science teachers , to actors in hospital-sponsored plays , to comedy acts with rubbery props , to rappers , to a giant blue bunny-man . <p> Ruby Petersen Unger of Mill Valley , a former Ms. Romper Room , uses rubber gloves , fish and food in her metaphor-juggling AIDS ed classes , but never , ever uses the words " sex " or " condom . " <p> " The minute I say the word ' latex , ' they know what I 'm talking about , " Unger said recently in a teachers ' lunchroom . <p> Unger 's nationally award-winning musical AIDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is the first of its kind for 3- to 8-year- olds , their teachers and their parents . <p> In an eighth-grade science class at Canyon Middle School in Castro Valley , the former stand-up comedian slaps a fake rubbery green fish on her arm . She smears Crisco on students ' hands . She teaches about the " warm , wet spots , " the title of her newest video . <p> The fish is like HIV  --  it dies outside your body , Unger tells the children . <p> Then comes the embarrassing stuff . <p> " There are parts of your body that are covered by your underwear , that cover openings into the body , " Unger says . There are giggles . <p> These are places where germs can grow , she says . More giggles . <p> Onto the palms of a boy and a girl she smears Crisco and spices . To show how the germs can spread between certain uncovered body parts , Unger smashes their hands together . The giggles escalate . <p> Then , with a square of latex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spice-germs do not mix . <p> Across the bay , inside Alamo Elementary School in San Francisco , the AIDS educators are a little more explicit . <p> They are two rappers , and Jason , 32 , who is HIV-positive . They are all from the New Conservatory Theatre . <p> The rappers rap : <p> " AIDS is a germ/You ca n't see it with your eye/But it can wear you down/And make you die ! . . . If someone wants to be a blood brother/Do n't stick your hand with a pin/Just hold out your hand/And give your buddy some skin ! " <p> FRANK DISCUSSIONS <p> Then it 's Jason 's turn . <p> The wide-eyed third-graders sitting at tiny tables grow very still . <p> " Does it hurt when you have AIDS ? . . . How long do you get to live ? . . . When you die , does the virus die , too ? . . . Did your mother and father get mad when they found out ? " <p> " It can be very scary , " Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't feel any different . But sometimes I am reminded when the pain starts . " <p> Jason tells children who ask about sex  --  the questioners have been as young as 7  --  that , yes , you can get the virus through unprotected sex . <p> " I said that it 's in semen and women 's fluids , and it can be passed like that , " Jason said . " I 'm not scared to answer , but the teachers kind of freak out . I think the teachers are scared of the parents . " <p> There are parents who say their children have been scarred by learning too much , too fast . <p> Bruce Budnick of San Francisco will never forget what his daughter said she learned in her sixth-grade class one day . Two years later , it still makes him angry . <p> Two gay speakers , a man and a woman , spoke " pornographically " to the children , Budnick said , and told how they used dildos and performed oral and anal sex . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Against Violence , which often sends speakers to junior high and high schools to " demystify homosexuality " before AIDS lessons begin . <p> " If this had happened outside of the school , they would have been arrested for lewd and lascivious behavior , " Budnick said . <p> Terry Person , program director of Community United Against Violence , said Budnick has blown everything out of proportion . <p> " I understand there was one isolated incident . . . an answer to a student who asked a very explicit question about dildos . It 's been dogging us for years , " she said . <p> Such questions would be answered in general terms , she said . On dildos : " That some people of either persuasion utilize sex toys . Period . " <p> Others oppose AIDS programs because they fail to advocate straight , married monogamy . <p> In California 's Del Norte County , a conservative group tried unsuccessfully to stop AIDS education in sixth , eighth and tenth grades , saying the message failed to stress the virtues of matrimony . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of a Kaiser Permanente Hospital-sponsored AIDS play for junior high and high school students . They said the play , called " Secrets , " taught too much about sex and drugs . <p> It was " absolute censorship , " argued " Secrets " director Scott Kessler . <p> Sex is a reality for teenagers , Kessler said at a school meeting . " We have a truly terrible crisis on our hands , and we are trying to save lives , " he said . <p> The play has been approved for high schools in Fremont . <p> NO MONEY AVAILABLE The sex debate is not the only kind of challenge facing AIDS educators <p> Money is a big one . Schools are so swamped with growing numbers of AIDS lessons  --  plus shrinking budgets and staff cutbacks  --  that educators often do not know who is doing what . <p> The Santa Clara County Office of Education , like many offices across the state , does not know which AIDS programs are where in its 33 districts . To find out , you have to call all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack , " said Linda Bonin , health prevention education coordinator . " There 's not enough money . . . . It 's like trying to stand up in a boat , and everybody 's rocking it , " <p> At the Healthy Kids Resource Center in Hayward , there are more than 150 AIDS videos , laserdiscs , curriculum guides and reference books for classrooms , teachers and even food-service workers . <p> The state and federally funded center has a comprehensive health education lending library for schools . <p> Some programs aim at black girls and Latino youth at risk . Others emphasize the safer use of intravenous drugs . Others talk about safer sex practices . <p> Peters , Marin County 's health director , said , " None of us adults has a uniformly appropriate message , from those who totally support abstinence to those who want a condom placed like a fresh mint on a school desk every morning . <p> " We need a whole menu to choose from , " said Peters , who in the spring convened a 50-person roundtable for opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How do young people make the Grand Canyon leap from knowledge to behavior ? It 's not so much what you can recite at 10 a.m . Wednesday morning as what goes on at 11:15 on Friday night . " <p> While adults struggle with what to leave in and what to leave out , children are often more comfortable with discussions of bodily functions . <p> Abigail Lawton is comfortable , shockingly so . <p> She is 7 . She sits cross-legged in purple leggings on the Alamo Elementary School playground in San Francisco , looking like she knows nothing of kissing , much less birth control . But she does . <p> " A condom is like a tiny bag that you put on your vagina or penis , " Abigail said . Her friends stop eating their cookies . <p> " You can get AIDS if a doctor or nurse makes a test with a needle and puts it in somebody else . Also by mixing blood , " she said . <p> Her friend Elaine Yip , 8 , whispered in her ear , " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Abigail said . " It 's by sex . If you 're having sex with somebody who has AIDS , and you 're not using condoms . " <p> " Like a condominium ? " a little girl asked . <p> Elaine knows what sex is . " It 's gross ! " she said . " You have to take off your clothes ! " <p> NAMING NAMES <p> With AIDS and sex ed now inextricably linked , the old Kotex movies just will not do anymore . <p> " I used to start out showing films of frogs , fish and puppies , " said Jan Gelatti , a Larkspur school nurse who has been teaching family life to fourth- through eighth- graders for 22 years . <p> " Now , kids are going to movies like ' Parenthood ' and coming up with questions like , ' What 's a diaphragm ? What 's a dildo ? ' I ca n't get away with a film strip on frogs . " <p> For many older students , the adult angst over anatomical phraseology is pointless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condom  --  is " a symbol of sexual repression , " said student Aaron Greenwald of Sir Francis Drake High School in San Anselmo . <p> " You need to say ' penis ' and you need to say ' ejaculation , ' so kids are comfortable with it by the time they get to high school , " Greenwald said . <p> " The kids know a lot of things , but it 's the wrong stuff , " said Laetitia Poisson de Souzy , a Tamalpais High School student . " We are asking to be educated . . . . Until you feel comfortable saying the words , you 're not going to feel comfortable saying no. "
