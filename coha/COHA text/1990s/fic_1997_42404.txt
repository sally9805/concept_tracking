ABSOLUTELY NOT . Crazy . Ridiculous . " Eskanazzi 's brain is fast and he always speaks fast . <p> " Listen , " she says . " Please . Please . " Looking at the table . <p> " For this , " he says , " this is the reason ? Y'know what time it was in Jerusalem ? I thought you were dying or something . " <p> " It was a terrible thing to do , " she says , " but listen . Have . Please . " She turns her head away so he ca n't see her face . Gathers the blonde hair at the back of her neck in a tight , vague grip . They are alone on the back terrace of a country club on a spring morning , ten o'clock , 1978 . The sun bright and shadows sharp and the flag straining and snapping in the breeze . <p> " I 'm sorry , " he says . " I 'm sorry . But there is nothing , zero , nothing , I can do about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way but honestly , this girl , she wants to marry a sheigetz , fine , let her do it , gezunterheyt , because honestly , this girl " - and he stops short . He scowls at the table . And looks up again : " This girl is a slut . And this should be her worst problem , marrying Horst Wessel or whoever the hell he is , this gem of an individual . " And turns sharply away , looking in anger at the perfect green slope of the golf course in the distance . <p> When she collects herself and looks at him again , her blue eyes are bright with desperation and her lips are pressed hard against her fist ; you see her face only from the nose up . <p> " I 'm sorry , " he says . " But it changes nothing ; what can I do ? Nothing . Forget it . " <p> For a Jewish girl to marry a non-Jew was an everyday event in 1978 , but you could still find people who were frantic to stop it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern Jewish community from scattering elegantly on the breeze . Rabbi Steven Eskanazzi was twenty-seven at this point : slight , with a white shirt and knitted black yarmulke and wavy black hair , offhand manner , cold voice , hot eyes . Many of the smartest young Orthodox men were ordained as rabbis , meaning that they knew Talmud and halakhah and the fine points of Jewish life . Only a few became pulpit rabbis . Eskanazzi never dreamed of it . Mostly they went into medicine or law , business or teaching , academia or accounting or science . They went everywhere and did everything-jumped in but stood apart . And they smiled in a certain way , like the man who knows a secret and is content to keep it . Who knows more about you than you do about him . <p> In 1978 you could see these modern-style Orthodox Jews all over New York , and they looked like everyone else , except for the men wearing yarmulkes . Not all the men-but the younger they were , the more secure in this idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their yarmulkes full-time . The smile did n't matter to Gentiles but drove other Jews crazy or , now and then , brought one to a dead halt and left him puzzled and uneasy , as if he had seen his Doppelganger in a dream . <p> LISTEN . " SHE looks at the table . ( The wind playing delicately with the points of her collar . Her neck and the triangle of skin inside the collar 's V and her strand of tiny carnelian beads in shadow . ) " He 's not just a German . He looks like a German . He 's got this smug " - words on tiptoe to keep from crying . She stops . The flag strains tight and beats . " If it were just any girl . But Jackie . .... " <p> " But jackie-you 're too much of a mensch to be her friend . I know you were big pals a long time ago , so what ? She 's your cousin-big deal , g'bye , forget about it . Y'know what ? " He stops as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grapefruit in front of her . The food is supposedly kosher , but he does n't believe it is seriously kosher and wo n't eat it . In 1978 the Orthodox community is holding together and the rest is dandelion seed giving way before the breeze . A certain kind of person saw it all in agonizing slow motion as it happened . <p> " Coffee and grapefruit ? " he says . " Yeccccch . Is n't that like-acid and acid ? " Screws up his face . She finds his vivid repugnance-face so little-boyish she has to smile . The smile is gone instantaneously . He looks ( playful and suspicious ) at her grapefruit . His moods are intense , but they come and go abruptly . <p> " Listen , " he says . ( The waiter has taken his ostentatious indifference back inside . ) " I 'm really sorry , okay ? It should n't happen to anyone . If I could do something I would . But I ca n't . So listen . You look great , how 're you doing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been in Jerusalem working on his Ph.D . dissertation , living in a yeshiva . She phoned and he came-back to Great Neck , Long Island , where they had grown up on the same block . <p> " He 's okay . " <p> " When 's the wedding ? " Teasing . <p> " No wedding , " she says ; with her eyes unfocused she spoons a wedge of grapefruit . They have known each other since he was ten , she was eight ; she has never won an argument with him . Not in seventeen years . She never expects to . And yet he would do anything for his friends . That is the only issue . His kindness . She is not Orthodox but cares about Jewishness and teaches at a liberal Jewish day school . They have known each other for a long time . The flag beats and snaps . Her hair ( pinned up with a barrette on one side ) stirs in the breeze . He steadies his yarmulke with one hand ; with the other he squeezes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything for his friends . " You would do anything , " she says , looking at her grapefruit , " for your friends . " <p> " Anything ? Yeah ? " The boyish smile . " I would n't say that . " <p> " You dropped everything and flew halfway around the world to come and see me . " <p> " Sure , I thought you were dying-I mean not literally , God forbid-I thought you were in big , big , big trouble . " " I am . " <p> He sighs- " Please . All right , you are . Fine . You are . But there 's nothing I can do about it and there 's nothing you can do about it , so honestlydrop it . You did a mitzvah , you tried , you failed , fine , forget it ; eat your grapefruit . " <p> " But there is something you can do about it . There is . " <p> Shakes his head stiffly in repugnance . " What d' you want ? - maybe I should call her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethics ? I 'm sure that 'll make a big impression . That 'll go over big . Her entire life is a negation of Jewish ethics . Honestly . Please . " <p> " There is something you can do . " Conspiratorial and stubborn . " There is . It 's this : take her out . That 's the only thing . If you did , she would listen to you . " <p> " Take her out ? " When he delivers a sentence slowly the effect is withering . " Like on a date ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> He shakes his head so briskly it is more like a shudder . " Please . Please . This is loony-bin stuff . " <p> " She admires you very much . She looks up to you very much . At one point she was in love with you . I think she still is . " <p> He squints at her . The flag straining and beating ; the air breathlessly bright . " You could seduce her , " she says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " after a moment , " I love you but you 've cracked . " <p> " Just once ? Take her out just once ? " <p> " You 've cracked . " <p> " Just once ? " <p> " Not only would I make a fool of myself by asking her , but the whole thing-honestly-I ca n't believe we 're even discussing this . " He only dates Orthodox women because he ca n't picture marrying any other sort . <p> " I 'll set it up ? Just once . Just once ? <p> " Jackie was in love with you , " she continues after his silence . His brown eyes have lost their glitter and gone deeply translucent . Root-beer brown : she remembers thinking of them in those terms years ago . Soda in clear glass in sunlight , the bubbles streaming . " She mentioned you very recently , out of the blue . Even I was surprised . " <p> " In love . Please . Years and years ago , " his repugnance-voice and repugnance-face returning-he takes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she claimed to have a thing for me which lasted , what , know , ten minutes , and the reason she had it is because I was the one boy in the neighborhood who would n't roll over and play dead for her , as you know perfectly well , the one boy inside a 100-mile radius centered on her bedroom-except for the other Orthodox people in the neighborhood-who had no interest in her whatsoever . In love . Please . " <p> " I 'll set it up . Just once ? " <p> The breeze quiets for a moment and they hear a car grinding the dry pebbles in the parking lot . A distant lawnmower . <p> She does n't know what passed between her cousin and Steven Eskanazzi ten years ago , but Jackie has tormented her on the subject ever since . " Would n't you love to know what happened between Stevie and me ? " With her big bright gorgeous , teasing , needling smile . Her inability to sit still , and her grace that made you catch your breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prettier than Jackie , but then again Jackie warped the entire sexual field of the earth from Great Neck to the South Pole merely by existing . Six years ago they were home from college on winter break , alone in the late afternoon in Jackie 's parents ' living room , Libbie barefoot in faded jeans on the floor , dangling her long undergraduate hair like drapery so it just grazed the thick carpet , aware of her reflection in the bare black of the picture window , and Jackie putting a tray with Japanese tea on a piano bench and needling her ( " Would n't you love to know what happened between Stevie and me ? " ) , then grabbing a shiny red throw pillow and pummeling her playfully over the head-as smiling Libbie , long-haired and lonely , shielded her head with folded arms-and Jackie dropped into a fencer 's crouch , menaced her with an imaginary foil for three seconds and then dissolved into musical giggling and served tea . <p> THAT was ' 72 and now it was ' 78 . Nineteen seventy-eight was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in a fog . Yet it still had the impression that its sickness was temporary . Would vanish if it could only get away and lie down . Inflation and the oil cartel and the rising price of gold and President Jimmy Carter 's face made people nervous ; his humorless smile made people cringe . Yet the nation was rich and still getting used to its wealth-to the after-effects of the huge , unprecedented boom that had only recently tapered off . Near the country club with the patio and the flag and the almost-kosher food , an A &S; department store was set like a sprawling military complex in a vast parking lot in a private dell . Cars arrived and departed all day and into the evening . Women got out of their spanking-new Toyota Celicas and Honda Accords and Saab 900 's and diesel Benzes ( Detroit was flat on its back ) , slammed the doors smartly , strode into the building and returned with big shopping bags . A tony and expensive store that was always mobbed . <p> " You do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk from the patio toward the parking lot , " and you do n't know anything about yourself . " With a nervous sidelong smile . He has agreed to go out with Jackie exactly once , if Libbie can set it up . Libbie has plotted to tell him this for years , in precisely these words . The call to Israel and the proposition this morning are two death leaps she attempted only because she had somehow got herself , twice , onto the high diving board with no other way down . Two leaps with eyes shut and brain disengaged . And they have both come off , which makes her feel strange . She might have been sixteen when these words first occurred to her : You do n't know anything about women , and you do n't know anything about yourself . <p> He shrugs . " Maybe not . " A moment later : " Y'know , I drove a Fiat in Israel , too . I mean , the times I had a car . Not all that often . " Jingling his keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green Fiat 850 , a two-seat convertible with its top down-cheap , pretty , and unreliable . He opens her door . She eases herself ( smoothing her pleated skirt underneath ) into the low seat . She buckles the seat belt , slips off her flats , draws her crossed ankles tight beneath her seat and against the right door . She 's tall and the car is small . He has shut her door , walked around and opened his own ; he slides in beside her . " Who owns this place ? " he asks . Starting the engine . " Does it have something to do with your family , did someone tell me once ? " <p> " Not that I know of I think some sort of board owns it . I do n't know . " A painful blaze of sunlight off the chrome rear-view mirror as she turns her head . <p> He shifts into reverse and winds backward in a tight arc as the gears sing ; shifts to first and crunches over the pebbles to the long asphalt driveway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to make conversation impossible for the rush of wind . He drives her home . She watches him shift gears . She loves watching him shift gears : his offhand precision as he thinks frowningly about something else . <p> THAT AFTERNOON he parks a few blocks from the eastern outpost of the New York City subway at 188th Street in Queens . Carefully he hooks one end of the steel crook-lock around the steering wheel , the other end around the clutch . He closes the top , locks the door , and sets out for the station down residential blocks of immaculate small houses on tiny lots-past mirrored spheres and fiberglass fawns and a concrete Virgin in a blue-and-white tiled grotto . The station underground is brown and cool , with a row of identical posters advertising John Travolta in a white suit , arms flung wide . The platform is nearly empty , hollow silence echoing to infinity down the dark tunnel as he waits . <p> He rides the F , D , and 1 trains 45 minutes into the city , with a melody in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of it ; emerges at Broadway and 72nd and starts for the small yeshiva where several of his best friends teach . He has taught there too . It 's an oddball institution : certain highschool students are there part-time , certain college graduates full-time . The streets are wan and tired . A cab rattling by at top speed leaves paper trash aswirl in the gutter . He has n't been at the yeshiva in five months . He walks faster as he gets near . <p> The medium-large room on the third floor is full of voices . Five long tables-caterer 's equipment with Formica tops , a makeshift set-up . They are all covered with big open books and students cluster around them , listening to a teacher in small groups or studying head-to-head in pairs . Most are in open shirts ; their knitted yarmulkes bob in a dozen colors . Three walls are covered floor to ceiling with the black , brown , and burgundy of Hebrew books packed and piled onto shelves , bare of dust jackets , the titles picked out in gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times scattered about ; the windows on the fourth wall give out onto 73rd-they face north and admit no sun , a row of pale bright rectangles that leave the inside feeling sheltered and dark . <p> The warm prickly voices tangling in argument and untangling and the enveloping books he loves the sight , smell , heft , and feel of and the intellectual tautness and the haphazard dusty holiness of the air make this room , for Steven Eskanazzi , the best place in the world . Rafi coming toward him . They hug each other . Rafi with his woolen hair and big , permanent smile and suntanned look . A half-dozen other young men surround them . The students watch from their seats ; even those who have never studied with Steven Eskanazzi know about him . He is famous in these parts as a Talmud scholar , but prefers to work on the Bible . His dissertation is on Psalms . <p> He joins Rafi at a long table . Others pull up chairs and they talk : Israel , his work , their work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rav Soloveitchik ( a four-times longer topic than any other ) , the Lincoln Square Synagogue , the Carlebach shul , Meryl Streep ( I'havdil ) , Saturday Night Live , Woody Allen , the wedding of Daniel Fein , the wedding of Ernie Lasker . Then Steven says abstractly , " I have this tune in mind . I ca n't get it out of my head . It keeps repeating . I heard it on a record a long time ago , scratchy old record-a hazzan who wrote his own music singing in a haunting , moving kind of way , kol yisroel yesh lohem helek l'olom ha'bo . " <p> They all know the words , the start of Pirkei Avos , the collected moral precepts of the Mishnah : all Jews have a place in the world to come . <p> " Anyone ever heard this record ? Know the name of the hazzan ? The sleeve had a small gold label , in Yiddish I think , I can picture it . The saddest music I ever heard . " <p> No one recognizes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tips the chair back on its hind legs and stares at the ceiling . At other tables the voices go on around him but they all , somehow , take account of his presence . <p> A moment later Rafi asks him something about a passage in the large open volume of Talmud before him . He brings his chair back to earth and answers . Rafi asks something else . Steven quotes a passage from a commentary . Rafi asks something else . " Where 's the Ran ? " Steven asks . He stands impatiently and scans the bookshelves , jingling coins in his pocket . He locates the large , slim volume of Rabbenu Nissim 's 14th-century glosses on the laws of betrothal , pulls it down and returns to the table . Flips it open . Finds the page . <p> THE MOMENT after he points to the right passage , he is looking out the window ( the pale bright rectangle of street light ) and hearing nothing . He and Jackie as teenagers sitting on the edge of her bed as he scowls at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His astonishment at the bedroom , like a parody of a girl 's bedroom , his suspicion that she has set it up this way to make fun of him-he would n't put it past her , yet it seems a touch too bizarre . The stockings droop gracefully from the bureau drawer , the pile of neatly-folded laundry with a bra on top . Otherwise it is what you expect , the portable phonograph with the lid up , a falling-over pile of 45 's beside it and albums stacked face-forward against the wall . The garish psychedelic posters-a worm in hot yellow-green crawling on a black field , the flower explosion in orange , yellow , and fluorescent-pink , the " War is Unhealthy for Children and other Living Things " in black lettering on white , the stuffed animals tumbled on the bed . She is amused , more than amused , by the way he feels obliged to stand aloof from the sex culture of 1968 . Sitting next to him with her legs crossed in her skirt that is short even when she stands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , settles back on her haunches pulling the skirt tight around her thighs , moving her head back and forth to a snatch of a Beatles song under her breath ( " and dance to a song/that was a hit before/your mother was born " ) ; she is always singing ; then up on her knees and yanks the pillow off the bed , and settles back again hugging it to her chest with both arms ; her sleeveless blouse ; lays her head sideways along the pillow 's top edge : his mind losing traction . Who 's kidding whom ? - you do n't wind up in a girl 's bedroom by accident . Not by accident . Her needling impossible smile . Someone is talking to him , proffering a large object of white cloth . <p> " Minhah ? " The head of the yeshiva , smiling . Steven smiles back , gets to his feet and takes the tallis , walks to the front of the room and stands facing the small , upright wooden box with the red velvet curtain . It serves as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chairs , and then 24 men and boys assemble in a loose standing group behind him . A whole chaotic establishment rising to pray-the most remarkable fact about any yeshiva . He drapes the tallis over his head , says the blessing , and places it stolewise over his shoulders , hitching up each side so it wo n't touch the floor . <p> He is supposed to start the afternoon prayers but does n't . He touches the fingers of his left hand to his forehead and stands silently . Swaying slightly forward and back . They look at his shoulders or out the window ; they wait . Through open windows they hear the panting rumble of a truck drawn up at the curb . He stands silent . It seems like a long time . At length he opens the book in his right hand , presses it to his chest , and with his eyes closed starts the Ashrei , and 24 voices join in behind him . Libbie in her tiny office is on the phone to her cousin . <p> Author Affiliation   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
