<p> It 's high noon at Skywalker Ranch in Marin , and the 250 people who preside over George Lucas ' film empire are in a quandary : which of the company 's four cafeterias should they visit for lunch ? <p> Should they grab a grilled chicken breast sandwich near the fitness center pool , where Robert Redford hangs out when he 's in town ? <p> Or should they go to the sky-lit technical building for rotini Florentine with chicken , herbed roasted tomatoes , garlic bread and passion fruit mousse ? <p> If they 're pressed for time , they might grab a box lunch at the Solarium . <p> But if they have a visitor , they might opt for the Victorian dining room , where waiters trained at the California Culinary Academy serve chocolate chip pound cake with berry compote , whipped up by the staff pastry chef . <p> " The most remarkable thing about this restaurant is that the staff learns about the personalities of the people eating here , " said Tom Christopher , special editor for the Star Wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look out for me . " <p> Welcome to the brave new world of company cafeterias or  --  as they 're now called  --  corporate restaurants . <p> In an effort to attract and retain employees , bring them together during the noon hour and keep them on campus  --  where they wo n't be waylaid by booze or traffic jams  --  big Bay Area employers are creating lavish lunchrooms that rival the region 's finest restaurants . <p> Lucasfilm Ltd.  --  with its own organic garden  --  is at the forefront of the trend . But it has plenty of company . <p> " Northern California offers without a doubt the finest food service in corporate dining , " said Mitchell Schechter , who follows the $ 20 billion-a-year cafeteria industry for Food Management magazine . <p> Schechter traced the evolution of the company cafeteria from the chuck wagons that fed railroad gangs , to the slop kitchens that served the steel workers of the Industrial Revolution , to the mess halls that GIs groused about during World War II . <p> He said California firms were forced to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were founded on human capital rather than coal or steel . <p> " The knowledge contained in their employees ' heads is literally the company 's asset base , " Schechter said . " They are the people the company has to make happy . " <p> In the 1970s , less than half of workers nationwide ate at company cafeterias . Today , as many as 75 percent of Bay Area workers regularly dine at the best Bay Area corporate restaurants , Schechter said . <p> Oracle Corp . is a prime example of how far companies have gone to cater to the food fancies of knowledge workers . <p> Patrick Garnier manages five corporate restaurants serving Oracle 's 5,900 employees . Each restaurant has a different theme , so workers can dine on sushi one day and steak the next , without ever repeating a meal . <p> The crown jewel in this culinary compound is Cafe 300 . Its stone tables and tiled floors create the feel of an Italian market . Homemade Italian ice cream and fresh pastries round out the luncheon fare . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can even e-mail an order for dinner to go , " Garnier said . " We 'll cook the meal for you , or just season it and provide instructions for the oven or microwave . " <p> As if fine food was n't enough , most companies subsidize their cafeterias by picking up the tab for kitchen equipment , dining room fixtures and utilities . That lets the contractors , who prepare and serve the food , charge about 20 percent less than restaurants . <p> Some companies provide a further subsidy that makes the meals even cheaper . " An item that sells for $ 2 costs ( the company ) about $ 3 , " said Cameron Erridge , the senior vice president who oversees Visa 's cafeteria in Foster City . <p> Those subsidies let Visa employees enjoy daily specials like sausage and porcini mushroom lasagne with red pepper sauce and a Caesar salad for $ 3.60 , or sea bass with tomato fennel sauce for $ 4.85 . <p> What bang does Visa get for its buck ? " It 's a way for people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restaurant and not meeting anyone , " Erridge said . <p> When Sun Microsystems built a new corporate campus in Menlo Park , it hired the San Francisco architectural firm Backen , Arrigoni &; Ross to design a $ 500,000 kitchen and 700-seat dining area with nooks and crannies to encourage face-to-face meetings . <p> " We wanted an environment that fostered interaction between individuals , " said Michael Lambert , the Sun executive who managed the construction . <p> At some cafeterias , the chow is so good even the top brass eat there . Lew Platt of Hewlett-Packard and Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems are two CEOs who often break bread with the rank and file . <p> Other employers take a more direct approach to keeping workers on the company grounds . <p> New United Motors Manufacturing plant in Fremont gives its 4,600 automobile workers 45 minutes pay , or about $ 12 , if they stay on the premises during lunch . <p> Nummi spokesman Michael Damer said the incentive helps keep workers from taking long lunches or getting tipsy over beers  --  either of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nummi , a joint venture of General Motors and Toyota , pays workers the bonus whether they bring their own lunch or eat in the company 's cafeteria , which is named " Kaizen , " teamwork in Japanese . Another reflection of the company 's bicultural ownership : Daily specials  --  like chicken fried steak and patty melts  --  are displayed under plastic domes , as they are in a Japanese noodle house . <p> Most cafeterias have some trait that identifies the company or its culture . <p> Safeway 's cafeteria in Pleasanton sells the company 's house brand Select sodas . <p> Charles Schwab &; Co. calls its take-out service the " Chuck Wagon Express , " a tip of the hat to the company 's founder . <p> At Silicon Graphics Inc. in Mountain View , every table , chair and wall in Cafe Iris is done in the same purple hue as the metal shells of the company 's high-speed computers . <p> Idiosyncrasies aside , the menus in most corporate dining rooms are remarkably similar . <p> That 's because four big food- service firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A handful of Bay Area companies hire their own chefs instead . Lucasfilm even named its staff chef , Sherri A. Nichelman , employee of the year . Autodesk , the San Rafael software firm , hired Rick Gernetti away from nearby Lucasfilm to run its cafeteria . <p> Williams-Sonoma Inc. , the San Francisco food and housewares retailer , felt it had to hire an in- house chef to run its cafeteria , which overlooks Fisherman 's Wharf . <p> " We 're a food-based company , " said Patrick Connolly , executive vice president . " It would be embarrassing if the cafeteria food was n't good . " <p> But the story of the Howard Lester tuna sandwich is a parable of the perils of trying to please a workforce of gourmets . <p> It seems company Chairman Howard Lester once offered a recipe for tuna salad that was too heavy on the mayo for the health- conscious staff . But when chef Lisa Lesowitz toned down the fat , Lester asked that his name be taken off the " Howard 's Tuna " sandwich . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Some companies use their cafeterias to impress not only employees , but also clients and other guests . <p> Ted Gagliano , an executive vice president of post production with 20th Century Fox in Los Angeles , said he enjoys eating at Skywalker Ranch . " I 'm supposed to come up here for work . But I really come here to eat and be in this setting , which is a lot better than the 20th Century commissary in L.A. " <p> Other companies prefer to keep their cafeterias under wraps . Gap Inc. would n't let a Chronicle reporter into its lunchroom in San Francisco because , a spokeswoman said , if Gap shareholders read about it they might think the company is doing too much for employees . <p> Cafeterias evolve as companies grow . <p> Three-year-old Netscape Communications , already worth $ 4 billion on Wall Street , apologized before showing a reporter through its dark , modest dining hall . <p> " We 're building a new , 28,000- square-foot cafeteria that should be open in October , " said Forrest Caro , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service firm . <p> Workers at Wired magazine in San Francisco used to whip up tofu dishes in a dingy pantry until chef Philip Ferrato was brought in to offer dishes such as gazpacho with organic heirloom tomatoes . <p> If all this pampering is really a corporate plot to keep workers nearby and steal seconds from the lunch hour , a lot of employees consider themselves lucky victims . <p> " A lot of us get something to go and eat at our desks , because we know the phone wo n't ring and we can actually get some work done , " said Phil VanTassell , a manager with Chevron 's human services department and frequent diner at its cafe in San Ramon . <p> " But at least that way , we can get everything finished by the end of the day and go home on time . " <p> While cheap gourmet meals may be the norm at large , rich corporations , most American workers still get , well , less . <p> The San Francisco Department of Human Services cafeteria looks like something that slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs and a picture window that overlooks a fire escape , the cafeteria serves microwaved items like toast and two slices of bacon for breakfast and hot links for lunch . <p> Cafeteria manager James Griffin would like to offer hot meals , but the ventilation system in the building is so bad , he ca n't use the kitchen equipment . <p> " If it were n't for the fan , I 'd be burning up in here , " Griffin said . <p> WE WANT YOUR FEEDBACK <p> How do these company restaurants compare to the one at your workplace ?
