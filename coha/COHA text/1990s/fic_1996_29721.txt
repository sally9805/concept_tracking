I do n't mean to bitch , but in the future I intend to hesitate before I do a favor for the friend of a friend . Never have I taken on such a load of grief . At the outset , it all seemed so innocent . I swear there 's no way I could have guessed what was coming down . I came this close to death and , perhaps worse ( for my fellow dental phobics ) , Within a hairbreadth of having my two front teeth knocked out . Currently I 'm sporting a knot on my head that 's the size of my fist . And all this for a job for which I did n't even get paid ! The matter came to my attention through my landlord , Henry Pitts , whom everybody knows I 've been half in love with for years . The fact that he 's eighty-five ( a mere fifty years my senior ) has never seemed to alter the basic impact of his appeal . He 's a sweetheart and he seldom asks me for anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request seemed so harmless on the face of it , without the faintest suggestion of the troubles to come . It was Thursday , November twenty-first , the week before Thanksgiving , and wedding festivities were just getting under way . Henry 's older brother William was to marry my friend Rosie , who runs the tacky little tavern in my neighborhood . Rosie 's restaurant was traditionally closed on Thanksgiving Day , and she was feeling smug that she and William could get hitched without her losing any business . With the ceremony and reception being held at the restaurant , she 'd managed to eliminate the necessity for a church . She 'd lined up a judge to perform the nuptials , and she apparently considered that his services were free . Henry had encouraged her to offer thejudge a modest honorarium , but she 'd given him a blank look , pretending she did n't speak English that well . She 's Hungarian by birth and has momentary lapses when it suits her purposes . She and William had been engaged for the better part of a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big event . I 've never been certain of Rosie 's actual age , but she has to be close to seventy . With William pushing eighty-eight , the phrase " until death do us part " was statistically more significant for them than for most . Before I delineate the nature of the business I took on , I suppose I should fill in a few quick personal facts . My name is Kinsey Millhone . I 'm a licensed investigator , female , twice divorced , without children or any other pesky dependents . For six years I 'd had an informal arrangement with California Fidelity Insurance , doing arson and wrongful death claims in exchange for office space . For almost a year now , since the termination of that agreement , I 'd been leasing an office from Kingman and Ives , a firm of attorneys here in Santa Teresa . Because of the wedding I was taking a week off , looking forward to rest and recreation when I was n't helping Henry with wedding preparations . Henry , long retired from his work as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also he catering the reception . There were eight of us in the wedding party . Rosie 's sister , Klotilde , who was wheelchair bound , would he serving as the maid of honor . Henry was to he the best man , with his older brothers , Lewis and Charlie , serving as the ushers . The four of them - Henry , William , Lewis , and Charlie ( also known collectively as " the boys " or " the kids " ) ranged in age from Henry 's eighty-five to Charlie 's ninety-three . Their only sister , Nell , still vigorous at ninety-five , was one of two bridesmaids , the other being me . For the ceremony Rosie had elected to wear an off-white organza muumuu with a crown of baby 's breath encircling her strangely dyed red hair . She 'd found a bolt of lavish floral polished cotton on sale . . . pink and mauve cabbage roses on a background of bright green . The fabric had been shipped off to Flint , Michigan , where Nell had " run up matching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't wait to try mine on . I was certain that , once assembled , the three of us would resemble nothing so much as a set of ambulatory bedroom drapes . At thirty-five , I 'd actually hoped to serve as the oldest living flower girl on record , but Rosie had decided to dispense with the role . This was going to he the wedding of the decade , one I would n't miss for all the money in the world . Which brings us hack to the " precipitating events " , as we refer to them in the crime trade . I ran into Henry at nine that Thursday morning as I was leaving my apartment I live in a converted single-car garage that 's attached to Henry 's house by means of an enclosed breezeway . I was heading to the supermarket , where I intended to stock up on junk food for the days ahead . When I opened my door , Henry was standing on my front step with a piece of scratch paper and a tape dispenser . Instead of his usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long pants and a blue dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up . I said , ' ' Well , do n't you look terrific . ' ' his hair is stark white and he wears it brushed softly to one side . Today it was slicked down with water , and I could still smell the warm citrus of his aftershave . His blue eyes seem ablaze in his lean , tanned face . He 's tall and slender , good-natured , smart , his manner a perfect blend of courtliness and nonchalance . If he was n't old enough to be my grand-daddy , I 'd snap him up in a trice . Henry smiled when he saw me . " There you are . Perfect . I was just leaving you a note . I did n't think you were home or I 'd have knocked on the door instead . I 'm on my way to the airport to pick up Nell and the boys , but I have a favor to ask . Do you have a minute ? " " Of course . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait " , I said . " What 's up ? " " Do you remember old Mr. Lee ? They called him Johnny here in the neighborhood . He 's the gentleman who used to live around the corner on Bay . Little white stucco house with the overgrown yard . To be accurate , Johnny lived in the garage apartment . His grandson , Bucky , and his wife have been living in the house . " The bungalow in question , which I passed in the course of my daily jog , was a run-down residence that looked as if it was buried in a field of wild grass . These were not classy folk , unless a car up on blocks is your notion of a yard ornament . Neighbors had complained for years , for all the good it did . " I know the house , but the name does n't mean much . " " You 've probably seen ' em up at Rosie 's . Bucky seems to be a nice kid , though his wife is odd . Her name is Babe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of eye contact . Johnny always looked like he was homeless , but he did all right . " I was beginning to remember the trio he described : old guy in a shabby jacket , the couple playing grab-ass , looking too young for marriage . I cupped a hand to my ear . " You 've been using past tense . Is the old man dead ? " " I 'm afraid so . Poor fellow had a heart attack and died four or five months back . I think it was sometime in July . Not that there was anything odd about it , " Henry hastened to add . ' He was only in his seventies , but his health had never been that good . At any rate , I ran into Bucky a little while ago and he has a problem he was asking me about . It 's not urgent . It 's just irksome and I thought maybe you could help . " I pictured an unmarked key to a safe-deposit box , missing heirs , missing assets , an ambiguity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living inherit from the newly departed . " Sure . What 's the deal ? " " You want the long version or the short ? " " Make it long , but talk fast . It may save me questions . " I could see Henry warm to his subject with a quick glance at his watch . " I do n't want to miss the flight , but here 's the situation n a nutshell . The old guy did n't want a funeral . but he did ask to be cremated , which was done right away . Bucky was thinking about taking the ashes back to Columbus , Ohio , where his dad lives , but it occurred to him his grandfather was entitled to a military burial . I guess Johnny was a fighter pilot during World War Two , part of the American Volunteer Group under Claire Chennault . He did n't talk much about it , but now and then he 'd reminisce about Burma , the air battles over Rangoon , stuff like that . Any way Bucky thought it 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of thing . He talked to his dad about it , and Chester thought it sounded pretty good , so Bucky went out to the local Veterans Administration office and filled out a claim form . He did n't have all the information , but he did what he could . Three months went by and he did n't hear a thing . He was just getting antsy when the claim came back , marked " Can not Identify . " With a name like John Lee , that was n't too surprising . Bucky called the VA and the guy sent him another form to complete , this one a request for military records . This time it was only three weeks and the damn thing came back with the same rubber stamp . Bucky is n't dumb , but he 's probably all of twenty-three years old and does n't have much experience with bureaucracy . He called his dad and told him what was going on . Chester got right on the horn , calling Randolph Air Force Base in Texas , which is where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many people he must have talked to , but the upshot is the Air Force has no record of John Lee , or if they do , they wo n't talk . Chester is convinced he 's being stonewalled , but what can he do ? So that 's where it stands . Bucky 's frustrated and his dad 's madder than a wet hen . They 're absolutely determined to see Johnny get what he deserves . I told ' em you might have an idea about what to try next . " " They 're sure he was really in the service ? " " As far as I know . " I felt an expression of skepticism cross my face . " I can talk to Bucky if you want , but it 's not really an area I know anything about . If I 'm hearing you right , the Air Force is n't really saying that he was n't there . All they 're saying is they ca n't identify him from the information Bucky 's sent . " " Well , that 's true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his records , there is n't any way they can process the claim . I was already beginning to pick at the problem as if it were a knot in a piece of twine . " Was n't it called the Army Air Force back in those days ? " " What difference would that make ? " " His service records could be kept somewhere else . Maybe the army has them . " " You 'd have to ask Bucky about that . I 'm assuming he 's already tried that line of pursuit . " " It could be something simple . . . the wrong middle initial , or the wrong date of birth . " " I said the same thing , but you know how it is . You look at something so long and you do n't even really see it . It probably wo n't take more than fifteen or twenty minutes of your time , but I know they 'd be glad to have the input . Chester 's out here from Ohio , wrapping up some details on his father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it seems like a worthy cause . " Well , I 'll do what I can . You want me to pop over there right now ? I 've got the time if you think Bucky 's home . " " He should be . At least he was an hour ago . I appreciate this , Kinsey . It 's not like Johnny was a close friend , but he 's been in the neighborhood as long as I have and I 'd like to see him treated right . " " I 'll give it a try , but this is not my bailiwick . " " I understand , and if it turns out to be a pain , you can dump the whole thing . " I shrugged . " I guess that 's one of the advantages in not being paid . You can quit any time you want . " " Absolutely , " he said . I locked my front door while Henry headed toward the garage , and then I waited by the drive while he backed the car out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1932 Chevrolet with the original bright yellow paint . Today , he was taking the station wagon to the airport since he 'd be returning with three passengers and countless pieces of luggage . " The sibs , " as he called them , would be in town for two weeks and tended to pack for every conceivable emergency . He eased to a stop and rolled down the window . " Do n't forget you 're joining us for dinner . " " I did n't forget . This is Lewis 's birthday right ? I even bought him a present . " " Well , you 're sweet , but you did n't have to do that . " " Oh , right . Lewis always tells people not to buy a present , but if you do n't , he pouts . What time 's the celebration ? " " Rosie 's coming over at five forty-five . You can come anytime you want . You know William . If we do n't eat promptly , he gets hypoglycemic . " " He 's not going with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his tux . Lewis , Charlie , and I get fitted for ours this afternoon . " " Very fancy , " I said . " I 'll see you later . " I waved as Henry disappeared down the street and then let myself out the gate . The walk to the Lees ' took approximately thirty seconds-six doors down , turn the corner , and there it was . The style of the house was hard to classify , a vintage California cottage with a flaking stucco exterior and a faded red-tile roof . A two-car garage with dilapidated wooden doors was visible at the end of the narrow concrete drive . The scruffy backyard was now the home of a half-dismantled Ford Fairlane with a rusted-out frame . The facade of the house was barely visible , hidden behind unruly clusters of shoulder-high grass . The front walk had been obscured by two mounds of what looked like wild oats , bushy tops tilting toward each other across the path . I had to hold my arms aloft , wading through the weeds , just to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idle moment picking burrs from my socks . I pictured microscopic pollens swarming down my gullet like a cloud of gnats , and I could feel a primitive sneeze forming at the base of my brain . I tried to think about something else . Without even entering the front door , I could have predicted small rooms with rough stucco arches between , offset perhaps by ineffectual attempts to " modernize " the place . This was going to be pointless , but I rang the bell again anyway . The door was opened moments later by a kid I recognized . Bucky was in his early twenties . He was three or four inches taller than I am , which would have put him at five nine or five ten . He was n't overweight , but he was as doughy as a beer pretzel . His hair was red gold , parted crookedly in the center and worn long . Most of it was pulled back and secured in some scraggly fashion at the nape of his neck . He was blue eyed , his ruddy complexion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wore blue jeans and a dark blue long-sleeved corduroy shirt with the tail hanging out . Hard to guess what he did for a living , if anything . He might have been a rock star with a six-figure bank account , but I doubted it . " Are you Bucky ? " " Ye I held my hand out . " I 'm Kinsey Millhone . I 'm a friend of Henry Pitts . He says you 're having problems with a VA claim . " He shook my hand , but the way he was looking at me made me want to knock on his head and ask if anyone was home . I plowed on . " He thought maybe I could help . Mind if I come in ? " " Oh , sorry . I got it now . You 're the private detective . At first , I thought you were someone from the VA . What 's your name again ? " " Kinsey Millhone . Henry 's tenant . You 've probably seen me up at Rosie 's . I 'm there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flickered . " You 're the one sits in that back booth . " " I 'm the one . " Sure . I remember . Come on in . " He stepped back and I moved into a small entrance hall with a hardwood floor that had n't been huffed for years . I caught a glimpse of the kitchen at the rear of the house . " My dad 's not home right now , and I think Babe 's in the shower . I should let her know you 're here . Hey Babe ! " No reply . He tilted his head , listening . ' Hey Babe " I 've never been a big fan of yelling from room to room . " You want to find her ? I can wait . " " Let me do that . I 'll be right back . Have a seat , " he said . He moved down the hall , his hard-soled shoes clumping . He opened a door on the right and stuck his head in . There was a muffled shriek of pipes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower was turned off . I went down a step into the living room , which was slightly bigger than the nine-by-twelve rug . At one end of the room there was a shallow brick fireplace , painted white , with a wooden mantelpiece that seemed to be littered with knickknacks . On either side of the fireplace there were built-in bookcases piled high with papers and magazines . I settled gingerly on a lumpy couch covered with a brown-and-yellow afghan . I could smell house mold or wet dog . The coffee table was littered with empty fast-food containers , and all the seating was angled to face an ancient television set in an oversize console . Bucky returned . " She says go ahead . We got ta be somewhere shortly and she 's just now getting dressed . My dad 'll be back in a little while . He went down to Perdido to look at lighting fixtures . We 're trying to get Pappy 's apartment fixed up to rent . " He paused in the doorway , apparently seeing the room as I did . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a buck . " " How long have you lived here ? " " Coming up on two years , ever since Babe and me got married , " he said . " I thought the old bird 'd give us a break on the rent , but he made a science out of being cheap . " Being cheap myself , I was naturally curious . Maybe I could pick up some pointers , I thought . " Like what ? " Bucky 's mouth pulled down . " I do n't know . He did n't like to pay for trash pickup , so he 'd go out early on trash days and put his garbage in the neighbors ' cans . And , you know , like somebody told him once when you pay utility bills ? All you have to do is use a one-cent stamp , leave off the return address , , so you can save on postage . " I said , " Hey , what a deal . What do you figure , ten bucks a year ? That 'd be hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You never met him ? " " I used to see him up at Rosie 's , but I do n't think we ever met . " Bucky nodded at the fireplace . " That 's him over there . One on the right . " I followed his gaze , expecting to see a photograph sitting on the mantelpiece . All I saw were three urns and a medium-stze metal box . Bucky said , " That green marble urn is my grammaw , and right beside her is my uncle Duane . He 's my daddy 's only brother , killed when he 's a kid . He was eight , I think . Playing on the tracks and got run over by a train . My aunt Maple 's in the black urn . " For the life of me , I could n't think of a polite response . The family fortunes must have dwindled as the years went by because it looked like less and less money had been spent with each successive death until the last one , John Lee , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mantel was getting crowded . Whoever " went " next would have to be transported in a shoe box and dumped out the car window on the way home from the mortuary . He waved the subject aside . " Anyway , forget that . I know you did n't stop by to make small talk . I got the paperwork right here . " He moved over to the bookshelf and began to sort through the magazines , which were apparently interspersed with unpaid bills and other critical documents . " All we 're talking is a three-hundred-dollar claim for Pappy 's burial , " he remarked . " Babe and me paid to have him cremated and we 'd like to get reimbursed . I guess the government pays another hundred and fifty for interment . It does n't sound like much , but we do n't have a lot to spare . I do n't know what Henry told you , but we ca n't afford to pay for your services , " " I gathered as much . I do n't think there 's much I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know more about VA claims than I do . " He pulled out a sheaf of papers and glanced through them briefly before he passed them over to me . I removed the paper clip and scrutinized the copy of John Lee 's death certificate , the mortuary release , his birth certificate , Social Security card , and copies of the two Veterans Administration forms . The first form was the application for burial benefits , the second a request for military records . On the latter , the branch of service had been filled in , but the service number , grade , rank , and the dates the old man had served were all missing . No wonder the VA was having trouble verifying the claim . " Looks like you 're missing a lot of information . I take it you do n't know his serial number or the unit he served in ? " " Well , no . That 's the basic problem , " he said , reading over my shoulder . " It gets stupid . We ca n't get the records because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the information we would n't need to make the request . " " That 's called good government . Think of all the money they 're saving on the unpaid claims . " " We do n't want anything he 's not entitled to , but what 's fair is fair . Pappy served his country , and it does n't seem like such a lot to ask . Three hundred damn dollars . The government wastes billions . " I flipped the form over and read the instructions on the back . Under " Eligibility for Basic Burial Allowance , " requirements indicated that the deceased veteran must have been " discharged or released from service under conditions other than dishonorable and must have been in receipt of pension or had an original or reopened claim for pension , " blah , blab , blah . " Well , here 's a possibility . Was he receiving a military pension ? " " If he did , he never told us . " I looked up at Bucky . " What was he living on ? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitched in . Babe and me paid rent for this place , which was six hundred bucks a month . He owned the property free and clear , so I guess he used the rent money to pay food , utilities , property taxes , and like that . " " And he lived out back ? " " That 's right . Above the garage . It 's just a couple little rooms , but it 's real nice . We got a guy who wants to move in once the place is ready . Old friend of Pappy 's . He says he 'd be willing to haul out the junk if we give him a little break on the first month 's rent . Most stuff is trash , but we did n't want to toss stuff until we know what 's important . Right now half Pappy 's things have been packed in cardboard boxes and the rest is piled up every which way . I reread the request for military records . " What about the year his discharge certificate was issued ? There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tilted his head , reading the box where I was holding my thumb . " Oh . I must have forgot to mark that . Dad says it would 've been August seventeenth of 1944 because he remembers Pappy coming home in time for his birthday party the day he turned four . He was gone two years , so he must have left sometime in 1942 . " " Could he have been dishonorably discharged ; From what this says , he 'd be disqualified if that were the case . " " No ma'am , " Bucky said emphatically . " Just asking . " I flipped the form over . scanning the small print on the back . The request for military records showed various address lists for custodians for each branch of the service , definitions , abbreviations , codes , and dates . I tried another tack . What about medical ? If he was a wartime veteran . he was probably eligible for free medical care . Maybe the local VA clinic has a file number for him somewhere .. " Bucky shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did n't find one . Dad does n't think he ever applied for medical benefits . " " What 'd he do when he got sick " " He mostly doctored himself . " " Well . I 'm about out of ideas , " I said . I returned the papers to him . " What about his personal effects ? Did he keep any letters from his Air Force days ? Even an old photograph might help you figure out what fighter group he was " We did n't find anything like that so far . I never even thought about pitchers . You want to take a look ? " I hesitated , trying to disguise my lack of interest . " Sure , I could do that , but frankly , if it 's just a matter of three hundred dollars , you might be better off letting the whole thing drop . " " Actually , it 's four hundred and fifty dollars with internment , " he said . " Even so . Do a cost/benefit analysis and " You 'd probably find you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apparently unpersuaded by my faint hearted counsel . The suggestion may have been intended more for me than for him . As it turned out , I should have taken my own advice . Instead I found myself dutifully trotting after Bucky as he moved through the house . What a dunce . I 'm talking about me , not him .
