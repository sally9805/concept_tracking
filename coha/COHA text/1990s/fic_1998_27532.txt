PARSIFAL IS DEAD . That is the end of the story . The technician and the nurse rushed in from their glass booth . Where there had been a perfect silence a minute before there was now tremendous activity , the straining sounds of two men unexpectedly thrown into hard work . The technician stepped between Parsifal and Sabine , and she had no choice but to let go of Parsifal 's hand . When they counted to three and then lifted Parsifal 's body from the metal tongue of the MRI machine and onto the gurney , his head fell back , his mouth snapping open with no reflexes to protect it . Sabine saw all of his beautiful teeth , the two gold crowns on the back molars shining brightly in the overhead fluorescent light . The heavy green sheet that they had given him for warmth got stuck in the guardrail lock . The nurse struggled with it for a second and then threw up his hands , as if to say they did n't have time for this , when in fact they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would be dead whether help was found in half a minute or in an hour or a day . They rushed him around the corner and down the hall without a word to Sabine . The only sound was the quick squeak of rubber wheels and rubber soles against the linoleum . Sabine stood there , her back against the massive MRI machine , her arms wrapped around her chest , waiting . It was , in a way , the end of Sabine . After a while the neuroradiologist came into the room and told her , in a manner that was respectful and direct , the one thing she already knew : Her husband was dead . He did not pluck at his lab coat or stare at the floor the way so many doctors had done when they had spoken to Parsifal and Sabine about Phan . He told her it had been an aneurism , a thinning in a blood vessel of his brain . He told her it had probably been there Parsifal 's whole life and was not in any way related to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven off the freeway by a careless teenager changing lanes , the thing that had been scheduled to kill Parsifal had been denied , and Sabine lost the years she was promised he still had . The doctor did not say it was a blessing , but Sabine could almost see the word on his lips . Compared to the illness Parsifal had , this death had been so quick it was nearly kind . " Your husband , " the doctor explained , " never suffered . " Sabine squeezed the silver dollar Parsifal had given her until she felt the metal edge cut painfully into her palm . Was n't suffering exactly the thing she had been afraid of ? That he would go like Phan , lingering in so many different kinds of pain , his body failing him in unimaginable ways -- had n't she hoped for something better for Parsifal ? If he could n't have held on to his life , then could n't he at least have had some ease in his death ? That was what had happened . Parsifal 's death had been easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting what she wanted , what she wanted now was something else entirely . She wanted him back . Sick or well . She wanted him back . " The headache this morning , " the doctor told her , " would have been brought on by a leak . " His beard was not well trimmed and his glasses were smudged , as if set in place by greasy fingers . He had the paleness of so many neuroradiologists . Sabine said she 'd like to see the film . The doctor nodded and returned a minute later holding a large paper envelope stamped DO NOT BEND . She followed him into what looked to be a closet and he put eight large sheets of gray film on the lightboard . Each had fifteen separate pictures , Parsifal 's brain sliced in every conceivable direction . In the dark , narrow room Sabine studied the information , her face painted in a bluish white light . She stared at the shape of Parsifal 's head , at the deep , curving trenches of his brain . In some pictures things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sockets of his eyes . But most of the pictures were patterns , aerial views of an explosion taken at night . Again and again she saw the shadow , the dark , connected mass the size of a pinto bean . Even she could see where this was going . The doctor tapped the obvious with the tip of his pencil . " There , " he said . He faced the light when he spoke , and the pictures of Parsifal 's brain reflected in his glasses . " In some people they stay that way forever . In others they just give out . " Sabine asked for a moment alone and the doctor nodded and backed out of the room . When these pictures were taken , just slightly over an hour before , Parsifal had been alive . She raised her hand to the film and traced her finger around the top line of his skull . The beautiful head she had held . The night Phan died , Sabine had thought the tragedy was knowing that Parsifal would die , too , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabine knew the tragedy was living , that there would be years and years to be alone . She pulled down the films and put them back in the envelope , tucked the envelope under her arm , and tried to remember where the elevators were . The empire that was Cedars Sinai hospital lapped up the last blocks of Los Angeles before it became Beverly Hills . Buildings were connected by overhead tunnels called skyways . Waiting rooms were categorized by the seriousness of the wait . The halls were lined with art that was too good for a hospital . Sometimes it seemed that every wealthy person in Los Angeles had died at Cedars Sinai , or their loved ones had died there , and what they had been left with was not bitterness or fear but a desire to have their name on a plaque over some door . The abundance of money took away as many outward signs of hospital life as possible . There were no sickly green walls , no peeling floors or disinfectant smells . There had been nights when Sabine had walked those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant hotel , the Sahara or Desert Sands in Las Vegas , where she and Parsifal used to perform their magic act years before . But tonight , as Sabine went to the nurses ' station to call the funeral home , it was n't even late ; the sky still had the smallest smear of orange over Beverly Hills . All the people who would one day come to Cedars to die were only beginning to think about going to sleep . Sabine knew what had to be done . She had practice . Phan had been dead fourteen months and fourteen months was long enough to forget exactly nothing . But with Phan it had been different . He had worked towards his death so steadily that they knew its schedule . After the doctor came to the house for the last time and told them a day , maybe two , Phan had died the next morning . With Parsifal , it was only a headache . " I had a dream about Phan , " Parsifal had said that morning . Sabine brought him coffee and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been Phan 's bed , Phan 's house . Parsifal and Phan had lived together for five years . Since Phan 's death , Parsifal had had a handful of dreams about Phan which he recounted faithfully to Sabine , like letters written by a lover in another country . " How 's Phan ? " Parsifal woke up quickly , clearheaded . He took the cup . " He was sitting by a pool . He was wearing one of my suits , my pearl gray suit and a white shirt . He had taken off his tie . " He closed his eyes , searching for details . Phan was in the details . " He was holding this big pink drink , a mai-tai or something . It had fruit all over the glass . He looked so rested , absolutely beautiful . " " Was it our pool ? " " Oh no . This was a capital-P Pool -- dolphin fountains , gold tiles . " Sabine nodded . She pictured it herself : blue skies , palm fronds . " Did he say anything ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm thinking about going for a swim . ' " Parsifal could mimic Phan 's voice , perfect English sandwiched between layers of Vietnamese and French . The sound of Phan 's voice made Sabine shiver . Phan did n't swim . His house had a pool , but pools dominated the backyards of Southern California . Having one was not the same as wanting one . Sometimes Phan would roll up his pants and sit at the shallow end with his feet in the water . " What do you think it all means ? " Parsifal asked . Sabine ran her hand over the top of his head , bald now from who knew what combination of things . She put no stock in dreams . To her they were just a television left on in another room . " I think it means he 's happy . " " Yes , " he said , and smiled at her . " That 's what I think . " There was a time not so long ago that Parsifal never would have told his dreams to Sabine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told her he dreamed about going into the living room and finding Rabbit in the wingback chair , two hundred pounds and six feet tall , reading the newspaper through half-glasses . And maybe he had n't had that dream , maybe he only said it to be funny . But Phan 's death had made him sentimental , hopeful . He wanted to believe in a dream that told him death had been good to Phan , that he was not lost but in a place where Parsifal could find him later . A place with a pool and a bar . " What about you ? " Parsifal said , covering her hand with his hand . " Any dreams ? " But Sabine never remembered her dreams , or maybe she did n't have them . She shook her head and asked how he was feeling . He said fine , but there was a little bit of a headache coming on . That had been eight o'clock in the morning . That had been on this same day .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
