Summon the Tandem , Jeeves , We Wish to Ride By Geoff and Meredith Drake This bike is , bar none , the most expensive test rig I 've ever swung a leg over : $8,500 . Legions of Russian miners slaved for months to extract the titanium used to make this one frame alone ( just kidding ) . If you have a ti obsession , then this gleaming thicket of silver tubes will constitute your ultimate personal statement . Is it worth it ? Hey , they never pose that question about caviar . But it just might be . First , the weight is better than that of some single bikes : 34.1 pounds ! ( Frame weight is 7.3 This makes climbing and accelerating a pleasure . The Axiom 's handling ir impeccable , inspiring instant confidence on descents and in corners . Overall , it 's an easy bike to pilot , even with two big riders aboard , an has none of the twitchiness that cai plague some twicers . This relaxed handling , combine with titanium 's natural shock absorption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All day . A long-distance tour is well within thi bike 's capability , but you 'd need to specify some rack and fender brazeons ( not on our test rig ) . Out-ofsaddle jamming produces some front derailleur rub , but overall the frame has just the right amount of flex . Meredith and I particularly enjoy the Seven on seated climbs , where the lack of weight and pleasant springiness of the bottom brackets make it easy to strike a rhythm . She also likes the spacious rider compartment ( 27-inch rear top tube ) . Do you appreciate the bicycle as a work of art ? Then you 'll like the Seven . Welds are among the best I 've ever seen , and the frame positively resonates with craftsmanship . ( It had better , for that kind of dough . ) Photograph // As for components-while I love the convenience of Shimano Ultegra STI levers ( particularly on a tandem ) , their performance on this bike suffers from too much mixing and matching . First , they 're combined with Specialized cranksets and Quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of front derailleur rub , and makes it hard to find the middle ring in a pinch . ( Shifts across the nine-speed cassette in back are fine . ) Also , the levers are combined with Shimano XT V-Brakes . Such brakes require levers that pull more cable for a given amount of lever movement , and Seven rightly added a Quality Bicycle Products Travel Agent to accomplish this . ( The Travel Agent is a small wheel , attached to the brake arm , that " wraps " more cable . ) Nonetheless , it 's still possible to pull the lever fully back to the bar under hard braking . A better choice for roadies would be simply to spec normal Shimano Dual-Pivot caliper brakes . Fortunately , you spec components through your dealer ; Seven builds frames to order and works through its national network of shops to create a complete bike . Stock frame sizes are offered , but every frame is essentially a custom , says Seven 's founder Rob Vandermark . Frame alone ( no fork ) is $6,000 .
