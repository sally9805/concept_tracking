Section : Cover Story <p> If any single , fundamental rule applies to all investors , it is this : to achieve high returns you have to take high risks . But in investing , as in other walks of life , the more money you have the more easily you can bend the rules . And while $10,000 may not qualify you for the investment big leagues , it does put at your disposal one of the most powerful techniques available for reducing risk without sacrificing return . That technique is diversification . <p> The principle is simple enough . Divide your money properly among a variety of assets , and losses in one part of your portfolio will be at least partially offset by gains in another . But until you accumulate $10,000 , it is difficult to take full advantage of this tactic . To be sure , you could achieve a certain amount of diversification simply by investing in a low-minimum mutual fund , since funds routinely spread their risks among scores of different securities . Some offer even broader diversification : balanced funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio , and so-called asset-allocation funds mix in foreign securities , cash and sometimes gold . Such funds ' allocations , however , may not conform with your own investment outlook and tolerance for risk . For the best fit , you need to design your own portfolio , and that takes at least 10 grand . <p> Even with $10,000 , transaction costs on individual securities limit your investment choices almost entirely to mutual funds . After all , if you divide your money among four different kinds of assets and five different securities in each asset class , you 'd have just $500 to devote to each issue . Buying and selling stocks in such small amounts could incur commissions as high as 20% . But no-load funds  --  those sold directly to investors without sales charges  --  give a $10,000 investor a foothold in as many as five or six markets with no entry or exit costs . <p> The key to effective diversification is to combine funds that react differently to economic events . Growth funds , for example , flourish in a rising economy , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The weight you give each fund in the portfolio also matters . It helps set the portfolio 's risk level and lets you align your investment strategy with your market outlook . <p> For example , Patricia Mooney , a 31-year-old accountant in Seattle , is so optimistic about foreign stocks that , on her broker 's advice , she invested fully half of the $10,000 she received from a maturing CD in an international fund , G.T. International Growth ( 4.75% load ; 800-824-1580 ) . Mooney offset her foreign exposure by dividing the balance of her money between two domestic total-return funds , FPA Paramount ( now closed to new investors ) and Washington Mutual ( 5.75% load ; 800-421-0180 ) . An all-stock portfolio like Mooney 's may be more volatile than many investors would find comfortable  --  especially given the dicey outlook for equities . Mooney , however , plans to hold on to her funds for the long term . Over five to 10 years , her portfolio will have the time to shake off any short-term market setbacks .

Note that we provide phone numbers only once for each fund family . Performance data are for the 12 months to July 1 . <p> PORTFOLIO NO. 1 : PLAYING IT SAFE . $5,000 in Treasury bonds or a bond fund ; $2,500 in a growth and income fund ; $2,500 in a money-market fund <p> Traditionally , portfolios that rely on bonds and cash are the trademark of retirees or other investors who need income , liars blend also makes sense if you need to get at your money within three to five years or if you 're simply nervous about the current stock market , as many people are . Says James Stack , editor of the newsletter Investech Mutual Fund Advisor : " Now is the time to walk softly and carry a lot of cash . " <p> For the cash portion of your portfolio , be guided first by safety , then by yield . Best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with deep enough pockets to make up losses in case of defaults within the fund 's portfolio . One such fund is Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar ( 800-782-6620 ) , which has the added allure of providing a chart-topping yield of 8.8% . The fund 's sponsor , Dreyfus Corp. , has been supporting the payout by absorbing all the fund 's operating expenses . <p> Treasury issues , with their impeccable credit quality , are the most secure choice for your bond allocation . At the moment , three-year notes sport yields that are nearly as generous as those offered by riskier long-term bonds . And if continued sluggishness in the economy allows interest rates to fall , Treasuries investors stand to reap capital gains . If you plan to sell some of your bondholdings in the next couple of years , choose a Treasury fund for the sake of convenience and liquidity . One reliable no-load is Benham Treasury Note Trust ( 800-472-3389 ) , up 6.9% for the year to July 1 , with a current average maturity of 3.8 years . <p> If you expect to hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One advantage is that you avoid fund fees , which typically shave three-quarters of a percentage point or so off your yield . In addition , if you hold them until maturity , Treasuries are sure to return your principal ; funds , which have constantly changing portfolios that never mature , offer no such guarantee . You can purchase four- to 10-year Treasury notes for as little as $1,000 each directly from the Federal Reserve without commission . For details on buying Treasuries directly , call the Federal Reserve Bank in your region . <p> To combat inflation , even retirees need to keep at least a limited presence in the equity markets . Ken Weber , editor of Weber 's Fund Advisor ( P.O. Box 3490 , New Hyde Park , N.Y . 11040 ; $95 a year ) , recommends Selected American Shares ( 800-553-5533 ) , a growth and income fund with a strong long-term performance , despite a rather disappointing 2.7% gain in the past 12 months . <p> PORTFOLIO NO. 2 : TAKING THE MIDDLE ROAD . $3,000 in a balanced fund ; $2,500 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund ; $1,500 in an international stock fund ; $1,000 in a money-market fund <p> If you can afford to salt your $10,000 away for five years or more but prefer to keep a lid on your risk in the meantime , take a look at this conservative growth-oriented portfolio . Over the long run , its small-company funds and internationals figure to pay off handsomely , while the fixed-income hinds will see you through periods of slow growth , such as the current one . <p> Sheldon Jacobs , editor of The No-Load Fund Investor ( P.O. Box 283 , Hastings-on-Hudson , N.Y . 10706 ; $89 year ) , suggests putting your largest single stake into a conservative balanced fund . " This will give your portfolio a stable core , " says Jacobs . His nomination : Vanguard Wellington ( 800-662-7447 ) , up 6.7% , which currently has 62% of its money in stocks with low price/ earnings multiples and 38% in high-quality bonds . <p> To give the mix a more lively growth element than you get from Wellington 's fairly stodgy stockholdings , Jacobs advises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21.6% . One of the steadier performers in the volatile small-stock category , Venture pursues small-company stocks with fast-growing earnings . For the remaining $1,500 of your equity allotment , Jacobs recommends Financial Strategic-European ( 800-525-8085 ) , up 25.2% , which focuses on promising markets in the Old World . <p> To extend the portfolio 's fixed-income portion , Jacobs recommends Scudder Income ( 800-225-2470 ) , up 7.1% , a high-quality intermediate-term corporate bond fund with an average maturity currently of about 11 years . Another $1,000 should go into a low-minimum money-market fund such as Benham Capital Presentation II , yielding 7.9% , since Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar accepts investments no smaller than $2,500 . <p> PORTFOLIO NO. 3 : REACHING FOR HIGH RETURNS . $3,500 in an aggressive growth fund ; $3,500 in an overseas fund ; $1,500 in a bond fund ; $1,500 in a money-market fund <p> There have been more propitious times to deploy your assets for aggressive growth . On the other hand , if you can stand by your stock funds for at least five to 10 years , you are likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than trying to pick the next market bottom . To minimize your risk do n't invest the $10,000 all at once . Ease into your more aggressive funds by committing money during the next 12 months at , say , four regular intervals , whether the market is up or down . This technique  --  dollar-cost averaging  --  will keep you from piling in at what may turn out to be a market peak and generally lower the average cost of your shares . <p> Newsletter editor Ken Weber recommends putting $3,500 into Twentieth Century Vista ( 800-345-2021 ) , up 34.2% , a go-for-broke growth fund with a taste for the stocks of emerging companies . " Small stocks are tremendously undervalued , " he says . <p> Over the next few years , however , your biggest gains may come from overseas funds , which have outpaced domestic-stock funds by an average of more than 10 percentage points a year over the past five years . Charlie Hooper , editor of the Mutual Fund Strategist ( P.O. Box 446 , Burlington , Vt. 05402 ; $149 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For stability , keep the rest of the money in fixed-income investments . Weber suggests allotting $1,500 to SteinRoe Intermediate Bond ( 800-338-2550 ) , up 5.3% , a high-quality bond fund that ranges among corporate , government and convertible bonds . Currently the fund is mainly in Treasuries with an average maturity of 5.4 years . Put the final $1,500 in a money-market fund such as Benham Capital Preservation II . This will serve both as the portfolio 's safety anchor and as a source of ready cash if a weak market drives the other funds down to bargain levels . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Patricia Mooney , a 31-year-old Seattle accountant , took $10,000 from a maturing CD and plunged half into an international fund .
