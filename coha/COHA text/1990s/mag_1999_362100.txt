The last time I went to the bank with a jar of pennies , the teller laughed so hard you 'd have thought I was asking for a loan , not trying to make a deposit . Times have changed . The loan officer is n't friendlier . But the teller accepts every penny I find , and lately I 've been looking under seat cushions . In case you have n't heard , there 's a penny shortage . It 's so severe that a bank in my neighborhood pays 55cents for 50 pennies , and some restaurants offer free desserts to anyone hauling in enough coin . <P> The whole thing is preposterous . Rather than paying a premium to lure pennies back into circulation from jars and drawers , should n't we just eliminate them ? It now costs about a penny to make and ship a penny . Retailer Walgreens figures it loses $1.3 million a year counting them . Pennies are uneconomic and inconvenient . Shortage ? We 've got too many . <P> The U.S. Mint and the Federal Reserve made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pockets around the nation were unable to make change even though the mint bumped up penny production 33% this year . <P> No one knows for sure why pennies are disappearing . A big factor , though , clearly is people 's low regard for the things . Few carry them to spend or are willing to lug heavy sacks to the bank . James Benfield of the Coin Coalition , a lobby group for eliminating the penny , figures that 25% of annual penny production ends up in landfills . <P> When I was laughed out of Citibank with my jar a few years ago , I was told to roll my pennies and write my name and 14-digit account number on every roll . Then the bank would accept them  --  for deposit only , the sum to be held against my account until the bank got around to its own count . The message seemed clear : even banks do n't want pennies . By the way , that penny dish at many checkout points is a nice idea , but it does n't help . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lethal stare of the cashier , who I assume has a penny jar far larger than my own . <P> People who want to keep the penny are either coin collectors , somehow related to the zinc industry ( pennies are 97.5% zinc ) or paranoid that stores will raise prices if we start rounding to the nearest nickel . Yet rounding is in force on military bases and in some foreign countries . Three and four get rounded to five ; one and two get rounded to zero . Even Einstein would be hard-pressed to defeat that system . You round at the end , not item by item , and you would n't round at all if paying by check or credit card . Sure , Dunkin ' Donuts could price a cup of coffee at 98cents and round up . But two cups would cost $1.96 , which means rounding down . And what makes you think retailers do n't already charge as much as they can ? <P> The penny shortage points up an important money lesson . The bank 's offer of 55cents for 50 pennies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal right in front of you that makes the most sense . Your 401(k) plan is one of those . Contribute enough to get the full company match . Of course , most investments require thought . And we 'd have more time for that if we could just get rid of all those pennies . That 's my 2cents . <P> See
