<p> Like any happening town , this one 's got its list of hot restaurants . We went down the list . Then we begged our friends to take us to the places that are n't on anyone 's list , which is where most people eat anyway . Here are some of the winners  --  from family fish houses to sublime sushi bars to early-morning breakfast joints . THE ATHENIAN INN . This is one of those quintessential greasy-spoon diners that apparently has n't changed much since Greek immigrant Papa Papadakis founded the place in 1909 in the heart of Pike Place Market . Beginning at 6:30 a.m. , longshoremen and folks staring at the wrong side of morning plop down on the red Naugahyde stools to load up on hangtown scrambles ( fried oysters and eggs ) , five-egg omelettes and other cholesterol-laden anachronisms . If you 've partied too much  --  or just want to get up at the crack of dawn and contemplate the harbor  --  this is the spot . It 's been a long time since we even thought about corned beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all those hot-list restaurants , it was mighty tasty . Get some crusty hash browns , skip the bad coffee and , if you need it , have a Bloody Mary . Remember " Sleepless in Seattle " ? We do n't , either . But portions of it were shot here  --  and there are photos on the front windows to prove it . Oh , yeah , that 's Papa 's picture over the bar . Pike Place Market , main floor arcade . 206-624-7166 . BLOWFISH . So why ca n't we have places like this in Atlanta ? This reasonably priced pan-Asian hangout has tasty food  --  and it 's cute as a button , too . In a dining room where origami birds swoop down from the ceiling , the Little Mermaid 's friends frolick on mosaic tiles behind an open-air cook space . And thanks to those Japanese pachinko machines , the bar 's got visual pop and a sense of fun ( the state wo n't allow you to gamble , but the game machines provide a lot of noise and atmosphere ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shared like tapas . Some good choices were the hichimi squid with sesame aioli , skewers of prawns with shiitake mushrooms and a plate of ultra-tender grilled asparagus . Especially intriguing , and a meal in itself , was the fried rice with shrimp and that weirdly sweet Chinese sausage . If you need to chill , get a lemongrass lime rickey . A beautiful thing in a tall frosty glass , it 's made from vodka infused with lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves . 722 Pine St. , at the Paramount Hotel . 206-467-7777 . CHINOOK 'S AT SALMON BAY . When you want to get out of the downtown grind and chow down on some honest local food , go to Chinook 's . ( A Chinook , by the way , is a noble thing , being both the name of a Native American tribe and the largest species of Pacific salmon . ) Go for a crab Louie or a chunk of salmon roasted on an alder plank . A purely Northwestern thing , the alder wood imparts a mild zing to the oily pink fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The Louie is an iceberg salad that still hits the spot after all these years ; you can add shrimp , but since you are in Seattle , stick to the Dungeness crab . For dessert , the piece de resistance is the wild mountain blackberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream . These are not commercial berries  --  but wild thangs from the Cascade Mountains . Omigod . Our waitress told us that since her mom was headed to town , and since this was their all-time favorite dessert , they would surely end up here . This is an old-fashioned fish house with a relaxing family ambience ; and it 's fun to watch the boats ease in and out of historic Fishermen 's Terminal . 1900 W. Nickerson St. 206-283-4665 . ETTA 'S SEAFOOD . Chef Tom Douglas is the culinary star of the Pacific Northwest , and you can count on a good meal at any of his three restaurants ( Dahlia Lounge and Palace Kitchen being the other two ) . A friend told me about coming to Etta 's and staying all day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seafood , of course , and Asian and Latin flavors are tossed in with a creative hand . We had a midafternoon snack of pristine oysters  --  Malpeques , Penn Coves , Snow Creek Triploids , Elfin Coves and Salutation Coves  --  and a bracing glass of white wine . Stopping in again one night , we peeled our way through a platter of delicious sea-salty prawns fired with red chilis . And the waitress was nice enough to let us get a half order of peanut noodles tossed with pea vines and ginger-barbecued pork . Which meant there was room for nectarine cobbler and ice cream . The room is lovely and bright at midday ; at night , it takes on a romantic glow that makes it a perfect place to take a date . 2020 Western Ave . 206-443-6000 . EMMETT WATSON 'S OYSTER BAR . Seattle 's first oyster bar was born back in the ' 70s , when newspaper columnist Watson went to New Orleans and got the idea that what his town needed was a few oyster dives . The place is so authentic that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " regional distinction . " In other words , it 's a dump with really good food . The fish and chips are killer , and the salmon soup is truly memorable . A broth like melted garlic is poured over a slab of bread , along with chunks of salmon and a dollop of sour cream . There 's an inviting patio , a laid-back staff , blue-check plastic tablecloths , menus on brown paper bags and Emmett memorabilia ( he still writes for The Seattle Times and likes to call himself mayor of Lesser Seattle , as in : " Tourists , go home ! " ) . 1916 Pike Place , in the rear of the Soames-Dunn Building . 206-448-7721 . SHIRO 'S . Shiro 's is to Seattle what Soto is to Atlanta and Nobu is to New York . Many people say it is not only the best Japanese restaurant in town , but the best  --  period . When we wandered into the clean , well-lighted space , chef Shiro Kashiba was visibly excited about the day 's catch . " Albacore , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of chef you trust absolutely , we asked him to send out the freshest bites . Three courses later , there it was  --  chunks of raw albacore in a glistening ponzu sauce with grated daikon and slivered shiso leaf . Sublime . Baked black cod was sweet and ever so slightly charred at the edge . Just right . The tuna nigiri shimmered like rubies ; the yellow fin was luxurious . With nothing more than some cold sake , these clean , simple tastes reminded us of how sensual pleasures become memories . 2401 Second Ave . 206-443-9844 . WILD GINGER . Walking around one night after a Wagner opera  --  it must have been 1 a.m.  --  we were grateful to find this highly regarded pan-Asian room still cooking . We were smitten by the satay bar , a big grill in the back of the room where you can sit and watch the cook sling out skewers of lemongrass chicken , young mountain lamb , fat , juicy scallops and big ol ' prawns . But as card-carrying noodle slurpers , we were underwhelmed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a place off over one misfire , but this trendsetter should realize there 's plenty of emerging competition in the sea . 1400 Western Ave . 206-623-4450 . GOOD BITES : It 's hard to say which is prettier at Lush Life , the patio or the antipasto platter . But since we could n't eat the patio , we dug the golden beets , the cold mackerel , the olives , cheeses , marinated red peppers and mushrooms . 2331 Second Ave . 206-441-9842 . At Pike Place Market , check out Piroshky Piroshky for pirogis like they make in the old country . If you get addicted , they ship . 1908 Pike Place . 206-441-6068 . In the Capitol Hill neighborhood , there 's authentic Guadalarajan cuisine  --  and lots of big plastic calla lilies  --  at Galerias . We liked the tostaditas with caviar. 210 Broadway East . 206-322-5757 . IF YOU GO Getting there : Fly Delta for $ 318 ( with a 14-day advance purchase and a Saturday night stay ) . Delta reservations : 404-765-5000 . Where to stay : One good way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotline : 1-800-535-7071 . One recommendation is the WestCoast Vance , which is moderately priced and about a 10-minute walk from downtown . The 1920s hotel has newly remodeled rooms that are ideal for the solo or business traveler ( that is , they tend to be on the smaller side ) . $ 110-$ 130 per night . 620 Stewart St. 800-426-0670 , 206-441-4200 . Where to see the salmon jump : The Hiram M. Chittenden Locks at the Lake Washington Ship Canal has a fish " ladder " where you can watch salmon migrating from salt water to their native freshwater spawning grounds . The ladder enables the fish to swim past the dam , and there are observation windows where visitors go eye to eye with chinooks , cohos , sockeyes and steelheads as the fish head back upstream to procreate . There 's also a visitor center and bookstore and a lovely garden . 3015 N.W. 54th St. 206-783-7059 .
