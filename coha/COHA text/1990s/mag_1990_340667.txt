LOVE AND OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES by Molly Haskell <P> Morrow ; 302 pages ; $18.95 <P> Ah , to be sick and have Molly Haskell at the bedside . This memoir by the former film critic for Vogue traces the life and near death of Haskell 's husband Andrew Sarris , film critic of the Village Voice , who is felled by a mysterious virus and confined to New York Hospital for six months . Blessed with a remarkable gift for clarity and self-reflection , Haskell uses Sarris ' illness as a lantern by which she can shine a light on the dark corners of her life : her father 's early death ; what it is like to be married to an acknowledged expert in her field ; her relationship with her mother , who practically moves in with her ; and all the complications and compensations of love . <P> Cosseted by the intellectual hothouse of New York City film buffs , Haskell is unprepared for living a life out of her control . A high achiever accustomed to getting her way , she must now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with the crankiness and sorrow of having someone she loves sick beyond understanding . <P> Haskell throws just enough tantrums to keep us from hating her perfection and offers observations at once trivial and absolutely true . She explains the bargain of married love : " We seek affection , closeness , intimacy , togetherness , a buffer against chaos , then wonder why we no longer experience the frisson of sexual longing . " She fears she may become one of the women waiting in the halls who no longer have husbands " to consecrate the banalities of life , turn them into little miracles of joy . " <P> Haskell , a well-known feminist , comes to appreciate the instincts that link women " with their inborn sense of suffering , " which takes her beyond simplistic movement ideology . " Envy and all the harsh judgments . . . are suspended as we return to some primal bond , where nurturing preceded rivalry . " But as comforting as the bonds forged in the intensive-care unit are , she doubts they can last . " Friendships should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life and death notes of Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony , there 's no place to go from there . " <P> At times , when Haskell goes on once again in her self-congratulatory way about what an erudite , incisive film critic and all-around wonderful guy she is married to , one has to fight the urge to stuff a sock in her mouth . But every few pages , she comes up with an observation so brilliantly right , so original , that one says instead , Molly , pull up a chair and please , please , keep talking .
