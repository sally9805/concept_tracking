The homeowner ( we 'll call him Bob ) was a good , law-abiding citizen . But he had a big mess on his hands  --  or rather , all over his floor . According to federal regulations that took effect a few years ago , Bob had to install a " low flow " toilet in the New York City bathroom he was remodeling . It was a fine idea , in theory . A low-flow toilet cuts down on water bills and helps save the environment by reducing the amount of water in each flush . But the first time Bob used his , the toilet 's flushing action was scarcely strong enough to swallow a wadded-up tissue  --  never mind more organic waste . The thing backed up so often that Bob finally tore out his environmentally correct bowl and replaced it with an outlaw model he found in a warehouse 300 miles away . " It was , " says Bob , " a draining experience . " <P> But hardly unique . Thousands of frustrated flushers have joined what is turning into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models at yard sales . Affluent Angelenos are buying two toilets : a new 1.6-gal. low-flow for show and an old 3.5-gal. tank that they install after the building inspector leaves . " It 's been my biggest call-back , " says contractor David Leonard of Indianapolis , Indiana . One customer required seven trips to service a perpetually clogged low-flow . " I do n't know what this guy eats , " says Leonard , " but we keep having to plunge to get it to pass through . " <P> Toilet manufacturers , who had pushed for uniform federal standards after water-poor states started setting their own , admit they were slow to find good low-flow designs . But their latest models use various tricks  --  wider pipes , extra air pressure  --  to make up in flush power what they lack in volume . That , say bowlmakers , should eliminate most complaints . <P>  --  By Christine Gorman . Reported by Julie Grace/Chicago and Christine Sadlowski/New York
