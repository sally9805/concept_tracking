In 1967 , when I was ten years old , my mother married Harlan Frame , and we moved that summer to a house he 'd bought for us in Slaughter , Texas . <p> Harlan was a farmer , a word my mother found too plain ; she 'd tell people Harlan ranched , though he kept fewer than a dozen cows on a patch of scrub land that was too poor to support a crop . Mostly he farmed wheat and cotton . He would put some acres into sorghum if he thought a booming cattle market might push up the price of feed , but he called sorghum his casino crop because if he guessed wrong he 'd lose what he put into it . It was not like wheat or cotton , he said , where insurance and the government made sure the farmer did n't get too badly hurt . <p> My mother could have done a whole lot worse than Harlan , and probably would have , given half a chance . As far as I know , Harlan is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harlan overlooked the fact that she was divorced and had a child , which was to his credit . In the 196o 's such things mattered more than they do now . Also , my mother was a knockout . She had pale blue eyes and dark hair , and she kept herself thin by eating only every other day . If Harlan had n't come along , someone else would have , and then who knows where we 'd have been ? Worse off , most likely . My mother was easy prey for the unscrupulous because she believed herself to be more knowing than she was . Harlan Frame was the first man to want to marry her , and she said yes . <p> I felt no regret or hesitation about leaving Amarillo , where I 'd grown up , for a farm town where I did n't know a soul . The apartment that my mother and I shared was in an ugly duplex that was set at one end of a parking lot , in a part of Amarillo where there seemed to be a murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man who lived behind us sometimes got drunk at night and argued violently with his wife , and a few times I 'd awakened to the sound of someone quietly turning the knob of our front door , trying to get in . When that happened , Mother would call the police , and we 'd lock ourselves inside the bathroom until they came . <p> I thought that one bad chapter in our lives was ending , and that we would start off fresh in Slaughter and have something like a normal life again . <p> The house we moved into had been let go , and Harlan had to have the roof patched and the outside painted . Mother stripped the bedroom walls of old wallpaper and painted her room mintgreen and mine yellow . She lined the kitchen shelves and drawers with new tack paper , put new curtains up , and cleaned the pinewood paneling and cabinets with lemon oil . She and I spent all of one day cleaning windows with potato halves and crumpled pages from the newspaper , a method she 'd learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beauty parlor . <p> " New carpet , " she said , bending down and squinting through the pane of glass I 'd just cleaned . " That 's the next priority . " Then she straightened and gave me a quick , appraising look ; I imagined I was being added to her list of items that could bear sprucing up . " Well , " she said , crumpling another sheet of newspaper , " Rome was n't built in a day . " <p> I had never seen my mother work as hard as she worked on that house . In the three years since my father left , she had started to take on the habits of an invalid , staying in her bathrobe all day , sleeping in the afternoon . She complained of feeling worn out , and sometimes she 'd lapse into silences that could go on for days . Now she was like a different person , energetic and determined , as if she 'd left that old self behind , for good . We had done without for too long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some part of it . <p> " I was young and stupid when your dad and I got married , " she said . " What we 've got here is a second chance . " <p> My father got interested in visitation rights about the time we moved to Slaughter . By the terms of the divorce , he 'd always had the right to see me two weekends a month , but he had rarely claimed the privilege . I saw him at Christmas or Thanksgiving and the few times he showed up on impulse at the duplex , saying that he wanted us to be a family again . One time he broke down the front door when my mother would n't let him in , and when he asked me if I wanted to come live with him , I said yes . We spent two days in the Starlight Motel in San Angelo , swimming in the motel pool and having food delivered to our room . When he brought me home , a sheriff 's deputy was parked in front of our apartment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all right , and I told her yes . Then she slapped me , hard , across the face . " That 's for worrying me to death , " she said . <p> When we moved to Slaughter , I had n't seen my father in a year . He called the second week we were down there . It was the first time we had heard our new phone ring , and I happened to be standing next to it . I picked it up . <p> " Hey , tiger , " he said . " How 's the new digs ? " <p> I was too surprised , at first , to say a word . " Hi , Dad , " I managed to say , finally , and that caught Mother 's ear . She took the phone away from me and told me to go wait outside . <p> When I came back in , ten minutes later , she was grimly polishing a coffee urn , using toothpaste and old panty hose . She knew I was waiting , but she kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked , at last . <p> She set the coffee urn down and turned to look at me . I could see the faint lines that the conversation with my father had brought out around her mouth and eyes . " Weekend after next , " she said , " you 're going to go see your father . You can ride the bus to Amarillo ; he 'll be there to meet you . " <p> Harlan was an only child . The fact that he had married a divorcee broke his widowed mother 's heart , and she cut off contact with him . Mother and I would see Mrs. Frame creeping down our street in her green Valiant , wearing white gloves and a feathered hat . She 'd let the car drift to the wrong side of the road as she leaned across the front seat to gape at the house . Mother kept the blinds closed so she could n't see inside . <p> " That woman 's going to have an accident , " Mother would say . " Or cause one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heat , watching TV or reading . Harlan left early in the morning and stayed gone until suppertime ; the land he farmed was twenty miles away , too far to be driving into town for lunch when there was cotton to be stripped , and winter wheat to get into the ground . <p> Sometimes I 'd stand in the window in the living room and look out on the street . Nothing moved on still days but the heat waves shimmering above the asphalt ; other days there would be dust storms . Inside the house , on those days , I would hear the wind throw sand against the house , like it was rain . <p> One afternoon , when I was standing in the window , Mrs. Frame drove by . She lifted one white-gloved hand off the wheel and wiggled her fingers at me , tentatively , as if she were afraid the gesture might provoke me . I waved back . <p> Mother and I would go downtown for groceries twice a week , and we 'd stop at the library to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Harold Robbins , while I liked ghost stories and anything to do with flying saucers , the Bermuda Triangle , or the Loch Ness Monster . Slaughter did n't offer much else in the way of entertainment : there was one movie theater that played the same movie for a month at a time , and a bowling alley that was only open in the winter . There was a pretty green park downtown , lush with walnut trees and cottonwoods , that had a fishing pond , two bison penned up in a corral , and a " Whites Only " swimming pool . When integration came , in 1964 , the town fathers had the pool drained rather than let Negroes use it , and in 1967 it was still shut down . If we got tired of being in the house , we 'd go for a drive , and maybe stop at May 's Drive-In for lime Cokes with shaved ice . <p> There was a comic book store next to May 's , where comics with the covers torn off sold for five cents each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place , and would make my mother come inside with me while I picked through the bushel baskets full of comics , looking for the ones I wanted . The old man never greeted us . He sat on a stool up front , with his elbows on the counter , grumbling to himself and running his spotted hands through his yellowing white hair . When I took the comics I had chosen to the front , he would quickly count them , take my money , and hand back any change , all without a word . He seemed to be as eager to get rid of me as I was to be gone . <p> " Goddamn snakes , " I heard him say one day . I looked up to see who he was talking to , but no one else was there . He was sitting at the counter , pulling at his hair as if there were some pain inside his head that he was trying to get hold of . He did n't see me looking at him . <p> Harlan and I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers who had moved by accident into the same house and spoke only fragments of each other 's language . We 'd squeeze past each other in the hall , muttering , " Excuse me " and at night , if I was in the bathroom too long , he would tap lightly on the door and clear his throat . It was rare for us to speak directly , beyond courtesies . He was taller than my father , with thick , roughened hands and knobby wrists . I had noticed how he 'd stand when he was talking to another person-with his weight on one foot and his other hip thrown out to the side-and I realized he did this in order to seem shorter . <p> " Harlan is n't used to being around children , " Mother said . " But he 'll get used to it . You 'll see . " <p> My father had moved into a new apartment complex , where there was a clubhouse and a swimming pool . His apartment had a small back patio ; the first night I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbecue . <p> " Tomorrow , " he said , " I thought we might get kites . We could take a picnic lunch out to a park and fly kites . How 's that sound ? " <p> " That sounds good , " I said . <p> " We could ask Dana if she wants to come along , " he said . " But only if you want to meet her . This is your weekend . We 'll play it any way you want . " <p> " Sure , " I said , " she can come . " <p> He had started telling me about Dana at the bus station , before we 'd even made it to the car . He said they 'd been dating six months and that she had made him take a hard look at his own life . " I was to the point , " he said , " where I just did n't give a shit . I really did n't . Dana changed all that . " <p> He also told me that he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's where he 'd met Dana ; she was the boss 's secretary . <p> The next day Dana came over , and we got picnic stuff and kites and took them to a nearby schoolyard . She was n't what I had expected : I thought my father would have some kind of bombshell girlfriend , but Dana was skinny and had a face like a rabbit-big front teeth and little eyes , set wide apart . Her fingernails were chewed down to the nub , and her fingertips were stained from all the Kools she smoked . She had beautiful red hair , but that was about the best that could be said for her . I thought she was plain old homely . <p> She called my father " sweetie , " and tousled his hair with her fingers while he drove . When we 'd parked in the school 's parking lot , she said , " No , sweetie . Over there , " and made him move the car so we would be five yards closer to a picnic table . <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her kite while she played out the string for twenty yards or so , and when she told me to , I let go , and she took off running . My father and I whooped when the kite shot straight up in the air . Dana turned around and let the string run off the spool until the kite was way up . She knew how to make it dip and dive , and when she 'd helped me get my kite up , she showed me how to maneuver it , and then we had a mock fight , each of us making feints and lunges at the other 's kite . Every time we came close to colliding , she 'd shout , " Hold on , Harold ! " and let out a squawking , surprised laugh . <p> " I have three brothers , " she told me . " That 's how I know this stuff . " <p> She had me take her kite while she ran over to the picnic table to get another cigarette , and when she came back , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bite , but I told him we 're not ready . Unless you feel like pulling the kites in ? " <p> " No ; " I said . " Not yet . " <p> " All right , then . He can just cool his heels . " That night we grilled more steaks , and we made peppermint ice cream in an ice cream freezer Dana brought over . Later we put on our suits and played Marco Polo in the pool . <p> " I 'll let you in on a little secret , " Dana said to me , while we waited by the pool for Dad to bring towels out for us . " But you ca n't tell . " <p> " Sure , " I said . <p> " Your dad 's about to get a big promotion . He does n't know it yet , but he 's going to be making a lot more than he makes now . " Dad was on his way across the pool deck with the stack of towels , and so I nodded , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned closer to me . " You should be very proud of him , " she whispered . <p> Sunday afternoon Dad drove me to the Continental Trailways station . We got there early , bought my ticket , and went back to wait in his car . <p> " I have done one piss poor job , " he said , " as far as being a good dad goes . But I promise things are going to be different from now on . <p> We sat in silence for a minute , and then he said , " I know your birthday 's coming up , and I was wondering if there 's something special that you 'd like to have . " <p> " A telescope , " I said . I had found a book about astronomy mixed in with the comics at the comic book store , and had flipped through the pictures before putting it back . The idea about the telescope had just formed in the instant . <p> " Okay , " he said . " All right . A telescope , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he walked me across the street and hugged me before I got onto the bus . He smelled like the hairspray Dana had got him started using on his hair . " Next weekend you 're up , we 'll go see the motorcycle races , " he said . " Dana 's brother races a Ducati . " <p> When the house was cleaned up and refurbished and all our belongings were unpacked and put away , Mother went out to buy some new things . First thing , she had wall-to-wall shag carpeting put in . Then she bought new appliances , all of them a color she called " avocado green " ; the refrigerator had an ice maker that made ice shaped like half-moons . She bought me a French Provincial bedroom suite , which was more to her taste than mine , and , as an early birthday present , a small color television set . <p> " You need an air conditioner in your room more than you need a TV set , " she said . " But that will have to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> For the living room she bought a new couch , a recliner , and an armchair , all upholstered in crushed velvet , and a walnut console stereo with an AM/FM tuner and a turntable . <p> Harlan showed no sign that he begrudged the money she was spending , or that he felt strapped . He took off his boots and socks and walked around in bare feet on the new shag carpet and admired it . He sat on the new couch , and the new armchair , put his feet up in the new recliner , and said that it was heaven on a stick . <p> But a few years later , Harlan chopped that stereo to pieces with an axe , right there in the living room , and when he finished , he broke my mother 's records , one by one , in pieces , and threw the pieces in the fireplace . She had Sam Cooke records , Ray Charles , Joan Baez , and Barbra Streisand . Harlan said he never wanted to hear another piece of music by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his house again . <p> A package arrived on my birthday , but it was n't from my dad . The address was written out in blue ink , in a trembling , old-fashioned hand . I tore off the paper-brown bags from the grocery store-and inside the box I found a Quaker Oatmeal carton filled with marbles , the locomotive from an electric train set , and three silver dollars . I poured the marbles out onto the carpet and looked through them . I could tell that they were old : glass tiger 's eyes , steelies , blue and white milk glass , several chalkies . There were seven or eight larger marbles , shooters , mixed in with the others . <p> The card inside was meant for someone younger than I , with its drawing of a small boy in a fire engine , a Dalmatian sitting on the seat next to him . It looked like it had been saved in someone 's dresser drawer for years ; the edges had frayed and were starting to turn brown . Inside it said , simply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Later that afternoon Mother and I went to the drive-in for banana splits , and then we went into the comic book store . The old man was there , as usual , behind the counter , grumbling and combing his hair with his fingers . Mother looked through old copies of Life magazine while I went through the baskets . <p> The book that I was looking for was still there-the one about astronomy . I brushed the dust off of it and took it to the front . <p> " How much for this one ? " I asked . <p> The old man picked the book up , turned it over , and then set it back down on the counter . " Take it , " he said . <p> I just looked at him . <p> " It 's your birthday , is n't it ? " he said . I nodded . <p> " Then you do n't have to pay . " <p> Back in the car , I asked my mother , " Did you tell him it 's my birthday ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't . I have no idea how he knew . " <p> That night Mother asked me to show Harlan the presents Mrs. Frame had sent me . I brought them to the kitchen table . He took the top off the oatmeal box and scooped some marbles out with his hand . <p> " These were mine , " he said , " when I was your age . The train , too . I do n't know what happened to the rest of it , but my parents gave me that train for a Christmas present . That was just about the best surprise I ever had . " <p> I hesitated for a moment , then I said , " They 're yours , then . You should keep them . " <p> He shook his head and poured the marbles back into the box . " No , " he said , " they 're yours now . Someday you may want to give them to your son . " <p> Harlan said he had a present for me , too , but that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would let me know when it was ready . Before I went to bed that night , I tried to call my dad , but the telephone just rang and rang , and no one answered . <p> I spent hours studying the pictures and descriptions in that book . There were color plates of galaxies and nebulae and planets . I had never seen a picture of the Horsehead Nebula , in Orion , or the Veil Nebula , with its pink and blue glow . The Milky Way , the book said , was made up of a hundred thousand million stars ; the red spot on the planet Jupiter was actually a storm that had been raging , now , for several hundred years ; the craters on the moon were astroblemes , a word that means " star wounds . " <p> At night I went into the backyard , watched for shooting stars , and picked out the planets and the constellations . Mars was red ; Venus bluish white . I thought about the light that had left the stars a million years or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was looking at a picture of the way the stars were , way back then , and not how they were now . The sky we saw was an illusion , everything had long since changed , but we went right on believing we were seeing things as they are . <p> The week after my birthday I got a postcard from my dad . It was a photograph of him and Dana that they 'd had taken in Las Vegas . They were standing , arm in arm , in front of a display case that contained a million dollars . Dad looked groggy and disheveled ; at his side a bottle of beer dangled from his hand . Dana 's smile was tense and grudging , as if she 'd been forced to pose . She gripped my father 's elbow with both hands and looked directly at the camera , her small eyes narrowed in anticipation of the flash . <p> " We decided to come out here and get hitched , " the postcard said . " Which looks better , do you think-your new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call when we get back to Amarillo . Love , Dad . " <p> Harlan came into my room one morning that same week and shook me by the shoulder . " Get up , " he said , " I want you to see something . " <p> I got out of bed , put on my clothes , and went into the living room . Harlan was standing by the front door with his hat on . " Come on , " he said . <p> The sun was not yet over the horizon , and the sky was just beginning to turn light . But when I looked into the sky , I saw a shooting star , and then two more .. Then I saw three and four at one time , some no more than a brief flash , others a long streak across the sky . I thought , at first , that this was what Harlan had brought me outside to see , but he had already climbed into his truck . <p> We drove south , and as we drove I rolled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower of stars . <p> " They were saying on the news last night that this was starting , " Harlan said . " They said it was a once-a-year deal . The Perseds . Something like that : ' <p> I brought my head back inside . " Perseids , " I said . " They 're named for one of those Greek gods . " <p> Harlan leaned over the wheel to get a better look . " It 's something , all right , " he said . " Never seen so many at one time . " <p> The meteors , I knew , were chunks of rock , debris , that orbited the sun and burned up in our atmosphere when their orbits intersected ours . <p> We pulled off the road eventually , went through a gate , and drove across a rutted pasture towards a rusting tractor shed . Harlan 's cows were huddled there , waiting for the sun to warm them before they wandered off to graze . There were eight or nine cows , Herefords , and one Angus bull . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervously , and I saw a tiny black and white calf , suckling . <p> Harlan let the truck roll to a stop and then shut off the engine . I was n't sure why Harlan had brought me out there . He saw my confusion and said , " That calf is your birthday present . Remember I told you that you 'd have to wait until it was ready ? " " Thank you , " I said . " Thanks . " <p> Harlan leaned his head out of the window and yelled , " Soooeee ! " The cows began to walk towards us . <p> " I thought it would be good for you , " he said , " to raise something as your own . " <p> We sat there awhile and watched the cows . They looked at us with big , wet eyes , dreamy and expectant , as if they 'd been promised something for their trouble . My calf shivered by its mother 's side . Then we headed back to town . I looked out the window at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , green rows of cotton stretching to the far horizon . Meteors etched white lines in the milk-glass sky . Harlan spoke , but I did not hear what he said . I put my head outside and turned my face into the wind . It made my eyes tear , and I had to close them . An alphabet of lights flared in the dark behind my eyelids , and then faded , and my head filled with the empty , rushing noise . I stayed like that the rest of the way home . <p>
