<p> The wind above the Sierra Diablos in far West Texas is the devil 's idle whistling . But to reach the remote peaks and basins of this mean , ragged country west of Van Horn , you must penetrate the melody and fly . <p> Outdoor photographer Wyman Meinzer was on a shoot , riding in a helicopter . " " You get to a certain altitude , and all of a sudden there 's the wind , " he says . " " I had the door off the helicopter and my feet out on the running board , and we got out over where the desert floor rises up , and the pilot said , ' You better get back in here . ' He said , ' Man , this is gettin ' tough . ' <p> " " And , I mean , the helicopter was going boom like this , so I moved all my camera stuff back in , and then just kind of eased out of the slip taking shots . " All in a day 's work for Meinzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , documenting places breathtaking and subtle for " Texas Lost : Vanishing Heritage " ( Parks and Wildlife Foundation of Texas , $ 39.95 ) . <p> With text by Andrew Sansom , executive director of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department , the 160-page hardcover coffee-table book is full of panoramas defined by detail , eroded by wind or human trespass . There is a sense of time 's imprint on this diverse state , from Matagorda Island to the High Plains , from the southeastern bottom lands to Big Bend Ranch State Natural Area . <p> " Texas Lost " is an alarm , a cry for bipartisan attention to Texas ' venerable ( and vulnerable ) features and to the wildlife they support , Sansom says . <p> " " Very little " of the state is pristine today , he writes . Only 5,000 acres , for example , remain of the 13 million that were once fertile black-land prairie between San Marcos and Dallas . <p> One percent is all that 's left of the original coastal prairie , overrun by crops and non-native grasses that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken and a variety of shorebirds to near extinction . <p> The Columbia hardwood bottom lands are being deforested for paper products , and the suburban sprawl west of Austin shares quarters with endangered species unique to the Balcones Canyonlands Wildlife Refuge . <p> Because Texas is 97 percent privately owned , the issues , Sansom says , must be resolved by new coalitions made up of traditional foes . Among them are property owners and government regulators . <p> " " The changing climate in the United States recognizes that landowners need incentives , " Sansom says . " " There 's a lot of emphasis on private landowners ' rights . " It 's a new day . In an agreement announced after the book 's publication , property owners in 18 coastal prairie counties will be exempt from certain provisions of the federal Endangered Species Act if they restore their lands to their original form for a decade or more . <p> Sansom singles out inheritance taxes as the primary threat to Texas wildlife . Their burden speeds the breakup of family-owned property , inviting development or making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax breaks or conservation easements for longtime custodians of the land . <p> " " We have a lot of large ranches and a lot of tradition , and those people have managed to hang on and take pretty good care of it . <p> " " But as people pass away , the land gets continually broken up into smaller pieces . In Lampasas County there 's like 76 of these little subdivisions where someone will go in , buy 20 acres , cut the trees and convert it to Bermuda grass , and all of a sudden there 's no wildlife . " <p> Meinzer understands the problem well . He was raised on a 27,000-acre ranch near Benjamin that is now in six pieces . <p> " " Broke my heart , " he says . <p> Another coalition must be forged , Sansom says , by hunters and nonhunters . " " We 've allowed different points of view to slow us down . For example , Texas is the No. 1 state for hunting , but it 's also the No. 1 bird-watching destination in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that 's ridiculous , because they 're enjoying the same resources , and it will disappear unless they get together and do something about it . " <p> That said , writer and photographer hope " Texas Lost " comes across as upbeat . Parks and Wildlife Department conservation and restoration efforts , Sansom says , are trying to reverse years of neglect or mismanagement . The agency has reintroduced bighorn sheep to the Trans-Pecos region ; 16,500 white-tailed deer have been restored to the East Texas Piney Woods . Matagorda Island has come under the agency 's stewardship . <p> Sansom writes of efforts to save the bottom lands from further deforestation and hopes he 'll stir emotions in the Panhandle toward its timeless , if fragile , beauty . <p> Although people can be part of the problem in fast-growing Texas - the state 's population is 80 percent urban , Sansom writes - their histories and cultures and relationship to the land are equally fascinating . <p> " " People 's way of life is changing , and that 's not only inevitable , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's also what makes it so compelling . " <p> A native of Brazoria County , Sansom graduated from Texas Tech University in 1969 with a degree in parks and recreation administration . Meinzer graduated from Tech five years later in wildlife management . <p> While their time in Lubbock briefly overlapped , they did n't meet until years later . After college , Meinzer became something of a loner , working as a crop adjuster in the summer and indulging his passion for photographing and hunting coyotes in the winter , living alone in a dugout on the rolling plains . <p> Before joining Parks and Wildlife , Sansom jokes , he had " " been thrown out of a long series of places . " Places of distinction , that is . <p> His resume includes stints as special assistant to Interior Secretary Rogers C.B. Morton ; director of conservation education at the Federal Energy Administration ; deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Houston ; director of the Texas Energy Extension Service ; trustee of the Texas Historical Foundation ; and commissioner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by then named one of the top five outdoor photographers in the United States by " Sports Afield " - three months after joining Parks and Wildlife in 1987 . <p> " " We published an issue of our magazine with ( Meinzer 's ) full double-spread cover of an area around Post , which is in the breaks of the Panhandle . It 's one of the most spectacular photos I ever saw . " <p> As executive director of Parks and Wildlife , Sansom in 1991 created the nonprofit Parks and Wildlife Foundation of Texas , which seeks to fund agency programs through private-sector donations and to enhance public awareness of the outdoors . <p> When the foundation agreed to publish " Texas Lost , " Sansom says , Meinzer was his choice to photograph it . <p> " " What really scared me ( was ) it was such an enormous project , " Meinzer says . " " I mean , it was huge . I knew from experience , as any photographer who has been out at all , you could have weather problems that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little challenge to an outdoorsman ? " " I have this philosophy of let 's just roll with it , go . And I had a gut feeling that it was all going to turn out OK . " " " We did n't give him much time , " Sansom says . <p> They wanted to get the book out by year 's end , so planning was done on the fly in the spring , as Sansom was dealing with the Texas Legislature on behalf of the Parks and Wildlife Department . <p> " " We blocked this book out in the corridors of the Legislature , " he says . " " As I was up there working on our budget , Wyman would come through town , and we 'd get together in the corridor and figure out how we were going to put it together . " The book is divided into 17 chapters spanning a variety of ecosystems , landmarks and topographical distinctions that have survived , though not necessarily in their pure form , since the settlement of Texas . Some are specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more general , such as South Texas or the Lower Colorado . And not all are rural ; one chapter is on the Trinity River in Dallas . <p> " " One of the criteria for site selection was to point out that the beauty of our state is not just in far West Texas or in the deep woods of East Texas , " Sansom says . " " One of the most incredible places I have ever been in is Wallisville . We could be there in 40 minutes ( from Houston ) , and it is unbelievable . <p> " " Secondly , we tried to find places which , frankly , people overlook as a conservation objective , places that are more subtle , like the rolling plains . People think of Big Bend or whatever . " <p> " " This book is not a collection of a lifetime or beautiful little pictures , " Meinzer adds . " " It 's not the most beautiful parts of the state . Or , ' This is my greatest shot . ' This thing has a purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in Austin , retreated for several days at a time to a farmhouse in Stonewall provided by Parks and Wildlife Commissioner Terry Hershey . <p> " " Interestingly enough , 20 years ago I did all my best work between midnight and 4 a.m . I used to not even get started until after midnight . I chain-smoked in those days and swilled coffee . I ca n't do that anymore . " <p> So now he went to bed by 11 p.m <p> " " I 'd get up by 5:30 or 6 , fix myself a little breakfast , and I 'd write for a couple of hours . That was the best time . " <p> Then he 'd take his two Labrador retrievers out and work them in the lake for awhile , " " then come back , maybe sweep or clean , do a few chores . I 'd compose the chapters while I was working or walking . " Sansom wrote everything in longhand , compiling several hundred pages . <p> " " I 'm computer illiterate , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The writer and photographer stayed in almost daily contact . <p> " " He 'd call me , " Sansom says , " " it 'd be like 11 o'clock at night : ' I ca n't believe the pictures we got today . ' <p> " " Or I would be working on a chapter , I 'd say , ' Well here 's some stuff that , if you can find it ' So we were kind of plotting it , looking for particular types of situations to portray . " <p> Meanwhile , Meinzer , who took his son along on some shoots , had made arrangements with a network of guides , game wardens , boaters , pilots and private citizens . " " I had people lined up where I could go directly to these locations to minimize time wasted . " <p> His people were especially useful in the eastern part of the state , which he was n't as familiar with . <p> " " It was like , ' OK , Andy , what do I need to see here ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll go there . ' " <p> One sight that stopped Meinzer in his tracks was in the Columbia bottom lands along the lower Brazos , where remaining Civil War-era sugar mills climb above the trees in a privately protected wilderness not far from the encroachment of Houston 's suburbs . <p> " " I tend to steer clear of these real populated areas like Houston , " he says . " " But when we went out there in the brush , I was transported into a whole different century . It was right at daybreak , and the rains had been coming down - and the mosquitoes , and the dripping . We walked through these tall trees , and all of a sudden there were these old sugar mills rising all the way up through the canopy of the trees . I just slipped back in time . It was amazing . <p> " " I would have liked to have sat there for hours and hours to absorb it all . But I could n't . I had to go to work right then because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , and I had to get stuff done before the shadows got too strong . " <p> Unfortunately , the schedule did n't leave much time for contemplation . <p> " " If there had been more time , I would have probably shot a thousand rolls , " says Meinzer , who used but 250 . " " I had to allot myself , like , three days on a site , max . That 's about it , no more . Then make my contact with Andy and go again . " <p> In one 48-hour period Meinzer was up 42 of those hours - driving , shooting and scouting for locations . <p> " " I 'm still tired , " he says . <p> Yet , the weather , which Meinzer called a big roll of the dice , cooperated , to the very last shot on a return visit to Brazoria County . <p> " " I landed in Hobby here , and it looked like a tornado could drop out at any moment . And I thought , ' Well , this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' <p> " " And then we go out to West Columbia , and it was like the clouds kept off in one direction , and we got it . I needed that type of overcast weather for the shot , and I got it . I said I ca n't believe it , it 's over . " <p> But Texas is not captured easily . Its soul is elusive . <p> " " Texas - it 's a peculiar thing , " Sansom says , shaking his head . " " It 's irritating sometimes . <p> " " Matagorda , for example . I 've been visiting that place for 25 years . I 've reread that Matagorda chapter a few times , and every time I read it I think , no , because you ca n't get it . I suspect that 's the same with the photographer . It 's a place you 're in that you ca n't ever quite get it , I do n't think . " But the goals of this book are more prosaic : how to give city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , while preserving - or restoring - its natural state . It 's a delicate balance in a rapidly growing Texas . <p> " " We ca n't rely on any particular public or private institution to do it , " Sansom says . " " It will take everybody . If this can provide any contribution to create that resolve in Texas then it will be worth all the time we put into it .
