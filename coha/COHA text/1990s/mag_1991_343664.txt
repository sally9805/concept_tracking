So the U.N . is squeamish about protecting Iraq 's Kurds from Saddam Hussein 's vengeance . So what else is new ? When has the U.N . ever risked insulting a country 's leader by moving unilaterally to protect the lives and welfare of the people ? Never , that 's when . <P> " Ah , you see , " explained a U.N . official last week as he gleefully paraphrased George Bush , " what goes on inside Iraq is an internal matter . Technically , under international law , the Kurds are n't refugees at all . They are displaced persons . " <P> The lesson here is an old one : There are always enough legalisms to justify inaction . The converse , of course , is also true  --  and the more so in this case . For without significantly torturing their plain meaning , the existing Security Council resolutions constraining Baghdad can easily be interpreted as sanctioning the U.N . relief of the allied forces now occupying a slice of northern Iraq three times the size of Rhode Island . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Javier Perez de Cuellar , the U.N . Secretary-General , has played a neat card : he asked Saddam for permission to police a part of his country . That Perez de Cuellar received the disastrous and predictable answer to a question he should never have asked testifies either to the U.N . ' s underlying unwillingness to do what is right , or to Perez de Cuellar 's fecklessness . <P> In any event , George Bush has made the humanitarian task more difficult by cloaking the U.S. mission in self-defeating rhetoric . Stung by those who say he ended the gulf war too soon ( which is arguable ) and that he moved to aid the hapless Kurds too late after inciting them to overthrow Saddam ( which is n't ) , the President is now bothered about the prospect of U.S. troops getting " bogged down " in a " further military " involvement , a " permanent presence "  --  a " quagmire . " <P> Few words are as loaded as the Q word . Historically linked to Vietnam and defeat , quagmire connotes a limitless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before the gulf war , Bush was at pains to say , " There 's not going to be any long drawn-out agony of Vietnam . " Why he now appears to be the last American still haunted by the Vietnam analogy is baffling . Besides the self-evident  --  America 's Kurdish-aid mission bears * little if any resemblance to anything the U.S. undertook in Vietnam  --  it is Bush himself who has trumpeted America 's gulf triumph as having finally " kicked " the Vietnam syndrome . Perhaps the President 's pique reflects nothing more than frustration : fashioning a new world order is more easily said than done , as Bush is currently discovering in his attempts to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict . <P> How tempting to say " The hell with it , " to walk away . It is certainly past time for others to help police the periphery . If the U.N . wo n't play , then surely the allies should agree to remain there until the Kurds feel safe . Germany and Japan should play a role , if only a financial one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Prime Minister John Major who first drew a distinction between observing a studied neutrality as between , say , Moscow and Vilnius , and seeing to it that Saddam is prohibited from murdering millions of his own citizens .
