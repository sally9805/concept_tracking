LONDON , JUNE 1991 Enter Lord Herrendon Harry Bontecou was tired , but also relaxed . He sat in one of the pleasant , comfortably tatterdemalion clubs patronized by English literati . He had been warned his host might be late for dinner so he had brought along the morning papers . The headline in the Telegraph spoke of the rumored capture the day before of Pol Pot in the Cambodian forests . There were two accounts , one in a news article , the second in the editorial section , telling the minihistory of Pol Pot , sometime plenipotentiary ruler of Cambodia . They differed on the enumeration of Cambodians executed by Pol Pot during the years 1975 to 1979 , when he ruled . The news account spoke of " over a million executed , " the editorial of " two million . " Harry sipped his sherry . He paused then and reflected on ex-actly what he was doing , reading about Pol Pot twenty-five years after the age of the killing fields , drinking sherry . He supposed that there would not ensue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed discussions over which of the two figures was more nearly correct one million killed by the self-designated Marxist-Leninist , or two . The population of Cambodia at the time of Pol Pot 's rule was five million , the Telegraph reminded its readers . So , Harry Bontecou closed his eyes and quickly calculated . The variable estimates meant 20 percent of the population executed , or 40 percent of the population executed . The Telegraph 's account told that Pol Pot 's genocide was the " gravest since those of the Second World War . " Harry reflected . The executions in Nazi Germany might have reached 10 percent of the population ; perhaps an equivalent percentage in the Soviet Union ( twenty-five million shot or starved between 1917 and the death of Stalin in 1953 was a figure frequently encountered ) . Harry remembered his reaction on that winter day in 1946 when it became his job to expedite a genocidal operation . A mini genocidal operation . Now he could read the papers and sip sherry and speak softly and securely in this well-protected shelter for British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , and very dif-ferent those early years . Now he could focus on the statistics , on the round figures . Now he was Harry Bontecou , Ph.D . History . The Telegraph noted also the transatlantic debate over whether Marcus Wolf was entitled to a visa to visit the United States . Herr Wolf , the paper reported , was indignant at having been held off . He had served as chief of intelligence for the Democratic Republic of Germany , which no longer existed . But when it did , East Germany 's mission had been to do the will of Moscow . This included guarding the impermeability of the Berlin Wall . That was a special responsi-bility of Marcus Wolf , Harry knew he scanned the story , would the reporter mention the wall ? No . He went back to the paragraph reporting Wolf 's displeasure . Harry knew , as did how many members of the Garrick Club ? 70 percent ? 10 percent ? that as Secret Police ( Stasi ) chief , Wolf had engaged in the torture and killing of anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , tried to escape from the Democratic Republic of Germany to West Germany . Marcus Wolf had taken considerable precautions to dis-courage trespassers to freedom . They included land mines and elec-trical fences and barbed wire and spotlights and machine guns and killer dogs . Now , in the morning paper , Wolf was reported as saying he did not understand being persecuted for carrying out a routine professional assignment . " I did n't kill anybody personally , " he told the reporter . Neither did Hitler , Harry reflected . He was jolted by the hortatory tone of voice from a figure standing by the bar , who now , drink in hand , approached him , an elderly man stylishly dressed in dark gray . His abundant white hair framed an angular face with heavy tortoise-shell glasses that magnified the light blue eyes . Oh , my God , Harry Bontecou thought , Tracy . His freshman-year college roommate . " Say . " The insistent tone was off register in the quiet of the Garrick Club . One had the impression the leather volumes winced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Harry Bontecou ? " Harry was irritated by the question . To begin with , the tired formulation , " Did n't you used to be ... " Harry remembered that phrase used in the title of a book published in the 1960s , an autobiography of George Murphy . The author had been a genial Hollywood song-and- dance entertainer in the memory of an entire generation of moviegoers , and suddenly he was junior senator from the state of California . Clever title back then . In the 1960s ; not funny in 1991 . There was that , there was the imperious tone of voice , and there were the memories , many of them ugly , of the man who now addressed him . Harry remained in his chair but extended his hand . " Hello , Tracy . How you doing ? " " I 'm fine , old boy . And you ? I 'll buy you a drink . What will you have ? " " Nothing , thanks . You living in England , Tracy ? " " Yes , old boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , please , Harry thought . Four decades had gone by . He would not take the bait . He had had more than enough , back then . Back in the years of the Korean war , of the rise of Mao Tse-tung , of the Soviet explosion of an atom bomb , of the Berlin blockade , the campaign of Henry Wallace for president . Above all ... the years of Joe McCarthy . His mind turned determinedly to the likeliest way of avoiding the old subject . " Yes , indeed , Tracy , " he said submissively . And then quickly , " Trust everything is okay with you . Come to think of it , the last time I got any word about you was from the Washington , D.C. , police . " " Oh ? " " Yes . After your surprise ... visit to me ... after they escorted you home , they reported the next day that you were in law school and evidently had excess energies to spare . " Harry did not tell him about the other call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well for you , I gather . " " Well , I manage to make ends meet . " Tracy Allshott extended his hand toward a waiter , who knew to bring him another drink . " You would discover this , dear Harry , if ever while in London or , for that matter , anywhere else in the world you needed a lawyer , and someone was benevolent enough , notwithstanding your Redhunting past , to give you the name of the ... best in America or in London you would learn that I am indeed ... paying my bills ! Though if you came to me as a client , perhaps I would give you a compassionate discount , as a member of the Columbia class of 1950 . " Talks rather more than he used to , Harry reflected . On the other hand , Allshott had clearly been drinking . " That would be nice , Tracy . " He permitted his eyes to wander over to the entrance of the lounge . Tracy did not miss the meaning intended . " But you are waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached over to an adjoining table , drew a chair alongside , and sat down . " Evidently your host has not arrived yet . So I will take the opportunity . I am writing my memoirs , and I thought to try to dig up an address for you . I want in my memoirs to talk about Senator McCarthy . " " Which Senator McCarthy ? " Harry asked , affecting innocence , though knowing it was fruitless . Clearly , with his background , Tracy was not talking about the other McCarthy . Eugene McCarthy , sometime senator from Minnesota , had derailed President Johnson in 1968 and soon after resigned political office to go back to his poetry . Harry might as well have asked , " Which Pope John Paul ? " " Do n't waste my time , Harry . My assistant , after a few minutes in the library , confirms my impression : that after Presidents Truman and Eisenhower , your Senator McCarthy was the dominant figure in the United States from 1950 to 1955 . " " I will not deny that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salons of history were assembled there to hear his charge . His voice was oracular . " Senator McCarthy was , by the consolidated holding of history , the most dangerous American of the half century , a savage , unscrupulous , fascistic demagogue " " Tracy . Would you please go away ? " " You do n't want to talk about Joe McCarthy . " Allshott 's voice was insistent , the words rapidly pronounced . Now he paused . " I do n't blame you . " He rose from his chair . " We 'll leave it that there were those of us back in the fifties during the anti-Communist hysteria who were farsighted and courageous enough to resist McCarthy and McCarthy-ism . " " Congratulations , " Harry said , lowering his eyes to the newspaper . " All right . I 'll let you alone . But you 're going to have a place in my memoirs , Harry . Harry Bontecou , the young McCarthyite . You 've never written about those years . But I 'm not surprised . What the hell would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said nothing , keeping his eyes on the paper . Tracy Allshott hesitated only a moment , and then turned and walked back to the bar . Harry 's eyes stayed on the newspaper , but they did not focus . It had been a long time since the subject of Joe McCarthy had been raised . But the memories would never entirely dissipate . When McCarthy died , Pol Pot was a young Marxist student in Paris ; Khrushchev had succeeded Stalin as general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , the most exalted office in the Soviet empire ; Dwight David Eisenhower was one year into his second term as president . And Harry But again he was interrupted . This time by his host . " We 've never met . " Lord Herrendon extended his hand .
