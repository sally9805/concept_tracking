<p> Q. I saw " Starship Troopers " last week , and I was wondering : If the humans have guns and the aliens have no projectiles , why do the humans run up to the beasts to get slashed up ? Are they too dumb to keep a safe distance ? Peter <p> Krouzelka , Vancouver , B.C. <p> A. Yes . We 're not talking rocket science here . Well , actually , we are , but . . . . <p> Q. The credits for the movie " Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil " refer to the book the movie was adapted from as a " novel . " I always thought that the book was presented as nonfiction , yet when I referred to a copy of the book I found that it was being referred to as a " non-fiction novel . " What exactly is a " non-fiction novel " ? <p> Bruce Worthen , Salt Lake City <p> A. Dominick Dunne 's best seller about the Simpson trial , A City Not My Own , occupies the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book begins with facts , which the author manipulates for greater dramatic effect . Midnight author John Berendt actually first visited Savannah , Ga. , after the alleged murder was committed by Jim Williams , but for greater effect caused it to happen after the character was established . <p> Q. In your book Questions for the Movie Answer Man , you were n't able to determine which movie was the first to use the " F-word . " According to the Psychotronic Video Guide and Marianne Faithfull 's autobiography , it was an English movie , " I 'll Never Forget What 's ' is Name , " directed by Michael Winner in 1967 . The word was spoken by Faithfull . <p> Peter Sobczynski , Gab and Velocity <p> magazines , Chicago <p> A. Are you sure that title was n't " I 'll Never Forget What 's ' is Bleeping Name " ? <p> Q. I read in your Questions for the Movie Answer Man book that the movie that used the " F-word " the most was Martin Scorsese 's " GoodFellas . " It is probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Scarface " should be first . A popular drinking game among my friends is to watch " Scarface , " with the rules that every time the word is used , you have to drink . After the first half hour of the film , everyone is too drunk to concentrate . <p> Josh Korkowski , Dayton , Minn . <p> A. " Scarface " ends with powerful anti-drug images , if your buddies are ever conscious long enough to absorb it . <p> Q. Have you heard anything about " Mononoke Hime " ( " Princess Mononoke " ) , the Japanese animated film that broke the Japanese box office record set by " E.T . " ? Disney plans to release it in the States next year . There 's a theater across the street from my school . Every afternoon for the last three months , there was a line outside the theater . The animation is amazing , very realistic . Jason Chau , Niigata , Japan <p> A. " Princess Mononoke " is said to be the last film planned by the great Japanese master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) . According to RoboGeek , a Web-based expert on anime ( the Japanese style of animation ) , it has grossed $ 140 million in Japan , and broke the box office record four times faster than " E.T . " A 10th of the population has seen it . ( Disney 's top grosser in Japan , " Aladdin , " took in $ 19.7 million ) . Disney will release the film in the United States , but since it 's R-rated , it may be handled by the studio 's Miramax division , perhaps opening next spring or summer . RoboGeek writes in a report for the " Ai n't It Cool " Web site that " it 's a sweeping , bloody epic adventure , set in the Muromachi period ( 1333-1568 ) . It tells the tale of a war between the ancient gods and man for dominion over nature . " It 's 133 minutes long , took three years to make , and " consists of 144,000 hand-drawn cels  --  some 80,000 were drawn by Miyazaki himself . " There 's feverish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be " Star Wars " and " Braveheart " wrapped up into one . <p> Q. Recently the Charles Chaplin estate has been allowing " City Lights " to be shown with a live orchestra playing the score . This necessitates taking Chaplin 's original track off the film ( or at the very least shutting it off ) . Lately it 's been revealed that there are even prints of the film with the Carl Davis-conducted recording actually on the film  --  replacing Chaplin 's original music track . It is reportedly the intention of the family that both versions will be available for rental . I do n't know about you , but this strikes me as deplorable . " City Lights " is not a silent film . Chaplin 's original music track is an integral part of that film , and for the estate to rip it off the film amounts to the musical equivalent of colorization . <p> Tom Moran , New York City <p> A. Chaplin released the film in January , 1931 , with no dialogue ( except for some squawks and sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soundtrack . Conductor Carl Davis , who collaborated with Kevin Brownlow on restoring the film , re-recorded the same score around 1990 , and it is this version that 's heard on most video versions of the film . Davis said he thought Chaplin was " not very satisfied " with the original film version : " It was the beginning of sound recording . The splendor that he heard in the recording studio contrasted with the sound he heard on the film . " My feeling ? I 'd like a laserdisc or DVD with both versions on alternate soundtracks . Performing the score live is a way to make a screening more special , will happen only rarely , and does n't much bother me . ( " City Lights " will be next week 's selection in my Great Movie feature . ) <p> Q. I am the person who posted Kevin Smith 's original script for the new " Superman " movie on the Web . I wonder how you feel about the methods I used to get the script out to the public . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , and subjecting myself to a lawsuit from Warner Bros . I did , indeed , receive a cease-and-desist letter from them , but do you think the public deserves to have the opportunity to read such a well-known and much-talked-about script ? <p> Jason C. Charnick , Bronx , N.Y . <p> A. A script in development has the same legal status as a commercial or trade secret . Legally , you had no right to do it , and WB would have won in a walk if they had sued you . The desire of others to read the script , Kevin Smith 's reputation , etc. , are all irrelevant : This is pretty much an open-and-shut case . Nice script , though . Wish Tim Burton had liked it more . <p> Q. I saw the original " Superman " movie on cable recently and was surprised to see scenes I 've never seen before . These included : When Superman is trying to get to Lex 's underground hideout , he is subjected to machinegun fire , a giant blow torch , and is frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes . Lex feeds Miss Tessmacher to some lions ( Superman saves her , of course ) . Where have these scenes been hiding all this time ? <p> Matthew Gurvitch , Brooklyn , N.Y . <p> A. Film expert Ed Slota , a member of the CompuServe Showbiz Forum , says , " What happened here was , in the mid- ' 80s , ABC-TV bought the network broadcast rights to ' Superman . ' Their deal included all the footage that was cut from the theatrical print , which ABC reinserted in order to stretch the movie into a two-night ' event . ' This is the print you saw . As far as I know , this footage has never made it into the video prints . " <p> Send questions to Roger Ebert 's Movie Answer Man , Chicago Sun-Times , 401 N. Wabash , Chicago 60611.
