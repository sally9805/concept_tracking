Section : Business Business is teaching government how to give taxpayers more for their money <p> Xerox senior manager WC Enmon spends his days training work teams in customer satisfaction , quality measurement and process redesign . That should come as no surprise . The Stamford , Conn. , corporation has been using such total-quality concepts for 10 years to fight Japanese competition and win back market share , from a low of 10.3 percent of the U.S. copier market in 1985 to 17.6 percent in 1991 . But Enmon is not working with Xerox employees ; he is putting these corporate tools in the hands of the 226,000 civil servants and executives of the Texas state government in Austin . The Xerox-paid special adviser to Democratic Gov . Ann Richards acknowledges that government can not be run exactly as a business , but he believes the same techniques that helped improve copiers will better the efficiency and service of government . We 're talking about delivering service that meets the customers ' needs , ' says Enmon . It does n't matter whether it 's a widget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lauderdale , Fla. , to Fort Collins , Colo. , from Oregon to Ohio , state and local governments have begun seizing upon the business concepts that American companies began using in the 1980s to reform their own stifling corporate bureaucracies . The new buzzwords of the boardroom  --  empowerment , customer-driven , teamwork and especially total-quality management  --  are increasingly becoming the mantra in council chambers , statehouses and pockets of the federal bureaucracy . In the past six months alone , 1,000 inquiries have poured into the offices of the Public Sector Quality Improvement Network , a Madison , Wis. , group that teaches business principles to government leaders . And the platforms of candidates in eight of the 12 gubernatorial elections this month had planks featuring entrepreneurial government . <p> Intensifying this trend was the publication this year of Reinventing Government , ' by David Osborne and Ted Gaebler , which spotlights many of the cities , states and federal agencies where practices honed in the private sector are saving taxpayers ' dollars and making the phrase government work ' a label of pride , not derision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hierarchy , ' says Meryl Libbey of Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government , but that 's not the way it 's happening among the more innovative local governments . There really is a sea change taking place . ' <p> Many observers believe the tide is about to sweep Washington as well . In Arkansas , Gov . Bill Clinton established what is widely considered the most advanced total-quality-management program in state government , enlisting the assistance of a local Eastman Kodak division . Quality executives in Little Rock brag that Clinton even left the campaign trail for a day to attend a meeting of his quality team ' in May . The president-elect has also consulted repeatedly with Osborne , whose book Clinton has praised ( box , Page 55 ) . While the next leader of the federal bureaucracy has been short on specific plans , his national economic strategy promises 3 percent administrative savings in every agency and a 100,000-position reduction in the bureaucracy , enhanced by a shift from top-down bureaucracy to entrepreneurial government . ' Clinton could find an unexpected ally in House Republican Whip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican governors optimistically estimated that total-quality management could save 15 to 25 percent of the cost of government over five years . <p> Government waste . Falling profits woke business up to the need for change , but government is responding to tax-revolting voters who refuse to pay another dollar for less than a dollar 's worth of service . Seventy percent of Americans believe that when something is run by the government , it is usually inefficient and wasteful , according to a recent Times Mirror poll . Business , too , has tired of paying more and getting less , which helps explain why such companies as Xerox and Kodak have been so eager to share their expertise . Florida Power &; Light , the only American company to win Japan 's coveted Deming Prize for quality , for example , is acting as a mentor for the Florida government 's efforts to reform its bureaucracy . Whatever we can do that helps the state , ' explains Dale Butler , an FP &L; supervisor , could have a tremendous impact on our tax costs . ' <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their monopoly is no longer safe . A survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures found that nearly 60 percent of legislators now favor privatizing traditional government activities . The public sector is increasingly faced with the option of learning from business or being replaced by it . Government has to change the way we operate , ' says Steve Burkett , city manager of Fort Collins . We are going to have to become more productive . ' <p> To make real productivity gains , politicians are learning , corporations had to change their very shape . Executives became obsessed with flattening their organizations in the 1980s as they came to realize that information and decisions were slowed and garbled as they moved up and down each additional layer of management . The solution was to put more decisions in the hands of lower-level employees who can act on them quickly , while eliminating the need for several layers of supervisors . At Motorola 's semiconductor division in Phoenix , for example , empowered teams ' now set their own production schedules as they prepare batches of specialized computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the chain of command , most Motorola units in Phoenix have eliminated at least two layers of management . Executives credit the improved productivity and responsiveness with helping reverse Motorola 's slide in worldwide semiconductor market share , which has grown over the past two years , while revenues have risen $600 million . <p> Flattened . Across town , Phoenix Mayor Paul Johnson is n't much worried about market share , but he is equally enthusiastic about altering the hierarchical bureaucracy of city government . Phoenix has studied Motorola 's success , and Johnson now boasts that the city serves more people today with 450 fewer employees than it had three years ago , largely because of cuts in senior- and middle-management positions . The mayor is particularly emphatic that decisions not get passed from desk to desk , a lesson he learned battling red tape as the owner of a local construction firm . <p> In the past , for example , when Phoenix building inspectors came across uncertain situations that required them to interpret the building code , they would routinely refer the question up the chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Developers would have to put parts of a construction project on hold while waiting for a decision , which was usually based on the advice of the inspector anyway . Today , inspectors make similar decisions on the spot , or refer them to their immediate supervisors , saving developers tens of thousands of dollars . Such improvements have led to a drop in customer complaints at the Development Services Department , despite a 23 percent reduction in staff . <p> In most government agencies , the number of complaints coming over the transom is not followed very closely , but a new vanguard of entrepreneurial governments is taking up the customer revolution begun by corporate America in the early 1980s . In Phoenix , every department has conducted customer focus groups in the past six months . The city of Fort Lauderdale hopes to polish its image by putting parking enforcers , who often deal with irate tourists , through customer training . Fort Collins annually sends out surveys to 1,000 of its citizens . Says City Manager Burkett , We can have all kinds of data about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's lousy , we 're not achieving our goal . ' <p> Productive police . If the Reno , Nev. , Police Department had been interested in customer service in the early 1980s , it would have found an ideal model close at hand . Harrah 's Casino Hotels was then developing what is perhaps the most extensive customer-service data collection system in its industry . Nearly 2,000 visitors are surveyed by phone each year after returning home from Harrah 's , while thousands more are interviewed on site . The results are tracked monthly . But the Reno police were more interested in writing tickets than reading surveys . Accidents rose in the early and mid-1980s . Reno cops , armed with 21 new radar units , more than doubled the number of traffic citations . But the accident rate refused to budge , and in 1986 and 1987 angry citizens turned down two ballot-box proposals that would have increased police funding . <p> With some advice from Harrah 's , Reno police have begun listening to their customers . More than a thousand citizens are surveyed each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many intersections have been improved . Police are no longer encouraged to write tickets in random locations , instead targeting sites with large numbers of accidents or customer traffic complaints . Today , 9 of 10 Reno citizens approve of the department , up from 4 of 10 in 1988 . And though ticketing is down , the accident rate fell 20 percent in the first six months of 1992 . <p> In their pursuit of satisfied customers , American companies in the 1980s sought out the teachings of W. Edwards Deming , the quality consultant many Japanese industrialists credit with their success . One of the key tenets of his philosophy of total-quality management is music to the ears of government workers weary of the stigma of the lazy bureaucrat : Of any problem with quality or efficiency , 85 percent or more lies within the process , not the people who work it . Bob Garda of McKinsey &; Co. finds that 10 to 20 percent of the costs can be wrung out of a process  --  in business or government  --  by redesigning it . We have good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaebler . They have to go . ' <p> Out on a limb . The tree trimmers of the city of Cleveland would agree . For as long as anyone could remember , several tree crews had crisscrossed the city daily , pulled away from routine trimming tasks to handle emergency requests . When Garda studied their movements in the late 1980s , he found that they were actually working with trees only five hours of the day , spending much of the other three hours in traffic . Garda recommended that one crew be assigned to emergencies , while the others stick to their assigned trimming jobs all day . As a result of such changes , the department now services more trees with 18 people than it could in the past with 27 . Productivity has risen 43 percent while citizen complaints have fallen 63 percent . <p> In the front-running governments that are using Deming 's total-quality management seriously , government workers themselves are finding ways to improve the efficiency of their work systems . Arkansas has sent more than 5,000 of its 32,000 employees  --  from Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sessions where they are taught how to chart work processes , measure results and redesign for efficiency . One team of workers from the motor-vehicles office studied how to speed the turnaround of license-plate renewals , which were generating weekly complaints from citizens who were waiting up to three weeks for their certificates and decals . The team decided that rather than saving up renewal requests so that new registration certificates could be batch-printed on the weekend , they could simply attach computer-coded stickers to the old certificates as they arrived . All renewals are now mailed out within a day , while the department saves $10,000 a year on forms alone and even more on printing . <p> If Clinton promises to do for America what he has done for Arkansas , how large a revolution could he stir in the halls of the Washington bureaucracy ? The new president may find himself too preoccupied with reviving the stagnant economy to make any early , bold moves toward creating a more entrepreneurial federal government . And if he does , he will find all manner of obstacles in his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Motors and IBM combined , with a civil-service system rewarding a manager for running a bigger staff , not a more efficient one . <p> Nonetheless , at the Federal Quality Institute , an appendage of the Office of Personnel Management , the change in leadership has sparked hope . Director Don Mizaur , whose staff has spent five years as the federal government 's principal cheerleader and catalyst for total-quality management , says that Washington is not seeing the bottom-line , measurable results that some people expected . ' The private sector has turned in more impressive results , adds Mizaur , largely because in companies these things are primarily led by the CEO . ' But expectations are rising once again in Washington ; a new CEO is on his way from Little Rock to the White House . <p> <p> Empowering the front line Building inspectors <p> Phoenix Corporate tactic : Moving decisions to lower levels for speed , efficiency <p> Put into practice : Field inspectors have been trained to make building-code decisions that were once passed five levels up the chain of command . Decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot . <p> <p> Pleasing the customer Traffic police Reno , Nev . <p> Corporate tactic : Orienting work around customer desires <p> Put into practice : Reno police found that simply issuing more tickets made residents angry without reducing accidents . After soliciting the advice of their customers , ' traffic cops found more targeted and less offensive ways to control traffic , such as this speed-monitoring sign . Citizens are happier , and accidents are falling-down 20 percent in the first half of 1992 . <p> <p> Cuting waste from the process Tree-trimming crews Cleveland <p> Corporate tactic : Redesigning the work process in search of efficiencies <p> Put into practice : When business consultants examined the way Cleveland cut trees , they found crews spending almost as much time driving from site to site , stuck in traffic jams and waiting at the gasoline pump as they spent trimming trees . The problem was not laziness but organization . With a better schedule and division of labor , productivity rose more than 40 percent . <p> Picture : Hard-headed efficiency .
