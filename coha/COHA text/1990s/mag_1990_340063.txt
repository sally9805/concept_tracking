General Michel Aoun , the renegade Christian strongman who considers himself Lebanon 's rightful leader , was spoiling for a fight . Irritated because his fellow Christians in the Phalangist militia were tacitly supporting a peace agreement giving authority to President Elias Hrawi , Aoun last week ordered his troops to attack Phalangist barracks . When the Phalangists struck back , the result was a civil war within a civil war that turned the Christian enclave of East Beirut into a free-fire zone . By week 's end more than 140 civilians were dead . <P> Aoun , who commands 15,000 troops , apparently underestimated the 10,000- strong Phalangists , who not only held their own but overran a naval base , a landing strip and an army garrison held by Aoun 's forces . <P> Nasrallah Sfeir , the patriarch of Lebanon 's Maronites , the country 's largest Christian group , pleaded in vain for the factions to stop fighting . " This is suicide , " he lamented .                 @ @ @ @
