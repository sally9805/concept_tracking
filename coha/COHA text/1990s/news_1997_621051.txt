<p> When I went to New Orleans about six years ago , all the locals were abuzz about a new restaurant , Mike 's on the Avenue . <p> In a town with a long dining tradition , chef Mike Fennelly was shaking up the staid Cajun-Creole fare by adding Southwestern and Asian influences . <p> His 170-seat restaurant there has been going strong since 1991 , and he plans to check in on it from time to time , but Fennelly now lives in Sausalito and owns Mike 's on Post in San Francisco , in the space that previously housed Barbara Tropp 's China Moon Cafe . <p> Fans of that restaurant will recognize the stylish Art Deco diner , where wooden chopsticks fill vases on each table . The new owner has merely turned the celadon walls a deep red and painted the trim black . The booths down one side and the long counter remain , as does the open kitchen tucked into the corner in front of the large glass window overlooking Post Street . <p> Fennelly , who has no formal training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School of Design , continues to create his distinctive cross-cultural style here , but he 's emphasized the Asian influences even more . For example , barbecued shrimp sits atop a crisp noodle pillow , and crayfish find their way into crunchy spring rolls . <p> When chefs start mixing cuisines with such abandon I get nervous , but Fennelly pulls it off much better than I expected . One of the most unusual-sounding dishes is an aromatic duck and scallion quesadilla ( $ 6.50 ) filled with fresh mozzarella and accompanied by chipotle plum jam . Cheese in Chinese food ? Tobacco nuances of dried chiles in a fruit sauce ? Sounds strange , but I quickly became a convert . The filled toasted wedges were accompanied by a sliced pickled jalapeno and a corn relish with coins of baby corn and tiny dices of red peppers and carrots . Tucking both of these elements into the gooey mixture made it even better . <p> Crayfish spring rolls ( $ 5.50 ) , filled with shreds of cabbage , spinach , red onions and red peppers and fried to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The waiter told us the chef recommended that we wrap them in lettuce leaves with mint , a bit of the accompanying thread-like noodles and a dash of chile sauce . That sounded great until we noticed we had eight pieces of spring roll and only one leaf each of butter and romaine lettuce . While the greenery lasted , it provided a marvelous contrast of texture and temperature ; by themselves the elements were n't nearly as good . <p> MARVELOUSLY JUICY DUCK <p> At first we thought that was an oversight , but just about everything that needed to be stuffed or wrapped in something was served the same way , including the fragrant duck breast with a crisp maple ginger skin ( $ 18 ) . The marvelously juicy slices of duck , fanned on the plate with snow peas and thin slices of radish , were advertised as being served with steamed " buns . " The word should have been singular . Cut in quarters on the right side of the platter , the bun looked more like a garnish than an integral ingredient . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicious mu-shu pork ( $ 18 ) . We had only two for the huge pile of julienne pork with green onions , mushrooms , carrots , red bell peppers and ginger , although the waiter brought another one over after we had already finished the heap of smoky meat . It had a distinctive flavor that can be achieved only with an exceedingly hot wok . <p> That same hot wok worked wonders with the vegetarian main course ( $ 16 ) that on our visit included snow peas , red peppers , squash and other crunchy additions . The jasmine rice served with this and other entrees had an exceptionally rich , nutty flavor . <p> SEDUCTIVE BRONZE GLAZE <p> One of the best dishes , however , was the master sauce chicken ( $ 17 ) with egg coins . The bird is poached in soy-ginger broth , giving it a seductive bronze glaze . A half egg , cut into three pieces , is coated in cornstarch and fried to add an intriguing element to the blend , which includes wheat pasta mixed with scallions and sesame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ )  --  a seafood broth with tiny dices of red bell pepper and carrots  --  had the heft of a minestrone , and the four shu mai dumplings in the middle had a marvelous flavor . They were topped with sweet Chinese mustard and filled with a coarse pork and shrimp mixture . <p> Barbecued shrimp ( $ 19 ) , a New Orleans classic , was excellent on its own , but it was served on pan-seared noodles , which acted as a sponge for the greasy sauce . The salad of greens and cabbage that took up a third of the plate quickly wilted into the brick-red pool . We decided that it was a great idea that did n't work . <p> The special sushi of the day ( $ 8.50 ) one evening did n't come together either . It started with a base of sushi rice stacked with marinated cucumbers , avocado , noodles , seared tuna and a warm fried crab and scallop cake . Disassembly was required before the dish could be eaten , and the flavors never melded . <p> TOO FEW DESSERTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dessert menu  --  Fennelly also did the San Francisco landscapes above the booths  --  but we were disappointed when we learned that only three of the six pictured were available . On other visits we were given only a few selections , verbally , and never got to taste what was supposed to be a house specialty , the chocolate moon pie ( $ 6 ) with ginger gelato , pralines and chocolate sauce . <p> Still , what we had was generally very good , including a dense chocolate pyramid ( $ 7 ) filled with chocolate raspberry mousse , and a pear cornmeal pound cake ( $ 6 ) with vanilla ice cream , raspberry coulis and lemon poppy  --  seed cookies . A trifle ( $ 6 ) with lemon curd , vanilla sponge cake and a mix of berries went a step too far : Adding lychee fruit gave it a tinned taste . Slices of banana bread pudding ( $ 6 ) had a great flavor but were dry ; the ice cream served alongside helped , but more brandy caramel sauce would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologetic that the entire selection was n't available . General manager Shaw McPherson , who came from New Orleans with Fennelly , displays a warmth that 's rare in many Bay Area restaurants . Every time we were there we saw him stop by every table to chat and to get suggestions about the food and service . His staff has that same caring attitude , so even if the food were n't so good , you 'd want to come back . <p> Though some dishes fall short , Fennelly 's creative cooking promises to get better . <p> *  --  <p> WINE LIST IS EASY TO DECIPHER <p> Although there are fewer than 30 wines on the list at Mike 's on Post , the selections cover a lot of ground . <p> Markups tend to be high , but the wines were chosen well to complement the East- West food . In addition , the wines are arranged from light to heavy , simple to complex , making it easier to figure out unfamiliar offerings . <p> Another plus is that almost half of the selections are available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with the 1995 J. Fritz Melon ( $ 22 ) or the 1995 Chateau Tahbilk Marsanne from Australia ( $ 22 ) . Fuller in body , the 1995 Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc from Santa Ynez Valley ( $ 30 ) has crisp flavors that go with most of the food . <p> The light-bodied 1995 Rex Hill Pinot Noir ( $ 21 ) is probably the most versatile of the reds , with the 1994 Einaudi Barbera Delle Langhe ( $ 29 ) a close second . <p> For all around good drinking , however , try the crisp , dry 1995 Druet Bourgeuil Rose ( $ 26 ) from the Loire . <p> Three of the four dessert wines are offered by the glass , too . One of the most interesting is the 1983 Tokaji Asuzu 6 Puttonyos from Hungary . A few years ago , you could buy it for less than $ 20 , but it has become so popular the retail price has more than doubled . Mike 's on Post offers it at $ 40 a bottle or $ 8 a glass . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POST ADDRESS : 639 Post St. ( between Taylor and Jones streets ) , San Francisco PHONE : ( 415 ) 771-6666 HOURS : Open for dinner 5:30-10 p.m .
