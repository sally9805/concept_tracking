<p> Forget Haymarket and Harlan County : The front line of today 's labor struggle is a hotel conference room in Cleveland . <p> These days , the descendants of union-busting operations such as the Pinkertons carry briefcases instead of truncheons , stride into CEOs ' offices instead of lurking near the gates with bats , and take advantage of weak labor laws and ineffective regulatory agencies to bust unions fight and left instead of having employers ask the governor to call out the National Guard . <p> When workers at Citarella Fine Foods , a gourmet meat and fish store on New York 's Upper West Side , started talking union , Citarella 's owner , Joe Gurrera , was n't pleased : He promptly fired three pro-union workers . After the United Food and Commercial Workers union organized months of community protest , the workers were reinstated , but Citarella is still nonunion . <p> The man behind the scenes counseling Gurrera was Alfred DeMaria , a partner at one of New York 's well-known labor law firms , Clifton , Budd &; DeMaria . DeMaria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , organizers say , was instrumental in keeping the store nonunion . Such aggressive anti-union campaigns are increasingly common as the labor movement pushes to organize workers , especially in the service sector . These anti-union strategists skirt the edges of legality , and DeMaria is just one example in a growing industry of professional union busters , experts in showing employers how to keep labor from organizing and still remain within the law , teaching them these tactics via a newsletter , pamphlets , a video series , and " continuing education " seminars such as the one Mother Jones sat in on this June . <p> At these seminars , lawyers and labor relations consultants from the nation 's top union-busting law firms come to speak to rapt , intimate groups of executives , advising them on how to beat union election drives , do end runs around the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) , and decertify unions , all the while hawking their own firms ' services . Union members are expressly banned . <p> Hoping to find out for ourselves the secrets of these modern-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio , titled Maintaining Nonunion Status . Led by DeMaria himself , the two-day event was organized by Executive Enterprises , one of the largest , best-known , and oldest management training seminar firms in the country . The New York City-based company-founded in the first wave of white-collar union busting during the 1970s  --  holds regular workshops on topics ranging from how to deal with environmental regulation to union avoidance . They are pricey ( about $500 a day ) , and designed to " deliver ... information to high-level executives . " <p> Surprisingly , the 20-odd executives gathered in the windowless conference room on the seventh floor of the Embassy Suites hotel are n't rabid anti-union ideologues . From vice presidents of midsized Rust Belt manufacturing companies to human resources managers at Southern food-processing plants , they 're not really " high-level executives , " either  --  more like midlevel managers who 've been looking forward to this all-expenses-paid company trip ... to Cleveland . In the frequent coffee breaks and over the abysmal hotel lunch , they chatter about what they 're going to do at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians game ?  --  and what shops they 'll visit before heading back to the airport on Wednesday . One vice president of an auto parts firm says his father has been a United Auto Workers union member for 30 years ( " I did n't tell him I was at this meeting , " he says sheepishly ) . Another participant used to be a lawyer for Local 1199 of the Hospital League , the health care workers union in New York City . Sometimes they even sound sympathetic to their workers ' desire to unionize : " Our people are in food service . They have no benefits and we pay them minimum wage . What do they have to lose ? " comments one attendee . <p> It is the seminar leader 's task to take the mild , straightforward attitude of these human resources managers  --  who are here because discouraging unions is basically part of their job  --  and transform it into one of visceral fear and loathing toward the unions . With his New York accent and matter-of-fact hostility toward labor organizers , DeMaria is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Citarella fits into a career of anti-union campaigns that spans the entire country and three decades . He is also the author of How Management Wins Union Organizing Campaigns and several other handbooks filled with union-busting tips , copies of sample anti-union fliers and leaflets , and texts of speeches shop-floor supervisors can make to discourage their workers from unionizing . On top of all that , DeMaria edits a monthly anti-union newsletter , Management Report . <p> Tellingly , the overriding metaphor DeMaria uses during the seminar is that of battle . The days of actual violence against union organizers may be waning , but DeMaria 's language is larded with imagery that recalls its heyday . " The earlier you know that the enemy is out there , the faster you can act to nip it in the bud ; he says . From the moment the campaign starts , he explains , union and management are in a state of war : " When the enemy is at the gate , you got to combat it . " <p> In DeMaria 's war zone scenario , even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening , a harbinger of skirmishes to come . <p> How to tell if a union is about to hit ? Well , there might be " small gatherings of employees , " ' " a great deal of busyness during breaks ; and , DeMaria warns , " the restroom becomes suddenly very popular .... You 'd think there was some kind of a kidney disease going around the plant . " <p> Just as DeMaria frightens the human resources managers with images of unions stirring up betrayal among loyal employees , he so instructs the managers to terrify the supervisors with visions of greedy , fat-cat , strike-happy , Mob-infested unions . <p> To illustrate the horror of union organizing , DeMaria screens the first video in a series made especially for supervisors . It 's a seething melodrama about an arrogant , lazy worker who becomes the union steward . The steward waves a pesky union contract all over the place , making it impossible for the supervisor to promote or fire his workers , demand overtime , or control his employees . " In a union shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell . " As the supervisor loses control of his workforce , his own job appears to be in peril . At the end of the video , in a plot twist that would n't pass muster on " Melrose Place , " the supervisor wakes up in a cold sweat . " I had a terrible dream ! " he tells his wife . " I dreamed that a union got into the plant . It was awful ! " <p> DeMaria 's methods may sound petty and preposterous , but they work . According to studies by Kate Bronfenbrenner , director of labor education research at Cornell 's School of Industrial and Labor Relations ( which DeMaria jokingly refers to as the " Cornell School of Communist Relations " ) , employers can cut union win rates in half by using such tactics as compulsory management-employee assemblies , anti-union leafleting , one-on-one meetings with supervisors , and firing pro-union employees . <p> Yet not all of DeMaria 's advice hinges on playing mean ; he tells his audience that the one surefire way to keep unions out is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to union organizers , and " a common refrain I get is , ' We do n't organize employees , management does . ' " DeMaria recommends offering competitive wages ( but not the highest wages around , he stresses , because you want discontented workers to leave ) and seniority and peer grievance review provisions . <p> Why would a bunch of employers go to a " union avoidance " seminar if they 're willing to raise wages ? It seems counterintuitive , but DeMaria knows his audience ; human resources managers are deeply flattered by this line of argument . The managers believe  --  or convince themselves  --  that no employee of theirs really wants a union . One woman confides to me that while it may seem as if employers are anti-union , what they really want is to be " enlightened " with their workers . From the manager 's point of view , workers do n't want unions , unions want workers . To make up for fainting membership  --  and declining dues  --  unions " target " companies , greedily trying to con hitherto loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the managers are told . <p> " I honestly want you to ask yourselves , Do you think those union organizers care one bit about you or your working conditions ? Of course not . They only pose as being interested in you in order to attract you into voting for them . Once they have done that , then they are in a perfect position to charge you and your co-employees , and that 's the way the union works , " reads a sample text for one supervisor 's pre-union-election speech in DeMaria 's handbook . <p> All of his recommendations about higher wages and benefits should be taken with a grain of salt , of course : Even the most enlightened managers have trouble arguing with the bottom line . But DeMaria 's willingness to make the suggestion shows that the reasons employers are frightened of unions go beyond immediate financial concerns , extending to fundamental questions about how production is organized and who controls the workplace . The mere presence of a union , the barest suggestion that management must cede some power over the shop to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paying bigger benefits seem like justifiable ( and relatively minor ) expenses . <p> The regulations of the NLRB are intended to check management 's rule of the workplace , but , as DeMaria shows , a determined and resourceful manager can sidestep these safeguards . Employers can bar union organizers from campaigning or leafleting in almost all areas of the workplace , and workers can be forbidden from talking union on the job . Meanwhile , employers can distribute innumerable leaflets and letters , and can talk about the union as much they want to , for as long as they want to , devoting hours of each day to mandatory group meetings and anti-union diatribes . As DeMaria puts it , running an anti-union campaign is " an exercise in property rights . " <p> Take DeMaria 's description of how to convince employees that if they vote the union out , they 'll get raises and better conditions  --  without actually saying so , which would be illegal : He says to tell them , " Our eyes have been opened . These are not concerns we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on us which prevent us from making any promises in a campaign , because that would be a bribe , and the board might force us to bargain with the union . We 're not in the business of bribing . But we hear you/ ' You can stay within the letter of the law , he advises , you just need to be creative : " A couple of changes of words here , elimination of a sentence or so , substitution of one word for another word  --  you would get the absolute same message across , as powerful as it was before , with no risk of an unfair labor practice lawsuit . " <p> By this point in the seminar , the executives at the Embassy Suites are disturbed by even minor restrictions . " Labor lawyers are so conservative ! " complains one woman . " Everything is so pro-union and anti-employer , " moans a man . <p> Still , the most effective weapon employers always have is the power to fire workers . Technically , it is illegal to fire a worker for union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law , saying that campaigns can easily be won without ever resorting to illegal tactics . " Disabuse yourself of the information that in order to win you got to get nasty and illegal . You can get nasty all you want , you just do n't have to get illegal/ ' But , like most union busters , he implicitly suggests that firing workers can be very helpful early in a campaign . <p> " Let 's suppose during this early period of card signing you discharge a prime mover , and the NLRB finds that you did it on a discriminatory basis . What are the remedies ? Reinstatement , back pay ... and you got ta post a notice saying , We 've been bad boys and girls , we wo n't do it again , " says DeMaria . By the time an employer 's appeals are over , the worker will probably have a new job , so reinstatement wo n't be a real issue , and the back pay requirement will have been offset by the wages the employee earned in the meantime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , as DeMaria puts it , " Some companies will just say , ' Hey , where 's the cheek ? ' " <p> Workers who believe in unions because they think they offer the best chance for dignity and democracy in the workplace implicitly deny management 's prerogative for total control . DeMaria knows this . The greatest threat to management , the employees who 'll be the most difficult to dissuade in an election campaign , he says , are the ones who want to join a union because they " feel a sense of belonging . " In an issue of Management Report , DeMaria describes " careful hiring " practices at one firm , which conducts two-hour interviews with job candidates and their spouses , paying special attention to how the couple reacts when told that the company " does n't believe unions are necessary . " Presumably , those candidates who seem taken aback do n't get hired . But if , somehow , employees with this desire for a " sense of belonging " creep into the workforce , DeMaria has this advice : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to make them perceive that if they carry out on their sense of belonging and join the union , consequences to them will be so dire they will be better off subverting their sense of belonging and voting no . " <p> This is the real logic behind a union-busting campaign , whether at a hospital , office , or factory . By demonstrating management 's power in the workplace , the company appeals to two opposing psychological poles in its employees : loyalty and fear . You can " make an appeal to the employees ' loyalty to the company : ' We 're the company , and we want you to be loyal to us because we 're good . ' That 's the loyalty approach ; DeMaria explains . " The other approach is through fear : ' If you join the union , you may not get what you want ; there may be a strike ; you may be permanently replaced ; we may , with the appropriate underpinnings , close the plant . ' " <p> DeMaria adds , " The majority of campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of belonging , you ca n't overcome that by saying , ' I 'm wonderful , vote for me . ' The way you overcome the sense of belonging is you make a bomb , and you throw it in .
