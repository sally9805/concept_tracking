Moore : Twelve-year-olds working in Indonesian factories ? That 's O.K. with you ? <P> Knight : They 're not 12-year-olds working in factories ... The minimum age is 14 . <P> Moore : How about 14 , then ? Does n't that bother you ? <P> Knight : No . <P>  --  Nike CEO Phil Knight talking to director Michael Moore in a scene from The Big One <P> What was Phil Knight thinking when he agreed to appear in Michael Moore 's just released movie ? If he actually trusted the populist filmmaker to intervene as Knight went postal on camera and started pumping round after round into his own foot , then Nike 's founder is even more out of touch than legend has it . Who volunteers for an ambush interview and then , to compound his error , publicly condemns the outcome ? <P> Moore , skilled at paying out rope to his victims ( and then charging them for it ) , later agreed to meet with Nike spokesman Lee Weinstein to discuss damage control . Nike had two problems with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to include Knight 's endorsement of a 14-year-old labor force while leaving out his subsequent pledge to make a transition to 16-year-olds ( a difficult task , says Nike , given the workers ' propensity for using " forged documents " ) . Second , Knight referred to his employees as " poor little Indonesian workers , " a characterization that failed to convey the respect in which he held them . In both instances , Weinstein insisted , Phil had " misspoken . " What would it take to make these two classic moments go away ? <P> Moore decided to deal . He could n't remove anything from the movie , he told Weinstein , but if Nike were to build a facility in Flint , Mich. , he 'd add a new scene . Heartened , Weinstein whipped out a notepad . Would that be a shoe factory or a warehouse ? Moore , who ca n't keep a straight face at gunpoint , fought back tears of incredulity . Anything that 'll employ 500 people at a livable wage , he replied . Weinstein promised to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . But like the rest of America , he ca n't seem to get through a day without experiencing some sort of Nike moment . Recently he was sitting in a waiting room in Hollywood when he was greeted by a studio president toting two large Nike shopping bags . Curious , Moore asked why the executive was shopping for athletic gear in the middle of his workday . Simple , the mogul replied , you ca n't beat the price . <P> Especially when there is n't one . As it turned out , Moore 's friend had just returned from a special Nike outlet in Marina del Rey . Unlike your average NikeTown , this facility gives admission by pass only . And you ca n't get a pass unless you 're tight with an affable young promotions manager named Tracy Hardy-Gray , known industrywide as " Tracy the Nike Lady . "
