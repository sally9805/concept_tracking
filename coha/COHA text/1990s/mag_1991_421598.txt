Saving for the future <p> A movement is sweeping the country . Its genesis : the exploding financial , political , and environmental costs of energy . Folks have discovered what they call a hidden " source " of energy , one that is clean , safe , and cheap . It 's called efficiency , and it 's the best strategy we have for curing our addiction to fossil fuels . Indeed , energy efficiency experts contend we can reduce the nation 's need for oil and other fuels as much as 44 percent by the year 2000 . <p> Americans have taken to the task of sustaining the environment  --  recycling waste , cleaning up the coastlines , and eschewing disposable goods . Now it 's time to focus on energy . The bonus : Energy efficiency saves not only the planet but also money . <p> In the Seventies , conservation meant donning flannel shirts , lowering thermostats , and waiting in lines for gas . The imperative then was oil embargoes . Now conservation corresponds to the newfound commitment to preserving the environment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our acts . <p> This guide offers only a starting point for reducing energy consumption . For those who want to do more , we also provide a resource list . HOME REMEDIES <p> The conservation-wise house need not resemble the Jetsons ' home . In fact , it will probably look more like the Cleaver household . The most important changes in residential energy efficiency , experts say , will be societal rather than technological , although technological advances increasingly pay heed to energy usage . <p> While energy-efficient appliances sometimes carry higher price tags , in the long run they prove significantly less expensive than many models that may initially cost less . Before you buy , calculate what the energy savings will be in a year and then multiply it by the lifetime of that appliance . Compare that cost with the lifetime price of the less efficient model and you 'll see the long-term savings . CHEAP FREEZE <p> Monitor the refrigerator 's temperature settings . The fridge should hover between 38 degrees and 42 degrees F , the freezer between 0 degrees and 5 degrees F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dollar bill in the door as you close it . If it clips out easily , it 's time to tighten the door gaskets . Condenser coils also require periodic checking for cleanliness : To operate efficiently , the coils need air circulating around them . Because freezers work best when filled with food , you can " fool " the freezer into using less energy : Fill milk cartons with water at least halfway and place them in the freezer . When it 's time to dump your old icebox , recycle the chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) refrigerants . ( CFCs , contained in almost all fridges , contribute to ozone depletion . ) COOKING LIGHT <p> Methods for saving energy while cooking require little more than common sense . The microwave , which uses about 50 percent less energy than conventional ovens , substitutes for an oven if you need to heat or cook only a small amount . When you do use your oven , maximize its heating capacity . Defrost frozen food in the refrigerator before cooking it . Preheat your oven no longer than ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just be wasted . Similarly , you can turn your oven off ten minutes before your dish is done ; the food will continue cooking as the oven slowly cools off . Avoid opening the door while cooking . Each time you do , you can lose more than 50 degrees of heat . Use the right-size pan for cooking ; larger than necessary pans require excess energy . And when cooking on the range , place lids on pots to keep the heat inside . Cooking pasta in a topless pan , for example , requires three times as much energy as cooking it in a covered pot . Materials can also make a difference . Substitute glass or ceramic dishes for other materials , since they bake your food at a temperature about 25 degrees lower than the one stipulated in the recipe . Copper-bottom pans are best : They heat faster ; food cooks faster , using less energy . COLD FEET , WARM BED <p> Americans own more than 20 million water beds , most sporting a built-in heating unit . During the winter , one water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be ready yet to give it up for a futon , but you can reduce its energy use . If you opt to run the heater , keep the bed made and place an insulating pad between the water bag and the sheets . This will keep heat from escaping during the day . LITE LIGHT <p> Of all the products that help you save energy effortlessly , light bulbs are the cheapest and easiest to install . Compact fluorescents cast light that 's indistinguishable from that of incandescent bulbs , but can save you more than $30 on your electricity bill . They cost more than ordinary incandescent bulbs  --  between $10 and $22  --  but save over the long run . An 18-watt compact fluorescent bulb emits as much light as a 75-watt incandescent bulb and lasts ten times as long . Maximize the energy of incandescent bulbs by cleaning the fixtures at least four times a year . Calculate energy costs when you consider wattage . Using one 100-watt bulb will cost 70 percent less than using two 60-watt bulbs . Paint or paper walls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light that hits them , while black walls reflect only 10 percent . Install occupancy sensors . If you forget to turn off the lights , the sensor does it . SOME LIKE IT HOT <p> The water heater consumes more electricity than any other appliance in the typical household , nearly twice as much as the refrigerator , the second greatest electricity user . Maximize the performance of your water heater by buying an insulating blanket for about $10 . Monitor the heater 's temperature and be careful not to raise it to more than about 130 degrees F. If you use gas heat , consider a gas water heater . Over its lifetime , a gas hot water heater will cost about $3,240 , while an electric will take $8,040 . Monitor your hot water usage . Stop leaks , particularly hot water drips , as soon as you notice them . Use low-flow faucet aerators , available at most hardware stores , on shower and sink faucet heads to reduce hot water consumption by as much as 50 percent . Low-flow aerators can save between $50 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install low-flow aerators , completely open the top of a milk carton and place it under the shower running full blast . If the carton fills in less than ten seconds , you should consider purchasing an aerator . ) Washing machines and dishwashers can also waste water . Run only full loads , never one or two garments or dishes at a time . Use cold water in the rinse cycle . As much as 90 percent of the energy consumed in the average washing cycle goes toward heating the water . In summer , if it 's practical , use a clothesline instead of a dryer . Washing dishes by hand saves about half the hot water a dishwasher requires . If you use a dishwasher , save energy by setting the appliance on a cool dry .

Energy-wise products . THIS COLD HOUSE <p> Programmable thermostats best ensure proper heat levels , allowing maximum heat when you want it ( early morning and late evening ) and minimal heat ( during the day and while you 're sleeping ) . But before you take this ambitious step , try these measures : Weatherproof and caulk your home to prevent heat leaks . Weather-stripping windows and doors can save as much as 20 percent on your heating bills . A major unexpected heat leak : the fireplace . To fix it , insert an inexpensive plastic strip around the damper . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Energy , the heat retention value of your attic ( known as the R value ) should be at least 30 . To meet the standard , lay down about 9 inches of fiber batting or 10 to 14 inches of blown insulation , both available at the hardware store . Another 20 percent of heat leakage occurs through basement walls and 1 percent through the basement floor . Insulate well under floors . Place foam insulating pads ( about $2 for ten pads ) behind electrical outlets to minimize heat loss . Leave some rock storage space underneath the slabs if you 're building . Basement walls can absorb solar heat during the day and release it into rooms after the sun goes down . NO PANE , NO GAIN <p> The main culprits of heat loss in the winter and heat gain in the summer , windows are essential weapons in the war against energy abuse . During the winter , faulty windows can produce nearly 25 percent of a house 's heat loss . Heavy drapes help . In the summer , keep the drapes drawn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install storm windows and doors . Better yet , buy windows made of low-emissivity , or low-E , glass . Low-E glass is coated to reduce the amount of heat lost to the outside world by at least 50 percent . It also reflects outside heat , reducing heat gain in the summer . As effective as the low-E window is , superwindows are twice as beneficial . These windows basically comprise two low-E panes with either a vacuum or a transparent , nonconducting material such as argon between them . Although they can cost about 50 percent more than normal windows , they pay for themselves in energy savings in about three years . They also provide greater thermal insulation , resist condensation , and block ultraviolet rays . THE BIG CHILL <p> Cooling can consume as much energy as heating . Air conditioning is the most costly way to cool a home , especially when you factor in the environmental costs of HCFCs . If you use an air conditioner , place it in the shade on the north side of the house . In the sun , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shade . Shade trees block the influx of sun , reducing air conditioning by as much as 50 percent . Use ceiling fans to cool and heat . Placed in an attic or on the upper floor , ceiling fans sweep hot air off the lower floors . In winter , running in reverse , they push the warm air down . NINE TO FIVE <p> You may not have control over your company 's policies or equipment , but you can still save watts in the workplace . For starters , turn off lights and computers in your office when you step out for more than a few moments . You can also urge your employer to adopt these measures : Buy copiers with energy-saver controls that keep the machines from running at full power when they 're not in use . Turn off the copiers during standard off-peak hours , such as early in the morning , at lunch , and overnight , to save even more energy . Laser printers require about ten times as much energy as less expensive office printers . Use lasers for presentations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : fax machines with thermal printers . Although they tend to be the least expensive models , they require the most energy . Laptops are more energy efficient than desktop computers and they also allow workers to take work home with them . If desktop computers are the norm , however , opt for small screens . Switch to recycled paper , which requires up to 64 percent less energy to produce than virgin paper . Institute recycling . Recycling paper reduces air pollution by 74 percent and water pollution by 35 percent . Promote telecommuting . Establish car pools for employees . Turn boardrooms into locker rooms for employees who bike or hike to work . RESOURCES " Greenpeace Catalog , " Box 77048 , San Francisco , CA 94107 ; ( 800 ) 456-4092 .

Some energy experts advocate a series of measures designed to regulate the efficiency of all buildings slated for construction . Owners of homes garnering particularly efficient ratings would be eligible for lower-interest mortgages or loans . Similarly , they could get larger mortgages . Indeed , a number of mortgage houses have begun to factor energy efficiency into their loan systems . There 's also a movement to incorporate efficient technology into low-income housing .

ROAD TIPS <p> Each year Americans chalk up 27 billion miles on the road . While it 's unlikely that everyone will give up his wheels , drivers can take more responsibility for lowering the nation 's fuel bill . More than 20 percent of the average American 's income is spent on transportation , so saving petroleum also saves money . The average American vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The obvious solution : car pools . In some cities , carrying more than one passenger entitles you to less crowded roadways . Buy energy-efficient cars . Look for models that give good gas mileage . Keep your car properly tuned and tires inflated . Maintaining the proper tire pressure can save 20 to 30 percent of gasoline use . When buying new tires , look at high-performance models : They can make a difference . ( And check into recycling your old tires . ) Before going on a long trip , wash the car to reduce wind resistance . Idling wastes gas and creates air pollution ; turn the motor off when you 're at a standstill . Keep your windows closed on the highway ; energy experts contend it is actually better to run the air conditioner than to allow an open window to increase aerodynamic drag . Never speed . Fuel efficiency can decrease 25 percent if you drive 65 miles per hour instead of 55 . Forty-five mph remains the most energy-efficient driving speed , due to your car 's air resistance at higher speeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance . Some luxury model cars include meters that give instantaneous readings on energy efficiency . Encourage your local and congressional representatives to provide energy-saving incentives . California leads the way in innovative solutions : In 1995 Californians will buy 10,000 hybrid automobiles  --  electric cars with an engine that recharges its own battery . By 2003 , 10 percent of all vehicles sold in California will have to be electric . On weekend errands , batch trips . Try to take public transportation or walk . Take the train instead of the plane : It 's more romantic anyway .
