THE HEAT WAS KILLING HIM . <p> There was the chatter of monkeys , buzz of flies ; a long sharp caw . Water flowed somewhere nearby , falling over stones . <p> Mason stumbled out of the trees and into a clearing . A cloud of blue and white butterflies rose from the moss at his feet , fluttering about his face , momentarily blinding him . When the butterflies cleared away , he saw a hut on the other side of the clearing . Mason was certain the hut had n't been there a moment ago . <p> He crossed the clearing , squinting against the glare and the heat of the sun . Dead vines hung from the roof of the hut , trailed across the open doorway and the single window . Mason climbed the two steps and pushed through the vines . The hut was empty , and even hotter than outside . <p> Mason came back out of the hut . It was late afternoon , he was exhausted and thirsty , and he wondered if he should search for the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time he reached it , or it would turn out to be something completely useless that just sounded like flowing water . Mason shook his head , deciding no . He was too tired for that . <p> He moved around the hut to the side shaded from the sun and lay on the soft carpet of thick , green moss , his back against the hut wall . The noise around him steadily increased - birds shrieked , animals snorted , insects cracked and whirred . Something like the beat of drums vibrated up to him through the moss . Mason closed his eyes and slept . <p> He did not know where he was , and only barely knew who he was . If he was still on Earth , it was a part of Earth unlike any he had ever known or heard of- a place where , it seemed , physical laws were regularly defied . He knew his name , but almost nothing else about himself . His past was gone . <p> He did not know how to get it back . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back and gazed up at the sky above him . A thick , orange haze obscured all signs of the sun ; or perhaps the sun was not yet high enough to be seen . The heat was already stifling . The sound of flowing water was louder now , and his thirst had become painful . <p> He heard the crackling static of a radio . He glanced up at the roof , saw a long thin antenna projecting from the peak . Now this is interesting , he thought . He struggled to his feet and walked into the hut . <p> A large radio set rested on a wooden table next to the window . The static emerged from a set of headphones lying beside the radio . A single chair stood in front of the table . <p> Mason sat at the table and studied the radio . The controls were simple , though unmarked - ancient round analog knobs and dials . He found the volume , turned it down , put the headset over his ears , then slowly brought the volume back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tuning dial and turned it . <p> Music faded in , faint , then faded out immediately . Mason fiddled with the dial , trying to bring in the station . He caught it for a few moments -a Latin beat , guitars and mandolins and percussion , a hint of a voice singing in Spanish . Something vaguely familiar about it , for a moment he almost thought he understood the Spanish words . Something about flowers ? Then it dissolved into a squealing burst of static . Mason tried to tune it back in , but could n't find it again . He continued up the frequencies . <p> He found nothing else except a few tiny gaps of real silence amidst the static . He switched bands , though he had no idea which bands he was switching to or from . <p> A voice . Crackle of static , then another voice . He feathered the dial , turned up the volume . He was picking up a conversation , two people radioing to each other . Then it came through loud and clear . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . We 're in the middle of a goddamn swamp . Hold on a minute . " Static . " Dingo says we 're in Foxtrot Abel , four-oh-three dash three niner . " <p> " Fine , just fine , Torelli . You 're headed right for him . " A flutter went through Mason 's stomach , rose to push against his heart . He knew , somehow , that they were trying to find him . Whoever they were . <p> " Roger that and out , Sorcerer . " <p> The static returned . Mason took a stone and scratched a mark on the frequency display . He would have to keep track of their progress . And when they closed in on him , then what ? <p> He had no idea . <p> Dark , heavy clouds roiled in overhead , almost instantly blotting out the sun and bringing darkness to the hut , and within seconds a drenching downpour crashed down . Mason scrambled to his feet . <p> Rain . Water . How could he catch it ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head tilted back and mouth open like a baby bird ? He looked around the hut , and there on the table , beside the radio , was a large , open gourd . He picked it up and discovered it was already full . Of course . He brought the gourd to his mouth and drank the cold , clean water . When he could drink no more , the gourd was still full . Of course again . And when the rain eventually stopped , the gourd would probably be empty . <p> Feeling bloated , Mason set the gourd on the table , then sat in the chair in front of the radio . He looked at the headset ; nothing but a steady hiss emerged from it . Overhead , the rain was a pounding clutter on the metal roof panels , drowning out all sounds of the jungle . <p> Dusk fell , then night , and the rain did not let up . Mason remained in the chair , dozing , the clattering rain and radio hiss a soothing background now . Fragmented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A break in the radio 's hiss brought him awake . Mason grabbed for the headset and put it over his ears . <p> " ... ing Sorcerer . " <p> " Torelli , this is Sorcerer . Status report . " <p> " Status is all screwed up , you want the truth . We 're still in the goddamn swamp and now we 're being hit by a monsoon . And this afternoon we lost Polk . " <p> " Lost him ? " <p> " Yeah . Stepped into some kind of hole , went down , never came up . We 're down to five now . " <p> " But you 're making progress , yes ? " <p> " Yeah , Dingo says . She 's got us on a straight-line to the target . But at this rate it 'll take us weeks to get to him . " <p> " Do n't worry , Torelli . The swamp ends soon , and the weather will improve . " <p> " Yeah ? " <p> " Yes . I guarantee it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hope you 're right , Sorcerer . " <p> " I 'm right , Torelli . Count on it . " <p> " Okay . Roger and out , Sorcerer . " <p> " And out , Torelli . " <p> The static returned . Mason removed the headset , set it beside the radio . He got up from the chair and walked to the open doorway . A faint phosphorescence seemed to illuminate the jungle around him , limning the downpour , outlining the trees . Mason stood there a long time , watching . <p> In the morning the rain stopped , the sky cleared , and water steamed up from the jungle floor . Mason watched the steam rise , then walked out into it , like moving through hot , insubstantial clouds . Out in the trees , he searched for fruit to eat , and picked several different types before returning to the hut . <p> He tried them all , though none of them tasted particularly good . A few minutes after he 'd finished eating , his stomach began to cramp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he guessed , would come later . Mason stared at the radio for some time , listening to the static coming from the headset , then turned and walked out of the hut . <p> He would not stay here and wait for them . He would strike out into the jungle and keep going-either toward those closing in on him , or away from them . It did n't matter . He would escape , or force the issue . Either was preferable to waiting . <p> Mason gazed up at the rising sun glowing a deep hot orange above the treetops . East , he decided . He glanced back at the hut for a moment , then pushed into the jungle . <p> Progress was slow , the undergrowth dense between the huge trunks of the primary trees . He lost sight of the sun almost immediately , but caught occasional glimpses of it through fleeting breaks in the canopy high above him . Water dripped steadily from the thick leaves and branches , keeping him hot and wet . <p> He heard animal sounds of all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkeys , snuffling and crashing of larger creatures moving through the undergrowth around him , the high-pitched roaring of big cats - but it was n't long before he realized he never actually saw any of the animals . Mason searched the shifting light and shadow of the trees and ferns and creepers all around him , tried focusing on the sounds , the cries and calls , but never saw the bird or monkey or whatever creature called out . Once he saw a huge beetle , shiny metallic blue and green , antennae shivering ; it worked its way across a fallen tree , clicking as it moved . But there was nothing else . <p> Several hours later , Mason emerged from the trees and into an empty clearing . A cloud of blue and white butterflies rose from the ground and surrounded his head , momentarily blinding him . When the butterflies cleared , he saw the hut on the other side of the clearing , long antenna dipping slightly in a breeze he could not feel . <p> After waiting several hours without success for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mason gave up and tried to find the radio station playing cantina music . He sat at the table with the headset on and the volume up , switching bands and gently moving through the frequencies . Once , he was able to tune in to something that sounded like the crashing of metal against metal with a heavy thrumming background , but he could n't tell if it was the sound of machinery , or some harsh industrial music . Whatever it was , it sounded familiar , and he almost thought he could place it , but then the station began flickering in and out , and finally disappeared altogether . <p> Eventually , though , Mason found the other station , or something very much like it . Latin music , definitely . Congas , mandolin , acoustic guitar , maybe a marimba ? The station threatened to fade away , he adjusted the tuner , bringing it back ; it faded again , he adjusted ; fade , adjust , fade , adjust , concentrating intently on it as it fluttered in and out , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . And then he finally locked in , solid , the signal coming through clear and sharp . Cranked up the volume . A woman singing in Spanish , a song about love and guns and the hot sun beating down on the world . <p> Suddenly Mason was in a cantina ; in Mexico , he thought , on the coast , a hot night , the light of glassed candles at the tables . He stood in a narrow corridor , by a cigarette machine , empty beer bottles on top of the machine . The music came from small speakers nailed to the dark ceiling beams . The aroma of frying fish filled the room . A heavyset man stood behind the bar , sweating and gazing out across the cantina , and an older woman in red and black served drinks to the few customers - an old man in the corner drinking tequila ; a young couple by the window with margaritas ; and a stocky middle-aged man just two tables from Mason , leaning back against the wall and drinking from a dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stared at him , his expression hard and tight . <p> Mason had been here before , he knew that , and he had seen that man now staring at him . And he knew , somehow , that the man had been waiting for him to show up . The man leaned forward and started to stand , and Mason knew the man was going to come after him . <p> But the man never got the chance . The cantina floor heaved and shook , like a huge whipping earthquake . Mason was thrown against the cigarette machine , he reached out to catch his balance , grabbed a beer bottle ; the ground shook again and he fell , the bottle breaking in his hands and his head cracking against the cantina wall . Silver and red crisscrossed his vision and he reached out for support , pulled himself up . <p> When his vision cleared , he found himself on the floor of the hut , gripping the table with one hand , a piece of broken beer bottle in his bleeding other hand . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mason pulled himself back up onto the chair , his heart beating hard against his ribs . He set the broken glass on the table , then put the headset on again . The signal was gone . He turned the tuning dial back and forth , but could not pull it back in . Mason smiled to himself , staring at the piece of brown , broken glass . He knew he would find the station again . Or something even better . And next time he would be prepared . <p> MORNING CAME HARD and bright and hot . Mason stumbled from the hut , blinking against the glare of the sun slicing in at him across the treetops . He was woozy-partly from the heat , partly from hunger , but mostly from thirst . The gourd had been empty since the rainstorm had ended , and he 'd found no other source of water . <p> He stood in the clearing , gazing into the trees and fighting the dizziness , when a chunk of memory fell on him from out of the sun : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair covering most of her face , one foot bare . Then more of the memory surfaced : His own hands gently pullingback the hair to see open , lifeless eyes and a small strange puncture in the woman 's temple . The woman . Alexandra . <p> Mason staggered back to the hut , sat on the steps and leaned against the door frame , rustling the dead vines . Alexandra . The pain clawed his gut and tore at his chest , a creature trying to rip its way out of his body . The pain was terrible , and what made it even worse , and frightening , was that he had no idea who she was . He knew her name , he knew that he had loved her , and he knew she was dead , but he knew nothing else . Who was she , really ? How had he come to know her ? How long had he known her ? Were they lovers ? Married ? He just did not know . All he knew was the grief and pain the knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply , easing away the pain until it was little more than a dull ache . Then he stood , weaving slightly for a few moments . Almost numb , Mason stepped away from the hut and headed into the jungle . <p> He crashed through thick undergrowth , keeping hands and arms up to protect his face . He did n't know where he was going , and he did n't care . He 'd had it with all this - his past gone , then coming back to him in pieces , almost worse than having no memory at all . And now this , his memory of Alexandra-incomplete , not even close to being whole , more pain than anything else . He just wanted it to end . <p> He stumbled over a fallen branch , caught himself , then tripped again , over a jutting rock , and fell forward , his face almost plunging into a clear stream bubbling along over moss-covered stones . <p> Mason pushed up to his hands and knees and stared at the water . Another goddamn illusion , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body parched . He reached out with one hand , and lowered it into the stream <p> Water . Cold and wet , real water . Mason crouched forward , filled cupped hands with the cold , clear water , and drank . <p> He drank again and again , he splashed water onto his face , over his head , and drank again . If the stream had been big enough he would have taken off all his clothes and gone in , but it was n't deep or wide enough to even lie in . So he drank and poured water over himself until all his clothes were wet and he was completely bloated . <p> Mason lay on his back beside the stream and gazed up into the thick canopy of leaves and branches above him . He listened to the burbling sounds of the water , and the steady background of noises from animals he was n't even sure existed . Closing his eyes , he soaked in the heat drying his clothes , and let all feeling leak out of him . <p> Mason woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , barely able to see the reflections of the water flowing past him . The air was quiet and still , almost suffocating . He crawled forward and drank again . <p> He still remembered no more of Alexandra , the woman he was sure he loved , the woman he had found , dead , curled up in a rattan chair . The grief was a strange , numb ache echoing through him . <p> Mason stood , listening to the hot night . Things were coming to a head , he decided . This entire mess , whatever it was , would resolve here , one way or another . The people tracking him would find the hut and the clearing , they would find him , and he would somehow escape them , or he would die . <p> If he wanted any real chance to escape , he needed to know more than he did . He needed his memories ; he needed his past . <p> He turned away from the stream and pushed through the jungle . He could not see where he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he was sure it did n't matter . No matter what direction he followed , he would eventually come out in the clearing , he was certain of that . <p> Fifteen or twenty minutes later , he did . There were no butterflies , but the hut was there , roof panels shimmering in the moonlight . <p> Mason stopped halfway across the clearing and stared at the reflected moonlight . Another memory twisted up inside him , jammed into place . <p> A recent memory . He crouched in shadow on a rooftop , full moon lighting half of the alley below him . He was silent and still , watching and listening . Scraping sounds came from the darkened part of the alley , and Mason saw a huge , vague shadow against shadow moving toward the light , and he was suddenly afraid , very afraid ... <p> The memory ended . He knew there was more to it but it remained lost to him . Mason shook himself . He needed the radio . <p> He hurried into the hut , sat at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the band and frequency being used by the squad tracking in on him . Cranked up the volume . <p> " ... goddamn , Sorcerer , where are you ? Sorcerer , this is Torelli , come in ! " <p> " Torelli , this is Sorcerer . " <p> " Where the hell have you been ? We 've been trying to get through to you for over an hour . " <p> " A technical problem , Torelli . It does n't concern you . Now , what 's your status ? " <p> " We 're dug in for the night . Just too dark to go on , especially with no moon ... " <p> ( No moon ? Mason wondered how that could be ? Was he wrong about these people ? No , he knew he was n't . ) <p> " ... Dingo figures six , seven hours to contact . We should have him by mid-afternoon tomorrow . If he 's still there . " <p> " He 's still there , Torelli . You can count on it . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell of a mission . " <p> " It 's your job , Torelli . " <p> There was a long , crackling pause . " Yeah , I guess . " Another pause , shorter , then , " We 'll be in touch tomorrow morning when we move out . " <p> " No , Torelli , make that a negative . I do n't want to hear from you until the target has been terminated . " <p> Another long pause . Mason felt sick at the word . <p> " All right , Sorcerer . This is your show . Roger that and out . " <p> And the crackling static returned . <p> Mason sat without moving , listening . Tomorrow . One way or another , it would be over tomorrow . <p> But there was still time before they arrived . Mason switched bands and began slowly sliding through the frequencies . Almost immediately , something , a dip in the static . Then it was gone . He went back , adjusted carefully , but could n't find it . Further on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't make out a single word . Then it , too , was gone . <p> Sweat collected under the headphones , dripped from his hair , his eyebrows , stinging his eyes . Mason stared at the dials , the lights , as if they would somehow tell him what he should do , where on the bands he should go . His fingers trembled with the strain . <p> There . Something . A faint banging , metal on pipes . It faded , but he feathered the tuner , pulling it back in . Jumped up the volume , tapped , tapped at the dial ... and there ! He had it . <p> A deep , heavy thrumming vibrated the headphones , the bones of his skull . Mason closed his eyes , trying to imagine himself in the middle of the thrumming . Then a steady clanging of metal against metal came in , pipe against pipe , something like that . And through it all , just at the edge of his hearing , an oscillating hiss , fading in and out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And then Mason was there . <p> He stood in a vast , dimly lit chamber , surrounded by enormous machines that cast huge shadows . The ceiling was high , nearly invisible - maybe forty or fifty feet above him . Water dripped steadily , invisible but somewhere nearby , the dripping sounds echoing from the walls and floors and ceiling of stone and metal . A string of chains hung from the nearest machine , silent and unmoving , breaking up silvery blue light coming from a recess in the stone wall behind it . <p> His breath was a dissipating fog , and he shivered from the cold . The deep thrumming continued , and he felt the slight vibrations of it through his shoes . The clanking and banging of pipes had ceased when he had first appeared , but now it started up again , though distant and muted . Lights flickered on a squat , bulky machine across the chamber , and a highpitched whine erupted from it . Then the whine and lights faded , and the machine became still again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - he knew this place . Something fluttered in the air above him , a flapping shadow . A bat , he thought . But when the thing dove toward him , and he ducked away from it , he was almost overcome by a wash of heat in its wake , and the stink of rotting flesh . It climbed into the darkness and disappeared . <p> Mason stepped around the machine with the hanging chains and moved slowly forward , his legs weak , so weak , searching the shadows , the narrow shafts of light . He was almost certain he was n't alone ; he felt he was being watched , perhaps studied . <p> Mason knew , suddenly , that this was the last place he 'd been before waking up in the jungle . This was the last place he 'd had his own memories , the last place he 'd had his life . But he still could not remember what had happened to him here . <p> The bat-thing came at him again , diving from the darkness above . Mason dropped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bat-thing slashed by , made contact with his arm , and Mason almost cried out with the burning pain . The bat-thing fluttered off , awkward and slow now , and Mason looked at his arm in the dim blue light . Across his forearm was a narrow , red streak of blistered skin , maybe four or five inches long . No blood , but plenty of pain . <p> He returned to the machine with the hanging chains , managed to unhook one of them , a section of thick metal links about six feet long and heavy . Mason doubled the chain , hooked it together , then backed away with one end gripped in his right hand , the metal clinking faintly as he moved . He might be signaling his location , but at least he was n't defenseless . <p> He worked his way through the machines , in and out of shadows , slashes and pools of blue-white light . The light came from screened pale lamps recessed in the stone walls at apparently random locations and heights . Another machine came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banging , only to quit after little more than a minute . Mason kept on . <p> The chamber widened , then angled off to the side . Mason came around the corner , saw a metal stairway bolted to the wall and leading up to a narrow catwalk which fronted two metal doors set in the stone wall . This was what he wanted , what he had been looking for the first time he had come here . But why ? What had he been searching for , exactly ? <p> He hesitated at the bottom of the stairs , searching the shadows around him , the air above . He spotted the water , dripping out of a pipe that emerged from the wall high above the floor and then falling into a metal cistern . But there were no other signs of movement , and the bat-thing seemed to have disappeared for good . Mason grabbed the metal railing with his free hand and started up the stairway . <p> The stairway shook with each step , and he wondered if the whole thing-stairway and catwalk both- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the floor below , taking him with it . But he 'd come too far to turn back now . <p> When he reached the top of the stairs , he paused again before moving along the catwalk . The first door was about ten feet along the catwalk , the second maybe twenty feet further on . Mason walked slowly forward , trying to remain silent , though he could n't manage it . His footsteps were quiet , but the catwalk clanked and groaned with every movement . <p> He stopped in front of the first door , the catwalk swaying slightly beneath him , and adjusted his grip on the chain . Then he grabbed the door knob , turned it , and pulled . <p> The door swung easily and silently open . Behind the door was a large room lit by strips of blue phosphor laid across the ceiling . Inside the room were half a dozen antique filing cabinets , rotting cardboard boxes , wooden crates , a couple of metal desks and secretarial chairs , and two ancient , dark green metal footlockers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And sitting on one of the footlockers , looking directly at him , was a woman wearing shock armor and holding a disruptor aimed at his chest . <p> Mason knew her . Or at least he had , when he 'd had all his memories . He had known her here in this place , in this room . " We figured you 'd be back , " the woman said . It was , he realized , the voice of Sorcerer . " We were closing in on you , but we thought , if we lost you , you 'd be back here someday . And we 'd be waiting . I 'm surprised , though , to see you back here so soon . " She glanced around the room , at the open cabinets , the crates that had been tom apart . " What is it you 're looking for ? " the woman asked . " What is it that 's so important ? " <p> Mason did n't answer . He could n't have even if he 'd wanted to . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'd hoped the memory loss would have lasted longer , " the woman said , shrugging . She looked at the chain in Mason 's hand and grinned . " But you still must be suffering from concussion if you come back here armed only with that . " She shook her head . " I have to credit you , though , Mason . You managed to blind jump away from us , with no memory and with a neural distorter patched into you . None of us would have thought that possible . " She gave a brief nod . " You wo n't pull that off again . " <p> He should know what she was talking about . It was vaguely familiar , and it sounded right , but he did n't understand a damn thing she was saying . <p> " Not too smart , coming back here like this . You ca n't jump again for days , except to boomerang , and we 're closing in on you there . We 've got you , my friend . We 've got you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure wrong about some things . With hardly a thought , he stepped forward and swung the chain at the woman . She was caught by surprise , but still managed to get her arm up in time , save her head . The chain crashed against the shock armor ; he pulled it back and swung again . She fired the disruptor at him , his whole body spasmed , and the end of the chain whipped harmlessly past her body . But Mason managed to keep his fist clenched , managed to keep his grip on the chain . <p> The woman fired again , his chest seemed to explode , and Mason lost his balance , crumpled to the floor . He tipped forward , stiff , head stopping his fall . He had no control of his limbs , they were locked up and jittery , and he could n't right himself . <p> It was luck , really . The woman stepped forward and leaned over , looking down at him . Mason waited a few seconds , sensing the disruptor shot wearing off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His arm was still out of control , but the chain whipped around and cracked her across the face , sent her sprawling back . She hit her head against a filing cabinet , winced , then shook her head , not quite out . <p> Mason scrambled to his feet , legs wobbly , and staggered back through the open door . He still did n't have much control , and he could n't stop his momentum . He hit the low railing , tried to grab it , missed , and went over . <p> Mason fell from the catwalk , legs and arms flailing . Moonlight exploded all around him and he hit the metal roof panel of the hut with a crash . He slid down , off the edge , and landed on his side on the mosscovered ground of the clearing . <p> Mason rolled slowly and painfully onto his back and lay there a long time without moving , staring up at the bright , moonlit sky . He hurt all over , but especially his ribs , his lower back , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking sensation vibrating through him , the aftereffect of the two disruptor shots . He glanced down at his right hand , saw he still gripped the doubled chain , his knuckles scraped and white with strain . Mason eased his grip , then finally let the chain go . He closed his eyes . <p> He did not sleep . <p> He remembered . <p> Not all at once . At first the memories came to him one at a time , maybe ten , fifteen minutes apart , still discreet , out of context . Mason lay without moving , eyes sometimes open , sometimes closed , waiting for them ... <p> Out in the rough surf up to his chest , reaching out for his father who had stepped off the sand bank and into a deep trench , his father a poor swimmer and weighed down by a burlap sack filled with large and heavy clams , Mason catching hold of his father and pulling him back to the bank and safety ... <p> A riot on the Golden Gate Bridge in the middle of a rainstorm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge and falling to the gray choppy water below ... <p> Sitting in the morning sun with Alexandra , drinking coffee , cats at their feet ... <p> The smell of lemon balm and the feel of a warm breeze ... Walking into a cantina and being shot at , the first shot missing him , the second shot hitting his shoulder ... <p> ( Mason opened his eyes , twisted his head and pulled up his left sleeve , saw the scar , three inches long . ) <p> Squatting beside a stucco wall , playing with his hands in a bucket of green paint ... <p> The feel of cool sand on his bare feet ... ( The memories coming faster now ... ) <p> Walking along a dry creek bed , completely stoned and half convinced he was coming loose from the world ... <p> The deep , biting smell of creosote ... <p> Hiking up Mt . Lassen with his parents and his sisters ... <p> In a tent , alone , with the rain coming down hard , certain he would stay warm and dry ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parkside Theater in San Francisco , a theater long since torn down ... <p> Eating giant prawns in a tiny restaurant in Hawaii with a stunning view of the sunset across the water ... <p> And then his first " jump , " a shock , done out of fear , a mugger 's gun in his ribs , teleporting from the back of the streetcar to his apartment bedroom , confused about what he had just done , confused about what he was ... <p> ( But Mason knew now what he was . He knew . ) <p> And more memories , on and on and on ... <p> A kind of threshold was reached , and his past , his life slammed into him whole . It was midday now , and the sun and clouds above him began spinning . Mason turned over , tried to push himself to his feet , but lost his balance and fell back to the ground . He closed his eyes , but it did n't help . He thought he was going to vomit . He curled up on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of him once again , digging in . <p> The dizziness and nausea leaked out of him , leaving behind a stinging sweat and a jittery sensation . He opened his eyes and looked around at the jungle that he now knew was not real . He was someplace real , but the neural distorter patched into his skull was giving the place the appearance of jungle and clearing and hut . So he would n't know where he was , so he would n't be able to teleport out of it . <p> Except it had n't completely worked . <p> With no memory , no conscious knowledge that he was a jumper , <p> Mason had apparently made a blind jump , escaping from wherever they were holding him . But blind jumped to where ? <p> Mason sat up . Where was he now ? <p> He reached behind his head and felt along the base of his skull for the neural distorter . He dug gently through the hair with his fingers until he felt the narrow strip of warm metal attached to his scalp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It came away , snow fell across his vision , and he got dizzy again , nausea returning . Mason bent over , eyes closed , and waited it out . <p> When the nausea eased , he opened his eyes , sat up , and looked to see where he was . No jungle . He was squatting in the dried mud and weeds beside a cinder-block hovel on the edge of a ravine . Midday , the sun bearing down , a terrible stench rising up the steep slope . Mason knew exactly where he was . <p> Guatemala . Zona 3 of Guatemala City , Colonia Santa Isabel . A slum of a slum . A hellhole of a place that he had used to go to ground , where nobody would ever look for him because no one would ever live here by choice . <p> Mason got to his feet , still a little dizzy , the distorter in his right hand between thumb and forefinger ; the chain lay in the dirt beside him . A few feet away was a tin pail with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy for the crazy man by someone from one of the nearby shanties . The stream water ; the gourd . <p> He staggered into the one room building , which was even hotter inside than out despite the windows cut into the cinder-block . Lots of shadows . The place was a pit , strewn with garbage , a mattress of rotting foam . No radio . The radio had been part of his struggle against the distorter , his subconscious warning him that people were tracking him down . Mason picked through the trash , found a strip of stained fabric and a section of metal pipe , then went back outside . <p> He wrapped the distorter inside the fabric , tying knots around it , then tied the cloth to the pipe . He stepped to the edge of the ravine and gazed down the steep slope , almost overcome by the stench . Far below , almost invisible , was the Rio La Barranca . Mason leaned back , then threw the pipe as hard as he could to the left and away ; it arced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far below hi m and setting off the distant barking of dogs . Let the bastards search for him down among the sewage and garbage and corpses . <p> Mason sat down in the weeds , his back against the cinder-block , thinking . He 'd been a part of this war for far too long , and he did n't even really know what the sides were , or what they wanted . They had wanted to use him because he was a jumper , but other than that , what did he really know ? <p> Names . Anarchists . Reformers . Statists . Three " sides " that he knew of , and there were probably more . But what did those names really mean , if anything ? All he knew for certain was that all of them had lied to him at one time or another . And that one side or the other had killed Alexandra , and it might have been the Reformers , the side he 'd been working for , the side he 'd once foolishly believed was trying to do some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the hazy yellow and blue sky . He had tried to quit the whole business , and that 's when Alexandra had been killed . Saranday , the woman in shock armor with the disruptor , had told him the Statists had been responsible , giving him revenge as a reason to stay in . But when he 'd told her he was getting out anyway , she 'd said they would n't let him . And then , when they 'd tracked him down in that subterranean chamber , in the room with the antiquated office furniture , she 'd blasted him half a dozen times with the disruptor and , apparently , patched in the neural distorter . He did n't know what had happened after that - he still had no memory from that point until he 'd awakened in the jungle . Had his memory loss been deliberately induced , or had it been just aside-effect of the disruptor blasts ? He 'd probably never know that , either , and it did n't really matter . <p> And why had he gone to that place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buried , why had he gone to that room ? Because of the words of Silas , a dying , crazy old man , who had told him there was information in that room , information that would bring them all down . What ? Mason had asked , but Silas had just told him he would know it when he saw it , would know what to do with it . But Mason had searched all through that room , spent hours looking through files and documents , and if he 'd run across what the old man had been talking about , he had n't recognized it . More likely the dying old man had just been out of his mind . <p> Mason got to his feet , went around to the front of the cinder-block building and back inside . He picked up a dented metal plate and took it into the rear corner of the room . He knelt on the floor and began digging with the plate through the packed earth . It took him about fifteen minutes to uncover the metal box and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised the lid , removed a package wrapped tightly in several layers of sealed plastic and oilskin . <p> The package contained a passport , cash , a couple of supposedly clear , untraceable credit chips , and a 10 mm Smith &; Wesson along with two full clips . Mason put everything except the gun and clips in his pockets , then set the gun and clips on a shelf of cinder block just below the window looking out into the ravine . <p> He put one clip into the gun and jammed it home , then released it and did the same with the other clip . He left the second clip in , stuck the first in his front pocket , then stuffed the gun into the waist of his pants , trying to hide it with his loose shirt . Not very effective , and uncomfortable , but he did n't have much choice . He was n't going to try to get out of this country without it . <p> Saranday was right , of course . He would not be able to jump his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; maybe longer . The two boomerang jumps-to the cantina and the underground chamber-had drained him completely . He could wait those two days , then jump to some other place he knew . But Saranday was probably telling the truth about closing in on him here , and that would be way too risky . Besides , he had learned over the years never to make a jump unless he absolutely had to - not when it left him without the option of doing it again for two or three days . No , he 'd get out on his own - by foot , bus , car , train , whatever it took . <p> And after that , what ? He had no idea . Go after them , somehow . Keep looking for something that would bring them down , all of them . Perhaps even return to the underground chamber , search it again . Something . He had his life back , that 's what really mattered . He had his life back , and he was going to keep it . No one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interior of the hovel , making sure he was n't leaving anything behind that could identify him ; he wanted to be able to use this place again if he had to . He touched the gun , double-checked his pockets for the passport and money , then stepped out into the sun . <p> They converged on him from all directions , five , six figures in shock armor . The closest one , a man who stopped just a few feet away , held a disruptor aimed directly at him . <p> " Mason , " the man said . But nothing else . <p> Mason did n't say a thing , feeling numb and paralyzed . He looked from side to side at the men and women surrounding him . He did n't recognize any of them , but he knew who they were , and he knew what they wanted . <p> " Down on the ground , " the man with the disruptor said . " Flat , arms and legs spread . " <p> Mason could n't believe it . After all he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man with the disruptor fired . <p> The heat was killing him . From the trees came the loud chatter of monkeys and the droning buzz of insects ; a bird cawed , long and piercing . Mason did n't know where he was ; he hardly knew who he was . <p> He stumbled out of the jungle and into a clearing . A cloud of blue and white butterflies rose from the moss at his feet , fluttering about his face and momentarily blinding him . When the butterflies cleared away , he saw a hut on the other side of the clearing . <p> For some strange and unfathomable reason , the sight of the hut filled him with overwhelming despair . He took a step toward it , then stopped , unable to go on . Hopeless , and utterly lost , Mason dropped to his knees and wept . <p> Sidebar
