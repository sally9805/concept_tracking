The story goes that two chorus members of the Glyndebourne Festival Opera were returning to the green but sodden meadows of Sussex , England , after a brief break in London . One said , " I 'm so sick of all this rain . " Replied the other : " Yes , but it is privileged rain . " <P> That exchange about expresses the aura that surrounds Glyndebourne , one of the world 's finest music festivals . The very drizzle is sacred . Young singers vie for a place in the chorus . Never mind that the time commitment is extravagant and the pay meager . To perform on this stage is to be recognized as an artist , not just another pair of vocal cords . <P> Opera fans , too , struggle to get to Glyndebourne , but tickets have always been virtually unobtainable . Much of the small house , 40 miles south of London , is presold to corporate and individual sponsors . For these wealthy people , an evening at Glyndebourne is a social rite , a rare chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in black tie . But the women present a fashion show rarely witnessed in the late 20th century : long gowns printed with cabbage roses and exotic shawls that must be relics of Britain 's imperial past . For many in the Glyndebourne audience , the evening 's high point is the single , 80-minute intermission , when the ladies stride onto the smallish lawn to seize and defend their favorite picnic spot and lay out a lobster and strawberry feast as cows gaze at them indifferently from the other side of the ha-ha . <P> But Glyndebourne is changing . Last week , amid fireworks and the blessing of the Duke and Duchess of Kent , the company opened a new theater that seats 1,200  --  the original seated 830  --  and that includes about 60 places to be sold at $15 . The design is spare , even modest , making no attempt to impose itself on the landscape , and the acoustics are much better than those of the old house . At the opening , the company tried to keep gloating to a minimum . That must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opened the only new opera house in England since the first Glyndebourne theater was built 60 years ago . They had done it within their budget of $50 million . Best of all , they had fulfilled their dream without taking a cent of public money . <P> But surely the most unusual aspect of this musical Shangri-La is the fact that it is set on private property . It was built in 1934 at the will of Sir John Christie , the scion of a rich , ancient family , who saw it as a showcase for the talents of his new wife , lyric soprano Audrey Mildmay . The current proprietor , John 's son George , makes his home right next to what could be called the family store .
