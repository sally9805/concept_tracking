<p> More than class or race , three divisions increasingly define America : <p> The Wired economy . The densely packed concentration of entrepreneurs and companies in America 's urbanized states that generate virtually all the nation 's globally competitive , high-wage industries , such as multimedia , design , software , entertainment , computers , biomedical , engineering , finance and business services . <p> The Kluge economy . Slang for Rube Goldberg-like computer code that barely , if ever , achieves its purpose , Kluge describes the economy of major media , public-sector bureaucracies and universities that dominates urban politics . <p> The core urban states , where the Kluge and the Wired economies are centered , generate about 45 percent of total U.S. nonfarm employment , or about 50 million jobs . Of those jobs , about 15 percent-18 percent , on average , are directly accounted for by government and closely allied employment ( including education ) - the core Kluge constituency . <p> The Provincial economy . The rapidly growing Southern and Intermountain Western regions of the country that now dominate national politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total U.S. nonfarm employment , or 40 million jobs . <p> It is the struggle among these economies , not tired conservative and liberal rhetoric , that will determine the nation 's future . <p> The Wired economy grew up because cutting-edge industries demand a large concentration of specialized , creative firms and individuals that can rapidly design and produce products for world markets . Only urban regions offer the critical mix of bottomless talent and proximity that supercharges high-wage , high-skill sectors . It is no accident that the world 's most technologically sophisticated economies are found in metropolises such as Tokyo , Seoul , Taipei and Los Angeles . <p> Unlike its Asian neighbors , however , America 's Wired economy is constantly under attack by the Kluge economy . Composed of the last surviving caste systems in the United States - government , education institutions , major media - the Kluge economy was once instrumental in fostering metropolitan development . Over time , however , it stagnated ; today , its long decline feeds one of the most self-defeating politics in American history . <p> Public-employee unions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituents ' future by threatening an ever-expanding parade of plagues , from race riots to Dark Age epidemics , if jobs are cut from the public rolls or options for more efficient government are pursued . <p> Universities , once an urban magnet , now frequently repel creative firms and entrepreneurs with their contempt for the private economy . <p> The media , too , eagerly seize on such perspectives , because they think that declining readership or viewership can be reversed only by sensationalizing every negative aspect of the communities where their customers live . <p> It is the collision between the Wired and Kluge economies that generates the chronic urban pathologies all too apparent in modern America . <p> Turned off by Kluge rhetoric , the Wired economy migrates from central cities to less dysfunctional areas , such as New York-adjacent New Jersey , Sonoma County , north of San Francisco , or Burbank and Santa Monica , which share borders with Los Angeles . Rather than play to its strength and foster Wired industries , the Kluge economy tries to compensate by increasing the volume of its negativity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further alienates the Wired economy , reduces the local tax base and produces yet another round of Kluge apocalyptic rhetoric . <p> Gleefully exploiting the self-destructiveness of urban regions is the vast Provincial economy , which self-consciously styles itself as a more moral , less " Klugy " alternative for Wired businesses and entrepreneurs . At first glance , its conceit seems justified : Over the last few years , the nation 's fastest nonfarm-employment growth almost exclusively occurred in the South and Intermountain West . At the bottom of the heap , with growth rates far below the national average , are the most urbanized states - New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Illinois and California among them . <p> Although the Provincial economy sells itself as the new center of its Wired counterpart , a closer look shows that it 's largely unplugged . Utah , for example , the fastest-growing Provincial state , relentlessly has been hyped as the new U.S. software capital . The recently released U.S. economic census , however , shows that the state is home to just 78 prepackaged software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each have more than 1,000 . <p> Provincial economic development is driven by the redeployment of less competitive businesses and retirees to low-cost areas , not by building globally competitive industries . Its high-growth core is an honor roll of low-skill , low-wage states : Nevada , Louisiana , Georgia , Arizona and Oregon . Self-congratulatory and smug , the Provincial economy actually offers America a 19th-century answer for 21st-century competition . <p> The interplay of the three economies creates crucial , but still unrecognized challenges for America . The nation 's high-skill , high-wage industrial growth is throttled by the dominance of Kluge politics in urban centers . The Provincial industries that America fosters outside of its stalemated urban regions offer the nation a one-way ticket to a second-class society . And the American pattern of slow Wired-economic growth , coupled with rapid Provincial expansion , generates fewer and fewer surplus resources that can be used to cope with the country 's underclass , a problem even the most remote Provincial states can not hope to evade . <p> Yet , the peculiar feature of American politics is that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard-bearer for the Kluges . Trapped by their bureaucratic , public-sector base , they can offer only the most leaden , 1930s-era metaphors - the " information superhighway " or the " National Information Infrastructure , " for example - when they discuss Wired issues . <p> The Provincial economy is solidly Republican . Superficially , it promises the Wired economy a high-tech but family-value world , combining the security of small-town America with Internet links to maintain urban contacts . Wired businesses know , however , that not only are faxes and e-mail poor substitutes for the constant interpersonal transactions that drive their sectors , they are also competing against other countries , like Japan , where companies enjoy both global network access and dense physical proximity . To lead the pack , a firm has to be wired where the action is , not surfing the web from an Idaho bunker . <p> Many of the people creating the nation 's high-wage urban industries are so alienated from mainstream parties , in fact , that they have become anti-politics , living in the quixotic hope that government will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores of interviews with Wired-business owners and their top employees reveal a common message of indifference , if not contempt , for conventional politics . <p> " Government does n't understand us , " many say , " and it is largely irrelevant to what we do . " When government or universities announce yet another bureaucratic " high-tech " program , it is often dismissed out of hand by Wired businesses , which discount the possibility that out-of-touch academics , using outmoded equipment in projects managed by slow-motion public bureaucracies , could possibly generate anything of value for them . <p> Living in the shadow of urban Kluge politics , much of the Wired economy has simply shifted to stealth mode , or has even gone underground . Given current choices , as mayoral elections in Los Angeles and New York dramatically illustrate , the Wired economy will increasingly vote - in a desultory fashion , to be sure - for the candidates who will least harm it , generally the Republicans . Stuck between the archaic nostrums offered by both the Kluges and the Provincials , the Wired economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more positive result , and one with tremendous potential payoffs for the politicians who can embrace it , is to directly address the concerns of the Wired economy . To do this , the mainstream parties will have to reshape their philosophies , or a third alternative may be necessary . A central goal of Wired politics , for example , is to unshackle the cities from the remarkably disproportionate tax and regulatory burdens years of Kluge and Provincial political rule have imposed . This would return funds from federal and state governments to the regional firms that actually invest in local businesses and create jobs - at the cost , to be sure , of tax " grants " to Kluge constituencies . <p> Meanwhile , the Provincial economy will have to accept that income-based tax and government spending , plus America 's regulatory structure , greatly tilt the economic playing field in favor of low-wage , elderly populations living in more rural states . These burdens must be equalized , in real terms , so that tax and regulatory arbitrage alone does not artificially pump resources from the Wired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states . <p> Finally , a Wired political agenda would unite urban regions that , against all logic , persist in attacking each other , rather than dealing with their real competitors in the Provincial economy . New York and Los Angeles share an overriding common agenda in responding to the cultural , political and economic challenges mounted by Georgia , Utah and other Provincial states , an agenda they , and other major metropolises , have yet to pursue . <p> As the United States girds for its next national elections , much of the nation 's future prosperity and social stability will depend on rediscovering its forgotten , but critical , Wired constituency . Given the alternatives , it is increasingly clear that America can ill-afford to treat its most productive , competitive economy as an afterthought rather than as the central focus of national politics . <p> David Friedman , an urban economist , was director of the New Economy Project and is president of an international consulting firm .
