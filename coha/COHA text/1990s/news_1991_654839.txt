<p> SOUTH AFRICAN athletes have a new spring in their step at the prospect of returning to international sports after nearly three decades of isolation under apartheid rule . <p> Soccer , the most popular and most integrated sport - racially mixed since the late 1970s - is set to lead the country back into the international arena by September , the date by which President Frederik de Klerk has vowed apartheid laws will be scrapped . <p> " It will be a big boost to get into world soccer , " says Zane Moosa , one of the country 's most promising midfielders and a prime candidate for a South African national team . <p> Soccer is likely to be followed by track and field , cricket , and rugby - the sport favored by the ruling Afrikaner minority . <p> Coaches are discussing what was unthinkable only a year ago - a South African team to bid for three African places at the World Cup in the United States in 1994 . ( Here , soccer is the only team sport dominated by blacks . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a top black team to gain recognition in the sport , " says Mr. Moosa , a South African of mixed-race who plays for the largely black Mamelodi Sundowns . <p> There are 1.2 million registered soccer players here , and the South African Football Association ( SAFA ) , formerly the National Soccer League ( NSL ) draws 5 million spectators annually . These figures dwarf those of the two favorite " white " sports - rugby and cricket . <p> South Africa 's exclusion from international sports competition has been one of the most effective sanctions applied , political scientists and diplomats say . Now that the end of apartheid is in sight , international lobby groups have begun to make a distinction between economic sanctions and the sports boycott , signaling that the time has come to drop the latter . <p> The International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) has given South Africa until September to scrap apartheid and unify fragmented sporting bodies . The African National Congress ( ANC ) , despite slow progress on political negotiations , has been actively promoting sports unity . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international boycott rapidly is being eroded by an African-led push for South Africa 's return to the Olympics . On April 15 , IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch said South Africa 's presence at the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona was " virtually certain " if the scheduled repeal of apartheid laws in June went ahead . <p> But decades of isolation have taken a heavy toll on the country 's athletes and on the standard of team sports like soccer , rugby , and cricket . <p> In the past , predominantly white sports ( rugby , cricket , golf ) have taken the lion 's share of sponsor money , but predominantly black soccer has been increasing its share dramatically in recent years . <p> " There will be massive profits for sport when the international tours come to South Africa , " says former South African cricket captain Ali Bacher , who now heads a national program to teach cricket to children in black townships . <p> Bacher says there is massive untapped talent in the black townships : " Once you get one black champion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Bacher already has someone in mind . He is 15-year-old Andrew Masemola , already a legend in Alexandra township . " I am confident that he can get to the top of South African cricket within five years , " says Bacher . <p> Ironically , one of South Africa 's best hopes in the Olympics is an American . Javelin thrower Tom Petranoff came to live in South Africa recently after being blacklisted by the United Nations for competing in South Africa in violation of the international sports boycott . Petranoff , whose best throw in South Africa is one meter short of the world record , has applied for South African citizenship and could still make the national team if immigration formalities are waived . <p> The surprise could be soccer . Given the long period of isolation ( see accompanying chronology ) , South Africa 's ability in team sports is difficult to judge . <p> " South Africa has been compared to Brazil when it comes to ball skills , " says soccer midfielder Moosa . " With our style of football - well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever happens we will make an impression . We have some talented players and many of them will get noticed . " <p> IT was Afro-Asian protests that persuaded the IOC to withdraw an invitation to South Africa to attend the Olympics in Mexico City in 1968 - after limited relaxation of apartheid in sport . On March 10 this year , at a meeting of the African National Olympic Committee in Botswana , it was again the African lobby that took the lead - this time by recognizing the interim National Olympic Committee of South Africa ( NOCSA ) , thus paving the way for a return to the Olympic fold . <p> SOUTH AFRICA 'S impact on world sport is likely to be greatest in track and field events , where half-a-dozen or so black marathon runners are among the best in the world . <p> Track is fairly evenly divided between black and white . <p> Marcel Winkler , a mixed-race 19-year-old student at the predominantly Afrikaans Pretoria University , was the fastest women 's junior ( under 19 ) in the world in the 100-meter dash last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time has been bettered only by 26-year-old Evette de Klerk , a white Olympic hopeful , who notched her best time of 11.06 seconds in a race with Marcel last year , giving her sixth place in world rankings . <p> Marcel , who is recovering from a leg injury is excited about the prospect of running in the Olympics . " I 'm already starting to build myself up , " she says . " My dream is to run in the Olympics and win a medal for South Africa . " <p> The prospect of returning to international sport has created waves of excitement among South African athletes and coaches , but some are wary about setting their expectations too high . <p> " The politicians are dangling a carrot to get what they want , but I am not convinced , " says track and field coach John Short , who trains Marcel Winkler and other Olympic hopefuls . <p> Mr. Short , for one , does not believe that the anti-apartheid lobby is about to abandon its war cry : " No normal sport in an abnormal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in international sport until there is majority rule in South Africa , " he says .
