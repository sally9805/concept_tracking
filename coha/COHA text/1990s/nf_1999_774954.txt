Sort Out the Three Conversations // Jack is about to have a difficult conversation . // He explains : " Late one afternoon I got a call from Michael , a good friend and occasional client . I 'm in a tight spot , ' he told me . I need a financial brochure laid out and printed by tomorrow afternoon . ' He said his regular designer was out and that he was under a lot of pressure . // " I was in the middle of another project , but Michael was a friend , so I dropped everything and worked late into the night on his brochure . // " Early the next morning Michael reviewed the mock-up and gave the go-ahead to have it printed . I had the copies on his desk by noon . I was exhausted , but I was glad I 'd been able to help him out . // " Then I got back to my office and discovered this voice-mail message from Michael : // Well , you really screwed this one up ! Look , Jack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but .... sigh . The earnings chart is n't presented clearly enough , and it 's slightly off . It 's just a disaster . This is an important client . I assume you 'll fix it right away . Give me a call as soon as you get in. // " Well , you can imagine how I felt about that message . The chart was off , but microscopically . I called Michael right away . " // Their conversation went like this : // Jack : Hi , Michael , I got your message  --  // Michael : Yeah , look Jack , this thing has to be done over . // Jack : Well , wait a second . I agree it 's not perfect , but the chart is clearly labeled . Nobody 's going to misunderstand  --  // Michael : C'm on , Jack . You know as well as I do that we ca n't send this thing out like this . // Jack : Well , I think that  --  // Michael : There 's really nothing to argue about here . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's move on . // Jack : Why did n't you say something about this when you looked at it this morning ? // Michael : I 'm not the one who 's supposed to be proofreading . Jack , I 'm under tremendous pressure to get this done and to get it done right . Either you 're on the team or you 're not . I need a yes or a no . Are you going to redo it ? // Jack : pause Alright , alright . I 'll do it . // This exchange has all the hallmarks of a difficult conversation going off the rails . Months later , Jack still feels lousy about this conversation and his relationship with Michael remains strained . He wonders what he could have done differently , and what he should do about it now . // But before we get to that , let 's look at what Jack and Michael 's conversation can teach us about how difficult conversations work . // Decoding the Structure of Difficult Conversations // Surprisingly , despite what appear to be infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you 're caught up in the details and anxiety of a particular difficult conversation , this structure is hard to see . But understanding that structure is essential to improving how you handle your most challenging conversations . // There 's More Here Than Meets the Ear // In the conversation between Jack and Michael recounted above , the words reveal only the surface of what is really going on . To make the structure of a difficult conversation visible , we need to understand not only what is said , but also what is not said . We need to understand what the people involved are thinking and feeling but not saying to each other . In a difficult conversation , this is usually where the real action is. // Look at what Jack is thinking and feeling , but not saying , as this conversation proceeds : // What Jack Thought and Felt But Did n't Say // How could he leave a message like that ? ! After I drop everything , break a dinner date with my wife , and stay up all night , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overreaction . Not even a CPA would be able to tell that the graph is off . At the same time , I 'm angry with myself for making such a stupid mistake . // Michael tries to intimidate colleagues into getting his way . But he should n't treat me that way . I 'm a friend ! I want to stand up for myself , but I do n't want to get into a big fight about this . I ca n't afford to lose Michael as a client or as a friend . I feel stuck . // Screw up ! ? This is n't my fault . You approved it , remember ? // Is that how you see me ? As a proofreader ? // I 'm sick of this whole thing . I 'm going to be bigger than whatever pettiness is driving him . The best way out is for me just to be generous and redo it . // What Jack and Michael Actually Said // Jack : Hi , Michael , I got your message  --  // Michael : Yeah , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Jack : Well , wait a second . I agree it 's not perfect , but the chart is clearly labeled . Nobody 's going to misunderstand  --  // Michael : C'm on , Jack , you know as well as I do that we ca n't send this thing out like this . // Jack : Well , I think that  --  // Michael : There 's really nothing to argue about here . Look , we all screw up . Just fix it and let 's move on . // Jack : Why did n't you say something about this when you looked at it this morning ? // Michael : I 'm not the one who 's supposed to be proofreading . I 'm under tremendous pressure to get this done and to get it done right . Either you 're on the team or you 're not . I need a yes or a no . Are you going to redo it ? // Jack : pause Alright , alright . I 'll do it . // Meanwhile , there 's plenty that Michael is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether he should have hired Jack in the first place . He has n't been all that happy with Jack 's work in the past , but he decided to go out on a limb with his partners to give his friend another chance . Michael is now frustrated with Jack and confused about whether hiring Jack was a good decision  --  personally or professionally . // The first insight , then , is a simple one : there 's an awful lot going on between Jack and Michael that is not being spoken . // That 's typical . In fact , the gap between what you 're really thinking and what you 're saying is part of what makes a conversation difficult . You 're distracted by all that 's going on inside . You 're uncertain about what 's okay to share , and what 's better left unsaid . And you know that just saying what you 're thinking would probably not make the conversation any easier . // Each Difficult Conversation Is Really Three Conversations // In studying hundreds of conversations of every kind we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on , and understanding this structure , in itself , is a powerful first step in improving how we deal with these conversations . It turns out that no matter what the subject , our thoughts and feelings fall into the same three categories , or " conversations . " And in each of these conversations we make predictable errors that distort our thoughts and feelings , and get us into trouble . // Everything problematic that Michael and Jack say , think , and feel falls into one of these three " conversations . " And everything in your difficult conversations does too . // 1 . The " What Happened ? " Conversation . Most difficult conversations involve disagreement about what has happened or what should happen . Who said what and who did what ? Who 's right , who meant what , and who 's to blame ? Jack and Michael tussle over these issues , both out loud and internally . Does the chart need to be redone ? Is Michael trying to intimidate Jack ? Who should have caught the error ? // 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and answers questions about feelings . Are my feelings valid ? Appropriate ? Should I acknowledge or deny them , put them on the table or check them at the door ? What do I do about the other person 's feelings ? What if they are angry or hurt ? Jack 's and Michael 's thoughts are littered with feelings . For example , " This is the thanks I get ? ! " signals hurt and anger , and " I 'm under tremendous pressure " reveals anxiety . These feelings are not addressed directly in the conversation , but they leak in anyway . // 3 . The Identity Conversation This is the conversation we each have with ourselves about what this situation means to us . We conduct an internal debate over whether this means we are competent or incompetent , a good person or bad , worthy of love or unlovable . What impact might it have on our self-image and self-esteem , our future and our well-being ? Our answers to these questions determine in large part whether we feel " balanced " during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the conversation between Jack and Michael , Jack is struggling with the sense that he has been incompetent , which makes him feel less balanced . And Michael is wondering whether he acted foolishly in hiring Jack . // Every difficult conversation involves grappling with these Three Conversations , so engaging successfully requires learning to operate effectively in each of the three realms . Managing all three simultaneously may seem hard , but it 's easier than facing the consequences of engaging in difficult conversations blindly. // What We Ca n't Change , and What We Can // No matter how skilled we become , there are certain challenges in each of the Three Conversations that we ca n't change . We will still run into situations where untangling " what happened " is more complicated than we initially suspect . We will each have information the other person is unaware of , and raising each other 's awareness is not easy . And we will still face emotionally charged situations that feel threatening because they put important aspects of our identity at risk . // What we can change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Typically , instead of exploring what information the other person might have that we do n't , we assume we know all we need to know to understand and explain things . Instead of working to manage our feelings constructively , we either try to hide them or let loose in ways that we later regret . Instead of exploring the identity issues that may be deeply at stake for us ( or them ) , we proceed with the conversation as if it says nothing about us  --  and never come to grips with what is at the heart of our anxiety . // By understanding these errors and the havoc they wreak , we can begin to craft better approaches . Let 's explore each conversation in more depth . // The " What Happened ? " Conversation : What 's the Story Here ? // The " What Happened ? " Conversation is where we spend much of our time in difficult conversations as we struggle with our different stories about who 's right , who meant what , and who 's to blame . On each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame  --  we make a common but crippling assumption . Straightening out each of these assumptions is essential to improving our ability to handle difficult conversations well . // The Truth Assumption // As we argue vociferously for our view , we often fail to question one crucial assumption upon which our whole stance in the conversation is built : I am right , you are wrong . This simple assumption causes endless grief . // What am I right about ? I am right that you drive too fast . I am right that you are unable to mentor younger colleagues . I am right that your comments at Thanksgiving were inappropriate . I am right that the patient should have received more medication after such a painful operation . I am right that the contractor overcharged me . I am right that I deserve a raise . I am right that the brochure is fine as it is . The number of things I am right about would fill a book . // There 's only one hitch : I am not right . // How could this be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right sometimes ! // Well , no . The point is this : difficult conversations are almost never about getting the facts right . They are about conflicting perceptions , interpretations , and values . They are not about what a contract states , they are about what a contract means . They are not about which child-rearing book is most popular , they are about which child-rearing book we should follow . // They are not about what is true , they are about what is important . // Let 's come back to Jack and Michael . There is no dispute about whether the graph is accurate or not . They both agree it is not . The dispute is over whether the error is worth worrying about and , if so , how to handle it . These are not questions of right and wrong , but questions of interpretation and judgment . Interpretations and judgments are important to explore . In contrast , the quest to determine who is right and who is wrong is a dead end . // In the " What Happened ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shift our purpose from proving we are right to understanding the perceptions , interpretations , and values of both sides . It allows us to move away from delivering messages and toward asking questions , exploring how each person is making sense . of the world . And to offer our views as perceptions , interpretations , and values  --  not as " the truth . " // The Intention Invention // The second argument in the " What Happened ? " Conversation is over intentions  --  yours and mine . Did you yell at me to hurt my feelings or merely to emphasize your point ? Did you throw my cigarettes out because you 're trying to control my behavior or because you want to help me live up to my commitment to quit ? What I think about your intentions will affect how I think about you and , ultimately , how our conversation goes . // The error we make in the realm of intentions is simple but profound : we assume we know the intentions of others when we do n't . Worse still , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often decide they are bad . // The truth is , intentions are invisible . We assume them from other people 's behavior . In other words , we make them up , we invent them . But our invented stories about other people 's intentions are accurate much less often than we think . Why ? Because people 's intentions , like so much else in difficult conversations , are complex . Sometimes people act with mixed intentions . Sometimes they act with no intention , or at least none related to us . And sometimes they act on good intentions that nonetheless hurt us. // Because our view of others ' intentions ( and their views of ours ) are so important in difficult conversations , leaping to unfounded assumptions can be a disaster . // The Blame Frame // The third error we make in the " What Happened ? " Conversation has to do with blame . Most difficult conversations focus significant attention on who 's to blame for the mess we 're in . When the company loses its biggest client , for example , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame roulette . We do n't care where the ball lands , as long as it does n't land on us . Personal relationships are no different . Your relationship with your stepmother is strained ? She 's to blame . She should stop bugging you about your messy room and the kids you hang out with . // In the conflict between Jack and Michael , Jack believes the problem is Michael 's fault : the time to declare your hypersensitivity to formatting is before the brochure goes to print , not after . And , of course , Michael believes the problem is Jack 's fault : Jack did the layout , mistakes are his responsibility . // But talking about fault is similar to talking about truth  --  it produces disagreement , denial , and little learning . It evokes fears of punishment and insists on an either/or answer . Nobody wants to be blamed , especially unfairly , so our energy goes into defending ourselves . // Parents of small children know this well . When the twins act up in the back seat of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield an outcry : " But she hit me first ! " or " I hit her because she called me a baby . " Each child denies blame not just to avoid losing her dessert , but also from a sense of justice . Neither feels like the problem is solely her fault , because it isn't. // From the front seat looking back , it is easy to see how each child has contributed to the fight . It 's much more difficult to see how we 've contributed to the problems in which we ourselves are involved . But in situations that give rise to difficult conversations , it is almost always true that what happened is the result of things both people did  --  or failed to do . And punishment is rarely relevant or appropriate . When competent , sensible people do something stupid , the smartest move is to try to figure out , first , what kept them from seeing it coming and , second , how to prevent the problem from happening again . // Talking about blame distracts us from exploring why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . Focusing instead on understanding the contribution system allows us to learn about the real causes of the problem , and to work on correcting them . The distinction between blame and contribution may seem subtle . But it is a distinction worth working to understand , because it will make a significant difference in your ability to handle difficult conversations . // The Feelings Conversation : What Should We Do with Our Emotions ? // Difficult conversations are not just about what happened ; they also involve emotion . The question is not whether strong feelings will arise , but how to handle them when they do . Should you tell your boss how you really feel about his management style , or about the colleague who stole your idea ? Should you share with your sister how hurt you feel that she stayed friends with your ex ? And what should you do with the anger you are likely to experience if you decide to talk with that vendor about his sexist remarks ? // In the presence of strong feelings , many of us work hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clouds good judgment , and in some contexts  --  for example , at work  --  can seem just plain inappropriate . Bringing up feelings can also be scary or uncomfortable , and can make us feel vulnerable . After all , what if the other person dismisses our feelings or responds without real understanding ? Or takes our feelings to heart in a way that wounds them or irrevocably damages the relationship ? And once we 've gotten our feelings off our chest , it 's their turn . Are we up to hearing all about their anger and pain ? // This line of reasoning suggests that we stay out of the Feelings Conversation altogether  --  that Jack is better off not sharing his feelings of anger and hurt , or Michael his sense of disappointment . Better to stick to questions about the brochure . Better to stick to " business . " // Or is it ? // An Opera Without Music // The problem with this reasoning is that it fails to take account of one simple fact : difficult conversations do not just involve feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feelings are not some noisy byproduct of engaging in difficult talk , they are an integral part of the conflict . Engaging in a difficult conversation without talking about feelings is like staging an opera without the music . You 'll get the plot but miss the point . In the conversation between Jack and Michael , for example , Jack never explicitly says that he feels mistreated or underappreciated , yet months later Jack can still summon his anger and resentment toward Michael . // Consider some of your own difficult conversations . What feelings are involved ? Hurt or anger ? Disappointment , shame , confusion ? Do you feel treated unfairly or without respect ? For some of us , even saying " I love you " or " I 'm proud of you " can feel risky . // In the short term , engaging in a difficult conversation without talking about feelings may save you time and reduce your anxiety . It may also seem like a way to avoid certain serious risks  --  to you , to others , and to the relationship . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what have you accomplished if you do n't address them ? // Understanding feelings , talking about feelings , managing feelings  --  these are among the greatest challenges of being human . There is nothing that will make dealing with feelings easy and risk-free . Most of us , however , can do a better job in the Feelings Conversation than we are now . It may not seem like it , but talking about feelings is a skill that can be learned . // Of course , it does n't always make sense to discuss feelings . As the saying goes , sometimes you should let sleeping dogs lie . Unfortunately , a lack of skill in discussing feelings may cause you to avoid not only sleeping dogs , but all dogs  --  even those that wo n't let you sleep . // The Identity Conversation : What Does This Say About Me ? // Of the Three Conversations , the Identity Conversation may be the most subtle and the most challenging . But it offers us significant leverage in managing our anxiety and improving our skills in the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's all about who we are and how we see ourselves . How does what happened affect my self-esteem , my self-image , my sense of who I am in the world ? What impact will it have on my future ? What self-doubts do I harbor ? In short : before , during , and after the difficult conversation , the Identity Conversation is about what I am saying to myself about me . // You might think , " I 'm just trying to ask my boss for a raise . Why does my sense of who I am in the world matter here ? " Or Jack might be thinking , " This is about the brochure , not about me . " In fact , anytime a conversation feels difficult , it is in part precisely because it is about You , with a capital Y . Something beyond the apparent substance of the conversation is at stake for you . // It may be something simple . What does it say about you when you talk to your neighbors about their dog ? It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong self-image as a friendly person and good neighbor , so you are uncomfortable with the possibility that your neighbors might see you as aggressive or as a troublemaker. // Asking for a raise ? What if you get turned down ? In fact , what if your boss gives you good reasons for turning you down ? What will that do to your self-image as a competent and respected employee ? Ostensibly the subject is money , but what 's really making you sweat is that your self-image is on the line . // Even when you are the one delivering bad news , the Identity Conversation is in play . Imagine , for example , that you have to turn down an attractive new project proposal from Creative . The prospect of telling the people involved makes you anxious , even if you are n't responsible for the decision . In part , it 's because you fear how the conversation will make you feel about yourself : " I 'm not the kind of person who lets people down and crushes enthusiasm . I 'm the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for shutting the door . " Your self-image as a person who helps others get things done butts up against the reality that you are going to be saying no . If you 're no longer the hero , will people see you as the villain ? // Keeping Your Balance // As you begin to sense the implications of the conversation for your self-image , you may begin to lose your balance . The eager young head of Creative , who reminds you so much of yourself at that age , looks disbelieving and betrayed . You suddenly feel confused ; your anxiety skyrockets . You wonder whether it really makes sense to drop the idea so early in the process . Before you know it , you stammer out something about the possibility that the rejection will be reconsidered , even though you have absolutely no reason to believe that 's likely . // In its mildest form , losing our balance may cause us to lose confidence in ourselves , to lose concentration , or to forget what we were going to say . In more extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralyzed , overcome by panic , stricken with an urge to flee , or even have trouble breathing . // Just knowing that the Identity Conversation is a component of difficult conversations can help . And , as in the other two conversations , you can do much better than mere awareness . While losing your balance sometimes is inevitable , the Identity Conversation need not cause as much anxiety as it does . Like dealing with feelings , grappling with the Identity Conversation gets easier with the development of certain skills . Indeed , once you find your footing in the Identity Conversation , you can turn what is often a source of anxiety into a source of strength . // Moving Toward a Learning Conversation // Despite what we sometimes pretend , our initial purpose for having a difficult conversation is often to prove a point , to give them a piece of our mind , or to get them to do or be what we want . In other words , to deliver a message . // Once you understand the challenges inherent in the Three Conversations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find that your purpose for having a particular conversation begins to shift . You come to appreciate role feelings have to play , and what the issues mean to each person 's self-esteem and identity . And you find that a message delivery stance no longer makes sense . In fact , you may find that you no longer have a message to deliver , but rather some information to share and some questions to ask . // Instead of wanting to persuade and get your way , you want to understand what has happened from the other person 's point of view , explain your point of view , share and understand feelings , and work together to figure out a way to manage the problem going forward . In so doing , you make it more likely that the other person will be open to being persuaded , and that you will learn something that significantly changes the way you understand the problem . // Changing our stance means inviting the other person into the conversation with us , to help us figure things out . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to learn from them and lots they need to learn from us . We need to have a learning conversation . // The differences between a typical battle of messages and a learning conversation are summarized in the chart on the following pages . // ( Continues ... )
