Section : U.S. News The president awaits his punishment <p> When Sherwood Boehlert first came to Congress 16 years ago , the freshman lawmaker cast an impossibly difficult vote . He approved the deployment of troops to Lebanon , knowing that his son , a Green Beret , would likely be among those shipped to that tortured land  --  like Abraham binding Isaac for sacrifice . " But that was nothing , " Boehlert says , " compared to what I now face . " <p> This week , the Republican moderate from Utica , N.Y. , will help decide the impeachment of a president . " With Lebanon , the right thing was clear . Here , I stay up at night tossing and turning . I get up early , so I wo n't have to agonize in bed , " he says . After a career of relative obscurity  --  securing dairy subsidies , sponsoring Pledge of Allegiance Day  --  Boehlert finds the media suddenly banging down his door . It got so bad that Boehlert flew home last week to clear his head back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the arguments . My plan now is to go into the woods for a long walk . . . . I 'm not part of the Christian Coalition , " he tells an interviewer , " but say a prayer for me . " <p> Washington 's bizarre , sometimes farcical political circus has suddenly turned deadly serious . Perhaps it was the wording of the four impeachment articles that finally concentrated minds : " Wherefore , William Jefferson Clinton . . . warrants impeachment and trial , and removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor , trust or profit under the United States . " <p> The drama has acquired the pacing of a John Grisham novel . Sensing momentum shifting against him , Clinton made a hurried appeal in which he agreed to be censured to spare himself the shame of impeachment . But 10 minutes after he delivered his Rose Garden apology , the Judiciary Committee voted out the first of four articles of impeachment , to be considered by House members this week . " Should they determine that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the president said , " I am ready to accept that . " <p> But was he really ? Critics said the president still did n't seem to fathom the difference between misleading and lying . And even defenders and some White House aides said the president did himself little good with the perfunctory address and worried that it might be his last chance to win enough converts to block an impeachment vote . <p> Impeachment is America 's lawful coup , the democratic substitute for beheading the king . It is one of those moments when history pauses , lingers , observes , judges . And its outcome will now be determined , not by Kenneth Starr or Newt Gingrich or Clinton , but by Boehlert and Van Hilleary and Sue Kelly  --  40 or so undecided , relatively moderate politicians most Americans have never heard of . <p> After a year of bitter partisanship , a few flexible pragmatists from both parties have become the custodians of American conscience : Frank Riggs from Windsor , Calif. , glued all day to C-SPAN " even though I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hobson of Springfield , Ohio , poring over Black 's Law Dictionary to better understand perjury . Beneath all the squalor of the scandal , this is a reaffirmation of the democratic faith : that ordinary people are expected , and sometimes required , to assume extraordinary responsibility . <p> " All the marbles . " The fight for this group 's loyalty , or at least forbearance , has become the fight of the Clinton presidency , for what former Chief of Staff Leon Panetta terms " all the marbles . " " There was a false euphoria that came out of the November election that assumed the election was the primary battle , " he says . And that euphoria , as Republicans seemed to retreat from impeachment toward censure , led to miscalculations , like the president 's strained , legalistic responses to the Judiciary Committee 's 81 questions . " Those answers set us back with moderate Republicans , " admits Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana , a respected Democrat helping the administration reach out across the aisle . <p> Others fault the president 's tone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look like a character in a Dostoevsky novel who is going through this great , passionate fight with himself , " says political analyst Stuart Rothenberg . " If he would just stop smiling so much . " <p> But last week , swagger gave way to grim sobriety . Clinton 's message to the moderates is straightforward : His actions were sinful but not impeachable , and his explanations were evasive but not perjurious . But there is debate over what his next move should be . Plan A calls for more contrition : accepting a resolution of censure and a fine , and signing an admission that he demeaned his office . This expanded wardrobe of hair shirts would give the undecided a clear alternative to impeachment , and is the most likely White House endgame . <p> For some Democrats , the tougher the censure the better  --  an ironic reverse of the old Clinton " triangulation " strategy . In this calculus , Democrats win points by being tough on Clinton , at the same time leaving him to swing in the wind by himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pushing for censure but may vote to impeach if no censure resolution is allowed on the floor . " We want to know what their issues are in the impeachment debate , what their problems are , " says a senior Clinton strategist . " We 'll do whatever is most effective . " <p> The problem is , no one in the White House seemed to know what would work and what would n't . As the Judiciary Committee was preparing to vote late last week , the all-important bloc of about 20 Republican moderates in the House that Clinton was banking on seemed to be leaning impeachment 's way . That should have come as no surprise . Aides suspect that Clinton 's arguments for censure are being outweighed by fear among GOP moderates that the Republican right will challenge them in the 2000 primaries if they do n't go for impeachment . <p> Last chance . Sensing defeat , the White House suddenly shifted to Plan B : having the president take his case directly to the people , to send a wake-up call to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle East . After saying , again , that he was " profoundly sorry " for having " misled " people , he opened the door to being slapped with the censure-fine deal his advisers have been pushing . " I understand that accountability demands consequences , and I am prepared to accept them . " What he did n't say  --  the word that so many wanted to hear  --  was that he had lied . Republicans and his own aides quickly judged the appearance a failure at winning any key votes . <p> The only hope was that the publicity might start a spark of outrage among Americans who continue to say by about 60 percent that they oppose impeachment . After months of hoping the country was tuning out all things Monica , Clinton and his strategists suddenly want Americans to focus on the scandal and the impeachment proceedings . Democratic members of Congress , and ultimately Clinton himself , would argue that while he is sorry for his sins , it would hurt everyday Americans to put the country through an impeachment ordeal and trial in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and make it nearly impossible to do the country 's business . Says one White House aide : " We want people to see impeachment as a serious threat . The idea is to get people to stand up on their hind legs and call their members to oppose impeachment . " <p> Clinton may try to win their sympathy again with another public plea on the eve of a House vote scheduled for this Thursday . Some voters say they 'd be upset if their representative voted to impeach but that it would n't necessarily affect their decision in the voting booth . " He and I will have to talk , " Tammy Mitchell , a nurse anesthetist , told a reporter outside Philadelphia about her congressman , Pennsylvania Republican Jon Fox . But as for how she 'd cast her vote next time around , she says : " It would depend on who 's the best candidate . " <p> Some polling experts are skeptical that a backlash could materialize on short notice in a nation currently so serenely disengaged from politics . " Americans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service . " They do n't care what goes on in foreign countries . And Washington has become a foreign country . " Just as Americans did not respond passionately in favor of impeachment , they may not respond passionately against it , confirming what Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut calls " an eerie quiet . " " Anger means that people care , " argues pollster John Zogby , " but , so far , voters do n't care . They do n't see how any of this connects with their life . " <p> What , then , might prevent a House showdown ? Nothing . Unless some drastic event changes the locked-in positions of the Republican leadership and the White House , the impeachment votes will occur , and the only question remaining is whether the House would be allowed to consider a censure resolution afterward . " You 're not going to get censure , " insists a top House GOP leadership aide . " It 's always been impossible . " Republican opposition to censure will provoke howls of protest from Democrats , but House rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote on censure . It seems the only way censure could fly in the House is if Clinton admits he broke the law . Only this " could spare the nation the ordeal of an impeachment trial in the Senate , " says Republican Rep. Bob Franks of New Jersey , who complains the president 's speech did n't go nearly far enough . " The president continues to put his own self-interest ahead of the interests of the nation , " Franks says , " by refusing to take personal responsibility for his actions . " <p> But White House insiders say it 's unlikely the president will ever fess up . As in his Rose Garden statement , he will only admit he committed a sin and was misleading and evasive about it . " He 's said he 's sorry , " says a senior adviser . " If there is an enormous move for him to say he 's sorry again , he 'll do it . But he 's not going to say he committed perjury . He does n't believe it . " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady and her close pal , senior adviser Sidney Blumenthal , and the legal team led by David Kendall and Charles Ruff , that the president must be careful not to hand Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr any evidence he could use to prosecute Clinton after he leaves office . Starr 's office clearly has not ruled out that possibility , although the independent counsel was pointedly mum on the issue last week to avoid tilting sentiment on Capitol Hill in the sensitive days before the vote . <p> Tattered reputation . If the House votes for impeachment , few predict that two thirds of the Senate will remove President Clinton from office ( box , right ) . And this will be a victory of sorts , ensuring that Bill Clinton will not just be remembered as a sinner but as a survivor as well . Yet these events also illustrate how some victories are so costly that they are indistinguishable from defeat . <p> In last week 's impeachment hearings , President Clinton was variously called " morally reprehensible , " " evasive , " " misleading , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated the trust of the American people , lessened their esteem for the office of president , and dishonored the office which they have entrusted to him . " And all these statements were made by his political defenders , not his detractors . The goal was to admit venality while denying criminality . " It served the president 's purpose , " says a Democratic Hill staffer , " but it did not enhance his reputation . " <p> Whatever the outcome , there is a lesson to be found here at the crossroads of power and human nature . And though Richard Nixon 's scandal is distant and different from this one , he understood that lesson in the end : " So you are lean and mean and resourceful , " he said , " and you continue to walk on the edge of the precipice because over the years you have become fascinated by how close you can walk without losing your balance .

LIKE-MINDED : Harris Fawell of Illinois , Paul McHale of Pennsylvania <p> By Franklin Foer <p> Section : U.S. News Next , the Senate ? Conviction 's unlikely  --  not impossible <p> President Clinton 's defenders warn that a Senate impeachment trial would be a " horror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe plunging the world into economic chaos . The truth is no one knows how it would play out . But there 's ample evidence to suggest that a Senate trial would not be nearly so disruptive or traumatic . In fact , it may not even occur . <p> One possible scenario if Clinton is impeached this week : Republicans and Democrats could vote to dismiss the trial as soon as it begins  --  and go for censure instead . A motion to dismiss requires 51 votes ( there are 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats in the Senate ) . " One could imagine discussions among senators of both parties for a censure that would work with a motion to dismiss , " says Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut , a close Clinton ally who delivered a stinging rebuke of the president 's behavior in September and is considered a bellwether in Senate deliberations . But Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey says a " deeply divisive and all-consuming " trial is required to fulfill the chamber 's constitutional obligations . However , he does n't believe the votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Senate would " very likely " vote for censure . <p> Of course , any such estimations must be stacked against the conventional wisdom of two weeks ago that the House would never impeach Clinton . If it does , anything 's possible in the Senate , where approval of two thirds of the members  --  67 senators  --  would be needed to convict and remove Clinton from office . " I just do n't know what will happen . Everyone is assuming the Senate will not convict , but no senator has declared a position , " Lieberman says . <p> Show time . The only certainty is that an impeachment trial would be a spectacle . Chief Justice William Rehnquist would preside ; the 100 senators would sit in silent judgment . House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde  --  or a surrogate  --  would serve as prosecutor , and the president would designate an attorney to represent him . Only the judge , prosecutor , and defense lawyers could question witnesses , who would face the jury of senators . The " jurors " could submit written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote counters in the House say the only articles that have a shot at making it across the Hill are those charging that the president lied under oath to the grand jury and during the civil deposition . But only two witnesses could confirm those allegations : the president and Monica Lewinsky . That means " we wo n't have many witnesses , if any at all , " says a senior Republican Senate aide . " Members are not going to be excited about quibbling over the details , and the White House does n't want Monica Lewinsky sitting there as a witness . " <p> Should the House impeach , the articles would be immediately referred to the secretary of the Senate . But the trial might be weeks in developing . Senate rules call for members to continue the trial uninterrupted , Monday through Saturday , until conclusion . The Senate could conduct legislative business only before the trial started and after it recessed for the day . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Unpredictable .
