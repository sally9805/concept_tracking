MOST OF US WOULD NEED TWO LIFETIMES TO ACQUIRE THE FISHING KNOWLEDGE THAT OUTDOOR LIFE WRITER AND EDITOR JOE BROOKS AMASSED IN HIS 71 YEARS . LIKE THE BEST ATHLETES AND SCIENTISTS , HE WAS GIFTED WITH A KIND OF AUTOMATIC LEARNING THAT TOOK EXPERIENCE AND CONVERTED IT INTO INTELLIGENCE AND PRACTICE . THIS ARTICLE , WRITTEN IN 1963 ABOUT THE MUDDLER MINNOW 'S VERSATILITY AND OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS , IS CLASSIC JOE BROOKS . Three times I had changed flies , hoping to find the one that would be irresistible , and three times that thing out there had come up , given those right-looking offerings the once-over , and faded downward again , slowly . This was one of the biggest trout I had ever seen , and he was refusing what I considered my choicest flies . Then I wondered why I had n't put on a Muddler to begin with . Photograph Photograph // It was late September on the Big Hole River in Montana . The day was cold , bright and windless . The pool I was fishing was still too , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a No. 10 hook . That size would n't stir the pool enough to look unnatural . On the first cast , I saw a shadow under the Muddler as it floated over the trout 's position . Then , as the fly drifted a couple of feet more , the shadow moved higher . I gently pulled the fly under , and it continued along half an inch beneath the surface . That shadow grew and then struck , the whole length of the fish showing as his back broke into the air . When the hook sank home , the heavy-shouldered brownie went berserk . He thrashed on top , sent out rolling waves and then came halfway out , showing the whites of his eyes and a mouthful of teeth . Then he nicked the 4X tippet and disappeared . When I discovered he 'd carried away my only Muddler , I felt worse than I did about losing the fish . Here I was with two full days of fishing the Big Hole ahead of me , and my last Muddler was gone . Ever since that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizes , from No. 10 all the way up to 1/0 , because , over the past 13 years or so , I have found that the Muddler is the best all-around fly of its kind I have ever used . It 's a great fly at any time , but it reaches its peak of effectiveness in the fall , during late September and throughout October when big fish are feeding heavily to store up fat for the winter . Cooler water keeps these busters inactive during the early morning , but during midday and right up to dark they hit the Muddler as if it were a mortal enemy . The original Muddler was tied by Don Gapen of Orillia , Ontario . At the time , Don was fishing the Nipigon River in northwestern Ontario , a river that has produced some of the greatest eastern brook-trout fishing anywhere . One evening , as members of his fishing party were settling by the campfire , Don noticed several of their Ojibwa guides slipping off into the shadows down by the river , each armed with a table fork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cached down there , Don followed them . " Why the fork ? " he asked the first guide he came upon . " Watch , " the Ojibwa replied . He stripped a piece of birch bark off a nearby tree , moved down to the water 's edge and put a match to the bark . It flared up brightly , and farther downstream , Don could see similar torches burning . " You hold it , " said the guide , handing Don the flaming brand . Then he quickly reached down into the water about six inches deep at the shore , and lifted a flat rock . Suddenly he jabbed down hard with the fork then raised it to show Don a minnow impaled on the prongs . The little fish had a flattened head , a tapered body , big pectoral fins . Don recognized it . " What do you want darters for ? " he asked . " Cocatouse minnow , " the guide replied . " Big trout like it best . " " Give me that one , " said Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly to match it . " He took the small fish to camp and by the light of a gas lantern tied the first Muddler Minnow : spun deer hair , gray squirrel wing and turkey wing tail . Knowing that there were already flies bearing the names " Cocatouse " and " Darter , " Don chose the name Muddler Minnow for his creation because this local appellation occurs a number of times in the scientific description of the sculpin family to which the cocatouse belongs . To test its qualities in various sizes , Don tied the pattern on hooks from No. 12 all the way to 1/0 . He fished the smaller sizes as he would a dry fly , the larger ones like a bucktail or streamer-thrown across the current and then retrieved in slow , foot-long strokes , or in a series of short , fast jerks . In eddies , such as the one just below the Nipigon Bridge , he would let the fly float till the water grabbed and drowned the floating line so the fly drifted around and around with the eddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the Muddler in use was right in that eddy . Don cast one out on a No. 2 hook . The current caught it and carried it shoreward ; then the eddy snatched it under . Don held the rod steady as the line was pulled down into the swirling water . He let it drift around for three or four minutes , but nothing touched the Muddler . " Guess they 're not hungry right now , " Don said . " Maybe there are no trout there today , " I suggested . " Trout are always there , " he answered , and as if to prove his words , his rod tip was yanked down and he was into something good . When he finally brought it up to our feet , 10 minutes later , it turned out to be a 5 1/2-pound brookie . I began to fish a Muddler right then . Yet , when Don first tried to put the Muddler on the market , it did n't sell . " No color , " the dealers told him . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fly is drab . " When finally a Pennsylvania company began to tie the fly commercially , it sold only to a few fishermen who recognized in it some of the elements of greatness  --  the squirrel tail , which is tops in fly tying , and the turkey feather wing which is used in so many great flies , such as the Montreal , Joe 's Hopper , March Brown and Seth Gordon . But gradually those anglers who discovered its merits carried the Muddler all over the country , and everywhere the story was the same . The Muddler was a big fish getter and a sure fish getter . For , though tied to ape the cocatouse minnow , it had the knack of looking like many different items on the trout menu . In large sizes it could look like a mouse . Again , it might look like a grasshopper . And still again , the medium sizes can seem to be a stonefly with wings folded flat . Small-sized Muddlers , floated dry or pulled under and fished wet , seem just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a dry fly to a nymph . And in the right spots , any Muddler looks like a minnow . There are many variations of the still float , and most are applicable to the Muddler . It can be cast up-and  --  across stream , allowed to float motionless for a few feet , and then given a couple of slow , foot-long jerks and permitted to float free again . Then , when the fly is coming across current at the end of the float , a couple of six  --  inch jerks , speeding it up a bit , will often bring a hit . Such a retrieve pulls trout out of hiding places under the far bank and from feeding stations on either side of the current . Often they are big fish . Fishing the Muddler dry seems to pay off best just at dusk , but of course this could be true of almost any fly , because that is the time when fish are most active and are feeding avidly on the usually thick natural fly life found at that time of day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death in 1972 , first wrote for OL in 1951. // Because it resembles so many things on which fish feed , and because of the many ways it can be handled , the Muddler is good in almost any sweet water . Brown trout , rainbows , brooks and cutthroats all go for it . Landlocked salmon like it . European sea trout , a seagoing version of the brown trout , fall all over it . And on my first cast with a Muddler into an Icelandic salmon river , a 12-pound Atlantic salmon hit with a thump . After that , in rivers in Iceland , Norway , Ireland , Scotland and England , a series of salmon from 8 to 25 pounds showed a decided preference for the Muddler . In the British Isles alone , I landed more than half my salmon on this fly , as against the classic Atlantic salmon ties such as the Jock Scott , Silver Doctor , Black Doctor , Thunder and Lightning and others . The Pacific Coast silver salmon will also hit a Muddler . One day I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mont . I was in a boat with Lee Elliott , owner of Rock Creek Lodge in Clinton , Mont. , and Ray Denton , owner of the camp out of which we were fishing . Dan Bailey , one of the country 's leading fly tiers , and Red Monical , Dan 's partner in a fly shop in Livingston , Mont. , were in a boat 100 feet from us . Dan made a cast with a No. 10 Muddler and had a thumping hit , and a big , silvery fish came sailing out into the air . He finally got the fish boatside , a five-pound silver salmon . Dan was already an enthusiastic Muddler fan for trout , but that catch really convinced him of the fly 's versatility . And soon after that Red became a confirmed Muddler man when , in Rock Creek , after many years of fishing , he caught his first five-pound trout ... on a Muddler . Yet , like every fly pattern that is new to a certain territory , the Muddler ran into the familiar statement , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't work here . We have a fly that 's unbeatable on our river . " But the Muddler has proved itself over all such objections , on stream after stream , and when local fishermen have seen the Muddler taking fish when their pet flies were unsuccessful , they began to think . The result has been a rash of close copies . Each tier has added a little something of his own , perhaps changed the color of the wing or the body a little , and then has cheerfully sung its praises . He has transformed the pattern of the Muddler into a fish-taker on his stream as in the Muddler family photograph , page 60 . Of course , these variations are still the Muddler , essentially , and as such take fish in the East , West , North and South . But the original Muddler Minnow , as tied by Don Gapen , remains the best pattern . The only adaptation I 've seen that comes close is the White Muddler . One day Dan Bailey was fishing a Muddler , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies and their adaptations . He remembered the Bumble Puppy that Theodore Gordon used so long ago specifically for big trout . Just as an experiment , Dan took the basic Muddler and crossed it with the Bumble Puppy , and the White Muddler was born . Bailey used white deer hair , white calf hair and white wool . V.T. Hamlin , creator of the Alley Oop comic strip , used the White Muddler in Montana with such success that he wrote it into one of his drawings . The strip that ran on Wednesday , October 24,1956 , shows a leaping trout , and hanging from its mouth is a big White Muddler , labeled by Hamlin the " Missoulian Spook " because he used the fly first while fishing near Missoula , Mont . The name caught on like wildfire , as did the fly itself , and today every trout fisherman in the West swears by the Missoulian Spook . But Dan Bailey , like myself , still rates the original Muddler Minnow as tops . " The Missoulian Spook , or White Muddler , is terrific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " I 'd place the Muddler Minnow among the first five of all-time great patterns for trout flies . " I heartily agree .
