1 BUGSY <P> American Dreaming by the gangster Bugsy Siegel , who , besides inventing himself as a Hollywood celebrity , invented Las Vegas as the playground for our more primitive fantasies . Warren Beatty and Annette Bening are terrific in director Barry Levinson 's smart-ironic , romantic-perverse , funny-poignant take on modern life in a fast , deadly lane . <P> 2 . MY FATHER 'S GLORY/MY MOTHER 'S CASTLE <P> In a radiant two-part adaptation of Marcel Pagnol 's autobiography , French writer-director Yves Robert imagines family life in Provence as a storybook dream : loving parents , adventurous but obedient children , an idyllic refuge every summer . This old-men 's view of youth tells us that memories are precious because life is short . <P> 3 . EUROPA , EUROPA <P> In World War II Germany , a Jewish adolescent survives by becoming a member of the Hitler Youth . Writer-director Agnieszka Holland based her miraculously jaunty , profoundly moving portrayal of the will to live on the true story of one Solomon Perel . And Marco Hofschneider plays him with a stunned guile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the political savants who have been denouncing this zippy melodrama had n't already existed , Oliver Stone might have invented them , because they fulfill his one-size-fits-all conspiracy theory . Hyper down , pundits ! Do n't deny Stone the right due any artist : to interpret history through his own prism . And give moviegoers the chance to make up their own minds about who shot President Kennedy . The only thing that Stone 's dazzling assemblage of political-science fiction attempts to assassinate is complacency . <P> 5 . BLACK ROBE <P> A Jesuit priest goes into the 17th century Canadian wilderness to convert the savages and is himself converted , after terrifying adventures , to cultural relativism . Bruce Beresford 's dark dance with the wolves of the spirit is an intelligent , perfectly controlled epic . <P> 6 . PARIS IS BURNING <P> At the Harlem drag balls , gents parade in costumes and personalities of their own baroque creation . Jennie Livingston 's thrilling documentary is not just about what it means to be a member of the triple minority of gay black transvestites . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overwhelming  --  that all dreamers have for transcendence . <P> 7 . THELMA &; LOUISE <P> Road picture , feminist parable and populist comedy , this tale of two ladies looking for adventure and getting more than they bargained for outraged the humor-handicapped , but dug into the ribs of the ribald . In the title roles , Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon were gloriously wiggy . <P> 8 . BEAUTY AND THE BEAST <P> There 's plenty of animation dazzle in Disney 's latest tuneful fable ; the Be Our Guest number manages to evoke both Busby Berkeley and the Folies-Bergere . But Beauty swaps the buoyancy of Disney 's last great cartoon feature , The Little Mermaid , for poignancy and emotional depth . That 's fine too since , at heart , this story is about a man 's need to evoke fear when he is really afraid , and a woman 's need to pity a man before she can love him . <P> 9 .
