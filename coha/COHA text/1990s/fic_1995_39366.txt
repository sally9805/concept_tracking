In the bottom of the deep silver sugar spoon are seventy holes forming five petals in a stylized rose . Through this flower , Severin Hansen sprinkles oblivion over a bowl of strawberries every morning , and in the winter over his hot porridge . <p> He wakes at five to sunshine through the green window blinds , to warmth and birds singing  --  or he wakes at five because the darkness is squeezing in around the house , around the solitary man 's childhood dreams ; and he continues to lie there for half an hour , eyes closed , to free himself of his forgotten feelings . Then he goes into the utility room , washes himself , puts on a clean blue shirt , and tears the previous day from the kitchen calendar . <p> The street and the city farther up the fjord are still sleeping when he opens the door to his shop , looks at the thermometer , empties the mailbox from yesterday  --  postal remittance card , overdue bills , printed matter  --  and puts it all in a box under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boils a kettle of water , scalds the bowl and spoon , wipes them both clean , goes out into the garden behind the house , picks a bowl of dark red berries , through which the thin layer of refined sugar soon sinks to the bottom . The new day finds its way into his body through his taste buds . The sun and the shadows from the chestnut tree move closer . Flies buzz in the warmth . The young neighbors across the way throw open their window and turn on their radio with a blast of distortion . <p> Severin Hansen again considers seeking one of them out and casually offering to repair the speaker . A minor defect in the coil produces this grating sound , which seems not to bother them . It is n't really the sound itself that irritates him either . His problem is the defect in the fine instrument . This is why he sits in a molded plastic chair eating his berries instead of using one of the hundreds of chairs he has designed and made or repaired over the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wildlife out to the workshop with him and pulls the telephone jack out when Minna Mikkelsen and his customers begin to call . <p> Every day is almost exactly the same  --  and therefore surprisingly different right down to the essence of events . Severin Hansen intentionally tries to follow his timetable in order to be able to read off the events that flow toward him openly and clearly , and so to figure out what the day is all about . <p> " Arboreal marsupials are tree-dwelling animals , many of which never touch the ground throughout their lives . This holds true , for example , for the five-inch-long pouched dormouse and the vulpine opossum . Their eyes are developed for night vision and their prehensile tails also function in part as a rudder for their jumps from branch to branch . " <p> Before Severin has been able to study the beautiful photographs of the koalas  --  which eat only one kind of food , eucalyptus leaves  --  Minna Mikkelsen is standing in the shop . He puts the book down with a sigh and asks what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sick . You 're not answering your phone . I 've got to hurry to work . " <p> " How long has your husband been dead , Minna ? " Severin asks and begins to adjust his plane , wood chisel , and turning tool . He sharpens and polishes and tests them with the sensitive fleshy part of his finger . <p> " Twelve years . And you know that perfectly well . So why do you ask ? " <p> " Sometimes I still miss him . " <p> " Of course . I guess we all do . Why are you saying this right now ? Nobody can figure you out , Severin . " <p> " There 's nothing to figure out . Do n't let it bother you . You 're making too big a thing out of it . I assure you . " <p> " You promised to go to the movies with me last night . " <p> " Maybe , I said . " <p> " Maybe , maybe , maybe . " <p> " Unnecessary plans spoil life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " No plans , no progress , " Minna says , as she said it a hundred times when she was engaged to Severin Hansen more than twenty-five years ago , as she said it when she broke the engagement and now in the time that has passed since . <p> " Do you believe that yourself ? " Severin Hansen says as usual and places the business manager 's buffet door on two sawhorses by the windows . " You live in a vacuum , Minna . You ignore reality and hold on to those fantasies that are necessary if your plans are to have any meaning . You carve away 99 percent of your life for the benefit of good stories about your shallow life . " <p> Minna looks down at her nice black summer dress with its small bouquets of violet roses . It is tight . Earlier that morning , she could wear it . Now it looks like a hollow reed . <p> " You missed a good movie , " she says . <p> " The possibilities are endless . That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last chance to see that movie . I wasted four evenings waiting for you because I thought you should see it . " <p> " Now you see what happens to all your preparations for the future . They cost a lot . When do you have to be at work , anyway ? " <p> The buffet door is as good as the day it was carved by Michel Pedersen Holm 135 years ago . It 's not the first time Severin has had the pleasure of seeing the gracefully sweeping pencil signature behind the twining succulent foliage , fresh and fragrant until an overtired child got its mother 's attention by hammering a toy against Pedersen Holm 's lines and cuts , so the brilliant ideas , stalks and stamens cracked and snapped off the veins of the old oak . <p> The child 's mother screams in shock , finally seeing the flora in her living room and remembers Severin Hansen . <p> " You see , it 's all the same to him , " her neighbor says . " He can still remove all the damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother rushes through the town towards Severin 's house , driving , then running , leaping , turning into many wrong alleys where she tells her story , adding to it or subtracting from it , a little here , a little there . Previously , that piece of furniture just stood in the living room like any other piece . The incident makes her forget the unchanging contents of everyday life and fling her arms around the neck of the town . <p> She almost does n't notice  --  or notices only too late  --  that Severin gingerly squirms from her grasp . He does n't hear her outburst as he goes ahead of her into his workshop with the buffet door . <p> His fingers run along a serrated leaf , Pedersen Holm 's special sign , which leads inward , into the stem of the leaf and the strands . <p> " She 's usually not a bad child , " the woman insists . " She can already sit still for hours with a picture book , and then this ... " <p> " Forget it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be standing there again . Pedersen Holm has a very special way of following or cutting the veins . " <p> " Who ? " <p> Severin turns the cupboard door over and shows her the inscription . <p> " All the more reason why Marlene should n't have ... " <p> " Pick it up in a week . All right ? " <p> It is easy to repair the master 's work . The natural and self-assured lines almost recreate themselves under Severin 's expert hand . <p> Afterward , he moves effortlessly from the repair bench to the lathe , where unexpected lines entice him , emerging . <p> He sweats , opens the window , hears the summer rain , and realizes he is hungry . <p> It 's close to two o'clock . The mailman comes into the workshop hoping for a bottle of beer or cup of coffee , though he does n't say so . <p> " Did you empty your mailbox ? " <p> " You know I empty it in the morning before the new mail comes . That suits me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The letters stop shouting . They just whisper . Sometimes the writing is faded . " <p> " You should straighten out your finances . It 'll get too expensive for you this way . I 'm telling you this for your own good . " <p> " Yes . I should collect what 's owed me . I have n't had the time . This month , though . I do n't have a beer in the house . " <p> " Does n't matter anyway , " the mailman says . " The rain is letting up . There are more bills for you today . Pick them up and get it over with . " <p> " Not today , " Severin says angrily . <p> " Excuse me ! " <p> " They wo n't go anywhere . In fact , I think I ' 11 wait until Sunday . " The mailman opens the door , steps outside . <p> " I do n't think that 's even legal , " he says . " Mailboxes have to be emptied every day . " <p> Severin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks into the kitchen does he remember there is practically nothing to eat . He has to force himself to eat the margarine , the last of the bread , and the two anchovies . The meal fortifies him for his afternoon walk in the quarter-acre garden , where several trees planted during Michel Pedersen Holm 's time still bear fruit at every harvest . <p> It has been years since he stopped throwing back the trash the neighbor dumps into the embankment or into Severin 's mother 's and grandmother 's rose beds  --  even since he stopped seeing it or noticing the water-filled condoms hung in the apple tree as a prank by schoolgirls . When he stops reacting to a problem , it no longer exists . Best to avoid the sudden , violent reactions of youth , which are just plain dangerous for a mature man . <p> The teasing that stirs people up only rarely has any serious meaning : injured vanity , insults . What 's that ? Severin Hansen is , after all , a nice middle-aged man with acceptable blood pressure , reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear , good teeth , gray hair , diminished muscle capacity , who makes a curious impression on young people and exercises a certain attraction over certain more elderly people . <p> What could be better than that ? <p> Severin Hansen waves to his neighbor behind the bushes . <p> " Going to be a great year for plums , " he says . <p> " They need to be thinned out , " the neighbor says . " Otherwise it will affect the tree . " <p> " Affect it ? " <p> " Inhibit the growth , of course . I 've thinned my fruit trees . " <p> " I do n't care how tall my trees are , " Severin answers . <p> " Are you kidding ? " <p> The neighbor 's unexpected agitation startles Severin Hansen , who takes his words back and promises to thin the fruit out soon . <p> Meanwhile , the clouds over the town have broken up . The sun shines on the house and the workshop annex , whose back door can be opened and latched to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorstep and read about the twenty-two-foot amethyst-colored python , about " the children 's python " that is kept almost like a rat- and rabbit-hunting house pet , about the fighting snakes , the small poisonous snake , Demansia , whose " males coil firmly around each other to wring their opponent 's life from its body . Squeezing and being squeezed in the mutual stranglehold , they each believe , for one moment , they are capable of performing feats of supernatural strength , a divine , one-time strength that will kill the enemy . " But they slide down from the pinnacle of the moment as if from a slimy rock . Their strength meets , combines , and weakens at the same tempo , and very quickly . The body does n't obey the will . It almost seems to obey the enemy 's will , loosening its grip precisely as the enemy loosens its own . <p> This happens . Not even the last wild  --  and humble  --  wish about sloughing off the skin now comes true : just to crawl out of the husk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrapped up in the empty hull and a foolish fantasy : " I have won , I have killed him . " They both have to stay and feel their strength diminish and turn to nothing . They stay and lose and squeeze , until the enemy 's grip feels like a mere trickle in the sand , and each slithers a few yards away and hides in the ground . <p> The church bell strikes six . The wind and summer light still stream into the workshop , the sound of a power saw , a moped , cars . <p> Severin picks another bowl of strawberries , sits down at the kitchen table , sprinkles sugar . <p> Eleven flagstones lead from the back door of the workshop around the corner of the house to the locked plank door of the narrower addition . <p> The cement room has only two small windows that face north and that stare , like a pair of cold eyes , at the ivy-covered wall of the closed bakery . Therefore , Severin Hansen takes an old jacket from the coat rack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulb in the ceiling . The burner with its container , distillation chamber , overflow pipe , and steam tap is just the way he left it more than six months ago . Nevertheless , he subjects it all to a complete inspection : Do the pipe-threads fit tightly ? Are the pipes and taps completely clean ? <p> He bought these parts over twenty years ago from an old electrician in Odense . They are works of art in and of themselves and work like the day the old man bought them , constructed the apparatus and laid some solid chunks of wood in the stove that burned so well the fire could be controlled like the main puppet in a marionette theater . With the help of a grate and a damper , the old man could regulate the temperature up or down to his liking  --  degree by degree . The steam would settle like milk in the first pipe . <p> Severin knows the glass 's thinnest point and blister and knows in advance that he wo n't find any brittleness this time either . Going over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquility to think over the antique dealer ' s death and ignore the ringing of the telephone inside the house . <p> The young man  --  only thirty-two years old  --  opened his shop when he was twenty-five . It was his childish wife 's idea , but she got tired of both the shop and her husband before even the initial problems were overcome . In return , Benny Helmer found consolation , later a meaning , in building and improving and constantly embellishing his domain on a respectable street . As time went on , he thought he found bits of his beautiful wife 's soul in the countless stories of the porcelain , glass , and woodwork , and ended up one winter at Severin Hansen 's door seeking to remedy a flaw in a sewing box from 1781 . <p> The job was a challenge . Before the tortoiseshell butterfly was carved in the black oak , Benny Helmer and Severin Hansen had drunk many cases of beer in the workshop . During their conversations , they had sewn pearls on silk and silk on velvet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding the box . Severin Hansen came a long way . The pupa unfolded itself , its antennae stretched from its forehead , the skin of its wings tightened , hardened , became frosted with dust . The butterfly could have flown . <p> Benny came with other flaws , nicks , scratches . <p> " I 'm sure you can restore this little picture here , Severin . " <p> " No , I ca n't . " <p> " Yes , you can , " said Minna . " Of course . " <p> The idea seized Severin . He tried . He repaired faience , stoneware , old clocks . <p> Benny came the day he had the big scene with his brother . He came with financial problems that were turned inside out in the workshop and put in place in their entirety , well before the deadlines of the registered letters , their blanks filled in with collection fees . He came the day he was able to put a name to his illness , the day he had given up all hope that the doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night after a bad dream , fleeing death , pounding wildly on Severin 's wall , door , windows . <p> " Open up , Severin . Now . " <p> And the already cadaverous young man looked at him with large eyes , jaws , and teeth , embraced him and held him tightly with supernatural strength . He did n't let go even when Severin , confused and drunk with sleep , tumbled backwards down the hall , on into the living room , where his grasp became even firmer and his hands softer . Severin was paralyzed with fantasies about what was going to happen . Benny Helmer begged and pleaded . <p> We 'll be able to see each other again tomorrow , Severin thought . The day after tomorrow he 'll be dead . <p> For a few moments , the wild hope of slipping free drove Benny into another kind of agitation that made him overcome the heterosexual limitations on both of them , but close to the climax , it grew cold and empty . <p> For Severin Hansen it was all as cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was confirmed one freezing day in April  --  in the absence of God . He had stood below the altar staring at the colorful altarpiece without seeing it  --  knowing only that it would be even more horrifying to turn around to the gifts and flowers . <p> Both before and afterward , Severin Hansen was bound to the moment when he could free himself from the sick man 's powerless limbs , straighten his nightshirt and turn on the light with a push of the brown button , whose click he heard and felt through his finger every winter day many more times than he was aware of . <p> He pushed the button and looked at the face of the clock : quarter past four . The night 's darkest hour lay outside the yellowed window blinds . He picked the old sofa pillow up off the floor and remembered to lay it down with the patch underneath . <p> Benny Helmer was lying motionless with one foot under the linen chest as if he were dead . <p> " You are n't going to die tonight  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put water on for coffee . <p> The white bread and jam turned Benny into a baby , watched over and tended for four hours by Severin Hansen , who went out to his workshop at nine o'clock to give his guest the opportunity to leave without having to explain anything . <p> Later , they acted as if nothing had happened . Out of gratitude , Severin Hansen made the young man believe that he too was suffering from Benny 's fatal illness . Now they could talk about the pain on an equal footing . Their brotherhood was ideal . It was hermetic . <p> When Benny died , Severin felt sick and feeble and incapable of getting out of bed . Through his fog of incapacity , he heard Minna knocking at the windows . He heard her pleas and threats , and he received the doctor she sent , and who ascertained that the young man 's suffering had been buried with him . <p> Severin turns on the gas and lights up the fire under the container . For a few minutes , the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Severin hears a bird scratching on the roof . Then the steam begins to rise in the clear pipe , stopping short of the top and trickling down its walls . After a few more minutes , alcohol is dripping down into one of the collectors like fine raindrops . It sits on the bottom in glistening beads in which the container , the apparatus by its side , Severin Hansen 's distorted face are all reflected . <p> Through the walls he hears Minna put her bike in the rack around by the shop door , knock on the windowpane , knock on the front door next to it , walk around the house , open the workshop door and call him . " Severin , where are you ? " <p> She listens . <p> " Are you here , Severin ? " <p> She steps inside the workshop , wants to go farther toward the door to his living quarters , but realizes where he is . So she retreats quickly along the walls , around the house . <p> The water level sinks slowly in the distillation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a big seashell , condenses , trickles along the coiled pipe through the cooling water , drips . <p> Severin thinks about all the people he has known and for inscrutable reasons lingers on some of them . Always different ones than last time . Sometimes minor characters , sometimes main characters . Short meetings , superficial remarks , sometimes key words , deeper relations . <p> Nacreous , the distillate drips down onto the smooth surface of the alcohol , glimmers briefly and sinks to the bottom . <p> Severin Hansen hangs his jacket back on the peg among the other old jackets , pulls the upholstered stool out from the corner , polishes his tasting glass , and opens the tap . <p> The first drops cleanse his tongue and taste buds and make room for the experiences that follow , while the sun shines on the bright ivy leaves outside the windows . The liquid rushes down his throat and into his blood . <p> Severin Hansen listens to another , lighter and more fluid voice in his head and opens the floodgate . He speaks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiny buttons on his jacket , listens and still takes an interest in space travel . <p> " The day they landed on the moon , I was in Ribe , Leo . Yes , Leo , right there in Ribe . " <p> The imaginary listener 's ear grows . The auricle is downy and snow white , the ear canal dark and bottomless . <p> Leo was always smiling , but why ? <p> " Sputnik was the greatest , right ? You 'll have to forgive your father . We all will when we 've been through the same thing . That 's how it is , you know . And it 's good enough anyway . " <p> " Yeah , you 're right . But landing on the moon was the greatest . " <p> The listener gathers strength , while Severin Hansen becomes increasingly insubstantial  --  cotton-candy Hansen in tender anesthetizing vapors . <p> " I 'm humoring you because I think that you still have some of your childhood confidence . You know where you are in a world that progress has moved on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Leo . You believe in me after all . You see me clearly before you . You see my skull , which surrounds the soft brain matter . You see my back , tiny and young as you are , Leo . You see me from behind and know something about me that I have never really understood . You see me go away and come back . If I knew what you know , I would have a god in me . <p> " Sorry I never really noticed you , Leo . " <p> Translated by Jeanne Griffin <p> Born in 1947 on a farm on the Danish island of Samso ( also the home of the celebrated Danish poet Thorkild Bjornvig ) , Vibeke Gronfeldt made her literary debut in 1976 with the novel Din tavshed er min skrift pa vaeggen ( Your Silence is My Writing on the Wall ) but now identifies her first three books as fledgling work . The selection presented here is from her tenth book , Dodningeuret ( The Deathwatch Beetle , 1990 which was nominated for the literature prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gronfeldt says , " The book has only one voice , that of the carpenter Severin Hansen , who is in a constant dialogue with himself in his indefatigable quest to understand his fellow beings , including the deathwatch beetle , a pest that works in the same wood as he . Severin Hansen is a modern man . He has no money , no calendar , and no preconceived ideas because he knows that the past and present are a blend that each person sees from his or her own viewpoint . His own past tells him that nothing can be taken for granted . Every day begins anew with an attempt to understand . Many people come to him , and his door is always open but primarily he shares his days with the silence of the house in which he dwells with the deathwatch beetle , ticking in the wood of the antique furniture he seeks to restore . " Gronfeldt 's prose is not experimental but functional , a simple conveyance for straighfforward stories of human beings with no avant-garde concerns about the theoretical nature of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function of its content . A good story , like a chair or a table , comprises its own form as a direct extension of its function . <p> Vibeke Gronfeldt 's other novels include Det fantastiske barn ( The Fantastic Child , 1982 ) , Tidens tilbud ( The Offer of Time , 1983 ) , Den blanke sol ( The Blank Sun 1985 ) , Stenbillede ( Stone Picture , 1986 ) , Mulighedernes ( The Land of Possibilities , 1989 ) , Mekanik ( Mechanical Things , 1992 ) , and Opdagelsen ( Discovery , 1993 ) .
