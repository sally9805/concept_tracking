Even before Paul Tsongas quit the show last week , an aide to Bill Clinton described the front runner 's new focus in three words : " Bush , Bush , Bush . " Clinton believes that a successful presidential candidate must view the primary- and general-election campaigns as a single play in two acts rather than as two one-act dramas ; the sooner one can articulate the general campaign 's themes the better . So if the schedule holds  --  and perhaps as early as this week  --  the nominee-presumptive will deliver a major foreign policy address . <P> Why foreign affairs and why now ? With the anemic economy showing signs of recovery , Clinton knows that in the fall Bush will be playing his strongest card and that even in a world of reduced threats Clinton must pass the threshold test : Can Americans trust him as Commander in Chief ? Better , then , to lay some markers down early , especially when his critique and prescriptions are essentially centrist . There is also the possibility for an elegant piece of what Mario Cuomo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunder in an area he is perceived as owning . <P> To accomplish this trick , the probable centerpiece of Clinton 's speech will involve how and to what extent the U.S. should aid the former Soviet Union . Stung by Pat Buchanan 's isolationist attacks and the common criticism that he has spent too much time on foreign affairs , Bush has virtually ignored the issue . In pleading poverty ( " There is n't a lot of money around . . . I do n't have a blank check " ) and refusing to heed Richard Nixon 's warnings about chaos and a return to dictatorship in the Commonwealth of Independent States , Bush has offered Clinton a window of opportunity . ( If it closes , if Bush jumps out with his own ideas for C.I.S . assistance before Clinton can , the candidate will shift his emphasis . ) <P> Clinton is already on record as favoring a sizable C.I.S . aid program , so his upcoming remarks will represent an elaboration rather than an expedient first-time treatment of the issue . " We should spend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help the C.I.S . dismantle its nuclear weapons and to help the republics convert to a marketable currency and a market economy , " Clinton said several months ago . " Spending now will save us billions in lower defense costs forever and will within five or so years increase trade opportunities dramatically . "
