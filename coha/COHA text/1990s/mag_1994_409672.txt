Even in the annals of children killing children , to which new chapters are being added with depressing regularity , it was somehow uniquely disturbing . To the very end , Janie Fields could n't bring herself to believe what people were saying about her 11-year-old grandson Robert " Yummy " Sandifer . Standing on the front porch of her small frame house in south Chicago 's tough Roseland neighborhood , Fields insisted that Yummy  --  so-called for his love of cookies  --  was not the minimonster being described by the police and the press . As she told it , the wiry 4 ' ' 8 " youngster liked to tinker with his bike and stereo and was devoted to his two dogs , a bloodhound named Lady Long Ears and his Chihuahua , Piccolo . " He 's a nice kid , " said Fields , still clinging to the present tense , " until he gets with the wrong group . " The trouble was , in all his short life he was never far from those wrong groups  --  the drug gangs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Aug. 28 , while perhaps tending to unspecified gang business , Sandifer opened fire with a semiautomatic pistol in his neighborhood and accidentally killed Shavon Dean , 14 , a cheery high school freshman who had hoped to become a beautician . One of three children , Shavon was acquainted with Sandifer , but was not friendly with him . The tragedy came full circle three days later when Sandifer , whose bedroom was decorated with posters of typical teen icons like Michael Jordan , as well as gang slogans , was himself found shot to death under a desolate railroad viaduct , evidently executed so that he could not implicate his cohorts . In retrospect , perhaps no one should have been surprised by what happened . Robert 's prospects had never been bright . His mother , Lorina Sandifer , now 29 , who has a history of drug abuse and at least 30 misdemeanor arrests , had her first child when she was 15 . Robert , whose father , Robert Akins , is serving time in Wisconsin on drug charges , was the third of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his siblings to come to the attention of child welfare authorities . Before he was 3 , after social workers had investigated the family on three separate occasions , Robert , his two brothers and one sister were taken from their mother on the grounds of cruelty and severe neglect . ( Authorities were unsure who had inflicted the physical abuse . ) " When Robert came into the system he had cigarette burns on his butt , his neck , his arm , and linear marks all over his body  --  where he 'd been beaten with an electrical cord , " says Patrick Murphy , Cook County public guardian since 1978 . " Neighbors claimed that his 5-1/2-year-old brother was watching the kids 12 hours a day while the mom was off . " The court awarded legal guardianship to the children 's grandmother Janie Fields , then in her mid-30s . Soon , though , Fields was overwhelmed by the task of controlling the kids . ( At various times the household contained as many as 19 children . ) Robert stopped going to school regularly when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Roseland , which for all its poverty and crime is far from the most blighted of Chicago 's inner-city neighborhoods . " He was an ordinary kid , no trouble to me , " says Danny Prear , his coach at the public pool where he was on the swimming team . But others who knew him say he was becoming deeply involved in serious crime . " Yummy was bad , bad , bad , " says Shshana Simmons , a friend of Shavon 's . " He broke into people 's houses and stole cars . " At some point he became an apprentice thug with a drug gang called the Black Disciples . In 1993 child welfare workers once again intervened , this time moving Sandifer and his siblings to a state-run shelter . Assistant public guardian Ann O'Callaghan recalls her shock last year when she first encountered Robert . " I 'd heard that he was heavily into the gang structure , " says O'Callaghan , " and here was this little kid with his brother , and they were wearing these little matching brown outfits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert had become . Last November he and one of his brothers were sent to Lawrence Hall , a residential center for troubled boys on Chicago 's north side . He soon ran away from Lawrence Hall and never returned . In February , Robert pleaded guilty to attempted armed robbery and was sentenced to two years probation . With that the youth services system essentially ran out of options for him . " There are no secure facilities in the state for these violent kids , " says county guardian Murphy . " And it takes from six months to two years to get an out-of-state placement . " But as Murphy sees it , the truly heartbreaking fact is that there was little that could be done . " By age 3 , Robert was a sociopath , " says Murphy . " With a ton of intervention  --  three or four years in a great facility  --  we might have made him into a nonviolent sociopath . " Instead , he was arrested in June on a stolen-car charge and in August on a burglary rap . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of it  --  authorities were helpless to take any meaningful steps to halt his slide . He was too young to be held in jail or held with older , hardened juveniles , but too dangerous himself to be placed with young offenders . On the evening of Aug. 28 , Sandifer began his final spree by shooting a neighborhood student , Kianta Britten , 15 . " Kianta was coming down the street , and Yummy asked him what gang he was related to , " says Britten 's mother , Patricia . " Kianta said he was n't in a gang , and Yummy pulled out a gun . " Sandifer 's first shots missed Britten , but the next two struck , one hitting him in the stomach , another catching a nerve , which has left him partially paralyzed . Two hours later , Sandifer opened fire on a nearby group of boys playing football , some of whom were believed to be rival gang members . At that moment , Shavon was walking to a friend 's house munching corn chips from a bag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head by a stray bullet . In the three days after the killing , as police combed the city for him , Robert was given refuge by the Black Disciples . On Aug. 31 , according to investigators , he was sitting on a neighbor 's porch , apparently waiting for his grandmother to pick him up . At that point , say authorities , two alleged fellow gang members , Cragg Hardaway , 16 , and his younger brother , led him to their car . According to police , the younger brother , whose name is being withheld because of his age , later told them that Cragg had taken Robert into the underpass . The brother said he heard three shots , and that Cragg came back to the car saying , " It 's done . " Cragg reportedly insisted that he had merely handed Robert over to another youth at the viaduct . In any case , shortly after midnight Robert 's body was found , his head in a pool of blood , dirt and glass . At his funeral last week , friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life wasted . But ultimately there was really only sadness , an emotion well suited to a world where children carry guns and adults carry their a coffins . " Something very , very wrong is happening ; everyone is trying to grapple with why , " says Patrick Murphy softly . " I suppose there are a million reasons . " <p>
