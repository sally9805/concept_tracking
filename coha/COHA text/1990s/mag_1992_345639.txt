The opening and closing images in Crazy for You , a " new " Gershwin brothers musical that opened on Broadway last week , depict chorus girls in giant headdresses out of some Busby Berkeley-style fantasy . These shimmering daydreams , afloat in dark space , pay homage to a bygone Broadway and to the movies of the pre-World War II era that have preserved its style for latter- day audiences . Between the wistful glints of remembered magic unfolds a plot aptly concerning two moribund musical theaters , one on the Great White Way , the other in dusty Deadrock , Nev . In both cases the solution is said to be simple : put on a bouncy , pretty , old-fashioned and campily funny extravaganza , heavy on ostrich feathers and light on social significance , and people will come flocking back . <P> Crazy for You was greeted with all but universal cheers last week , less for what the show is  --  a pleasant evening of well-loved songs and imaginative choreography hitched to a slow narrative , obvious jokes , completely undefined characters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bland assertion that Broadway 's future lies in its past . The second act contains two gratuitous slurs on the " concept " musicals that have dominated the past decade : a visual slap at Grand Hotel and a verbal slam toward Les Miserables . Yet those shows have precisely what Crazy for You so painfully lacks : propulsive storytelling , cinematically fluid staging , emotionally powerful character songs , and a sense that something urgent and meaningful is at stake . <P> The hoopla over Crazy is the centerpiece of a musical nostalgia binge that is sweeping over Broadway as it nears the end of a season in which the only truly new American musical , Nick &; Nora , died quickly and the one new musical yet to come , Metro , is being imported from Warsaw with an all-Polish creative team and cast , albeit performing in English . <P> A week before Crazy for You , which is touting itself as a new musical for awards purposes but is in fact a reworking of the theme and score of the Gershwins ' 1930 Girl Crazy , Broadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most Happy Fella . By the end of April , those shows are to be joined by Man of La Mancha ( 1965 ) and Guys and Dolls ( 1950 ) , and a belated transfer of the off-Broadway hits March of the Falsettos ( 1981 ) and Falsettoland ( 1990 ) , now paired in a single evening . In addition are three " new " musicals recycling songs by black composers : Five Guys Named Moe , produced by London impresario Cameron Mackintosh but mounted by Americans around the work of Louis Jordan ; Jelly 's Last Jam , featuring Jelly Roll Morton music and tap dancers Gregory Hines and Savion Glover ; and The High Rollers Social and Pleasure Club , a review starring New Orleans songwriter Allen Toussaint.
