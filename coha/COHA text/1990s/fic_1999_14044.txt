A bare stage . In the darkness , rolling thunder , and then suddenly cutting across it , lightning . The flashes illuminate a mysterious cloaked figure . Thunder . A special . The figure speaks . T-ANNE The American theater 's in a shitload of trouble . ( Flash , crash ) . That 's why the stage is bare , and it 's a cast of six , one non-union . ( Flash , crash . ) I 'm T-Anne , the stage manager , but I 'm also in the play . ( Flash . ) Like a lot of plays you 've seen at the end of the 20th century , we all have to play a lot of parts to make the whole thing economically viable ( Crash . ) HOMAGE TO THORNTON WILDER . ( Flash , crash . She drops the cloak . She wears blue jeans , a T-shirt , many keys at her belt . ) The date is ( current date ) , 2000 , just before noon . Well , I 'll show you a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here are the Broadway theaters , sort of between 42nd and 52nd Street , we like to think that 's the heart of everything . City of New York , State of New York , United States of America , the world , the galaxy , the universe . Down over here is Greenwich Village , around there we do off-Broadway , that 's good too . Now Tribeca , Soho , Lower East Side , we call that the " downtown scene , " off-off stuff . An incredibly colorful group of people who despise realism and have all won the Obie Award that 's good too . Beyond that , radiating out in all directions for thousands of miles is something called " regional theater , " which I understand once showed a lot of promise but has since degenerated into dying medieval fiefdoms and arrogant baronies producing small-cast comedies , cabaret musicals , mean-spirited new plays , and the occasional deconstructed classic , which everybody hates . After that , moving west , we reach the burning , uninhabitable desert and its militias who do n't go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the twin evil kingdoms of Flick and Tube , the bourne from which no traveler returns . Now back to New York , thank God . Let 's see , the Empire State Building , the Statue of Liberty and the Actors ' Equity offices that 's our union . They make sure no more than 80 percent of our membership is out of work on any given day . And over there yes , right over there is where we worship , yes sir , The New York Times . Well , that 's about it . Now , with a short subway ride we get to one of the audition studios where producers and theaters come to find actors for their plays . Here 's the front door , elevator up to the fifth floor , Studio C , where the San Antonio , Texas Actors Express has come to the big city to cast The Three Sisters by Anton Chekhov . He 's Russian . At noon , you can always hear the actors doing their vocal warm-ups . ( Vocal warm-ups can be heard . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon . Theatre folks sleep late . So , another day 's begun . There 's Lisabette Cartwright walking into Studio C. She graduated from the S.M.U. ( Southern Methodist ) drama department and began teaching third grade . Then she was invited all the way to New York for an audition because the producer once had her appendix removed by one of her uncles . Lisabette 's really excited , and her mom , who is at this moment canning okra , is too . Over there is Casey Mulgraw , the one dressed in the skirt/pants thing , a lot of people call her the Queen of off-off Broadway . She 's a little hung over because she just celebrated the opening of her 200th play without ever having been paid a salary . She also has a yeast infection that is really pissing her off . In our town , we like to know the facts about everybody . ( NOTE : All scene and costume changes are done by six female " changers , " dressed in a variety of contemporary styles , but all in black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small out-of-the-way table where she sits and follows the script . Three folding chairs are placed to create the waiting room of Studio C. Casey , a woman of thirty-six waits . Lisabette , twenty-four , enters . She has a rolling suitcase. ) p. 3 LISABETTE Hi . ( Casey nods . ) Is this the Studio C waiting room for Actors Express ? ( Casey nods . ) Three Sisters audition ? ( Casey nods . ) Oh , my heavens , it 's so humid ! I feel like I 'm oiled up for the beach or something . I surely admire your fortitude in wearing both skirt and pants . Bet you 're auditioning for Olga , huh ? CASEY Why ? Because Olga is older and homely and a spinster and has no life of her own and thus has assumed the role of caregiver to her brother and it 's usually thought to be the least interesting acting role of the The Three Sisters . Would that be it ? LISABETTE Well , no , I CASEY It 's what you meant . LISABETTE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Hi . CASEY Hi . LISABETTE I 'm Lisabette Cartwright , from La Vernia , Texas . Graduated S.M.U. but then I taught third grade for two years , bein ' scared of an actor 's life , and Maple Elementary loved me and wants me back anytime , but in a dream the Lord himself reaffirmed my calling so I made my comeback in Fiddler on the Roof but this is my first New York audition and I 'm so jumpy my breasts bob even when I walk real slow . What 's your name ? p. 4 CASEY Casey Mulgraw , one of my breasts had to be surgically removed because of a malignancy and I seem to be in remission but who knows how long that will last . LISABETTE Oh , my G-o-o-d-d-d ! CASEY Want to do one more take ? LISABETTE No , I would like you to forgive me for bein ' such a dipshit , pardon the language , Jesus . I 'm real sorry for your troubles and it looks to me like they did a real good match . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading for Olga for the obvious reasons . LISABETTE Really , I think Olga is the most spiritual of all the sisters . CASEY Good try . You do n't have a smoke by any chance ? LISABETTE Ummmm , I do n't . CASEY Cough drop ? LISABETTE Beef jerky . CASEY No thanks . LISABETTE I 'm auditioning for Masha . CASEY The dark , passionate , amoral poetess . I feel dark ; men call me passionate ; I 'm definitely amoral , and I 've actually had several poems published but they never , never , never let me read for that part . p. 5 LISABETTE Because you 're a little plain ? CASEY Thank you for speaking the unspeakable . LISABETTE I did it again , huh ? I 'm , oh my , very nervous but that 's just no excuse . I would like to say I 'm in way over my head and could I have a hug ? CASEY ( Not unkindly . ) If it 's absolutely necessary . ( They hug . The stage manager enters to speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behind her , a table with three chairs is set up as the audition room . Ralph Brightly , an English director , and Kate , the producer , are at the table . In a third chair , to the side , sits Holly Seab , a TV goddess who is pre-cast as Irina and is helping audition . ) STAGE MANAGER Ms. Todoravskia is ready to see you both . CASEY Both ? STAGE MANAGER Both . Hustle it up , we 're running behind . LISABETTE ( Still in the anteroom . To Casey . ) Do they usually see actors in groups ? CASEY No . And we 're not a group . ( Casey and Lisabette enter the audition room . ) KATE ( Rising . ) Hi . I am Katrina Todoravskia , Producing Director of Actors Express . And you are ? p. 6 LISABETTE Me ? KATE You . LISABETTE I 'm sorry , I forgot the question . CASEY Your name . LISABETTE Oh , Lisabette Cartwright .

CASEY Thanks . KATE This is the play 's director , Ralph Brightly ; he runs the Toads Hall Rep in London . RALPH ( Shaking hands . ) Well , a stone 's throw outside , really . ( Shakes Lisabette 's hand . ) Charmed . ( Shakes Casey 's hand . ) Pleased . KATE ( Gesturing toward Holly . ) And this is LISABETTE Oh my G-o-o-d-d , you 're Holly Seab . I ca n't believe it ! Holly Seab . I love your TV show ! Your character is so kooky and glamorous . You have such great timing . I 've learned practically everything I know about foreplay from that show . You are so liberated ! p. 7 HOLLY Thanks . LISABETTE Oh my God , pardon me Jesus , are you going to be in the play ? HOLLY Irina . LISABETTE ( Clapping her hands . ) She 's going to be in the play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't that cool ? CASEY ( Smiling , but a bit reserved . ) Yes , cool . HOLLY Thanks . LISABETTE I am so stoked ! RALPH Yes , well , off we go then . Three Sisters , as you know , by Anton Pavlovitch himself . I 'll just drop some breadcrumbs along the path before we hear you KATE Running forty minutes behind . RALPH Right . Straight along . Give you the gist in five words . Funny , funny , funny , funny , tragic . CASEY We 're referring to Three Sisters ? RALPH The Three Sisters , yes . CASEY Funny , funny , funny , funny , tragic ? RALPH Funny , funny , funny , funny , tragic . CASEY Okay , I can do that . p. 8 LISABETTE Do what ? CASEY Show him that in our auditions . LISABETTE Gee , I did n't think it was funny . RALPH Precisely , that 's to be our little revelation . KATE Forty minutes late . RALPH Right then , on we go . ( A young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . RALPH Let 's get cracking . JOBY Excuse me . ( The actors glance up , confused . The " director " tries to go on . ) RALPH It 's Chekhov , do n't you see , so we 're certainly not ready to do text . JOBY ( From the audience . ) Excuse me . ( The actors stop . They look to Kate . ) KATE Yes ? JOBY Is the director ummm RALPH ( Supplying the character name . ) Ralph . JOBY Right , Ralph . Is it supposed to be a man played by a woman ? p. 9 KATE Yes . ( To Ralph . ) Go on . JOBY How come ? RALPH You mean why am I playing a man ? JOBY I mean what 's the point ? RALPH Could you possibly sit down and let us act ? KATE Wait . ( To Joby . ) Hi . JOBY Hi . KATE What 's your name ? JOBY Joby . But I KATE Joby , we want to thank you for coming to the theater ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll understand this as a woman , Joby RALPH Could she please ( Kate silences Ralph with a look . ) KATE Eighty percent of the roles in the American theater are played by men , and 90 percent of the directors are men . The point of having a male director played by a woman is to redress the former and satirize the latter . How 's that ? JOBY ( After a brief pause . ) Okay . ( She sits down . Kate nods at Ralph. ) p. 10 RALPH Right . Onward and upward , eh ? ( He looks at Casey . ) What I 'd like you to do , sweetie , is use only the word " tiddlypee " as text ( He looks at Lisabette . ) And you , dear , will say only " tiddlypoo . " With these words , we will now play the scene where Masha tells Olga she 's leaving her husband Kulygin and leaving town with the soldier Vershinin . CASEY But there is no such scene . RALPH Yes , precisely . CASEY So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to audition ? CASEY That 's the answer to " why " ? RALPH Look , dear ( Lisabette , trying to circumvent the oncoming conflict , goes into the improvisation . ) LISABETTE ( You wished to see me ? ) Tiddlypoo , tiddlypoo ? CASEY ( Is it true you and Vershinin are in love ? ) Tiddlypee , tiddlypee , tiddlypee tiddlypee ? LISABETTE ( I am leaving Kulygin and going away with Vershinin . ) Tiddlypoo , tiddlypoo tiddlypoo tiddlypoo , tiddlypoo , tiddlypoo , tiddlypoo. p. 11 CASEY ( If you go , what will happen to me ? ) Tiddlypee tiddlypee , tiddlypee , tiddlypee ? LISABETTE ( You 'll be fine . ) Tiddlypoo , tiddlypoo . CASEY ( To Ralph . ) How am I supposed to know what she 's saying ? RALPH Well , that would be the heart of the audition , would n't it ? ( Casey tries once more . ) CASEY ( If you go , we 'll be left with Natasha ! ) Tiddlypee , tiddlypee tiddlypee , tiddlypee . ( She stops . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Really ? CASEY Well , yes , really . Ca n't we just do a scene using the script ? I mean that would be sensible , right ? RALPH Perhaps to an American actress , dear . CASEY ( Not happy . ) Ummmmmm LISABETTE Oh , but this is fun . Do n't you think it 's fun ? It 's kind of interesting . CASEY ( Slow burn . ) American actress . p. 12 LISABETTE ( Feeling the tension . ) Just really , really , really , really fun ! CASEY ( Burning . ) You know , Ralph dear you Brits are arrogant , pompous , chauvinistic , smug , insufferable boors who take jobs from American actors and directors because of the toadying of the American press and the Anglophile American rich , and I 've seen Chekhov done in London that really smelled up the place with its stiff-upper-lip , over practical , **36;145;TOOLONG style that has nothing , nothing to do with Russian passion or spiritual darkness , so JOBY Excuse me . CASEY ( Still on the emotional high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easy . JOBY Is n't this all just a little self-referential ? KATE I 'm sorry , Joby , but we are trying to perform a play and JOBY I mean it 's all just about the theater . Is n't that a little precious ? KATE Why ? JOBY Well , theater people talking about theater . KATE As opposed to theater people talking about the international monetary fund or the cloning of sheep ? p. 13 JOBY Well , is theater culturally important enough to be the subject of a play ? RALPH Nice of you to buy a ticket . JOBY Actually , they 're comps . RALPH Ah . JOBY I 'd think your only hope is to work on a deeply personal and profoundly emotional level . CASEY Well , the thing about the Brits is very emotional . RALPH And plays are n't ordinarily deeply personal until after the exposition . JOBY Oh . CASEY Later on , the play takes hold , and there is devastating loss and a lot of really profound metaphors that will knock your socks off . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JOBY ( A brief pause . ) Fine . ( She sits down . ) CASEY ( Going back , ) with its stiff-upper-lip , over-practical , **36;183;TOOLONG style that has nothing , nothing to do with Russian passion or spiritual darkness . So do n't give me that American actress crap ! ( A tense moment. ) p. 14 RALPH Right . Nicely done . I think I 've seen more than enough . Thanks ever so for coming in . LISABETTE We 're finished ? RALPH Lovely work , sweetie . ( Turning to Casey , smiling . ) And I quite agree with you , dear , when Americans do Chekhov , its just awash in self-pity . ( Casey gives him the finger and stalks out . ) LISABETTE Well , anyway , this was my first professional audition , and it was really a lot of fun , and I want to thank you for calling me in and I really hope to work for you someday and ( She begins to cry. ) and I 'm sorry I 'm crying . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to London but she 's right , you 're a real jerk . ( She runs out , leaving Ralph , Kate , and Holly alone . ) RALPH ( Ironically . ) Well , that was a breath of fresh air . KATE Ralph , I want to apologize to you as an American RALPH No , no KATE I 've seen hundreds , thousands of auditions , and I never RALPH No need , sweetie p. 15 KATE I mean , who do they think they are ? RALPH Made their beds , have n't they ? Fat chance they 'll be getting any work from this old British fairy . ( Kate laughs appreciatively . ) HOLLY I liked them . ( They turn to look at her . ) I 've been treated like dirt in situations like this , but now I 'm rich and famous and you need me so you 're sort of shit out of luck , huh ? So here 's the deal : I liked them and I 'm bored with auditions so they 're over and those two are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the requisite talent . HOLLY Well , neither do I so maybe nobody will notice . ( She starts to exit . ) One thing , though . The little sweet one from Texas should play Irina , and I 'll play Masha . Oh , and the Olga well , she 's Olga . Tiddlypee , tiddlypoo . RALPH So , Kate , love , I gather that 's the horse that pulls our custard wagon , eh ? KATE Well RALPH Not to worry . In the kingdom of the barbarians , shit tastes like veal . ( Lights change . Furniture is removed as Casey and Lisabette move into two specials , where they talk to their mothers on the " phone . " ) p. 16 LISABETTE Ma ? It 's me , Lisabette CASEY Mother , okay , do n't go ballistic LISABETTE I got it ! I got it ! I got it ! I got the part ! CASEY Yes , I know I 'm thirty-six years old , and I still have $40,000 in student loans LISABETTE Ma , Ma , wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to leave my day job LISABETTE I 'm gon na act with a TV star ! CASEY Okay , the real deal LISABETTE Holly Seab ! Yes ! Me and Holly Seab ; can you believe it ? CASEY Yes , it 's kind of a crappy part ; it 's some hick town in Texas ; the salary is like pesos ; I 'll lose my job ; you wo n't have anybody to abuse but , lest we forget here , I 'm supposed to be an actress ! LISABETTE Ma , it 's Chekhov ! CASEY Mother LISABETTE He 's a Russian . CASEY Mother LISABETTE No , it 's beautiful and wise and sad , and I get to be a real professional ! p. 17 CASEY Screw you ! Mother ! LISABETTE Love you , Ma ! CASEY ( Hanging up . ) Damnit ! LISABETTE ( Hanging up . ) Yes ! ( Two connected plane seats are brought on . Lisabette and Casey move to sit in them . We hear an airport announcement . ) GATE ANNOUNCER Flight number 270 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now complete . Flight number 270 . All passengers CASEY My dad 's great . I worked weekends for a thousand years in his hardware store . LISABETTE You are kidding ! CASEY What kidding ? LISABETTE My dad has a hardware store . CASEY Yeah ? LISABETTE You sorted screws ? CASEY Oh yeah . ( They smile . ) Your dad want you to run it ? LISABETTE Me ? No . He sold it . He works in a community center . CASEY Well , my dad wants me . I dream I take it over and I wake up , stapled to three-quarter inch plywood , screaming . Okay , the hardware connection . p. 18 LISABETTE You 're not married , right ? CASEY I 'm not married , right . You ? LISABETTE I ca n't abide sex . CASEY Oh . LISABETTE Well , temporarily . I 've kinda had some bad luck . CASEY Does n't hold me back . LISABETTE I was kinda doin ' it with my high school boyfriend in the back of his car , an ' we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CASEY Ouch . LISABETTE They said they 'd never seen that kind of whiplash . CASEY Sorry . LISABETTE Meanwhile , back at school I was kind of bein ' forced into an affair by my history teacher an ' just after that I was sort of halfway raped by a plumber . CASEY ( Horrified . ) Jesus . LISABETTE No , it was n't too bad really . I had to deal , y'know ? The only bad part was for three years I could n't touch a man , even like a handshake , without throwing up . Projectile vomiting , so there were some awkward moments at parties . CASEY You 're kidding me , right ? p. 19 LISABETTE No , really , it was n't so bad . I 'm over it , except really , really occasionally when I first meet people . How about your relationships ? CASEY A lot of casual sex . LISABETTE Really . CASEY A lot . Always with members of the cast . And I 've done 200 plays off-off . LISABETTE Wow . CASEY Outside of rehearsal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CASEY Of course , I 'm always in rehearsal . LISABETTE Oh , I really respect that . I 'm a virgin too . Except for being harassed , whiplashed , and on New Year 's Eve . ( Holly enters from first class . ) CASEY Hi . LISABETTE Oh my God . HOLLY I saw you guys when you came through first class . LISABETTE We walked right by you ! ? HOLLY No problem . I was enjoying some brain surgeon hitting on me .

HOLLY Well , hey , yeah I did , thanks but , you know , I was like nobody once too . Really down on the food chain like you guys ummm I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Maybe excepting my manager who has time for one client , me , and who would not care diddly dick if you guys had talent or not . ( A brief awkwardness . ) But the point is you did n't think I meant you had no talent , did you ? CASEY No , no . LISABETTE No , no . HOLLY Because you can understand I have no way of knowing that . I mean tiddlypee , tiddlypoo . LISABETTE Right . CASEY Right . HOLLY My point is you guys were disrespected and he had to pay . CASEY You mean HOLLY I mean , once they said you had no talent , I had to see you were hired . p. 21 LISABETTE Wow . HOLLY Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not happen in my presence . Like I 'm the respect police . CASEY Thanks . HOLLY No problem . So I just wanted to shed a little light . LISABETTE That is really so nice . CASEY Just think , all of us have been told we have no talent . HOLLY Exactly ! CASEY Well , that 's something to build on . HOLLY Yeah , that 's the other thing . We have to stick together down there in CASEY Texas . LISABETTE Oh absolutely . HOLLY Because I have this intuition it 's going to be like combat , but we stick together , we make them pay .

HOLLY I am saying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 HOLLY Directors are a very gray area for me . It has been my experience that they actually like to be fired because they suffer from severe performance anxiety . They have these pushy little egos but hardly any usable information , which makes them very sad and time-consuming . I would n't worry because after you fire them , they usually find successful careers on cruise ships where they are completely harmless . LISABETTE But to do that , is that ethical ? HOLLY Lisabette , I like you . I do . You seem like a very nice person . I 'm not a very nice person , but I can still appreciate one when I see her . LISABETTE Thanks . HOLLY In college plays , community stuff , arty nowheres-ville professional gigs like this , there is probably something called ethics , but up where the eagles fly and the wolves run , up where American presidents screw the actresses , there is only power .

LISABETTE But , am I right or am I wrong , he is really cute ! CASEY My take is if you ( She indicates Holly. ) come on to a guy , looking the way you do , and he stiffs you while talking about his kids , he is really unavailable . HOLLY If I come on to a guy and I 'm not saying I did that guy can kiss his previous life good-bye for as long as I find said guy entertaining . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly serious money . p. 32 CASEY I think serious money to me and serious money to you could be seriously different . LISABETTE But what about his wife and kids ? HOLLY AND CASEY Shhh . HOLLY Okay , forget the money thing . We 'll bet hair . Loser shaves her head . LISABETTE Wow . CASEY You ca n't afford to shave your head . HOLLY I wo n't have to . CASEY The guy 's straight from Norman Rockwell . HOLLY I could screw anybody Norman Rockwell ever drew . LISABETTE This is so yeasty ! CASEY Let 's get it on . ( She holds out her hand . Holly shakes it . ) HOLLY He 's going down . LISABETTE You are n't Baptist , huh ? HOLLY Hey , Lisabette ? LISABETTE Uh-huh ? HOLLY I 'm going to play Masha because it 's the best part , and the most powerful person plays the best part . That 's one of Hollywood 's ten commandments . You 'll play Irina , because I say so , but also because she 's the youngest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good doing her because you have yet to become a completely calcified diva. p. 33 LISABETTE ( Not at all upset . ) Okay . HOLLY Everything 's copasetic . Hey , let 's go to the apartment hotel and get settled in fleabag hell and then find some cowboy dive with pine paneling and get unbelievably plotzed before tomorrow 's first rehearsal , because I need to be hungover to face whatever director she digs up next . ( A scene change starts . Eventually , there will be two single beds , two chairs , and a rolling door in place . This scene is played during the change . ) JOBY ( From the audience . ) Excuse me . ( Scene change continues . ) Excuse me . T-ANNE What ? JOBY Well , I did n't you T-ANNE Hey , spit it out ; I 'm busy . JOBY Well , did n't you consider that role offensive ? T-ANNE Did you notice we 're doing a scene change ? JOBY Golly , as a person of color T-ANNE You 're a person of color ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate it when I forget . p. 34 JOBY But , was n't that ( Whispers. ) stereotyped behavior ? T-ANNE ( Again stopping her work . ) Listen , I have to all right , okay listen , Babyface , I would like to do something , almost anything , where nice white people like you did n't feel like they had to defend me . Particularly ( Whispers back. ) in the middle of a scene change . ( Goes back to work . ) JOBY But it satirizes your political T-ANNE Got to go . JOBY But , are n't you T-ANNE No , I 'm not . Want to know why ? JOBY Oh , I do . T-ANNE ' Cause if I did n't do the plays that offended my color or politics or sex or religion or taste , I 'd be shit out of work . Lights ! ( She exits . The scene light snaps on . Joby is still standing . ) CASEY ( To Joby , not unkindly . ) Sit down , Joby . ( Starting the scene . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as my beloved father would say , schnockered . ( Sings . ) Tell me I ca n't sing Karaoke ? p. 35 HOLLY You ca n't sing Karaoke . LISABETTE This is so amazing , it 's like a pajama party . HOLLY ( Patting her knee . ) It is a pajama party . LISABETTE I mean , here I am , just out of drama school , and I am completely drunk , talking with real actors in a real way , including a great actress of the stage and a great actress from TV , and it just makes me want to cry . HOLLY Do n't cry . Where did the vodka go ? LISABETTE Holly , can I ask you a question ? HOLLY Here it is . ( Pours herself another drink . ) LISABETTE It 's something about acting . HOLLY I do n't know anything about acting . LISABETTE Okay then , have you had breast implants ? HOLLY Yes . LISABETTE Yes ? ! HOLLY Yes . CASEY That actually makes me feel better . HOLLY I have had seventeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see before you . They have even reshaped my toes because I do a lot of swimsuit . p. 36 LISABETTE Those are artificial toes ? HOLLY They are not artificial , they have been slimmed . CASEY How much ? HOLLY Altogether ? CASEY For the toes ? HOLLY Seventeen thousand dollars . LISABETTE Wow . CASEY How much would it take to make me beautiful ? HOLLY You 're serious ? CASEY Yeah . HOLLY Take off the sweatshirt . ( She does . ) LISABETTE But beauty is subjective . HOLLY Not in Hollywood . Stand up and turn around . Over here . Over here , over here . ( Casey does . ) Look at the ceiling . ( She does . ) Hold your arms out like wings . Look left . Look right . Okay . I could be off 10 , even 15 percent here depending on bone and muscle structure , but my estimate would be $600,000 . CASEY Go ahead , flatter me . HOLLY Oh , there are divas who have paid more , and the kicker is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 37 LISABETTE Oh my God . HOLLY AND CASEY Pardon me Jesus . CASEY I 'm giving it one more year . ( Refreshes her drink . ) LISABETTE Give what ? CASEY This . I do n't have to put up with this hellish life . I have other skills . HOLLY Let me guess CASEY For six years I worked in a slaughterhouse . LISABETTE No . CASEY Yeah . LISABETTE No way . You worked in your dad 's hardware store . CASEY That was earlier . Where 's the chocolates ? HOLLY ( Handing her the box . ) There 's only creams left . CASEY I took the slaughterhouse job because it paid more than waitressing , and I could cut the pigs ' throats at night , which left my days free to audition . HOLLY Was there a lot of blood ? CASEY Gouts . HOLLY I hate blood . LISABETTE I faint . I fainted the first time I had my period . p. 38 CASEY I mean , look at us . Holly 's the Frankenstein monster . You teach third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dawn so I can do godawful plays for free in black box theaters built into linen closets in welfare hotels . This is a career in the arts in America . LISABETTE But now we get to do Chekhov ! It 's like lacework . It 's beautiful and delicate and demands everything . Everything ! It 's unbearably sweet and sad and painful , just like our lives . HOLLY Do n't you love her . CASEY Plus I get a paycheck so my mother will think acting is actually a job . LISABETTE No , but it 's Chekhov ! CASEY As long as it pays the bills . LISABETTE That 's so cynical . CASEY Lisabette , sweetie , I 'm not cynical . Look at me . I 'm like a beating heart you can hold in your hand . I just happen to live in a country where they give people who do what I do endless shit . LISABETTE But why ca n't it be beautiful ? I want it to be beautiful . CASEY Lisabette , you 're drunk . LISABETTE I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us are so sad , right ? I mean , I 'm sad because I 'm hopelessly nave and have absolutely no idea what will become of me , like I 'm running down the railway tracks and the train is coming . ( To Casey . ) And you 're sad because you 're hoping against hope when you really probably know there is no hope . ( To Holly . ) And you 're sad because why are you sad , I forget ? p. 39 HOLLY I am sad because that beautiful country singer dissed me , and now I 'm going to have to make him pay , and that 'll make me feel bad about myself , and that 'll put me back in therapy which means I have to switch therapists because my last one is too busy writing screenplays . LISABETTE See , Chekhov knows us . CASEY ( Nodding . ) ' Fraid so . LISABETTE To Chekhov . ( There is a knock on the door . ) LISABETTE Who is it ? KATE ( Outside . ) Lisabette ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to drink red wine with me and make love ? LISABETTE ( Sotto voice to the sisters . ) Oh my God . KATE I find you unbearably beautiful . I ca n't think , I ca n't eat . I want to produce Romeo and Juliet for you . LISABETTE ( To the sisters . ) What do I do ? ( Holly beckons her over and whispers . ) KATE I just want to hold you . You could move into my apartment . I have a satellite dish . p. 40 LISABETTE Kate ? KATE ( Still outside . ) Yes ? LISABETTE It 's a little awkward because I 'm in here having sex with Holly . ( She mouths " Pardon me Jesus " to the ceiling . ) KATE With Holly ? HOLLY With Holly . KATE Oh never mind good-bye . ( They wait as Kate 's footsteps recede . ) CASEY Now that 's Chekhov . LISABETTE Thank you , thank you , thank you ! HOLLY No problem . LISABETTE ( Turning to Casey , meaning Kate 's crush . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ) HOLLY Hey , Lisabette . LISABETTE What ? HOLLY In my world , you 'd be right there looking at her satellite dish . ( A change now moves from the apartment to a circle of folding chairs . It takes place during the opening half of Kate 's speech . ) KATE Dearest friends . Dearest , dearest actors . You may wonder why at this our first rehearsal I have spoken of my childhood for three hours . Why , I have told you of my mother , the only American killed by prairie dogs , of my father whose love of literature inspired him to inscribe three chapters of Tolstoy 's War and Peace on the convex side of a single contact lens , which was then tragically lost at Daytona Beach . These then are the threads with which I wove my love of the Russian Classics , and then carried in my heart here to San Antonio San Antonio is to Houston as rural Russia is to Moscow . The sisters of San Antonio , their hearts beat with this play . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know what it is to work ! This play runs in our veins . Its pain is our pain . The pain of the women of San Antonio . So I say to you , on the brink of rehearsal , the final lines of Chekhov 's Texas play , The Three Sisters , " In a little while we shall know why we live and why we suffer ! " ( Applause from those gathered. ) p. 41 CASEY But that 's not the final line , right ? KATE I was speaking metaphorically . CASEY Because the final line is , " If only we knew . " KATE Yes , Casey , that is the final line . Thank you . CASEY Said twice . KATE I 'd like to move on if that 's all right ? CASEY Hey , it 's your theater . KATE Thank you . Thank you . And now it is my extraordinary pleasure to introduce our fabulous director , Wikwitch Konalkvis , a fellow Pole and recent migr who has directed seventy-one Chekhov productions and WIKEWITCH Seventy-two . KATE Seventy-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KATE Seventy-one productions and WIKEWITCH Every one jewel . Make beating heart of Chekhov . KATE and I just want to say WIKEWITCH Make beautiful from the pain of love this life which is like some p. 42 KATE he is so WIKEWITCH You , I know , will play Olga . You have pain . Have loss . Radiating of loss . Good . Good Olga . KATE I just want to say , and I 'm likely to get a little emotional HOLLY Could we go around the room and meet the other actors ? KATE Oh . HOLLY So we like know who we are . Like we were beginning a process . KATE Absolutely . HOLLY Holly Seab , which probably goes without saying , Masha . CASEY Casey Mulgraw , radiating of loss , Olga . LISABETTE Lisabette Cartwright , Irina . ( Now T-Anne moves from chair to chair , being all the other actors . ) GUNTER Gunter Sinsel , Solyony . ALLEN Allen Greif , thrilled to be Andrey . JAMES James George , the hapless Tusenbach . WIKEWITCH ( Ferocious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T-Anne indicates it would take too much time to do every introduction. ) p. 43 T-ANNE ( On book . ) Talk , talk , talk , talk , talk , talk , talk , talk , talk . Introductions over . WIKEWITCH Okay , now I talk KATE Could I WIKEWITCH You are going to speak of deep love you feel for Chekhov KATE Yes , because when I was fifteen WIKEWITCH Stop ! This love for Chekhov is like American fantasy . You make God from Chekhov . You say Chekhov , bullshit , Chekhov , bullshit , Chekhov , bullshit , bullshit , bullshit . From God we ca n't make play . From God we make worship . Worship makes boring play . You want to know in this room who is God ? Who is God here ? LISABETTE ( A guess . ) You are ? WIKEWITCH This is very intelligent young actress . God in theater is interpretation of play . I , Wikwitch , make interpretation In this room , in this time , I , Wikwitch , will be God . JOBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking ! JOBY I mean , this is driving me crazy ! This is the whole problem with 20th century theater . This is part of the reason nobody wants to buy a ticket . We used to get stories ; now we get " interpretations . " The director is not God ! p. 44 WIKEWITCH I am God . JOBY You are not God ! CASEY Joby JOBY What ? ! CASEY A character is talking . JOBY I know a character is talking , so ? CASEY Who says it 's the author 's view ? WIKEWITCH ( Triumphantly . ) You are making interpretation ! JOBY I do n't care whose view it is , it 's pernicious . WIKEWITCH You are being God . Who gave you this position ? JOBY I have a ticket ! WIKEWITCH If I do not make interpretation , you can not make interpretation of my interpretation . You are secondary ! I am artist ! I fuck you with my art and you cry out . JOBY What the hell are you talking about ? WIKEWITCH Sit down , little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul . CASEY ( Trying to calm her . ) Joby JOBY I have never heard such unadulterated p. 45 CASEY Joby JOBY Sit here and listen to CASEY Joby ! ( Joby stops talking . ) Not now . JOBY Then " now " what ? CASEY You are the audience , Joby . If you talk to us all the time , you become an actor , and then you would have to come down here . Do you want to come down here ? ( Joby , still upset , stands in silence for a moment , then , making a decision , sits back down . Don Blount enters . ) KATE Don ! DON Running a little late . KATE Don Blount , everybody , Vice President for Grants and Contributions at Albert &amp; Sons Tobacco , our wonderful corporate sponsor . DON Do n't mean to interrupt . Please go on with the Art . KATE Thanks Don . Now , we have the opportunity to make Chekhov with ( Indicating Wikwitch. ) this fine artist WIKEWITCH Great artist . KATE Great artist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back in the scene . ) Could I just say a couple of things ( Taps watch. ) p. 46 WIKEWITCH Okay . I pee now . DON because , uh well , I 'm not part of your world I 'm a businessman . I actually have things to do . KATE Oh , Don , absolutely . Don Blount , everybody . Our underwriter . DON This is really a revelation for me to get to see what art 's really all about . It 's just that , uh ( Taps watch . ) So I wanted to say that Albert &amp; Sons Tobacco is really pleased to make this gift to the community of Four Sisters ( Casey holds up three fingers . ) Three Sisters . Sorry . Because Albert &amp; Sons Tobacco International we 're in 130 countries , but we feel our role in this community is to CASEY Kill people . DON Excuse me . CASEY Your role is to kill people , to target children and African Americans and to seek profit independent of any ethics or morality . KATE Oh dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no money and have no alternative to taking your minuscule handout , you hope to give the impression that you are on the side of life , when actually you are merchants of death . p. 47 DON ( Pause . ) Thank you so much for the feedback . Albert &amp; Sons respects others and their disparate and useful points of view . But in closing , I will say to you personally that if you take money from us it is disingenuous to make a pretense of morality and that historically , insofar as I understand it , actors were traditionally pickpockets , whores , and parasites on the body politic . Of course , given that your very profession is pretense , I still have the pleasure of enjoying your morality as entertainment . ( Taps watch . ) Got to go . Good luck with however many sisters you 've got . ( He leaves . There is a stunned moment . Lights down. ) @x The act opens with a bare stage , one folding chair , and an inch-high , two-foot square box that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masha . JACKEY ( The costume designer . ) Baby-darlin ' - honey- dear , your luscious body is a costume designer 's dream ! You have proportions goin ' on like Greek statuary on a good day ! Oh , my goodness ! Your " out arm center back to wrist bent " is a world-class pisser . Your " shoulder point to mid-bust to center waist " is to die for , and your " depth of crotch and nipple to nipple " would turn Cleopatra mauve with envy . Golly-goodness-gracious , darlin ' , you are Masha the bomb ! HOLLY But this is like , " Why have a body ? " JACKEY Well , a little draggy , but 1901 , if you see what I mean ? HOLLY I am not going out there dressed up like a funeral cake . This would be , in fact , a good dress for somebody ugly . I mean , Olga might look like this , sure . JACKEY Au contraire , my goddess , au contraire . Every man in that audience is gon na hafta keep his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luscious . People who wear ugly become ugly . Are we trying to make me ugly ? I am not here to suffer the revenge of the ugly Texans . And I am not beautiful in this dress ! ( Wikwitch enters ) p. 49 WIKEWITCH Okay , okay . So . Masha is great beauty , yes ? But is hiding . Hide-and-go-seek Masha . HOLLY The West Coast , we do n't hide it . All right , a slit  --  waist to floor  --  let a little leg out . JACKEY 1901 , honeydoll , no tits , no slits . WIKEWITCH Repress . Very constrict . Very dark . This is sex for brain peoples . HOLLY Brain peoples . Reality check , all right ? JACKEY ( Working . ) Ooooo , reality , I do n't live there . HOLLY I spent $114,000 on my legs . I was in rehab for three months with animal , killer , monster rehab nurses in the Dominican Republic . An Internet survey shows that my legs alone , without the rest of me , have nineteen million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Jackey has his head in his hands . ) Jackey , will you stop crying . Every time we have a fitting , you weep . JACKEY You think I want to make women ugly because I 'm a gay man . HOLLY Oh , please . JACKEY You think I 'm hostile because you make millions , and I do consignment store windows . HOLLY Okay , all right , I 'm going to try something completely new for me . I 'm going to try compromise . p. 50 WIKEWITCH No compromise . JACKEY I love compromise . HOLLY Everybody listening ? Floor length/see-thru . WIKEWITCH I am in madhouse . JACKEY Well , lil ' darlin ' , you would look delicious , but I keep rememberin ' what you said the day you got here as to how the play was about like a tidal wave of vulgarity sweepin ' everything good and beautiful away , which just made me bawl like a baby , and how the vulgarity of the rich was not to see the desperate need of the poor , and how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the vulgarity of the intellectual was to separate thought from action . So that everyone in the play was as different as they could be but in this funny way they all shared the same despair . HOLLY When did I say that ? JACKEY Well , it was such a pretty thought , you are such a talk-diva , baby love . But it made me think maybe Masha could be this little simplicity in the sea of vulgarity and get all the attention , an ' reviews , an ' applause , applause , applause . HOLLY Well , if I said that , that 's what we should do . WIKEWITCH ( To Jackey . ) You are God in other form . p. 51 JACKEY ( Sweetly . ) Well , she said . HOLLY No more talking ! ! ! The dress rocks . I got ta book to make rehearsal . ( The scene now transitions into rehearsal . At first we see only the director because Holly has a costume change . ) WIKEWITCH Okay . Okay . Please stopping . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brain outside , art inside . What you are doing in this time ? Hah ? Okay , good . Is very clear , is very smart , is very beautiful , is very professional . But is not art . No more professional . No good to Chekhov , this professional . No , no , no , no , no , no , no ! Peel off skin . Rip open body . Lungs , liver , spleen . Okay . Begin . HOLLY/MASHA " I do n't know . I do n't know . Of course , being used to something means a lot . For example " WIKEWITCH ( Interrupting . ) You say line . HOLLY/MASHA ( Confused . ) I did . WIKEWITCH Yes , you say " you do n't know . " HOLLY/MASHA I know the line . WIKEWITCH You do n't know ! HOLLY/MASHA I just said it ! WIKEWITCH Saying is not being . p. 52 HOLLY What are you talking about ? WIKEWITCH Look , little television actress , Masha say , " I do n't know , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so you just say line . So this little thing , this " I do n't know " is dead , and more you say , you go from corpse to corpse over this dead Chekhov . You make graveyard of scene by just say lines . No good . Okay . Her father , military man , is dead . Real corpse , not acting corpse . Since that moment , this Masha lives , imbeciles all around , peasant idiots , animals , mud , stupidity . Peasant thirsty for drink , they spit in hand , like spit for drink . Only soldiers , like father , have brain . She is thirsty for brain . She says soldiers honorable , educated , worthwhile . Vershinin is soldier . His soul is dead . He knows soldier is animal too . He says this . How can she bear this ? This is break her heart . He says this before scene . It is like stone . Like stone . You understand ? She says , " I do n't know . " Yes ! This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOLLY I do n't know . WIKEWITCH No . HOLLY I do n't know . WIKEWITCH No ! HOLLY What the hell do you want ?

( A pause . ) HOLLY Okay , I get it . WIKEWITCH You get it . HOLLY Yes . WIKEWITCH One line . Twenty minutes . You get one scene , I 'm dead from old age . HOLLY I really get it . WIKEWITCH Enough . Rehearse . Say " I do n't know . " HOLLY I do n't know . WIKEWITCH Okay . Next line .

I finish a play , it 's like , " Get me an exorcist ! " He eats my life . He chews me up . He spits me out . I 'm like bleeding from Chekhov . The audience ? Who knows what their deal is ? They come from the mists ; they return to the mist . They cough , they sneeze , they sleep , they unwrap little hard candies , and then they head for their cars during the curtain call . And once , once I would like to step out and say to the ones who are up the aisles while we take the bows , " Hey ! Excuse me ! Could you show a little mercy because I just left it all out here on the stage and even if you do n't have the foggiest notion what it was or what it meant , could you have the common courtesy to leave your goddamn cars in the garage for another forty seconds and give me a little hand for twenty years of work ! " p. 63 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOBY I do n't cough or sleep or unwrap little candies , I come to feel . ( She taps her head and chest . ) Here and here .

Then why is it called the Martha Graham Dance Company ? Oh . No , I knew that . Little joke . Listen , the grant 's in the mail . Yes .

My pleasure . ( Don hangs up the phone , picks it back up and dials . ) Mom , it 's Don . Your son Don . I need the favor , Mom . I know we did it yesterday , but I 'm feeling a little alienated a little remote . Wonderful . Good . I knew I could count on you , Momma . Ready ? All right , light it up , Mom . Inhale , Mom . Would I encourage you to smoke if there was any danger ? That 's right , I would n't . I would never harm my mom . I must be a good person if I would never harm my mom .

KATE No , I 've been wanting to DON Can I get you something ? KATE Well DON At this level in the executive suite , we could fly in crabs ' legs from Iceland . Just kidding . But in Iceland the crabs have pneumonia . Would n't affect their legs though . Just kidding . Tea , coffee , soft drink , bottled water , mixed drinks of all kinds , munchies , brownies my mother sends in ( Does his Dracula imitation . ) Cigarette ? ! KATE No , I DON You know , Kate may I call you Kate ? Nice dress , by the way . I deal with a lot of artists , and usually they look like they bought their clothes from the llama shop in Costa Rica . KATE Well , I DON I ca n't tell you how impressed I was by that rehearsal of whatsit you let me see . KATE Three Sisters . DON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives we all lead , do n't you think ? KATE Well I p. 68 DON Plus it confirmed my every doubt about corporate investment in Russia . In that way it was very personal for me . KATE I 'm glad that you DON So it 's a real downer to have to pull the funding . Oh , I think we also have fruit juices . KATE The funding . DON The funding . In a way here , Ms. Todoravskia , I have to tell you I personally blew it . I 've only been in Grants and Contributions with Albert &amp; Sons for a couple of months  --  before that , they let me do real work  --  just kidding , and I did n't realize when I gave you the okay that there had been a policy change up top . KATE Do you mean DON Let me just wrap this up and then we 'll relate . We had sort of turned our contribution policy on a dime based on the fact that all this tobacco legislation , politically motivated lawsuits , advertising restrictions have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future will be overseas where they just plain old like a good smoke . Plus their life expectancy is so low that we do n't really constitute a health hazard . Hah ! Just kidding . Just kidding . And it 's in those communities in our target market we 'll be looking to leverage our contributions . So the bad news is that I did n't have the authority to give you the money . I hope this wo n't inconvenience you ? p. 69 KATE But you did authorize it . DON ( Smiling . ) Poof . KATE But we 're in the middle of the work . DON Poof . KATE We will have to default on the salaries and the Board will fire me . DON You know , I 'm very interested in artists and how they function , and a little research shows an overwhelming percentage of the best work did n't have grants . As far as I can see , good art is almost invariably a product of good old-fashioned adversity and rage . Anger is the engine of art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . You do n't want to be the lap dog of big tobacco . We 're the bad guys . Great art is a personal passion , not a grant . Ms. Todoravskia , Albert &amp; Sons Tobacco is sorry to defund you , but that does n't mean we are n't proud to fuel your anger . KATE I can not believe DON I 'm afraid that 's all the time I have for you . I do however want to make a $75 personal contribution to your theater . If you wonder about the cost basis , it 's the same amount I give to public radio , which I actually use . ( She takes the envelope . He heads back for his desk . ) Oh , listen , I wonder if you have Holly Seab 's phone number ? ( Office is struck . The girls are talking  --  one seated . Kate enters with her suitcase. ) p. 70 KATE Hi . ( She puts down her suitcase . ) LISABETTE Hi . CASEY Hi . HOLLY Hi . KATE I , uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate it when my eyes are red ! ! Sorry , I 'm sorry . Look , I want to uh tell you how proud proud I am of you ( She pauses on the brink of something . It explodes . ) To hell with everybody ! ! Okay , that feels better umm , it was very emotional to see this great play being so well done in our little theater that has struggled and held on by its fingernails believe me for all these years . When I settled here , having attended Stanford , Harvard , and Yale , I hoped I hoped ! ! well , those rehearsals were what I hoped for as an artist . They surpassed my hopes . It 's one hell of a time to be fired . I 'll tell you that . LISABETTE Oh my God KATE Albert &amp; Sons removed the funding . CASEY Oh God . KATE And when I told Joe Bob Mattingly , the Chairman of our Board of Directors , he said p. 71 JOE BOB ( From somewhere out in the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hog on ice ! I been pourin ' my money an ' the money of my friends down your double-talk rathole since Jesus was a pup , so my wife could drag me down here to see plays nobody can understand with a buncha people I would never invite to dinner , on the basis it creates some quality of life I 'm supposed to have since I figgered out how to make some money . Half the time , that stuff does n't have a story , and it 's been five years since you done one takes place in a kitchen , which is the kind all of us like . The rest of the time it 's about how rich people is bad and Democrats is good and white people is stupid and homosexuals have more fun an ' we should get rid of the corporations an ' eat grass an ' then , by God , you wonder why you do n't have a big audience ! Now you just blew 15 percent of your budget ' cause you riled up the tobacco interests , plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' as of this precise minute , you are out of luck , out of work , an ' outta San Antonio , Texas . See , I am closin ' us down , lockin ' the door , an ' then , by God , we can go back to hittin ' each other up to give to the United Way where it will , by God , do some poor handicap some actual , measurable good , an ' I wo n't have to hear anybody say " aesthetic " from one year to the goddamned next ! Now , vaya con Dios , darlin ' . JOE BOB AND KATE You got three minutes to clean out your desk . ( He disappears . Kate speaks to Casey. ) p. 72 KATE So that 's it . They said if I was out of the city before five o'clock I 'd get six months ' severance and my plane ticket . What , do you suppose , I thought I was doing here ? Making theater because See I just ca n't remember . Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man can not live by bread alone . KATE No , he needs salsa . ( Shakes Casey 's hand . ) Actually , I think I hate theater . It makes you think it was about something when it was actually only about yourself . It fascinates you . It seduces you . It leaves you penniless by the side of the road . Screw Thespis ! ( She looks at the women . ) Run for your lives . ( She exits . The women look at each other . ) LISABETTE Goodness gracious . ( Wipes tear . ) CASEY You okay ? LISABETTE I guess . JOBY ( From audience . ) Do n't let it get too sentimental . CASEY ( Without looking up . ) Thanks for the tip . ( Turns to Holly . ) So that this does n't get too sentimental , why do n't you pay for the production ? You have the money . p. 73 HOLLY Why would I do that ? CASEY Self-interest ? HOLLY Ah . CASEY You want the credit . You do n't like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good in the part . Based on proving you can act , you might get a film where you kept your clothes on . And I could use the distraction from the fact the biopsy was positive . HOLLY That 's not too sentimental . Anything else ? CASEY No , that 's about it . HOLLY ( Seeing Ben enter . ) Hi . BEN Stay . HOLLY ( Turns to Lisabette . ) And you , little one ? LISABETTE It might make you happy . ( Holly chuckles . ) HOLLY Well , that aside , why not ? CASEY You 'll pay to get us open ? HOLLY I 'll get us open . LISABETTE No way ? HOLLY They screwed with us , now they lose . LISABETTE You really mean it ? p. 74 HOLLY I do n't want to talk about it , I want to do it .

Then wait for life to teach . You are sweet young people , but what I know ( Points to head. ) you can not do . What for I do this ? No sleep , no sleep . We must be a little realistic in this time . For you , Chekhov is fantasy . For me , life . You have nice , small talent . We can do together baby-Chekhov . Okay , but I have short time short time now no sleep no time for baby-Chekhov I must take small suitcase , find big souls to do play , so I do n't die with this Chekhov in my head . This you understand or not understand ? p. 75 HOLLY We 're not good enough . WIKEWITCH You do not understand . OK . Bye-bye . ( Goes to exit and turns back . ) You are good enough to do the Chekhov you are good enough to do . But is not good enough . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See , I 've always been terrified that some guy dressed in black would show up and tell me I 'm not good enough . HOLLY Yeah , but what he said was : CASEY AND HOLLY You just have to do the Chekhov you 're good enough to do . LISABETTE He did say that . HOLLY Okay . We 'll do the Chekhov we can do . LISABETTE Really ? HOLLY Really . LISABETTE Yes ! Oh yes ! ( To Casey . ) Can you believe this ? Can we please work on the last scene ? ( She picks up the script . ) I want to work on the last scene . HOLLY Where from ? LISABETTE The band . Ta ra ra boom de ay . CASEY We 're over here . HOLLY/MASHA " Oh , but listen to the band !

Trust me , you do n't want to hang around Malibu while I give head for billing . This is it . I will take no prisoners . You have to blow me off . You know what ? ( She kisses his cheek . ) Go back to your wife . Sorry to be the meat grinder . It 's just the way it plays out . ( Looks at him . ) I got a couple minutes , tell me to go screw myself .

And after I 'm a grown-up , I will try to like doing the things grown-ups like to do . Right now , I 'm thinking hardware store , I am worried , however , that I will make a lousy grown-up and that I will cry a lot and be depressed . LISABETTE Oh God .

JOBY But not really . LISABETTE No , not really . I mean , in the play they left . JOBY They do n't give me much space in the paper . I 'm kind of between the car ads and the pet ads . LISABETTE I did n't have a lot of lines either . Not like a lead character or anything . JOBY You were good though , with what you had . LISABETTE Thanks . And ? JOBY Oh . Well I okay umm . So I would say it played ( the time ) , you know ( the date ) , at ( the place ) , and umm a seriocomic , ummm , look at the creative drive and how the culture and , like , human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe breaks it umm , calls into question whether it 's kind of over for the theater you know . Pretty good acting and everything minimal set . I guess my question would be if plays , doing plays , does n't speak to the culture , then examining why , or satirizing why , is kind of beating a dead horse from the inside . So , uh , anyway , I only have about a hundred words to say that . You were good . p. 86 LISABETTE Wow . JOBY Yeah . I could send you a copy . LISABETTE Thanks . JOBY I mean , I 'm not a real critic yet . LISABETTE Oh , you will be . JOBY Yeah . I do n't know . LISABETTE Really . JOBY Yeah . Anyway . Bye . LISABETTE Bye . JOBY Bye . ( Joby leaves .

She looks around her . ) Wow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to act . It always feels like anything could happen . That something wonderful could happen . It 's just people , you know , just people doing it and watching it , but I think everybody hopes that it might turn out to be something more than that . Like people buy a ticket to the lottery , only this has more heart to it . And most times , it does n't turn out any better than the lottery , but sometimes my dad runs a community center , and back in the day they did this play called Raisin in the Sun , just about a black family or something , and it was just people doing it . He said there was a grocery guy and a car mechanic , a waitress , but the whole thing had like I do n't know aura , and people wanted to be there so much that when they would practice at night , ' cause everybody had jobs , they had to open the doors at the center and hundreds of black people would just show up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they brought dinner , old people in wheelchairs , and they would hang around the whole time , kids running up and down , until the actors went home , night after night at practice , and when they finished , these people would stick around and they would line up outside like a reception line like a wedding and the actors would walk down that line " How you doin ' ?
