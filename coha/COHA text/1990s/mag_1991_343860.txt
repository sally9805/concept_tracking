Although the angry young men are drawing most of the attention , they are n't the only black directors making movies these days . Other slices of black life are turning up on the screen in mild comedies like Michael Schultz 's Livin ' Large ! and in colorful period pieces like Bill Duke 's A Rage in Harlem , based on a 1957 novel by crime writer Chester Himes . The emphasis in these films may be on entertainment , but their directors still try to slip in meaningful messages and positive images . " I 'm an American , " Duke recently told the Los Angeles Times . " But being a black American , my experience is a particular one , and I do n't want to ignore that .
