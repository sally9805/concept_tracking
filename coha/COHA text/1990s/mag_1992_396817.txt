Skimming less than 100 feet over the dense Canadian forest , the pilot maneuvers his helicopter through thick clouds . The valley floor below us is barely visible in the fog . One look at my fellow heli-skiers packed into this whirlybird , and I can see that they are experiencing the same heady mixture of apprehension and excitement that I am . " The pilot 's flown up this valley a hundred times , " I tell myself . " He could do it in his sleep , by braille  --  no , let 's skip the braille part ! " Just as the trees before us disappear into the whiteout , we burst through the top of the cloud layer into blinding sunlight , moisture trailing from the tail rotor as from a dolphin leaping from the sea . A collective gasp fills the chopper  --  we 've entered an entirely new world , with islands of white peaks stretching in all directions , the sky an unblemished curtain of blue . In all that magnificent enormity , we are the only thing moving , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic jumble of jagged ice blocks and crevasses of a glacier spilling between two mountains , and the whop-whop of the helicopter blades deepens as we land gently atop the rounded summit of the taller peak . Scrambling out , we try to contain our excitement while following the disciplined unloading procedure we had practiced down at the lodge . Then the whirling rotors accelerate and lift the bird away in a blast of 100-mile-an-hour winds . The mechanical sound floats back down the glacier and is swallowed in the clouds , leaving in its wake an immense silence . Alone at the top of the world , we echo that silence for a moment , then hoot in delight . A long , gentle shoulder of sparkling , untouched powder stretches 1,500 feet below us , all the way to the clouds . " Alright folks , " our guide yells from down the ridge . " The next group wo n't get up here for 10 minutes . Until then we 've got this whole mountain range to ourselves . Let 's leave " em tracks to be jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide , we bounce into the rhythm of the mountain . It is the perfect powder pitch , just enough steepness to jet the skis effortlessly out into the next turn , just the right show depth to absorb the vertical energy and rebound the skis upwards in a spray of sparkling crystals . Twenty turns later , we drop over a small knoll into a deep pocket of powder that billows over my goggles . As I explode out of one blind turn , the brilliance of this immense landscape rushes into my open eyes for an instant . And at that moment , floating at the top of the skis ' arc , I unweight all the cares of the world below the clouds . This adventure had begun the previous Friday night , as skiers from all over the world were arriving in Calgary for the start of their week 's pilgrimage of powder . Doctors , tycoons , grandmothers , frat brothers on a binge  --  a wide variety of nationalities and personalities filled the lobby of the airport hotel to meet representatives from Canadian Mountain Holidays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories , but even among strangers there was the palpable excitement of skiers anticipating the highlight of their year . There was little time for conversation , however  --  in just a few hours we 'd be awakened to board a small plane and fly into the Canadian Rockies , the mecca of powder snow and that singular way of enjoying it . The next day , getting to Galena  --  which lies six miles from the nearest road in the Selkirk Mountains of British Columbia  --  required a one-hour flight to Kelowna and a bus ride to Revelstoke and a ferry ride across the Columbia River at Trout Lake , where a CMH helicopter picked up the week 's contingent of 44 guests and carried us up a high valley to Galena Lodge , a conglomeration of prefab modules with rooms for guests and staff and attractive dining and lounge areas . CMH 's definition of heli-skiing is much more than simply a helicopter dropping you into a powder field . CMH promises big portions of " guaranteed " heli-skiing and hospitality , with big price tags to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not including round-trip airfare to Calgary . The hospitality is guaranteed by the luxurious lodges that Hans Gmoser , CMH 's founder , has tucked deep into the Canadian wilderness . The luxuries include excellent staffs , huge gourmet meals ( and well-stocked bars ) , certified massage therapists , whirlpool baths , saunas , and exercise rooms . In addition , CMH guarantees that clients will ski a minimum of 100,000 vertical feet during the week . Those who do n't reach it because of bad weather or equipment failure get a refund of $55 ( Canadian ) for each 3,300 vertical under the maximum ; those who do n't reach 68,000 vertical feet also receive a $650 credit toward a future visit . But those who ski more than the guaranteed 100,000 feet of vertical pay an additional charge of $42.50 ( Canadian ) for each additional 3,300 vertical feet . There 's nothing guaranteed about powder , however . In heli-skiing , as in any adventure skiing , you might get a week of 100,000 vertical of breakable crust . At its worst  --  poor snow conditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for big vert will wish they 'd found a more creative way to spend $400 to $700 a day . Your physical condition also helps determine whether you get what you pay for . If you do n't work out or ski regularly before coming on a heli-ski week , you 're wasting your money . Skiing untracked snow in steep , treed , or difficult conditions is a lot different from skiing groomed runs at a resort . As Galena 's manager , Bernhard Ehmann , told me , " We hope that guests look at their week of heli-skiing as the culmination of an annual exercise program . " According to CMH spokesman Marty von Neudegg , fitness is more crucial than skiing ability . You should be a strong intermediate who can " handle whatever your home area throws at you . We can teach you the rest , " says von Neudegg . For first-time heli-skiers and apprehensive types , CMH offers Intro Weeks , where groups receive instruction and move at a " more leisurely pace . " CMH started Intro Weeks seven years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of its business . For many of the people I met at Galena , heli-skiing 's joys far outweighed all the costs and uncertainties . Some had been coming to CMH every year for well over a decade ; a surprising number book multiple weeks each season ( 70 percent of CMH 's business consists of repeat customers ) . I 'd heard about " double-A type " heli-skiers running each other over in a rush for vertical ( and yes , a few were there that week ) . But the regulars whom I met around a roaring fire the first evening were the most relaxed and good humored of the bunch . " I just enjoy being in the mountains , " explained ex-Olympic skier Brooks Dodge , who , with his wife , Ann , had been on Gmoser 's first heli-ski trip in 1965 and have been coming back almost every year since . " I do n't care how many vertical feet I get . " Still , even this group was n't here simply to socialize and commune with nature . These were hardcore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call and a splendid breakfast , we scurried out into the subzero air . Hundreds of years of skiing experience were represented in each helicopter load , skiers who had long since graduated from groomed slopes to " full-mountain " skiing . Considering the variety of ages , they were all in surprisingly good shape . From our first heli-lift it was obvious that we were in for some epic conditions . As we approached a high mountain saddle , the blades of our whirlybird blew the powder from the surrounding trees . Snow-crystal clouds were still visible a full minute later  --  powder heaven ! We spent much of that first day above timberline , up on the open glaciers and wide bowls that have come to define heli-skiing . However , cloudy weather or avalanche danger can compel some groups to spend most of their time on lower slopes among the trees . The mountaintops tend to have more-gradual slopes carved out by glaciers ; the lower , treed valleys are steep and exciting . Most of the regulars told me they 'd rather ski in the trees anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only took a few runs between the well-spaced trunks to understand their viewpoint : This was the world 's greatest tree skiing . Run after run , we dropped down the series of shelves that defines . Galena 's terrain . Six feet of fresh powder softened landings after unplanned air-turns . Following the " cold smoke " trail of my skiing partner , I knew that this was the best powder skiing I had ever experienced , or could ever hope to experience . As the week progressed , I also realized that who I skied with was just as important as what I skied . The guides separate skiers into four groups of 11 ( the capacity of the helicopter ) of like abilities ; otherwise , some skiers must wait while others struggle to catch up . With four groups skiing at different speeds , the guides can balance the amount of vertical each group skis with the timing of helicopter pick-ups at different parts of the mountain . Different attitudes can cause almost as many problems as different abilities . One group of Gitane-smoking French and Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their guide . By contrast , a group of American skiers spread themselves out across entire fall lines , ferreting out unseen paths between the trees . Mixing the two groups left no one happy . Even with ideal groupings , delays are inevitable . Heli-skiing can turn into heli-waiting when skis are lost and helicopters need refueling . At times like that , the good humor and conversation of one 's group become very important . Ultimately , such drawbacks are minor annoyances . What concerns most people about heli-skiing is its potential for danger . For one thing , helicopters have an exaggeratedly risky reputation . But the real danger in heli-skiing is the same as in all other types of backcountry skiing : avalanches . Nineteen-ninety-one was a particularly tragic year for CMH . Last March 's highly publicized avalanche killed nine skiers in the Bugaboos , the single-worst accident in the history of heli-skiing . Heli-skiing is certainly not a risk-free activity . During CMH 's 27-year history , according to the company , 29 people have died while on a CMH heli-ski week , with seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatalities at all from 1981 to 1989 . By comparison , avalanches have killed an average of 14 people a year in the U.S. over the past two decades . And considering that CMH has logged more than three million runs , the odds of survival are overwhelmingly in your favor . For CMH , as for every North American heli-skiing operation , " safety is our overriding concern , " emphasizes von Neudegg . CMH clients undergo an extensive safety orientation , including the use of avalanche transceivers ( to help pinpoint rescues should someone become buried ) , helicopter protocol , actual trial avalanche searches , and avoiding naturally occurring hazards like crevasses , cornices , and tree wells ( deep pits that form at the base of trees when the snow accumulates on their branches ) . But , as the March incident shows , no safety program is infallible . The bottom line : As in any skiing , you are largely responsible for your personal safety . And with each returning visit , dedicated heli-skiers affirm that the risks are worth taking . Despite the dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambient Gitane smoke , every one of us punched through the magic 100,000 vertical mark during our gorgeous week in the Selkirks , and did so in snow of a lifetime . It just never stopped falling ! But it was n't the quantity of skiing that I remember so much as the moments of surpassing quality . A run called Decadence alternated between perfectly spaced trees and enormous clearings of tree stumps buried in powder . A valley called Hanging Gardens began as a steep cliff , then fell into a rhythmic fall line of powder mounds that exploded with every turn . At the end of another incredible run , grown men  --  complete strangers four days earlier  --  screamed and laughed and hugged each other like children . And then there was a heli-ride early one morning when rows of glacial valleys below us were punctuated by wisps of fog turned a brilliant gold by the filtered sun . Is heli-skiing worth the time , the money , the risk ? At that particular moment , the answer was obvious . CANADIAN MOUNTAIN HOLIDAYS Galena is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aver 5,000 skiers a winter . The others are Adamant , Bobbie Burns , Bugaboo , Cariboo , Gothics , Monashee ( famous for having the most challenging terrain ) , Revelstoke , and Valemount ( the latter catering only to private groups . ) The cost of a CMH heli week ranges from $2,300 to $4,500 U.S. per person ( $5,900 for Valemount ) , not including the round-trip airfare to Calgary . The lodges used to be consistently booked up to a year ahead of time . But over the past few years , CMH has built three new lodges  --  Galena , Gothics , and Adamant  --  and in mid-January , space was still available at all nine locations until the end of the season on May 2 . To try heli-skiing on a smaller scale , consider a ski-resort-based heli-skiing operation . Make reservations during your planned visit to a particular resort , and if you 're lucky with the weather , you can spend a day flying to nearby mountains with a chopper and guide , adding a wild side to your ski vacation .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
