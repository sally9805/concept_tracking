<p> Washington Bullets coach Wes Unseld endorsed the acquisition of Pervis Ellison in June 1990 , solely because the club needed a quality big man . <p> Today , he acknowledges that the 6-foot-10 , 215-pound Ellison is more than quality . More than just another decent center . Far more than he expected . " I had no idea he 'd be this good , " admits Unseld , " and I 'm prejudiced , but he 's real good . " <p> Now in his third NBA season - and second healthy season - Ellison not only has joined the elite but arguably is the most versatile of the group . Exceptionally agile for his size , he scores inside with either hand , converts from the perimeter , puts the ball on the floor and passes effectively over double-teams . Defensively , he is a superior shot-blocker and rebounder and rotates quickly on double-teams . He ranks among the league leaders in blocks ( sixth ) , rebounds ( fifth ) and scoring ( 20th ) , and among centers trails only Brad Daugherty with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisville star , who was drafted No. 1 by the Sacramento Kings in 1989 , began his evolution late last season " when he started giving the game the respect it deserved , things like , getting his rest on game days , eating right , being prepared . I still have trouble getting him to keep weight on , but other than that . . . " <p> Ellison only recently has begun to set individual goals . While he received some consideration this year as an All-Star candidate , he said he already had begun to look toward next season . " I 'm at the point now where I 'll be disappointed if I do n't make it next year , " he said . " That 's definitely a realistic goal now . " <p> His other goal ? Finally having the braces he has worn since college removed . <p> " I have n't worn my rubber bands like I 'm supposed to , " he admitted sheepishly . <p> THE " DUCK " STOPS HERE : Former Houston Rockets coach Don Chaney reportedly thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Tuesday to give final approval to a proposed trade that would have sent Buck Johnson and Kenny Smith ( or Eric Floyd ) to the Indiana Pacers for Chuck Person and Vern Fleming . Instead , Chaney was fired on the orders of owner Charlie Thomas , who was reacting to the overtime loss to the expansion Minnesota Timberwolves the previous night . <p> Explaining his decision , Thomas said , " When I walked out of the arena following the T-wolves loss , I felt like I never wanted to see another game . I wondered how many customers felt that way , too . Something had to be done . " <p> Patterson first offered the job to Carroll Dawson , but after the lead assistant declined because of poor health ( he suffers from deteriorating vision and already is blind in the right eye ) , second assistant Rudy Tomjanovich was appointed for the remainder of the season . <p> Meanwhile , Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon , who privately had complained that Chaney was too lenient with the younger players , said , " It 's unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work out . " <p> GET USED TO IT : Stranger-than-usual happenings in L.A. . . . <p> The jayvee team ( Clippers ) last week threatened to overtake the varsity ( Lakers ) , causing tremors up and down the southern California coast . Rumor has it that the Clips ' five-game win streak - coupled with the Lakers ' historical six-game losing streak - has prompted Jack Nicholson , Dyan Cannon ( accompanied by hair ) and Michael Douglas , etc. , to consider swapping their courtside seats at the Forum for similar posts at the Sports Arena across town . ( Already Clipper Fan Billy Crystal stays put ) . <p> Lakers coach Mike Dunleavy , meanwhile , is accepting advice and inspiration from the most unlikely of sources , including the director of the Hare Krishnas . <p> " I got a nice call from him , " Dunleavy deadpanned . " He said he was behind the Lakers and would be willing to help us in any way . He said his prayers were with us . " <p> The second-year coach was kidding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie ? " responded Dunleavy , whose Lakers just completed only their second losing month ( 2-8 in February ) of the season - a first since 1979 , better known as the last season Before Magic . <p> A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE : Former NBA head coach Jack Ramsay appeared relatively unimpressed by his recent election to basketball 's Hall of Fame . Ramsay , who guided the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1977 championship , noted he previously had been selected for halls of fame at Penn and St. Joseph 's University , as well as for " walls of fame , " including one at his high school . <p> " I 'm up there with that singer , Todd what's-his-name , " Ramsay said . <p> Asked if the last name was Rundgren , he replied , " Yeah . That 's him . That 's the guy . " <p> Ramsay paused . <p> " But he got in before I did . " <p> AROUND THE LEAGUE : Magic rookie Stanley Roberts says former LSU teammate Shaquille O'Neal plans to turn pro at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the phone , " said Roberts . " He tells me he 's coming out this year regardless of what his father said . He said he 's tired of getting beaten up . " . . . Nick Anderson , out three weeks with a fractured right eye socket he sustained in an altercation last Thursday at a rap concert , says he has turned ice cold toward Ice Cube . " That 's the first and last rap concert I 'll go to , " said the Magic swingman . " People at those concerts are too crazy . I was trying to protect my sister , who was kicked in the stomach by another woman claiming we were in their seats . Some guy sucker-punched me , and I hit my eye on an armrest . " . . . You no longer believe in miracles now that Team USA lost to the Unified Team ? Perhaps you should reconsider upon learning that Mark Jackson had a vision before he hit a game-winning runner with 1.8 seconds left Monday against the Heat . Jackson said he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got the ball I was going to make something happen . " Kiki offered confirmation . . . . Though admittedly a nervous wreck during his presentation at Magic Johnson 's retirement ceremony last Sunday , Larry Bird said he was honored that his longtime friendly rival requested his presence . " It meant a lot to me , " said Bird . " It was touching to see the way they fans love Magic . You do n't see that very often in professional sports . It was touching the way they cheered me . It just shows that after all the booing and cursing and throwing stuff at you , they really respect you . " He added , grinning , " It was a once-in-a- lifetime thing to go into the Forum , speak in the Forum . You 'll never see a Boston Celtic do something like that again . " . . . While Rex Chapman is elated over his trade to the Bullets , new Hornet Tom Hammonds must be wondering what he did to deserve this : Asked his reasons for the trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't do this to acquire Tom Hammonds . " Rather , they were eager to unload Chapman 's hefty multi-year contract . . . . More troubles for Rod Strickland . The Spurs ' point guard was removed from the starting lineup Wednesday after confronting coach Bob Bass - a risky move considering Bass doubles as GM - following a recent loss to the Clippers . Bass had criticized the low-key Strickland 's lack of leadership and urged him to become " more authoritative . I want him to be a holler guy , like Kevin Johnson , Tim Hardaway and Magic Johnson . Magic was the worst . He hollered at everybody . " . . . If referees Wally Rooney , Hugh Evans and Mike Callahan had failed to arrive for the Kings-Rockets game , Kings owner Gregg Lukenbill said he would have sent the bill to the referees ' union . " You think they 'd like that ? " asked the financially strapped Lukenbill . " They 're supposed to be in the night before , or in the morning . " The refs had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sacramento . . . Pole vaulter Sergei Bubka , in Chicago for a Sports Illustrated photo shoot featuring Michael Jordan and other Olympians , failed miserably in his attempts to dribble and dunk at a Bulls practice . Jordan , however , reportedly did not attempt to pole vault . . . . B.J. Armstrong is urging the Bulls to trade him , but GM Jerry Krause refused to entertain offers prior to the trade deadline .
