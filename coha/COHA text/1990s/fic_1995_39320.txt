Mother rescued the three zebras that escaped from the London Zoo . <p> For years , I did n't believe it . <p> When I was really little , she would tell me the Luftwaffe 's bombs were as loud as a sweet potato man 's steamer , like a jet engine on the runway . When I was a year or so older , she let me know that the bombs were far-off whistles , exploding out in the suburbs . Then , when I was too old to be bounced on her knee , she said the bombs were hitting the flats next door , the bandstand in the park , the bridge over the Thames . One flattened the neighbor 's coach house ; blood dripped from baby Victor 's left ear . <p> Every time Mother told the story , she said she had run out to the street in her blue silk bathrobe and Moroccan slippers , a cigar jammed into the side of her mouth like Mt . Churchill . When I was little , she said the zebras had been s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her left hand , the other 's with her right , and the third zebra followed along like a tired old sheepdog . <p> But when I was older , she let me know that the zebras reared up and neighed . She lassoed one of them with an old dog leash , another with her belt . The third she wrestled down and tied up with twine , like they did on the ranch in Sonora . She told me one of the zebras kicked her , gave her a gash that needed six stitches . <p> Mother had a white quarter-moon-shaped scar on her thigh . One day , when we were all swimming at Eden Roc , I asked Victor , " Is that Mother 's zebra scar ? " When Victor wants to be nasty , he still says , " Is that Mother 's zebra scar ! " in a high , whiny little voice . <p> Mother got that scar in 1953 . She misjudged a mogul and went flying into a pine tree at Gstaad . <p> I call my maid : bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I place a slice of cool . <p> Mother died last month . Last week I cleaned out her closets . In a cardboard box , underneath a sheaf of letters tied with ribbon , I found a brittle newspaper clipping , so old it had turned orange . It had a picture of Mother in front of the zebra pen at the London Zoo , The caption said : <p> WIFE OF MEXICAN AMBASSADOR BRAVES NAZI BOMBS FOR LONDON ZOO <p> She was bundled up in a bulky coat , arms akimbo , her bobbed hair disarranged in a wind . She was squinting , in that funny way she did , her eyes very black , but bright . <p> I have an eiderdown quilt . The duvet is Pierre Deux . The ceiling over my bed is a dome made of lightweight bricks which are staggered precisely , row upon curving row , spliced with triangular wedges . When I told the architect I wanted a brick dome for the bedroom , he said it would be difficult : he knew only one man in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Chichimeca who lived in a village on the northern foothills . <p> Weeks passed . <p> The Chichimeca arrived in Mexico City without notice , on a third-class bus . I did not visit the construction site , but I knew he was there , balancing the bricks in my sky . He would have a wizened brown face and thick white hair . He would know only a few words of Spanish , which he would pronounce strangely , in a high , quavering voice . He would be wearing huaraches , the soles made from a bald car tire , and his toes would be splayed , blackened , twisted . <p> The dome is beautiful . <p> Wen Pao , my pug , lies next to me . I stroke her little head . Wen Pao has soft apricot fur . She snores , lightly . <p> Three months after the war ended , Mother , Papi , Victor and the staff were packed off to Buenos Aires . Then Rio de Janeiro , then Bogota , I think , and then Paris , where I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Place des Vosges . <p> Victor is much older than I. He was thirty when we came back to Mexico in 1368 . I was nineteen . I say came back to Mexico , but we had never actually lived there . When I was ten , Grandfather died and we left his apartments on the Place des Vosges and moved to the suburbs , St. Cloud , dreadful . Then the government changed , and Papi was posted to Jamaica , Kingston , blistering filth , smells of rotting fruit and butchered animals . Quito , cold and filthy . Tunis : hellhole on the Mediterranean . <p> Then Papi died . <p> Nineteen sixty-eight was a terrible year to be in Mexico , a terrible year to be nineteen . At the time , I thought it was wonderful . Every day was a clean vista , crash of energy and spume . <p> Wen Pao leaps to the carpet , barking furiously . My maid shouts through the door , Senora ! A boy is selling blackberries from Puebla , 35,000 pesos the kilo . I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for 28,000 at the market yesterday  --  ( pure invention )  --  but she can not hear me over Wen Pao 's staccato . I stretch . I toss the cucumber slices onto the bedside table . <p> Mother promised me the Aubusson carpets . She said that when she died I could have the blue one , the one with the festoons and the gold urns on a robin's-egg blue , a blue ( one of the few things I remember Papi saying ) like a spring sky over Provence . Mother said I could also have the red Aubusson , which is unevenly faded , and frayed in the center . Knowing Mother , I thought that meant she would leave me the red Aubusson and Victor the blue one . But he got both . <p> What did I say ? Yes to the blackberries ? Would I make a cheesecake with blackberry sauce ? Goose stuffed with blackberries ? Blackberries served in a crystal bowl with powdered sugar , a pitcher of cream on the side ? They would be spooned out into Mother 's French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the little black stars . <p> No ; I said no . <p> We came back to Mexico in 1968 . I was nineteen , which is to say I was nothing , Victor had a job with a French investment bank in the Colonia Centro . He also had a wife , a baby , a station wagon , a set of left-handed golf clubs , a cocker spaniel named Tartuffe . <p> Papi was on his deathbed in Tunis . He had gone on a three week trek to see the Roman ruins at Dougga , and had suffered an attack of appendicitis in the last week . Mother cried when she read the telegram . That same morning , Papi was carried into the embassy red-faced , screaming . His bed was brought down to the receiving room , which had a marble floor , cooler in the Mediterranean summer . He was sedated . A servant fanned away the flies with an enormous sheaf of palm leaves . <p> I remember the ceiling there , in the receiving room : it was a frieze with rinceaux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its corners and center , there were putti with tiny wings and monkeyish faces , all pointing to something out the window : a cinderblock wall . Belle epoque a la tunisienne . <p> All afternoon , Papi lay with his eyes squeezed shut , sweating . Sometimes he groaned , or let out a sharp breath . The boy with the palm fronds wove his arms over the bed like an automaton , hour after hour , his features registering nothing but concentration , rhythm . <p> I tried to mop Papi 's brow with a hand towel I had soaked in lemon water . He flicked open his eyes and waved me away . <p> Later that same afternoon , Mother said , " Well , you are not his child . " Just like that . <p> There is an ear-splitting whistle : the sweet potato man 's steamer . He sounds it every day at about this time . Chabelita is home from school , the dishes from lunch have been washed , and dried . The traffic has lost the energy of morning , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired droning . f I were to walk downstairs , I might hear the steamer clattering over the cobblestones . <p> Wen Pao sighs , and rolls over onto her side . She splays her paws , like a cat . <p> Once , when I was small , we came to Mexico City for Holy Week . My nanny bought me a sweet potato . She gave it to me in a dish , with a spoon . We poured honey over it , and heavy cream . Mother came into the kitchen while I was eating it . She slid it was a filthy thing , and if I got sick , ni modo . Nothing to be done about it . <p> We packed our things in Tunis and came to live in Mexico City in 1968 . Within a month I 'd developed an interest in literature ( a crush on Carlos Fuentes ) , in art history ( a yearning to travel in Italy ) , and in whatever my new boyfriend Esteban might suggest ( Asian philosophy , Jimi Hendrix , cannabis , batik wraparound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than I did when he was arrested . And it crushed her that when he was released , he had changed , become practical . <p> So whose child was I ? My mother 's and only my mother 's . I have her curly chestnut hair , her mouth with the puffy upper lip . I have her owlish black eyes . Her thick waist , her ample chest , her tapered fingers , the second toes longer than the big toes . I have her light spray of freckles across the bridge of my nose . And her skin so white , my veins show greenish-blue . <p> And now : I am just beginning to suffer her snowy hairs , that shock of white over my left temple . And too , the crow 's feet , the double chin , the age spots on the backs of my hands . <p> I have had affairs . <p> But would I have rescued the zebras from the London Zoo ? <p> The army occupied the university in mid-September 1968 . Esteban was picked up in the basement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was held incommunicado . <p> I did n't know what I was doing . I went crazy , shouting at people on the street , the newspaper vendor on the comet , housewives at the supermarket  --  especially the well-dressed ones , matrons in below-the-knee skirts and big gold Virgin of Guadalupe medals hanging down the middle of their buttoned-up blouses . They 'd reach for the Campbell 's soup and I 'd say , " The students ' six demands are perfectly reasonable ! " <p> There was Mother : she wore below-the-knee skirts and had a Virgin of Guadalupe medal hanging down the middle of her buttoned-up blouse . But when I said , " The students ' six demands are perfectly reasonable ! " she would say , " Yes , of course they are . " <p> The day after Esteban was picked up I took the bus to Victor 's office . All the way into the Colonia Centro , the bus lurched and rattled . It smelled of greasy food , and of bodies that have been washed , but without soap . I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansion on the Avenida Madero . The secretary showed me a leather couch . I sat there for a long time , crossing and uncrossing my legs . <p> I curled my lip at the hunting prints , framed in burlwood and black lacquer . I flipped through the annual reports that had been neatly stacked on the coffee table . Their thick glossy paper made me angry . Their photographs of fat men in pinstripe suits made me think of Papi . <p> I ca n't remember what I said to Victor . I know I had wanted him to help find out where Esteban was being held . I know I must have cried , said awful things . It was before the massacre at Tlatelolco . He ran an index finger around his little beige hearing aid and took a sip of coffee from his cup , a delicate Limoges . <p> " Long before you were born , " he slid , " we had to sleep in the underground , deep down , deeper than any metro in New York , or Paris , or Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would gather up water and blankets , playing cards and a good supply of candles and hurricane lamps . We huddled together for warmth , Mother with me and Papi , the servants and the guards from the embassy in their olive-green coats . I do n't actually remember this , " he went on , " nor the drone of the Luftwaffe , the smells in the underground , nor even the whistling sound of the bombs . I just remember how everything was being destroyed . Every day was going to be the end . " <p> He coughed and set his cup on his desk . " One morning Mother was waking me to my school on the other side of St. James 's . A German pilot had come down without his parachute . There was a tree branch as thick as your waist on the sidewalk next to him . He was nude . " <p> " Victor , " I said , " get to the point . " <p> " I kicked his head with my shoe is the point . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with disgust . " Mother slapped you of course . " <p> " Of course . So I kicked it again . " <p> Victor was useless . I was unable to rescue Esteban . I remember Mother playing hour after hour of dominoes in the library . She and her friends would nibble chocolates , and she began to spread . The wicker sofa groaned when she got up or sat down . She cried often , and kept a linen handkerchief in her pocket to dab at her eyes . <p> There was nothing to be done . <p> They let Esteban out a few days before Christmas . He said the police had lined them up , and beat them with their rifle butts . And herded them into a tiny cell without a lavatory . <p> I was so terribly impressed . <p> I married Esteban in 1970 ; I divorced him in 1971 I have lived as one lives without him since then ( marrying twice more , moving to La Jolla once , and back ) . Mutual friends tell me his management consulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second wife is an American , from Dallas , and she was a nationally ranked golf player . Or a tennis player , I do n't recall . Esteban has just made the down payment on a condominium in Cabo San Lucas , overlooking the harbor . I believe whatever I am in the mood to believe . <p> I had a daughter with my second husband , Sebastian . Her name is also Chabela , so I called her Chabelita . Sebastian was killed on the Cuernavaca highway eight and a half months before Chabelita was born . He was changing a tire when a cement truck hit a slick of water and swerved into him . <p> Mother hated Sebastian . Sebastian owned a chain of American-style steak restaurants . He wore Countess Mara ties and on weekends , white loafers . He played golf with Victor , and he actually liked the cocker spaniel , Tartuffe . He would stroke Tartuffe 's silky muzzle , and whisper things in its ears . <p> " What in God 's name are you telling that dog ? " Mother thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother would sing her funny songs . <p> Up above the world you fly , <p> Like a teatray in the sky . <p> She would ask her riddles : " Why is a raven like a writing desk ? " Once , Mother asked Chabelita the riddle of the Sphinx . Mother searched her little fact , and tucked her curls behind her ears . " Why it 's woman ! " she said , and kissed Chabelita 's fat baby cheeks . <p> When I was five years old , and Victor sixteen , we were left alone for a weekend in the apartment in Paris . My nanny had left without her pay , I can not remember why ; Papi was in Mexico , Mother had gone to ski in Gstaad . Victor tried to entertain me with his jigsaw puzzle collection , unsuccessfully , because when I could n't fit the pieces together , I would force them . When he took my work apart , I cried and punched him . Then he shut me up in my bedroom , but I howled until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Victor got the idea that we should dig up the tiny garden out back , searching for treasure . We dug around and under every single bush and plant , and even poked a spade in between the roots of an old tree . It was a cold and dirty business , but we worked all afternoon Saturday , and the greater part of Sunday . The amazing thing is , Victor actually found something . Behind a pruned rosebush , he unearthed a rotted leather bag of silver coins . <p> When Mother returned on Monday morning , we found her hunched over a steaming cup of Turkish coffee , her eyes squeezed shut . Victor emptied the coins out on the breakfast table . They made sharp clicks and thuds on the blackened oak surface , and Mother 's eyes opened very bloodshot , very wide . She most spit out her coffee . <p> " You 've stolen them , " she said flatly . Victor was indignant . He kicked a leg of the table , too hard . He hopped away biting his lip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the garden ! " And suddenly , she smiled at me so warmly . " The war , " she whispered , as if to herself , and began to laugh . I think that was the last moment I loved her without reserve : I climbed on her lap and clasped my arms around her neck . Her face was tanned , her cheeks windburned . She smelled of calamine lotion and hot coffee . <p> From the corner by the sideboard , Victor said , " They are my coins . " <p> " Why ? " Mother said , and she scooped them off the table into her purse . <p> After Sebastian 's funeral I went back to our apartment and sat on the bed . I should have thrown the curtains open ; perhaps that simple gesture would have saved me . But I sat on the bed , weighted down as if by stones , and as the afternoon slipped by I could no longer recall his face , or his voice . I knew his features by rote  --  the curve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlobes , the oblong mole on his cheek . But they were like scattered pieces of a puzzle ; they did n't fit , they did n't make a whole . I remembered that he liked to sing along with his Lucha Villa records ; I remembered that as he went out the door to work , he always winked and said , " Ciao , Baby . " But his words ran through my mind in my own voice , as if I were reading aloud from strips of paper . And somehow it chilled me that his clothes were still hanging next to mine in the closet , that his credit cards and cuff links were lying in a box under my shoes . <p> Mother had to come take care of me . She plumped the pillows and made me lemongrass tea . She brought glossy magazines and she turned the pages for me . She brushed my hair with slow gentle strokes . <p> Days later , when I was well enough to get up and put on my bathrobe , I saw that Mother had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I went to brush my teeth , I found that she had removed all the medicines , even the aspirin . <p> On Chabelita 's tenth birthday , Mother gave her a leather pouch . It was new and supple , and quite heavy . Chabelita untied the strings and emptied it over the carpet : out tumbled ten silver coins the size of sand dollars . <p> I bent down and picked one up . It was a Mexican coin , with a sunburst and a lumpy cap . LIBERTAD , it said . Liberty . On the obverse was the eagle perched on a cactus , a snake writhing in its beak  --  but with a Chinese character crudely stamped into its wing . <p> Mother was beaming at Chabelita . " You see those Chinese stamps ? There was a time when the peso was worth something . " <p> " Now pesos are for spending , " I said . I thought that was terrifically witty . <p> " You must hide them in a safe place , " Mother was telling Chabelita , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Suddenly I realized : these were the coins Victor and I had dug up in that garden . <p> Chabelita held one of the coins in her palm , rotating it as she read the minute lettering . " Why would I forget them , Grandma ? " <p> She looked exactly like I did at that age . <p> Sebastian was killed eight and a half months before Chabelita was born . I had been seeing his brother . He was a politician with the PAN , always running , always losing . He made his money in plastic tubing . We met on Tuesdays at the Camino Real . We ordered room service . <p> After the funeral , his brother would n't speak to me . Later , Mother told me he 'd given his house to the Opus Dei . <p> Que pendejo , she said . What an ass . <p> my third husband , my current husband , Juventino , was in London with Victor , on business . I told him I had to shop . <p> " Shop till you drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quilt there , at a boutique on East 63rd Street . I had a devil of a time getting it into my suitcase . <p> Karl and I jumped up and down on the suitcase to flatten the feathers . <p> The Pierre Deux duvet , I bought in New York as well . <p> My robin 's egg-blue Aubusson , at auction . <p> And Wen Pao , my furry baby . She was the smallest in a litter of pugs we saw in a pet-shop window on East 78th Street . When she saw us walking by , she stood up on her hind legs , her front paws pressed against the glass . <p> Karl gave me her red ostrich leather Hermes collar . <p> We walked Wen Pao in Central Park , every day for a week . It was early November and the leaves were still brilliant orange , burnt sienna , the red of Wen Pao 's collar . The air was sharp and clean , and bittersweet with the smell of pretzels and roasting chestnuts . " Liebling , " Karl would whisper into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brush his chill lips across my cheek , " Steh Kopf , " stand on your head . Nonsense . Dance the mambo . Make me a frog leg sandwich with this American ketchup . But I would return his kiss , his clear-eyed gaze , that satisfied laugh that will always make me think of salted chestnuts shaken in a newspaper cone . We held hands as we shuffled through the brittle leaves , my buttery deerskin glove against his , rough and black . When Wen Pao tired , Karl would pick her up and carry her in his coat . <p> On the last day , we were walking behind the band shell when I thought I saw Mother with a black man , Rollerblading down East Drive . Her snowy hair , thick waist and ample chest , her back still strong though curved with years . She was wearing striped stretch pants and a white sweatshirt that said FREE THE  --  I could not read the rest ; she disappeared around a bend . <p> " Das bist du , " Karl said , pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother died of a stroke in Mexico City the following week . I found her suitcases piled in the foyer , still packed . I tore off all the luggage tags . Kennedy , Orly , Gatwick , and two others I did n't recognize . <p> Victor asked me where she was going ; I said I had no idea . Those letters I found in her closet , tied with silk ribbon : I burned them , one by one . Postmarked Rangoon , postmarked Berlin , London , Lugano . 1927 , 1987 . Brittle ivory foolscap , red block-letter stamps , browned fountain-pen ink , a black wax seal , cracked through the center . Words floated out at me : Rue , dear , raining very hard since Easter , love , will you ? have you ? Gstaad , this damn , war . I stated at the flame and let my eyes water . Had I read them ? <p> I might have . <p> I see my life in leopard print : spotted with black spots .

His hair is white , running around the rim of his scalp like a stripe . His bald spot has grown . <p> " Is that Mother 's zebra scar ? " <p> I wish I had never asked him . <p> Out my bedroom window , the sky is electric orange . If I could see through my brick dome , the sky would be a starless indigo . I have to do my nails , crimson . I have to set my hair . I will wear my gray wool Louis Ferraud , my faux pearls , my Chanel wristwatch , a few daubs of Joy de Patou . Juventino will pick me up for a dinner at the German Embassy , where they will serve us canapes and champagne next to the Christmas tree . There will be a quartet playing Haydn and Handel , and everywhere , the sweet musky perfume of beribboned swags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining room , for goose with blackberry sauce , Black Forest cake , coffee and liqueurs .
