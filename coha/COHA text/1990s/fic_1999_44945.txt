Terry Bisson is the author of about half a dozen novels , including Fire on the Mountain , Talking Man , and Pirates of the Universe . He is also a master of one of the most difficult literary forms , that of the short-short story . Tales like Next , " " Partial People , and " They 're Made Out of Meat " waste no words in conveying character and concepts that stick in the mind like barnacles on a hull . ( When you find yourself thinking of this new story at unexpected moments , do n't say you were n't warned . ) <p> AMAZING , IS N'T IT ? I guess . It would be even more amazing , as Oscar Wilde once said , if the water did n't fall . Oscar Wild ? The weiner guy ? A famous funny sayings guy . From long ago . I think he played the piano , too . Anyway , it could happen . Or not happen . What not happen ? The water not fall . I get it . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about Smoother . Sorry . It 's just that , there it is . Smoothing along . One hundred twenty miles a day , day after day . So what ? So what does that have to do with us , you and me , here and now ? Nothing . And everything . Smoother 's not even heading this way . Not now . I get it . You 're talking about the whole world again . Well , for your information , at the rate it 's going , Smoother will take thousands of years to smooth out the entire world . More like hundreds . Do the math . Okay , I 'll do the math . It 's a mile wide , it moves at about five miles per hour ... Eight point four kilometers per hour , to be exact . And Smoother is 2.173 kilometers wide . Whatever . Metric Smoother , then . Either way , we 're talking about a long time . The world is huge . Smoother just smoothes a little strip . That little strip , as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smoother smoothes an area the size of England . Smoother has already smoothed a strip long enough to stretch around the world five times at the equator . Most of it worthless land . Most of it ocean floor . In a few hundred years the whole world will be as smooth and featureless as a pool ball . A giant beige cue ball . Lighten up ! You and me wo n't even be around in a few hundred years . Our children will . We do n't have any children . And we never will if we spend our entire Honeymoon worrying about Smoother . It would be more amazing if it did n't smooth , according to your wildman guy . And it could be worse . Smoother takes its time . It 's moving at a walk . A fast walk . Still . People have plenty of time to get out of the way . Nobody 's been killed by Smoother since Malta , and that was sort of a sneak attack . And those villages in India . Hey , it was n't Smoother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have TV . Same difference . And then they hung around , getting in the way , wanting to watch . I know how they felt . Everybody wants to watch . Not me . I got enough of Smoother when I was in the army . You told me you only saw it at a distance , once . Once was enough . I was in a helicopter . They were trying to cut it off with bombs . What was it like ? Same as on TV . A ribbon of smooth nothing , about a mile wide , unrolling over everything . Flat . Sort of beige . No noise . Kind of a hump in the front , about four stories high I do n't mean Smoother . I mean , what was it like trying to stop it ? Stupid . Pointless . You saw it on TV . They shot at it , bombed it , tried to dig under it . Most of the guys killed were killed by friendly fire . And of course , the nuke . That was super stupid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just let Smoother smooth out the whole Earth without trying to stop it . Sure you can . Especially if there 's nothing you can do about it . And no matter what we do , it keeps going at the same speed , winding its way around the world , smoothing out whatever is in front of it , leaving behind that mile-wide smooth strip of nothing , like a yellow brick road . Beige . Beige , then . Rain evaporates as soon as it hits it . It wo n't bum , it wo n't break , it wo n't They say you can walk across it . You can jump up and down on it howling at the Moon , if you want to , but you ca n't get rid of it or change a damn thing about it . Once it 's there , it 's there . Period . Finis . End of story . Get it ? Now who 's the one that 's all hot and bothered ? Sorry . It 's not Smoother that bothers me , it 's all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I 'm not mentioning any names . Notice how I 'm not mentioning any names ? So just forget Smoother . Is that what you 're saying ? Exactly . What if you ca n't ? It 's a discipline . It 's all about living in the Now . Which is our Honeymoon , in case you 've forgotten . Why do n't you come over here . Not in the mood . Let 's see what 's on TV . Damn ! I should have known . Smoother looks kind of peaceful on the small screen , does n't it ? Spiritual , almost . It 's disgusting . It 's smoothing a bunch of desert . Now tell me , is that so terrible ? That 's Africa . Last month it barely missed Kilimanjaro . See ! A miss is as good as a mile ! But it will get it eventually . That 's the thing . It will smooth everything . No matter what it hits or misses , Smoother will keep going , around and around the world , until every square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad ! Why dwell on doom and gloom ? You 'll be gone long before it happens . In the meantime , why not sell the roses ? Smell the roses . Whatever . Look at those elephants run ! Smoother can be cool if you let yourself get into it . Remember when it went through China and took out a twenty-mile section of the Great Wall ? That was horrible . But spiritual too ! Nothing lasts forever . Not even the Great Wall of China . Not even the Taj Mahal , though part of it 's still there . Most of it 's gone . Is the glass half full or half empty ? I say it 's half full ! What 'll you say when the glass is gone ? Listen to you ! Sometimes I think if there was n't a Smoother , people would invent one . Just to have something to worry about . Like me . I did n't mention any names . See how I 'm not mentioning any names ? Just because I 'm concerned . Are n't you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being obsessed . When I see Smoother heading my way , I will worry . Until that happens , I want to enjoy my - our - Honeymoon . What 's left of it . I get it . Your feelings are hurt . You think I care more about Smoother than about you . Well , do n't you ? Of course not . It 's just that - I hate Smoother so much ! There 's that word I hate : Hate ! But seriously , life 's too short to waste on hating . Just accept Smoother for what it is . Which is  --  what ? Maybe there are some mysteries we are not supposed to unravel . Think how boring life would be if Nature had no secrets ! Nature wo n't , when Smoother gets through . Do n't you ever wonder where it came from ? What it 's doing here ? Maybe it was here all along and we never noticed it . Maybe it dropped in from another galaxy . Maybe some crazy guy made it in his garage . Maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And it 's pretty obvious what it 's doing here . But why ? Want to know my theory ? I think Smoother is here to remind us that life is about Change . Smoother is about the end of Change . When it 's finished the Earth will be a smooth ball floating through space . No water , no wind , no people , no life at all . That 's Change , is n't it ? Stop trying to control everything all the time . Think different . Live in the Now . Hell , it 's kind of pretty , smoothing along across the veldt anyway . It is veldt , is n't it ? Do you say the " d " ? Or is it the savannah ? Both . Either . Neither . I do n't know . Never mind , Sooner or later it 'll all just be a big smooth yellow nothing anyway . Beige . You said yourself it was beige . Hey ! Why 'd you turn the TV off ? I thought you were sick of Smoother . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . But hey , this is our Honeymoon , and the water 's still falling , as your wildman would say . Why do n't you come over here with me . Because I 'm not in the mood . Plus I have a headache . On our Honeymoon ? Try one of these . Tylenol ? Better . It does n't stop the pain , it goes straight to the brain and blocks the consciousness of pain . So you do n't feel it ? You feel it , but you do n't feel it as pain . Might even work on your mood . Sounds good . I 'll give it a shot . What 's it called ?
