Staff of the Oracles " 1999 , cotton , wire , wood , gold leaf , 67 by 9 by 9 Inches ( coiled section 18 inches high ) . // CLOCKWISE FROM ABOVE : The artist 's drawing for a work in progress with numerals referring to DMC embroidery floss color numbers ; Egyptian Oxen , 1999 , cotton , wire , 12 1/2 by 7 by 7 inches ; Staff of the Red Helfer , s999 , cotton , wire , wood , 65 by 10 by 4 1/2 inches ( coiled section 17 Inches high ) . // Curled up in a wicker chair in her tiny Arizona studio , Carol Eckert fabricates coiled vessels , boxes , staffs and sceptors encrusted with fanciful flora and fauna . Working in small scale-a quality she attributes in part to her studio 's modest dimensions-Eckert dexterously wraps thin copper wire with DMC cotton embroidery floss , securing it in neat coils with her signature " figure eight " stitch . She focuses intently on the work as well as on the broad vision in her mind 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the limitations of her technique . Eckert studio bristles with the results of her recent labors.At one end stand two wood staffs topped with figural finials no taller than 18 inches . Eckert imagines these new forms , the first of her works to deviate from conventional containers , to be ritual accouterments of a distinguished chieftain . Standing atop her desk , oak floss cabinet and antique chest of drawers are other pieces with ceremonial overtones : a scepter , vessels with stoppers that might have graced an ancient tomb , and figural boxes with secret compartments . Autumn Ceremonies " ggg , for example , opens to reveal talismans , including a heart pierced by a minuscule silver arrow . Certain works , such as Staff of the Red Heifer , 1999 , have sealed within them tokens made by Eckert whose identity is known only to her . Some collectors , Eckert admits , are apprehensive about the presence of such buried treasure . Their wariness , she says , is testimony to what African legends describe as the mesmerizing power of the small . Each artifact-scaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters " that admirers of Eckert 's work have come to know over some 20 years . These shore birds , beasts and reptiles pose amid plants of indeterminate species . Aligned in rows , in confronting or opposing pairs , or stacked in tiers , they beckon . Each seems to have its own tale to tell , while all together they constitute a greater story . Eckert spent hours as a child busily amusing herself with scraps of fabric , needle and thread . What inspired her then as now were folktales , legends and myths.Some she learned from her Swedish grand mother ; others she absorbed from books . Reading-especially mythology-remains an important part of her conceptual process . As she ponders the legends of old-Egyptian , African , Minoan , Scandinavian , Oceanic and preColumbian-Eckert distills lessons that transcend particular cultures and epochs . She avoids literal interpretations ( her works " are not illustrations , " she insists ) , preferring to let her imagination come into play . The winsome creatures who act out the legends seldom duplicate nature . For example , in Autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific , but others are just birds , " she says , pointing to a line of long-legged , slender-billed avians in Presiding Spirits , 1999 . They are not caricatures . Yet , Eckert knowingly exaggerates a feature or elongates a line to coaxthe essence of the animal from its miniature reverse-coiled frame . Occasionally she creates abstracted hybrids . Thus , a blackish four  --  legged beast-a recurring element-evokes in equal parts the wild dog , javelina or hyena . " It 's a wolf-coyote type , " she explains , derived less from her years of living in the Southwest desert than from her grandmother 's folktales . So frightened was Eckert by childhood stories of wolves chasing sleighs through the moonlit Scandinavian woods that she often had nightmares : would such beasts climb the eight flights of the fire escape outside her New York City apartment and devour her as she slept ? Today , the wolf-coyote in such pieces as Presiding Spirits may represent the dark side of nature , tempered by those animals that signify good fortune . " Birds , " she explains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serpents figure prominently in her work . Common garter snakes are among the most versatile- " they have such a wonderful line compositionally . " Some slither across rows of coils , a few drape from pointy beaks like festoons of emerald-colored silk , while others , as in Staff of the Oracles , 1999 , , protrude from a gleaming , gold-leafed basket . Captivated by duality , Eckert insists that snakes can be good as well as evil . But , she adds dryly , there are certain collectors who request " snake-free " pieces . " I think my works are joyful , " she says , " not funny , really , but they often make people smile . That joyfulness begins with the historical pieces I admire . But , " she concludes , " I also enjoy making them , and I regard myself as a happy person , so that probably influences my work . " Eckert 's solitary , purposeful way of working might well epitomize bliss . Within her studio is everything she needs to be content and productive . Beyond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known through the occasional clanking of wind chimes , the persistent call of a cuckoo clock or the silvery tones of daughter Jessica 's flute . The sole human occupant of her tidy work space , Eckert enjoys the company of creatures of her own imagining . They smile upon her as they await the attaching of a delicate wing or affixing of a beady eye . Securing that single bead is the final step in constructing an animal . " They seem to come alive when the eyes go on , " confesses their maker . Eckert 's command of color , stemming from her early training as a painter in the mid-6os at Arizona State University , is apparent in the muted jewel-tones of completed works and the exuberant ink-and-colored  --  pencil sketches that line the wall above her desk . Like a cloistered medieval weaver , Eckert uses these sketches as " cartoons " to check contours , correct hues or confirm dimensions . She works upon several objects at a time , constructing each one section by section , laying individual bits atop the cartoon , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strives to work every day . Her piecemeal approach and chosen medium , she explains , arose out of necessity when her children were small , and she struggled to combine the making of art with motherhood.At that busy time , she remembers , fiber-a medium in which she is self-taught-was easier than paint or clay to " pick up and put down . " Now , with her family nearly grown , she can spend long hours in her studio , losing herself in a reverie where time stands still . Her exacting craft is " very meditative , " she says . Eckert seeks inspiration increasingly from introspection and notes her growing fascination with the soul and its ability to transcend time and place . " This is not religious work , " she says , " but I hope it is spiritual . " She enjoys producing personal works tied neither to the 1990s northe American Southwest . Seeking the timeless and universal , she avoid strends and uses only archival materials and techniques that she believes will enable her work to endure . " I want people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eckert anticipates incorporating movement into the staff and sceptor pieces . And she contemplates constructing wearable works-akin to chieftains ' headdresses . " My favorite piece , " she says with a smile , " is always the next one . " Regardless of the form it takes , Carol Eckert , who defines herself as a nontraditional basket maker , will remain true to her " very ancient " technique , coiling row upon tiny row , as she sits curled up in her wicker chair , with the cuckoo clock marking time just beyond her studio door . Asolo exhibition of Carol Eckert 's work is at Materia /The Hand &the; Spirit , Scottsdale , Arizona , April 1-3o . Author Affiliation Bevery K.
