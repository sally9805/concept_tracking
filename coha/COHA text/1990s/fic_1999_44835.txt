Nick DiChario 's last appearance here was back in 1994 with " Drainage . " His short stories have previously been nominated for the Hugo and World Fantasy Awards , and have appeared recently in a variety of anthologies . He notes that this story grew out of his feelings as he watched the news reveal the horrors of war  --  ravaged Bosnia . Back to mind came all those people who said the atrocities of Nazi Germany " could never happen again . " This story , says Nick , is for the victims who even in death refuse to be ignored . <p> IN SARAJEVO , AT RADE Koncar Square , Ahmo watched a young boy fall to the bullet of a sniper . The shell blasted into the boy 's left ear and exploded out his jaw . The spurt of blood and chunk of meat and bone that was once his delicate , rounded chin burst into the air like a champagne cork . His body collapsed and his neck twisted grotesquely underneath him . This was one of the first things Ahmo saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to believe his eyes . The boy , for all his ghostly appearance , died his perpetual deaths in exquisite detail : His bruised left elbow hitched against his ribs . The dull olive color of his tom shirt flapped airily in the breeze . A look of utter confusion crossed his face as the bullet introduced itself as smooth as an ice pick to tender skin and fragile bone . Even the dust settled around the boy 's broken body as it must have done a century ago , captured by the extravagant miracle of his never-ending death . The boy died with his eyes open , questioning , as if there was something about the entire experience he 'd just plain misunderstood . " Excuse me , sir , " a smartbot said in metallic English , rolling toward Ahmo on two trim wheels . " Should I call medical assistance for you ? " It was an outdated model , short and broad-framed , with arms like brass sticks . It had a square head , no neck , and an old RetnaNet scanner strip for visuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it asked in its scratchy voice . " Do I presume correctly ? " Ahmo felt the summer heat closing in on him . It was a bright afternoon , and there was nowhere to hide from the sun . He must have looked very pale . " I 'm all right , " he said . " Very good . Will you please accept reading material from the Sarajevo Council on Spiritual Awareness ? " The smartbot had a stack of pamphlets tucked under its stiff arm . It pinched one of the pamphlets with its adept robotic fingers and held it out to him . " By the grace of Allah , you are allowed to tread upon this Holy Soil . Allah offers the Miracle of Ghosts to all people who-ssschkitch - travel to Sarajevo . The ghosts are prophets of Allah sent to remind us never to forsake peace . Peace with Allah , peace with one 's soul , peace with each other and all living things is paramount . The people of the world are guilty of turning their backs on Sarajevo , but Allah will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily forget . Read this pamphlet , please . " " I 'll read it . " Ahmo folded the paper into his pocket . " Sir , are you planning to visit Vase Miskin Street and the infamous Bread Queue Massacre ? " " Dobrinja , " Ahmo answered . " If you pass the BQM , maybe it is best for you to - skeeeeeech close eyes . You do not look so good . " The smartbot rolled away toward a group of Eastern Indian tourists on the other side of the square . The machine was right about Miskin Street . Hundreds of ghosts gathered outside what was , during the siege on Sarajevo , the city 's only working bakery . On the morning of the massacre , the people came in hopes of buying a loaf of bread for their families with what little money they had . Ahmo knew from what his grandmother had told him that the people had no food , no water , no electricity , their telephones had all been cut off . They suffered the indignity of inadequate sanitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or vegetables for many months . They survived on bread and rain water and what little rice they received from humanitarian aid . The grenades exploded in the center of the crowd . Arms and legs were thrown into the air , landed on nearby balconies . Blood flowed down Vase Miskin Street . This was Sarajevo in the year 1992 , and 2092 , and all the years inbetween . Welcome . Ahmo stepped into the shadows of a decrepit building of worn and crumbling Jerusalem stone . He wiped the sweat from his face with a bandanna already dampened by perspiration . He dug in his pocket , unfolded the pamphlet the smartbot had given him , and read a quote from the Holy Qur'an : ... Men began to fear the strong and oppress the weak , To boast in prosperity , and curse in adversity . And to flee each other , pursuing phantoms , For the truth and reality of Unity Was gone from their minds . " Ahmo wanted nothing more than for the truth and reality of this horrible place to be gone from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd come . He 'd come for his beloved grandmother . He 'd made her a promise he would not break . He reached in his hip pack for the gold ring Grandmother Ivana had given him on the day she 'd died , felt it at his fingertips , brought it to his lips . " Soon , " he whispered . " Soon I will take you home . " Ahmo stepped out of the shadows and walked toward the suburb of Dobrinja , where Grandmother Ivana had lived when she was just a little girl . Ahmo rushed into his grandparents " small brownstone on the outskirts of Greenwich . He was late for Grandmother Ivana 's death . He had n't meant to be late , but the tube from East Jersey had stalled twice , and the demonstration against new government regulations on webnet virtuware had drawn thousands , clogging up eight blocks of prime downtown real estate . Miss March placed what looked like a hard-plastic fishing creel on the end table . She snapped it open and removed some needles wrapped in white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spent so much of his time since the rest of his family had moved north . The antique poster on the wall from the 1984 Olympics in Sarajevo glinted in its burnished frame . His parents had bought it at an auction and had given it to Ivana on her one hundredth birthday . He 'd often caught his grandmother staring at it , appearing as if she might cry . He touched the large , round area-rug at his knees that he and his sister had helped Grandmother Ivana braid and sew when they were just children . Ahmo suddenly wished he 'd gotten stuck in the tube , or lost in the crowd downtown . Anything , anything other than this . Ivana cupped Ahmo 's chin and gently pulled him closer . She kissed his forehead . She had the most beautiful plum-colored eyes he 'd ever seen . They appeared liquid and hypnotic , like wine . Ahmo could n't imagine no longer having those eyes to look into for warmth , for comfort , for his own sense of family and personal history . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mean so much . " Ahmo , " she said , " what are you holding on to ? I 'm happy . I 'm free to say , this is how I want to die . Do you understand ? " Ahmo understood , but he could not embrace it . His love was too strong . Ivana brushed her fingers through his coarse hair . " Listen to me . I have something important to ask of you . A last request . Will you promise to do something for me after I 'm gone ? " " Of course . Anything . " Ahmo kissed his grandmother 's fingers . Her palms were clammy . He noticed that he 'd been trying to warm her hands with his own , caressing them as if they were sticks he might alight by rubbing them briskly together . " I want you to go back . I want you to go back to Sarajevo for me . " " Go back ? Oh , Grandmother , I , I do n't know ... Sarajevo ... " " Please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have set aside the money for the trip . It will cost you nothing but your time . " Ahmo hesitated . He did not relish the thought of seeing the Miracle of Ghosts , of watching his ancestors die their horrible deaths . " It 's all right , Ahmo , " said his grandmother . The young woman smoothed her woolen jacket . " I do n't believe we 've met , " she said . Grandmother said , " Miss March , this is my grandson , Ahmo . He 'll be your second witness . Ahmo , this is Miss March . She 's single . " Miss March smiled . " The pleasure is all mine . " She had the sort of pinched face that made a smile look pained and exaggerated . She smelled too strongly of powdery perfume , putting Ahmo in mind of the funeral homes her clients were one step away from . He said , " I 'm glad you can find some pleasure in this . " His grandmother frowned . " Ahmo , do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know I want this or she would n't be here . " " I know , but that does n't mean I want it . " Ahmo knelt beside his grandmother and held her hand . " Ca n't I talk you out of this ? " " Stubborn boy , just like your grandfather . We 've been all through this . I 'm one hundred twelve years old and modem medicine has run out of miracles for me . It 's time for me to go . " " Time to go ! Time to go ! " snapped Grandfather . He stormed into the kitchen . " That 's all you 've said for the past three months . Go then . Get it over ! " Ivana smiled . " You 'll watch out for your grandfather when I 'm gone , wo n't you , Ahmo ? He 's not so young anymore . " " Of course I will , " Ahmo answered uneasily . He knew Grandmother Ivana was ready to die . She had made all of the preparations with Hemlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even thought to make Ahmo executor of her estate , whatever that meant to a woman who coveted so few possessions . But Ahmo was not ready to let her go . He thought about his family . Ahmo 's parents , along with his sister and brother-in-law and their three children , lived a long way off , in George Washington Province , the new American colony in Canada . They would be angry when they learned of Ivana 's passing . They would want to know why Ahmo had n't notified them sooner . It was Grandmother 's wish , he would tell them . She had not wanted anyone else to watch her die . " It 's time ! It 's time ! " Grandfather hollered from the kitchen . " Let her go ! " " I ca n't wait around here all afternoon , " said the Hemlock technologist , a petite young woman with a stiff posture aimed at Ahmo 's grandfather . She wore a gray blazer , tight skirt , and a pair of black pumps that made her feet look large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six o'clock . " Grandfather 's face turned crimson . " We pay Hemlock advance for job , you are going to do job . Or else you refund money . All of money ! " He smacked his hands together . Grandmother Ivana smiled up at Ahmo from the quilted sofa . In spite of all her sickness , she looked beautiful . She wore a long , silky , agate-blue wrap over an ivory-colored gown . She 'd primped her hair , and Ahmo could see a trace of makeup on her blanched face . She was not even shaking much today . Ahmo took a moment to savor this picture of her . The Hemlock lady noticed Ahmo standing just inside the parlor . " Is this the young man we 've been waiting for ? " The woman 's voice no longer sounded quite so tart . Not many women could remain angry around Ahmo . He had what his grandmother called " pouty little lips " and a baby boy 's complexion . He 'd inherited his mother 's long , thin face and thick black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ahmo had developed a lean and muscular physique from his years of high school and collegiate basketball ; and his job as assistant basketball coach at East Jersey University kept him fit and trim . The fact that he was an English Lit intern , teaching under a highly respected professor at the university , was something he kept to himself until he met a woman impressed by such things , a rare occurrence in his social circles that still revolved mainly around basketball and his not-so-mature college buddies . " Ahmo , " said his grandmother , " I knew you would come . " She spoke to Ahmo as if no one else were in the room . His grandmother had always talked to him this way , even when he was a child . She 'd always made him feel special . Ahmo was almost thirty years old now and still had n't found anyone else who could do that for him . There were plenty of women who wanted his body , and vice versa to be sure , but special was hard to come by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want Grandmother Ivana to go through with the euthanasia . Selfish , but true . " I 'm sorry I 'm late , " he said , not really meaning it . " It was n't my fault . The tube stalled , and the demonstration downtown- " " Your mother will never go back . She 's afraid . I ca n't blame her . Maybe she 's too close to it . " What choice did Ahmo have ? How could he say no to this beautiful woman , his precious grandmother ? This was her last wish . " All right , I 'll go if it 's that important to you . " Ivana lifted her left hand and removed the gold ring from around her finger . She placed the ring in Ahmo 's hand . " Take this ring and bring it to Dobrinja , bring it to my home . I have all the information written out for you , with a map . When you get there , just leave the ring on the ground . That 's all I ask . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to return it . This is my dying wish . " Ivana 's lips quivered , her delicate jaw trembled , her eyes filled with tears . " Oh , look at me . I promised I would n't cry . " " I hate to sound all business , " said Miss March , " but I 'll need Ahmo to sign the witness statement now . " She said this to no one in particular , but Ahmo took it as a blow to his heart . " All right . " He stood and quickly signed the paper without reading it . He did not want to linger over this task . He felt as if he were signing his grandmother 's death sentence . " Is it done yet ? " Grandfather yelled from the kitchen . " Are you dead yet , Ivana ? " Ivana laughed nervously and brushed away her tears . " No , not yet . Make a pot of coffee . By the time it 's perked I 'll be dead . Make decaffeinated . You 'll be up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're out of decaf ! " he shouted . " I put it on the list but you never bought it . " " I bought it . Look in the refrigerator behind the pickles . How are you going to live without me ? Tomorrow I wo n't be around to tell you where to find things . " Then she looked into Ahmo 's eyes . " Cuvajte se , little Ahmo , take care of yourself . I love you with all my heart . " Ahmo clutched the ring in his hand , and stepped behind the sofa , where Grandmother Ivana could not see his pain . Ahmo walked past " sniper alley " in Sarajevo , and watched an ambulance driver lose control of his vehicle after he 'd been shot in the neck . The ambulance spun out of control , flipped over , and crashed silently into a caf6 . The injured victims in the ambulance spilled out onto the street like lumber from a broken sheaf . Outside the general headquarters of UNPROFOR , the United Nations Protection Force , a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught in the flames of a Molotov cocktail . She was most likely killed by a Chetnik guerrilla . The Chetniks took great pleasure in the killing of volunteers , women , and children . The sky was cloudless , the sun beat down mercilessly . Ahmo 's eyes stung and his mouth felt sandy from the blowing dust . He could feel the skin on the back of his neck beginning to sunburn . He walked the road between Butmir and Dobrinja . The southwest was one of the hardest hit in all of Sarajevo during the war . There were no trees or mountain ranges to protect it . At the old airport , Hercules airplanes packed with medical relief and rice and beans from the West came under heavy anti-aircraft fire , and crashed one after another as they attempted to land . There was a phosphorescent gleam to their aerial distress that made the sky itself look drunk and confused . Ahmo watched for a while , and began to wonder if these tired old airplanes were fed up with crashing and burning over and over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set down safely . Had Allah truly asked them to do this great thing , to make this sacrifice ? Haunt Sarajevo ! Ahmo imagined Allah commanding , and then he saw thousands of Sarajevans , legions of the dead , spirit-zombies , obeying their one true God . A smartbot from the Bureau of Tourism approached Ahmo as he stood in front of the airport . It said , " Slovak ? English ? Deutsch ? Italiano ? Francais ? Espanol ? - " " English , " Ahmo interrupted . " Good day , sir , " it began without pause . " Do you know what started all the killing in Sarajevo ? Do you know the details behind the Bosnia  --  Herzegovina vote for independence from the Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia , and how the Serbian Democratic Party violently disagreed ? Would you like to learn the truth about the evil war criminals Milosevic and Karadzic and their policies of ethnic cleansing and genocide ? " This smartbot was tall and thin , a newer model sporting copper alloy legs and knee joints , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an exoskeleton the color of almond , giving it the appearance of a walking corpse . The " bot was wearing a navy-blue smock with an official patch on its breast , and holding a neatly wrapped computer virtuware package in its dull , brass hand . It clicked and hummed forward . " Why did the Europeans and Americans , the holy and righteous people of the civilized world who prided themselves on their humanitarianism , allow the slaughter of innocent victims when they could have easily put an end to it ? Why was this peaceful city allowed to degenerate into the world 's largest concentration camp ? You can learn all about it from this commemorative Sarajevo virtuware , the only presentation package sanctioned by the Sarajevo Historical Society . " Ahmo looked past the smartbot . Another aircraft spun out of control on the runway , tipped over , and snapped a wing . A fiery mushroom of bleached smoke consumed the plane . " Walk the streets of Sarajevo , the City of Tolerance , before it was completely destroyed by the war and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Muslims , Catholics , and even the Serbs lived in peace for centuries , side by side . See exclusive interviews with Sarajevans who miraculously escaped the violence . Hear theories from internationally renowned mystagogues on why the hauntings continue to transpire . All of this can be yours for only two thousand dinars , the same amount of money it once cost for one-half kilo of macaroni here in Sarajevo during the terrible war of aggression ! " Ahmo donated the money to the Historical Society in German Deutchmarks , the preferred tender in the Balkan region , but told the smartbot he did not have the stomach for its virtuware . In Dobrinja , there was nothing left but collapsed mosques and synagogues , ruined minarets and housing complexes , and ghosts forever dying . Ahmo was swiftly learning to ignore them , just as the world had learned to ignore the real thing so many years ago . But Ahmo felt as if he had earned this right . He was one of them now , under siege with the incendiaries , mortars , cannons , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere ... dancing ... dancing ... So many had died here that the phantoms expired in paranormal heaps , creating numinous silhouettes of multiple executions , of blood and brains and entrails superimposed over tom flesh , exposed bone , and silently screaming faces - a macabre choreography of vision and light , transparency and color , life and death . There was an absurd , mythical quality to all of it that was just now beginning to take shape in his mind , a fuzzy surrealism , a sense of floating adrift in a psychotic nightmare that neither permitted him to succumb to its terrors , nor played itself out of its own accord . Ahmo was nothing more than a prisoner waiting to be set free from Sarajevo , this land of restless , tortured spirits . Finally it was the ring , of all things , the ring burning in Ahmo 's hand that released him , centered him , made him remember who and what he was and why he was there . Somehow Grandmother Ivana 's ring had gotten from his hip pack into the palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate band of gold , he might very well have become a ghost himself . By the time Ahmo found his grandmother 's building , he was both mentally and physically exhausted . He felt the hot wind on his face . Sweat streamed down his ribs . He sipped water from the canteen he 'd purchased in the gift shop at the Sarajevo Marriott . He wanted only to fulfill his promise and be gone . Ahmo watched a family blown to literal bits in his grandmother 's old building . At first they were just sitting there . Then a little girl ran into the room . The bomb hit and the room caved in on them . The little girl looked so much like his grandmother that Ahmo watched the scene unfold again and again , trying to peer through the other ghosts and study her face . His grandmother had been one of the lucky children . She 'd gotten out before the winter , before temperatures of below zero forced people to burn furniture in their stoves to keep from freezing . When the mortar fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her family had died but she 'd survived with only minor cuts and bruises and some ringing in her ears that would not clear for many months . The day after the bombing , a delegation from The Children 's Embassy spirited her away among a group of Italian journalists . From there she 'd been placed in an American home . This girl 's resemblance to Ahmo 's grandmother was uncanny - the structure of her cheeks and the curvature of her jaw , the delicate nose and lofty forehead , the upturned lips and small mouth . Ahmo had heard that as people grew older they began to resemble their childhood likenesses . Perhaps this thought moved him forward . The ghost of the young girl glanced in his direction , and Ahmo saw clearly , for the first time in this hauntingly familiar child , his grandmother Ivana 's dark , plum eyes . No . It was not possible . His grandmother had escaped to America . She could not have been killed in Sarajevo . Perhaps this was a cousin , or even a sister he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died in this building ? It was so long ago . Perhaps Ahmo was beginning to see ghosts of his own design on top of ghosts on top of ghosts . Whatever it was , he 'd had enough . He could not take the sight of any more death . He placed the gold ring on the ground , among the ruins , just as Grandmother Ivana had instructed him to do . He was ashamed to admit that he was glad to be rid of it . He turned his back on the building and strode away . But something stopped him . Ahmo could not say what . He turned around to look one last time at the young girl who had died her horrible death over and over again in this building , her eternal coffin . But on this occasion something very different happened . The girl did not go running into the room . She stopped short . Her beautiful wine  --  colored eyes caught a golden wink in the summer sunlight on the ground where Ahmo had laid his grandmother 's ring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle of yellow light . The grenade struck again , but this time the girl was not in the room . This time she was thrown out onto the street . She rolled across the pavement , almost to Ahmo 's feet , and began to cry . She was alive ! And then the scene faded . The little girl vanished . She no longer lay crying on the street ; she longer appeared in the ghostly reincarnation of her family 's death . She was not anywhere . Ahmo walked back to the place where he 'd dropped Grandmother Ivana 's ring . It was gone . His grandmother 's ring was gone . Ahmo sat on the quilted sofa and cradled Ivana 's head and shoulders . She was so light her spirit might have already fled her body . It had been six minutes since the Hemlock technologist , Miss March , had administered the fatal injection . Miss March said it would take no more than ten minutes for his grandmother to die , for the Seconal and Lace to furnish her a painless , peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she smiled thinly , and whispered , " Ahmo . " " I 'm here , Grandmother . " " Have I ever told you how fortunate I was to survive Sarajevo ? Not so many people were lucky like me . " Her voice was very weak . " You were meant to live , " Ahmo whispered in her ear . He gently squeezed his grandmother 's shoulders , as if his hands held the power to keep her forever by his side . " Sometimes I dream of Sarajevo , " she said , " but in my dreams it is always beautiful and peaceful . No one is afraid . I am with my family . We are all alive and happy . Is n't that nice , Ahmo ? It was strange when the bomb hit our home . I was running to my mother , but then I saw a light , just a twinkle of light , and I thought it was Allah calling me . " His grandmother had not mentioned Allah in many years . Ahmo 's family had given up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had followed his parents in having no particular religious associations . He wished now that it was not so . It would have been nice to have a god to pray to at a time like this , a god who cared . " I can see that light again , Ahmo , " she said . " I can see it . A twinkle .. just a twinkle ... far off .. calling me ... " Ahmo forced himself to smile through his tears . He gripped the ring in the palm of his hand and thought of Sarajevo . For some reason the journey no longer frightened him . Grandmother Ivana had made him feel special one last time .
