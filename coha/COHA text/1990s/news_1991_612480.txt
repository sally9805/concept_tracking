<p> They are mighty humble tools for changing lives : some plastic farm animals , a few well-worn storybooks , a simple puzzle and a stack of pennies . <p> But armed with these ordinary objects , a cadre of West Georgia educators is trying to instill in very young children the attentiveness they 'll need on the first day of kindergarten - convinced it could mean the difference between a rewarding education and a lifetime of discouragement . <p> Never before have Georgia schools begun their efforts so early , reaching out to would-be graduates when they are only 2 , 3 , or 4 years old . <p> The Carrollton school system operates an all-day prekindergarten program for low-income 4-year-olds and sends teachers to work with 3-year- olds and their parents , both at school and in their homes . <p> Just to the north , educators in a joint Bremen-Haralson County program work with low-achieving preschoolers wherever they are found : in private preschools or day-care centers , in a new center started as part of the project or at home with their families . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the longest- running efforts by any Georgia school system to give children a boost before kindergarten . <p> Both rely on deceptively simple techniques : Teachers engage youngsters in non-stop conversation - reading to them , asking them questions , getting them to count and sing and shout . Both have drafted parents and have reveled in the payoffs . <p> With little fanfare , both are making significant strides toward a goal that President Bush and the nation 's governors put first : ensuring that all children start school ready to learn . <p> Settled comfortably in the sun-drenched living room of his tidy mobile home , 3-year-old Justin Williams is n't worried about any national education campaign , and he thinks nothing of the fact that the local public school has come to meet him on his home turf years before he enters kindergarten . <p> For the moment , all his concentration is on getting a big wooden puzzle piece into its proper place . <p> Initially shy and distracted , he 's come to look forward to his weekly visits from Bremen preschool coordinator Anne Chaffin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Melinda Williams beams with new-found pride as her son handily glides the puzzle piece into its slot and signals that he recognizes its distinctive outline : " Helicopter ! " <p> " I just wish more people knew about programs like this , " marvels the mother of six , who says she was " tickled to death " when Mrs. Chaffin asked to cross the once-sacrosanct line between school and home . " Some children need more of a head start than others their age . She makes it fun for Justin to learn , and I love to see him able to do this . " <p> The aim of the Carrollton and Bremen-Haralson programs is daunting : to get those children who are most likely to founder in kindergarten and fall further behind each year to instead start school on solid footing . <p> If the gap that separates children who are behind the curve from those who are primed for learning can be closed before formal schooling begins , the reasoning is , then perhaps the gap will stay closed - or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as insurmountable and give up . <p> The two programs serve children with slightly different qualifications , but the youngsters share traits likely to hamper their success in kindergarten . They do n't talk much ; they have n't visited a full complement of museums , stores , zoos and parks ; they 're not self- confident ; and they do n't know the routines of learning in a big group - when to pay attention , how to stand in line , the need to take turns . <p> Some , but not all , have a biological basis for their delayed development . <p> No matter its source , the gap can be closed , the teachers say . <p> " Of course we believe it 's possible , or we would n't be able to keep trying , " Mrs. Chaffin says. ; Drawing a blank <p> Before Carrollton 's 4-year-olds visited the bank near their school last week , the youngsters could n't say for sure what they 'd see there . " Balloons ? " one suggested . " Paper ? " another offered . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched $ 10,000 worth of $ 100 bills - the children can blurt out just what banks have : " Money ! " <p> And the hands-on lessons stick . <p> Although they are among the poorest and supposedly least academically able in town , these 4-year-olds can tell you in a heartbeat which two colors combine to yield orange . The secret to their impressive expertise ? Let 's just say that when they ate hotdogs for lunch recently , their teachers did n't stop them from messing in the mustard and ketchup . <p> Politicians like Mr. Bush , who declared school readiness Goal One on the national education agenda , ca n't pinpoint what they mean by " ready to learn . " <p> But those who work with young children say they know - and it has surprisingly little to do with who has memorized the alphabet , learned all their colors and mastered counting to 10 . <p> Teachers look for an easy familiarity with spoken language - a child who 'll initiate a conversation rather than remain silent or give one-word answers . What matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attuned to listen and learn . <p> " The key is developing their attention span , " says Linda Bohannan , lead teacher in Carrollton 's preschool program . " They learn that they can sit and fully listen to a story and follow directions . If they can do the attention span by the time they start kindergarten , they 're there . " ; Showing results <p> Children who start kindergarten without proper preparation face an uphill battle . While classmates forge ahead , they are apt to become discipline problems , be placed into special education classes or repeat kindergarten . <p> Evidence shows the West Georgia programs can dramatically reduce such problems . <p> Although youngsters in the Bremen-Haralson program are selected because they appear destined for special education classes , most get placed in regular kindergartens and first grades , said Jim Boyd , Bremen schools ' director of special projects . <p> The first group of 4-year-olds to go through Carrollton 's preschool program was carefully compared to a matching group of low-income children who did n't enroll . The preschool group scored at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 66th percentile for the control group . None of the youngsters who went through the program required special education services , while 40 percent of their counterparts did . <p> Still , these programs and the handful like them in Waycross , Savannah , Dade County and elsewhere , reach only a tiny fraction of the preschoolers who need an extra boost . State officials estimate that 30,000 of Georgia 's 100,000 kindergartners start school less than fully prepared . <p> Gov . Zell Miller says one of his top priorities is to start free prekindergarten programs much like West Georgia 's in all parts of the state , offering both school-based programs and outreach to parents in their homes . But faced with state budget problems , he scratched plans to start the effort on a limited basis this fall . <p> He 's pledging to launch a dozen pilot versions next year and spread them statewide by 1993-94 , using an estimated $ 75 million a year in lottery revenues to pay the bill . <p> " Of all the things that I talk about in education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's No. 1 among the national goals , and it should be . The preschool years are absolutely crucial to the formation of a child and his intellectual development . <p> " By age 5 , it 's almost too late . "
