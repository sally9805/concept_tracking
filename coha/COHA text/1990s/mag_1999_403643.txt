In an exclusive excerpt from her new book , Ladies First , Queen Latifah explains why every woman deserves the royal treatment . // I am not a psychologist or a sociologist . I do n't have any degrees , and I 'm not an expert on life . What I am is a young black woman from the inner city who is making it , despite the odds , despite the obstacles I 've had to face . I have lived in the projects and in fine homes . I have hung out with drug dealers and Presidents . I have had to clean bathrooms for a living and I 've had my own maid . I have sold millions of records and won a Grammy . I 've made movies that have bombed . I 've had to bury my big brother . And I 've also wanted to die myself . I 've felt like the absolute lowest piece of scum on the Earth and I 've also felt on top of the world . Through it all , though , I never forgot who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a queen . Your Majesty Each of us has a queen inside . She was placed there before we were even formed in the womb . It 's just a matter of bringing her out . Just being a woman puts you halfway there . But there 's so much more . Queenliness starts with feeling good about yourself . A queen has high self-esteem . She is proud of who she is , whether she is a corporate executive or a cleaning lady , whether she 's an athlete or a housewife . She knows right from wrong and strives to do her best . She does n't put other women down . Some women have a tendency to be catty or jealous of what other women are doing or what they might have . But a real queen is so intent on raising herself up that she can be sincerely proud of what her sisters are doing . A queen stays on her own path , follows her own rules-these are mine : LATIFAH 'S FIRST LAW Walk proud Others wo n't respect you if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk around with your head down , you are telling the world that you lack confidence , and that can signal to people that you are a target , that you will let people take advantage of you . You 'd be amazed at how changing your body language and lifting your head can give you a whole new perspective on life . It 's hard to feel bad with your head held high . LATIFAH 'S SECOND LAW Master disaster A queen handles adversity with grace . Life will put you through plenty of tests and throw many obstacles your way , but it 's how you pass those tests and overcome those obstacles that makes you a queen . Think of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis . Remember those pictures of her at President Kennedy 's funeral , holding the little hands of Caroline and baby John John ? Just days before , she had witnessed the assassination of her children 's father , her husband . She could not have felt anything but pain too immense to put into words . Yet there she was , giving strength to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to represent something higher than herself . She was a champion . And in many ways , she was the closest thing this country has ever had to a queen . She is remembered not for her extreme wealth and jewels of her exquisite taste-although that was very much a part of who she was-but for her rich character , for her generosity and charity . And for always holding her head up high . LATIFAH 'S THIRD LAW Look inside We live in a society that tells us-promises us-that material things breed contentment . If you possess and own , if you satisfy your desires , then you will be happy . But if you do n't have the right car or the right clothes , you are pitiful . If you do n't have a lot of money , you 're weak . And if you do n't have a man , you 're not a complete woman . So we run after possessions and people as if our whole beings depend on things outside ourselves . Photograph Holding court : Queen Latifah calls the shots . // But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside of you . There is n't a deal , a contract , a car , a bank account , or a promise that can mend a broken heart or make you believe in yourself . LATIFAH 'S FOURTH LAW Face your fear Once you realize what you can do and who you are , you can relax in the confidence of being yourself But you ca n't find out who you are and what you 're made of if you 're too afraid to look hard at yourself . Being a queen does n't mean that you never feel lonely or ugly or afraid . I 'm afraid all the time . I 'm afraid of being alone . I 'm afraid of commitment . I 'm afraid of becoming someone I 'm not in the music business . I 'm afraid of not having a child before I get too old . But none of these fears rules my life . Fear is a breeding ground for fear . If you do n't control it , it will control you . LATIFAH 'S FIFTH LAW Control yourself Power is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to rule others but to reign over yourself Do n't confuse having power with controlling every situation in your life . You can only control the way you respond to situations ; you ca n't control the events around you . There is plenty in life that our power ca n't touch . When my 24-year-old brother died in a motorcycle accident 7 years ago , it was the most painful , tragic thing ever to come into my life . For the longest time , I threw my energy into wanting to bring him back . I wanted my mother to heal . I wanted peace for my father . I could n't stop the pain . But the time of my brother 's death was also a period of intense evolution for me . Sitting in church a year after his death , I achieved a milestone . I had carried onlived , loved , and made an award-winning album-through , and because of , the unimaginable pain I felt inside . I take nothing for granted anymore . I am grateful for every blessing in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter what car you drive , no matter what happens to you , you can be everything you nourish her , praise her , hold her accountable , and love her . Become her . // Long Live the Queen ! Latifah 's Reign Author Affiliation Adapted from LADIES FIRST . <p>
