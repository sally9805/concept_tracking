<p> He did n't tunnel through 6 miles of mountain rock , build an airport or deliver the gush of fresh water that sprouted a foothills metropolis . <p> He had little to do with the Rocky Mountain skiing boom , even less to do with the brewing of a home-grown brand of beer . He did n't even win us a Super Bowl . <p> What he did was take a stand . <p> In one of America 's darkest hours , he defended humanity and decency , a move that cost him a career and sent ripples of goodwill rolling through Colorado for years . And his call for compassion resonates even more crisply today - in the emotional vapor trail of Columbine . <p> Style over substance <p> In the last 100 years , industrial titans and business tycoons gave Colorado rail lines and runways , jobs and technology , mountain parks and baseball parks . They did good . They built a state . But when it comes to selecting Colorado 's ' Person of the Century , ' The Denver Post chooses style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ralph Carr . <p> ' The man who stands for more than a tunnel or an airport is the man who stands for the dignity of a human being , ' says David Halaas , the state 's chief historian . ' I 'd put Governor Carr right at the top . ' <p> He had been Colorado 's governor for four years when , in 1942 , he broke ranks with every politician in the land and denounced the herding of Japanese Americans into 10 prison camps , including one near Lamar . Then , with anti-Japanese fervor flying and World War II grinding on , Carr welcomed the involuntary immigrants to stay and live in Colorado . It destroyed his political career , yet made him a hero . <p> ' He 's an inspiration , ' Halaas says . ' And I think that kind of leadership is a leadership we 'll remember for years to come . ' <p> With Time magazine today unveiling its ' Person of the Century , ' The Denver Post decided to ask : Who is Colorado 's leading icon from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dick Lamm , along with a bevy of college professors , historians and journalists . <p> More than a dozen strong nominees came up , including those who influenced the course of Colorado with money and power , or locals who made good - like Apollo 13 astronaut Jack Swigert and former running back and Supreme Court Justice Byron ' Whizzer ' White . <p> But the name mentioned most often was Ralph Carr . <p> ' I think that 's a wonderful one , ' says Lamm , a former governor . ' You have to gauge vision by the context of the time and also by the guts that it took . ' <p> Crowded field <p> ' He shows the best of what we can be , ' adds Halaas , ' and that is rejecting inhumanity to humanity . ' <p> For that , Carr gets the nods from a crowded field of do-gooders , power brokers and visionaries who each enjoyed days in the sun and years in the headlines , whose names live on through public-works projects , pretty parks and sports stadiums . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would opt for the early-century mining magnates and business moguls - like David Moffat and Charles Boettcher - who paved the way for the tangible , brick-and-mortar underpinnings on which the state rests today . <p> And it 's a choice that 's sure to cause others to ask : Who ? <p> ' He 's not known ; he 's obscure , ' Denver historian Tom Noel once said of Carr . ' He 's one of our best and most heroic governors . He was someone who could defy both parties and the conventional wisdom . ' <p> In making their case for Carr , some panelists argued that it was time to change how the so-called ' Person of the Century ' - not to mention ' Of The Millennium ' - is singled out . <p> ' I think we 're looking at the wrong end of the stick when we say this person is great because of the power he had , the power he controlled or the people he employed , ' Halaas says . ' I do n't miss the fact that industrialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' <p> Any way you slice it , this is not an easy task . <p> For starters , the state 's true giants - the men and women who actually molded today 's Colorado - did their deeds in the 1800s . They were the ones who laid the steel rails that linked dusty outposts with cities back east ; who pulled gold and silver out of the mountains to churn a hot new economy ; who sold America on a rugged , pine-scented playground out west with stunning photographs . <p> That was the footing for what the state was become . Those were the pioneers . <p> But the last 100 years have n't offered a clear choice for one towering figure whose shadow still lords over the landscape . It essentially has been a transition century , some historians believe . <p> ' This region was shaped in the 19th century . Those are still the dominant ideals we 're dealing with , ' says Ed Marston , publisher of the High Country News in Paonia . <p> ' And it 's not clear yet what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know yet what kind of people ( now in their heyday ) are most important in shaping the future , ' Marston says . ' We are sad , are n't we ? We do n't have any giants . ' <p> Any 20th century list of great Coloradans has to start with Moffat , a pioneer who built a fortune in mining and banking and parlayed that into the Denver , Northwestern &; Pacific railroad in 1902 . His line reached Steamboat in 1911 and then Moffat died . <p> But other money men extended the line to Craig , and in 1927 - after years of political haggling - took the railroad deep under the Continental Divide in Gilpin County and through the 6.1-mile-long Moffat Tunnel . That put Denver on the main line , connecting east and west . Even better , a second ' pioneer tunnel ' used for ventilation during construction was lined with concrete and now carries up to 827 million gallons of water a day from the Western Slope to the metro area . That fueled Denver 's growth after World War II . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Colorado 's ' Person of the Century . ' They included : <p> Charles Boettcher . He started as a merchant in Leadville , made money selling hardware to silver miners and then took his cash to Denver . There , he started the sugar beat industry along the northern Front Range , the Ideal Cement Co. and a powerful brokerage firm . Ultimately , his family launched the Boettcher Foundation , which has since donated $ 160 million to build hospitals , schools and fund other charities . <p> Josephine Roche . The social reformer was Denver 's first female cop and inherited her father 's stake in the Rocky Mountain Fuel Co. , a coal mining operation . While heading the business earlier this century , she boosted pay and invited the United Mine Workers to organize her employees . Later , she was the second-ranking member of President Franklin Roosevelt 's cabinet and helped bring in the New Deal . <p> Florence Sabin . The daughter of a Central City miner , she was one of America 's top medical researchers in the early part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Academy of Sciences , pioneered new techniques in treating tuberculosis , and later spearheaded a massive reform in Colorado 's health codes - including laws requiring sewage control and the pasteurization of milk . <p> Former U.S. Rep. Wayne Aspinall . Instrumental in uranium mining and nuclear energy , he made his deepest imprints by helping pass the Colorado River Basin Storage Act , which empowered the federal government to build reservoirs at Flaming Gorge , Navajo and Glen Canyon . <p> ' Had the century ended 20 years earlier , we agree that the Man of the Century would have to be Aspinall , ' Marston said after surveying his staff at the High Country News . ' However , his vision did not outlast the 20th century , and today we see that his approach to resources and the land is not the approach we will follow into the 21st century <p> ' In a way , I 'm arguing that the 20th century was a mistake for Colorado . We got distracted from the intrinsic values of the land and went chasing its cash value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice for Lamm , who contends a nation can get along without its leader , but not without its everyday people . <p> ' The genius of America - what holds this country together , the real heroes - are the average citizens , ' says Lamm , who was Colorado governor from 1975 to 1987 . <p> ' What 's important in society is the cumulative work of the many nameless and unsung people who go about their daily lives but at a higher standard where they 're obeying the laws , they 're contributing to their service clubs , they do n't throw trash on the street . They care about things , ' Lamm says . <p> ' Ralph Carr , I mean he was very average but the thing is , he rose to the occassion . ' <p> Born and raised in Colorado mining camps near Cripple Creek , Carr later opened a law office in Antonito . He learned to speak Spanish , the first language among many residents in the San Luis Valley . <p> Chubby and funny , he was drafted as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer . In his very first speech , he told supporters they would have to raise campaign money for his run because he did n't want to know where it came from , recalls his son , who was on hand that day . <p> Carr then added : ' I 'm going to call the shots as I see them and you might not like some of them . ' <p> As World War II erupted , Carr made his stand in the face of patriotism and racism at home : ' We can not test the degree of a man 's affection for his country by the birthplace of his grandfather , ' he told Coloradans in a radio address three days after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor . <p> In a national climate of fear and anger , Carr stood virtually alone in opposing internment camps for Japanese-Americans . Some 120,000 people were shipped across the country - many by railroad car - to 10 scattered compounds , each surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards . <p> The governor openly stoked his controversial stand against the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight out of the internment compound near Lamar called ' Amache . ' <p> It ended a promising political career . <p> In 1942 , he lost a bid for the U.S. Senate to ' Big Ed ' Johnson who used the anti-internment issue against Carr . Johnson earlier had even suggested that Carr deploy the National Guard to block the Japanese-Americans from entering Colorado . The margin victory was just 3,600 votes . Eight years later , while running again for governor , Carr died at age 62 . <p> ' His basic tenet , ' Halaas says , ' was all men are created equal - and he believed it . ' @p#
