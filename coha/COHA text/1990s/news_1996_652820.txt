<p> ONE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER his death , Anton Bruckner is still positioned on the fringe of the American symphonic canon , despite having a loyal core of enthusiasts . When Mahler 's time came in the 1960 's , many believed that Bruckner 's would soon follow , but that moment never quite arrived . Beyond the concert hall , Bruckner was shunned by musicologists and theorists . Mere mention of his name at an academic conference inevitably produced a curled lip or a condescending smile . <p> Musicology has relaxed a bit in recent years , and so , it seems , has the curled lip . One result has been a burst of scholarly interest in Bruckner , with two international conferences in the last two years . Still , public opinion remains heavily influenced by an image of Bruckner fostered by the Nazis , who appropriated him as one of their own in the 1930 's . Scholars have only recently begun to explore this dark chapter in Bruckner 's posthumous career , and how it has affected the way we view his personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the popular perception of Bruckner and his music is inescapably connected to this legacy . The National Socialists made a conscious effort to link Bruckner 's music with the religious aura of Wagner 's Bayreuth , thus deifying both opera house and symphony hall as sacred settings for German music . <p> By exploiting the old cliche of Bruckner as Wagner-symphonist , though with an unprecedented political spin , they gave the symphonies a heightened sense of monumentality , a metaphysical meaning . The opening of Bruckner 's Third Symphony consecrated a massive parade celebrating German art in Munich . Vienna audiences communed with Bruckner symphonies in total darkness during the early 40 's . <p> Old habits die hard , and a residue of the " German " Bruckner may linger in performances today , in the form of solemn , ponderous tempos and a monumental sonic weight and solidity . What tends to be lost in the juxtaposition of Bruckner 's music with Wagner 's is the close relationship it actually bears to the lighter , fleeter style of Schubert , a fellow Austrian . <p> The official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began in 1937 , when National Socialists and members of the International Bruckner Society gathered in Regensburg to consecrate a Bruckner bust installed in the Valhalla , an 1841 replica of the Parthenon , filled with statues commemorating Teutonic cultural heroes . Photographs of the highly publicized event show Adolf Hitler , Joseph Goebbels , Heinrich Himmler and others in full military regalia , gazing reverently at the Bruckner likeness . Hitler was awarded the Bruckner Society 's first medal of honor , and Goebbels delivered a keynote address on the meaning of Bruckner to the new Nazi order . <p> The message of the event was clear . The Austrian Bruckner had been " elevated " to the status of German composer brought into the embrace of the Third Reich , a move that foreshadowed Germany 's annexation of Austria just eight months later . <p> Germany always played a significant role in determining how Bruckner 's music was received , even during his lifetime . Germany , not Austria , gave him the crucial early recognition that galvanized his career in Vienna in the 1880 's . <p> Paradoxically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German Brahms that was synonymous with the values of the Viennese musical establishment . Bruckner 's symphonies were deemed lavish , even incoherent , and their counterpoint was hardly subtle . Curiously , the Austrian Catholic Bruckner remained foreign to his own cultural realm , little more than " a symphonist living in Vienna , " as the English musicologist Paul Banks once observed . But with the premiere of his Seventh Symphony ( in Leipzig , in 1884 ) the tide turned for Bruckner , and he gained his long-awaited fame , first in Germany , then in Austria . <p> The Leipzig Gewandhaus undertook a complete cycle of Bruckner 's symphonies in 1919 , 23 years after his death . But in the wake of German and Austrian military defeat in World War I , this was a time of political and economic instability , of uneasiness with the immediate cultural past . The Bruckner cycle was a painful reminder of the ill-fated era of Emperor Wilhelm II . Younger composers , performers and audiences of the new age of the Weimar Republic rejected the old guard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exploring more remote periods of music and celebrating popular music . Bruckner 's monumental symphonic designs seemed especially anachronistic to Weimar modernists , who had adopted the chamber symphony as the the new orchestral ideal . <p> YET THIS SENSE OF anachronism only enhanced Bruckner 's value for certain antiliberal voices . The composer , though deemed a progressive force at the turn of the century , became an emblem for conservatism during the 20 's . Max Auer , president of the International Bruckner Society , which was founded in Leipzig in 1925 and moved to Vienna in 1929 , decried the " false prophets " of a new age in which materialism and Bolshevism threatened German art . Bruckner 's " divinely consecrated art , " he suggested , could serve as a guide to a better world . <p> During his lifetime , the apolitical Bruckner allowed himself to be supported in part by a dubious pan-Germanic fringe element . It would , however , be a distortion to link him or his music directly with the political goals of that group . Such reactionary views were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , Austria was experiencing a painful crisis of identity . <p> Indeed , during the 20 's , Hitler 's devotion to Bruckner the man , composer and fellow Upper Austrian intensified significantly . Hitler 's involvement with Bruckner 's music dated back to his youth , when , as a young , mediocre painter from Braunau , he tried and failed to enter the Viennese artistic establishment . <p> Hitler made no secret of the solidarity he felt with the rural Bruckner , who , decades earlier , had also found himself outside the Viennese cultural mainstream . In 1941 , Hitler planned to phase Vienna out of the cultural picture and promote Linz , the seat of Upper Austria . St. Florian , the monastery near Linz that had been Bruckner 's spiritual sanctuary , was to be converted into a Bruckner Foundation . This so-called Brucknerian Bayreuth would promote and maintain a Bruckner tradition for the Third Reich . <p> Years before the St. Florian project , which was never fully implemented , the National Socialists sought to exploit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a new military mobilization . Nineteen thirty-six , the 40th anniversary of Bruckner 's death , was also the year the Rhineland was remilitarized . The Nazis devised a three-part propaganda strategy that was woven into Goebbels 's address at the Regensburg Bruckner ceremony in 1937 . <p> First , Bruckner 's Upper Austrian peasant roots were sentimentalized with the familiar naive , " rustic genius " portrayal that persists today . By coupling his " love for his native soil and for the German fatherland " with strong " blood and soil " imagery , Goebbels set forth a cultural rationale for the Austrian Anschluss . <p> Second , the cliche of Bruckner as the small-town " outsider " victimized by a conspiracy of Viennese critics would be exploited in conjunction with Goebbels 's official policy banning art criticism , a field that had allegedly been dominated by cynical , liberal Jews for decades . <p> Third , the image of the devout Bruckner as a " visionary mystic " was exploited after the breakdown of relations between Berlin and the Vatican in 1936 . The National Socialists formulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " Gottglaubig " ) , which recognized German nationalist identity as a religion in itself . Bruckner 's symphonies were to be its sacred language , though his important religious works and , indeed , the very identity of Bruckner as Catholic had to be ignored . The symphonies , especially the slow movements , which surpassed even Schubert 's heavenly lengths , were deemed a religious experience , and only those who shared the same blood and soil could fully comprehend the message . <p> So it is no coincidence that only hours after the Regensburg ceremony Hitler used the word " Gottglaubig " for the first time at a large political rally , cleverly connecting a National Socialist religion with German expansionism . <p> The strong role music played in Nazi politics may strike some as unusual ; contemporary poltical and cultural wars have more to do with sex and violence than with atonality and dissonance . But in the Germany of the 1930 's , music was seen as the most sacred manifestation of what Hans Sachs , in Wagner 's " Meistersinger , " calls " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A remarkable line from Goebbels 's speech promised a " considerable annual contribution to the International Bruckner Society for editions of the original versions of his symphonies , until the master 's complete works are available in the form he envisioned . " Goebbels the politician sounds strangely like a musicologist . But if Bruckner was to assume an oraclelike status for the new Nazi religion , the scores to his symphonies were the sacred texts , and the clear implication was that these texts had been corrupted by outside Jewish influences . <p> Max Auer , the society 's president , who had decried the cultural corruption of the Weimar Republic , described Bruckner 's music as a " return to the pure sources , " and the search for purity formed the ideological basis for the first Bruckner Edition , edited by Robert Haas . That purist legacy , which rejected early printed editions of Bruckner 's works as inauthentic and deemed manuscript sources the only authentic texts for the composer 's music , lingers even today . Only recently have young American and German scholars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this simplistic principle . <p> THE NAZI PROPAGANDA campaign was also fought in German music journals , where a vast body of ideological literature on Bruckner was generated . This literature was all but ignored after World War II , and the code of silence extended even into the Bruckner bibliography in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians , of 1980 . During the years just after the war , articles in German-language journals changed drastically in tone . References to race and soil gave way to editorial problems , documentary studies and analytical issues . Such positivistic concerns offered a refuge for scholars who wished to forget the recent past , but this neglect only extended the Nazi shadow beyond the 12 years of actual dictatorship . <p> Can we now , a half-century later , edit , analyze , perform or listen to Bruckner ignoring the fact that terms like " authenticity , " " purity " and " organicism " were encoded with distinct political meanings ? Could one argue that the Nazi-deified " German " Bruckner , removed from his Austrian heritage and placed alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition ? Have postwar Bruckner interpretations , exemplified by slow tempos and lush sonorities , unwittingly carried over the phenomenon of Bruckner as Nazi religious icon into the contemporary concert hall and recording studio ? <p> Moreover , given this legacy , should n't we re-evaluate the tired notions of Bruckner as " peasant genius , " " visionary mystic , " " Wagner-symphonist , " " insecure neurotic " prone to manipulation by zealous colleagues ? Although each of these labels predated the 1930 's , the political spin imparted by the Nazis continues to resonate . <p> A new generation of scholars has made significant strides in addressing these issues . Decades from now , we may look back to this centennial year as a major turning point toward a proper understanding and just appreciation of a composer who has for too long borne an ideological burden not of his own choosing .
