A large , nearly circular patch of dark ground forms the eastern eye of the Man in the Moon . This is the Sea of Serenity or to give its proper name , Mare Serenitatis . When Franceso Grimaldi named this feature on his early lunar map ( published in 1651 by Giovanni Riccioli ) , he probably knew as most astronomers did even then that these big flat expanses on the Moon were n't really seas of water , but vast plains of rock . Whimsy or not , the naming scheme publicized by Riccioli soon prevailed over rival ones , and thus Mare Serenitatis ended up surrounded by features similarly named . To the south , for example , lies the Sea of Tranquility ( Mare Tranquillitatis ) while the Sea of Rains ( Mare Imbrium ) stands to the west ; flanking it to the northeast is the Lake of Dreams ( Lacus Somniorum ) . The Sea of Serenity really is an appropriate name : Nothing much has happened here since the day 109 million years ago when the Tycho impact splashed a ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16-kilometer crater Bessel . Mare Serenitatis is a sheet of lava rock with about the same area as Arizona or New Mexico . Lunar geologists carefully distinguish the 600-kilometer-wide mare ( pronounced MAH-ray ) from the broad , shallow impact basin it lies within , whose rim spans about 740 km . Scientists think the basin was created by the impact of an asteroid some 3.87 billion years ago , a time in lunar history when big impacts were common . The mare lava , though , is some 150 to 200 million years younger , and its surface has subsided about 3 to 4 km below lunar " sea level , " the Moon 's average radius . The basin rim was once essentially a full circle , but later events ( in particular the Imbrium impact ) broke its continuity . Thus today we see Serenitatis bordered by apparently separate mountain ranges . These are the Caucasus in the north , the Taurus to the east , and the Haemus to the south , which merges into the Imbrium basin 's Apennines on the west . At first glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad expanse of gray . But a closer look reveals many tint variations and topographic features . Around lunar sunrise  --  about five days after New Moon  --  when the terminator ( the line between lunar day and night ) crosses the mare , what strikes your eye most strongly are the patterns of knotted ridges roughly outlining the mare 's circular shape . These lie like wrinkles in the cupped palm of your hand and are in fact called wrinkle ridges . The largest is the so-called Serpentine Ridge , which meanders for 130 km along the mare 's eastern side . Wrinkle ridges result when the mare surface subsides and many betray the locations of buried basin rims or rings . A radar sounder on the Apollo 17 command module showed the bottom of the Serenitatis basin lies 1,500 meters below the mare surface in the west and 2,000 m deep in the east . The radar also revealed that the mare has an internal layer about 1,000 m down . This buried horizon may be evidence that Mare Serenitatis filled in two distinct episodes . As the Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eastern and southern edges have a distinctly darker shade , and that this dark material penetrates a considerable distance into the bordering mountains . Geologists once thought this dark material , which is lava rich in iron and titanium , was younger than the light gray lavas of the mare 's center . But Apollo 17 samples and careful study of the number of craters seen in photos from lunar orbit showed that it is actually older . The largest crater in the south , Plinius , spans 43 km and is 2,300 m deep . Standing in the 100-km-wide " strait " between Serenitatis and Tranquillitatis , Plinius is nicely terraced inside and sports an odd central peak that under sunrise conditions looks like a double crater . Three parallel rilles slice across the dark mare north of Plinius and other sets continue along the shore toward the west . Their curving form ( which parallels the basin rim ) and flat floors suggest they are grabens that cracked open as the mare surface subsided , perhaps under the weight of the brighter lavas that spilled out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 50-km-wide strait chops a path into Mare Imbrium between the Apennine and Caucasus Mountains . Examine the strait under grazing light and you 'll see several so-looking scarps that help trace the underlying basin rim . The history here is tangled . After much study , geolgists think the Serenitatis basin formed first , then an asteroid excavated the Imbrium basin . Only then did the Serenitatis lavas emerge to fill their basin , followed by those of Imbrium . Now use high power and look a short way out into Serenitatis for a tiny ( 2.5 km ) solitary crater . Linne is apparently a fresh impact crater with a bright blanket of ejecta surrounding it . Under most conditions , all you will see of Linne is the bright spot . When 19th-century astronomers confused the ejecta 's diameter with that of the crater itself , they were misled into thinking that Linne had recently changed in size . Alas , too bad for lunar fantasies . As spacecraft photos have shown , Linne , while young in lunar terms , is nonetheless millions of years old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Caucasus Mountains define the northwest rim of the Serenitatis basin . Like the Apennines , these contain pretty tall peaks : up to 6 km above the mare plains . The craters within the mountains  --  33-km Calippus , 67-km Eudoxus , and 87-km Aristoteles  --  postdate the basin-forming impacts and have been extensively modified inside by slumping and pooling of impact-melted rock . In Eudoxus and Aristoteles particularly , impact melt has all but swallowed their central peaks . Collapse of their walls on the inside has left both with intricate networks of terraces and landslides for you to explore by telescope . The Caucasus range also forms the northern shore of Serenitatis . But its arc is broken in the northeast where the mare lavas burst though the basin rim to flood a large region beyond . This is Lacus Somniorum , the Lake of Dreams . Somniorum has a huge area  --  in fact , it 's bounded more by mapmakers ' convention than physical features since it flows on contiguously into Mare Frigoris . Farther to the east , dark lava can be seen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's northeast limb . Lunar geologists call this kind of terrain " cryptomare , " and it 's especially rewarding to hunt for at times of high Sun angle , such as gibbous or Full Moon . ( Use a neutral gray filter to reduce the glare . ) In a telescope , Lacus Somniorum abounds in peaks and crater walls half drowned by lava flows . You can almost write a history of the region yourself by noting the relative state of degradation in its craters . Many small , unnamed craters appear barely altered and are presumably fresh . At the other extreme , Lacus Mortis , the Lake of Death , is so flooded that it no longer deserves the name crater . Lacus Mortis is a ring of peaks 150 km across , marking the topmost rim of an impact crater so ancient that it 's almost obliterated . It must have formed during the millions of years that divided the creation of the Serenitatis basin from its mare infill . The 40-km crater Burg stands in the center of Lacus Mortis , relatively new and startlingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , you 'll see many more faint features whose circularity ( full or partial ) points toward an impact origin obscured by lava floods . On Mare Serenitatis ' eastern shore lies one of the Moon 's most remarkable craters , Posidonius . Over 95 km in diameter and 2,300 m deep , Posidonius once must have been a much deeper pit than it is today . Its floor , which tips gently toward the north , now lies at practically the same level as the adjacent mare . But it differs markedly in color and tint , both of which point to a difference in composition . Multispectral studies from Earth and with spacecraft show that whatever its detailed properties are , the floor of Posidonius shares the spectral characteristics of the Taurus Mountains rather than the nearby mare . Thus it is probably a pool of impact melt derived from the target rocks rather than a portion of mare that seeped into the crater . When conditions allow it , turn the highest power your telescope provides onto Posidonius . You 'll have to look for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often overshadowed by the long ridge that meanders in a spiral path from the inside southeastern wall . Another ridge on the southwestern floor faintly echoes the main one . Most likely the ridges are the top edges of gigantic slump-terraces , with the rest buried by floor material . A network of rilles crisscross the crater floor , popping into view and vanishing again as good seeing comes and goes . Easiest to spot is the long rille that nearly bisects the floor ; several smaller and shallower ones cross it in the southern part of the floor . Posidonius ' companion on the south is the crater Chacornac . Some 50 km across , this is a fairly respectable crater , but it suffers from comparison to its more vivid neighbor . Somehow , Chacornac strikes the observer as old . Its features ( except for 8-km Chacornac A in its center ) look subdued and almost weathered . Several graben rilles slice through the Taurus Mountains here and continue across Chacornac unhindered . Ironically , the crater Le Monnier is in much rougher shape , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mare . Making a deep bay in the mountains , Le Monnier stretches 60 km and was the landing site ( in January 1973 ) for the Soviet Luna 21 probe and its remotely controlled rover Lunakhod 2 . Le Monnier 's floor is featureless , except for a wrinkle ridge across its mouth . No backyard lunar explorer should leave the Sea of Serenity without paying a visit to the little valley where mankind last set foot on the Moon . The Apollo 17 landing site was designated Taurus-Littrow , but the name is n't a lot of help in finding it . Scan south along the shore from Le Monnier , noting the wrinkle ridges and rilles caused by the mare 's subsidence . When you reach Littrow crater ( 30 km across ) , shift to a medium-power eyepiece and look carefully one Littrow-diameter south of the crater , about halfway between Littrow and Vitruvius . The floor of the valley the astronauts landed in is very dark  --  so dark that Full Moon is n't a bad time to look for it . The valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dark mare trapped among the massifs of the Taurus Mountains  --  which is just what it is . Mission planners chose the site hoping the dark color was evidence of recent volcanism . But despite a momentary surge of hope when the astronauts found orange glass on the rim of a small crater , the valley floor basalts proved to be 3.72 billion years old . ( The celebrated glass unfortunately turned out to be old after all . ) A lot more exciting was finding ejecta from the Tycho impact . The fact that Tycho debris landed at Taurus-Littrow , some 2,250 km from the impact site , speaks volumes about the violence of a major crater impact ! ( After one of the much larger basin impacts , such as Serenitatis itself , every part of the Moon must have received at least a light sprinkling of rocks . ) Taurus-Littrow marked an end ; where and when human lunar exploration may recommence is very much a matter of debate . Still , the vast amount of data from the Clementine mission offers much to study and correlate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moon is manifold : It lies nearby in space , so it 's easy to send missions there . And it also lies perfectly within reach of every backyard astronomer . <p>
