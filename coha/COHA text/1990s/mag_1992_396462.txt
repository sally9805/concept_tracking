My father never learned the art of snagging salmon . I realize now that is to his credit , but when I was 17 and suffering from a serious case of bloodlust , it was a matter of some embarrassment . My friends and I had become aficionados of the unadorned treble hook and I had little patience for a man , even my own father , who turned his back on snagging . He preferred to fish alone for walleyes in Long Lake . I lit out to join the snagging crowd on the Boardman River in Traverse City , Michigan . The river had filled suddenly and unexpectedly with so many coho salmon  --  a new and exotic species in our part of the world  --  that everywhere we looked we saw enormous fish porpoising , swirling , leaping clear of the water to land in great side-smacking explosions . It was hardly possible to drag a lure through the water without hooking one . My friends and I , drunk with abundance , figured we could be forgiven if we killed a few more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporarily  --  such concepts as restraint and honor and sportsmanship . It was the beginning of our last year of high school and we were eager to be released to the broad freedoms of adulthood , to college , to life . Every afternoon , the moment the final bell rang , we ran for the parking lot and drove Doug 's rust-shot Torino straight to the river . There , at least , we were equals to anyone . On the water we had already graduated to a bigger world . We recognized many of the cars parked beside the bridge . Other students had skipped school , had been here all day , and would have raked the Willow Hole clean by noon . Below the bridge , the hard-core regulars , the Men , stood in ranks along shore . They crowded each other , their thickets of rods in constant up-and-down motion . They used surfcasting rigs with 30-pound-test line and cast them as if they were heaving anvils in the river . We hurried into our waders , grabbed our spinning rods , and raced down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blackberry brambles , over piles of crumbling yellow bricks and tangles of the discarded monofilament that stretched in coils and snarls from Union Street Dam to the mouth of the river . We busted out onto the riverbank . The pool was deserted . Fishermen were upstream and down  --  we could hear a wailing drag , the crash of a leaping salmon , shouts and oaths and laughter  --  but somehow , this spot , the spot , had been left to us . Doug , careless with knots and other trivial matters , was rigged first . Before he could cast , a large salmon broke the water at midstream ; another swirled close to the bank . Doug tossed his Spider out and across , allowed it to sink the necessary three-count , then began the old jerk-and-haul . " You bozos better hurry , " he said . " Unless you want to watch me catch all the  --  Whoa ! " He was into one already . It ran downstream , his rod skewed low and rigid , the reel shrieking , the line tearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist off the water . Suddenly the fish came up : somer-saulting in its own spray , arcing and flexing , crashing back into the river . It was hooked in the back . Good spot . It gave the fish leverage but did not disable it with pain . We had forgotten the net . Russ and I refused to go back to the car . Doug screamed at us to go but we ignored him . I cast my Spider and let it sink . One-thousand-one , one-thousand-two , one-thousand-three . Wait any less and the hook would be pulled over the tops of the salmon . Wait any longer and it would get wedged in rocks , driven into a log , or tangled permanently in the monster-snarls of line that had been growing like fungus on the bottom since the run began . Yank and reel , sidearm to keep the hook low . Yank and reel . No resistance to speak of , just the No. 2 treble and the quarter-ounce bell sinker streaking through the water . Yank and  --  Whoa ! It ran instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaping before I could warn Doug to watch his line . He had n't landed his 10-pounder yet , and mine , 12 pounds at least , crossed his line and his crossed mine and mine crossed his again . Then the two salmon plowed off in opposite directions and the lines broke almost simultaneously , like rapid-fire gunshots . Doug blamed me , of course . He had a scrub-brush of hair growing straight up from his forehead . He pushed his glasses up on his nose . Russ , meanwhile , cast into the pool ; his first yank was into a fresh-run , eight-pounder that blasted out of the water almost the second the hook bit . Doug , to cool off , left for the car to get the net . I landed Russ ' fish for him , waiting until he led it into shallow water then placing my foot beneath its belly and booting it up onto the bank . When Doug returned with the net , Russ had his fish hung on the stringer in the shallows , and I was into another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was hooked in the absolute maximum leverage point of the tail and I did n't have a chance . It made a V-wake for Lake Michigan and kept going even after my line popped 50 yards downstream , where the fast water began at the Front Street Bridge . The newspapers called it Coho Fever , which set in shortly after the salmon began congregating near the mouth of the Platte River in northwestern lower Michigan in 1967 . This was 18 months after they had been planted by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in an effort to revitalize a Great Lakes fishery that was suffering , to say the least . Once considered sportfishing heaven , the Great Lakes had become a wasteland . Parasitic sea lampreys had wiped out the lake trout , and massive schools of alewives  --  small , shadlike baitfish that had the unpleasant habit of dying by the millions every summer and fouling the beaches  --  were nearly all that thrived in the lakes . Nobody knew if the salmon would feed on the alewives , or even if they would survive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Platte Bay late that summer all expectations were surpassed . They had grown an astonishing eight to 15 pounds in less than two years , and they were returning to their parent stream in numbers that even the most optimistic fisheries biologists had not dreamed of . The fever spread . Mile-long lines of vehicles waited to use the access ramps , and frenzied anglers launched their boats the way a dump truck unloads a full bed of refuse : backing up fast to the ramp and hitting the brakes . They would park then in the sand along the road , getting their vehicles stuck to the axles and abandoning them there . Later , when salmon moved up the rivers , the fever moved up with them . I came down with a very bad case of it . We were not prepared for the salmon . Our equipment was inadequate and we had no idea what techniques might catch the species . A few anglers were looking to the Pacific Northwest and Alaska for precedent , but most believed that once the salmon entered the rivers they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that because the fish would inevitably die after spawning , we were justified in harvesting them with any method that worked . That attitude was endorsed by the department of natural resources , and snagging was legalized on virtually every Michigan river those first few years . It became the standard tactic of most river fishermen . On the Boardman , in Traverse City , hundreds of salmon were stacked in every pool from the mouth of the river to the Union Street Dam , a distance of about a mile . Snaggers would fill their five-fish limit , carry the salmon home in the trunks of their cars , then return to fill another limit . Catches of 20 fish a day were not unusual at first , before the competition got intense . By then it was as entertaining to watch the action as it was to participate in it . Fishermen unequipped for the strength of the salmon watched their reels explode and rods shatter . Full-grown men leaped into the river to do battle hand-over-hand with salmon that had smashed their equipment . Fishermen standing elbow-to-elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when hooked fish ran parallel to shore . Harsh words were exchanged . Fights broke out . My friends and I learned fast . We used sturdy fiberglass spinning rods and reels with smooth drags . Many of the snaggers preferred 20 and even 30-pound-test line , but we chose to use eight or 10-pound test , willing to lose a few fish in exchange for the greater casting accuracy of the lighter line . Refining our techniques , we became proud little masters of snagging . We devised our own snagging lure  --  the Silver Spider  --  a treble hook with a heavy bell sinker attached underneath by a few twists of copper wire . It was a deadly , streamlined weapon that rode through the water hooks upright , ready to impale anything in its path . One day after school , the pool was full of more salmon than we had ever seen before . Doug , Russ and I hooked six fish in six casts . But our activity attracted the attention of fishermen above and below us and they were closing in . Russ made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doug , laughing , cast sidearm to put his hook beneath the same branch , hauled back once and nailed a big , silver female that did a tail-walking routine the length of the pool . Seven for seven . I made a cast , jerked , reeled up , jerked , and was into another fish . Eight for eight . After hundreds of pounds of snagged salmon I knew immediately not only the size of the fish but approximately where it was hooked : head , side , belly or tail . This was a small one , maybe three pounds , hooked amidships . I wasted no time , simply derricked it in and dragged it onto the beach . But it was not a salmon . It was a brown trout , vivid with spawning colors , with the hooked jaw and thick body of a healthy , mature adult  --  the largest and most beautiful trout I had ever hooked . I had snagged dozens of salmon and never felt the slightest remorse , treating them like throwaways , like objects of commerce given out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a wild , natural fish , here for a purpose that had nothing to do with the circus atmosphere of this mock-run of salmon . It was not the first trout I had seen snagged . A few steelhead had entered the river , and they were sometimes netted and hurried to car trunks by men and boys who laughed about their indiscretion . Possessing snagged trout was unlawful of course , but the law seemed to be held in abeyance in those days . Determined to release the trout , I knelt and removed the hook carefully . The wound seemed shallow , harmless . " What you got there ? " I looked up , expecting a conservation officer . He was perhaps 40 years old , dressed in street clothes , wearing aviator 's sunglasses . Not a conservation officer ; not a fisherman , either . " Brown trout . I hooked him accidentally . " " Accidentally . Sure . " " I 'm going to let him go . " " Why let him go ? I 'll take him . " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not fishermen , but they liked to watch . Sometimes they cadged a salmon or two from fishermen whose freezers were already filled . " I have to let him go . " " Seems like a shame , a waste . " " He was hooked lightly . He 'll be OK . " I noticed his trousers were too long and the cuffs had frayed where they dragged on the ground . He wore black , heavy-heeled leather shoes caked with mud . I looked up and he was smiling at me . He never quit smiling . " It 's just going to die anyway , " he said . " No it 's not , " I insisted . I was growing uneasy . I wanted to release the trout and see it swim away as if nothing had happened . The man smiled , shrugged and stepped forward . He raised his foot and brought it down hard , heel first , on the trout 's head , crushing it into the gravel . The body jumped once , then was still . He slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " See ? " he said . " It 's just gon na die anyway . " It was the act of a schoolyard bully , not an adult . It sickened me with nausea , fury and guilt  --  as if it had been my own muddy boot that crushed the life from the trout  --  and I could do nothing but watch in disbelief and horror as the man swaggered away . I did n't know it yet , but I was finished as a snagger . I would go home that afternoon unsure what had happened , knowing only that the fun had gone out of it . In a few years the DNR would virtually abolish snagging anyway , limiting it to a few short stretches of the larger rivers . Anglers , forced to experiment , would discover that salmon in rivers could be caught after all on lures , baits and flies . Standing beside the river , watching the man walk off with the mutilated trout , I realized that my enjoyment had been tainted all along . I realized too why my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open lake , had shown little interest in snagging them . My friends and I had caught fish , many fish , but it had been an empty exercise . Intent on having fun , we had failed to consider fair play . It was obscenely easy to convert abundance into waste , but at some point  --  and now it seems inevitable  --  there must always be a reckoning . <p>
