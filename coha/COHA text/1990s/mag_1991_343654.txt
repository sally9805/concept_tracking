Advocates of educational reform are not usually known for their fancy gold chains or expensive rattlesnake and elephant hide cowboy boots . That suits Patrick Taylor , 53 , just fine ; he likes to stand out , even in a high-minded crowd . For the past 18 months , the publicity-loving , strikinglygarbed Louisiana oilman has been cutting a swath across the U.S. , lobbying state legislatures to adopt a plan that would guarantee qualified and needy students a tuition-free education . Taylor calls his scheme a kid 's bill of rights and declaims , " We must ensure that high school does not become just a dead end . " <P> In 1989 the Taylor plan became a law in Louisiana , and 1,300 students in the &; state have benefited from his enthusiastic vision . Arkansas , Florida , Indiana , New Mexico and Texas have enacted their own versions , which will pay all or most tuition bills and other fees at state colleges , and a Maryland plan is expected to be signed into law later this month . Taylor knows what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , he left home in Beaumont , Tex. , with nothing but a suitcase full of clothes , 35 cents and the desire to attend college . He chose Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and earned a petroleum engineering degree . Eventually he became one of Louisiana 's richest men as owner of oil- and gas-producing Taylor Energy Co. ( 1990 revenues : $50 million ) . <P> Taylor 's plangrew out of a speech-making performance in 1988 to 183 seventh- and eighth-graders at Livingston Middle School in New Orleans . Most were lagging behind several grades ; many were on the verge of dropping out . On impulse , Taylor asked who would like to go to college . Every hand shot up . If they studied hard , did well and stayed out of trouble , he promised to send them . The " Taylor Kids , " as they are called , accepted the challenge : 126 are still in school . <P> The spur-of-the-moment offer was not unlike one made by New York City industrialist Eugene Lang in 1981 . Lang offered to foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an act that led to the founding of the I Have a Dream Foundation . Taylor took this notion one step further by selling legislatures on his idea and making it a law . <P> High school kids must work hard to qualify for the programs . In Louisiana needy students have to take a college-preparatory core curriculum , maintain a 2.5 grade-point average and score at least 20 out of 36 on the Enhanced American College Test . Some black legislators , however , object to the requirements , which they feel exclude too many disadvantaged minority kids . Other lawmakers wonder where the states will find the millions of dollars needed to pay for the programs . Taylor , who still hands out about $300,000 a year to help needy students , fires back that " only 14% of our youth are graduating from college . If we do n't double that in the next 10 years or so , we could cease to function as a leading industrial power . "                 @ @ @ @
