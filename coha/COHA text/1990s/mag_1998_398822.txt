Making the Landscape Your Own Winner of the $500,000 top prize in the Arts for the Parks competition , Arizona artist William Scott Jennings describes how he creates romantic landscapes . <p> During ceremonies in September 1998 at Jackson Lake Lodge in Grand Teton National Park , it was announced that William Scott Jennings ' painting , Timeless Beauty , was chosen as the top winner in the annual Arts for the Parks competition . The $50,000 prize and publicity about the award recognized an outstanding painting and extraordinary artist . Having served as one of the judges of this competition , I scheduled this article to follow the announcement in Wyoming . <p> When asked to ascribe a stylistic label to his landscape paintings , William Scott Jennings responds with a term he coined long ago : representational romanticism . Indeed , the artist 's lush realistic landscapes are infused with a heightened sense of drama and an air of mystery . " I start with a well-organized drawing and a solid compositional structure based on direct observation , " he explains . " I want my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want them to feel the effects of being at a place when the conditions are most exciting . " <p> This building toward a romantic painting begins in the landscape where Jennings considers ways to capture the drama of nature with his oil paints . " Nothing is as effective in teaching artists what they need to know about painting the landscape as doing outdoor studies . Working outdoors affords an artist the opportunity to carefully study color , light , and composition  --  the three basic elements of a painting  --  and open up new possibilities , " he says . " The studio should be a place to express what has already been learned in nature . " <p> A comparison between his plein air sketchers ( con the next two pages ) and the studio paintings ( reproduced elsewhere in the article ) illustrates Jennings ' point . The small outdoor studies record the artist 's exact observations , while the larger studio pictures combine elements of several sketches into an encompassing , dramatic statement . They record the landscape under a cool , uniform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest indication of atmosphere . The studio pictures , on the other hand , are illuminated by a raking late afternoon amber light that creates bold patterns of light and dark as moisture rises from the valleys into the sky . <p> Jennings paints outdoors several times a week , and he often joins other artists on painting trips or during plein air events . Sometimes one 8 " - x-  10 " or 11 " - x- 14 " sketch holds enough information to be scaled into a larger studio picture , but more frequently Jennings uses several such studies to invent a comprehensive landscape painting . " The sketches are studies of nature and exercises in paint application , " he explains . " Sometimes they capture something worthy of a larger scale , but most of the rime they give me pieces of a complete story . " <p> There is also a limitation to plein air sketching that separates outdoor painting from studio work . " While on location , I try to capture lighting effects that only last for short periods of time , so I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points out . " I work fast , focusing all my attention on recording what I see within a one- or two-hour period . If I 'm painting while the sun is setting , I have even less rime than that . There is n't an opportunity to enhance the romantic feel of the landscape or carefully balance all the compositional elements . That has to be done in the studio . But even though I 'm not attempting to paint a complicated picture on location , I never begin a painting or study without feeling a sense of satisfication with my composition . " <p> Thomas Moran ( 1837-1926 ) , who was among the first to paint the Western landscape , inspired Jennings to create studio pictures from a collection of on-site studies . " Moran made graphite drawings and small watercolor paintings of a landscape from different vantage points and then combined them into massive studio pictures . He was a master at using the light and color studies he made during several days of hiking through the wilderness . " <p> Like Moran and other notable artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When I first began painting I used photographs extensively , but 12 years ago I compared my plein air sketches to photographs of the same scene and realized how much the camera and film distort the eye 's perspective , " he explains . " Since then I have only used photographs during the initial stages when I am drawing the subject on canvas and blocking in the first layer of paint . After these first steps , I rely on my memory and the plein air sketches . " <p> Jennings advises artists interested in working on location to " keep it simple . " In other words , work with a limited palette of colors , use small canvases , and focus your attention on small sections of the landscape . His own palette includes cadmium red deep , alizarin crimson , cadmium orange , cadmium yellow , cadmium yellow deep , yellow ochre light , raw umber , burnt sienna , terre verte , cobalt blue , ultramarine blue , and titanium white . He also recommends working with relatively large brushes because they help the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small details . " Use the edges of large brushes to paint details , " he advises . " Your primary concern should be capturing the light and color vibrancy . " For his work , Jennings uses 1/2 " to 1 " bright or flat brushes . <p> Jennings paints a scene from the background forward , establishing the lights and darks while quickly moving the brush . " I block in the darks to build contrast and develop the light and dark masses " he explains . " As the painting is developing , I step six to eight feet back from the painting to see how the colors and brushstrokes relate to one another . If something works from a distance , I leave it alone and move on to another area that needs to be brought to a comparable level of completion . " <p> For his studio paintings , Jennings ' procedure can be broken into distinctive stages that help him construct the composition of values , overlay the color , and instill the atmosphere of a scene . After drawing the image in graphite on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the picture with a purple-gray color made from a combination of cobalt blue , ultramarine blue , and either cadmium red or burnt sienna . " I apply flat colors giving no attention to anything except light and dark masses , " Jennings comments . " The direction of the brushstrokes suggest the lay of the land within the shadows . " Once satisfied with the composition of dark values , Jennings lightly brushes the purple color over areas of the canvas that have not yet been painted , which establishes gray and white tones in the sunlit portions of the landscape . <p> After the initial dark color , Jennings applies two or three layers of local color , working from the top of the canvas to the bottom , and from the background of the scene to the foreground . " I do this initial painting with brushes that are 1 " or larger , " he explains . " I generally use one brush for an extended period of rime to create a harmony between separate applications of color . I just wipe the brush with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Generally , each area of light and shadow is composed of three values and colors . The middle value is painted first , then the dark , then the light , " Jennings continues . " These values are blended and modeled to achieve the variations that exist within a landscape . To help with the blending , I use the oil paints straight from their tubes , as I want the picture to remain wet until I am 90 percent finished with a painting . That way I can blend the colors , soften edges , and modulate the values . <p> " Soft edges are a critical aspect of my painting , " Jennings adds . " I keep most of the edges soft during the painting process and later sharpen the edges near the center of interest . I have my students practice edge control because it 's one of the more difficult aspects of oil painting . " <p> Jennings teaches five-day workshops in the spring and fall near his home in Sedona , Arizona . He advertises these classes on his Web site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various stages of development and answers questions about his techniques . <p> Since he established the Web site two years ago , Jennings has been able to effectively communicate with students , collectors , and dealers . In addition to instructional information , he offers biographical and professional data , a gallery of recent paintings categorized by subject matter , and an inventory of 50 to 60 sold pictures . " It 's become an important professional tool , " Jennings says . " The galleries that represent me can show clients all my available paintings or help them decide on a commission . As soon as I finish a painting , I scan the image into the computer so it is immediately available for sale . If a client wants a picture I have already sold , they can commission one similar to the image they see on the computer screen . " <p> Jennings also uses e-mail to maintain contact with people . He devotes a portion of each day to sending or responding to E-mail messages . " It 's cheaper and more efficient than phone calls or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send notes to dealers , publishers , or clients at night instead of calling them during the day when the light is better for painting . " <p> Jennings created a Web site for the Laguna Plein Air Painters Association ( LPAPA ) , an organization in which he holds signature membership . While the association began as an informal gathering of friends who painted together once a month near Laguna Beach , California , it is now a major force in contemporary plein air painting with support from the Laguna Art Museum and private and corporate collectors . LPAPA is sponsoring a fund-raiser for the museum on July 17 , 1999 , during which plein air painters from around the country will compete for prizes totaling more than $20,000 . <p> Jennings studied at the Harris School of Art in Tennessee ( now defunct ) and worked as a commercial artist before his first gallery exhibition in 1976 . Since then his paintings have been included in national and international exhibitions and have received major awards . His entries in the Arts for the Parks competition have been included in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1997 , and 1998 , have won numerous awards ( silver medal in 1994 ) , and have been reproduced as posters . Jennings has been the subject of feature articles in Art of the West , Southwest Art , and Focus magazines . He is represented by The May Galleries in Scottsdale , Arizona ; The Knox Galleries in Denver , Vail , and Beaver Creek , all in Colorado ; the Mountain Trails Galleries in Sedona , Arizona , Jackson , Wyoming , and Santa Fe , New Mexico ; and Pitzer 's of Carmel in Carmel , California . He lives with his wife , Elsa , and their sons , Adam and Nathan , in Sedona , Arizona . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Sunset on the Valley , 1998 , oil , 40 x 48 .
