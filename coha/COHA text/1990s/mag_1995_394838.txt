The PortaScope is a great project or backyard astronomers wanting their first telescope or wanting to move up in aperture . It features a 10-inch mirror for viewing faint deep-sky objects , a partially baffled tube for good image contrast , a 2 " focuser for use with wide-angle and ultra-low power eyepieces , a two-piece tube for portability , a door for easy access to the mirror for cleaning , and a novel mirror mount for easy collimation . To keep the scope simple and inexpensive , it uses an altazimuth mount popularized by John Dobson . With the low prices of Dobsonian scopes sold by several manufacturers , why build a scope ? When you purchase a scope from a manufacturer , you buy convenience . After a couple of simple assembly steps , the scope is ready to take outside for your first observing session . But unless you think exactly like the manufacturer , the scope is n't customized to your preferences . By making your own scope , you can fit it with exactly the features you want . Gone are the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounts in metal . Now they can choose from a number of high-quality parts with which to assemble a scope . The PortaScope costs about $625 to build , complete with a Telrad finder and a good-quality eyepiece , comparable to the cost of a manufactured scope without a finder . With the expenditure of some time ( about 50 hours ) , you can build a scope with more features than a commercial scope and one that will perform at least as well , if not better . And do n't forget the pride of telling friends that you built it yourself and the pleasure of watching a stack of lumber turn into an instrument that can capture the light of a galaxy millions of light-years away . PortaScope uses several purchased parts : primary mirror , diagonal mirror , diagonal holder and support , focuser , and finderscope . The scope has three owner-built parts : tube , altazimuth mount , and primary mirror cell . Part one of this series covers constructing the tube and mount , and part two , in next month 's issue , describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finderscope , and collimating the scope for its " first light " observing session . Laying Out a Design The PortaScope uses an f/5.6 mirror to keep the tube short ( an f/4.5 mirror with an 11 " shorter focal length is also available ) . To shield the eyepiece from stray light , the tube is overly long ( about a tube diameter or 12 " past the diagonal mirror ) . Several internal baffles reduce scattered light in the tube . The tube has about an inch of clearance around the mirror to help ventilate the tube and remove heat from the light path . Turbulence in the tube is one cause of bad seeing , or blurring of an image formed by otherwise good optics . To avoid cutting off the light in the corners of wide-field views ( vignetting ) , the scope uses an elliptical diagonal with a 2.6 " minor axis . This is 26 percent of the primary mirror 's diameter , which might be unacceptable to observers wanting extremely high contrast . Substituting a 1-1/4 " focuser would permit a 1.83 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets and in faint nebulae and galaxies . If some vignetting is tolerable , a 2.14 " diagonal would provide slightly higher contrast views with the 2 " focuser . As with all Dobsonians , the base of the telescope also forms its altazimuth mount . The scope rocks up and down on two flanges that sit in cutouts in the sides o a three-walled box . The rocker box , in turn , rotates on top of a board that rests on the ground . Before ordering parts and cutting wood , decide what you want from a scope . For example , if your observing needs are modest or you want a scope lighter in weight , an 8-inch mirror might be adequate and would save $100 . Use of a 1-1/4 " focuser allows a smaller diagonal and saves at least $35 , not to mention the savings on eyepieces . Some backyard astronomers prefer a rack-and-pinion focuser but it can cost twice as much as the helical focuser used in the PortaScope . Other astronomers prefer the magnification of an 8x50 finder over the nonmagnified view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finderscope . Check the ads in ASTRONOMY and get some catalogs from dealers that sell telescope parts . Spend a few nights exploring options before committing to one accessory or another . It 's easier to change the design of the scope before you 've started  --  or finished  --  construction . Once you decide on the primary mirror size , diagonal size , focuser size and type , and a finderscope , order these parts right away . It 's not uncommon to encounter a three- to six-month backorder for at least the primary mirror . Wait until all the parts have arrived before starting construction so you wo n't have any surprises about actual dimensions . If you 're designing and building a scope from scratch , you should assemble the tube first . That enables you to install the mirror , focuser , finderscope , and diagonal and then find the balance point along the length of the tube so you know how high to make the sides of the rocker box . But the dimensions of PortaScope are already known , so we 'll start with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed parts use plywood . ( Particle-board is heavy and OSB or waferboard is hard to finish . ) To prevent delamination of the plies , use an exterior-grade plywood . The choice of grades is up to you : B/C or A/C is easier to finish than a C/D product , but the inside of the tube should be rough to help trap scattered light . For the rocker box base and ground board , cut two 22 " - diameter circles from the 3/4 " plywood using a saber saw . A nail and a pencil taped to a yardstick can substitute or a beam compass to mark the circle . You could make these square , but circles prevent catching a toe on the ground board in the dark . The disks need not be precisely circular but you can match the edges , if you wish , with a Surform file . From scraps of the 3/4 " plywood , cut three feet for the ground board about 5 " across and 3 " wide . These can be any shape but I cut the 5 " sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the feet would be flush with the outer edge of the ground board . Attach each foot to the bottom of the ground board with glue and two 1-1/4 " screws . Traditionally , Dobsonians use nylon and a plastic laminate ( Formica or other brands ) for the azimuth bearing surfaces . The idea is to make the scope turn easily with a gentle shove but not so easily that a light wind will push the scope out of position . Large Dobsonians need more slippery Teflon to make turning easy . But for the weight of this scope , cheaper nylon should work well . If you find that the scope does n't turn easily , you can always substitute Teflon for the nylon . ( Scrap Teflon is available from many plastic dealers ; see " Plastics " in the phone book . ) For the nylon surface , nail three 1 " - diameter chair gliders onto the ground board 120deg apart . The gliders have built-in nails so the nail heads wo n't score the laminate . The plastic laminate covers the bottom of the rocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textured so the nylon gliders will slide easily over its surface . Get a piece about 24 " x 24 " to avoid having to align the sheet carefully on the disk . The excess will be trimmed later . Use contact cement to attach the laminate to the disk . Spreading the cement evenly with a brush , apply some to the disk and some to the bottom side of the plastic . You may need to roughen the surface of the plastic with sandpaper before applying the cement ( see the manufacturer 's instructions ) . After about 30 minutes , the cement takes on a glossy sheen that means it 's ready to stick together . Place some scrap wood pieces on the disk so the laminate ca n't accidentally touch  --  and adhere to  --  the disk . Once the two objects touch , the contact cement wo n't easily release them . Center the laminate roughly over the disk and remove the sticks one at a time , pressing the plastic onto the contact cement . After removing all the sticks , press the plastic firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sharp utility knife . Finish the edge with a fine-toothed file , keeping the file at a 45deg angle to prevent chipping of the laminate later . Drill a 5/16 " hole in the center of both disks . Insert a 5/16 " carriage bolt first through the ground board and then through the rocker base . Place a washer over the bolt and secure lightly with a wing nut so the disks can still rotate freely . The rocker box needs to be slightly bigger than the tube . Figuring that the tube is 13 " square and various hardware sticks out about 1/2 " on all sides , the inside dimension needs to be at least 14 " . So cut two 14-1/2 " x 30 " sides from 3/4 " plywood . Cut a half circle , about 5-1/2 " in diameter , centered along the top of each side piece . ( This supports the altitude bearing , a closet flange of 5 " actual diameter . ) The top corners can be cut back at a 45deg angle to prevent bumping a leg into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " x 20 " piece of 3/4 " plywood , supports the two sides . This piece is shorter than the sides to allow the scope to point near the horizon . The joints of the box require gluing blocks because fasteners screwed in the edge of the plywood wo n't hold . Oak quarter-round molding makes useful glue blocks . Glue and fasten the blocks to the front and bottom edges of the two side pieces with 1-1/4 " long screws . It 's the glue that holds the joint together , so three screws per block should suffice to hold it until the glue dries . Drill pilot holes for the screws ; they 're especially needed because of the hard oak . Attach the front support piece to the front edges of the side pieces using glue blocks . Check that the sides are square using a carpenter 's square . Center this three-sided box on the disk with the laminate facing down . Glue the blocks to the base and drill pilot holes for the screws through the blocks and into the base at a 45deg angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box to the base . Screw a glue block to the bottom of the front support board and attach it to the base for additional strength . On one of the half circles cut from the top , mark two lines at 45deg from the straight edge . The lines should go through the center of the circle and make a 90deg angle with each other . Use this template to locate two 3/4 " gliders in each half circle and nail them in place . Use a file and sandpaper to round the edges of the rocker box and the top edge of the base disk . This will prevent splinters and make the box easier to handle . The base is relatively light ( 27 pounds ) and easy to carry . But mounting a 5-1/2 " garage-door handle on each side of the box about 17 " above the base disk makes lifting the mount from the car trunk or carrying it from the garage to the observing site even easier . Tubular With the mount finished , the remaining major assembly is the tube . A 10-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube with an inside dimension of 12 " . The PortaScope tube uses 1/2 " plywood for rigidity with minimal weight , which means the outside dimension is 13 " . Now to determine the tube 's length . Find the focal length of the mirror ( usually written on the mirror 's back ; 56 inches for the PortaScope ) . The diagonal-to-focus distance is the tube radius ( outside dimension of the tube ) plus the height of the focuser plus one-half the focuser travel . The helical focuser is 1-5/8 " high and has 1-3/4 " of travel . So for the PortaScope , the diagonal-to-focus distance is 6.5 " + 1.625 " + 0.875 " = 9 " . The tube length is the mirror cell thickness ( including the mirror ) plus the focal length minus the diagonal-to-focus distance plus the inside tube diameter ( 3.5 " + 56 " - 9 " + 12 " = 62.5 " ; 64 " in the actual design ) . The tube uses simple L joints at each corner . lust as for the rocker box , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each joint inside . The 12 " inside and 13 " outside dimensions mean each side is 12-1/2 " wide . The tube could be made from four sections of 12-1/2 " x 64 " plywood ( requiring two 4 " x 8 ' sheets ) . Some cars wo n't hold a tube that long , so it helps to break the tube in two . Breaking it into two shorter parts also means the tube is lighter to carry and that it can be cut from a single 4 ' x 8 ' sheet of plywood . Much of the scope 's mass is in the primary mirror , so the bottom fourth of the tube holds about half the weight . One place to divide the tube is about 20 " from the mirror end . That puts the altitude bearings on the upper part of the tube , which means that the tube must be assembled before placing it on the mount . A second possibility is to break it around 30 " so the altitude bearings attach to the mirror box . To assemble the scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the upper portion of the tube attached . The PortaScope uses the shorter and lighter mirror box . For a two section tube , cut four 12-1/2 " x 20 " pieces and four 12-1/2 " x 44 " pieces of 1/2 " plywood . A table saw makes cutting these pieces easy , but a circular saw and 4 ' saw guide will also work . Using glue and 1 " long screws , fasten glue blocks to one edge of three 20 " pieces and all four 44 " pieces . The glue blocks are 17 " long for the 20 " pieces and 40 " long for the other sections . Again , it 's the glue that holds the joint together , so three or four screws should suffice to clamp the joint until the glue dries . Next glue and screw the three 20 " pieces together . Use a carpenter 's square to check that each angle is 90deg . Bar clamps can help hold the pieces square while the glue dries . The fourth piece is the removable cover for this section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fourth glue block on the walk of the box . Remove the cover and fasten the glue block to the box . The top of the box has a collar of 1x4 wood that helps lock the two tube sections together . This collar also holds one of four tube baffles . Cut four 12 " lengths of 1x4 . You can use a simple L or a mitered joint to fasten these . The strips extend about 1-3/4 " into each tube . Glue and screw them inside the top of the mirror box . Cut three of the four baffles at this point ( the fourth baffle is part of the mirror mount ) and then install the first one into the mirror box . Make them out of 1/4 " plywood , two 12 " square and one 13 " square . Using a saber saw , cut a 10-3/8 " - diameter circle out of one of the 12 " squares , a 10-1/2 " circle from the other , and a 11-1/2 " circle from the 13 " square . A circle guide makes this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30deg bevel ; this permits a sharp edge on the baffle to cut stray light rather than diffuse it as a blunt edge would . Glue the 10-3/8 " baffle to the mirror side of the 1x4 collar in the mirror box . The sharp edge of the baffle points away from the mirror . Use 3/4 " wire nails to hold the baffle in place while the glue dries . Nail one side in place , then use a carpenter 's square to check for squareness of the mirror box before nailing the other sides of the baffle . This is the last chance to get this section square , which is needed if the two sections are to fit properly . Glue and screw three of the four 44 " pieces together , using a square to check for 90deg angles between the sides . Glue the 11-1/2 " baffle to the front of the tube , again checking or square . Hold it in place with 3j4 " wire nails . At the other end , attach four 12 " lengths of 1x2 as a collar about 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar will hold the 10-1/2 " baffle on the mirror-side of the collar and must clear the 1x4 collar on the mirror box . Simple L joints are sufficient . Screw the collar pieces to the tube walls and then glue and nail the baffle to the collar , checking that the tube remains square . This is a good time to paint the inside of both sections , including the baffles , flat black . Some telescope makers mix sawdust in the paint to provide a rougher surface that is more effective at absorbing stray light . Once the paint dries , attach the fourth wall to the top section with glue and screws . The mirror box requires special fittings to attach its cover : 1/4x20 bolts with an attached knob and right angle fittings designed to hold a bolt in end grain ( a metal rod with a 1/4x20 thread tapped along a diameter ) . Drill four 5/16 " holes through the mirror box sides and into the glue blocks for these fittings . Drill four 1/4 " holes in corresponding places in the cover . Slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold it in place with the four bolts . Slide the two boxes together , perhaps rotating one section until you obtain the best fit . Four draw catches will hold the sections together , two each on opposite sides . Position the catches about 2 " from the tube edge , with the strike on the bottom tube . Finishing Up Remove the draw catches from the tube sections and round the tube edges with a rasp and sandpaper . Give the tube exterior and the rocker box a final sanding , if you wish , and dust the tube ( and workshop ) with a vacuum . Paint the tube exterior and rocker box with a primer . Do n't prime or paint the collar that joins the two tube sections . Lightly sand the parts after priming to remove any raised grain . I painted the tube dark brown so light would n't bounce off the tube into a dark-adapted eye looking through the eyepiece . The dark color will also shed heat faster than a light color , a factor important for good seeing . The mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright as white , but the light color makes it easy to spot the scope in the dark . Use an exterior grade , gloss paint to maintain the scope 's good looks after lots of handling . Once the paint dries , reinstall the draw catches and relax : The main construction jobs are done . In the next issue , we 'll tell you how to complete the PortaScope by making a mirror mount , installing the optics , and collimating the mirror . <p>
