Open again at last , the Villa Borghese Gallery offers a visual feast so magnificent you almost ca n't absorb it all . // Ben Tornata , Paolina ! " ( Welcome back , Pauline ) declared the Italian magazine l'Espresso . Antonio Canova 's sensual statue of Pauline Bonaparte reclines in neoclassic splendor in Rome 's Villa Borghese Gallery . The beautiful and willful sister of Napoleon and reluctant wife of Prince Camillo Borghese is swathed in a sheet that has somehow drifted below her navel , leaving her small but shapely breasts exposed . A half-smile plays on her lips , and her skin glows softly in the light-an effect enhanced by restoring the wax surface to the marble , which the sculpture had when it was originally shown , in 1808 . When scandalized ladies asked Pauline how she could have posed almost entirely nude , she replied : " Oh , but the studio had a stove in it . " In reality , posing nude for Canova was probably her least scandalous act . The princess was notorious for her many lovers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to and from her bath . In late 1983 , Pauline disappeared from public view when the magnificent early-17thcentury villa that houses one of the world 's best-known art collections was closed for major repairs and much-needed restoration . Parts of the gallery had been shut off for one reason or another long before that , but this total closure lasted fourteen years . Last June , the Borghese finally reopened , and Pauline is once again in full view in the first room next to the villa 's ornate entry foyer : " The mistress of the house ready to greet her guests , " observed the newspaper La Repubblica . Actually it 's more a farewell than a greeting . For reasons of security and improved crowd flow , visitors to the Borghese Gallery-limited to 360 at a time , with a twohour maximum stay begin the tour on the second floor , after leaving the basement ticket office and climb ing a narrow circular staircase . Here , in a dozen rooms decorated in the baroque and neoclassical styles , masterpieces by Raphael , Titian , Rubens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masters are displayed . Not an inch of wall or ceiling is left uncovered . There are frescoes ; there are trompes l'oeil ; there are wonderful marble fireplaces and miles of gilded architectual detail . For those accustomed to the neutral backgrounds and muted color schemes of most modern museums , the combined effect of paintings and decor is dazzling , exciting and just a little overwhelming . Reeling slightly , you then come down to the first floor , where the muscular grandeur of several of Gian Lorenzo Bernini 's most important sculptures is both powerful and calming . You finally meet Pauline waiting serenely in what the guidebook designates as Room I.You want to tell her about the superabundance upstairs , but of course she once presided over those rooms herself . ( And perhaps argued with her brother as he helped himself to about half the collection and carried it off to the Louvre . ) You might also wonder about the apple she holds in her left hand . The answer is in the Judgment of Paris fresco on the ceiling above her head.The work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young shepherd Paris settling the dispute among Juno , Minerva and Venus over which goddess was the most beautiful . Venus got the golden apple . By the time Pauline shocked and delighted the scandal-loving Romans with her antics , the villa had been a Borghese family property for almost two centuries . It was built around 1613 , by Cardinal Scipione Borghese , in what was then wooded countryside on the outskirts of the city , and was intended to be both a hunting lodge and a place to house his collection of paintings , sculptures , ancient statues and marbles. // Splendid profusion : the museum 's baroque entrance hall ( ceiling fresco by Mariano Rossi ) . // The scion of a powerful Roman dynasty-his uncle was Pope Paul V  --  Cardinal Borghese was both good news and bad news as a patron of the arts . He commissioned works from Bernini , Domenichino , Caravaggio , Rubens , Lavinia Fontana and several other leading artists of the period . But he was unscrupulous in using his power and connections to obtain by force what he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collection , and most of them came through inheritances or theft-at least , that 's what it amounted to , " says Alba Costamagna , the gallery 's director . " You can build up a collection very quickly that way " The cardinal had Domenichino jailed until the unfortunate artist handed over a painting of Diana that had been commissioned by another-evidently less powerful-cardinal ; and he threatened Caravaggio with imprisonment when the latter was reluctant to give him a dozen of his works ( six are still in the Borghese collection ) . Once , on learning that the pope had confiscated 107 paintings belonging to a well-known Roman artist , he rushed to the Vatican and persuaded his uncle that the Borghese Gallery was the best home for them . Scipione Borghese died in 1633 , and save for a few notable exceptions-such as Canova 's statue of Pauline-little was added to his treasury of masterpieces . In the 18th century the emphasis was on a lavish restoration of many of the rooms to match the cardinal 's legacy.The Borgheses were rich and determined enough to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villa and its precious contents to the Italian state as a museum . In late 1983 , part of the roof collapsed and the gallery was hastily closed to the public . " We discovered that the foundations had begun to give way , " Alba Costamagna explains . " Rome is full of underground rivers and caves , and the ground is weak . " For more than a decade afterward , the Borghese Gallery languished in disrepair . It was sorely missed . Rome is not exactly overloaded with museums , perhaps because the whole city itself is a museum , and some of its finest art is in its churches . But the coming millennium has brought a government-led renaissance of the city 's museums . Three years ago restoration of the Borghese Gallery began in earnest , and in the past three months , two new museums of Roman antiquities have opened in the Eternal City . The gallery 's structure was first reinforced , and in 1995 an army of restorers began not only returning the interiors to their original glory , but also re-creating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1613 : Roman statues and busts in the niches , creamy marble walls and pilaster strips the shade of ivory . " We discovered doors and windows that had been boarded up and reopened them , " says Costamagna , " and this reduced the available wall space and required some rethinking about how to display the paintings . But in general we tried to go back to the way the collection was laid out in the cardinal 's day . " ( A guidebook , written in 1650 , gives some idea of the arrangement of the art . ) Works from Scipione Borghese 's core collection are indicated on the very useful new labels by a small image of a cardinal 's hat . What are the museum 's highlights ? A brief tour would start on the upper floor in what is now designated as Room IX , which contains Raphael 's Deposition , one of the paintings returned to its original place here . The poignant tableau shows Christ being carried to his tomb , with Mount Golgotha looming darkly in the background . Raphael painted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , says Alba Costamagna , " The cardinal visited the church and admired the painting , and demanded it as a gift . " When the monks refused , it disappeared mysteriously during the night and resurfaced in the Borghese Gallery . Also in Room IX : a portrait of Raphael 's mistress , the beautiful Fornarina , and the artist 's mystery portrait of an unidentified blond woman of striking good looks cradling a unicorn . Displayed side by side in Room X ( again , as in the cardinal 's time ) are two outstanding versions of Venus by two different artists , painted within ten years of each other-but miles apart in conception and style . The subject of Brescianino 's Venus and Two Cupids is a stunning , hippy Italian maiden so lifelike that she seems about to step right out of the picture . Then there 's Venus and Cupid With a Honeycomb by Lucas Cranach the Elder , a leading painter of the German Renaissance . Cranach 's Venus is as thin as today 's fashion models , and , though otherwise nude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost invisible veil that covers nothing.The same room also contains Correggio 's masterpiece Danae , showing the goddess on a bed with Cupid awaiting the arrival of Zeus in the form of a golden cloud ( the result of that encounter was their son Perseus ) . In Room XV , Jacopo Bassano 's version of The Last Supper , which experts consider one of the most important 16th-century Italian paintings , is another good illustration of the results of recent restoration . Bassano 's apostles are an unrefined lot-tanned , muscular and barefoot , as if they had come to the table straight from their fishing boats on the banks of the Galilee . In the 19th century , the emerald green and iridescent pinks and orange of their robes were painted over because these colors were not in vogue at the time . They have now been restored . The focal point in Room XX is Titian 's great work Sacred and Profane Love , painted in 1514 to celebrate an important marriage . The title was added in the 18th century and undermines the complexity of Titian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride , dressed in white , attended by both Cupid and the nude figure of Venus . On another , the two females represent earthly and heavenly love . On the ground floor , the gallery 's six remaining Caravaggios are grouped in room VIII . In the Madonna of the Palafrenieri , the Virgin-showing cleavage  --  is teaching the young Jesus  --  showing penis - how to crush the serpent , symbol of the devil . No wonder the work , painted for St. Peter 's Basilica , was quickly judged unsuitable and removed from the church . The cardinal immediately swept it into his own collection . He was Caravaggio 's patron , and the museum 's collection includes the artist 's Self-Portrait , St. Jerome and David With the Head of Goliath . The sculpture galleries are dominated by Gian Lorenzo Bernini , who is without rival as Italy 's greatest baroque sculptor . If Bernini had left no other work , his sculptures in the Borghese Gallery would have sufficed to establish his artistic genius . His young David confronting Goliath ( Room II ) , commissioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of slinging the fatal stone . The youth 's tense , angry face is modeled on Bernini 's own and bears a striking resemblance to his Self-Portrait ( Room XIV ) , painted the same year . Give or take a few inches , the life-size sculpture of Apollo and Daphne ( Room III ) stands today where it has since Bernini created it 373 years ago . Daphne is frozen in the act of becoming a laurel tree to avoid being caught by Apollo , god of light . In 1780 , the same story became the subject of a ceiling fresco , framed by a brilliantly executed trompe l'oeil of domed niches . But the grandest setting in the whole museum is reserved for the complex group sculpture-said to be partly the work of Bernini 's father Pietro-of Aeneas fleeing from the burning city of Troy with his father Anchises on his shoulders and his son Ascanius by his side . Colored marble columns and panels and gilded architectural details grace the room . In a clever optical illusion , the walls seem to soar to twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a gigantic fresco , the gods are holding a council about the Trojan War . Photograph The lady was a vamp : Pauline Bonaparte ( 1805-1808 ) . by Antonio Canova. // By modern standards Cardinal Borghese may have occasionally shown a shocking lack of scruple as a collector , but he could never be faulted for lacking taste . When he stole , he was-as Costamagna says-always a discerning thief . The result , observed one Italian critic when the Borghese Gallery reopened , is that if reproductions of the gallery 's best works were left out of a published history of art , the book would no longer make sense . Scipione Borghese ( and , it must be said , his successors ) deserves credit for preserving at least some works from disappearance . " Who knows where some of these paintings , these sculptures , would have ended up if they had n't been in the Borghese Gallery , " muses Costamagna . The Borghese 's interiors and its contents create a setting that is at once historic , unique and impossible to duplicate . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the result is a harmony and beauty that make most other museums seem a little ungenerous by comparison-not to say dowdy .
