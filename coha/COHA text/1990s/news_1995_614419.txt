<p> Atlanta , a city born on the rails and raised around its airport and freeways , faces perhaps its greatest transportation challenge in history during summer 1996 . <p> From July 19 to Aug. 4 , half a million people a day will pour into the city by subway , bus , limousine , cab , car and on foot for the Olympic Games . Within a 3-mile radius , 11 venues and the Olympic Village will attract the highest concentration of people in Olympic history - and all within the central business district of a major American city . <p> Buses are the crux of the plans to move spectators and participants in the Olympics . Some visitors will spend more time riding buses than watching athletes . <p> Downtown , the transit buses will mix with charter buses and a slew of other multiperson vehicles hauling spectators , athletes , reporters , very-important-persons and nobodies-in-particular . <p> Inside the so-called 3-mile-wide Olympic Ring downtown , buses and cars will jockey for lanes with hordes of pedestrians welling up from subway stations and spilling from narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law officers and National Guard troops enforcing street- closing and flow plans will help ensure that traffic at least crawls . <p> But outside the Ring ? Olympnik . Not everyone can drive <p> " I 'm certain this is the most comprehensive involvement in transportation planning by an organizing committee , " says A.D. Frazier , chief operating officer of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games , who oversees the effort . <p> It had to be . The Atlanta Games will be the first to concentrate the majority of activities within an already crowded central business district , and it was clear from the outset that not everyone could drive . <p> " The rail system was one of the selling points of the Atlanta bid , " Frazier says . " The ( International Olympic Committee ) liked the idea of many venues in a concentrated area . " <p> But the challenge that presents is monumental . <p> " We all know there 's going to be congestion , " says Rod Wilburn , the lead consultant on ACOG 's transportation plan . " We need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads ACOG 's transportation program , originally thought reducing peak-hour traffic by 10 percent each weekday would do the trick . But he recently revised his estimate to 25 percent of downtown 's 125,000 workers - and he might not stop there . " The more I get into this , the higher that number goes . " <p> In Los Angeles , traffic planners managed to reduce regular traffic only 6 percent for the 1984 Games . <p> Four strategies <p> Beginning this May , Stone 's staff will begin what he calls an aggressive campaign to persuade downtown employers and workers to use a combination of four strategies to cut so-called background traffic : <p> - Take vacation during the 10 working days " and come to the Games . " <p> - Allow employees to come early and leave early or work shortened hours some days . <p> - Try telecommuting by working at home or in a satellite office by computer modem . <p> - If you must come during peak hours , " change transportation modes and travel times . " Use the regular public transit system or car pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After 7:30 it will not be so easy . " <p> There is a fifth strategy , officially unacknowledged , that might be called the Los Angeles approach : scare tactics . Los Angeles Olympics officials now credit a barrage of nightmare scenario stories in the local media with helping to keep motorists off the roads in 1984 . <p> " In this case we 're going to scare the hell out of everybody and they 're going to come anyway , " says Atlanta traffic engineer John Krueger . " If we have to , we 'll close all the streets downtown . " <p> Surface streets to close <p> " How will all those buses fit on Atlanta 's narrow roads ? " transportation consultant Tom Halleran gasped when told of the plan . The Atlanta-based Halleran helped plan for the Olympics in Los Angeles , where broad boulevards are the norm . <p> The answer is , " very carefully . " Every move will have to be scripted , a process that already has taken three years and will last until the Games start . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the downtown Olympic Ring that includes street closings , is due out in late May . While planners know what must be done , they are seeking " review and comment " from public officials before releasing it to avoid conflicts . <p> " I think you 'll find the road-closing impacts are quite small for an event this large , " Frazier says . <p> Barring a catastrophic accident , streets and roads likely will be a bigger problem than freeways . For that reason , access to many areas of downtown will have to be controlled - or blocked . <p> The question of parking is one of the thorniest issues for ACOG , and one of the most serious potential stumbling blocks . <p> ACOG will lease more than 11,000 parking spaces downtown for staging buses and vans as well as parking for " patrons " who spend $ 50,000 on tickets . <p> Beyond the perimeter , ACOG is looking for up to 75,000 spaces along each of the seven freeway routes into the city . Between now and the end of the year they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers and owners of " pastures and fields . " The only large commitment so far is for 2,500 spaces at Lockheed . <p> " Getting these deals done is an important step , " Frazier said . If Olympic organizers fail to line up suburban parking by the end of the year , it could trigger a domino effect , delaying MARTA 's ability to set a schedule and train drivers and cutting short the time needed to plan for traffic flows in major parking areas . <p> " When you get to lots of 5,000 to 6,000 , you need several lanes from at least three directions , " Wilburn says . " We 've talked about limiting traffic in downtown , but in the areas with the largest parking clusters , we 'll have to have that same kind of reduction . " <p> Simply getting the borrowed buses here on time promises to be a gigantic logistical headache . There are a few transport companies that specialize in delivering buses from factories to transit agencies , but they move only a relative handful of buses a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be here before the Olympic Village opens June 6 , 1996 , but the lending agencies are anxious to limit the time the buses are away . <p> That raises another question : Will enough buses be available in time to run 4,000 drivers through a 40-hour-plus training course ? ACOG officials plan to draw from the 8,000 or so school bus drivers in the metro area , so they wo n't be starting from scratch in the training . But even they will need practice with the longer , more complex transit buses and the specific needs of the Olympics . <p> Planners hope they can work out some of those kinks in dry-run experiments in late summer and fall of this year , Frazier says . Revisions and refinements will be made to the plan until the moment the games start , Frazier says , " and probably after . " <p> " There 's a lot of room for error before it causes catastrophe , " says William Forsythe , who directed transportation for the Los Angeles Games .
