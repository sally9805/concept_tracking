Section : MIDYEAR TAX MOVES If you launch any of these five strategies , the savings will roll in for years to come . <p> Do n't look , come April , for those quick fixes that once reduced your taxes . That old-fashioned approach depended on an army of tax breaks that were cut down in their prime by five successive laws , beginning with the 1.986 Tax Reform Act . The beloved consumer interest deduction ? Gradually dismembered until it disappeared altogether this year . Medical and miscellaneous deductions ? Partially interred under floors  --  2% of adjusted gross income for miscellaneous expenses and 7 1/2% for unreimbursed medical costs . Even your seemingly inalienable right to write-offs for mortgage interest has been breached  --  their value drops if your adjusted gross income ( AGI ) tops $100,000 . <p> To reduce your taxes now , you have to come to grips with today 's less generous realities . Fortunately , they feature the kind of tax breaks that keep saving you money year after year . Working couples , for example , may be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings plans . Parents and their grown children can pool their re sources to buy a house , spreading tax breaks throughout the family . We discuss such techniques below , grouped under four personal-finance categories : income , retirement , investing and your business . As for timing , you ca n't do better than now ; the earlier you adopt some of these strategies , the greater your tax savings will be , and some require months to set up . INCOME <p> Maximize your medical and dependent-care write-offs . Each spouse can annually fund a medical-care flexible spending account ( FSA ) up to the limit set by his or her employer , usually $2,000 to $5,000 in pretax salary , to pay for unreimbursed health-care expenses . <p> In addition , you can contribute up to $5,000 to a dependent-care FSA ; the amount can be used to pay for the care of a child under 13 or a dependent or disabled adult while you are working . For taxpayers in the 28% bracket ( taxable income of $34,000 to $82,150 for joint filers ) , paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax savings alone . <p> If both you and your spouse have FSAs , you may also get a tax break by having the lower-paid spouse do the funding . Reason : Social Security ( FICA ) taxes are now 7.65% of wages up to $53,400 and 1.45% on wages above that amount up to $125,000 . If a spouse who makes less than $53,400 put $5,000 in an FSA , it would shave $383 off his or her FICA tax , on top of the $1,400 in income tax savings . But if a spouse who earns more than $130,000 put the $5,000 in an FSA , he or she would not receive any FICA tax break at all , since the contribution would be regarded as coming from income above the wage cap . <p> Take the alternative minimum tax seriously . Congress originally set the AMT trap for high-income earners with heavy write-offs that in some cases reduced their tax bills to zero . To prevent that from happening , such people had to figure their taxes two ways  --  the standard way and the AMT way  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The AMT uses a flat rate of 24% , instead of the regular rates , which range from 15% to 31% . It also forces taxpayers to include in their taxable income a number of otherwise deductible items , such as state and local taxes , unreimbursed medical expenses and perhaps even a portion of the interest on a refinanced mortgage . <p> Lately , some taxpayers earning less than $50,000 are getting unceremoniously slammed by the AMT The chief trigger : incentive stock options ( ISOs ) , which during the 1980s were sometimes generously awarded to middle managers and even to other employees as well as top executives . <p> In a survey of 122 large companies by the benefits consulting firm of Towers Perrin , for example , the median pay in 1982 of the lowest-paid workers receiving ISOs was $44,000 . At some firms , particularly start-ups , ISOs were granted even to the rank and file to compensate and motivate them while salaries were low . And because ISOs generally expire within 10 years of issuance , the employees who received them during the booming ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The hot breath of the AMT has gotten hotter , " observes George E.L . Barbee , executive director of client services for Price Waterhouse . <p> Here 's the rub : When you exercise ISOs , you owe no tax on the difference between the exercise price and the stock 's current market value , an amount known as the bargain element . ( You owe capital-gains tax on the spread between the exercise price and the trading price when you eventually sell the stock . ) But the bargain element is included in your income when computing your AMT  --  in the year you exercise the options . Thus either on its own or in combination with your other AMT items , the ISO bargain element can tip you into an AMT liability . <p> Do n't tangle with the AMT on your own . Instead , consult a tax pro , ideally before you exercise ISOs . You may be able to avoid the AMT by exercising some options this year and the rest in future years . Or you could avoid the whole problem by selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you exercise , a tactic known as a disqualifying disposition . That way you 'll owe income tax on the bargain element , but you wo n't provoke the AMT RETIREMENT <p> Take full advantage of tax-deferred savings plans . For starters , two-earner couples who both have employer-sponsored retirement plans  --  in general , 401(k)s at corporations and 403(b)s at tax-exempt organizations  --  should carefully divvy up the job of saving . " Working couples tend to save one paycheck and spend the other , " says William Speciale , vice president of Financial Planning &; Management in Lexington , Mass . " But they may be able to get greater tax benefits if each saves something . " <p> Say a husband and wife , both with 401(k)s , earn $40,000 and $50,000 , respectively . Under a typical savings plan formula , if they each contributed 6% of their pretax salaries to the plans , their employers would match them 50% . Contributions above the 6% cutoff  --  to a legal maximum of $8,475 this year  --  would be tax deductible but unmatched . <p> If both spouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set aside  --  and shield from tax  --  a total of $5,400 , for an annual tax saving of $1,512 , assuming they are in the 28% bracket . In addition , their employers would contribute $2,700 to the accounts . <p> If instead the wife alone saved the $5,400 , the couple 's annual tax savings would be the same , but the employer match would fall to just $1,500  --  a needless forfeiture of $1,200 and a loss of tax-deferred buildup over future years . What if you and your spouse ca n't afford to stoke both of your retirement plans to the matching limit ? Scale back on the plan that has the less generous match . <p> Employees of tax-exempt organizations with tax-deferred 403(b) plans might investigate a few commonly overlooked options that may let them salt away more than the maximum permissible contribution of $9,500 a year . For example , a unique catch-up provision allows employees with 15 years of service who made low contributions in the past to boost their current annual investments to as much as $12,500 for five years . INVESTING <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house through shared equity . With this technique , two parties  --  often parents and their asset  --  poor offspring  --  pool resources to buy a house . The kids live there and reap the tax benefits of home ownership , chiefly deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes ; the parents get the tax breaks of owning rental real estate , mainly write-offs for depreciation . And both parties receive a proportional share of the gain at the time the house is sold . <p> Such an arrangement can be tricky . There have been no specific IRS guidelines or court cases to clarify the vaguely worded section of the tax code that authorizes shared equity . As a result , you 'll need an experienced real estate attorney to advise you and to draw up the required documents . Fees typically range from $500 to $1,500 . <p> Consider Myra Vickery Eilerts , a kitchen designer , and her son and daughter-in-law , Steven , 33 , and Guadalupe , 30 , of Santa Barbara . In 1989 , the trio entered into a shared-equity agreement to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their two small children . Myra contributed $38,406 of the $56,480 down payment and closing costs . Steve , an optician , and Lupie , a secretary , put up the remaining $18,074 . All three names appear on the title , with the ownership split between mother ( 58% ) and son and daughter-in-law ( 42% ) . ( A slightly larger ownership share than their down payment warrants went to the couple because they handle the upkeep that would otherwise fall to Myra as a rental-property owner . ) The trio then took out an adjustable-rate mortgage of $204,800 with a first-year rate of 8.95% ; the monthly payment was $1,640 . Next , Myra determined a fair market rental of $950 a month , using newspaper ads as a guide . <p> Here 's how the first year of equity sharing worked out for both parties : Since Steve and Lupie rent just his mother 's share of the house , their monthly rent was $551 ( $950 times 58% ) . So each month Steve wrote two checks , one to his mother for that amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1,640 minus $551 ) . He sent both checks to Myra , who deposited the rent check in her account and forwarded the second check to the lender along with her own check for $551 for the balance of the mortgage . In the event of an audit , the paper trail will prove that reasonable rent was paid  --  an essential element of a properly structured shared-equity agreement , because the IRS wants to prevent parents from charging their children low rents and then writing off the inflated tax losses that would result . <p> Steve and Lupie deducted the interest on their $1,089 mortgage payment , as well as $2,688 in property taxes . Myra reported the rent as income , but since her share of the mortgage interest payment was equal to the rent , she wrote off all the income . She also took an annual $4,049 depreciation deduction on her share of the house . She was allowed to deduct : the amount against her other income since she meets all the requirements for claiming annual rental losses : she owns more than 10% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repairs , and has an AGI under $100,000 . " The tax saving from the depreciation comes to only $1,134 a year , but that 's a nice break while we wait for the house to appreciate , " Myra says . <p> When the house is sold , Steve and Lupie can roll over their share of the gain into a new home as long as they buy it within two years for at least as much as they get for their share of the current house . Myra will owe tax on her share of the gain , unless she opts for a like-kind exchange , a complicated tactic that allows investment-property owners to defer their gain by swapping one property for another of equal or greater value . YOUR BUSINESS <p> Consider incorporating . Tom Miner , 39 , and Bob Kennedy , 43 , mortgage brokers in Phoenix , incorporated last November , after both had worked independently for a year to launch their brokerage business . The corporation pays Miner and Kennedy a salary of $100,000 apiece , which is deducted from the company 's income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had simply split the business profits , each receiving $125,000 . " Tom and Bob were taking out more salary than they needed to live on , " says Michael P. Black , the Phoenix financial planner who advised the pair . " Their personal income tax on the excess income was higher than what the corporation would have paid if the money were reinvested in the company , and some of the excess cash was inevitably frittered away . " Indeed , money that the company retains to finance its growth is taxed at a relatively gentle 15% on the first $50,000 of earnings , compared with a 31% top personal rate . <p> Next , Miner and Kennedy arranged for the corporation to pay-and deduct  --  some of their biggest expenses , such as medical and disability insurance premiums totaling $9,000 and health insurance deductibles and co-payments , which could amount to as much as $2,400 . As independents , each could deduct disability premiums in full but could write off only 25% of health insurance premiums . <p> For retirement savings , the corporation makes a tax-deductible contribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to separate profit-sharing accounts . As sole proprietors , their contributions to profit-sharing Keogh retirement plans would have been limited to 12.12% of net business income . <p> The bottom line : combined first year 's tax savings of more than $ , 4,000  --  not a bad return on the $2,000 the partners shelled out to the advisers who helped them transform their tax lives . DO IT NOW TAX TIPS TO ACT ON RIGHT AWAY <p> Besides launching the long-term tax-cutting strategies described in the accompanying story , you might give your 1991 taxes this quick checkup . Do n't put it off until year-end  --  you could miss out on money-saving moves that you have to make earlier . <p> Fund IRAs and Keoghs . You have until April 15 to make a contribution for 1991 , but if you do it now , you 'll get an extra eight months of tax-deferred compounding . On $2,000 earning 8% , that works out to an additional $54 . You must open a Keogh by Dec. 31 to be eligible for a 1991 contribution . <p> Mark on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts ( described in the main story ) . It 's usually around November . <p> Check your estimated tax payments . You must make them in any quarter on money not subject to withholding , such as interest and dividends . If you underpaid on estimates earlier in the year and are going to owe at least $500 on the income at year-end , you can stop the accrual of penalties and interest by settling up now , using Form 1040-ES . Or you can avoid an estimated tax shortfall altogether by boosting your withholding to cover all your expected income taxes . <p> Consider deferring income . If you want to reduce this year 's taxes by postponing some income until 1992 , you must get your employer to agree in writing before you earn the money . <p> Plan to give appreciated tangible personal property to charity . Usually such gifts heighten your risk of running afoul of the alternative minimum tax . This year only , however , donations of such property are AMT-free . In most instances , you 'll get a deduction for the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's used for the charity 's tax-exempt purpose . <p> Avoid gains on investments you bought this year , if you 're in the 31% bracket . By holding on for at least a year , your profits will be taxed at just 28% . But if you think the investment has peaked , sell now and ignore the tax consequences . <p> Update your records . If you have n't yet set up separate logs for business travel , entertainment , auto and other deductible expenses , do so now . Also reconstruct any missing records , using receipts , canceled checks or other written proof of expenditures . The longer you put this chore off , the more difficult it will be . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : To reduce your taxes now , you have to come to grips with today 's less generous realities . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Myra Vickery Eilerts ( left ) shares the equity and the tax breaks in her daughter-in-law and son 's house in Santa Barbara . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Bob Kennedy and Tom Miner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Phoenix mortgage business . <p> BY TERESA TRITCH <p> FOUR EASY TECHNIQUES WILL ENABLE THE BUCKS TO CUT THEIR TAXES BY 26 PERCENT <p> Before she married Kenneth in 1983 , Dayna Buck of Denver breezed through her taxes each year in 10 minutes , using the one-page Form 1040EZ . Today she needs 30 hours to master the latest changes in the tax law and to prepare a six-page return for her family , pictured at left with the children 's full-time nanny , Christine Comella , 24 . ( Dayna , 31 , is holding Kaitlin , five months , while Kenneth , 32 , is roughhousing with Cody , 3 . ) It 's time well spent . Thanks to their use of four common techniques , the Bucks expect to cut their 1991 tax bill on their $121,327 income by 26% , from $22,464 to $16,735 . <p> Every year , Kenneth , a U.S. Attorney , tucks away 5% of his pretax $58,320 salary , or $2,916 , in the federal government 's tax-deferred Thrift Savings Program . Since Uncle Sam matches Kenneth 's contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his account . For now , on the other hand , Dayna , a $47,000-a-year project manager for a computer firm , puts no money in her 401(k) because her employer does not match contributions . <p> Their main investment , a four-unit apartment building in Cheyenne , Wyo. that the Bucks bought back in 1983 for $125,000 , is also tax advantaged . It generates an annual rental income of $15,272 , which easily covers the $11,650 they pay for such expenses as mortgage interest , property taxes and maintenance . They also garner a $7,800 depreciation deduction , which completely offsets the net rental income plus $4,178 of other earnings . <p> In addition , the Bucks write off $7,600 of interest for two mortgages on their $180,000 four-bedroom house , plus $2,300 in property taxes and $4,450 in other itemized deductions . <p> Finally , the couple glean a tax break from their largest annual expense  --  $12,572 in wages and payroll taxes for their nanny . Because the arrangement is on the books , the Bucks can claim a $960 dependent-care tax credit . <p> PHOTO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
