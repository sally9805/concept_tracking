ContentsConquistador ( Icthyus-Conquistadorus ) $1200 # Dale Bailey lives in Tennessee with his wife , Jean , and a portly cat named Gatsby . He is pursuing his Ph.D . in English and teaching at the University of Tennessee . <p> His short story , " Touched " ( Oct/Nov 1993 ) , will be reprinted in The Best from Fantasy and Science Fiction , which St. Martin 's Press will publish to commemorate our 45th anniversary . He made his first appearance in print in these pages last year , and we have several more of his stories in inventory . <p> WHEN THE PHONE RANG that Friday morning , Howard was staring blankly at the picture of his wife , Bethesda , that stood on his desk . Occasionally , during the long empty days , he stared at that picture and daydreamed of Bethesda as she used to be . In those dreams , he found himself stripping away the pads of fatty tissue which had accumulated about her features . He would pry them up and peel them away , one by one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisoned beneath the countless layers of flesh , like the tiny jeweled figure at the core of a set of nesting dolls . It was an endless task , even in the dreams . <p> And so it was that on this day , as on most days , he dreamed instead of fish . Fish of all colors and types  --  infinitely varied and beautiful schools of butterfly fish and leopard fish and common gold fish  --  drifted through his mind . Long ago , Howard had hoped to be an ichthyologist , but that dream had slowly died , crushed beneath the weight of time and circumstance . These days , he worked in data entry at a water treatment plant , a job he had taken years ago to make ends meet . Now , the report he should have been typing lay forgotten on his blotter while he dreamed of the tropical fish in his basement hideaway . If he could n't actually go look at them when he was at work , he often consoled himself , he could at least think about them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolation was lost . Fragile as spun glass , his fantasy shattered and his mind returned abruptly to the busy office where he worked . Outside his cubicle , Howard could hear a cacophony of ringing phones , typing , and conversation . His own phone rang again . Without interest , Howard picked up the receiver . " This is Howard . How can I help you ? " <p> " Howard ? " said the voice at the other end of the phone . A male voice , breathless with excitement . <p> " Yes , this is Howard , " Howard said . " Can I help you ? " <p> " You 've got to come down here at once . At once . " <p> " Frank ? " Howard asked . Frank , Howard 's only friend , was the proprietor of the Finny Tribe Fish Store . But Frank had never called him at work . " Is that you , Frank ? " <p> " Yes , it 's me . Now get down here ! " <p> " But why ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But . Frank , I 'm at work . I ca n't just walk out . " <p> " Well , come at lunch . But come soon ! " <p> " What is it ? What have you got ? " Frank 's excitement was catching . Howard could hear it in his own voice  --  a shrill undercurrent of hysteria . <p> " You 'll see , " said Frank . " You 'll see when you get here . " He hung up . <p> Howard placed the receiver in its cradle and glared at the report on his desk , his pleasant reverie of fish irretrievably lost . He looked at the clock . It was ten thirty-eight . Reluctantly , he began to type . Lunch seemed a very long time away . <p> When Howard reached the Finny Tribe , Frank pumped his arm enthusiastically . " Howard , " he said . " Have I got a treat for you . " " What ? What is it ? " <p> " You 'll see , " Frank said . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past displays of nets and oxygenators , past a window where dust motes turned in a shaft of sunshine , past stacks of empty aquariums that gleamed with polished vacuity in the fluorescent light . As they entered the back room , Howard inhaled deeply , savoring the ripe , moist , aquarium smell . In that place , with the hundreds of fish secure in their aquariums , Howard felt young and vigorous and alive , as if the endless weight of unchanging days had fallen suddenly away . <p> " Look at it ! " Frank said , staring in awe at the large aquarium before them . <p> Howard stared into the aquarium in amazement . <p> Within swam a conquistador , a fish Howard had always dreamed of seeing , of owning . Muscles rippled smoothly as it powered itself through the water and its scaly hide shimmered in the muted radiance of the aquarium . It arrowed away , looped under a gnarled coral archway , and came to rest in the water before him , hovering . Elaborate fins , tapering away into filmy nothingness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked on in dumb wonder it shrugged the rainbow-hued crest that swept back from its slim face like the wings of an angel . <p> As the conquistador darted away to cruise the perimeter of the tank , Howard was swept up in its smooth trajectory . Nothing of the sort had ever happened to him before . It seemed , momentarily , as if he had become the fish . Brine pulsed through his gills and water caressed his sleek armored length as he ascended toward the distant surface , climbing , climbing , and diving again to cruise the graveled bottom . When the fish drifted into concealment behind the coral ridge , Howard returned to himself with a shock . Bubbles danced surface ward through the still water . <p> The icy touch of departing magic rippled through Howard , along his cheeks , his arms , down unsteady legs . Bemused , he stared at the tiny models perched atop the ridge : a diver in an old-fashioned diving suit , an overturned pirate 's chest spilling gaudy wealth into the water . <p> " A conquistador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've got to have it . Can you hold it for me ? " <p> " I do n't know . It 's pretty rare , and  --  " <p> " Just for a day or two . Till Monday evening . That 's all . " <p> " Howard , I  --  " <p> " Frank , I 've never asked you to do anything like this before . Never . One weekend , that 's all I ask . " <p> " Till Monday , then , " Frank said . " Hell , Howard , can you even afford it ? " <p> Howard looked down at the tiny label affixed to the lower right hand comer of the conquistador 's tank : <p> Conquistador ( Icthyus-Conquistadorus ) $1200 " I do n't know , " he said . And he thought of Bethesda , sitting at home as she always did . He supposed he did know , but he could never say as much . " I 'm going to try . " <p> ALL THAT long weekend the conquistador haunted Howard 's dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his basement hideaway . He cleaned his largest aquarium , installed a fresh filter and air pump , and mixed new water , carefully adjusting the heater to 75 degrees F. Eyes blind to the elaborate waltzes of the tropical fish in their glass prisons , deaf even to the maudlin television sentiment that filtered through the ceiling , he spent the day transported by a recurring vision of the conquistador . <p> Sunday he passed in a daze , ticking off Bethesda 's list of chores with the plodding inattention of a somnambulist . Finally , on Sunday evening , his mind awash in a flood of tropical brine , a whole school of conquistadors performing synchronized swimming routines before his unbelieving eyes , he made his way upstairs to face Bethesda . She sat in the BarcaLounger , her feet propped up , watching a rerun of Gone with the Wind on the wide-screen television . in one fist she clasped a can of Diet Coke . With the unrelenting rhythm of an automaton , her other hand made regular trips between her mouth and a bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Howard , staring mutely at the television from the far corner of the couch . " Hello there , stranger , " she said . " What 's up ? " <p> Howard cleared his throat and launched unthinking into it . He had n't mentioned the fish to Bethesda before , but all weekend he had attempted to be more attentive to her needs than he had in recent years . If he 'd failed it had been only because of the icthyic visions which had washed over him with almost tidal regularity since Friday afternoon . Now , when he 'd finished , the last words tumbling from him in a plaintive rush , Bethesda said , " Howard , how much is it ? " <p> " Twelve hundred dollars , " Howard said . <p> " Twelve hundred dollars ! Howard , are you out of your mind ? " She stabbed the remote with her blunt finger and the television turned off abruptly . She turned to look at him . <p> Howard stared back at her , searching her wide heavy face for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , when Bethesda had been just Beth , it had not mattered that they shared few interests . It had not even mattered that Bethesda possessed few skills to contribute to their union , that Howard alone would have to be responsible for their living . For Howard , it had been enough that this cheerful , statuesque , even voluptuous woman had taken an interest in him . These days , however , Howard rarely thought of Bethesda in such flattering terms . These days , he usually just thought of her as fat . <p> " Howard ! " Bethesda said . " Did you hear me ? " <p> " Yes , " Howard said . " I heard you . And no , I am not out of my mind . " <p> " Then what makes you think we can afford a twelve hundred dollar fish ? " <p> " We can afford it , barely . We afforded that ! " He jabbed his finger at the gigantic television . <p> " We 're still paying for that ! Do n't you think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs with me anymore . " <p> " Well , you never do anything . You just sit in this house and watch television . " <p> " Well , you just sit down there and stare at your aquariums , Howard . Anyway , you must have at least twelve hundred invested in the fish you already own . Not to mention the equipment . " <p> Howard stood up and paced to the window . Pulling aside the curtain , he stared out into the night , but all he could see was the reflection of the den - as if the house went on forever , an endless prison of joyless rooms . As if there was no other place on earth . " It 's extremely rare , " he said . " I 'll probably never get a chance for another one . If they repossess the television , we can always get another one , Bethesda . Always . " <p> Howard turned and looked into her small eyes , recessed in the countless folds of flesh that had accreted about them over the years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . <p> " Oh , Howard , " Bethesda said , " it 's not that . I just do n't understand why you ca n't ever pay any attention to me . " <p> The next morning at work , Howard hunched over his desk with focused intensity . Documents washed across his working space with the metro-nomic regularity of waves , but he typed them without his usual frustration , taking refuge in the numbingly mindless activity of his fingers . He was a rock . All thoughts of the conquistador had been banished from his mind and if occasionally , during that long morning , he did think of the fish , he glanced at the photograph on his desk and recalled Bethesda 's eyes as they filled with tears . At first that was enough to do it . It was okay , he would tell himself . He was resolved . He was a rock . <p> By noon , however , the endless flow of his imagination had begun to erode that rock . When he returned from lunch he found himself occasionally immersed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease . At three o'clock , he discovered to his horror that he had sketched its frilly-necked silhouette across the final draft of a report for a corporate client . By four , the rock of his resolve had been reduced to a smooth wave-tossed pebble . <p> The Finny Tribe was closed when Howard arrived that evening . The security light were already dimly aglow in the quiet interior and the Closed sign was suspended in the window . It mocked him cheerily  --  Please call again !  --  as he plodded across the lot to rap halfheartedly at the door . He was just turning away when the interior was flooded with light and the neon sign in the window sputtered to life . <p> " Howard , " Frank said as he opened the door . " So you 've come back . I thought you would . " <p> Without another word , Frank turned and led him into the watery half-light of the back room . For a long moment they stood in reverent silence before the conquistador . The fish passed through the water with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It hovered momentarily above the plastic diver poised atop the coral mountain . Then its caudal fin flexed and it darted into concealment , its wake upsetting the placid diver . The diver drifted slowly through the water and came to rest on the graveled bottom of the tank . Atop the ridge , the pirate 's chest disgorged its Midas banquet . <p> That delicate magic traced icy patterns across Howard 's cheeks , fleeing . <p> " Good God , it 's beautiful . " <p> " So it is , " Frank said . " And rare . I know at least two other collectors who would die for it . " <p> In the tank , the conquistador slipped from its hiding place . Cruising scant centimeters above the brightly graveled surface , it approached the body of the fallen diver , hovered for a moment , and shot away . It threaded its way through the drifting fronds of an underwater forest , its scales coruscating in the watery light . <p> " I 've got to have it , " Howard said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd love to , but I just ca n't . " <p> " You do n't have to hold it . " The words filled the quiet room . A long moment stretched out and in that silence it seemed to Howard that he could hear the muted surge and fall of blood booming through his body . He thought of Bethesda , her narrow eyes filling with tears , and he tried to pull those words back , felt his tongue and lips shape themselves about the syllables of a retraction  --  <p> But then the conquistador exploded out of the shadow-decked forest and ascended through the water in a long arc , its crest flattened by speed , light scintillant along its polished scales . It drove itself to the surface of the tank and dived again , vertically , pulling up at the last breathtaking minute to come to rest , suspended like a living jewel in the water before him . <p> Howard gasped . It was beautiful . She was beautiful . She . And in the pronoun he detected the quiet ring of possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll call you Miranda . " <p> A few minutes later , Howard slid his Visa  --  charged to the limit  --  back into his wallet . Carefully , he lifted the plastic bag where Miranda was suspended like an angel in a tear drop and lowered it into a paper sack . The last thing he noticed as he left the Finny Tribe that Monday evening was a small sign taped discreetly to the cash register . It said : <p> Sorry . No Returns on Fish . <p> When he got home , headlights ripping cone-shaped swaths through the web of shadows draped across the front yard , Bethesda was waiting at the door . Cold light leaked about her bulky figure and into the gathering night as Howard walked to the house , the paper bag containing the conquistador clasped carefully in his hand . <p> As he mounted the concrete steps , Bethesda stepped back into the harsh radiance of the den . The door swung shut behind him with a sound like the clap of a prison gate . Inside , A Current Affair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bethesda said . " I was worried . " <p> Howard was still for a long moment . That vein at his temple began to pulse once more . " I 'm sorry , " he said , stepping past her toward the hall and the door to the basement . <p> Bethesda looked at the bag Howard carried . " You bought the fish , did n't you ? " she said . <p> Howard looked at his feet , his face flushing with heat . He pulled the door open with his free hand . " No , " he said . " I bought another fish . It was only fifty dollars . " <p> " Howard . You better not have bought that fish . " <p> " Do n't worry , " he said as he stepped down to the top stair . He pulled the door closed behind him and stood there for a long moment , alone . <p> His heart hammered . During the long years , they had slowly drifted away from each other , but they had rarely fought . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shared their home . Until now , Howard had never felt compelled to lie to Bethesda . He had the sense of some irrevocable marker reached and passed . Some turning point . <p> And then the bag vibrated in his hand , reminding him of the fish . Of Miranda . Howard took a deep breath and descended into the darkness . <p> Down there , he gripped the plastic bag tightly and let the paper sack drop to the concrete floor . Miranda nosed at the bulging perimeter of her prison . Aqueous light sparkled along her rainbow-stained flanks . His eyes shining , Howard lowered Miranda , bag and all , into the newly prepared aquarium to begin the process of acclimating her to her new home . <p> Then Howard eased off his shoes and lowered himself onto the sagging couch in the precise center of the room , consciously ignoring the television which blared from above . A warm glow of contentment suffused him . His eyes roamed about the aquariums , drinking in the quiet vision of the myriad fish , secure in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water in the bag and that in the surrounding aquarium , he released Miranda into her new home . As soon as she was free , Miranda flexed her tail and darted away to probe tentatively about the perimeter of the aquarium . Smiling , Howard settled back onto the couch to watch . She was frightened now , but she would soon grow used to her new home . It was just a matter of time . <p> Meanwhile , he sat there and watched her , asea in the flickering luminescence of the aquariums . Icy fingers caressed him , numbing , and slowly , almost imperceptibly , his arms were transformed into great translucent fins , fanning out into the water around him . His legs knotted together , twining into a powerful tail . Scales sprang up from beneath his skin , and gills billowed open along his cheeks . Through the azure water he dove , deeper and deeper , as cleansing brine pulsed through his gills . Deeper he dove , and still deeper , and finally there were no other fish . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , splintered into a thousand sparkling diamonds by the current , and he coasted silently through sun and drifting shadow , unthinking . <p> There was only the steady blare of the television filtering through the ceiling to remind him . <p> HE WOKE to silence , pinned in a shaft of light that fell into the dim basement from the open door . All around him , tropical fish turned and turned . <p> Miranda was suspended in the large aquarium directly before him , gills swelling . <p> Bethesda said , " You bought it , did n't you ? " <p> Howard gasped . Fragment by slow fragment , his sleepy eyes pieced his wife 's form out of the darkness . <p> " That 's it , is n't it ? " She moved through the darkness to stop by Miranda 's aquarium . Her hand floated into the shaft of light from upstairs , gesturing . <p> Startled , Miranda darted away to conceal herself behind the knot of coral . At the same instant , Howard came to his feet . His heart pounded ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Howard ? " <p> He pulled to a stop , gasping . " I  --  I 'm sorry . I thought you were going to hurt Miranda . " <p> Bethesda stepped toward him again , and the light fell half-across her face , bisecting it . " Miranda ? " <p> Howard lowered himself back to the couch . " Miranda . The fish . " <p> " Oh . " Her voice was ominously quiet , quieter than he had ever heard it in all the years they had been married . " You bought the fish today , did n't you , Howard ? The one you wanted . " <p> Howard said nothing . <p> " You knew we could n't afford it . " <p> " Bethesda , " he said . " Bethesda , I did n't have a choice . I 'll never get another chance . " <p> " I see . Well , you can take it back . " <p> " I wo n't take it back . I ca n't . " <p> Bethesda was silent for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just buying the damn fish , Howard , " she said at last , her voice heavy with the promise of tears . Tears , and something else  --  some resolve Howard had never before heard . " You know what 's worst of all ? You lied to me . " She sobbed once , briefly , and fell silent again . <p> For a long time there was no sound in the room but the quiet gurgle of air filters , of bubbles rising slowly surface ward in the aquariums . Finally , thinking she had gone , Howard opened his eyes . But she was still there , by Miranda 's tank , one side of her face submerged in shadow , staring at him , the one eye he could see cold with anger . That sense of having reached a turning point , an irrevocable crux , came back to him . <p> Bethesda 's face grew colder still , as if she too had found something within her she had not been aware of before . She said , " It 's late , Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her upstairs . That night , he was swept away by a tide of dreams . Transformed beside his sleeping wife , he cruised the dark waters of sleep . Perhaps he heard Bethesda get up in the night , but later , remembering , he was never certain . If he did , he must have thought she was going to the toilet , must have rolled over , pulled his pillow close , and drowned himself in dreams again . <p> The next morning , he woke at six . As always , he made his way into the adjoining bathroom and relieved himself , his eyes closed , half-asleep . <p> When he opened his eyes to shake himself clean , he found Miranda floating in the garish yellow water of the toilet , belly up . The brilliant colors had fled from her underscales . The light from the fluorescent bar above the sink glinted dully in one black eye . <p> * * * Later that day , looking back , he was proudest of the fact that he had remained calm . He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and rinsed away the golden droplets which clung to her frilly collar . Then he went on about his morning  --  showered , shaved , scrubbed his teeth , even set the alarm clock for nine-fifty , as he did every morning so Bethesda would n't miss Wheel of Fortune . <p> As a sole concession to the anger that boiled within him , he removed from its place above the living room mantel Bethesda 's prized photograph of Elvis Presley  --  signed by the King himself following a concert in Vegas . Not that Bethesda would notice , not immediately anyway . She passed her days in the den watching television , pausing only for trips into the kitchen for popcorn , Ding-Dongs , and Eskimo Pies . The living room was reserved for entertaining , closed off , inviolate , furniture still enveloped in plastic . Nonetheless , watching the thin line of blue flame curl up from one comer and devour Elvis Presley 's bloated face gave Howard at least a temporary measure of satisfaction . <p> He buried Miranda in the back yard , struggling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . Then he went on to work . <p> At lunch , he drove down to Macon 's Sports Emporium and bought a Louisville Slugger , paying cash . He tried not to question what he was planning to do . He tried to be as cold and emotionless as a robot , tried to pretend that someone had removed all those warm , fallible , human viscera and replaced them with shining cogs and gears and coils of copper tubing . Tried to pretend that his heart was an iron pump , unfeeling , that machine oil coursed through his veins . <p> Later , at home , while Bethesda took her evening bath , he walked to the car and removed the bat from the trunk . <p> Bethesda glared at him in shock when he kicked the door open . Her mouth gaped . Her eyes widened . <p> " Howard ! What are you doing ? " She raised her hand to cover her breasts , and water lapped over the edge of the tub . " Why do you have that bat ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and returned his gaze to his wife . Bethesda shifted her weight in the tub . Water sloshed over the tiles . Her heavy features twisted into a helpless , frightened mask . <p> " Howard ? " she said , almost whimpering . And her eyes filled up with tears . <p> When Howard saw those eyes , saw tears spill across her wide cheeks , he knew he could not do it . It did not matter that things were irrevocably changed , that they had passed some turning point . He let the bat clatter to the floor . <p> " Get out of the water , " he said . <p> " What ? " <p> An image of Miranda came to him , her flanks shimmering with aqueous light as she darted gracefully through the water . Bethesda  --  bloated monstrosity of a woman  --  had no business in the water . When she wallowed about , it sloshed and splashed , spilled over the edge of the tub and gathered in the recessed borders between the tiles . She looked like a great pasty-white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted in the tub . She was an affront . <p> " I said , get out , " he repeated , and when she did n't move he strode deliberately across the small room , kicking the abandoned bat aside . Clutching her water-slick arms , he heaved her out of the tub . Water sloshed across the tiles , soaking his pants as he propelled her out of the bathroom , down the hall , and through the den to the front door . Fat pinched and folded across the back of her thighs . Her feet left wet tracks in the carpet . <p> " Get out , " he said . Holding her with one hand , he jerked the front door open . <p> " Howard ! " she screamed . " I do n't have any clothes on ! " <p> Howard did n't reply . He thrust her out into the night , across the concrete stoop and down into the tiny yard below . As she struggled to maintain her balance , she turned to look up at him , her expression shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Silence filled the house . Howard locked the door . <p> Even as he reached the basement stairs , the silence burst like a pustule and noise erupted into the night . <p> " Howard ! Let me in ! Let me in this minute ? <p> Howard shut the basement door and descended the stairs . He sat on the couch and Bethesda 's voice came to him , as incoherent and meaningless as the noise of a distant radio . <p> About him , the tropical fish soared and plunged , visions of beauty behind glass walls . He concentrated on the transformation , trying to conjure up that exquisite pain as gills tore open across his cheeks , as scales pushed up from beneath his flesh , as his legs knotted themselves into a muscled tail . <p> Once , for an instant , he thought he felt that icy numbness , and his heart rose within him . In the flickering half-light he peered anxiously at his arms , waiting for them to billow out around him like sails , at his feet , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing happened and when he shifted his weight , the numbness departed . <p> " Howard ! " he heard Bethesda scream . " Howard ! " <p> Howard glared wildly about his basement hideaway , saw all the tropical fish turning and turning in their glass prisons , and closed his eyes . Safe , he thought . Secure as a fish in a tank . <p> From upstairs he heard the sound of breaking glass . <p> ILLUSTRATION : " WHAT I DID THIS SUMMER .
