In the midst of the most critical political battle of his presidency  --  the down-to-the-wire struggles to push his budget plan through Congress  --  Bill Clinton met in the Oval Office with FORTUNE managing editor Marshall Loeb , senior editor Richard Kirkland , and Washington bureau chief Ann Reilly Dowd . The topic : What comes next . While admitting he currently lacks the votes in the House to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement , the President pledged to take on Ross Perot and win passage of NAFTA this year . On health care reform , he said the big decisions are still to be made but held out hope for ultimately winning over the group that now fears his plan most  --  small business . Most surprising , he called for a national debate  --  once his economic plan and health care reforms are adopted  --  on whether to substitute a progressive value-added tax , or VAT , for lower income or payroll taxes . Excerpts : Mr. President , you have said your economic plan would create eight million jobs over four years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our FORTUNE 500 CEO Poll , say they 're skeptical . Where will those jobs come from and how will your plan help ? Well , first , I do n't think that this economic plan is all we need to do America . We really need a new trade agreement by the end of the year , an new GATT agreement . That will help create jobs . I think NAFTA the North American Free Trade Agreement will be a job creator for America . I think we 've got to continue to try to coordinate our economic policies with Japan and Germany and others . The economic plan is the critical first step , but is also requires a growing global economy , we could create more than eight million jobs because we 're already about 3.5 million to four million behind where we ought to be coming out of the depths of the recession . You can look and see where there will be opportunities for growth . A lot of big companies will continue to restructure and downsize . You 've got IBM , Sears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ; and indeed , I 'm trying to get the federal government to do some of the same . We have n't fundamentally changed our delivery service network in decades , and it 's time to reexamine that . But most of the new jobs will be generated by a resurgent manufacturing sector , which I think you will see , particularly if we get the GATT agreement reducing tariffs no manufactured products . Unlike NAFTA , there is virtually no disagreement that the agreement we reached in Tokyo with the G-7 on manufactured products will create hundreds of thousands of jobs on its own . And of course new manufacturing jobs always give rise to other jobs . In electronics , biotechnology , computer technologies of all kinds , including software and hardware , aerospace  --  which we 're desperately trying to turn around  --  we will get our fair share if we do the right things . Small business generally will continue to be the major job generator , and high tech , and areas concerned with defense conversion , where we have an underutilized but incredibly globally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we get our defense conversion plan . I think the space program will continue to generate new jobs . We 'll also do quite well in a lot of the service industries . So I would say basic manufacturing , the technologies that are producing most of the new jobs in the world at high wages , small business , and high-tech defense conversion in the right areas will produce a lot of new jobs in the 1990s for America  --  if we can keep interest rates down , get the deficit down , train the work force better , and open market . Many small-business people complain that increasing personal taxes will cause them to cut employment . How do you respond ? Most of them borrow money , and they 'll make more from lower interest rates and stable growth they will lose in higher taxes . Even though the economy has been growing , many companies continue to cut employees . Do you think that 's correct behavior , and can anything be done to change it ? Those companies are part of what is now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is having trouble creating new jobs . The Europeans began to see it more in the 1980s than we did , and it may be because they supported their workers more generously , and therefore were n't as flexible . But now we are faced with the prospect of something we all denied throughout the 1980s  --  at least I did . I thought technology would always be a net job creator . It has been throughout the history of this country . But the argument of Lester Thurow 's book Head to Head is that seven major technologies will create the bulk of the high-wage , high-growth jobs of the 21st century , and there 's a finite number of them available So for the first time technology will not be an unmixed blessing . My belief is that Thurow is probably wrong , if  --  but only if  --  three things happen . No. 1 , we continue to expand markets and global growth . I do n't see how a wealthy country grows richer unless poor nations are growing and increasing their capacity to buy the output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a way globally to make economic opportunities out of the strains already present in the world environment , and those that will surely come if we have more growth in other countries . We have to find a way to make preserving the globe good business . The third thing we have to do in America is to become far more efficient  --  although that 's kind of a cold-blooded term  --  in bringing out the best abilities of our people . We still have to many people in this country who do n't function well in the global economy . Too many of them drop out , too many of them are in jail , too many of them do n't compete well for good jobs , too many of them are in inner-city neighborhoods where there 's no enterprise , no investment , and that 's a big drag on our economy . There are a number of other issues , including bringing health costs in line with inflation , that we could talk about , but those are the big three . If we do those things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth . I see that as my great task : to try to position the country for the 21st century in ways that will keep the American Dream alive and rekindle it here at home and permit us to be responsible leaders in the world . Mr. President , many Americans were disappointed that you were unable to deliver the middle-class tax cut you promised during your campaign . Do you still intend to give it to them , and if so , when ? The answer to the first question is yes . The answer to the second question is , it depends on how we do in bringing this deficit down . On the domestic front , being unable to cut middle-class taxes has clearly been my biggest disappointment . Even though I 'm asking for a very modest contribution from families with adjusted gross incomes of more than $30,000 and less than $180,000 , I did n't want to do that . This has been a very painful experience for me . I still think the tax system is out of whack  --  primarily because of high payroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1980s , and the corresponding high consumption tax increases at the state and local level . So the net impact of the 1980s was to impose higher tax burdens on people with essentially stagnant incomes , mainly the middle 60% of the American people . I think that there should be some changes in the tax code that benefit them , especially changes that promote family and work . We are making a huge down payment on that , I might add , by expanding the EITC the Earned Income Tax Credits , which provides rebates to low-income taxpayers . Assuming we keep to our deficit-reduction targets and we get some good growth , we 'll be able to make further changes . Once your economic plan passes , do you think we will need to do still more to shift the tax burden away from investment and onto consumption , and do you have any longer-range plans to do that ? The next huge issue I want to take up is health care . I do n't see how we can be competitive over the long run if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only Canada is over 9% , and everybody else is under that . A lot of health care costs are paid for in ways that deter investment because they are payroll costs , or costs off the top . I hope we can deal with that in a way that is a huge net benefit to small business and to larger employers who are getting creamed by the system . Then the question for America becomes  --  and I think we ought to have a debate on it ; you know , there 's a lot of support already in the Congress  --  whether we should lower either income or payroll taxes and substitute a progressive VAT . We 're not talking about a tax increase ; we 're talking about a net wash . But is there some way to make it a VAT fair to working people and still have one ? One of the things that I 'm very interested in , obviously , is getting our exports up . The VAT is the only internationally recognized , legal way to favor your exports and to impose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . So I think we ought to look at it . It 's not on my screen right now , because I 've got so much else to do . But you know , you 've got Senator Hollings D-South Carolina , you 've got Senator Johnston D-Louisiana , you 've got a lot of people who are very much involved in international trade and have really thought it through , who think we should do it . I just think if it 's done , it has to be wash . You have to give people back something , and it has to be done in a progressive way . It ca n't be another shift of the tax burden down toward the middle class . But there are plainly ways to make it progressive if we do it right . Do you see this as a way of financing health care reform ? No . At least at the present time , I do n't think we need to look at that as a way of financing health care reform . My view has always been that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than other countries ' costs that we ought to be able to find a way to insure the unemployed uninsured  --  which most people see as the government 's responsibility  --  without imposing a new tax on other people who are paying too much already for their health care . So my own view is that unless something unforeseeable happens , we ought to keep these two separate . I really have n't had time to think through my own position , whether I could say right now , yes , let 's do a VAT , let 's lower this income tax or that payroll tax . I just have n't had time to deal with it , but I think the country will have to deal with it in the context of what creates the most jobs . When will you propose health care reform ? Will it be before NAFTA ? And do you think you can get health care through this year ? I think we 'll have a shot . We 've worked this thing so hard for the last several months , bringing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state governors and others to try to help us work through all the various details , that I think we have a chance to pass something this year . I expect to take it up when we 're finished with the budget , the economic program . When we bring NAFTA up in part is a function of when the side agreements are concluded , and when we think there 's any shot to pass it in the House , where we do n't have the votes right now . I think it is inevitable , given the timing , that Congress will have to consider both these issues health care reform and NAFTA in some form or fashion between now and the end of the year . Do you hope to get both passed by then ? That would be wonderful if we did . I think that it 's conceivable . Are you considering a two-step approach to health care , in which you 'd push for modest reforms this year and more comprehensive changes next year ? I have n't made a decision to do that . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . I 'll have to turn my attention to it shortly . I spent hours and hours and hours on health care earlier on in my term . In the last couple of months , I have just been immersed in this economic plan . But it is not inconceivable to me that we will have a proposal which will have an enormous amount of support from the small-business community of this country . Keep in mind that 70% of small businesses in America do insure their employees . The vitality of the small-business sector is one reason we have a lower unemployment rate than all of our competitors except Japan . But we should n't kid ourselves . For the employers and their employees who have no health insurance , everyone else pays a little more than they otherwise would , even for people who do n't use it , because we pay for the infrastructure  --  the doctors ' offices , the hospitals  --  to be there . Most of my friends whom I grew up with are small-business people . Virtually all of them provide some coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they should because they 're not a big enough group . A lot of their employees are victims of job lock . They ca n't change their jobs because of health care . Those are not small things . I 'm also concerned about the fact that we are the only country in the world that has 1,500 separate companies writing health insurance , thousands of different policies . I 've got a friend I grew up with who 's a doctor in the D.C. area , and we were talking about this the other day . He 's had to hire somebody just to stay on the phone all day to do nothing but call all these different insurance companies to try to get them to pay the money that they owe . As a consequence of that bureaucratization of the process  --  which the government is somewhat to blame in too  --  we have gone from a situation where in 1980 the average doctor was taking home about 75 cents on the dollar that came into the clinic , and now it 's down to 63 cents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle is a little bit of malpractice premiums going up , but most of its is increased paperwork . So if you look at the possibilities you have for reforming the financing side of this system , you have a lot of play in there to be more gentle and understanding of the problems of small businesses that ca n't afford a regular policy now . That 's why I think there are some insurance reforms , some financing reforms , that will help win the support of the vast majority of small-business people . But I have n't decided on an approach yet . Can you give us an idea of when universal coverage will be in place and how it will be financed ? I think it will have to be phased in . I do n't think you can just do it in one year . The speed of the phase in depends upon the cost , the range of coverage , how much flexibility we leave to the states , a lot of other decisions that I have n't made a final sign-off on . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How do you turn that around ? Are n't you going to have to take on Ross Perot ? Sure . I 've tried to do that . We 've just been immersed in these other tasks . And not only Ross Perot , but a lot of my friends in the labor movement , all my friends in the Congress from Michigan , Ohio , and all these heartland states that voted for me and gave me the chance to be President . It is very difficult thing . But I 've been the governor of a state where plants closed down and went to Mexico for low wages . I 've seen plants go away , and I 've seen the faces of people who lost their jobs . So I understand that issue very well , and I would make the following points . No. 1 , the people who want to close their plants down and go to Mexico for low wages can do it today . And if they defeat NAFTA , they can continue to do it . The second point is , Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If their incomes go up , they can buy more from us . Last month they displaced the Japanese as the second-biggest purchasers of our manufactured products . Before President Salinas came in , Mexico had a trade surplus with us . Now it has a trade deficit because Salinas unilaterally lowered some tariffs . They 're still higher there than they are here , but that unilateral action has given us a $6 billion trade surplus so far , and it 's good for Mexico , because a lot of stuff we 're selling helps to build their infrastructure and will make them wealthier . Sure , the richer they get , the more they can do for themselves , but also the more money they 'll have to buy goods and services from us . If you look at the roughly one billion people south of our border in Latin America , we ca n't turn away from that . It 's a big deal . It 's potentially great . The third point I would make is that if we walk away from this , and it leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have more instability on the border , more illegal immigration , more displacement of people in this country by illegal immigrants who would otherwise stay home and work and support their families and earn money and buy American products . Now , does that mean there will be no job displacement ? Of course not . There will be some job displacement , but there is job displacement every day in America and has been from the dawn of time . What we want is more winners than losers . The question in all these tough choices should be , Will we generate more jobs and higher income , net ? Because if we close all the borders tomorrow , we 'd still have economic dislocation because we live in dynamic times . The average 18-year-old worker will change work eight times a lifetime . No politician can promise to stop the change , and anybody who pretends to be able to do that is wrong . So will you have a full court press on NAFTA ? There will be a good campaign on this . One of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the American people that a lot of these issues are highly complex . They 're not simple , but we have to change , we have to move forward . Let 's lower our voices and talk to each other . I think we 'll make the right decisions on health care , on NAFTA , if we can learn to reestablish a sort of communal sense , cut through all these rockets and bombs that have been going off around these issues , and sit down and talk to each other as neighbors . That 's one of the things that eventually we started doing , a little bit , on the gays in the military thing . In the end , we had people visiting with one another and talking . I think that part of my job in a time of churning change is to get people not to scream at each other but to literally sit down and try to work through these things . This goes back to the question you asked me  --  I did n't ever answer the second half  --  when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those plant ? There 's no question in my mind that some American businesses have for purposes of short-term profit shortchanged their workers . They 've either laid them off in a cold-blooded way , or depressed their wages and benefits while the managers raised their own pay . There was way too much short-term profit-taking at the expense of workers ' interest in the 1980s . But that does n't explain all this downturn in a big company payrolls . Some of it absolutely had to be done . And what we are seeing is that over the long run , the companies that win are going to be the ones who treat their workers like partners , who involve them in the company to give them a sense of ownership in the enterprise , and who understand that that 's the most important asset we 've got . Those enterprises that just take their money and run will endure as well as those where the workers are taken care of , where they share in the bonuses  --  non-union companies like Nucor Steel , where the workers earn weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Nucor loses money , everybody takes a cut across the board , and the managers take a bigger cut than the workers . Those are the folks who are going to be around and survive in the long run . The unions in order to survive are also going to have to be part of success stories . That is , workers will want to be in a union and management will view it in a positive way if they see it as a partner in generating growth and opportunity . That 's really what we 've got to work for in the American economy . Any concluding message for the business leaders of the country , Mr. President ? This Administration is committed to doing things that are good for business . The private sector creates the jobs . The economic program has been difficult for me to advocate , I would say , because of the taxes . But I think it 's the right thing to do  --  to take a real bite out of the deficit , to keep interest rates down , and to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth . And it is the first step in what I hope will be a long-term partnership with the business community to restore the real vitality of the American economy , and to solve this riddle about job creation which is gripping every advanced nation in the world . <p>
