KIDS AND RITALIN <P> " Great advances in society have frequently come from the so-called misfits . Where will such ideas be found in the world of Ritalin ? " MICHAEL M. MAKIEVE Alamo , Calif . <P> Your article on Ritalin as the wonder drug for the hyper child is not only scary but also sad THE AGE OF RITALIN , Nov. 30 . Throughout my successful academic years , I was surrounded by a variety of students , many of whom were deemed hyperactive at a young age but each of whom managed to get into a top college . Strict parental discipline was the daily medication : no TV , no video games . I do believe there are children who have problems that require drug intervention , but forcing children to be dependent on a drug to regulate their behavior merely reflects society 's unwillingness to take responsibility for its actions . There are too many unknowns to be prescribing this drug so broadly to children . PRADNYA PARULEKAR Troy , Mich . <P> Our son has **31;7423;TOOLONG disorder for which he receives Ritalin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of impulse control can affect a child and his family . Our son was one month away from his fifth birthday when we realized we needed help . He incinerated food in the microwave , turned off the hot-water heater and opened the water-release valve , forced several steak knives through a wooden fence and finally bloodied a pet . Does this sound like an unsupervised child ? I am home full time with him , and vigilance was the key word . Even with all the unanswered questions and skepticism surrounding this disorder , our son has done extraordinarily well since taking Ritalin . JANET TAYLOR Pismo Beach , Calif . <P> Every time I hear the name Ritalin I do a slow burn . My parents put me on the drug when I was eight . It was pretty much the doctor saying , " He 's hyperactive , " my parents agreeing and the doctor whipping out the prescription pad . For the next six years , my parents told me I was taking a vitamin supplement . I 'm still paying for what this garbage did to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen true , medically hyperactive kids . I was n't one of them . What kind of society is it in which so many of us take the easiest option and drug our children with a substance we do n't yet fully understand ? THOMAS WHEELER Tucson , Ariz . <P> I am a 36-year-old adult who has only recently discovered the **31;7456;TOOLONG disorder model . It completely explains so many lifelong obstacles and difficulties and some successes . I believe that I most certainly would have benefited from this tool of chemical therapy during my childhood . It could have greatly diminished the emotional turmoil suffered by me , my parents and my siblings . My advice to parents today : consider all options ; keep looking for solutions until you find something that works for you . ERIK CLARK Myersville , Md . <P> Today 's brave new world has its own version of Soma : Ritalin . The list of behaviors that help determine if a child is hyperactive and a candidate for Ritalin is a list of behaviors all children exhibit at one time or another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen , sit still , concentrate and be patient and responsible . I fear what sort of adults these medicated children will become . MARY MANCINELLI South Lyon , Mich.
