<p> Linda Russell can not reach into her daughter 's mind to understand why she drove her little boys to the top of a boat ramp , released the emergency brake and sent them to their deaths strapped in the back seat of her car . <p> So she drives the roads that Susan Smith drove that October night in 1994 trying to fathom a depression so bottomless that it could lead to murder . <p> " Put her in a dark car , on a dark road , for mile after mile after mile , " Russell said driving the desolate highway one recent evening . " The longer she drove , the more lonely she felt . She lost touch with reality . " <p> Russell knew that her daughter was upset that day . She was distraught over her broken marriage and her recently dashed romance with a wealthy lover . Smith 's life had always been a highway of heartache , from her father 's suicide to her twisted relationship with her stepfather , Russell 's then-husband , Beverly . <p> But had Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill her kids ? Russell has pondered that question for four years , only now understanding enough to find a little peace . <p> For the first time since a jury convicted her daughter of murder , Russell is talking publicly about the ghastly textile-town tragedy that sent chills down America 's spine . Divorced now and selling the brick ranch house where Smith grew up , the 54-year-old grandmother who has been portrayed as cold , controlling and hard-edged is showing her emotional scars , sharing her pain and trying to move on . <p> She recently began attending meetings to organize the Union County chapter of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill , a group that helps families deal with mental illness . <p> " What does the average person know about mental illness or depression ? " Russell said . " I think it is time we do have a national debate or talk . " <p> But Russell said she 's not yet willing to participate if it means accepting invitations from Oprah Winfrey or some of the other national TV programs that have asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to believe that they care about Susan or me , " Russell said . " I think my family has been exploited enough . " <p> In faded jeans and a neatly pressed denim shirt , Russell seems as tightly wound as a bobbin of yarn . Her silver-framed glasses sit atop her neatly styled gray hair . She wears a gold chain with a small cross and dove , hinting at the solace she said she 's found in prayer . <p> Still , Russell is bound up in grief and anger . She 's angry at Smith 's ex-husband and at the prosecutor who sought the death penalty against her daughter . She is suspicious of the media and anyone else nosing around her family . <p> Over the span of a balmy October afternoon , Russell slowly , hesitantly , unwrapped her emotions . <p> Her 27-year-old daughter is mentally ill , Russell said , and belongs in a hospital , not in the Women 's Correctional Institution in Columbia where she is serving a life sentence . She will be eligible for parole on Nov. 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deaths of Michael , 3 , and Alex , 14 months . <p> Russell regularly visits her daughter , a former textile mill secretary now identified as inmate No. 221487 . Smith does clerical work for teachers in the prison , where she lives in the general population and receives counseling and the anti-depressant Prozac . <p> If Smith 's depression had been diagnosed and she had been taking Prozac , Russell said , her daughter never would have killed her sons . <p> " She is not a bad person . She loved her children , " Russell said . " Something as simple as a pill could have made so much of a difference in so many lives . " For the most part , life has returned to normal in Union , a Bible-belt town of 10,000 between Spartanburg and Columbia . The boat ramp at John D. Long Lake is gone , ripped up after a freak accident in 1996 . Seven people drowned when their car apparently slipped into gear and rolled into the water . <p> The crowds visiting the stone monuments to Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly to fishermen . <p> This is the fourth fall since the boys ' murder . A crisp coolness fills the Piedmont forest , dabbed with the fiery colors of sundown . But a sadness lingers . Michael would have turned 7 on Oct. 10 . All that remains are pictures and clothes and toys . The black-and-red plastic lawn mower he pushed around his grandmother 's back yard is tucked away , dusty , on the screened back porch . <p> The healing has been slow for Russell in a house surrounded by memories of her grandsons and their mother . " Almost instantly , one-half of my grandchildren were gone ; one-third of my children were jerked away , " said Russell , flicking her left hand as if shooing away a fly . <p> Rocking slowly on her back-porch swing , Russell smokes Salem Lights and drinks coffee from a mug . It 's the same place she sat , stunned and silent , on the night of Nov. 3 , 1994 , after learning that two of her grandchildren were dead and their mother had been charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what she 'll never see again . <p> Michael picked tomatoes and green peppers in a garden that 's now brown except for a splash of powdery blue flowers . His little legs pumped the pedals of his tricycle , speeding around and around on the cool blue concrete floor . He 'd stop , turn the bike upside down and cry out " fix it " as his tiny hands worked busily with make-believe tools . <p> " I miss them , " said Russell , wiping her eyes . " I rocked them and fed them and bathed them and played with them hours on end . When I ache to hold them , I can only . . . I hurt that much worse because no matter how bad I wanted to hold them , it could n't be anything compared to what Susan wanted to . " <p> Russell ca n't bear the thought of Michael and Alex 's last moments . It is excruciatingly painful to picture them sinking , strapped in car seats as the inky water of John D. Long Lake filled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes before . After Smith confessed , ending nine days of lying about her sons ' whereabouts , divers returned to the lake and found the decomposing bodies 18 feet down . <p> Not once since then has Russell gone to the lake or visited the nearby monuments . Nor has she pressed her daughter for details about that moment on the boat ramp . <p> " Do you know what Susan told me ? That she thought the Lord had lifted that car and put it somewhere . And ( the children ) were somewhere and they were safe and if they could just find where he had put it , she could have her children back . " <p> In the nearly 3 1/2 years since Smith was found guilty of murder , Russell said she has begun to understand the silent devastation of mental illness . " Obviously you have to say that Susan was responsible for their deaths , " she said . " But who was responsible for what happened along the way that got her in that mental shape ? " <p> When Russell travels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the lonely road echoed and emphasized her daughter 's dark isolation . As she often did , Russell had invited her daughter to come to her house that night to feed and bathe the boys . Russell had gone to another grandson 's football game , and she came home around 8 p.m . Smith had not shown up . <p> Instead , the young mother drove aimlessly down S.C . 215 , the two-lane road between Union and Carlisle . She was deeply troubled over her failed marriage to David Smith and the abrupt end of her romance with Tom Findlay . Findlay was the son of her wealthy boss , J. Cary Findlay , who controlled one of Union 's biggest companies , decorative-tassel manufacturer Conso Products Inc . <p> State prosecutor Tommy Pope tried to convince the jury that Smith drowned her sons in hopes of winning back Tom Findlay , who had told her in a letter that he was n't interested in a ready-made family . Russell said her daughter knew that Findlay was not interested in marriage . Instead , Russell blames her daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith . " Susan had filed for divorce on the grounds of adultery , and he was trying to get her back , " Russell said . " He played mind games with her . I do not think he realized how far he was pushing her . " David Smith , who worked recently for Winn-Dixie in Spartanburg , could not be reached for comment . Neither could his father , C. David Smith in Pensacola , Fla . <p> In his 1995 book , " Beyond All Reason  --  My Life With Susan Smith , " David Smith admitted to cheating on his wife , while accusing her of cheating on him . His portrayal of his mother-in-law was unflattering , accusing Russell of interfering with the marriage . After his wife had filed for divorce , Smith wrote , he was so angry that he arranged for his girlfriend , Tiffany Moss , to follow Susan Smith around in hopes of catching her with another man . <p> " Could it be that somehow what Susan did was a product of all that catting around and foolishness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world sneak around on each other , lie to each other , and do each other dirt . But no one kills their children . No one murders their babies . " <p> Russell believes that nobody realized how desperately alone her daughter felt . She tries to imagine how Smith felt driving that night . <p> Kudzu-draped trees loomed like ghosts in the darkness along S.C . 215 . Smith turned left at the stop sign in Carlisle , dimly lighted by the glow of the L'il Cricket convenience store , and she plunged again into the darkness of the Sumter National Forest . <p> " The further she drove and the longer she drove , the more isolated she felt , " Russell said . <p> Smith crossed the Broad River , drove a while and turned around . She stopped on the bridge , got out of her car and contemplated jumping into the black rocky river . Michael cried out in the back seat , jarring his mother back from the brink , and she drove back to Union . <p> Even then she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles away . She wound up on the other side of Union , parked at the top of the steep boat ramp at John D. Long Lake . Russell believes she intended to kill herself and her boys . But she got out and released the emergency brake . <p> The car hit the water , floated for an estimated six minutes , and sank . <p> For the next nine days , Smith lied , playing the part of the stricken mother . She told police , her family and the nation that a black gunman had stolen her car . She painted a pitiful portrait of herself , stranded and screaming , " I love y'all " as her sons disappeared down the dark road . Russell said she never suspected that her daughter was lying , or that she might have killed the boys . " You know , I do n't even like that word , " Russell said . After the truth came out , people recoiled at Smith 's lying . Russell said , " If you go back and look at those interviews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Everyone of them . <p> " How was Susan going to explain the unexplainable ? " Russell said . " If you could say there was a motive , in her awful state of mind , it was her love of Michael and Alex . <p> " How can you make anybody understand that you love somebody so much that you just give them to Jesus ? " Russell said . " That nobody is ever going to hurt them anymore and that they are going to be safe . " <p> Russell believes that only those who have been in the depth of depression could understand . <p> " How can you rationally explain the irrational mind ? " she said . " Only somebody who has reached the point where they have totally lost it , where they 've had an emotional breakdown , can understand it . " <p> Russell said she finds affirmation in the phone calls she receives from strangers , some who call in the early hours of the morning . They want to talk about how their mental illnesses almost pushed them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hears from people who want to share their problems . <p> " I identified with your situation so much because there were many times when I knew that the only way to end my pain was to kill myself , " a 45-year-old woman from Pennsylvania wrote Smith in August . Doctors " had drummed into me how damaging it was to a child if a parent killed theirself , " the woman wrote . " So in my desperate and sick mind , I figured that I would have to kill my daughter , too . It made sense at the time . " <p> Smith mailed the letter to her mother and asked her to keep it . <p> Russell still begrudges the media for treating her family " like bugs under a microscope " during the July 1995 trial . <p> " I think it was easier for the news media to make it into a soap opera than delve into the complicated issues , " she said . In the trial , defense lawyers called Smith 's relatives and friends to testify that Smith had suffered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was 6 . She attempted suicide by aspirin when she was 13 and again at 18 . She was hospitalized after the second incident . <p> " During Susan 's trial , when the doctor said Susan was mentally ill , that hurt . Well , I wo n't even say hurt , " Russell said . " It was shock . All of the things that I had been through with Susan . . . . Here was a name for it . I had not even thought that Susan might be mentally ill . " <p> At times , Smith seemed a normal teenager , voted friendliest girl in Union High School 's senior class in 1989 . Her mother always thought she 'd work through her problems . <p> " Susan was the only daughter I had , " Russell said . " And I did n't have another daughter to compare . You live with things as they come along . It 's like dealing with one thing , and by the time you think things are all right , here comes something else . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Russell 's second husband , Beverly , took the stand and apologized for having sexual relations with his stepdaughter until three months before she drowned her sons . <p> Their relations had begun when Smith was 15 . The family got counseling , but the inappropriate relations resumed after Smith had turned 16 . A counselor told Linda Russell , " Susan 's in love with Bev . " <p> " What do you do when you have a 16 1/2-year-old who thinks she is in love with your husband ? " Russell said . <p> Rather than divorce her husband , Russell said , she decided to keep the family together as her way of protecting her daughter . She feared that if her husband lived elsewhere , her daughter could drive to see him and escalate the intimate nature of their relationship . <p> The Russells called off an investigation by the sheriff 's office , which had been contacted by the local social services agency . <p> " I mean if Susan had been 4 or 5 , I probably would have killed him , " Russell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best thing to do . . . by not allowing it to be beyond my control . " <p> Linda Russell said she separated from her husband in early 1995 , after she learned about the extent of his relations with her daughter . Their divorce became final in September . They agreed to sell the home where they raised Smith and her two brothers . <p> Russell has n't been able to finish the task of sorting through Michael and Alex 's belongings . She has given away some of the clothing , but she said , " You could only stand to do so much . " <p> She has put a few special things  --  some toys , a pair of shoes , a baby book  --  in an antique cedar chest . She 's also tucked in some of her daughter 's memorabilia , including her childhood ballet slippers . <p> " It is a chest full of remembrances of three lives , " Russell said softly as the porch swing creaked in a sad rhythm . " That 's her chest .
