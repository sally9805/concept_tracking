Sometimes talk is healing . sometimes silence works better . So at 9:02 a.m. on Wednesday , exactly one week from the moment of the explosion that tore apart hundreds of lives , Oklahoma City came to another halt . Gathered at what used to be the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building , rescue teams briefly stopped picking through the wreckage and stood in quiet reflection . All over the city people bowed their heads . Outside of town , traffic stopped along Interstate 40 . Beyond , in towns and cities around the country , in churches and offices and in the White House , the same pause was observed . For one minute , the unspeakable was commemorated by the unspoken . <P> It 's too soon to tell whether the Oklahoma City bombing will also be a transforming moment in our national life , one of those episodes that make us take stock of ourselves and what it means to be an American . It 's already plain that the explosion did more than just remind us that terrorism happens . In a nation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the radio and the campaign trail , the inflamed rhetoric of the ' 90s is suddenly an unindicted co-conspirator in the blast . As for antigovernment sentiment , so long as Americans are fretful about Washington-for that matter , so long as Americans are Americans-it wo n't go away . How it 's expressed , however , is now subject to reconsideration . Then there 's the gun lobby , which only a few weeks ago was basking in its renewed clout in Congress . For a while at least , it 's once more on the defensive . And if high passion itself becomes less fashionable , the reverberations may even extend to single-issue politics on topics like abortion . <P> In their attempt to fathom the bombers ' motives , many Americans discovered just how deep the paranoia runs among a small minority of their countrymen . It was easy to laugh at the wackier notions , uttered by the most normal-looking people speaking in reasoned tones : Russian troops are hidden in salt mines under Detroit waiting for their orders , the U.N . has a secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gangs . What was less easy to dismiss were those Americans who realize Janet Reno is not a paid agent of Jewish Colombian drug lords but who nonetheless are so deeply alienated from their government that they view it as their enemy . Most are not violent people , and many of them have understandable grievances about feeling left behind in the economic competition of the 1990s.
