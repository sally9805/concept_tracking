<p> This is a city of regulated routine . It does not usually teem : not with dignitaries , like those about to assemble at the Presidents ' Summit for America 's Future , and certainly not with opera . <p> Until Friday , that is , when Opera Fest Philadelphia started . It is a two-week event celebrating the 400th anniversary of the birth of the art form , in Italy , and this city 's legacy as the birthplace of American opera , with the anonymous publication here of Andrew Barton 's two-act comedy , ' The Disappointment , " in 1767 . The festival offers performances of Verdi 's " Falstaff " by the Opera Company of Philadelphia , Cavalli 's " Ormindo " by the Curtis Institute of Music , John Duffy 's " Black Water " by the American Music Theater Festival and Richard Wargo 's " Chekhov Trilogy " by the Academy of Vocal Arts . Everything , alas , but " The Disappointment . " <p> The festival has also attracted to the city the 27th annual conference of Opera America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General sessions start on Monday at the Doubletree Hotel , across from the historic Academy of Music , and run through Wednesday . <p> The conference is in danger of turning into a party . Such affairs usually project a certain forced cheeriness , however drab or dire the workaday realities . But here there is ample cause for optimism . Indeed , at a time of perceived crisis in the American classical-music world , opera seems somehow exempt , living a charmed life . <p> " Opera 's audience is growing , and it is also growing younger , " Marc A. Scorca , the president of Opera America , said on Wednesday from the organization 's headquarters in Washington . <p> Opera America 's latest overall attendance figure for opera performances in the United States and Canada , 7.1 million for the 1994-95 season , represented approximately a 10 percent increase over the previous season . And figures from the National Endowment for the Arts show an increase of almost 25 percent in the American opera audience from 1982 to 1992 . All of this during a period in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof ) that audiences for classical music in America are aging and declining . <p> True , there have always been some people eager to read opera out of the normal run of classical music , often for unsympathetic reasons . " To write a successful opera a knowledge of harmony and counterpoint is not enough , " H. L. Mencken wrote in 1920 . " One must also be a sort of Barnum . " He added , " An opera may have plenty of good music in it and fail , but if it has a good enough show it will succeed . " <p> In some ways the show , if not always the singing , may be better than ever just now , with greater attention paid to theatrical values . And at a time when even traditionally staid classical-music institutions are beginning to grasp at Barnum , when multimedia is king in the culture at large , opera comes with a broad appeal built in . <p> " The art form has some intrinsic resonance with the popular music videos that the young people are watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down to watch some music videos , I have been struck by the mixture of music and words and visual images , not in a specific marriage of image to word and word to music but in a large , sweeping fusion of these elements into a big emotional message . " <p> Opera 's appeal to the youth market is indeed anomalous , as figures compiled by the National Endowment in 1992 confirm . Opera , they show , was the only one of the traditional performing arts to have grown in attendance in the age group 18 to 24 over the previous decade : an 18 percent increase despite a 16 percent decline in the individuals in that group . <p> Mr. Scorca 's recourse to pop music itself illustrates what he called a " huge demystification " of the medium . Perhaps the biggest factor in demystifying opera has been the use of titles for works in foreign languages and even in English . <p> " They 've changed the experience of opera , and I think most of that change is for the good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooperstown , N.Y. , for 18 years and is now the managing director of the New York City Opera . " I really believe that the development of supertitles is in large measure responsible for the development of the audience currently coming to the opera . The coincidence is too great . " <p> For good or ill , demystification takes other forms as well . As a matter of course nowadays , opera is ripped from the headlines , often with a sensationalist tinge . Recent examples have included John Adams 's " Death of Klinghoffer , " Stewart Wallace 's " Harvey Milk " and Michael Daugherty 's " Jackie O. " " Black Water , " a work by Mr. Duffy and the novelist Joyce Carol Oates loosely based on the 1969 drowning incident at Chappaquiddick , Mass. , is receiving its premiere production here this week . ( It is probably not a stop on the Presidents ' tour . ) <p> In addition , the medium has more or less infiltrated popular culture , in everything from Three Tenors concerts to operatically scaled musicals . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco Opera seems to confirm what the current Broadway rock hit " Rent " suggests , that the work is a particular favorite of young audiences . In fact , especially outside major cities , the current operatic surge is rooted in the standard European warhorses : the very thing orchestras are now lambasted for resorting to . <p> As often as not in commercials , opera is a foil , roundly mocked for its stereotypical absurdities . But at least its name is spelled right . <p> " There is a whole new climate " for opera in this country , two panelists said in identical terms at a recent forum , " The Fat Lady Sings On : Behind the Opera Boom , " at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts . The panelists agreed on little else except to lament the byproducts of heightened commercialization in , for example , the " manufactured career " of the young French tenor Roberto Alagna . <p> North America , to be sure , has been experiencing an opera boom for some time . More than half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scorca said , have entered the organization since 1970 , more than two-thirds since 1960 . <p> " Opera is still new in this country , " Mr. Scorca said , Philadelphia 's early start notwithstanding . " The growth in audience is a result , for one thing , of access to live-performance opportunities that may not have existed 5 or 10 years ago . " <p> It is worth recalling that American orchestras enjoyed a similar boom for 25 years or so , until harder times set in a decade ago . And it is also true that even in boom times , nothing is ever easy in the arts . Long-range growth and a fresh wave of excitement do not necessarily translate directly into dollars . <p> In any discussion of finances among American opera companies , it should be recognized , as Opera America does in some of its statistics , that there is the Metropolitan Opera , with its annual budget of $160 million and an endowment of $145 million , and there is everyone else . <p> " It 's almost an oxymoron to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such thing , " said Mr. Kellogg , with a current annual budget of $27 million and no endowment at the City Opera . " The Met , of course , does n't have any problem at all . But most opera companies in the country have problems , perhaps not constant but certainly periodic , because it 's just so expensive . In today 's funding climate , there 's no way of avoiding crisis from time to time . It 's the nature of the game . " <p> Joseph Volpe , the general manager of the Met , disagrees about his " problemless " operation . And at the City Opera , crisis has been more constant than periodic over the last decade , but Mr. Kellogg announced with pride that the company would end its current year with a balanced budget . An even larger outlay is in the offing , he said , " to beef up artistic standards . " <p> Mr. Scorca spoke for the rest of the country : " By and large , opera companies are doing fairly well financially . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , roughly half of the companies incur a deficit , and roughly half incur a surplus . The fact that the companies are surviving and growing is an indication that the same ones are n't incurring those deficits year after year . " <p> Opera America figures show that its member companies derive just over half of their income from the box office and other sources of revenue . The rest must be raised through contributions , some 40 percent of that money coming from individuals . <p> Several company directors cited the stock market boom as a major factor in the current fund-raising climate . Despite cutbacks by public agencies and heightened competition from social and humanitarian causes , the financial situation remains basically healthy for opera . <p> " Given the number of opera companies in the world today and the number of symphony orchestras , " Mr. Volpe of the Met said , " if you boil it all down , I guess people are finding it easier to fund-raise for opera companies than for symphonies , because why else would there be a discrepancy ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . People get much more excited in an opera house than in a concert hall , and that 's why they 're here . It 's as simple as that . " <p> Even in better days of the National Endowment for the Arts , the awards were valuable as much for cachet as for the piddling amounts involved . Most opera companies have weathered the reduction or elimination of grants in financial terms . <p> Matters are different in Europe , where arts institutions are dependent on far larger subsidies , which are in many cases being drastically reduced . The Scottish National Opera recently lost 90 percent of its grant from the Arts Council of Britain , and the Royal Opera has canceled plans for some new productions . <p> As the London retrenchment illustrates , the very complexity of opera presentation that makes for such an unwieldy financial situation in the first place also allows for a certain flexibility in times of crisis . Every area of expenditure is an area for potential cutbacks . Productions may be scuttled , simplified or carried out with other houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and choristers , so the musical scale may be altered . <p> But stopgaps carry their own risks . And here is where opera may be separating itself from the rest of the classical-music world . <p> " The problem is the theory that if things are bad , you have to cut back , " Mr. Volpe said from his comfortable position at the Met . " The Met used to do that , too , canceling productions . You ca n't cut back on your product . You have to keep raising the money and doing more . <p> " People in the symphonic world are setting up an atmosphere that 's not very exciting , and I think that has a lot to do with their problems . Ticket buyers do n't want to hear that there 's a financial crisis , and they 'll get less than they expected . They want more than they expected . " <p> To judge from recent past results and immediate prospects , operagoers have been getting just that . <p> Graph : " Healthy Times For Opera " lists some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a service organization , in the U.S. and Canada .
