My feet were finally starting to get warm , so I knew that it would be time to get out soon . It always happened : as soon as the car heated up enough that you could no longer see your breath , it was time to get out . I looked up at the stone , hardwood and glass structure that was to be the place of my education for the next four years and then back at my father sitting beside me in the driver 's seat . He raised both eyebrows in silent encouragement . I nodded in silent discouragement , then cracked open the car door and stepped out . <p> The wind immediately smacked me a good one across the face . The air was so cold that inhaling it made my windpipe ache . And the tiny , airborne spikes of ice made it feel like I had just walked face-first into a pincushion . Yeah , Rochester in January , my kind of town . <p> I pulled my head deeper into my new J. C. Penney overcoat and slipped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thirty feet without breaking my neck . Matt Henson would have been proud . <p> I stepped inside the school and just stood there with my arms folded , eyes closed and face down inside my coat collar , savoring the heat . The cold had temporarily relieved me of my other worries . As I opened my eyes , they all came back to me . I was looking down , but hell , the goddamned floor told the whole story : glazed Italian tile . What kind of school had glazed Italian tile ? This kind , that 's what . This was the Clarendon School for Young Men and Women , the Big Time . This was the place that was supposed to make me buckle down and work to my potential . This was the place where I could rub elbows with the sons and daughters of the captains of industry . This was the place for which I had been dragged off the hallowed linoleum of public school . Most importantly , this was the place for which Mom and Dad had just shelled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " <p> I looked down the hall at the students crossing from classroom to classroom , greeting old friends , updating gossip and comparing new schedules . As I watched them , the blood started rushing through my ears , and it seemed like I had seashells on either side of my head . It was becoming difficult to breathe and I was suddenly hot . The sign on the door in front of me said " Gentlemen , " so I promoted myself and walked in . The room was empty . I had stood in the hallway watching the students at the other end near the classrooms for a good five minutes , but only now , as I stood in front of the mirror , did I see a black face . I nodded to it and muttered shakily , " You and me against the world . " <p> I shrugged out of my overcoat and laid it on the spotless white shelf above the row of spotless white sinks . I thought of the walk-in germ cultures that constituted lavatories in public school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned back to the mirror , looked at myself , and began to grin . The rule at Clarendon was that you had to wear a coat and tie at all times , unless , of course , you were a girl , in which case you had to wear the uniform . Well , that was the rule , and it did n't say you could n't jazz it up a little . I had decided to get decked out for my debut . I had selected a green polyester three-piece suit with flared lapels , a yellow acetate shirt , wide tie , and brown bubble-toed shoes with three-inch heels . As I straightened my tie , my confidence started to rise . Yes sir , I was a class act . I knew that anyone who dressed this well , they 'd have to take seriously . I did a couple of quick turns to check myself from various angles , the woven plastic sparkling in the fluorescent light . I looked sensational . Smiling , I grabbed my overcoat and headed for the door , all fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bastards would know exactly where I was coming from . <p> When I stepped into the hallway , I noticed that most of the students were gone . I checked my watch and saw that it was approximately thirty-four seconds until the start of homeroom . Part of the Clarendon attitude was that responsible young men and women should n't need bells to learn punctuality . I hurriedly searched my pocket for the schedule I had received in the mail the previous week . I found my homeroom assignment and began checking the numbers on doors . The last thing in the world I wanted was to show up C.P.T. C.P.T. is standard Colored People Time . It differs from regular time in that you arrive late as hell . If I walked in late , I just knew what they 'd all be saying to themselves : " Leave it to the spade to shuffle in late . Probably too dumb to find the room . " Personally , I 've never been late for anything in my life and I sport a 149 IQ . They 'd find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good six seconds to spare . My hand trembled for an instant as I reached for the doorknob . Okay , here we go , spooks at Clarendon  --  the end of civilization as we know it . ( Actually , blacks had been admitted to Clarendon for twelve years , but only at the rate of about one every two or three years , just so the school could say it was integrated . I felt a little like a hardcore bus rider  --  no cash , just a token . My rationalization was that I was as intellectually qualified as anyone there , so I need n't take any guff about being the beneficiary of affirmative action . ) I took a deep breath . My chickenshit confidence once again fled , but fortunately it left its bearing behind . I threw back my shoulders and strolled into the room like King Shit . <p> My loyal subjects ignored me . They were talking among themselves and did n't see me come in . So much for grand entrances . I took a moment to survey the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the far side , fluorescent lights overhead , a vacant hardwood desk for the teacher , metal paddle-board jobs for the students . I then gave my new classmates the once-over . And they say we look all alike ; these guys were almost indistinguishable from one another . They were all wearing navy wool blazers or brown tweed jackets and bone , gray or tan corduroy pants , every one of them . Their hair varied only in color , from dark blond to dark brown . Each haircut was the same  --  short on the sides , long on the top with a well-defined part extending from one temple . Not exactly the height of fashion . Somehow I was not surprised by the lack of Afros . I sighed and while doing so gently lowered and shook my head . That 's when I saw what I 'll call their shoes , for want of a better term . They were rubber boots , or rather almost boots . I mean they looked like boots right up until the ankle , and then it looked like someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laced leather to the rubber . They looked functional for this type of climate , so long as you did n't step in too deep a puddle , but now class was about to start and these guys had n't changed into their dress shoes yet . You 'd have thought they would 've done so when they hung up their coats . <p> About half of the students sat at desks reading or sorting through books . The other half was clustered around one guy who was apparently enthralling his friends with a grand anecdote of some sort . He was tall , somewhat handsomer than the others , and cocky as hell . I could tell by the way he was speaking  --  quietly but intently , without any histrionics  --  that he thought a lot of himself and/or his story . From the looks of those around him , they were just as impressed with him as he was with himself . Apparently the BMOC had been long-established . <p> I decided to find a seat , so I moved forward into the room . I saw an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the congregation . As I began to move toward the group , I could hear Joe Pro 's story : " . . . like he 's real tough or something . So I tell him , ' Hey , I reserved this court last week . I always use this court . ' So he shoves me . Major mistake . So then I decked him . Then he starts crying , saying , ' Oh , do n't hit me anymore , man . Please ? I 'm sorry . ' Shit , I was so pissed I took his fucking racket and smashed it against the court . Shattered the fucking frame . You should have seen his face . " <p> He apparently finished his story as I approached him from behind , trying to get over to the empty desk , because he stopped speaking and stepped back , away from the group , but right into me . <p> " Hey ! " He wheeled around to see who had dared jostle him . His initial expression of scorn lasted only a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an instant and his pupils dilated like those of a cat pitched into darkness . His expression was then blank for a while , then his brow furrowed , then his eyebrows raised and then his eyes widened again , all within about a half a second . He then shifted his gaze to the members of his recent audience . I looked over at them , too . Some were looking me up and down , but most were et various stages of the facial-expression series their leader had just gone through . The BMOC quickly turned back to me and began apologizing . <p> " Uh , hey , man , I 'm sorry . Really sorry . I did n't see you . You okay ? I 'm really sorry . " I was embarrassed by his excessive apology and at suddenly being the center of attention . I just wanted to get over to that desk and sit down . <p> I nodded and muttered an " Uh-huh . " My throat was dry from nerves and the hour of the day and the words came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As the BMOC stepped aside , I walked to my desk . As I did so , I noticed from the corner of my eye several students looking at one another and shrugging . <p> I sat there for a while until someone shouted , " Hey , Josh ! " I looked around in time to see a thin , blond , curly-headed student come through the door . He was wearing white denim jeans , a wrinkled gray sport coat of an unidentifiable fabric and Adidas sneakers , and carrying a backpack over one shoulder . He acknowledged the greeting , then scanned the room , his eyes lighting on me . His eyebrows raised and a small grin curled one corner of his mouth . I knew it ! A liberal ! That 's all I needed . <p> Josh bent down to the person seated at the desk nearest the door , asked him something , and got a shrug for a reply . Josh himself then shrugged and began winding his way through the desks , moving toward me . He approached my desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Josh closed his fingers around the base of my thumb , then quickly slid them down and enclosed my palm and , finally , crooked his fingers and locked them with mine , like two trains coupling . It was the latest " soul shake . " I myself had only recently learned it . I guessed that Josh paid very close attention when watching Soul Train . <p> He introduced himself and for the next five minutes grilled me for my story . I answered patiently , revealing no more than absolutely necessary and not offering to clarify faulty inferences . Yes , I lived in the city ( no mention of the neighborhood , Oat Hill , a.k.a. the Ghetto ) . Yes , I had gone to public school ( I failed to mention the three years I had spent in a private grammar school ) . I was transferring from Davidson High ( I left out that I did not live in the Davidson district , but that my mother had gone down to the City School District offices and pulled strings , cords , ropes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harding . Harding was a little like Attica , except that Attica had a better class of inmate . Davidson was rough , but not that rough . It was known as a basketball factory because of its success in that sport , often achieved with players smuggled out of the Harding district , though I was not one ) . Yes , it was strange to be transferring between semesters , but my parents had wanted me to enroll in Clarendon as soon as possible ( no point in mentioning that my folks had just then managed to scrape together enough for tuition ) . <p> As I occasionally looked away from the conversation , I saw what was happening . Josh and I were the only ones talking . The rest of the class sat listening . Josh was interviewing me while the class served as a panel of interested observers . From one public conversation the class would know all about me , and from them the school would know . <p> The conversation broke up as the teacher strolled into the room . He was in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bulk of the people in the room . He apologized for being late . Scuttling in just behind him and immediately taking a seat in the back was a slight , bespectacled Oriental wearing the standard school garb . I tried to catch his eye in a gesture of minority recognition , but the Asian did n't seem to see me or , if he did , he did n't acknowledge it . He seemed to have inscrutability down pat . Someone spoke to the teacher as he approached the desk . <p> " Tough one last night , eh , Coach ? " <p> " They were murdering us with the transition game , " sighed the coach . He apparently directed one of the sports teams . I was n't sure which one . " We were n't getting back on the break at all . And our free-throw shooting was atrocious . " Oh , I thought , free throngs . He must be the basketball coach . <p> The coach tossed an attendance book on his desk and turned and saw me seated right in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of facial expressions except that he finished with a Joshuaesque smile . Oh great , another liberal . Well , hopefully he 'd ask the same questions and I 'd give him the same answers . <p> " Hi , " he said . I nodded . " You 're uh . . . ? " <p> " Jack Manning , " I said , using my preferred abbreviation for my painfully ironic full name , Jackie Robinson Manning . <p> " Oh . I 'm Mr. Sawyer . I teach algebra and coach , " he continued through that slight smile . <p> " Oh , " I replied , feeling awkward . What was I supposed to say ? I hated algebra . <p> " Where 'd you transfer from ? " <p> " Davidson . " <p> " Davidson ? Really ? " <p> " Uh-huh . " Why would I lie about that ? <p> " Where do you live ? " <p> " In the city . " <p> " Where in the city ? " Oh , shit . <p> " Oat Hill , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You play ball ? " <p> " A little , " I answered innocently , and his smile became a grin . <p> I spent most of the day wowing my teachers . Ordinarily , I 'd have kept my mouth shut until I was more sure of my surroundings , but since I was just then entering in the middle of the school year , I figured I needed a fast start . I decided that I 'd instill into their minds the image of me as some superstudent , not just good , but great . Firstly , it would dispel any doubts as to my mental capacities . Merely being a good student would n't be enough . Whites regarded a studious black the way people regard a roller-skating elephant . The wonder is not that he does it well , but that he does it at all . I was really going to give them something to wonder about . Secondly , on a more simplistic level , it would cause my teachers always to associate my name with being an " A " student , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a tendency to do in the course of a semester . First impressions are lasting impressions . <p> Among my stops was Biology , where I was the lone freshman . Other ninth-graders were not allowed to take sophomore biology , but I was , the result of more of my mother 's string manipulations . After greeting the students from last semester and identifying me to them as a new transfer , the teacher began her lecture . I sat back and waited for an opening . It came in the midst of the discourse on evolution when one student answered by responding , " I think it 's the recapitation principle or something . " I jumped in , correcting him by saying that the word was " recapitulation . " Instantly , every head in the room swiveled towards me . Every face had a look of surprise , with two exceptions . The teacher 's had a look of shock and the boy 's I had corrected had a look of fury . The teacher acknowledged my answer as being correct and asked me if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . I said that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny . Then I defined ontogeny , then phylogeny . Then I translated the theory into layman 's terms . Then I gave a couple of examples . As I explained each step , I watched the teacher . Her brow progressively furrowed and her head continually nodded . When I finished , someone let out a low whistle and I knew that the class was mine for the taking . <p> My other classes went much the same way . I 'd wait for my chance , then stand everyone on their heads . I really shocked the shit out of the history instructor by offering an eloquent summary of a couple of amendments to the Constitution . He grinned and said that , even if I had been down South in the Fifties , they 'd have had to let me vote . I liked him immediately . <p> The only really awkward moment came as I sat in English class . The teacher had assigned Huckleberry Finn and the students were taking turns reading aloud from the text . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigger . Almost invariably , whoever was reading would get to the word , pause , look up at the teacher , look back down at the book , then say the word quickly and quietly . Immediately after saying it , the reader would experience a barely perceptible cringe and dare a quick glance at me . The rest of the class was divided between those taking similar glances and others who decided to keep their heads down . Way down . I gathered that they were expecting me to pull a switchblade and go berserk . I had this brief image of myself tearing open my vest to reveal a cape and dashiki emblazoned with the letter B , and then single-handedly tearing down the school . It would have been funny . I wish I could have done it . <p> I spent my breaks and study halls getting filled in about my classmates by my instant buddy , Joshua . He identified people as we passed them , greeting very few . Their surnames all sounded familiar . It was a while before I realized that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large local corporations and firms . A few shared their names with museums and galleries , one with a planetarium , one with a hospital . <p> Josh took pains to express his disdain for his classmates and the school in general . He felt that the vast majority of our fellow students were shallow , immoral , narrow-minded and undeserving , all of which was probably true , but did n't really bother me ; at least not as much as Josh professed it bothered him . Josh was pleasant and likable , despite his socio-political bent . I 'd always felt that if you scratched a liberal , you 'd find an arch-conservative . Liberalism seemed unnatural as it was often contrary to the laws of self-preservation , and this made it suspect . Thus I found it easier to deal with open prejudice ; fewer layers to work through . But Josh was all right , tolerable , only getting on my nerves when asking about some obscure **25;0;TOOLONG program and was I a part of it . I put the matter to rest by saying that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inquiring as to which one he was on . He gave me a puzzled look before saying that he was n't receiving any aid either . Only briefly daunted , Josh then asked what my father did for a living . I said that he was a pimp . Josh laughed , but only after thinking about it for too long . <p> Among the notables about whom Josh had informed me were Richard , Barbara , Vong , and Stuart . These four had , until my arrival , been the most distinguished members of my class . <p> Richard I had already met . He was the BMOC who had made tennis courts safe for decent folk . His grandfather had made a fortune mining magnetic metal and devising many of its myriad uses . He was literally a magnet magnate . Feeling philanthropic , he had given an endowment to Clarendon which had resulted in a new science building being named after him . Richard was an outstanding student and star athlete , earning spots on the varsity soccer , ski and tennis teams though only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and despised , often by the very same people . Josh claimed that Richard had once walked across the courtyard , in the midst of what later became a tornado , without mussing a single strand of hair . <p> Barbara was a bitch . She was cruel , arrogant , vicious , wealthy , and built ; an unbeatable combination . She was , consequently , the most sought-after girl in the school . She was the one girl you could ask to hurt you and be sure that she would . I 'd never have a chance with her . So , of course , I immediately wanted her and wanted her immediately . I decided not to press my luck . Showing off in class was one thing , hitting on white girls was another . Besides , truth be known , I was never much of a ladies ' man . At best , Barbara would be the source of a few wet dreams . She rolled her eyes the first time we passed in the hall . Barbara dated Richard . <p> Vong was a Vietnamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. during the previous semester . That was as much as anyone knew about him . <p> Stuart , too , was unique . I saw it the moment I laid eyes on him . He somehow did n't fit . Or maybe it was just his clothes that did n't fit . Both his coat and tie hung loosely and he did n't seem comfortable in them . His body seemed to move independently beneath his clothes , ignoring them as they got in his way . Everything about him was different . His stride was looser than that of the rest of the male students , though definitely masculine . And he did n't wear that blank suburban expression . Instead , his face had a hard , intent set to it . All of this looked familiar , but out of place . I could n't explain it , but I felt that I had seen Stuart before , but not there and not like that . It was more than mildly disturbing . Josh identified him only when I inquired . <p> " Oh , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his story ? " <p> " Beats me . He does n't talk too much . Kind of a loner . He 's from the city . " <p> " The city ? " <p> " Yeah . He won a scholarship out to here a couple of years ago . Some kind of a math whiz or something . " <p> " Oh , " I said . <p> " He does n't like me . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " I du n no . He just does n't . ' <p> Things had gone pretty well that first day . I had made my presence felt in a positive way . I had n't shown up late for a single class . I had contributed to every session . I had used flawless diction and , except for buttering my unbroken bread at lunch , flawless manners . ( Personally , I had never heard of such a rule of etiquette until the teacher at my table informed me of it . Not only did it seem silly and pointless , it made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I walked , nor toted a large portable radio on my shoulder . I hoped they appreciated that . I came away from that first day feeling as though I had shot down a good deal of the preconceived notions anyone had about me . I would spend the next few weeks gunning down the rest . <p> After school I headed down to the field house per Mr. Sawyer 's request . That morning in homeroom he had explained that the basketball team was in the middle of its season and was having difficulties due to both injuries and a general lack of skill . I said that the situation sounded unfortunate . He went on to explain that the school participated in a small league consisting of private schools and the smaller suburban public schools . I said that I thought that sounded like a good arrangement . He finished by saying that the team could always use fresh talent and that he would like for me , if possible , to come down to the field house after school to see about joining the team . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When Mr. Sawyer had asked me if I played ball , I 'd just assumed that he meant did I play at all . Yes , I had played in gym class , but to me a real player was one of those eight-foot behemoths from Davidson who would chase us out of the gym at each free period and then proceed to wreck the rims with slam dunks . Or else it was one of those smaller guys who could dribble between his legs , behind his back , and pass across the court in one motion  --  without looking . My own skills were severely limited , almost to the point of nonexistence . I could jump and I could shoot , but not at the same time . I had to use a set shot because my jumping would always make the ball go way off target . My lone additional talent was dribbling fast . I could race down the court dribbling the ball without having to watch it . I could do this only provided that no one got in the way , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I was cut off , I had to either stop or plow right into whoever was guarding me . Several times I had almost gotten into fights about it at Davidson , since players sometimes thought I did it intentionally . As for other abilities , I could dribble between my legs , but not behind my back , and only when I was standing alone , unguarded . For all practical intents and purposes , between-the-legs dribbling was out of the question . Moreover , with the exception of intramural homeroom soccer at Davidson , I had never played any organized sport in my life . <p> Suffice to say that I was a little apprehensive about trying out for the Davidson team . After all , I was just a freshman and my being five-eight did n't seem to be a point in my favor . Then I figured , What the heck . I was probably just intimidating myself with those memories of the Davidson players . The Clarendon players would n't be nearly as good . They 'd probably be pathetic . The average guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Granted , I was below average , but still . . . <p> When I got to the field house , I found Mr. Sawyer 's of office . He gave me a locker and the standard player equipment : a reversible practice shirt , shorts , socks , jock . He made a joke when searching the supply-room shelves for the jock . He said he hoped he had one big enough for " one of you guys . " He chuckled as he said it so that I 'd know he did n't mean it . However , he was surprised by my startled look and quickly assured me that the jocks were measured by waist size and that there 'd be no trouble finding me one . <p> Mr. Sawyer also said that I would , of course , need a pair of sneakers . When I told him that I did n't have any , he said for me just to bring them the following day . But I said no , I did n't have any . Oxfords , I had ; boots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never had much use for . The gym classes at Davidson had simply allowed you to go barefooted . Mr. Sawyer looked puzzled when I told him that I did n't own any sneakers . Then something seemed to dawn on him . He asked me what size I wore , told me not to worry , then disappeared into one of the supply-room closets . He emerged with a pair of very used sneakers . <p> " Here , " he said . " These are yours . You can keep these . " <p> " Uh , but  --  " I was hesitant , to say the least . The shoes were in less than perfect condition and wearing some unknown person 's preserved sneakers seemed extremely unsanitary . <p> " Do n't worry . You can keep them . You do n't have to pay for them . " <p> Well , a gift horse and all that . I took the sneakers . Mr. Sawyer then surprised me by handing me a game uniform . I had not expected to receive one unless I made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I to complain if the coach wanted to put me on the varsity basketball team on faith ? I had never expected to play a varsity sport , so this was one chance I was n't about to pass up . <p> I went to the locker room to change . Several of the players nodded at me and smiled . Some came over to introduce themselves . Everyone had already changed except me . After we finished exchanging greetings , I excused myself and started to undress . The other players all remained there in front of my locker , some coughing , others absently shuffling their feet . As I gradually disrobed , some of them made small talk with each other , commenting on the upcoming game , the condition of the court and whatnot . However , as I dropped my pants , all attention was back on me . Needless to say , no one was looking me in the eye . Fortunately , I had only removed my pants and had left my briefs in place . I grabbed my jock and gym shorts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Jeez , I have to take a leak . Is there a bathroom around here ? " <p> I was informed that there was such a facility around the corner to the left . I went there , entered a stall , and changed , disappointing my teammates for the first of what would be several times . ( The shorts fit okay , but the jock was a bit snug around the waist and a little baggy at the crotch . ) <p> When I entered the gym for warm-ups , I was more than a little surprised by the abilities of my new teammates . Compared to the Davidson players , they were slow and mechanical , but they were able to perform many of the same feats . They were dribbling behind their backs , between their legs , passing crisply and shooting well . I looked on nervously . I did not yet know about suburban summer basketball camps . <p> As I watched , Mr. Sawyer came up behind me , put his arm around my shoulders , and proceeded to confuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of motion : pass and go through , pass and go behind , pass and pick away . What are you used to ? " <p> What could I say ? I was used to three-bounces-and-shoot . I just said that it did n't matter to me . He seemed pleased by this . <p> " We also run a 4-1 zone and occasionally use a guard overload , " he continued . I nodded . " Defensively , we try to stay in a basic 3-2 or 2-1-2 zone . We stay in the zone because we do n't usually match up too well with the other schools , but I 'd like to use you in a box-and-one or a diamond-and-one . " I did n't know how to respond . My idea of defense had always consisted of waiting for the other team to miss . Mr. Sawyer went on . " The point guard is crucial to our system , even more so than usual . That 's what we need , a good point guard . " <p> " Well , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should be able to handle it . " The coach 's face went blank for a moment . <p> " A point guard does n't have to shoot that much , " he said . <p> " Oh . Oh , yeah , " I said , as if I had momentarily forgotten myself . Was n't a point guard supposed to score points ? <p> " Well , I 'll give you time to settle in , " said the coach . " Go to it , " he yelled , smacking me on the butt . The intention was to send me off , jocklike , into the workout . The result was that I , unused to such behavior , jumped about three feet into the air . I looked back at the coach . He smiled and said , " Whoa , you can really get up there ! " <p> I managed to make it through the first two practices with a minimum of difficulty , thanks mostly to the wonder of misinterpretation . The first drill consisted of three-on-two fast breaks . My group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " point " each time . It turned out that the point guard was expected to dribble the ball up the court , initiate the offense and generally run the show . The drill itself was for the dribbler to race downcourt with a teammate on each side , heading towards the far basket , which was guarded by two defenders . The defenders were arranged such that one was at the foul line and the other beneath the basket . The first defender would pick up the dribbler while the second would try to anticipate which of the dribbler 's wingmen was to receive the ball and block him from the hoop . It was perfect . <p> I stood beneath my own basket , waiting for the coach to say " go . " While waiting , I dribbled the ball between my legs in the safety of the time-out . When the coach gave the word , I was off and running . I charged straight down the court , elbows and knees flying , head held straight up . I crossed half-court like a comet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it was going . As I approached the top of the circle , the first defender took a step forward . I immediately panicked , screeching to a halt . Both of my wingmen were cutting to the basket . The second defender was beneath it , swaying from side to side . I did n't know which way he was going to go . As I hesitated , both of my teammates continued to the basket , actually passing each other beneath it . I was confused and terrified . You had only one moment to make the right move on a fast break and mine had already passed . I could feel all the eyes of the team on me . Then , with nothing else to do , I tried old reliable . I quickly set up and launched a twenty-two-foot set shot , releasing it a split second before the " up " man reached me . I 'm not sure how long it was up there , but it seemed like an hour . The other players headed to the basket , hoping for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my hand . As I watched the ball come down , I could see that it was going to be short of the mark . It was . It hit off the front of the rim and , to my horror , rebounded long  --  directly back to me . I did n't even have to move . I caught it chest-high and immediately threw it back up . What else was I going to do ? My passing skills had n't improved any since the last time I 'd held the damn thing . This time it fell through , cleanly . I nearly fainted . <p> I trotted off to the side , smiling . Mr. Sawyer approached me , grinning . <p> " That was great , " he said , " but next time think about passing off . Do n't try to do it all yourself . These guys can make layups . " My incompetence had been mistaken for bravado . What the coach thought was an unnecessary showcase of skill was actually a display of the only abilities I possessed , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drill , the " up " man came out on me very quickly  --  too quickly . He was trying to force me into committing myself early . What he did n't know was that I was committed from the moment I started dribbling . Unable to spin away and not having enough time to stop , I slammed right into him . We crashed to the floor , the ball bouncing away . As I lay sprawled on the floor blinking , I heard the coach blow the whistle . <p> " Outstanding ! Way to be aggressive in there ! Way to make them force the foul ! " Apparently , the defender was still moving when I ran into him . Because of this , my running into him constituted a blocking foul on his part . I had made what was considered a shrewd move . It was while lying there , listening to the coach sing my praises , that I realized the wisdom of the saying " All the skill in the world is no substitute for blind , dumb luck . " <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the defender . However , this time the defender had established position and I was guilty of a charging foul ( and probably felonious assault ) . The coach 's only reaction was to warn me that I , perhaps , should n't be too aggressive . <p> And that 's how it went . I 'd make a mistake and its cause would be misinterpreted . Or else my limited skills would make themselves useful at precisely the right moment . Bad passes were blamed on my lack of familiarity with the offense or else the coach assumed that I was leading my tosses too much , anticipating quicker teammates than those with whom I was being forced to play . I beat a full-court press by simply plotting a straight line through it and dribbling right down the line as quickly as I could , all the while praying that no one would step into my path . A couple of times I was able to shoot my way out of tough spots after having stopped my dribble too soon . One jump shot even became a lob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what an assist was until my second practice . <p> Despite my luck , I still had not distinguished myself as a player . As a matter of fact , I was not quite as good as the others . I missed offensive opportunities . I had to think about , and therefore hesitate before performing , fundamental maneuvers , and I often lost my assigned man on defense . The coach did n't seem to notice , or else believed that it would all come in time . I myself knew that in time my luck was going to run out and I was going to be helpless . I just hoped for a miracle . <p> After the second practice , James , a teammate , and I were throwing the ball around . James was a nice guy and a good team player . His individual skills were only slightly better than mine , but he knew the game and worked hard , always performing solidly , if not spectacularly . Moreover , he loved the game and was a real rah-rah type guy who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me learn how to change directions on my dribble . As we were getting ready to go back to the locker room , Mr. Sawyer stuck his head into the gym and called James into his office . <p> Mr. Sawyer cut James from the team . He felt that with me on the roster someone had to go . When I saw James afterward , he was heartbroken . I almost volunteered to quit right then and there . Almost . I knew that the coach figured that someone from Oat Hill just had to be a good basketball player . And I also knew that I was n't . But hell , I was n't going to be noble to the point of throwing away this chance . I had lucked into a spot on the varsity team . I was a jock . It was more than I could 've hoped for , and I was n't about to sacrifice it for anyone . Hey , I told myself , whites had given black people too few breaks for me to afford to walk away from one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , after two days of classes and practices , I spent the weekend recuperating . I did n't roll out of bed until noon on either Saturday or Sunday and spent the afternoons cracking my knuckles , scratching my head , and doing other important stuff like that . My parents asked me if I had any homework . I told them that classes were just getting back into the swing of things . That was true , but I did have homework . I just did n't feel like doing it . I was to read two chapters of American history , do three math exercises , and have a novel read by Tuesday  --  Native Son by Richard Wright . <p> I read the history on the way to school Monday . The math I did in study hall , before class . As I was coming out of Geometry , I was privileged to witness Barbara and Richard staging a scene to the amusement of several other students . Having arrived late , I was not able to piece together the particulars of the argument , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara , in her final fit of rage , shrieked to Richard that he was a " dickless little wimp . " I had seen people killed for less . At this point the crowd , which now included the rest of the geometry class , broke into a collective smirk . Someone actually giggled out loud . As I stood waiting for Richard to kill Barbara , she turned away from him and caught me staring at her . She looked at me for a moment , smiled slightly , looked back at Richard ( who just stood there red-faced and furious ) , then back at me . She walked over and then in front of Richard , the crowd and God , right there in the venerable halls of the Clarendon School for Young Men and Women  --  Barbara Colette Waterford asked me to the " Winter Wahoo " dance . <p> I was n't crazy . I knew exactly what she was doing and so did everyone else . And I knew who Richard was and the state of mind he was in . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bled . There was no way I would agree to go out with that girl . <p> As I thought of a tactful way to decline , Barbara took another step forward . The points of her breasts were pressing against my chest . Her face tilted upwards towards mine . Then she slowly licked her lips and , with the throatiest voice I 've ever heard before or since , said , " Please ? " <p> I myself was still resolved to refuse her . Unfortunately , my phallus was in the habit of practicing ventriloquism , using me as its dummy . The word sure came out of my mouth as if I had said it . Barbara smiled . As I looked past her , I saw that Richard still had an expression of rage , only now his gaze was focused on me rather than Barbara . Barbara stepped away from me and turned down the hall , past Richard . Just before disappearing , she looked over her shoulder and fired a parting shot at him , ricocheting it off me . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real man for a change . " <p> That 's when I knew I was dead . Richard 's glassy eyes were locked on me . I thought I saw steam coming out of his ears . Really . The crowd was n't moving . Everyone was looking back and forth between Richard and myself . The blood started pulsing in my ears the way it does whenever I 'm scared . I checked the exits . The crowd had filled in the path Barbara had followed down the hall and other students were inadvertently blocking the one door in the other direction . I was going to have to run over someone to escape . As my eyes searched for the weakest point in the crowd , Richard took a step forward . I turned and looked him in the face , petrified . He took another step . Suddenly , he stopped and his expression seemed to break . He looked me up and down , then grimaced . He then turned away and quickly pushed his way through the crowd . I just stood there , still scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chattering at once . Two of my classmates approached me , offering opinions . <p> " I thought you were going to have to whip his ass , " one said . <p> " Me too , " I replied sarcastically . I then looked at him and realized he was serious . <p> " You 'd have killed him , " added the other . <p> " Hey , " I said , " I thought Richard was supposed to be pretty tough . " <p> " He is , " the second one assured me , " but you 'd have killed him . " <p> I decided to play it for all it was worth . <p> " Yeah , he 's lucky he stopped when he did . I 'd have messed that motherfucker up , " I said , layering my voice with a heavy Oat Hill accent I saved for such occasions . <p> In a matter of three days , I had entered the most exclusive school in the region , established myself atop the class academically , made the varsity basketball team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hottest girl around . On the whole , I 'd have had to say things were going fairly well . <p> That afternoon we had a league basketball game . Mr. Sawyer told me beforehand that he did n't want to play me so soon , what with a new system to learn and all . He kept me beside him on the bench , pointing out to me our team 's mistakes and telling me how I should correct them when I became a regular . I had never before seen a high-school basketball game . It was all very interesting ; nothing like I 'd imagined . <p> We lost the game by twenty-three and I never left the bench . The coach had not wanted to " waste me " in a " hopeless cause . " <p> That night after dinner , I discovered that Richard Wright was black and that the novel he 'd written was about blacks in America . I knew I was in trouble . All attention was bound to be focused on me in the next day 's class and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the text . <p> I read as much of Native Son as I could Monday night and more on Tuesday morning as my father drove me to school . Twenty minutes before class was to begin I still had not made a significant dent in the book . I hurriedly searched the library for Josh on the off chance that he , though not in the class , had read the book on his own and could summarize it for me . I found him sitting at a table in the rear , thumbing through a copy of Soul on Ice . I did n't even know there were black skaters . <p> Luckily , Joshua had read Native Son . I took out my notebook and scribbled information as Josh explained the book to me . I wrote what he said , not listening to him nor looking at what I was writing . <p> After the class was seated , the teacher came in and sat down . She was middle-aged and pleasant and was one of the few instructors whom Josh had praised to me . She kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and smiling when she got to my name . I had impressed her the previous Friday with an explanation of the function of chapter sixteen in Huckleberry Finn . She was obviously expecting big things from me for the discussion of Wright 's work . Once the plot had been adequately summarized , the teacher handed me center stage by asking , " Jack , did Bigger really intend to kill her ? " <p> It was a simple question  --  unless , of course , you had n't read the book . I hesitated a moment before answering . I knew that the question was too simple to justify me checking my notes . Then I realized that I had a fifty-fifty chance of being right , either way . I said yes . The teacher 's raised eyebrows instantly told me that I had guessed wrong . She was very surprised . <p> She politely reproved my answer , saying it was n't " quite correct . " I blushed , unbeknownst to anyone else . My classmates were smirking . I did n't see them , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right answer , a sickening feeling of irredeemable humiliation sank into me . I felt the shame well up inside me and begin to rise . Finally , it was more than I could bear , so I attacked . <p> " How do you know ? " I said this with as keen an edge of contempt as I could muster . <p> " Pardon ? " She was startled . <p> " How do you know ? " I continued . " How do you know what the author meant ? " <p> " Well , " she stammered , " I 've always thought . . . and there are scholarly papers that say  --  " <p> " How can you propose to tell me what Richard Wright meant ? How do you propose to understand Wright ? What do you even know about him ? " <p> " Well , you see , there are scholarly papers which  --  " <p> " Written by whom ? " I questioned , my implication crystal clear to her . <p> " Uh , I 've just always known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " You ca n't know how he felt . You ca n't pretend to understand what was in the man 's heart . Do n't tell me how he felt . " <p> " Well , all right . . . " <p> " Bigger meant to kill her , " I shouted . " He planned it ! That 's the way he wanted it ! " <p> " Well , okay , " said the teacher . " I suppose maybe you 're right . " <p> " Maybe ? " I scoffed . <p> " Yes . You 're right . I 'm sorry . " She then went on to explain to the class that they should n't kid themselves ; that white people could never have more than a surface understanding of minorities and that she herself and scholars in general had been far too presumptuous . For the rest of the week , the class approached Native Son from the standpoint of Bigger intentionally killing the white girl . The result was that Richard Wright was butchered , but Jack Manning was spared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Things were leaning my way , but precariously so . That afternoon in practice we worked on free-throw shooting to the near exclusion of all else . We would be playing a team that was known to foul deliberately a lot . They had , according to Mr. Sawyer , no foot speed and thus committed fouls to send opponents to the line rather than taking the chance of getting burned on fast breaks . <p> Because of my trusty set shot , I was able to breeze through the foul-shot drills . I missed two of my first four , but did n't miss again all afternoon . The coach seemed more surprised than pleased . <p> " You can really hit those free throws , huh ? " <p> " Uh , yeah , Coach . I can hit them pretty well , " I said . <p> " Where 'd you learn to do that ? " <p> " Uh , around , " I mumbled . Where did anyone learn to shoot free throws ? " Just learned it in the streets , " I continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets ? " The coach 's eyebrows raised . " I 've never seen a street pickup game with foul shots . " He was one up on me ; I 'd never seen a street pickup game . <p> " Man , where you been ? " I asked through a nervous giggle . <p> " Oh , twenty-one . You guys must 've played a lot of twenty-one . " <p> " Yeah , " I said . " I guess that 's what did it . " He nodded and walked away . The game was on Thursday . I knew I would have to do a better job of staying on my toes , both physically and mentally , if I wanted to last that long . <p> Actually , I was not giving the game much thought . I was looking past it to Friday , which happened to be the day of the dance . Barbara had not really spoken to me since she 'd asked me to escort her . However , she always made a point of coming near me and making small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few times she rubbed my back , and she even addressed me as " stud " once or twice . I had decided to try to live up to her expectations , or at least to mine . The fact of the matter was that had natives suddenly appeared , intent on sacrificing a virgin , I 'd have had to run for my life . <p> I spent the evening thinking mostly about the date . Should I try to be proper and shy ? Impress her with my sensitivity ? Would she be coy ? Demure ? Then I got a grip on myself . This was Barbara , for god 's sake ! I 'd be lucky to make it back alive . The question was not would we do it , but would I be adequate and would " adequate " be enough . <p> Thoughts of " the act " crept into my mind . Was it really like in the movies ? Nothing else had ever been . How long did it take ? Was it really that tiring ? Could you keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch . And taste and smell and hear . I wanted to experience it in its fullness , to be sure and understand every aspect and comprehend every nuance . I was just like everyone else . <p> I decided that Wednesday was going to be a breeze . All things being relative , anything that happened on Wednesday would have to be insignificant compared to the back-to-back watershed events of the basketball game and my first real date . Anyway , it had to be an easy day . The music teacher had convinced the headmaster of the importance of the freshman class ' being exposed to " culture . " To that end , we were scheduled to take a field trip that afternoon to hear the local philharmonic give a specially arranged concert . We were to be excused from our last-period classes as well as sports practice . <p> As field trips were to be supervised by homeroom teachers , and as Mr. Sawyer was one of the two teachers assigned to freshman homeroom , he felt obliged to cancel practice altogether . <p> Barbara and thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left me slightly behind in my studies . However , I discovered during my first week that I could avoid being asked any more unwelcome questions if I held my face a certain way , gave it a certain set . This invariably warded off any inquiries about late homework assignments . I used it to great effect . <p> At two o'clock I and the rest of the ninth-graders gathered our book bags , pulled on our coats , and headed down the path to the parking lot . A bus had been reserved to whisk us to this wonderful concert none of us cared about . As I stood by the bus watching my classmates get on board , I realized that I had never been on a bus with any of these people . My father always dropped me off in the mornings and picked me up after practice . Then I realized I had never been anywhere with these people , outside the classroom or gymnasium setting . <p> Mr. Sawyer was standing by the bus door speaking to the driver and absently herding in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . I decided to wander over to him and put in a good word for myself . <p> " I 'm all set for tomorrow , Coach . " He gave me a wan smile and a listless nod of his head . I nodded mine and decided that maybe I 'd better wander back to where I 'd been . Coach Sawyer did n't seem particularly confident , but I could n't tell whether it was about me or the game . I thought it prudent not to force the issue . I turned and mounted the steps of the bus . <p> As I stood at the front of the aisle I saw two empty seats . One was in the very front in the row opposite the driver 's side . The other was way in the back in the row behind the driver . The forward-facing of the seats put me right at center stage . My fellow students were all looking at me from green padded benches . I saw Josh sitting about halfway back , next to that little guy named Vong . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . <p> I looked down at the empty seat in the front , beside which I stood . I decided to sit in the back . The bus was a rear-engine job and it would be warmer back there . As I started forward , the other students seemed to begin looking away or at one another . I immediately shrugged it off as paranoia . I had come to the conclusion that there was no explanation for most of the things those kids did . As I neared the middle of the bus , Josh 's face recaptured my eye . His forehead wrinkled and his head was cocked and he seemed to be looking right through me . <p> Then it dawned on me . The proverbial back of the bus ! I had forgotten myself . I had to turn and take my rightful place as the fiercely free and fiercely fierce black man at the front of the vehicle . <p> As I pivoted in the aisle I saw Stuart , having gotten on last , settling into the empty space in front . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had started down the aisle , turned back up , and now stopped . To turn back again would look stupid . I would look stupid . And I 'd wind up in the back of the goddamned bus . I continued forward . <p> I came up to that front seat and squared myself to its side . I paused a moment , waiting for Stuart to look up . When he did , I put my race to work for me . <p> " Let me have that seat , man , " I said with a slight jerk of my head , indicating that Stuart should find a seat in back . <p> " What ? " His voice indicated mild irritation . It was also layered with a familiar accent that I somehow could n't place . I 'd never heard him speak before . <p> " Let me have that seat . Grab another one . " <p> Stuart scowled . " You grab another one . " It was not the response I had anticipated . I knew we were being watched . I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head while holding what I hoped to be an amused grimace on my face . <p> " C'm on , man , " I said . " I want this one . Clear out . " I felt the weight of my peers ' judgment pushing me from the back , forcing me forward . The bus had suddenly quieted down , and once more I could hear the pulsing of that red sea of confusion in my ears . <p> Stuart did n't say anything for a while . When I realized he was one-upping me by ignoring my command , I repeated myself . <p> " C'm on , man . Move it . " Stuart looked up at me , then looked straight ahead , and stood up . I was relieved to have won the challenge . The seat would be mine and everything would still be going my way . Stuart turned and faced me , looked me in the eye , and said , " Fuck you . " <p> He said it loudly and distinctly . Everyone must 've heard it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood stunned as Stuart glared at me . It was then , in that split second , that I finally recognized him  --  the Cracker . . . poor white trash . . . working-class white nigger disguised by a coat and tie . Oh , yeah , I knew him : the white who had grown up with blacks , perhaps as a black or , at least , no better . And his familiarity had bred contempt . He had that visceral understanding that hardness is a function of hardship , not race , because he and his had lived the hardship . He was terrifically dangerous . He was not afraid . He knew better . So did I. I was terrified . <p> Suddenly , savagely , Stuart shoved me , giving me twin stiff-arms to the chest and sending me sprawling across the aisle into the next seat . I crashed into two girls who squealed in horror and excitement . I struggled to my feet in an agony of humiliation . I was standing square to Stuart once again . No one on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rapt attention . I stood transfixed , staring at Stuart , too shocked and ashamed to move . I saw that his fists were clenched . I realized that for the first time in my life I was in a fight . I suddenly gained the presence of mind to close my open hands , but , as I did so , Stuart lunged at my mouth with his right fist . His solid , knobby hand landed flush against my face , snapping shut my slack jaw . <p> The next thing I knew , I was back across the aisle , once again sprawled out on the squealing girls . I looked up to see a blurry vision of Stuart standing over me . There was somebody standing beside him . After a moment , I realized it was Mr. Sawyer . I was saved again , thank God . He stood there a second with a look of bewilderment . In the next instant , Stuart was grabbing me by my lapels and hauling me to my feet . Once I was standing , he held my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head with the other . I was too mortified to defend myself . I heard a low buzzing , but was n't sure if it was the other students or a result of the blows . I waited for Mr. Sawyer to do something . He just stood there like he was waiting for me to do something . Finally , I did . I cried . I bawled my ass off , right there in front of the whole goddamned class . <p> When Stuart finally let me go , I collapsed in a heap to the fluted rubber floor . After a few more sobs , I pulled myself up by the steel railing behind the driver 's seat and stumbled off the bus . Then I dragged myself back up the path to the school and waited there for my father to pick me up . <p> It appears that I did n't have anything to worry about for Thursday and Friday after all . I did n't get in the game on Thursday and afterward the coach suggested that I might do better to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even the sneakers . As for Barbara , she called me up to tell me how sorry she was for me and how unfortunate the whole thing had been and how she felt bad about having to cancel our date since she was coming down with a cold and that maybe she had n't really been fair to Richard . In class I no longer received the deference of students nor teachers . And Josh began spending a great deal of time with his new best buddy , Vong . <p> It seemed that no one knew quite what to make of me after that . I did n't know either , but I decided that I 'd best start from scratch . <p> <p> By Daniel Tyree McElrath <p>
