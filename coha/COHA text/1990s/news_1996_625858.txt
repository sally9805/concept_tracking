<p> Gramm abandoned us <p> There is justice in this world . <p> Sen. Phil Gramm , R-Texas is out of the GOP presidential race . <p> Obsessed with being president , he abandoned his constituents four years ago to raise the necessary money . Too busy campaigning , he ignored the issues vital to Texas in favor of anything popular in the national polls . Now he has found that his best friend " " ready cash " may be his only friend after trying - unsuccessfully - to spend himself into the White House . <p> Besides his million-dollar war chest , Gramm became famous for trampling others to grab the headlines . He also set new records for saying anything for a vote . He bowed and scraped to the Christian Coalition only to find out that they do n't trust him either . <p> Now that he has lost , let 's not let him turn tail and run back to Texas . Instead , we must remember what Gramm hopes we will forget : that he has not been doing the job we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fall when we boot him out of the Senate . <p> Instead of having someone whose only interest is his own selfish ambition , let 's elect someone who actually cares about us for a change . <p> Susan H. Gates , Kingwood <p> Reasons for right 's passion <p> Regarding Otis Pike 's Feb.14 Outlook article , " " Religious zeal , politics a volatile combination " : <p> Pike tries to trash the " " religious right " or Christian conservatives by ostensibly connecting them to fanatical groups and causes . <p> Essentially he says the Christian conservative is unfairly influencing the political dialogue by skillfully using the tools of democracy and , gasp , getting voters to the polls . His belief is that they " " exert a power out of all proportion to their numbers . " <p> It 's not the Christian or " " religious right " that are driving a wedge between us , but the concepts and fringe groups that make up liberal thinking and the current Democratic Party . <p> The debate today is stark - it is between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arena of ideas , the liberal is at a disadvantage because his ideas have n't worked and/or will not appeal to the average citizen trying to make a living and raise a family . <p> Therefore , they must create scapegoats or " " bogeymen " to weaken their opponents ' argument . That 's what Pike did here , and why I find his article extremely offensive . <p> Doug Malloy , Houston <p> Reasons for right 's passion <p> In all of the examples Otis Pike cites in his Outlook article , ( Bosnia , Chechnya , the Irish Republican Army , Muslim extremism , etc. ) , the fundamental premise is that people are killing each other over religious and ethnic differences . <p> Yet the basic purpose of the Christian conservatives is not to take a life , but to preserve it . <p> I know of no one today who does not believe that something is terribly wrong in our culture . While we slept , a secular humanist philosophy was allowed to permeate our society , aided and abetted by " " judicial legislation " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coalition and other like-minded groups are merely trying unscramble the eggs that got us to this poisonous omelette . <p> To say that one can have a moral and ethical society without a religious foundation is engaging in sophistry ; for unless you do , you are unable to answer the question : " " Who says so ? " <p> What has been particularly frightening is that a substantial part of our electorate is willing to vote for politicians who have demonstrated a lifestyle of cheating in their personal affairs and lying in their public affairs . Who believes that John F.Kennedy would have been elected 35 years ago had we known of his personal lifestyle ? Yet , it no longer seems to matter . <p> You do n't have to be a rocket scientist to see that what we are doing is n't working . <p> This is the reason for the passions of the so-called " " religious right . " <p> J. Walter Carpenter , Houston <p> Must follow U.S. laws <p> Whether Clara A. Boggs likes it or not , she 's wrong and Planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Social norms acceptable in some cultures are often not acceptable in any other culture - including cannibalism , incest , head hunting , child abuse - and it 's pure arrogance to look at it any other way . <p> Any man , regardless of his origins , who takes advantage of a 14-year-old girl is guilty of at least child abuse , if not statutory rape , and should be punished . This is against the laws of Texas . These laws apply to U.S. citizens , legal immigrants and illegal aliens . What may be normal cultural practice in Mexico does n't invalidate the laws of Texas , and his ignorance of the law is no excuse for Pedro Sotelo . <p> Milton E.Milstead , Houston <p> It is a lack of parenting <p> The problem is not the schools . <p> The problem is the students . <p> The students ' problem is a lack of parenting . <p> Ron Balsam , Shoreacres <p> Shots drown out NRA <p> Regarding the Feb. 12 headline , " " 16 hurt in rival gangs gun battle " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rifle Association : " " Guns do n't kill people , people do . " Louder ! I ca n't hear you , you 're being drowned out by the sound of gunfire . <p> H. F. Cook , Houston <p> For P.R . purposes . . . <p> Congress passed a military appropriations bill which provides for the discharge of service members who are HIV-positive . The president , toting water on both shoulders , says that in order to avert grave harm to our national defense , he is forced to sign it into law , but because the HIV exclusion is - at least for public-relations purposes - discriminatory and unconstitutional . <p> As provided by the Constitution , Congress has the power " " to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces . " <p> There is , however , no constitutional right to serve in the armed forces . The too fat , the too tall , the too short , the mentally challenged , etc. , are not accepted for service . And persons who have acquired various disabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forthwith . After all , the fighting man 's business calls for considerable physical effort . <p> So why is a service person incurably infected with a contagious disease immune from the same treatment ? And absent a line-item veto , who is Commando Clinton to decide which portion of a law he will enforce and which he will not ? <p> A.T . McKinney , Houston <p> Kudos to Mr. Jamail <p> Regarding the Feb. 13 story about soon-to-be retired grocer Clarence Jamail : <p> What a great story about a business owner who suspended a big money-making deal until his employees would be assured of jobs at another grocery store , of being appreciative of customers and giving them the credit for supporting his business throughout the years , and of trying to make sure his elderly customers continue to have their groceries delivered . <p> Donna McElligott , Houston <p> Let us vote Republican <p> If the 104th Congress is the worst in 50 years , as Kevin Phillips writes in his Feb. 7 Outlook article , it is because a number of liberal Congress members have stooped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican budge proposals . <p> The media 's bias has given President Clinton a weapon against the Republicans . He knows that he can say anything , veto any bill , accept no responsibility - all with the blessing and help of the press . In the meantime , the country keeps going more and more into debt . <p> The policies of the past 50 years of Democratic Congress rule have gotten us into this dangerous debt situation . Let us vote in enough Republicans to get our country on the road to recovery . <p> Helen McAuliffe , Houston
