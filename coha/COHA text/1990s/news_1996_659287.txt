<p> Remember when car dealers put floor-to-ceiling sheets of brown paper over their showroom windows to prevent early peeks at the new models ? <p> Remember when every other television ad in the fall was for this all-new car or that brand-new model , not a channel-by-channel " roadblock " of hype for just one car like the redesigned Ford Taurus last fall ? <p> When it comes to new car introductions , fall is n't all anymore . <p> And the United States is n't always the place they 're shown first . Chrysler showed its American classic Jeep Wrangler for the first time in Tokyo last fall . Two years ago , the first look at the Dodge and Plymouth Neon was at the Frankfurt Auto Show . <p> The industry still tracks its sales from October to September because most models that are n't changing much from year to year still come out in late September and early October . <p> Detroit 's Big Three plan their production around a two-week " vacation " shutdown in July . When most of the workers leave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model . The few who stay get ready for building next year 's models . <p> Significantly redesigned or all new cars and trucks are different . They are introduced when the auto company thinks the time is right ; that is when it can be sure the model will get lots of attention . <p> The model year designation promises to become even less significant . <p> General Motors , the world 's largest automaker , is creating what it calls a manufacturing cadence for new models . Instead of stretching its engineers and designers to have a raft of new models ready at one time and risk one model overshadowing another , it is releasing them at roughly one every three months until the end of the decade . <p> Ford and Chrysler are doing the same thing at slightly different intervals . <p> Two of Ford 's most important 1997 models have been on sale for months . The redesigned F150 pickup truck was introduced way back in January . The F250 , a beefier version of the best-selling vehicle in the country for 19 consecutive years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer compact sedans and station wagons were revealed . An Escort coupe is due early next year as a 1997 model . Those who bought an Escort early will be driving a current model for close to two years . Another new Escort is due in 2000 . <p> Among the last of the 1997s will be Cadillac 's new Catera luxury sedan . Cadillac 's first attempt at an entry-level luxury car is a version of the Opel Omega , sold by GM 's German subsidiary . <p> Cadillac will sell Cateras regionally , first on the West Coast , then the East Coast , and finally nationwide . It is n't sure how fast it can get the cars from Germany to dealers , so it is taking a deliberate approach with advertising . <p> One of the first 1998 models will arrive next February when Ford reveals its redesigned Windstar minivan . Technically , any car that goes on sale on Jan. 1 or later of a given year can be considered next year 's model . <p> Here 's a look at what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Future stock listings tell what 's known about future models : <p> Acura <p> The renaming of Honda 's luxury line continues with the 3.0 CL coupe this fall . It is Honda 's first use of its U.S.-built V-6 engine . The 3.0 CL joins its less powerful and less expensive 2.2 CL sibling . <p> Aston Martin <p> There has n't been an Aston Martin sold in the United States in a long time . That changes next year when 250 copies of the DB7 go on sale . Base price is $ 135,000 plus gas guzzler and luxury taxes . All that money buys plenty of power : 335 horsepower and 361 pound-feet of torque from the 24-valve dual overhead cam in-line six-cylinder engine . <p> Audi <p> The A-8 full-size premium luxury sedan , a standout on the auto show circuit two years ago , arrives this fall in two versions - a 3.7-liter aluminum V8 that creates 230 horsepower and a 4.2-liter V8 Quattro that kicks out 300 horsepower . Safety gets serious play with four side airbags and seat-belt tensioners for front and rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heated steering wheel . <p> A 1.8-liter T model is added to the A4 lineup , featuring a four-cylinder , five-valve turbo engine and a few less goodies . <p> BMW <p> A front-end facelift this fall will make the 3-series look more like the rest of BMW 's lineup . <p> Future Stock : A longer and wider 3-series with a lot more interior room and styling borrowed from the larger 5-series is due in the United States in 1998 . <p> Buick <p> After 15 years and 2 million buyers , Buick is redesigning the Century for 1997 . Available late this year , the new Century will be bigger inside and out , enough for six passengers to ride in comfort . The wheelbase is 4.1 inches longer and the car is 3.6 inches wider . There is 5.9 more cubic feet of interior space and nearly a cubic foot more trunk room . Amenities galore : radio controls on the steering wheel , the choice of five radios , a trunk-mounted 12-compact disc changer , and a center console storage armrest coin holder big enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate control allows driver and front passenger to select individual temperatures . <p> Future Stock : A new Regal built on the same larger chassis as the Century will be available in early 1997 . <p> Cadillac <p> Cadillac finally gets its entry in the so-called entry-level luxury segment . The imported Catera arrives in small quantities this year in California , Oregon and Washington , then debuts in the Washington , D.C.-to-Boston area early in 1997 . There should be enough cars shipped in from GM 's Adam Opel subsidiary in Germany to be available in urban Cadillac dealerships nationwide by early next year . Catera is basically an Opel Omega remade to be a Cadillac . Catera is a substantial , roomy car - some critics say too heavy - powered by a 200-horsepower V6 and a four-speed automatic transmission with sport , normal and winter driving modes . Traction control and antilock brakes are standard . A dual-zone climate control lets driver and passenger ride in different temperatures . Prices start at $ 29,995 but destination and delivery charges push the price above $ 30,000 . Options like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices closer to $ 33,000 . <p> The 1997 DeVille becomes one of the first U.S. cars to feature standard side air bags . <p> Chevrolet <p> A name from the past , a new minivan and the fifth-generation Corvette sports car provide the highlights for 1997 . <p> Malibu , a name last used in 1983 , returns to the lineup at GM 's largest division as a contemporary midsize sedan replacing the Corsica . It has received early high marks for total package in the most competitive segment of the market . Prices are expected to be in the $ 15,000-$ 17,000 range . The sedan features a standard 2.4-liter engine that gets a respectable 150 horsepower . The LS model has a standard 3100 V6 that puts out 155 horsepower . Four-wheel antilock brakes are standard as is an automatic headlamp control that means no forgetting to turn your lights off . The interior features standard theater lighting ( it lowers automatically ) , rear-seat heat ducts , tinted glass and air conditioning . <p> Most appearance details of the fifth-generation Corvette are still under wraps . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III V8 , a powerful new version of the 5.7-liter power plant , is the latest in a long line of GM small-block engines that date to 1955 . Discussion within Chevrolet about going to an overhead cam design from the old pushrod technology was intense . In the end , surgery on the pushrod was a success . The new LS1 will feature 340 horsepower and 350 pound-feet of torque . <p> After six years of being lightly regarded in the minivan business , Chevrolet starts over with the Venture . It catches up to the competition ( Chrysler ) in the door department by offering an optional driver 's side sliding door , one that opens wide enough to make access to rear coat hooks convenient . It does Chrysler one better by carrying over the optional power feature on the passenger-side sliding door , which can be opened via keyless entry or by switches on the overhead console and on the pillar behind the front passenger seat . There are 26 storage areas and 17 cupholders , some that accommodate juice boxes . An optional dual-mode sound system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different stereo functions at the same time . Venture comes in either regular or extended wheelbase models . An extended wheelbase cargo model also is available . <p> C-K pickups and the Tahoe sport-utility vehicle get a passenger-side air bag , a year ahead of the original plan . <p> Camaro turns 30 in 1997 , and the Z28 model will get the birthday treatment in a special edition featuring arctic white exterior , including white door handles and black emblems . Centered stripes and hood extractors in " Hugger Orange " and five-spoke white aluminum wheels finish off the look . Inside , there is 30th anniversary embroidery on the front floor mats and standard houndstooth cloth seats with leather inserts and five-color 30th anniversary embroidery on the headrests . All other Camaros get a heat-stamped 30th anniversary emblem on the headrests . <p> The Lumina LTZ joins the Lumina lineup . This is the replacement for the Euro edition of the previous generation Lumina . An optional 3.4-liter dual overhead cam V6 kicks out 215 horsepower . <p> The Rally Sport Coupe joins the Cavalier lineup . <p> Chrysler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new front and rear fascias and a new spoiler on the LX model . The Town and Country minivan will have optional all-wheel drive , which comes with standard four-wheel disc brakes . <p> Dodge <p> The new Dakota pickup already is being called the Baby Ram . The distinctive drop fender look of the full-size Ram becomes a family look with its inclusion on Dodge 's other pickup . The new Dakota is stiffer to improve handling , and electrocoating of the frame should improve corrosion resistance . Paint chipping should be less frequent because of a full-body anti-chip primer . The only V8 in the compact/midsize pickup class gets 10 more horsepower and 10 additional pound-feet of torque . A tip-slide seat on the passenger side makes entry to the Club Cab easier , though not as easy as a third door would have . <p> Eagle <p> Talon sporty coupe gets a base model to join the ESi , TSi and TSi AWD offerings . <p> Ford <p> Ford has the biggest intro in its history this fall - at least the biggest vehicle in its history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford , borrows much of its design and suspension from the F150 and some components from the F250 . It falls between the size of the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban but is pitched as offering the best of both . Loads of cargo space with seating for six or seating for nine with an optional third row of seats . With the third row , however , you give up a lot of the cargo space . Ford 's other claim about Expedition is that it can fit , albeit snugly , in the average garage . Suburban ca n't do that . <p> The F250 , a beefier version of the F150 , offers Ford 's new 5.4-liter single overhead cam V-8 , with towing muscle up to 8,700 pounds . <p> To get really serious oomph , the Econoline cargo and Club Wagon passenger vans are the first to offer the 6.8-liter single overhead cam V-10 . Only about 15 percent of folks are ordering the monster engine in these . Ford can expect more interest when it offers the V-10 in its next group of one-ton and greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1998 . <p> Compared with the 7.5-liter V-8 it replaces , the V-10 puts out 20 more horsepower ( 265 vs. 245 ) and 13 more feet-pounds of torque ( 410 vs. 397 ) . Fuel economy is actually better at 11.7 miles per gallon vs. 10.3 in city/suburban driving as well as on the highway at 60 miles per hour , 16.1 mpg vs. 15.1 mpg . The new engine also accelerates faster . On the downside , it weighs 11 percent more and is 10 percent noisier . <p> A big change in the Windstar minivan comes next year with the so-called " king door " plan to counter the segment 's trend toward offering sliding doors on both sides of the vehicle . This fall , however , Ford is offering an optional tip-slide driver 's seat to make access to the rear seats easier . The tip-slide seat will be combined with the wider driver 's door for 1998 models , due in February . <p> Optional this fall in the Explorer sport-utility , Ranger compact pickup , and Aerostar minivan is a new single overhead cam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boasts Mercon V transmission fluid that normally does not have to be changed . <p> On the car side , Probe gets an optional Sport Appearance Package - a pair of wide racing stripes that run up the hood , over the roof and down to the rear bumper . Contour also gets a Sport package . Thunderbird gets an easier-to-read instrument panel and an optional power-sliding moonroof . <p> Future Stock : A mini sport-utility based on the Contour chassis in 1999 as a 2000 model ; A replacement for the Probe , also based on Contour underpinnings , a four-door Ranger for 1998 . <p> General Motors <p> The first car in the company 's history to carry a GM badge instead of one of its divisions is the first mass-production car powered by electricity since the early part of the century . It will be leased later this fall through 25 Saturn stores in Southern California and Arizona . <p> The EV1 is a two-door coupe , the fifth generation of the electric car called Impact that GM showed at the 1990 Los Angeles Auto Show . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batteries , the EV1 is virtually silent . No gear shifting . No gasoline fillups and no tailpipe emissions because there 's no tailpipe . <p> The EV1 can travel just 70 miles or so before it needs recharging . Future models , perhaps as soon as next year , will use a nickel-metal hydride battery pack capable of going at least twice as far . <p> The lease price - based on the mid-$ 30,000s before federal and state energy tax credits and rebates - comes with a home-based charger that will re-juice the car overnight , making it fine for normal work commutes but decidedly unfit for the family vacation . And two seats in the EV1 means two seats . Trunk space is ample but there 's nowhere else to put a lot of stuff . <p> Honda <p> The CR-V , Honda 's entry in the hot mini-sport-utility department , arrives late this year . It has lots of room inside , standard four-wheel drive , more power than any of the other small sport-utilities and a projected price of about $ 20,000 , loaded . CR-V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is longer , wider and taller than Toyota 's RAV4 , the Suzuki Sidekick , the Geo Tracker or the Kia Sportage . It has more storage room - 27.5 cubic feet - behind the rear seats and more rear seat legroom than even the Jeep Cherokee . <p> Future stock : A true North American-built minivan for 1999 ; next generation Accord for 1998 . <p> Infiniti <p> The flagship Q45 is redesigned for 1997 and more squarely aimed at its Japanese rival , the Lexus LS400 . The new Q45 is 204 pounds lighter , slightly smaller overall and less powerful than the old version . The wheelbase is two inches shorter and the new car is a bit shorter and narrower . Interior space is a bit larger with front seat passengers giving up a little room for rear seat occupants . The displacement of the V-8 engine has been reduced to 4.1 liters and cranks out 266 horsepower to 278 in the old model . <p> The QX4 , a very tony version of the Nissan Pathfinder , rolls into Infiniti showrooms late this fall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All-Mode four-wheel-drive system . Leather-appointed interior and a 150-watt Bose audio system moves it upstream from its Pathfinder roots . Antilock brakes are standard . Price starts a smidgeon under $ 40,000 . <p> Jaguar <p> The widely praised XK8 coupe and convertible have reminded Jag lovers of classics like the E-type and XK 120 . The cars were so popular in unveilings at auto shows in Geneva and New York earlier this year that the 2,200 XK8s allocated to the United States for the rest of this year are presold . Jaguar expects 60 percent of its first full-year model run of 12,000 will come to the United States . The XK8 features a new V8 engine , the first ever designed by Jaguar , that puts out 290 horsepower . It is mated with a new five-speed automatic transmission . <p> The XJ6 L joins the Jaguar lineup in the United States . It is a long wheelbase version of the XJ6 that previously had been sold in other parts of the world . <p> Jeep <p> The old standby Cherokee might look little different but looks are deceiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seals cut down on noise vibration and harshness . A new steel liftgate is easier to operate , the mirrors are larger and the exterior has a new grille and bumpers with integrated bumper guards . <p> Wrangler is all new , including the signature Jeep grille and round headlights famous from earlier Jeep models . The hood hinges and fasteners are exposed but flush with surrounding sheet metal for a cleaner appearance and improved operation . The base of the windshield is pulled forward to improve aerodynamics and to provide space for the new instrument panel with air bags . It 's still able to be folded down , however . Seats are all new with six inches more width in the rear . The soft and hardtop systems have been redesigned for better sealing , less wind noise and easier operation . The new hardtop is 15 pounds lighter . The soft top is supported by three hinged bows that fold rearward like a conventional convertible . <p> Future stock : First major refreshening of the Grand Cherokee is due for 1998 . <p> Lexus <p> Toyota 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new for 1997 . It is 2.4 inches longer than the current model , but the same basics taken from the Toyota Camry remain . The front-wheel-drive 24-valve 3.0-liter V6 gets a boost in horsepower from 188 to 200 , and torque goes up to 214 pounds from 203 pounds . With leather interior , the price should be about $ 34,000 . <p> The flagship LS 400 becomes the first car from a Japanese nameplate to offer side-impact air bags . <p> More aggressive front and rear styling debut on the SC 400/300 coupes . <p> Lincoln <p> Traditional American luxury costs less at Lincoln this fall . All three of the division 's cars - the Town Car , Mark VIII and Continental - come with the same price , $ 37,950 . That 's $ 4,520 less than the least expensive ' 96 Continental , $ 2,370 less on the Mark VIII but $ 370 more for the Town Car . Mark VIII lives up to its technological testbed reputation this fall with new lighting tricks that are industry firsts . It has a full neon taillight that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind it will see the light sooner , presumably making rear-end accidents less likely . <p> Future Stock : The Lincoln Navigator , opulence personified in a sport-utility vehicle , arrives next summer . It 's a gussied-up Ford Expedition . The as-yet unnamed entry-level luxury car , which goes by the codename DEW98 , is actually a 1999 model and will share a lot of its chassis with a new Jaguar . <p> Mazda <p> The Protege sedan gets a restyled front end - bumpers , fenders , grille and headlights - for more styling continuity with the 626 and Millenia . <p> The V6 engine in the 626 sedan and MX6 coupe gets a boost to provide more power and torque ( 164 horsepower at 5,600 rpm and 160 foot pounds at 4,800 rpm ) . <p> The Miata roadster gets a Touring Package that includes power steering , windows and mirrors , alloy wheels and leather-wrapped steering wheel . <p> The MPV rear-drive minivan features an All-Sport package that includes stone guard , grille guard , eyebrow fender flares , rear bumper guard , mud and snow tires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of those cars that gets so much attention , you forget it 's not even on sale yet . Good luck finding one when they are . Mercedes said its production is sold out until the second quarter of 1998 . Only 5,000 of 36,000 cars a year are planned for export from Bremen , Germany , to the United States . A big surprise is the price . At a bit under $ 40,000 , the SLK is continuing the price retrenchment that started with Mercedes C-Class cars a few years ago and continued with the redesigned E-Class models . What 's really special here is the roof . The folding top combines a coupe with a convertible . Five hydralic cylinders take 25 seconds to fold or unfold the roof into the trunk . Forget about using the trunk when the roof is stored there , however . Trunk space shrinks from 12.3 cubic feet to just 5.1 cubic feet . The SLK will come equipped with the first system that can sense the presence of a child seat in the passenger seat and automatically turn off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact , sister to the Escort , and the Mountaineer , a barely changed version of the Ford Explorer , are already on sale as 1997s . The Cougar XR7 turns 30 with a special anniversary edition model complete with a dark red paint job , anniversary emblems and bright , lacy spoked wheels . <p> Mitsubishi <p> Seven of the Japanese automaker 's eight U.S. models are all new or restyled for 1997 . The flagship Diamante sedan , a compact sport-utility vehicle called Montero Sport and revised versions of the Mirage sedan and coupe are new . The Galant midsize sedan , Eclipse sporty coupe and 3000GT sports car get significant changes . <p> Nissan <p> The Maxima sedans get a revised look for 1997 , including a new grille , headlights , taillights , bumpers and trunk lid . Same for the 240SX sports coupe . <p> Oldsmobile <p> Oldsmobile gets a version of the Chevrolet Malibu next spring . It will be called the Cutlass . The current Cutlass Supreme goes away , as does the venerable Ciera , which also once wore the Cutlass name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new minivans . GM 's oldest division turns 100 in 1997 . <p> Plymouth <p> Good luck finding one when the Plymouth Prowler goes on sale in January . Chrysler will make only 3,000 of them a year . Prowler joins the Dodge Viper as a signature car expected to create a halo over the rest of Plymouth 's reborn lineup . Price tag for the street-legal hot rod wannabe is about $ 35,000 . <p> Pontiac <p> Wide track is back . That 's what Pontiac likes to say in gatefold ads in magazines . The car to get the time-honored description is the new Grand Prix . It 's the first of GM 's revamped midsize cars out of the chute , and Pontiac got a lot of say about the suspension and chassis basics . Pontiac hopes the sedan version of the Grand Prix succeeds where the current version flopped - persuading the young family that it can have the throaty vroom of a sports car in the shell of a sedan . To be sure it could deliver on the looks part of the equation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It 's typically done the other way around . The two cars share all sheet metal except the doors , rear windows and quarter panels . The new model is clean , accomplishing a highly detailed and stylized look without the current car 's plastic body cladding , which was used to distinguish it from other GM cars and create its sporty appearance . What about wide track ? Well , the front tread is two inches wider than the 1996 model and the rear is three inches wider . Two of the three models , the GT sedan and GT coupe , are due this fall . The more genteel and less powerful SE sedan will be available in January . <p> Pontiac also gets a replacement for the TransSport minivan late this fall , but it wo n't be around in big numbers until early next year . <p> Porsche <p> Sales of Porsche 's new mid-engine roadster called the Boxster start in the beginning of 1997 . Initially , the Boxster will be powered by a 201-horsepower , 24-valve , 2.5-liter flat six-cylinder engine . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1997 . <p> Saturn <p> The second generation SC1 and SC2 coupes follow last year 's redesigned sedans and wagons . They 're rounder , roomier and a whole lot quieter than the cars they replace . <p> Like the sedans and wagons , the coupes have gotten longer , too , sharing the 102.4-inch wheelbase ( the measurement between axles ) . Everything noticeable on the outside of the cars have received a makeover . <p> Under the hood , the choice is still between a single overhead cam 1.9-liter engine that puts out a puny 100 horsepower at 5,000 rpm or the dual-overhead cam that gets a more respectable 124 horsepower at 5,500 rpm . <p> Future stock : Saturn 's first midsize sedan is planned as a 1999 model . <p> Subaru <p> An Outback Sport model joins its Impreza lineup . It features more horsepower and torque but gets better fuel economy with a 2.2-liter engine . <p> The Legacy 2.5-liter GT will be available with a five-speed manual transmission . <p> Toyota <p> The biggest news from Japan 's largest automaker is a redesigned Camry midsize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quieter , lighter and more powerful with better ride quality . And it will probably cost less than last year 's model . The four-cylinder and six-cylinder engines both kick out more horsepower and a five-speed manual transmission on the V6 returns . The wheelbase has been increased by two inches , which helps improve interior space . The glove box can hold 29 percent more stuff , and a second power port has been added for cellular phones and other electronic equipment . Safety advances include optional integrated child seats and traction control , which is a first for a front engine , front-wheel-drive Toyota . Anti-lock brakes are now standard on all models but the four-cylinder CE . <p> The Paseo will offer a manually operated convertible top for 1997 . <p> Corolla drops its station wagon model . <p> The Supra Turbo with a six-speed manual transmission returns to the lineup for 1997 . <p> Two-wheel-drive Tacoma compact pickups get a minor front-end redesign to make them more closely resemble four-wheel-drive models . <p> Future Stock : A U.S.-built minivan debuts next spring , replacing the Previa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model , which stands for Turbo Direct Injection . It is a diesel that is quiet and gets 49 miles per gallon in highway driving . <p> Jetta gets a sports package version called Jetta GT , which is essentially a four-cylinder version of the Jetta GLX . The Cabrio ( convertible ) will offer a value-priced model with a base sticker of about $ 18,000 . <p> Future Stock : Volkswagen 's biggest car , the Passat , will see slicker styling and improved safety features when it arrives in the United States next spring . The new Beetle , a reincarnation of the VW classic , debuts in the first quarter of 1998 . A replacement for the current Golf/Jetta is due in early 1998 based on a front-drive chassis used by the Audi A3 . <p> Volvo <p> The 850 GLT models have a new engine package that delivers 190 horsepower and peak torque of 197 pound-feet at just 1,800 rpm.
