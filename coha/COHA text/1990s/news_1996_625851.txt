<p> Policy is too far gone Regarding the Feb. 13 letter , " " Social norms in Mexico , " about 22-year-old Pedro Sotelo and 14-year-old Adela Quintana who are new parents : <p> Pardon my arrogance if you believe there ca n't be anything wrong with noncitizens and illegal aliens feeling that they have an indisputable right to violate U.S. and Texas law based on morals in their homelands . <p> Just letting the young parents " " be " would perpetuate the already too-far-gone immigration policy we now enjoy . <p> I must be getting old because this type of sensitivity is shaking my liberal foundation . <p> Gregory C. Tatosian , Humble <p> Not an easy task <p> Regarding the Feb. 10 letter , " " Citizenship is easiest hurdle " : <p> Obtaining U.S. citizenship is easy ? Since when ? <p> As a board-certified immigration attorney , I know that obtaining U.S. citizenship is not an easy matter . It is not " " open to all who really want to receive it . " <p> Someone born overseas can derive U.S.citizenship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. citizen meets certain requirements . <p> With few exceptions , everyone else must go through the process of becoming a lawful permanent resident ( LPR/ " " green-card holder " ) first . Most people can not qualify for LPR/ " " green card " status , and Congress may vote soon to restrict even further the few remaining legal bases for obtaining LPR status . <p> The reasons why an individual would not qualify for lawful permanent resident status include , but are not limited to , the following : <p> Not having an employer willing to sponsor him/her and not having the unique job skills and education required to be approved . <p> Not having a qualified spouse , parent , son/daughter or sibling willing to sponsor him/her . <p> Insufficient proof to win asylum in the United States . <p> Convictions for , and/or commission of , certain types of crimes . <p> Too little income . <p> Misrepresenting facts to an immigration or U.S. embassy official . <p> Having a contagious disease . <p> Depending on the manner in which an individual is granted LPR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to apply for citizenship ; then , in Houston , another three to 10 months until approved by the U.S.Immigration and Naturalization Service and yet another month until the U.S. district court judge conducts a swearing-in ceremony . <p> U.S.citizenship easy ? Not hardly . <p> Janet B.Beck , Houston <p> Educate citizens first <p> I fail to see to how it is my country 's responsibility to educate anyone who is not a U.S. citizen . <p> I ca n't believe that people expect the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo to give scholarship money to students who are not U.S. citizens . <p> If that were the case , being a U.S. citizen would n't mean very much because just anybody could try to qualify for and receive any benefits that the country offers . <p> With the privileges you receive as a citizen comes the responsibility of staying in that country as a productive , contributing member of society . It means learning the language and assimilating . It means educating your children in that country 's culture and customs . It means getting out to vote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were possible for everybody on the planet to receive a decent education . It would do more to eradicate hunger , disease , poverty , crime and just plain meanness than almost anything else . But this is not a perfect world ; we have the responsibility of educating U.S. citizens above all others in this country . <p> Susan S.Garfield , Houston <p> We need a third party We have lost our first serviceman in Bosnia . I hope all voters remember this in November . President Clinton sent them over there against the wishes of the vast majority of the American people , and U.S. Sen. Bob Dole , R-Kan. , agreed with him . <p> If the United States ever needed a third party that cares about our country and our people , it is now . <p> W. R. Bockmon , Madisonville <p> Allow adults to decide <p> The Clinton administration 's proposals to curb teen-age tobacco smoking should be applauded as a model of how the war on drugs should have been fought from the very beginning . <p> The proposed regulations have been characterized as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all compared to putting people in jail for possessing marijuana -a demonstrably less dangerous drug than alcohol or tobacco . <p> We should be doing everything we can to discourage drug use by teen-agers , short of telling them lies and putting them in prison if they ignore our advice . Adults should be allowed to decide for themselves whether they want to use the drug or not , and they should be punished by law only if they sell to children . <p> G. Alan Robison , Houston <p> Get tough with abusers Regarding Patricia L. Hart 's Feb. 10 letter , " " Help these little ones , " regarding child abuse : <p> I have to ask myself if these child abusers are ignorant , uneducated people . Could it be that they were raised in such a home ? In either case , perhaps education can prevent some of these little helpless souls from being hurt . <p> There should be a mandatory jail sentence for repeated child abusers . I am referring to a minimum of 10 to 20 years incarceration , depending on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent think twice before setting a toddler in scalding water or slamming an infant against a door jam . Like Ms. Hart , I urge everyone to join in the fight to help ratify the laws concerning these deplorable child abusers . <p> Vickie D. Bell , Houston <p> l <p> If nations ' luck holds <p> Candidate Pat Buchanan 's speeches appeal not only to the Christian Coalition , but to Americans concerned about job export and disparity of income as well . <p> The Christian Coalition 's agenda would , if successful , exert monumental governmental invasions into our private lives . <p> Halting the flow of U.S.jobs to the Third World is at once a threat to big corporations . Pat seems to be at odds with GOP philosophy of minimizing government interference . <p> If the United States ' luck holds , Buchanan will continue his campaign rhetoric loud and clear , but will fall short of the presidency . Heard enough times , voters wo n't be suckered into promoting a theocracy by his concern for jobs . <p> In the end , Pat 's service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address protecting not only the wall of separation , but our livelihood as well . We can not prosper fighting over religion . If other Americans ca n't afford to buy goods and services , none of us can get paid . <p> Dave Martin , Houston <p> Failure to disseminate The scientists are claiming our propellants have produced holes in the ozone layer over the North and South Poles . <p> Curious how the pollutants accumulate at the poles instead of over population areas . Even more curious is how they escaped the Earth 's gravitational pull . <p> These are the same scientists who 60 years ago thought the ozone layer was impenetrable and would crush any spaceship trying to pass through it . What we have here is a failure to disseminate . <p> This is just another case of credentialed " " Chicken Little " environmentalists trying to return us to the Stone Age . What they do n't realize is that if they were successful in reversing progress , they would be the first ones to perish in a primitive environment . <p> Charles Skelton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician , I read with interest the Feb. 1 letter by Dr. James R. Birge about health maintence organization <p> Birge appears to be charmed by the HMOs . Not all physicians agree with him . It seems evident that people can not get better care from insurance companies than they could have by private-free physicians . Dr. Michael DeBakey wrote a very pessimistic Outlook article about HMOs on June 18 , 1995 . I and many others agree with him . <p> And the worst is yet to come when the physicians are sufficiently captured and can do nothing else but stay with a socialized medicine program . <p> I am inclined to agree with the Russians who have much more knowledge of government-regulated medicine , etc. than we . <p> They say the difference between an optimist and a pessimist is that the pessimist is just better informed . <p> Eugene A. Tips , Houston <p> A national sales tax <p> Three cheers for the Feb. 8 letter , " " Try a national sales tax , " by Joyce Bowman . <p> Of all the methods of tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairest . <p> What about those who make bundles of money in illegal activities ? They 're going to eventually spend that money , right ? The machinery for the collection of sales taxes is already in place , so the retailers would not have any significant added burden . This system would encourage Americans to save , thus freeing up more money for lending and giving the economy a much needed boost . <p> Cheryl L. Sanders , Cypress <p> We must keep a Republican majority in Congress <p> Regarding the Feb. 7 Outlook article by Kevin Phillips , in which he calls the 104th Congress the worst in 50 years : <p> This Congress would be the best Congress in 50 years if it were not for the socialist duo Gore and Clinton . <p> It is time to once and for all downsize our government whereby a 10 percent tax rate will work . <p> It is time for neighbors , families , nieghbors and churches to help people in need . <p> It is time for sound business decisions in the spending of taxpayers ' money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on the color of your skin . <p> It is time to rehabilitate first-time offenders and throw the key away for repeat offenders , as well as swift justice after one appeal for death row inmates . <p> It is time to remove or improve laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act , which has become nothing more than a field day for lawyers . <p> It is time to allow the American people to invest in a real retirement fund that gives back with a profit , a truly secure income , rather than steal from the people under the disguise of " " Social Security . " <p> It is time the people majority realize that their personal wealth and value will only grow if this country is solvent , not bankrupt as it is now . <p> It is time therefore , to back our money with something besides a promise that the money has value or at least will have someday . <p> It is time that the politicians be under laws governing perjury when they make statements to the American people . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow Clinton and Gore are able to be re-elected , then the above goals will never be discussed , let alone achieved therefore keeping this country and its people in peril . <p> Warren A. Howell , Houston
