<p> Gold bugs die hard . <p> Jean-Marie Eveillard , the portfolio manager of the Sogen Gold fund , takes heart by recalling a recent comment by Alan Greenspan , the Federal Reserve chairman , that gold is still the " ultimate form of payment . " <p> Mr. Eveillard said , " You ca n't say that about copper and pork bellies . " <p> No you ca n't . But you ca n't bank on gold anymore , either . Indeed , in the nearly six years since Mr. Eveillard started the gold fund , it has lost , on average , about 8 percent a year for its investors . Only the threat of a worsening global financial crisis last fall stopped Mr. Eveillard from liquidating the fund at the end of 1998 . <p> In fact , gold  --  once the dependable haven for millions of worried investors  --  looks a lot like just another sinking commodity these days in a world financial system dominated by inflation-fighting central bankers . Even Swiss bankers , the doyens of gold , do not push it anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now many more efficient ways to hedge risk . And a whole generation of investors can only imagine the glory days when the price of gold cleared $800 an ounce for two days in January 1980 . <p> " At some point I have to say I think I have been wrong so long that maybe I am missing something , " Mr. Eveillard admitted reluctantly . " Maybe I was just being stubborn . " <p> In the nearly two decades since the price of gold peaked , there have not been many good seasons for the precious metal . It last touched $500 an ounce in December 1987 , and it has not fetched $400 since April 1996 . Its average price for 1998 , $294 an ounce , was the lowest in 20 years . <p> But 1999 is turning out to be especially harsh and is clearly trying the patience of even the most devoted gold bugs . Unfortunately for them , the strongest argument for gold and its special qualities is that its price is doing exactly what it should be doing in an environment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nemeses these days are the world 's central banks , which are likely to control the outlook for some time to come . <p> Many central banks are selling or planning to sell portions of their huge hoards of gold , a looming presence that has driven down the price by almost 30 percent since the selling announcements by the banks accelerated in 1997 . Central banks controlled about 23 percent of the above-ground stocks of gold at the end of 1998 , according to Gold Fields Mineral Services , a leading precious metals research firm based in London . They have sold more than 3,100 tons of gold since 1989 . <p> At the same time , they are succeeding in reducing inflation , a force that has traditionally pushed the price of gold higher . <p> All this allows speculators to make a pretty safe bet  --  that gold will fall . And they have added to the downward pressure by selling gold months ahead in the futures market and pocketing easy profits . <p> " Most things are conspiring against gold , " said Philip Klapwijk , managing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold 's age-old role as a haven against political or financial disaster has been the opening of financial markets throughout the world . That means investors in many nations can put their money in another currency and in foreign stocks and bonds . In addition , there are many more sophisticated ways to hedge against risk these days . And often , as happened last year at the low point of the global financial crisis , buying United States Treasury securities is as safe as buying gold , and much easier to do . <p> The shift has been reflected in gold 's recent reactions to world political and financial crises . Gold managed to top $400 an ounce when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 and again when the United States and its allies started a land war in January 1991 to force Saddam Hussein 's army out of Kuwait . But the price plunged again quickly , even with the threat of a surge in oil prices . Gold did not budge this spring with the threat of a land war in Kosovo that could have sucked in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rally in any of the big selloffs in the stock market , either in 1987 or in 1998 . In fact , the price of gold was higher before August 1998 than it was after the Russian currency devaluation that month and the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management , the giant hedge fund , both of which prompted the Federal Reserve to engineer three one-quarter-point cuts in interest rates to calm the world 's financial markets . <p> Yes , there is the Year 2000 computer bug to worry about . But the fear of a computer crisis as the new millennium begins has contributed more to the record sale this year of 1.54 million 10th-of-an-ounce American Eagle gold coins  --  favored by millennium bug alarmists  --  than to the price of gold itself . Some analysts still say gold will spike higher as the year 2000 draws closer . <p> The debate on gold 's relationship to inflation , however , is unlikely to be settled until there is another serious threat . <p> Lawrence Kudlow , the chief economist at American Skandia Life Assurance in Shelton , Conn. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation . <p> " I would argue that the gold signal is pointing toward zero inflation and , hence , its price should be easing down , " he said . " The gradual elimination of inflation renders gold a poor investment . That is how it should be . People should be buying stocks . " <p> Gold has so far failed to react to the latest ado over inflation . That is surprising , since interest rates have shot higher this year in part , traders say , because of fear that the jump in oil prices , a seesaw run-up in other commodity prices and a rebound in growth in Asia and Latin America will push consumer inflation to the 2.5 percent range , up from the 1.6 percent increase in 1998 . The Consumer Price Index was up 2.3 percent for the 12 months through April . But perhaps that is simply too small a jump to stimulate action in gold . <p> The worst news this year for gold was the Bank of England 's announcement in early May that it planned to sell 415 metric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullion over the next several years . Even the World Gold Council , a trade group that represents big mining companies , acknowledged that Britain 's decision would be seen as " further evidence of official disenchantment with gold as a reserve asset . " <p> The first 25 metric tons ( 803,775 ounces ) will be sold in July ; other auctions will follow , with the aim of selling 125 tons ( four million ounces ) a year . Since the announcement , the price of gold has plunged 7.8 percent , to $260.35 an ounce , just above the 20-year low of $258.60 , reached last week . <p> Britain 's big move , which amounts to shedding 58 percent of its stockpile , came on top of sales already announced over the last several years by the central banks of Belgium , Argentina , the Netherlands and the Czech Republic . If it sets off a competition among central banks to sell before the price falls too much lower , it will reverberate in the gold market for years . <p> And there are other major official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a plan that could result in the eventual sale of 1,300 tons ( 41.8 million ounces ) of its gold reserves . Part of the money would go to survivors of the Holocaust and relatives of the victims . And the International Monetary Fund is considering selling about 161 tons ( 5.2 million ounces ) of its reserves and using the proceeds to help the world 's poorest countries . <p> Central banks are also undermining the price of gold by lending their reserves to be used in trades that make it easier for gold producers to sell their product in futures markets . <p> Given this year 's price decline , Mr. Eveillard said his Sogen fund , which makes its bets on gold by buying stocks of gold companies , might become one of the casualties of the rout . Many gold mines have already fallen victim , including Bannockburn , Bullabulling and Mount Morgans in Australia , which have closed , and Canada 's Royal Oak Mines , which has gone into receivership . <p> Even the apparent good news for the industry  --  that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . In 1998 , according to Gold Fields , the total cash cost of production fell almost 18 percent , to $206 an ounce . This means there is an incentive to produce more , only adding to the supply . <p> " It is a market with no upside , " said Bruce L. Cleland , the chief executive officer of Campbell &; Company in Baltimore , a money manager that deals in foreign exchange and financial and commodity futures , including a tiny bit of gold . As an unapologetic gold bear , he believes that gold " has been essentially demonetized by the modern financial economy . " <p> But Joseph F. Ippolito , a registered investment adviser in Malvern , Pa. , feels differently . <p> He started buying gold stocks in 1969 and until recently had 10 percent to 15 percent of his portfolio in two gold mining companies , TVX Gold Inc. and the Bema Gold Corporation , and one gold mutual fund . <p> The plunge in the price of gold has cut that share quite a bit . TVX is now worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62.5 cents  --  both less than one-third of the value of their 1998 highs . <p> Yet for him , he said , " hope springs eternal . <p> " I 'm staying in good health , " Mr. Ippolito , 61 , added . " I intend to be around . Sooner or later there will be a traditional world crisis and gold will respond . " <p> http : //www.nytimes.com In an era of low inflation , open markets and sophisticated financial alternatives , gold has steadily lost value and no longer serves as a haven during political or financial crises .
