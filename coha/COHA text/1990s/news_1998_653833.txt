<p> Christmas is a sacred holiday in the Philippines , and nowhere is that more evident than at the headquarters of Philippine Airlines here . Religious statues adorn executive offices , and signs throughout the building announce a holiday Mass in the main lobby . <p> In these dark days , when its frazzled executives are struggling to keep the airline aloft , a Mass seems entirely appropriate : One can not help thinking that what the airline needs is divine intervention . <p> With $2.2 billion in debt , plunging revenues , and losses of close to $1 million a day , Asia 's oldest airline , known as P.A.L. , is in desperate shape . When negotiations for Cathay Pacific Airways to acquire a stake collapsed earlier this month , several analysts said the airline 's options were running out . <p> " The rescue effort is not just huge , it is astronomical , " said Nicholas Ionides , a Singapore-based editor of Air Transport Intelligence , a news agency that covers the industry . " The question is , Do you keep an airline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they should just shut it down . " <p> But Philippine Airlines is not just another shipwreck of a company . It is the nation 's flag carrier , a state company until after the ouster of Ferdinand E. Marcos , when it was spun off to a group of investors led by Lucio C. Tan , an ethnic Chinese who traded on his ties to Marcos to amass one of the greatest fortunes in the Philippines . It is now the crown jewel in Mr. Tan 's empire . <p> Mr. Tan is a leading supporter of the new President of the Philippines , Joseph E. Estrada , not only contributing to his campaign but also giving him the use of his planes . When a labor dispute prompted Mr. Tan to shut down the 57-year-old airline in September , provoking tears from Filipinos , it was Mr. Estrada who brokered an agreement that got the planes flying again . <p> " For Estrada , it 's a mark of political prestige to save the airline , and Lucio Tan knows it , " said Alexander R. Magno , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization in Manila . <p> In the murky world of Asian business , where friendships often count more than solvency , Philippine Airlines would seem to be the classic candidate for a government bailout . The catch is that Mr. Estrada , wanting foreign investors to view the Philippines as having a level playing field , has ruled out injecting any public money . <p> As the losses pile up , though , Philippine Airlines will be an acid test for this movie star-turned-politician , who has been in office for six months . Mr. Estrada , 61 , may find it hard not to help a friend in need , even if it reinforces the image of the Philippines as a den of crony capitalism . <p> " It 's going to be very tough for Estrada , " said Christian Monzad , former chairman of the Philippine Election Commission and a consultant to the Lopez Group , a Filipino conglomerate . " He is very loyal to his friends , and he would like to repay his political debts . " <p> Mr. Estrada 's decision will be watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar issues . In Indonesia , the Government has refused to aid companies with ties to its fallen President , Suharto . But in Malaysia , Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has continued to pump public money into private companies . <p> In the Spartan offices of Philippine Airlines , senior executives insist they can go it alone . On Dec. 7 , they submitted a rehabilitation plan to the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission that would turn P.A.L . from a sprawling national airline into a compact carrier focused on profitable routes . <p> The airline said it would prune its fleet , which was aggressively expanded in the years leading up to the Asian economic crisis , to 22 planes from 53 . It would cut its domestic routes to 17 from 36 and its international routes to 13 from 26 , though it would keep the Los Angeles and San Francisco routes . <p> The loss of routes has eroded some fond traditions here . Philippine Airlines used to ferry home for the holidays scores of Filipinos who work abroad  --  often at cut-rate fares it can no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from North America streamed into Manila via Hong Kong on Cathay Pacific . <p> " I think we have a very good chance of rehabilitating this airline , although we need the support of the major stakeholders , " said Jaime J. Bautista , chief financial officer of Philippine Airlines . <p> The trouble is , the finances do not add up . The airline says it needs $150 million in fresh capital to overhaul its operations and begin paying off its debt . Mr. Tan and other shareholders will come up with $90 million , and the rest would come from new investors . <p> After the collapse of the talks with Cathay Pacific , analysts said they doubted that Philippine Airlines would find a white knight . Mr. Bautista conceded that the carrier was not talking to any other airlines , though he has retained Chase Manhattan Bank to scour the world for potential partners . <p> In the meantime , Mr. Bautista said , he saw nothing wrong with the Government throwing the airline a few favors . <p> " A national flag carrier is very important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man whose punishing work schedule has made him look a good deal older than his 41 years . " Governments have always been there to help . " <p> Mr. Tan declined to be interviewed . But Mr. Bautista said the airline deserved help because his boss had been treated unfairly by the Government . In truth , Mr. Tan 's experience is more a case of ending up on the wrong side of history . Under the Marcos regime , he made a fortune in the cigarette and beer businesses  --  in no small part through Government tax breaks . <p> But after Marcos was ousted in 1986 , Mr. Tan got a chillier reception from his successors , Corazon C. Aquino and Fidel V. Ramos . The 64-year-old tycoon was hit with a $1 billion tax-evasion lawsuit that was finally dismissed by the Supreme Court in 1996 . And he no longer enjoyed preferential treatment . <p> None of this stopped Mr. Tan from adding to his empire . He first invested in Philippine Airlines in 1992 and won control in 1996 . But Mr. Ramos , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition , licensing rivals like Air Philippines , Cebu Pacific and Grand Air . <p> Mr. Bautista said the new airlines competed with Philippine Airlines on profitable routes , like flights to the resort island of Cebu . But the Government required the airline to continue serving money-losing " missionary routes "  --  outposts in this vast archipelago where the planes often fly empty . <p> Mr. Bautista said the Government also allowed foreign carriers to increase flights to Manila , enabling them to undercut P.A.L . ' s fares . Last week , the airline asked the Estrada administration to cut back the flights open to foreign carriers to pre-Ramos levels . Edgardo B. Espiritu , the Finance Secretary , said the Government would probably grant the request to reverse the " unhealthy actions " of the previous administration . <p> Mr. Magno of the Foundation for Economic Freedom said these protections " would restore P.A.L . to monopoly status . " <p> The Government is not stopping there . Mr. Espiritu has asked several Government-affiliated banks to make bridge loans to Philippine Airlines . The president of the Philippine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airline , has resisted the idea . But the Government is the bank 's largest shareholder , with a 45 percent stake , so he may have little choice . <p> Still , it is not clear that cash alone will solve the problem . Analysts said Philippine Airlines was being choked by a bloated payroll . The airline has trimmed its ranks from 12,986 employees to 8,589 since May . But industry experts said it would have to cut that to 2,000 to compete with more efficient carriers like Cathay Pacific or Singapore Airlines . <p> " When you 've got too many employees sitting around , they get into other problems : they go on strike , they organize unions , " said Jim Eckes , an aviation consultant at Indoswiss Ltd. in Hong Kong . <p> Indeed , a strike by employees precipitated the airline 's near-death experience in September , when Mr. Tan shut down the carrier after its unions refused to accept a drastic cost-cutting plan . After two weeks of frantic mediation by Mr. Estrada , the unions voted to give up a collective-bargaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airline and three board seats . <p> The agreement gave Mr. Tan some breathing room to cut the payroll . But Mr. Eckes said it would be politically untenable to trim enough workers to make it genuinely competitive . And hacking away at costs does not erase the carrier 's debt load , which , at $2.2 billion , is larger than its estimated breakup value of $1.6 billion . <p> The airline 's creditors  --  which include local and foreign banks , plus export-import banks in the United States and Europe  --  must approve the rescue plan . But short of a nasty battle over the airline 's planes , they do not have a better option . <p> Two questions now hang over Philippine Airlines . The first is whether it is really worth saving . Some analysts contend that other carriers already serve the most critical domestic and international routes , and that a new airline  --  without P.A.L . ' s baggage  --  could soon claim the mantle of flag carrier . <p> " If you are nonemotional about it , there is no loss , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation at A. T. Kearney in Hong Kong . " If you are emotional about it , this is a tragedy . " <p> The second question is , Can Philippine Airlines be saved with Mr. Tan ? In the negotiations with Cathay Pacific , he refused to relinquish control , which ultimately doomed the talks . Mr. Bautista said Mr. Tan was willing to hand over day-to-day operations , but insisted on retaining control of the board . <p> Industry experts said no investor would put up money to revive the airline unless it gained control . Perhaps the one person who could ease Mr. Tan out of the cockpit is President Estrada . But in an interview last month , Mr. Estrada seemed more intent on praising Mr. Tan than prodding him . <p> " We have to admire Mr. Lucio Tan , " he said , " because in spite of losing big money , I was able to prevail upon him to continue losing money . " <p> And how was the President able to do that ? <p> " He has attained his goal as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he leaves the world , he wants to do something for his country .
