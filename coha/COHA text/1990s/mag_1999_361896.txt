Forget for a moment The Godfather  --  the 21 million-selling book and the movie that virtually created the Mafia as literary and cinematic subject . Forget The Fortunate Pilgrim , The Sicilian , The Last Don and other best sellers . Forget Superman , Earthquake and the rest of the blockbusters . Forget two Academy Awards . Forget that he wrote some of the best stuff ever about the American family and the Italian-American immigrant experience . Forget that all this was done by the son of illiterate immigrant parents . <P> I think of MARIO PUZO this way : When I was younger , struggling for a sense of place in the world of letters , this older , wiser author of indisputable talent and success not only offered me steady encouragement but took the time to read my adolescent jottings . But that was Mario : that smile , those mischievous eyes , that wry humor  --  one part paisano and one part prince . He treated everyone , from studio chiefs to busboys , exactly the same  --  well , maybe busboys a little better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade school . He taught me pinochle . And when I was in my 20s and he in his 70s , he took my calls when I had doubts about my work or questions about the business of books . Last time I saw him , he showed me a chart on which he had outlined his book Omerta . He joked that I could use it when he was done . <P>  --  Karl Taro Greenfeld , staff writer , TIME
