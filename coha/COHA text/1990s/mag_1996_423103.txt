Ask Candace Gingrich what catapulted her into the life of an activist for lesbian and gay rights , and she 'll look you in the eye and tell you flat out : the results of the 1994 congressional elections , the so-called Republican revolution engineered by her famous sibling and now Speaker of the House , a fellow named Newt . Ever since the Speaker 's lesbian half-sister took to the road last summer for a 52-city tour sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) , the inevitable comparisons have arisen between her and the First Brothers who came to be thorns in the sides of their presidential siblings . But those inclined to dismiss Candace Gingrich as a lesser mind bent on glitz and glory will find their hopes dashed by the cool intelligence and wry wit of the younger Gingrich , who , at 29 , is a woman on a mission born of her own experience . And , besides , her brother is n't president  --  yet " Last fall , two things happened , " she explains , " one being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself , ' Good days are over now . ' And the other thing being that my brother was elected Speaker and a reporter came to the house and asked me if I was gay . " Surely , she had prepared herself for the question ? " I did n't have to , " she says , " because I knew what the answer would be . " Although friends and family had known of her sexual orientation for years , it was Gingrich 's candor with an Associated Press reporter that changed her life forever . It drew the attention of Elizabeth Birch , executive director of the HRC , who saw in the fresh-scrubbed , freckled countenance of Candace Gingrich an ideal public face for the largest national lesbian and gay political organization in the U.S. Gingrich 's first public act for the HRC was to lobby Congress last March advocating renewed funding for AIDS research . The event caused such a hubbub in the press that the Speaker himself , who is not terribly close to his youngest sister , felt compelled to provide a bro/sis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of media scrutiny , Gingrich teamed with the HRC to promote the organization 's National Coming Out Project , which encourages closeted lesbians and gays to go public . This is seen as an important step in the HRC 's drive to end legal discrimination against gays in the workplace . ( The HRC 's research shows that 80 percent of Americans who say they know someone who is gay favor preventing job discrimination against lesbians and gays . ) On the road , says Gingrich , " there were a lot of gay and lesbian people I ran into who did n't realize they could be fired , who did n't realize that they could be denied housing , because of who they are . There 's a belief that ... it 's 1995 , that kind of stuff does n't happen anymore . " Born in 1966 , Candace was a latecomer to the Gingrich clan . Sisters Roberta and Susan were 16 and 18 when their baby sister was born , and , at 23 , half-brother Newt was already married to his first wife . Gingrich 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her father 's military career demanded . By the time she was five , her sisters had left home , leaving her to become something of an only child . At eight , when her father retired from the military , Gingrich returned with her parents to her birthplace of Harrisburg , Pennsylvania . There she would grow up in one place , an experience that the other Gingrich children never had . She speaks almost wistfully of the spirited camaraderie her older siblings say they shared with her parents around the dinner table . " I do n't know if my parents were just too tired by the time I was actually growing up , " she says , but she does give them heartfelt credit for being " willing to let me grow up as I was going to grow up . " Asked if the generational difference between her sisters , brother , and herself contributed to her difference in perspective from the rest of the gang , she muses in the cadence of her fellow Gen-Xers : " I think in a lot of instances when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 's kind of  --  not a hyper-maturity , but just a quickened , more heightened awareness of what 's going on . " Though Gingrich never really got to know Newt , he was a constant presence in her life , thanks to her mother 's boundless pride in her son 's achievements , which mounted ever higher over the course of Gingrich 's upbringing . She grew up feeling " a sibling rivalry with a sibling who was n't even around , " Gingrich told the Washington Post last March . She says that her sisters were " in the picture " enough during her childhood to form a bond with her , and it was Roberta who helped her little sister find a job after college . Politically , Gingrich sees both sisters as conservative , with Roberta Brown " very on Newt 's side , very conservative , " and Susan , who has retained her birth name after marrying , the more moderate . Gingrich seems closest to her mother , Kathleen . Although initially confounded by the concept of her daughter as a lesbian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , and no one in the family ever told her to hide her sexual orientation under a rock . While it is clear that generational differences helped set Gingrich on her own path , other events foreshadowed what may seem an abrupt embrace of an activist role . Growing awareness of social issues , especially the women 's movement , aroused her passion when Gingrich arrived at Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1985 to pursue a major in sociology with a concentration in women 's studies . It was there that she had her first brush with activism , through the abortion rights movement . It was also at college that Gingrich , the acknowledged athlete of her family , discovered the game of rugby , a sport she continues to avidly pursue in a Washington-area women 's union . Yet her attachment to rugby goes beyond the game itself . " It was , actually , how I came out , " she says . Before joining the college women 's rugby team , Gingrich had several friends who were lesbians , " but they were n't very comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning that " a number of women on the team were out , and they were happy and comfortable and proud , " that something " clicked .... It just took I being with people who were natural and normal about it for me to realize that the feelings I had been having were valid ones . " After graduation Gingrich went to work by day as a computer consultant at the Pennsylvania Department of Education and by night as a package sorter for United Parcel Service . She always figured that she would enroll in graduate school for a master 's in women 's studies so that she could teach , a goal she may one day pursue . For now , Gingrich has more immediate plans . She 's doing all she can to keep Congress from holding hearings on allegations that public schools are using taxpayer money to " recruit " students to " the gay lifestyle "  --  hearings that were called for by Reverend Lou Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition ( a Christian-right outfit specializing in antigay propaganda ) , who claims that Speaker Gingrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she heard it last spring ; she had never before acknowledged that her brother might support efforts that were antigay . " It really pissed me off , " she says , " and I sent him a fax . " In the fax she pledged to testify at any such hearings , should they be held . All along the road during her speaking tour , Gingrich has encountered the handiwork of the Christian right . In Des Moines , for example , she spoke at a reception with education activist Jonathan Wilson , a 12-year veteran of the city school board who had just lost his seat in a brutal campaign  --  to an opponent recruited by the Christian right , after Wilson revealed he was gay . Of detractors like those Wilson faced in Iowa , Gingrich says , " Just who do they think they are to call themselves Christians and preach hate ? " Encounters with people who are fighting the right in their neighborhoods have strengthened her conviction that there is a need for grassroots efforts to get out the vote . Also keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Field Action Network that the HRC is launching . Gingrich is n't quite sure what tack her work will take in 1996 . " There are a lot of options in an election year , " she says , with a twinkle in her eye . Which leads to the inevitable question , the one she heard throughout her speaking tour , which she 'll gladly articulate in the whiny voice she attributes to the reporters who ask it : " ' And if your brother ran for president , what would you do ? ' " Answer ? " It 's simple , " she says . " I 'm very loyal to my family , and I love them , but I 'm not going to support someone who does n't think I 'm worthy of the same rights as Americans who are n't gay  --  I do n't care who he is . " She pauses , then adds in a soft voice , " Not to mention that my brother is n't exactly prochoice .... " She may very well campaign for the presidential candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person could very well be Bill Clinton . In the meantime , Gingrich has taken some time off from the speaking trail to work on a book about her life . At the time Ms. spoke with her , she was also gearing up for her next encounter with Big Brother , whose company she expected to share at holiday time . " It 's not like we call each other up and chat , so that has n't really changed , " she explains . " What has changed , though , is that ... not only have I been energized by the things that I 've been finding out during six months on the road ... but the thousands of people I 've talked to and with have given me their energy and support .... There are a lot of unanswered questions about Newt 's positions that maybe I do n't want to know the answers to , but I 'm going to be very hard-pressed not to say anything . " As for her long-term future , Candace Gingrich declines to speculate . " I 'm a here-and-now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in the moment " sometimes gets you in the wrong way financially . " But , she adds , " What kind of financial rewards matter when you 're not free ? " Adele M. Stan is a freelance writer living in Weehawken , New Jersey <p>                     @x Gardiner , Montana <p> Edward Fiske stepped from the shadowed recesses of the front porch . The worn planks of the farmhouse creaked and groaned beneath his feet as he made his way down the rickety stairs and into the sunshine . It was a glorious morning . He paused , inhaling the sweet scent of dew and cottonwood trees . Emerald spears of late spring grass beckoned bare feet as they danced in the wind , ending in a graceful sweep at the banks of Yellowstone River . <p> The serenity of the homestead sent a warm tingle through Edward 's body , tugging his normally stern mouth into a slightly lopsided smile . He shook his head at the irony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mask for the evil that slept below . <p> Edward concentrated on centering his emotions . It would n't do at all to allow his technician to see the excitement that bubbled furiously in his gut . He was an impassive man . The itch of anticipation was not something he normally felt , but last night he had surpassed the Christmas Eve eagerness of his childhood . Each time he had stirred from sleep , his watch had mocked him . It had ticked through a layer of molasses , slowing the large hand to an infuriating snail 's pace . <p> But he 'd managed . <p> He 'd held himself in check . <p> His feet crushed the grass ; the tender blades bent and broke beneath the soles of his sneakers . He resisted the urge to race across the lawn but stepped up the pace and ignored the biting pain that clutched his upper chest . <p> After the sale , he 'd lose weight . He 'd have to . Touring the country and lecturing on his creation would take energy and a physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hair over the balding area of his head , pushing on toward his dream . <p> He rounded a grove of quaking aspens and halted . The dilapidated log cabin was a poor monument to the significance of what rested beneath its rotting logs and disintegrating roof . A worn and chipped cornerstone marked the front doorway . His eyes scanned the chiseled numbers , and he nodded to himself , puckering his lips in satisfaction . The date-stamp on the cabin reflected an era when men battled wilderness , forging past the obstacles created by forces unimaginable . It resembled a time of progression . Similar to him , Lewis and Clark were men of evolution . The success and failure they struggled through as they charted a waterway across North America coincided with Edward 's vision of his own career . It seemed fitting to have a cabin dating back to their era acting as a shield for his baby . <p> Pushing on the heavy front door , he scurried within and stopped inside the darkened room , allowing his eyes to adjust . The scent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room was littered with the carcasses of small rodents killed as they ingested the poison he 'd laid out to trap the menacing creatures . Wrinkling his nose in disgust , he crossed the hard-packed earthen floor toward the far wall and opened a small metal box , punching a sequence of numbers into the lighted keypad . <p> A brown cloud of dust particles rose from the floor as the doorway to the lab slid open . He hurried to the edge of the four-by-four opening , turned around , and began his descent down the steep metal stairs . His pudgy fingers grasped the railing . Concentrating on not missing a rung , Edward descended at a slow pace . <p> His mind whirled with visions of how he 'd present his creation . He 'd have to be careful because what lay below had Satan 's signature scrawled across it in blood-red letters . That thought stopped him . He liked it . It had an almost poetic tone , one that would fit nicely in his memoirs . With a mental note to write that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had once been a typical cellar . <p> The dawning of a new era was about to take place . His era . It was time for Edward Fiske 's name to be written next to Albert Einstein 's . When Isaac Newton 's principles of relativity were discussed , so would Edward Fiske 's DNA modification be expounded . <p> Yes , his heart beat faster . This day brought forth endless visions of scientific recognition . <p> " ' bout time , Eddie , " a muffled voice called from the end of the room . <p> Edward pulled a handkerchief from his back pocket and mopped the sweat dripping down his forehead . He quickly surveyed the laboratory . Black granite work surfaces were littered with an array of equipment , the far right corner more congested than normal . The night before he 'd shoved the three-sided laminar flow station against the back wall . Its air filtration system was no longer adequate . Stacks of unused petri dishes scattered the interior of the flow station , discarded and unnecessary . <p> A grin tugged at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requests . Life , the past few years , had been damn near Nirvana . He inhaled , releasing his breath slowly to calm the excited jumble of nerves , the tinny scent of humming electrical equipment overlaid by alcohol sterilization as sweet to him as his mother 's roses in spring . <p> Edward 's fingers tickled the cool ceramic of a white cylindrical container . He verified that the controls on top of the cryogenic storage tank were correct , then paused , splaying his fingers around the sides of the containment unit . His success lay inside . <p> " Eddie ? " <p> His assistant 's voice broke the moment of silent self-worship . His lab technician was hunched over a large microscope , his hands shoved into robot-type arms that stretched beyond a thick glass pane and into the negative airflow chamber . <p> " Well ? " Edward moved forward to stand beside the younger man . <p> " Take a look , boss . " Jason stepped away from the scope , scratching his ass . He shuffled in place and pushed loose strands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful he 'd soon be free of this **25;375;TOOLONG slice of humanity . If Jason were n't so damned clever with DNA replication , he 'd have dumped the kid years ago . <p> Bending forward , Edward peered into the lens . He adjusted the microscope . A brilliant red and green cell came into focus , moving ever so slightly within the solution smeared on the slide . Bingo . His version of Fifth Disease sparkled in the center of the cell . The modified genetic composition of CPV-2 that he 'd spent his entire lifetime perfecting weaved itself into the cell like Christmas lights on a tree . He 'd done it . <p> This human cell now sported the canine virus parvo . <p> All the interminable hours of waiting while Jason processed these little babies suddenly vanished . He glanced up , taking a second to freeze this moment in time . His technician smiled and laughed and Edward grinned , clapping him on the back . <p> " It 's finished . Five years of trial and error , and we 've finally succeeded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How soon until you meet with the big guys ? I want my bonus . " <p> Edward narrowed his eyes . Money was n't his motivation . It was the look of astonishment from his colleagues he craved . They would n't turn their backs this year at the conference . No . His strain of Fifth Disease would win the National Medal of Science , maybe even the Nobel , and the accolades of his brotherhood . <p> " We must show our investors our results . " Lost in thought , Edward tapped his forefinger against his mouth . He continued speaking , not really concentrating on what he said . " That 's what the grant outlines . A demonstration and then final payment . " His mind pictured rapturous applause . Recognition and respect . " However , we need to reverse this procedure and develop an antidote prior to releasing CPV-19 . No need to run the risk of exposure . " The whining tenor of Jason 's voice sliced through his inner reflections , and Edward snapped his attention back to his assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the edge of his shirt . <p> " Excuse me ? " <p> " We 've an entire chamber of results . Why do we need a demonstration ? Just send a picture . " <p> Edward curled his lip , disgusted by the younger man 's greed . Controlling the surge of anger , he faced the glass that separated the main part of the lab from the negative airflow chamber . The wolf remains , bloodied and trailing gore from all extremities , were piled haphazardly against one wall . " The results in this laboratory were never the objective . It 's the procedure and technology that the board seeks . This is a great leap forward in disease prevention and cure . The steps taken to achieve CPV-19 combined with the creation of the antidote will provide our benefactors with the humanitarian rewards they desire . " Lecture over , he crossed his arms over his chest and waited for more complaints . <p> Jason stopped , scratched his ass again , and sighed . " I 'll get right on the antidote . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm wiped . " <p> " Not before you dispose of the bodies . " Edward headed back to the metal stairs . He began to climb . Stopping halfway up he cleared his throat and turned around , watching the younger man secure his specimen and shut down the scope . Edward gasped for air in short , fast gulps , his nostrils flaring to draw in more oxygen . He 'd only climbed the bottom part of the ladder . Swearing , he calmed his breathing and summoned a commanding voice . " I noticed the wolf pens were empty . Did you destroy the last two ? " <p> Jason shot a quick look in his direction , then lowered his eyes and bent down to dig out the cover for the scope . " I took care of ' em . " He slipped the heavy plastic over the machine and offered Edward a lopsided smile . <p> " Good , " Edward said and climbed the rest of the way up . Whistling a little tune , he popped his head into the center of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh no longer bothered him . A perfume of success now lingered in the air . Nothing could stop him now . Nothing . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
