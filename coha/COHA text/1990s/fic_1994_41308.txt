My father bought his Pierce-Arrow in 1926 . The Pierce was one of the great cars of its day . It had huge headlights eyes growing right out of fenders . Ours , with its 20 coats of deep-green lacquer , had a handsome , reptile look . It had a beautiful box of tools right on the running board ; vases in the back where you could put cut flowers ; and , on the cylinders , little brass priming cups into which you squirted gasoline to start the engine in cold weather . <p> " Now , there 's a fine piece of machinery , " my father would say , admiring it . Then he would sock one of the fenders , producing a dull thud . <p> " Aluminum ! " he would say . The body was made of aluminum . The use of this metal for automobile bodies was a rare thing then . As a child , I had a notion that they saved enough aluminum foil from chewing gum until they had enough to make a car , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really knew how to handle the Pierce . At stop signs , he could make it play music by letting the clutch out a bit and shifting partway into gear . To play higher notes , he fed more gas to her . He could play the first part of " Valencia " and " Button Up Your Overcoat " as far as " when the wind blows , " but not as far as " free . " <p> " Are you sure you 're not hurting it ? " my mother would say . <p> " You ca n't hurt a piece of engineering like this transmission , " my father would say . <p> The older we got , the fonder he became of that car . And the older the Pierce got , the more ashamed of it Mama and the girls became . When we passed certain key locales in our home town of Buffalo , New York , where it was necessary to make an impression , they would slump down so they would n't be seen . They went down on Nottingham Terrace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temple Beth Zion . <p> Each year when the new-model cars came out , my mother left folders around the house , hoping something modern would catch my father 's eye . She hoped he 'd buy a car like the ones she rode in with other ladies to mah-jongg afternoons , or to the Fort Erie races . <p> He treated her automobile brochures with scorn . I remember the year the streamline Chrysler came out . My crowd thought it was terrific . My father stared at the folder . " Tin balloon ! " he scoffed . He tore it up , throwing it into our gas fireplace among the fake logs and moss . <p> Certain events connected with the Pierce stand as signposts in my life . I must have been eight when it caught fire . It was one of Buffalo 's cold , winter Sundays . We were getting ready to go to Sunday school . She would n't turn over . The oil was like molasses . " Well , Les , we 'll have to prime her , " my father said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gasoline , " I said . <p> " Do n't matter , you 'll just suck on that pipe there till she begins to siphon down , and we 'll catch some . " <p> " But , Daddy , I just had my breakfast ! What if I swallow the gasoline ? " I said . <p> " Suck , " he said . <p> For a moment I sucked unsuccessfully . Then a sudden rush of fuel gushed all over the engine . Since we had left the ignition switch on , it burst into flames . <p> " Fire alarm ! " My father waved toward the red box on the corner . Neighbors on their way to St. Mark 's next door were astonished to see me rushing against them to get to the firebox . I broke the glass and pulled the thing . I had always wanted to . <p> When I got back , my father and the Catholics were throwing snowballs on the fire . It was only smoke by then . When the firemen arrived , it was just a wisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiny , deep green . " What a finish ! " my father murmured to himself . <p> But gasoline and cornflakes and sliced bananas were too much for a Sunday-school boy . As I went upstairs to throw up , I saw the females of our house watching everything from the dining-room window . <p> " Is the car all burned up , Mama ? " my little sister asked . <p> " No , darn it ! " my mother said . <p> I did n't have to go to Sunday school that time . <p> The Pierce saved me from Sunday school another time , too . As always , I was dressed earlier than the girls . I had on my itchy navy-blue Sunday suit and my itchy blue overcoat . Both suit and coat had horsehairs in the lapels to keep their shape . I must have had a hundred dollars ' worth of horsehairs in that Sunday-school outfit . <p> I thought it would be a nice surprise for everybody if I got the Pierce out of the garage all by myself . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan . I would push the car until she got rolling down the hill of the drive . Then I would dash around to the front seat , leap into the car , and slam on the brakes when it reached the sidewalk . <p> That way , when my father and the girls came out of the house , there would be no tiresome getting that old car out of the garage . It would be a nice surprise . <p> I had to rock her several times . At first I thought she would n't go . But she did . She went like mad . She hurtled down the drive like 60 . The plan slipped out of my head . My only thought was to hang onto the bumper and stop that car . I was dragged like a dead mouse right down the drive , right through the Catholics , right into the street , where oncoming cars screeched their brakes . <p> The Pierce hit a large tree , which later turned brown . But it stopped . The front of my Sunday outfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was terribly embarrassed . I had climbed behind the wheel when my family appeared , open-mouthed , on the veranda . <p> " It was n't my fault , " I said . " She got away from me . " <p> I did n't have to go to Sunday school that time . Nor did I get to go to Shea 's North Park Theatre for the next ten Saturdays . <p> Not too long after that , however , I saved the lives of our entire family in the line of automotive duty . <p> It was springtime . My father had decided that we would get in the car and drive to Cleveland to visit our friends , the Alperins . We were still within the city when it began to snow . As sometimes happens around Buffalo in the spring , the storm developed into a blizzard . We slithered along the highway . <p> " Have to shift her into second now , " my father said , double-clutching . Things grew worse . The snow was falling so heavily and wetly that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at a dark gray wall . <p> " Good night , nurse ! What are we going to do now ? " my mother said . <p> " Les , " my father said , " you 'll get up on that hood and keep those wipers clear . " <p> I did . By the time we reached Lackawanna , where the streetlights were lit and snowplows were working , I was frozen solid . But a Buffalo kid is frozen half the year anyhow ; a little hot tomato soup thawed me out . <p> A lot of things connected with the Pierce seemed to happen on Sundays . It was on a Sunday that Mama and the girls really thought they 'd got rid of the dragon-eyed car for good . <p> We went to Polonsky 's restaurant for dinner on Sundays . Our favorite waitress there was called Honey . She had a mop of frizzled , peroxide hair . My father kidded her a lot to make her giggle . He would wait until the whole tremendous meal was finished and we were leaving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Honey , how about bringing me a nice bowl of soup ? " She would die laughing . <p> This one particular Sunday , right after the soup joke , we got into the Pierce , which was right out front alongside the trolley tracks . <p> My father fired her up , ground her into low , and gave his cold-weather signal : one gloved finger sticking out of the barely opened window . We began to pull out . <p> " Watch out for the streetcar ! " my mother said . <p> " We 've got the right of way ! " my father said . <p> The thing I remember most about the wreck was my astonishment at how much wood there was under the aluminum . It was all over the street . We were unhurt , but shaking like Jewish leaves . <p> " I 'll take care of the boy , " someone said . It was Honey . She took me into the ladies ' room to put cold water on my face . I hoped none of the kids would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone , " my father ordered . " I 'm going to phone Bill Brock . " He left to call his lawyer . <p> Well , Bill Brock handled the streetcar company all right , and , to my mother 's anguish , the Pierce looked as good as new in three weeks . <p> " You ca n't kill the heart of a well-made machine , " my father said . <p> As I reached adolescence , the Pierce got new piston rings and I got pimples . A lot of my friends had them , but I really hated mine . I determined to do something about them . I decided that a pimple was nothing more or less than some foreign substance under the skin . If you could get that right out of there , the pimple then had no reason to exist and would go away . <p> The Pierce had a vacuum-operated windshield wiper . When the engine was running , you could slip the rubber hose off and actually feel that strong suction . If you put a lighted cigarette in the hose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your eyes ; my friend Calver Oakes and I did it quite often . <p> Here was the answer to my skin problem . I got hold of a glass straw and waited for a good pimple to show up . Sure enough , one did , right on the nose . But Calver and I were n't going to rush things . We held the glass straw under the hot-water spigot until we were sure it was sterile . Then we went out to the Pierce , put the unsanitary end of the glass straw on the hose and the sanitary end on my nose . Then I started the engine and stepped on the gas . It drew nicely . <p> " Take your foot off the gas , " Calver said . " You 'll get more vacuum . " I did . The suction was fantastic . The tube became an angry little leech trying to inhale my skin . I heard a soft pop and watched a piece of nose go up the straw . Calver had the sense to turn the ignition off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face . <p> " That car is a curse , " my mother muttered . <p> How nice it would be to be able to say that the Pierce became my first " dating " car , to be able to tell of long moonlit rides along Lake Erie , with my arm around Ralpha Becker or Irene Egbert , or even Claire Hochgrebe . But the Pierce left our family before I reached that stage of development . <p> Like many terrible things happening then , it was because of Hitler . War was getting close in Europe . The price of aluminum soared . <p> The car was stolen on a Thursday night while my father was having a sweat and a rubdown at the Montefiore Club . The police thought the thief must have followed him for a couple of weeks to learn his habits . <p> No crime ever precipitated more phone calls . There were calls without letup : calls to detectives , desk sergeants , judges , and even to the Chief of Police . <p> Just before dawn Friday , an incoming call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our pajamas , listening . The Pierce had been found in the woods , stripped of her aluminum . <p> " No , " my father said quietly , " no , no , I do n't want to look at it . " He hung up , and we all went to bed . <p> We never really knew for certain , but for as long as she lived , my mother stuck to the story that she had won $50 at the Fort Erie track and had given it to two men for them to steal the Pierce-Arrow . <p>
