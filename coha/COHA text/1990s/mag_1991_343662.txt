Fighting back is a decidedly unaccustomed role for IBM . Other companies have to do it all the time , of course , but the Colossus of Armonk ( N.Y. ) is different . Overwhelmingly dominant in its industry for decades , IBM is used to swatting aside small rivals  --  and they 're all small by comparison  --  with a brush of its hand . Now things have changed . <P> Last week was worse than most . With AT &T; acquiring the computer maker NCR ( for $7.4 billion ) , what had been little more than a bothersome competitor was suddenly part of a company as big as IBM . A new survey of customer satisfaction among business users of personal computers showed IBM out of the running , somewhere below 10th place and below average , its exact ranking not disclosed by the pollsters . Its stock is skidding along near a nine-month low . And at week 's end , to underscore that the company is going through one of its toughest times in memory , it informed more than 10,000 employees that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early July . Big Blue remains fearsomely strong ( 1990 revenues : $69 billion ) , but the days of Pax IBM may be over . <P> How could it happen ? After all , the millions of Americans who have bought IBM stock or joined the company as employees were betting on a leviathan , a creature so big it could n't be threatened . The answer is that while no killer shark is out there attacking this whale , thousands of relentless barracuda are taking bites out of it . Once the pre-eminent force in closet-size mainframe computers , IBM has watched its share of the world market dwindle from nearly 80% to 69% , as rivals like Japan 's Fujitsu and Germany 's Siemens score large gains with more powerful and less expensive machines . Its once commanding lead in personal computers has shriveled from 46% to 23% . Big Blue has stumbled so badly in such markets as home computers , portables and telecommunications that security analysts have started to doubt the company 's high-tech superiority . <P> IBM has even lost favor with investors , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . True , the figure was mainly an accounting phenomenon , but its cause was far from heartening : The company was taking a $2.3 billion charge for the full estimated costs of paying 10,000 employees to quit voluntarily in the coming year . At its annual meeting last month , chairman John Akers told stockholders to brace for more bad news : " While we 'd like to believe economic recovery is just around the corner , we have seen no evidence yet to indicate any improvement , and consequently the year remains uncertain . " The IBM empire is striking back . In a marketing effort unparalleled in its 80-year history , the company launched an all-out offensive to retain current markets and recapture lost turf . The past 11 months have brought virtually nonstop announcements of new products , including a laptop computer , a home computer and a line of midrange computers costing an average of $500,000.
