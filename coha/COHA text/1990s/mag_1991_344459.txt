The record had stood unapproachably majestic for 23 years , a distance of 29 ft. 2 1/2 in. , about the length of a medium-size truck , easily traversed by a motorcycle daredevil propelled off a ramp  --  but not by unaided tendon , sinew , flesh and blood . Only a few dared to challenge the long-jump record  --  the oldest and most awesome in track and field  --  set in 1968 when the American Bob Beamon flung himself through the thin Olympic air of high-altitude Mexico City , spanning a gap no man had crossed before . <P> Many experts thought the record a fluke , unlikely to be repeated . At 7,347 ft. above sea level , Mexico City was perfect for a leap into history , but just ! that once . The Red Sea parts only under extremely specific cosmic circumstances . Beamon never got close to his record again , nor did he quite figure out how he did it . All others who tried failed . Until last week . <P> No , Carl Lewis did n't do it . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lewis was it . He is the king of track and field . Earlier last week Lewis proved he could still be the fastest human alive , when he set a new world record of 9.86 sec. to take the 100-m gold medal at the World Track and Field Championships in Tokyo . And even though the muggy , sea-level Japanese capital was hardly ideal for breaking the long-jump record , Lewis was going to try . In an astonishing series , he turned in the greatest sequence of long jumps ever recorded . No one had ever soared so far and so consistently over six tries , all well past 28 ft. , brushing against the record . At one point , Lewis actually crossed Beamon 's mark , going 29 ft. 2 3/4 in . But judges ruled that it had been wind aided and did n't count . Lewis wanted the record . He often spoke as if it were just around the corner ; he stretched out for it expectantly . But destiny would offer it to someone else . <P> Limbering up in Lewis ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had chafed under the superstar 's decade-long domination of track and field . Powell 's first four tries were less than Carolingian . " Something went wrong on every jump , " he said . But the fifth came with a veritable thunderclap . Powell flew up against a sky heavy with humidity and threatening summer clouds . When he came down , he felt something had happened . " I knew it was far , and I knew it was close to Carl 's . When I looked at it , I thought it might be a world record . " It was . He had broken Beamon 's unmatchable mark by a full 2 in . The 60,000 spectators at Tokyo 's National Stadium were on their feet , cheering . From the sidelines the eclipsed Lewis watched Powell claim victory , brushed off tears and walked away . <P> Back in the U.S. , Beamon , who runs a youth sports program in Florida , expressed surprise . Said he : " I was thrown off by not hearing the other name  --  Carl Lewis , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Only a Beamon-busting jump could have overshadowed Lewis ' achievements last week . At 30 , an age when athletes are often limping into retirement , Lewis is still capable of setting new records , as the 100-m dash proved . After winning the race , he said , " The great thing was , the old man was able to pull it out . "
