Come to think of it , Paul knows tomatoes a whole lot better . Since 1946 , he 's been growing them in his small backyard garden in Kosciusko , Mississippi . And he 's become very , very good at it . Some of his plants top 20 feet tall . He picks the first tomatoes by about mid-May . His three-dozen plants bear more than 700 pounds of fruit a year . Obviously , Paul really likes tomatoes . If you like them , too , and want to harvest more than you can stuff in a futon , read on . Paul is about to reveal his secrets . SECRET TOMATO FORMULA FINALLY EXPOSED ! * Choose the right ones . " The same kind of tomato wo n't grow good for everybody , " says Paul . So choose selections that do well in your area . He grows Burpee 's Early Pick for an early harvest ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For really early tomatoes , start really early . Paul sows seeds for his earliest fruiting tomatoes in a small greenhouse during the first week of January . ( The last frost usually occurs around April 20 . ) By February 22 , he sows his main crop and transplants the early seedlings to his cold frame . The cold frame runs north-south ; sheets of black plastic along its back gather solar warmth . A removable top and front let Paul adjust the temperature inside . On cold winter days , an electric heating coil warms the soil . Paul turns it on two to three weeks before planting . In mid-March , he pots up his mainseason plants . He places them in the cold frame behind the earlier plants , until the weather 's warm enough for the later transplants to go into the beds. * Good soil is key . Paul 's original soil was hard clay . Now it 's as soft as cake mix . Paul made it this way by tilling in about a half-ton of compost a year . His compost comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fills with leaves . Each fall he gathers the leaves from the neighborhood and runs them through a shredder . Sprinkling a handful of nitrogen fertilizer atop each layer of leaves speeds decomposition . * Plant ' em right . Paul advises setting the plants into the ground so that only the top set of leaves are showing . The plants will root along their buried stems , making them vigorous and drought tolerant . Some folks prefer digging a deep hole ; others like laying the plant sideways in a shallow trench . Paul says deep holes work better in dry years , shallow trenches in wet years . * Feed the hungry . Growing tomatoes need lots of food . Before planting his main crop , Paul digs a foot-deep furrow for each row , sprinkles a good amount of cottonseed meal down the middle , and tills it in . He spreads an inch or two of compost around each tomato at planting . During the growing season , he sprinkles about a halfpound of 5-20-20 fertilizer beside each 35-foot row .
