Readers of TIME have long been familiar with Robert Hughes ' provocative , elegantly expressed art reviews . But the art world has never been enough to hold Hughes ; he is one of the magazine 's true Renaissance men . In 1987 he published The Fatal Shore , a best-selling , critically acclaimed history of the settling of his native Australia . Next month Knopf will bring out Barcelona , his account of the social and cultural history of the Spanish city . In the pages of TIME , Hughes has had his say on everything from motorcycling to gun control . <P> Hughes ' essay this week , The Fraying of America , is adapted from his lecture series at the New York Public Library titled " The Culture of Complaint , " to be published later this year by Oxford University Press . The lectures were inspired by his unhappiness at efforts to remake U.S. school curriculums along politically correct lines . " What angers me is the herd instinct that leads people to suppose that European culture is the fount of all evils in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe it is . " <P> TIME editors have grown accustomed to Bob 's forceful opinions and iconoclastic ways . The magazine hired him in 1970 , when he was a free-lance art critic living in London . Senior editor Christopher Porterfield , then our London bureau cultural correspondent , recalls that Hughes expressed two concerns about going to work for TIME . " He wanted to know if he would have to cut his shoulder-length hair , " says Porterfield , " and whether he would have to give up his motorcycle . " <P> The hair has been tamed ( Bob 's choice ) , but not his restless energy . Hughes , 53 , divides his time between a loft in downtown Manhattan and a house on Shelter Island , off New York 's Long Island . In between his books and art criticism , he enjoys such hobbies as carpentry and deep-sea fishing . Though he has by no means become bored with the art scene ( his next book will be on the painter Goya ) , Hughes admits a growing passion for history and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the real world interests me more than the art world . " Happily , writing for TIME gives him an opportunity to keep an eye on both .
