pencil . Everybody freaked . Then eight pigs rushed in and beat the crap out of us . I got put into The Coat . I hate being put into that thing . You ca n't breathe . It smells like piss and shit . Though I could n't move a muscle , I kept on screaming until they stuck a needle into my neck . Then I blacked out . <p> For the next few days I said nothing to nobody . Just sat in my cell and stared at the wall in front of me . Vomit-green . I was told my mom came to visit while I was in that state , but I do n't remember . They told me I talked gibberish while she was here . Maybe . But I do n't trust anything they say . Not after what I 've seen them do to Pomo , and the others . <p> I 've got to get out of here . <p> I got sent here by my mother and my shrink . I was mutilating myself , and had suicidal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm seventeen , a minor girl . <p> We go to daily group therapy sessions in the Bubble Room to work on our " issues . " Sometimes we just talk . Sometimes we just jerk off . And sometimes they give us number two pencils to fill in bubbles . The bubbles are possible answers to questions we 've been given . Questions like , " If you were an animal , which of the following would you be ? " or " In a garden , do you see yourself as a flower or a bee ? " Asshole questions like that . But after Pomo 's act , they do n't give us questions that require pencils anymore . <p> Therapy sessions are bullshit . They just want to control you . That 's what this place is all about . The only time the sessions are any good is when others say what they want , or just let you zone . But every time things start getting good , they send for the pigs . <p> They do n't like Pomo . They do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take their crap . And when they try and shut him up , he fights back . Once they told him to shut up , and he got up quietly , walked over to the wall , and peed . They do n't like Pomo . They do n't like you having boyfriends in here . But they 'll never separate us . <p> Thursday 's session was different . It was about triggers . The head shrink , Dr. Norads ( Dr. Gonads to us ) , explained that triggers are things that happen just before you start using . It can be anything . Smell , an overheard conversation , a face , an old movie . <p> We were in a circle . The guy sitting next to me , an older guy named Fast , told how he got on speed . Pomo laughed . He said , " That 's a great title . How Fast got up to Speed . " <p> Fast was a Vietnam vet and during the war worked as a " tunnel rat . " He and some other rats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hospital and ammo dump . It smelled to him of chlorine " like there was a hot tub nearby . " Below they found three " VC nurses " and raped them . When they were done , they jammed hand flares up them , watched their eyes bleed and bellies bloat to incredible size , then explode . After , they set fuses and blew up the tunnel . He 'd never used speed before that day , and got hooked on it because he was afraid to dream at night after the incident . Now every time he smells chlorine or sees pictures of tunnels he wants to use . Today , he told us , he ca n't go underground or in a subway , or go through a long tunnel on the highway . One time , in a taxi , he got caught in a traffic jam in the Callahan Tunnel in Boston and freaked . He started screaming , then foaming at the mouth . They had to bring an ambulance to get him out of there . He almost died . <p> Fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The guy sitting next to him , Bobby Wayne ( I asked him his last name during orientation and he said , " Something or Other " ) , kept saying " Christ Christ Christ Christ Christ Christ Christ " the whole time he spoke . <p> We all had to give our triggers that day . By the end of the session , we were jumping out of our skins . <p> Last night Bobby Wayne Something or Other got matches from somewhere and torched his Bible . The Bible caught his bed on fire . Smoke alarms woke us . We were led into corridors and down exits smelling of burnt linoleum . Fire trucks came moaning into the street where we stood . Everyone stared at smoke pouring out of a third-story window . A patient standing next to me , named Church Ortiz , said , " Last night I turned into a very large black woman . " <p> Bobby Wayne was strapped onto a stretcher and placed in the back of an ambulance with three men dressed in whites . He was saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not what they do . " <p> The next day I got transferred to the adolescent psych ward . Everyone there was my age or younger . Unlike my old ward , there were no great stories by Vietnam vets . We sat in circles as before , but no one spoke . Unlike the other place , they were shy here . After a time , I liked the silence . I never spoke in the Bubble Room . Now they leave me alone . Pomo was n't moved with me , although he 's around my age . I miss him every day . <p> I miss a lot of people . My friends mostly . I 'm not allowed any visitors but my mom , and I do n't want to see her . She 's the reason I 'm here . <p> Since I moved here I 've had this regular dream . I 'm in a car with friends from my old neighborhood . Though I quit my last year , we 're going to our high school reunion . They drop me off at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the marquee , there 's an explosion at the end of the street , at the top of a building . We look . There is one of those enclosed walkways connecting buildings . There is fire and smoke . Large glass windows explode and shatter into pieces and fall into the street . Bodies tumble out , their fall broken by a mass of crossed electrical wires that are somehow strung across the street at each story . Three of the bodies , young males , land on their feet like cats and stumble toward our car . They are badly burned . One of them says , " I did n't want to hurt this way . " They approach us , then collapse in the street . Their lifeless bodies sprawl around the car . Just then , out of nowhere , cops arrive and begin dragging the bodies away . As he drags a charred , smoking victim onto the sidewalk , a cop turns to me and says with a faint smile , " This is a liar , young lady . " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three days . And five weeks in the other ward . <p> I 've got to get out of here . <p> On Monday they took us outside . Since I 've been no trouble they promoted me to Level III , and you get to go on outings . They took us to Harvard Square in a hospital van , fed us at Au Bon Pain , and shepherded us around the Square with no clear direction . People stared at us like we were retards from a group home . We walked past the T-stop , and I looked down into the Pit to see if any of my old buddies were there smoking a butt , but it was still morning , too early for any of them to show . <p> Later , however , as we rounded Nini 's Corner , I felt a tap on my shoulder and turned . It was one of my Pit buddies , Tania . <p> " Where the fuck you been ? " she said . <p> Tania had a nose ring , an eye ring , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was going to get a ring on her tongue . She helped me put in my nose ring , and another into my navel . I was into body piercings . I cut an anarchy symbol into my arm . I wrote a paper on it at school . I cut some more . I watched myself bleed . That 's when they hauled me away . <p> " Been locked up , " I said . I pointed at the group . " With them . " <p> " What the hell for ? " <p> " For being bad , " I said . I thought my face formed a smile , but was unsure . <p> " Being bad at what ? " <p> " At life . " <p> " Wan na go over to Hector 's ? " <p> I looked around me and saw that our group leader , Serge , and others were absorbed in the magazines at the newsstand . No one was watching me . <p> " Yeah , " I said . " Let 's go . " <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but nobody was home . I bought us snow cones with some of the pocket money given me by the hospital . We walked to the Charles River and sat on the cement railing of the bridge . We watched crew teams glide across the water . They moved so gracefully . That was the way I wanted to pass through life . Gliding along , nothing touching me . <p> " They look like insects , " Tania said , tossing her paper cone into the water below . " Centipedes on skates . " <p> It was dark when we got to Hector 's . Hector Perez lived with Ruben Lopez and Dan Villanueva . They were all home . I did n't know Hector well , only met him a couple of times . He 'd been one of my suppliers . I did n't know his roommates and had never been to his apartment . He lived on the third floor of this building just off Mass . Ave . <p> Just as we arrived , Dan and Ruben were going out to buy some Rastafarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three dollars and some change , to put into the pool . Tania had said they had Toad Slime , but all they really had were ludes and some peyote . I took some ludes , washing them down with Southern Comfort . Later , when they returned with the pot , I smoked a few joints . Hector put on 2 Live Crew , and we all tried to dance rap . Everyone bounced as if shook by invisible hands . I did n't know if I was moving right ; I just raised my knees as high as I could , and brought them down . I felt like I was marching in place . <p> After a while , I saw Tania go into the bedroom with Hector and Dan . I went into the kitchen . I leaned over the sink and hurled my guts out . Ruben stood beside me the whole time . With one hand he rubbed my back in a circular motion ; he kept saying , " There there there there there there . " When I was done , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sink . It was solid and held together . He said , " Whaddya say I cook this , and we freebase the fumes ? " <p> When we got back in the living room , Ruben changed CDs and put on Seal . <p> " For mood , " he said . " We can scat . " <p> I sat in a sofa chair clutching my stomach . I could hear moaning coming from the bedroom . " I got ta go , " I said . <p> But Ruben grabbed my arms and pulled me out of the chair . " Dance w'me , dance w'me , " he said . <p> He pressed hard against me , and cupping his hands around my ass , lifted me off the floor , carrying me backward . It seemed I was airborne a long time . When I came down , he had backed me against the air conditioner . It was like deja vu . I was in the past , a time traveler . <p> " You give head ? " he said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to think of where that was . His breath and body smothered me . I could n't move or breathe . I was sick . <p> With one hand on my chest , he pinned me while he fumbled with his fly . He got his cock out and held it in his hand . It was small and limp . He shook it , and the more he shook it , the angrier he got . He said , " C'm on c'm on c'm on c'm on . " It looked like a fat dead worm . <p> Finally , he let go of it and shouted , " Eat my balls , you little fucking cunt . " <p> He raised the hand that had held the worm and made a fist . <p> I felt myself falling sideways before I felt the hurt on my jaw . The word " dive-bomber " came into my head . <p> " You must have blacked out , " Tania said . <p> When she found me the next morning , I was lying on the floor , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck hurt from lying that way all night . My head throbbed . There was blood . <p> " You 've been bleeding , " Tania said . " Your lip 's cut . Your shirt has blood from it . What happened to you ? " <p> " I fell , " I said , getting up . I went into the bathroom and wiped my lip with a washcloth . There was nothing I could do about the shirt . I found some Darvon in the cabinet and swallowed a couple with water . <p> Tania followed me into the bathroom . " Did that pig hit you ? " <p> " We had a fight , " I said . " He said he was sorry , though . " Lying came naturally to me . I did it without thinking whether I 'd be believed or not . <p> " Do n't take their shit , Leila , " she said . " You do n't have to . " <p> " Where is everybody ? " <p> " Gone , " Tania said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the place to ourselves . " <p> " I want to go . " Right then , I really missed Pomo . <p> " Do you want to go to Cafe What ? " she said . " We can stop at my place and get you another shirt . " <p> I shrugged . " Okay . " <p> Somehow , along the way , we never stopped at Tania 's to get a shirt . We got on the subway and rode to Boston , getting off near Newbury Street . Tania had money for tokens . It turned out Tania had lots of money . If she did n't have money , she 'd always get it . She either stole or fucked for it . Most times she had more money than anyone I knew . <p> The sky was low with clouds the color of bruises . We hung out for a while in Copley Square and bought reefers from some wiggers , before going down to Condom World . Tania was always buying condoms . Blue and red and green and transparent ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use one . I think she just liked having them . <p> When we came out of Condom World we ran into Mike Streeter . He looked almost the same . Still had the goatee beard and ponytail , but something was different . I did n't notice it at first , until Tania whispered to me as we started up the street with him , that the top of his right ear was missing . He still wore his ring there , though I thought this would only call attention to it . <p> " We 're going to Cafe What ? , " Tania said . " You want to come ? " <p> " Yeah , " he said . " Yeah , I could use a drink . What do they have on draft there ? " <p> " They do n't sell liquor , " Tania told him . " It 's just a coffeehouse . " <p> " Hah ! " he said . " Like hell they do n't . " <p> " They really do n't , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minors . " <p> " Do n't fool yourself , " he said , and gave a knowing laugh and wink . " Bread gets buttered . It 's business . " <p> Cafe What ? was crowded . Tania and I ordered first . I got lemon water and pita bread , and she got an espresso . We told Mike we 'd save him a place at our table . We got one nearby the counter . Close enough to watch him order . " This I got ta hear , " Tania said . <p> " What do you have on draft ? " he asked . <p> " I 'm sorry , but we do n't serve beer , sir , " the woman behind the counter said . <p> " C'm on , " he said . " Do n't give me that . " <p> " I 'm serious , " she said . " We do n't serve beer . This is a coffeehouse . " <p> " I 'm supposed to believe everyone in here 's drinking coffee . " <p> " Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rum and cola . " <p> " We do n't serve anything alcoholic , " she said . " We do n't have a liquor license . " <p> " C'm on , " he said , and removed a bill from his pocket . He held it between his fingers and waved it in her face . " Bread gets buttered . It 's business , " he said , and laughed . <p> " I 'm sorry , sir . " <p> " C'm on , " he said . " C'm on , you 're not gon na pull that holier-than-thou crap . You 're not gon na pull that crap on me now . " <p> " Sir , there are people waiting in line to order . " <p> He hit the counter with his fist . <p> " Okay , goddamn it , " he said . " Give me a goddamn coffee . Black . " <p> " Colombian ? " <p> " Black ! " <p> Mike got his coffee and walked past us . He went into the corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ignored her . He sipped his coffee and stared down at the table . <p> Tania leaned across our table , her hand cupped to the side of her mouth . She said , " What an asshole , right ? " <p> In the past I came here a lot . I fell in love with a guitar player who played every Tuesday and Thursday . I had it bad for him . I came every day , even on days he did n't play , hoping he might show up anyway . Lemon water and pita bread cost only thirty cents , and you could sit all day . He had a girlfriend , though . She had these nifty tattoos and a nose ring . She played in a band with him , but they , I found out , seldom worked . I got a nose ring and phony paste-on tattoos and sat up front , as close as I could . He always said , " Thank you , " and bowed his head when I dropped change into his cup at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a couple of months , he left and went home to Pittsburgh , a waitress told me . I never saw him again . <p> " What 're you gon na do when you graduate ? " Tania said . <p> " I do n't know , " I said . The question had no meaning . Though it was just a few months , it seemed ages since I sat in a classroom . I doubted I 'd ever go back . I was on the run . But even in school , I never thought about the future . I took each day as it came . <p> " Dontcha ever think what you might want to do ? " <p> " Yeah , " I said . " Sometimes . " Once I had thoughts about getting into acupuncture . Holistic medicine . But I had no idea how to go about it . I did n't even know if I 'd like it . <p> " I 'd open a store , " Tania said . " Selling bonsai trees . With everything going Eastern these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Totally , " someone said at the next table . <p> " Really , " Tania said . " You could do a whole lot worse . " <p> I suddenly felt empty . Hollow . I needed to take something . My head still hurt . I was all red inside . I had the shakes . At any moment I believed something awful was going to happen . I could feel it coming . If I closed my eyes then , I could have seen it . I had to get out of there . But I could n't move . <p> " Let 's get out of here , " I said . <p> Just then screams erupted . Mike Streeter stood wielding a knife . He had stabbed a woman seated near him , and was lurching forward , stabbing fleeing patrons as he moved . Some men rushed up and tried to take the knife from him , but he slashed them . He then changed to that slashing motion , cutting anyone he could reach . Both arms moved violently . He looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrambling away from him . A body , a young girl , crashed into our table and toppled it . Tania and I were knocked to the floor . There were more shouts and screams . Mike was suddenly above us . His eyes looked swollen . Tania cursed him . He bent over and slashed her arm , then stabbed my leg . Tania screamed . I stared at my leg and watched a circle of blood form and expand . My mouth opened , but nothing came out . I looked up . I saw him stab another woman , an employee of the cafe , in the chest , and bolt out the door . <p> With others , I was taken to the hospital in an ambulance . En route , I passed out several times . I was told that the knife had cut a major artery in my leg . Tania rode with me . She kept saying , " You 're gon na make it . " <p> I passed out again as I was wheeled into the hospital , and when I woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my leg bandaged . I was in a room with four other patients . <p> Dr. Gonads was there . He wore a smile on his face . It was the same smile he gave when someone in the group started crying . He meant it to show sympathy , but it looked ghoulish . <p> My mother was there , too . She stood beside my bed , twisting her hands , her face contorted as if fighting back tears . She said , " Why ? Why , Leila ? " <p> I stared at a mobile of a moon and stars hanging from the ceiling . <p> Dr. Gonads spoke to her . He said I was in denial . That I ran away to get revenge and stay in denial . <p> As he spoke I closed my eyes . I could see myself start to move . Slowly at first . I made a figure eight . Then I glided forward , balancing on one leg , then two . Then many . I accelerated . I felt the wind brush past my body hairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past them . <p> <p> By John Robinson <p>
