By Verlyn Klinkenborg . From Fathers and Sons , a collection of essays edited by David Seybold , published this month by Grove Weidenfeld . Klinkenborg , whose most recent work is The Last Fine Time , wrote " Back to Love Canal " in the March 1991 issue of Harper 's Magazine . In recent years I have written several essays in which my father played a part . They were allusive , as essays tend to be , and each one seemed to catch the feeling I was after at the time I wrote it . But even good work begins to drift away the moment it is done . Sooner or later every writer reaches the point where his words feel like a shroud . He begins to wish he could brush them away and step into the present , into the open , as himself . But to write is to commit words to the past , to build with bricks that finally conceal the writer , though the wall remains for anyone to see . My father , at sixty-five , is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a language we have worked out for ourselves , a scientific language in which each word stands for one object . When we say " Montana " or " transmission fluid , " weknow what we 're talking about . This tongue evolved in a disputatious time . My mother was our interpreter , and when she died we were left speechless . In the silent period that followed , I think we saw in my mother 's death how much we stood to lose in each other . We have not talked about it . We have no words in our language appropriate to such feelings , though we know a thousand names for " trout lure . " But this is true and I say it for myself : Death makes individuals of us all . The individual it made for me was my father . My father tells a story about a day in his childhood when he and his own father were making hay for neighbors in the northwest corner of Iowa . The terrain there is more exposed than the fields in Iowa 's midlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon meal , and a storm blew up . When they returned to the hayfield , they found one man dead from a lightning strike and three men unconscious . They thought the four were sleeping . This is how the gods gave farmers silence . ? My father tells another story . He and a friend had gone after whitefish in the high lakes of Colorado . The time was just before iceover , when the water turns black with cold . They were harvesting winter fish for the freezer , catching them with grubs on gold-plated hooks . As they fished , they huddled round a fire built onshore . A cowboy rode up on his horse . He dismounted , took a fishing rod from his gear , removed his boots , and wet-waded thigh-deep into the lake . He caught a short stringer of fish , waded back to shore , put on his boots , and rode away . This was one of the gods who gave farmers silence . ? When my father cooks , he is likely to make one of three things : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken dumpling soup , which is a Saturday noon dish ; or venison chili , which is made from last year 's venison burger and carried frozen into camp . The recipe for venison chili he learned in elk camp from an old man who once cooked for Teddy Roosevelt . The trick is whole cloves . My father tells a harvest story from his childhood in the northwest corner of Iowa . He always carried a .410 shotgun on the tractor . When a pheasant fluttered up from the stalks ahead , he would raise the gun to his hip and fire , one hand still on the steering wheel . He is as good a shot from the hip as from the shoulder . I have never seen it proved , but I know better than to doubt it . That is not the kind of thing he exaggerates . My first shotgun was a little .410 with an old-fashioned hammer . What 38 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE / MAY 1992 was missing was the tractor and the cornfield and the birds and the solitude . We moved to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also because in Iowa the hunting had disappeared . ? One night in Tahoe , a famous television actress invited a stranger from the audience to join her act . That was my dad . He cut the rug , sang harmony , danced with his arm around her waist . This is a scene a writer would like to embellish , but not a son . ( The crackle of her clothing , the nimbus of perfume , the sex that seemed so personal from afar but was seen onstage to be a kind of ventriloquism . ) When my father left the farm , he was led away by music . He played the baritone horn , the piano , and sang . Later , he directed . Sundays I would see him , his hack to the congregation , leading the choir with quick movements , the loose sleeves of the robe slipping down to his shoulders . ? In Iowa , if the temperature fell below zero , we could eat fried cornmeal mush for breakfast . When it rose to fifty , we could wear spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to know the temperature . I have never met farm boys who could swim well . They could strike a baseball cruelly , and they could play pinochle . Until I was fourteen , I never saw my uncles without a card table between them . Their silence was not with each other . They had their own boys . There is not a single piece of his own good work that a farmer does with his mouth . Open it and out comes the weather . ? The first time I heard my father swear , the word was " hell . " He said , " What the hell do you think you 're doing ? " I was playing with a friend at the high snowy bank where the railroad tracks passed the graveyard . We had sent my brother home because he was cold . We lived two blocks away , straight back the tracks , two houses in , easy , even for a kid . He had turned up frozen and had ro be soaked in a lukewarm bath . My mother , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told of the sleep that nearly overcame her . As a boy I could picture the yard lights burning across the snow , too far away to reach , too far away to keep her awake . ? The borders of character are permeable . I distrust any man who claims to have had a continuous friendship with his father . How did he get from fourteen to twenty-six ? How well does he know his father , or himself ? The disputatious time for me was the late Sixties . I notice now that it was the one period of my father 's life when he was cut off from the country . We lived in the suburbs of Sacramento , California . We fought over Ronald Reagan , over Janis Joplin . We lived in Iowa when the Beatles first appeared on Ed Sullivan . The whole family watched . The Beatles made a deep bow . There was John Lennon bending over his Rickenbacker guitar . I said , " He looks like Captain Kangaroo , " and the whole family laughed . That laughter has burned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer of 1971 my mother died of leukemia . She was forty-three . She died after a ten-year remission , which she believed God had granted her ? and who will doubt her ? ? so that she might raise her four children to an age of relative safety . I , the oldest , was nineteen when she died , and callow , through no fault of hers , beyond my ability to comprehend it now . My father assembled his children on a bench in the backyard and told us that our mother , his wife , had died in her hospital room earlier that afternoon . Grief scattered us . But before we began to wander wherever our feelings carried us ? we would bump into each other like strangers again and again over the next few hours -- 1 happened to look at my father 's face . It was the face , as I imagine it now , of Adam as he and Eve were led away from the Garden . With this difference : that Eve was the Garden from which my father was led away alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had two bedrooms , one bathroom , and a lawn . When we moved out , it had five bedrooms , three bathrooms , a new hallway , a new kitchen , garden , toolshed , woodshop , patio , child 's fort raised on poles , and a doughboy pool . My father had erected a portable sawmill in the driveway . There was a trailer parked under the plane tree . There were chickens in the garden . At family reunions we pour cement . We do the work ourselves . I remember how modern , how Californian I felt when my dad remarried . We saw the honeymoon couple off at the airport and then we children drove ourselves home . They were bound for Oaxaca . Soon my dad and Sally , his new wife , will have been married for as long as my mother and father were married . Sally was as sadly damaged by death as my father . It is hard to say who saved whom , but both were saved , and the children were , too . ? And yet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's life , when we had not been told what our parents knew . She and my father left the dinner table and walked out through the backyard to a bench beneath the apricot tree . Sometimes they sat and sometimes they walked among the rows of corn and beans just past the grape arbor . Their movements were graceful , slow . Soon the delta breeze carried off the heat of day . We could see them there as we cleared the table , and we did not know what we were looking at . None of us was ever again so blessed by ignorance . ? Now my father is rebuilding his childhood He has an International Harvester tractor , fourteen acres of good pasture grown up in rye grass , a barn , and some cattle . The land is not as flat as it was in Iowa , nor as steep as it was in Colorado . I notice that I am rebuilding my father 's childhood , too . I have some pasture . I can see the use for some of his tools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember the moment when I first realized that I resembled my father . Every son does , There is a spectral flash of recognition . Any woman you know sees the resemblance too plainly . I would like to be discovering now the ways I resemble my mother , too . The borders of character are permeable . When the gods gave farmers silence , they also gave them the power to mean great things by it . Words become a frail chattering on those prairies . As a boy , my father drove a horse team . An ancient metaphor for writing is derived from the movement of a team of oxen . The farmer walks behind them , clucking and singing . Birds hop in their path . The oxen bend to the yoke and in the earth a furrow is turned . The furrow is the line of words on the page . The page is the earth . The writer turns the team homeward . The birds rise into the sky and vanish .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
