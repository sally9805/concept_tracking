<p> Goldman , Sachs &; Company , Wall Street 's last big private investment bank and by many measures its most successful , plans to announce today that it will end the firm 's 130-year partnership by becoming a public company , according to people close to the firm . <p> Goldman 's top executives were still meeting late last night to work out some details of the move , which would make Goldman a prime player in the financial industry 's rush to consolidate . In recent years , that trend has turned nearly all of America 's venerable finance partnerships  --  which each formerly had a distinct culture and investment philosophy  --  into homogenized financial giants . <p> The move would also be an indicator that some of Wall Street 's savviest financiers believe there may never be a better time to capitalize on the bull stock market and on the public 's love of finance houses with global ambitions . <p> Based on the stock-market prices of some other big investment houses , a decision to become a public company by issuing shares of stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion and give each of the partners a stake that might eventually exceed $100 million . <p> Goldman 's six-man executive committee was still meeting late last night to work out an agreement in principle to end the private partnership by selling at least part of the company . People at Goldman said that the firm 's 190 partners , in weekend meetings that they described as passionate , had been almost evenly divided about the merits of ending the private partnership  --  torn between the near-term riches and global heft that would almost certainly follow and the satisfaction of working within a tight-knit group whose decisions are not subject to the whims of outside shareholders . <p> Yet the partners left the final decision in the hands of the firm 's six top executives , knowing full well that most of the executive committee favored the plan to go public . <p> As the firm 's partners and 11,000 employees around the world anxiously awaited the results of the executive committee 's deliberations last night , Jon S. Corzine and Henry M. Paulson Jr. , Goldman 's co-chairmen and chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for early Monday morning . Barring last minute surprises , the two were expected to announce the decision in principle to take the company public , with details to be presented to the full partnership in a month or so . <p> Even though that decision would mark the end of a private firm founded in New York in 1869 by a German Jewish immigrant , Marcus Goldman , the game of musical chairs now played on Wall Street is a global one , and Goldman is determined to keep its seat . It is enjoying record profits , earning about $1 billion in each of the last two quarters . But it does not have stock , the chosen currency for mergers and acquisitions , and is now smaller than its leading rivals . It is also ill-prepared to seize opportunities at a time when walls between brokerage firms , bank and insurance companies are crumbling . <p> As a public company , Goldman bankers say they would seek to buy other American and foreign finance companies . And the firm itself , considered Wall Street 's crown jewel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose stock offerings it underwrites , will likely receive a flood of merger proposals  --  some of which might allow Goldman to take over a larger commercial bank or insurance company . <p> Also underlying the decision is a fear that if the company does not go public during the current bull market , Goldman partners might lose an opportunity to capture the extraordinary value the market now places on well-run securities companies . <p> To some market watchers , Goldman 's decision might be taken as a sign that the partners believe the stock market has reached a high . Indeed , Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns , two rival , first issued shares to the public in 1986 and 1987 , close to the peak of that era 's bull market . <p> Goldman has long engaged in its own version of Hamlet  --  to go public or not to go public  --  deciding half a dozen times , most recently in 1996 , to stay private . But people at the bank say a confluence of factors , including the bull market , the global competitive challenge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best years in banking history , have now tipped the balance in favor of ending the partnership . <p> It was not a clear-cut choice . At their two-day retreat at the Palisades Executive Conference Center north of New York City on the Hudson River , a complex patrolled by security guards , the partners engaged in what was described as a Quaker-style meeting , where all 190 partners were invited to state their views about the firm 's future . <p> In a long open session Saturday morning , more than 100 of them did so , with some later describing this gathering of mostly male white-shoe bankers as emotional and draining . <p> " For people who have devoted their lives to this place it was exhausting , but in some ways amazing , " said one person who attended . " People did not hold anything back . " <p> Mr. Paulson and Mr. Corzine remained officially neutral through the discussion , said people who attended . But several top partners who worked with Mr. Paulson to devise a strategic plan made strong cases in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too plodding and cumbersome for a bank with thousands of employees and the need to make snap decisions in scores of countries . <p> Others , including John L. Thornton , a member of the executive committee , spoke with equal determination against any public sale of shares , people there said . The prime fear was that a public company could never replicate the close-knit culture of a partnership , where financial rewards are measured in lifetimes instead of months . <p> In the end , no formal vote was taken . The partners were given a questionnaire in which they were asked to state their views on a public offering and several other issues , each requiring a written answer . Partners left the meeting Saturday afternoon without knowing the results of that poll . Reviewing the comments was left up to the executive committee , which met Sunday and continued discussion over dinner Sunday night . <p> At the weekend retreat , Goldman executives presented several ways of valuing the company , and their estimates covered a wide range of $15 billion to $35 billion , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detailed plan for going public and would not put a price tag on the firm until they do . <p> Some analysts expect that the firm is likely to value itself between $25 billion and $30 billion , considered a rich but not implausible figure given the way the market values other securities companies . But some bankers argue with that figure and say that Goldman , given its reliance on some outside investment capital as well as partners ' capital , would have to settle for less , perhaps $20 billion to $25 billion . <p> How the firm spreads that wealth is likely to be a matter of discussion in the weeks ahead . But several people within the firm expect that with a possible valuation of $30 billion , existing partners will take between $20 billion to $22 billion , or an average of $105 million to $115 million apiece . Goldman 's 6,000 nonpartner executives would split between $6 billion and $8 billion , this person said . The rest would be reserved for the firm 's outside investors and limited partners . <p> Several at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only about how to stuff the already bulging wallets of top executives . It is also about how to prepare the firm for a new era  --  one in which only the most global banks with the resources to fight for business in any major economy will prosper . Increasingly , these people say , Goldman 's private partnership is a handicap in that race . <p> In particular , a partnership can not compete with public companies in the acquisitions game because it does not have stock , which is often a much cheaper way of acquiring other companies than cash . For that reason Goldman has tended to grow organically or to make only small purchases while some of its rivals have entered giant mergers or made multibillion dollar purchases to expand their business . <p> By some standards , Goldman is the most profitable investment bank in the world , and it competes for the top slot in all of its major businesses . But executives say they can not ignore Merrill Lynch &; Company 's global acquisition binge , Morgan Stanley 's merger with retail broker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed incorporation into a putative banking behemoth called Citigroup . <p> " On any one of these things , we can say , ' Oh , O.K. , we do n't need to do that , ' " says one Goldman executive . " But you put them together , all these little punches , and you start to feel a little uneasy . It weighs on you . " <p> But that straightforward reasoning underestimates the almost cultish attachment to partnership at the firm . It is an anachronistic vestige of 19th century , family-centered company organization , but a gilded one : A Goldman partnership is one of the few ways a Wall Street professional can become independently wealthy , with many earning as much as a top corporate boss or successful private entrepreneur . <p> Yet the firm also maintained a rare balance between fabulous monetary rewards and tight team discipline . One Goldman banker described this as " getting rich slowly . " There are stars in the Goldman system . But they get smaller up-front rewards , and less public recognition , than they might get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldman elevated it to a commandment , bankers there say . Because partners ' own money is at stake in every deal , the firm operates by consensus , with top executives often able to trust other partners implicitly . Scores of Goldman people participate in decisions that one or two bosses might make in other firms . <p> " The teamwork thing is not just propaganda  --  it is emotional and real , " says one person at the firm . " It was really the one thing that made this place special  --  something other banks do n't have . " <p> If Goldman , Sachs goes public , it would be the last major invest-ment bank to do so .
