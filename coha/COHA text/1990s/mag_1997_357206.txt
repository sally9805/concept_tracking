The best way to reach the garden of Eden , I found , was to fly into Kansas City , Mo. , rent a car and drive north on Interstate 35 for two hours , exiting at a town named Cameron and following the signs to Adam-ondi-Ahman . The place was marked on my atlas merely as a " Mormon shrine , " but having grown up as a Mormon , I knew better . According to Joseph Smith , the farm-boy prophet who at 14 felt his first heavenly inklings and by 30 had attracted thousands of followers , this was where God created humankind and where Christ would return to rule the earth . <P> I parked in a lot beside two other cars , both of which had Utah plates , and followed a path to a posted overlook . I had been here before , as a devout 14-year-old on a church-led bus tour . Now , a more skeptical adult , I wanted to follow the Mormon trail again , traveling ( in the order of settlement ) from Missouri , Joseph Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first true Mormon city , then west along the route of exile to Salt Lake City , Utah . Preserving and highlighting the past is a Mormon priority  --  witness the re-enactment of the wagon train . Leaders of the church seem to understand that its vivid history , as much as its sometimes cloudy theology , is what attracts the potential convert . <P> Standing beside a clean-cut young couple dressed rather formally for the summer weather , I looked out over Adam 's home , a broad green valley that is currently planted in corn . Smith planned a town here that never took hold , just one among several Mormon promised lands , from Kirtland , Ohio , to Independence , Mo. , that he and his flock were violently driven from . The public did not like Mormons in those days ( segments of it still do n't ) and charged them with a host of crimes ranging from fraternizing with native " savages " to advocating the abolition of slavery . Smith 's early church was a radical institution . It preached communitarian economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith 's deepest break from orthodoxy had to do with geography , not theology : he taught that the New Jerusalem was here , smack dab in the middle of America . <P> I drove east out of Eden across the Mississippi , reflecting that perhaps Smith 's prophecies were not so wacky after all . Even Mark Twain ( a notorious Mormon mocker who famously dissed the Book of Mormon as " chloroform in print " ) set his own idyllic fables along the riverway . Indeed , if God had planted Eden in America , he could not have found better soil or growing weather . Even the air smells fertile in northern Missouri  --  humid , rich and fertile  --  almost malted.
