Would n't it be great if we all had the wounded wisdom of a fine country thrush ? Singers from Patsy Cline to Patty Loveless have lent their vocal courage and frazzled hearts to plaints about love with the wrong kind of guy . They are what has kept Nashville pulsing through decades of shifting fashion . But the town did n't suit Kelly Willis . After a few albums in the early ' 90s , she split for Austin , Texas . Her new CD , What I Deserve ( Rykodisc ) , puts a sultry Lone Star spin on the country sound . This cowgirl can sing the blues as if she 'd grown up inside them . <P> In the album 's 13 songs ( six of which she wrote or co-wrote ) , Willis has the tone of a roadhouse Everygal . She could be singing her lungs out on the bandstand , swaying dreamily on the dance floor , standing behind the bar with a look of knowing pity . How knowing ? Here are the album 's first lines : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the game you 're playing/ So it 's only just for now/ That I will let you take me down . " In the slow-dance Got a Feelin ' for Ya , she sings about ice cream ( " I 'm in the mood for somethin ' sticky " ) as if it were the raunchiest ranch hand in sight . This is music for grownups on the loose , the prowl and the mend . <P> Her voice has an easy virtuosity . The womanly throatiness can break , like a child 's heart , three or four times in a single syllable . While the lyrics suggest teasing foreplay , the voice is sage , reflective , postcoital . Settling in Texas , Willis found more than her voice ; she found a style to build a sturdy career on . What she deserves is what she gives here : the downhome best . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
