When lane Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice , she was n't writing about a pride of lions , was she ? <p> HE FAMILY OF RADFORD had been long settled in Devonshire . Their estate was large , and their residence was at Selwyn Park , in the center of their property , where , for many generations , they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance . Sir Radford , the present owner of the estate , did , in his habits , somewhat strain the reputation established by his father and his grandfather and his great grandfather before him . Sir Radford had a passion for exotic animals and the wealth to indulge that passion . A widower , he lacked the guiding hand of a wife to temper his eccentricities . On his estate , he kept a menagerie of exotic creatures , brought to him by adventurers and explorers from all parts of the globe . A visitor , riding up the lane toward Sir Radford 's large and handsome house , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh of a wild hyena . Sir Radford 's collection included an Indian tiger , three ostriches from Africa , and an assortment of gaudily colored birds from the jungles of South America , all obtained at great expense . Though Sir Radford 's wife had borne him no children , he shared his home with a young woman whom he had adopted as a daughter . There were those in the county who said that Miss Selina was his natural daughter , born in one of those exotic places where he had so often traveled , and brought home to be raised an Englishwoman . But the story , as Sir Radford told it , was that she was the only daughter of a gentleman in Russia who had been much like a brother to Sir Radford . When that gentleman had met with an unfortunate hunting accident , Sir Radford had taken the man 's daughter as his own . Whatever her ancestry , Miss Selina Radford was a handsome young woman , with black hair and sparkling hazel eyes . Sir Radford had engaged governesses to teach her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pianoforte with considerable skill , and had a lovely singing voice . She was a hearty girl , given to long walks on the downs and vigorous rides . Sir Radford was an exceedingly sociable gentleman . Every year , when spring mists and rain gave way to warmer weather , he invited his elderly cousin , Lady Dustan , to visit his estate . And so , in the spring of 1828 , Lady Dustan came to the estate with a party of young friends . Lady Dustan herself was never happier than when she had a noisy party of young people gathered about her , so that she could watch over them and speculate on how they might best be paired off , as matchmaking was one of her favorite occupations . The first evening at Selwyn Park , while Selina played the pianoforte and the assembled company listened politely , Lady Dustan and Sir Radford sat at the back of the room , where they might converse in lowered voices about the members of Lady Dustan 's party . She had brought her two nieces , Mary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A second young man , William Gordon , had joined the party at Sir Radford 's request . " I think you will enjoy the company of Mr. George Paxton , the son of my dear friend , " said Lady Dustan . " He has spent the past few years in the service of the British Museum doing something frightfully scholarly with plants and animals that are found in rocks . " " Fossils , " Sir Radford ventured . Lady Dustan fluttered her hand as if brushing away an annoying insect . " I suppose . He tried to explain it to me once , but I could make no sense of it . Something about chalk and seashells and dead creatures . He 's left the museum in any case and taken up with the newly established Zoological Society . They 're endeavoring to make a zoological garden in Hyde Park . He 's a sweet-tempered , amiable , young man , though a bit diffident and retiring for his family 's tastes . His mother wished him to go into the law or the army , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks and animals , it seems . Still , I think he has an open and affectionate heart . " " I can understand wanting to putter about with rocks and animals , " Sir Radford commented , with the slightest edge in his voice . " Of course you understand , Sir Radford . But Lady Paxton is quite bewildered by his behavior . " Lady Dustan smiled at the back of George Paxton 's head . " I do believe that he and my niece , Lydia , would make a fine match . Their temperaments would complement one another admirably- she is an excitable girl and I think Mr. Paxton might help make her less prone to extravagance and passion . And she might help him approach life in a livelier manner . She 's an amiable girl , though not terribly handsome . She has 10,000 pounds settled on her , and that would make his family much more willing to indulge his eagerness to study animals , rather than the law . " " I imagine that would make the young man very happy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Lydia 's younger sister , Mary . She 's a lovely girl , though quiet by nature . " Lady Dustan shifted her gaze to William Gordon . He was handsome enough , with a fine dark mustache and a military air . " And what can you tell me of Mr. Gordon ? " " He 's a Navy man . He brought me two fine macaws when he returned from South America . And he says he may bring me a zebra when next he voyages to Africa . " " What of his character ? " " A steady man on a hunt , I can say that . He 's a capital fellow , I think . " Lady Dustan shook her head , dismayed by Sir Radford 's lack of useful information on the young man . Before she could inquire further or ask discreetly about Selina 's prospects , Selina 's song came to an end and Lady Dustan and Sir Radford joined in the polite applause . As the party moved off to the dining room , Lady Dustan continued to watch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your skill in playing is matched only by your beautiful voice , " William was saying . " I 've never heard better - not even in the finest salons in London . " Lady Dustan smiled . He flattered Selina unduly - her playing was adequate and her voice was quite pretty , but no more than that . She noticed that William took care to seat himself between Selina and Lydia . At dinner , Sir Radford told them about his latest acquisition - a female elephant , purchased from a circus menagerie that had fallen on hard times . William had a few things to say about the unpredictable nature of elephants , information gleaned on his last expedition to Africa . " I saw a stampede of the great beasts , " he said . " They trampled a village with no more trouble than you would take in trampling an anthill . " George tried to break in with some discussion of the plans of the Zoological Society with regard to African animals . They had already obtained an African elephant and they hoped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And perhaps a giraffe , one of those ungainly creatures with the tremendously long necks . Lady Dustan listened to the young men talk . She thought it unfortunate that George 's considered and soft-spoken plans could not match William 's tales of hunting for ferocious lions and visiting savage African villages . Lydia 's eyes were on William . Young women were not inclined to understand the virtues of a quiet and thoughtful husband . After dinner , Sir Radford prevailed upon the others to join him in a game of whist . Mary sweetly begged to be excused so that she might play the pianoforte , Sir Radford 's instrument being so decidedly superior to the one she played at home . And Selina asked if she might listen to the music rather than playing whist , being an indifferent card player at best . William spoke up quickly , offering to keep Selina company . While Sir Radford , Lady Dustan , George , and Lydia played cards , Selina and William chatted quietly in the corner . The music made it impossible for Lady Dustan to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one another 's company . She also observed that George Paxton was oblivious to Lydia 's smiles . The girl was animated in her enthusiasm for the game , her eyes bright with excitement , but George remained stubbornly distracted by the couple in the corner . Later , when Selina and William strolled onto the terrace to take the air , Lady Dustan kept her eye on George , who seemed rather downcast . He suggested a break in the game at that point , but Sir Radford insisted on another hand . Mary had completed a song and the others had just finished their game when Selina and William returned . The young lady was laughing at something William had said , but her laughter lacked the ease of companionable amusement . Lady Dustan detected an edge of strain , a hint of something amiss . " Miss Selina ! " Lady Dustan called . " Where have you and Mr. Gordon been wandering ? " " Only as far as the aviary , " William said . " It is a beautiful night for a stroll . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amuse her so ? " Lady Dustan asked . She regarded the young woman with interest . Selina 's face was flushed ; her eyes unnaturally bright . " Foolish stories , " Selina said . " That is all . " " I was describing a legend I heard among the African savages , " William said . " When the moon is full , they say that some men turn into hyenas and run wild on the savannah . " He smiled , showing his teeth entirely too freely , Lady Dustan thought . " The moon is almost full and the story came to mind when I heard the hyenas laughing in the distance . " " My dear child , " said Lady Dustan . She took Selina 's hand and pressed it in her own . " I 'm sure no civilized people could ever believe in such a thing . " " On the contrary , Lady Dustan , many people have believed in stories that are equally fabulous , " George Paxton said . Though he spoke to the assembled company , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who become beasts go back to antiquity . In ancient Rome , learned men wrote of the tumskin , versipellis , a man who turned into a wolf . The French tell of the same creature , calling him loup garou . " William laughed . " Do you suppose the Zoological Society will have a loup garou in your collection , George ? Would they welcome such a creature ? " George nodded , but his smile was strained . " If you would only bring us one , I would ensure that the creature found a home there . " Lady Dustan felt Selina 's hand tighten on hers and patted the young woman 's shoulder companionably . " Enough of these foolish tales . Play us another song , Mary , and let us leave these men to talk of their unlikely adventures together . " Dutifully , Mary began to play . The next morning , George Paxton woke just after dawn when a peacock screamed under his window . He lay in bed for a moment , trying to recapture his dream . Selina had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confident that he would win her gratitude . George was , as Lady Dustan had observed to Sir Radford , an amiable , open-hearted young man , though too quiet and diffident to do justice to himself . He was enthusiastic when he was engaged in pursuits that interested him , such as the study of natural philosophy . In those pursuits , his understanding was excellent and his scholarly endeavors had been greatly praised by his colleagues at the museum . But he was fitted neither by abilities nor by disposition to answer to the wishes of his family , who longed to see him in a distinguished profession . In company , his tendency was to retire to a quiet corner and observe , rather than speak out and draw the attention of the crowd to his own accomplishments . He was aware of this tendency and regretted his natural shyness , but he could not bring himself to hold forth as William Gordon did . Sunlight shone through his bedroom window , slipping through a small opening between the drapes . As the day was clear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the garden before the rest of the company woke . A peacock-perhaps the same one that had disturbed his slumberstrutted down the path ahead of him , colorful tail trailing in the dust . The path wound past a cage of parrots that greeted him with rude squawks and flapping wings . " Blast you to pieces ! " one bird shrieked . " Blast you to pieces ! " A scarlet macaw watched him with bright and beady eyes and croaked softly , " You 're a bounder , you are . " No doubt Sir Radford had purchased the birds from sailors who had taught them these questionable refrains . Still , it was difficult to ignore the second bird 's quiet insistence and steady gaze . " You 're a bounder , " the bird muttered again . George turned away , fighting the urge to protest that he was not a bounder , but he knew of a bounder in the vicinity . The night before , he had shared a nightcap with William Gordon after the other members of the party had gone to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his walk with Selina in the garden . William seemed smugly confident that Selina was partial to him , saying that he had stolen a kiss from the young lady when they were strolling out by the aviary . George had contained his feelings , listening to William 's cheerful confession without comment but with a sick feeling at heart . He knew the man 's reputation through his connections at the Zoological Society : an officer in the Navy , Gordon often returned from his travels with exotic animals for sale . He spent the money from these sales in a life of idleness and dissipation , riding and hunting and drinking and gambling . George knew that some thought Gordon handsome , but he thought the man had rather a brutish countenance . " Yes , Miss Selina is a beautiful girl , " William said . " And I am certain that Sir Radford will settle a tidy fortune on her at the time of her marriage . " He smiled , showing his teeth , and George thought of the versipellis . In the company , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loup garou to excess passion . Men who lacked control of their baser instincts were most susceptible to this transformation . George shook his head , attempting to banish thoughts of the night before . The morning was beautiful ; the air was fresh and clear  --  until he turned a corner and caught the scent of rotting meat . He found himself looking down a long straight path that ended at a tall wrought iron fence enclosing a section of pasture land . On the far side of the fence , a hyena was prowling . The size of a large mastiff , the hyena was a strange , ungainly animal , with forelegs longer than its hindlegs and a back that sloped downward as a consequence . As George watched , the beast yawned , exposing an impressive assortment of yellowing teeth . Its eyes were bright and alert , but something-perhaps the way that the animal hunched its shoulders and looked up rather than looking honestly forward-gave it a servile and deceptive air . As it paced , the hyena was giving its entire attention to Selina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunshine . She had a sketchpad in her lap and her eyes were on her work . George hesitated , restrained by his natural shyness , then thought to approach quietly , so as not to disturb her . She did not look up as he approached , but when he was still several feet away she spoke . " Good morning , Mr. Paxton . You are abroad very early . Pray move softly , so you do not alarm my subject . " Stopping where he was , George noticed another hyena lounging in a bit of shade near the fence . Ignoring Selina and its companion in the enclosure , the animal was staring in his direction , its ears cocked forward . " My apologies for disturbing you , Miss Selina , " he said . " I did not think anyone else was awake yet . " " I often come walking early , " Selina said . " Dawn is the best time to observe the animals . " She fell silent then , attending to her work . From where he stood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he contented himself with studying her hands , so delicate and pale , handling the pencil with skill and grace . Wishing to see the sketch , he took a step forward , but Selina , as if anticipating his interest , was already closing her sketchbook and looking up at him . " May I look ... " he began , but she waved him off with an air of diffidence . " I am no artist , Mr. Paxton . My renderings are for my own pleasure only . " Though he wished to press the matter , George could think of no way to do so gracefully . As happened so often , he found himself at a loss , not knowing the proper formula of polite flattery that might persuade her . Selina gathered her skirts and stood , holding her sketchpad and pencil . " I doubt the others are awake yet , " she said easily . " Would you care to stroll through the garden ? I am certain we will be back in time for breakfast . " " Yes , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know what to say , as they walked through the garden together . Surely she must think him dull , walking in silence at her side . He knew that William would have been charming her with witticisms , but George could think of nothing clever to say . " Tell me of your experiences with the creatures you have gathered for the Zoological Society , " Selina said . " I was interested in your thoughts on how one should interact with wild animals . I saw you scowling yesterday when Mr. Gordon explained the techniques used by animal trainers . " George frowned again , remember that conversation of the day before . While Sir Radford was showing the company around the gardens , Lydia had stepped rather close to the tiger 's cage . William had guided her away , saying that she must not approach the cage so closely . " I wanted to rub her ears , " Lydia had said petulantly . " She looks so like a giant tabby . " " She may look like a giant house cat , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She is a wild creature and will not tolerate such familiarity . " " I saw a circus trainer rubbing a tiger 's head , " Lydia had said . " A trainer establishes his dominance over the animal and imposes his superior will . If you wish to interact with a wild beast , that is what you must do , " William had explained in a tone that brooked no disagreement . " You must dominate and triumph over the animal 's spirit . You must demonstrate who is master . Though you approach the beast with friendship , do not expect friendship in return . You can expect no such rational response . " " You look so disapproving " Selina said , recalling him from the memory . " Did n't you agree with Mr. Gordon 's analysis ? He has so much experience with wild creatures in Africa . " " Mr. Gordon and I have different feelings on the matter of wild animals . He wishes them to be under his control . I am interested in studying their lives , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to watch them ? " " To meet with them on their own terms , not on mine . Sometimes , that means simply watching them . Sometimes , they allow a closer contact . " George thought of the bull elephant that the Zoological Society had acquired from a circus . When the beast first came to the Society , it was a foul-tempered creature . But after some months of observing the elephant 's behavior , he came to understand the beast better . The elephant disliked harsh , loud voices and was moved to anger by certain aromas - the scent of a particular type of hair oil , the smoke of cigars . When the animal 's former keeper from the circus had come to speak with members of the Zoological Society about the animal 's temperament , he noticed that the man smoked cigars , used hair oil , and spoke in harsh , ungentlemanly tones . When asked the best way to control the animal , the keeper had suggested that they make use of the whip - the animal best understood pain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's prejudices were not irrational , but rather based on experience . Treated cruelly by a keeper , the creature naturally became wary of sounds and scents associated with that man . Hesitantly , George told Selina of his findings . She nodded thoughtfully . " And you disagreed with his suggested treatment of the elephant ? " " To understand a wild creature , you must take the time to watch and wait , " he said . " There is no use in rushing a wild thing . But Mr. Gordon does not wish to understand wild creatures . Rather , he wishes to bring them under his control . " " And you do not wish to control this elephant , " she said . " By what you say , I think you want to be the beast 's friend . " George thought for a moment , knowing that William would be most amused at the thought of being a wild creature 's friend . Then he nodded . " I think that is a fair assessment , Miss Selina . I want to understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis for friendship . " " Why did you frown before you spoke ? " " If Mr. Gordon heard me speak of friendship with an animal , he would be most amused at my expense . Mr. Gordon mistakes kindness as a display of weakness . " She smiled archly . " You understand Mr. Gordon 's responses just as you understand the elephant 's . " George began to protest , but she waved a hand , dismissing his words . They were nearing the house , and George thought it best to let the matter drop . ACK AT THE HOUSE , Lady Dustan was planning the day 's amusements . She greeted Selina and George with a detailed account of what would take place . Under Sir Radford 's guidance , the party would tour the gardens . In the afternoon , they would have an alfresco tea beneath the shade trees near the elephant enclosure , with pigeon pies and cold lamb and wholesome bread and strawberries from Selwyn Park 's own strawberry beds . Following tea , they would return to the house for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such matters , and her plan was carried out with the precision of a military maneuver  --  until midway through tea . The party was relaxing in the shade , conversing about the fine weather . The shade was most refreshing , and Lady Dustan was finding this time the most pleasant part of the day . She observed that William Gordon had found a seat in the midst of the ladies , where he was making every effort to amuse and be agreeable . He appeared to be paying every distinguishing attention to Selina . That young lady met his gallantries with polite smiles , but , Lady Dustan thought , showed him no particular favor . Lady Dustan was disappointed to see that George Paxton stood apart from the other young people , making no effort to attract the ladies " attention away from Mr. Gordon . How could he remain so shy and standoffish when Lydia was so lively and amiable ? She did not understand the man . As she watched him , her gaze was drawn to the object of his attention : the bull elephant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she trotted around the enclosure , keeping his enormous head close by her rump . When the female paused in a corner of the enclosure , he proceeded to sniff her in a most disconcerting manner , running his trunk between the smaller elephant 's hind legs repeatedly , then pausing to trumpet loudly . At the same moment that Mary looked up , Lady Dustan noticed that the bull elephant seemed to have sprouted an additional leg . " The strawberries are lovely , " Mary was saying . Then she stopped , her mouth slightly ajar , as she stared at the bull elephant . Lady Dustan could not avert her eyes from the elephant 's prodigious member , an enormous shaft of flesh that twisted and curled like a snake . " I 'm feeling a bit faint from the heat , " Lady Dustan said . Her throat felt tight and her voice had a choked quality , but she managed to force out the words . " I believe the sun has been too much for me . " Sir Radford , who had been directing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced up with a frown . " The heat ? In this cool shade ? " Then following her gaze , he exclaimed in surprise . For a time , all was in confusion , the strawberries forgotten . Lady Dustan called to the young women to accompany her to the house , as Sir Radford exclaimed about what a rare opportunity this was to observe the mating habits of the elephant , a sight never witnessed in the wild . William Gordon was unperturbed , gazing placidly at the elephant in pursuit of his lady love , but Lady Dustan observed a hot blush color George Paxton 's face . As men crowded toward the fence of the elephant enclosure , the lady elephant retreated , hurrying away from the bull . Like the lady elephant , Lady Dustan believed that retreat was the best option . " Come along , all of you , " she said . " Lydia , Mary , Selina - let us return to the house . " Giggling like a schoolgirl , Lydia gathered her things . Mary continued to gaze at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooed her and her sister in the direction of the house . Lady Dustan walked with Selina , casting a glance over her shoulder at the men and the bull elephant . As they started away , the bull elephant reared up , placing his forelegs on the lady elephant 's back . She shuddered beneath his weight , but stood her ground . " Oh , Lord ! " Lady Dustan breathed , an involuntary exclamation . She could feel the heat of blood rising in her cheeks as she turned away , taking Selina 's arm and leading her toward the house . The blaring trumpeting of the bull elephant echoed through the garden , a noisy reminder of what went on behind them . On the path to the house , Lady Dustan patted her face with a kerchief , feeling warm and agitated . " I would never have thought an elephant could look small , " she murmured softly to Selina , her voice trembling with agitation . " But she looked small beside him . " " That is so , " said Selina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mount her until she stood still for it , and she did that only when she was ready . I have observed that whatever the species , the female has a choice . Sometimes , she accepts a suitor . Sometimes , she does not . " Selina 's voice was dreamy , as if she were talking more to herself than to Lady Dustan . Lady Dustan stared at the young woman , startled by the matter-offact way in which she talked of the bull elephant mounting the female . Selina smiled sweetly . " Pray , Lady Dustan , you will forgive me . I have been learning at Sir Radford 's side for too long . I am a student of animal nature . " Lady Dustan was glad to see the manor house in the distance . " It will be lovely to get away from the dust and the heat , " she observed , not caring to talk further of elephants and their choices . At dinner that evening , George sat just across from Lydia and Mary . Throughout the meal , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into conversation . He answered her queries politely , but his attention was focused on the other end of the table , where William Gordon was chatting with Sir Radford about future additions to the menagerie and how he might assist Sir Radford in obtaining some rare specimens . Though William directed his comments to Sir Radford , it was clear to George that he intended them for Selina 's ears . Every promise he made to Sir Radford spoke well of his own courage , his resourcefulness , his adventurous ways - all designed to win the heart of a young lady . After dinner , Lady Dustan insisted that Mary entertain them with a song at the pianoforte while George and Lydia played whist with her and Sir Radford , allowing George no way to gracefully excuse himself . The game lasted until just before sunset , when George made his escape . With uncharacteristic forcefulness , he insisted that Mary take his place at the table , a request to which she obligingly acquiesced . While the game continued , George left the house to stroll in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for fresh air , after the closeness of the parlor . He had had several glasses of wine with dinner and was feeling a trifle light-headed . He was not searching for Selina , though she had left the manor house just after dinner , saying that she wanted to do some sketching . He was certainly not searching for William , whose absence from the parlor he had noted not long before he set out . The sun was setting and the full moon was rising , casting silver light over the menagerie . In the moonlight , the peacocks that strutted across the lawn were no brighter than English sparrows , their brilliant colors fading to shades of gray in the dim light . The macaws stirred as he strolled past , and one bird called after him - " You 're a bounder , you are ! " By the hyena enclosure , he found Selina 's sketch pad abandoned on the wooden bench . The three hyenas were awake and alert . The largest of the three , the one that Selina had been drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence that confined them , whining in her throat and staring past him , down the path that led to the downs . The other two answered her whines with strange yaps and growls . George Paxton took up the sketchpad , gazing about him . " Miss Selina ? " he called . " Where are you ? " The garden was quiet . In the moonlight , he opened the sketchpad and studied the pencil drawings within . A sketch of the tiger , her eyes glaring through the bars of the cage . A sketch of the hyena lounging in the sun , perhaps the one that Selina had been drawing when he encountered her that morning . Another sketch of the hyena enclosure - the same iron grillwork , the same drooping tree , the same boulder . But the hyena was gone . In place of the beast , in the center of the enclosure , an elderly woman with an air of dissipation and sloth , reclined on a high-backed sofa . Something about the lady-perhaps her toothy smile or the intensity of her gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a shabby fur collar that had markings similar to those on the hyena 's coat . In the carefully penciled shadows behind her , Mr. Paxton could make out another face-a coarse , ill-tempered young man , the old woman 's son , he would guess . He did not like the look of the man , lurking in the shadows and waiting for an opportunity to do ill . A drunkard and a coward , he thought , ready to pick a man 's pocket or slit his throat . George frowned , wondering at Selina 's fancy . Why had she drawn two people in the hyena enclosure and why such unattractive subjects ? Uneasy , George closed the sketchbook and looked around him for other signs of Selina . The hyenas were staring toward the downs . Following their gaze , he saw something white , fluttering on the fence . He stepped closer and found a woman 's dress - Selina 's dress - hanging from the wrought iron . Beside the dress , a delicate chemise , carefully worked with delicate white embroidery , blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of stockings , neatly tucked into the toes of a pair of lady 's shoes . To convince himself he was not imagining things , George touched the chemise , feeling its silky fabric against his hand . What could be happening ? Selina was naked , somewhere in the garden . The thought of it warmed his blood-and chilled him in that same moment . He imagined her graceful limbs , bare and pale in the moonlight . And William Gordon was somewhere nearby . Could William dare take advantage of a young woman of Selina 's station ? Could Selina be so lost to her family , to all propriety , that she would throw herself into the power of a scoundrel ? Surely she could see that William Gordon was not a man to be trusted . George stood frozen by the fence , not knowing what to do , when he heard a low wail in the distance . The wail rose to an eerie shriek - the howling of a hound . Then the hyenas began a hideous cacophony of barks and yelps and yapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over the hyenas " noise , he heard a man 's voice calling desperately for help . The path toward the downs was shaded from the moonlight by trees , a dark and lonely way that led to open pasture land . A group of Gypsies had encamped not far off - George remembered Sir Radford had mentioned them . Perhaps the hound was theirs . Again , the distant howling , barely audible above the eerie wailing of the hyenas . No Gypsy cur could make a sound like that . The howling was that of a wild beast on the hunt . George ran down the dark path , heedless of his own welfare , seeking only to find the danger- whether it took the form of man or beast - and protect Selina from it . In the darkness , he could not see his way . A patch of mud , slippery from the late afternoon showers , caught him unaware . His feet went out from under him . He slipped , he tumbled , he fell headlong into the ditch beside the lane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of English stone . And then he lay very still , unconscious and rescuing no one . The morning found him in the ditch still , eyes blinking as he slowly came to consciousness . His clothes were muddy and tom and wet with dew . His mind was not quite his own , still muddled from the blow to his head . When he lifted a hand to his forehead , it came away sticky with blood . He lifted his head and gazed about him . A shady country lane . The song of birds in the hedge . An ordinary scene , with nothing to frighten a man . His alarm of the night before  --  surely it had been a dream . Selina 's clothes on the fence . The sounds of a savage beast . Surely he had imagined these things . With an effort , he climbed from the ditch and stood for a moment in the lane , staring at the treacherous patch of mud that had caused his precipitous plunge into the ditch . Beside the marks left by his own skidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prints headed out toward the open pasture - the marks left by a man 's boots and the paw prints of a large dog . By the length of the stride , George guessed that the man was running  --  running for his life . In more than one place , the paw prints overlay the boot prints , an indication that the beast followed the man - close at his heels , perhaps . Heading back in the opposite direction , toward the manor house , was a set of human footprints , left by someone walking without shoes . A delicate foot - that of a child or a woman , George thought . He shook his head , attempting to clear away the fog that prevented him from thinking . " Mr. Paxton ! Whatever happened to you ? " George turned toward the house and saw Selina hurrying down the lane , her arms stretched toward him . " I do not know .... " he began . " I can not say .... " As she reached him , her arms held out to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well , " he murmured . " That is all I ask . I thought ... I heard a beast howling in the darkness . I feared you were out on the downs with Mr. Gordon . I was afraid for you . " He glanced at Selina , then felt himself color as he realized that he was suggesting an impropriety on her part . But she continued to regard him steadily . " I wanted to help . But instead I fell in the ditch . " Again , he felt himself color , feeling that she could not help but think him clumsy and undignified in his rescue attempt . " That was very gallant of you , " Selina said softly . " Though your efforts were unnecessary , I thank you for them . Now you must allow me to help you back to the house . " And so the lady he had thought to rescue was the very one who helped him back to the manor house , draping his arm over her shoulders in a most familiar manner and insisting that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddled to appreciate the warmth of her body alongside his at that moment , though later he recalled it with great pleasure . As they approached the manor house , Selina 's calls for assistance were heard by Lydia and Mary , who fetched a manservant to help George inside . As the man helped George , the young women kept pace . They were flushed with excitement , and Lydia was talking so quickly that her words tripped over each other . " Whatever has happened to Mr. Paxton ! Oh , what a morning this is ! We never have any excitement like this at home . " Between Lydia 's exclamations , Mary told George what had happened . " They found poor Mr. Gordon out on the downs , collapsed in exhaustion , his clothes tom and muddy . He had been running all through the night , chased by a wild beast . The men brought him home not minutes ago . " " A beast was chasing Gordon ? " George asked dully . " It must have been a terrible beast , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a brave man and a great hunter . He 's accustomed to lions and tigers and such - I thought that nothing could frighten him . " " He said it was a terrible , fierce wolf , " Lydia said . " With glowing eyes and fangs . Though I 've never heard of such a creature in Devonshire . " George 's bloody arrival added to the confusion at the manor house . William had been carried upstairs only moments before . The physician who had been called to attend to William 's wounds ministered to George as well , cleaning his head wound and advising rest for both men . George slept the morning through . In the middle of the afternoon , he joined the rest of the company for tea . Lady Dustan insisted he sit in a chair by the fire , though the afternoon was warm . By the time he had finished his first cup of tea , he felt he had told his story of the past evening far too many times , and had heard William recount his at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with retelling . He had heard a beast howling and a man shouting . He did not , out of respect for William , say that the man was screaming in terror . ) He ran to help ; he tripped and fell . He did not mention discovering Selina 's clothing - only her sketchpad . William 's story , George observed , improved each time he told it , which Lydia pressed him to do , again and again . The first time William told it , he was as subdued as ever George had seen him , his face pale with the memory of the beast snapping and snarling at his heels as he ran . He had been out for a walk in the light of the full moon when the beast dashed from the bushes , attacking without warning . He had nothing with which to defend himself and no matter how he had tried to circle and return to the house , the creature had cut him off , almost as if it knew of his desire . He had called out for help , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the tale , he recalled more details . He had kicked at the creature , while it snapped at his boots , its eyes glowing in the moonlight , the foam of madness on its lips . " With a stout walking stick , I would have triumphed . " He smiled grimly , inviting his listeners to consider how the beast would have suffered if he had been armed . " But without any weapon , there was little I could do . " By the fifth accounting , William was no longer pale and his story had been embellished with many details . He had taken a tumble down one grassy knoll , but had succeeded ( having learned something of acrobatics from a sailor aboard his ship ) in rolling back to his feet and running on . He had snatched up a handful of dust and cast it into the creature 's eyes , slowing its advance . He had been brave and resourceful  --  though of course he did not say that directly . He left that to Lydia , who exclaimed frequently at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watching . He noticed Selina , on the other side of the room , was doing the same . HE PHYSICIAN had advised George to rest , sit in the sun , and take moderate exercise . The next day , George used that as an excuse to stroll in the menagerie , avoiding company . He was passing by the elephant enclosure when he met William , walking along the path in the opposite direction . George invited William to sit for a time in the shade , hoping to find out more about Selina and how her clothes had come to be hung on the hyena enclosure . With a little encouragement , William provided a complete account of his evening before the beast had appeared . He had gone out for a walk after dinner , in search of Selina . He had come upon her by the hyena enclosure . " She said that she preferred to sit in solitude , " he told George , " but in my experience young women rarely admit their true feelings . I detected an eagerness and an energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not heartfelt . Finally , I acquiesced , saying that I would return to the house alone , and I left her , proceeding down the path toward the house . But I did not go far . As I walked , the full moon rose above the trees and I thought of how the sight of it might awaken romantic thoughts in a young woman 's heart . At that thought , I decided to speak with her again . I was almost to the spot I had left her when the beast emerged from the bushes and set upon me , chasing me down the path , away from the house , snarling and snapping at my heels . " " I must have been moments behind you , " George said . " When I came to the hyena enclosure , Miss Selina was gone , though I found her sketchpad . " He did not mention that he had also found her clothing , a puzzling and indelicate detail that he saw no reason to share with William . " Miss Selina told me that she returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She must have left the hyena enclosure shortly before you arrived . " George nodded , thinking of Selina and the clothing she had abandoned and wondering where she had been . " It was a terrible night , " William said . " The worst of my life . " The next day , the afternoon was bright and clear . George was taking the sun by the tiger cage when Sir Radford came upon him and inquired after his health . When George indicated that he was feeling much recovered , Sir Radford sat on the bench beside him . From her cage , the great tiger lay in a patch of sun , watching the men through narrowed eyes . " And how are you doing , old beast ? " Sir Radford said to the big cat in a conversational tone . The tiger stood and stretched , then strolled over to rub her chin against the bars . Sir Radford reached out and scratched behind the animal 's ear , eliciting a giant rumbling purr . " I brought her back from India myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cub . " George watched the big cat 's eyes close in contented response to Sir Radford 's attentions . " You are doing precisely what Miss Lydia wished to do , " George commented . Sir Radford nodded . " That is so . But I felt it would not have been good to encourage Miss Lydia . " " Of course . Being strong-willed , she would have insisted on trying to do the same . And though the tiger enjoys your attentions , she might not tolerate Miss Lydia 's . It does not pay to force your attentions on a wild beast who does not want them . " From the corner of his eye , George saw Sir Radford cast a considering glance in his direction . For a moment , Sir Radford was silent , then he spoke in a low tone . " I think you understand a good deal more than you let on , Mr. Paxton . That 's an admirable trait in such a young man . " George hesitated , wondering what had encouraged such flattery from Sir Radford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but baffled as to what Sir Radford thought it was that he understood . Sir Radford leaned back on the bench and returned to studying the tiger . " Selina told me of your concern for her well-being . Under the circumstances as you saw them at the time , it was bold of you to try to run to her rescue . " George felt his cheeks grow hot , as he remembered his failure . He did not know what to say and he was puzzled by Sir Radford 's phrasing : " under the circumstances as he saw them at the time . " How was he to understand them differently now ? There was a wild beast on the prowl , William Gordon was in fear of his life , and Selina had left her clothes by the hyena enclosure . How was one to understand such circumstances ? " Of course , being a man of discernment , you have realized now that my daughter did not need rescuing . I 'm glad of that . " Sir Radford clapped him on the shoulder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well pleased that Lady Dustan included you in her party . " " Thank you , Sir Radford , " George said , resolving to ask for an explanation , even though that request would betray his lack of discernment . " I ... " " No , no . Do not say too much , " Sir Radford interrupted , smiling broadly . " Some things are better left unspoken . " Before George could say another word , the old gentleman stood and strode away down the path with great vigor . George shook his head , wondering what it was that Sir Radford had supposed he was about to say and wishing that he possessed the perceptive nature with which that good man credited him . For a time , he sat alone in the sun , where he could think without interruption of all that he had seen and heard . Somehow , Selina had not needed rescuing , though she was naked on the downs . And the reason was one that Sir Radford would rather not speak aloud . Over the last few days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seeking him out . At dinner , she had made quiet conversation with him , while William held forth to Mary and Lydia about his travels on the Dark Continent  --  beginning over the soup with a description of an elephant hunt and ending during dessert with a tale of his narrow escape from angry savages . Selina had ignored William 's tales , obviously preferring to talk with George . He had been struck once again with admiration for both her beauty and her disposition , for she spoke her mind with serenity and confidence on many topics - from the animals in the menagerie to books she had recently read . Talking with her , he could not imagine her being taken in by William 's bluster . But what else could explain her clothes on the fence ? He was puzzling over the matter , making no progress , when he saw Selina coming down the path toward him . " Would you take a turn through the garden ? " she asked him sweetly . He offered the lady his arm . She commented on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the perfect day . They were silent for a time and he cast about for another topic of conversation . " Have you been sketching lately ? " he asked her . She shook her head . " Not so much . With all the alarms and confusions , there has not been time . " " I confess , the other night .... " He hesitated , for he could not remember the other night without blushing for his failure and thinking of her nakedness . " ... I took the liberty of glancing in your sketchbook . I should not have done so , but I could not resist the temptation . I was struck by your skill , by the delicacy of line . I was particularly struck by the woman who bore such a strange and uncanny resemblance to the hyena . " She was smiling . " I was inspired by Mr. Gordon 's tales of Africa . And it struck me - if a woman can become a wolf when the moon is full , perhaps the transformation can proceed in the opposite direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He glanced at her and found her smiling , a sly and playful look in her hazel eyes . He considered her words , remembered Sir Radford 's words , and realized how she might have been naked on the downs but never in danger . " Of course , " he said slowly , then took a deep breath . " Ordinary hyenas . " He found his eyes drawn to her hand-fair and delicate , the hand of a lady , meant for playing the pianoforte and sketching in the garden . He imagined that hand transforming to become the paw of the beast who had left her tracks in the mud . Such a marvel , such a mystery , such a fascinating secret . He lifted his eyes to meet hers . She was smiling . " The hunt in which your father was killed , " he said at last . " I would suppose that was a wolf hunt . " She nodded . " A tragic misunderstanding . Sir Radford went hunting on the night of the full moon , having failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and found himself with the body of his friend . " They walked in silence for a few minutes . George was very aware of the warmth of her hand on his arm . As they strolled along the path toward the hyena enclosure , George heard William 's voice , though he could not make out the words . " Let us turn here , " Selina suggested . " Mr. Gordon is telling Lydia about the animals and I would rather not disturb them . " George followed her lead , quite willing to avoid conversation with William and Lydia . " Mr. Gordon seems to have taken no permanent harm from his night of terror on the downs , " he remarked . " In fact , I think the experience might well improve his character . " " You are an optimistic man , " she said . George hesitated , uncertain of the propriety of what he was about to say , then plunged ahead . " Mr. Gordon seems to feel he knows a great deal about what women want . I suspect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Gordon did not behave toward you as a gentleman should behave toward a lady . " She continued to smile . " He thought that I favored him - but he was not a terribly observant man . A better observer would have noticed the one I truly favored . " George found himself unable to speak . Could she mean that she favored him ? There was nothing else she could mean . " You have nothing to say , Mr. Paxton . " " I have too much to say , " he began . " My heart overflows with more admiration and affection than I can begin to express . " But for all that he said he could not , George continued , telling her of his feelings and avowing his love and admiration in tender words . For days after , the neighborhood could talk of nothing other than the alarms and confusions of that night . A great hunter , pursued by a vicious beast . A young man , injured in his attempts to offer assistance . Both were made out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beast that had pursued William through the moonlit night remained a mystery to the community . The first conjecture - that the animal was an escapee from Sir Radford 's menagerie-proved false , for all of that noble gentleman 's charges were accounted for . The Gypsy band was located and the dogs owned by the band were examined . They were , by all reports , a mangy lot , but none of them seemed large or energetic enough to menace a strong man like William Gordon . Sir Radford led many hunts , as did William Gordon when he had recovered . But no animal answering to William 's description of the beast could be found . Before Lady Dustan left Selwyn Park to return to London , she arranged for a small party at the manor house , wishing to mark the occasion of her departure . For that event , the manor house was splendidly lit up and quite full of company . Lady Dustan and Mary were listening to Gordon talk about his upcoming expedition to Africa , when Lydia interrupted to invite Gordon to join a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lydia.insisted . " You know you are my favorite partner , my darling . I ca n't play without you . " " It seems my services are required at the whist table , " he told Lady Dustan and Mary , and allowed himself to be led away . Lady Dustan smiled after the couple approvingly . " It is wonderful to see Lydia so much in love . And I believe I shall come to be quite fond of Gordon . Lydia seems quite willing to take him in hand and calm his warm , unguarded temper . That is , of course , a wife 's role . And that role will , I think , soothe Lydia 's own excitable nature . It 's a fine match . I 'm quite confident that Mr. Gordon will be calling on your father when we return to London . " " Miss Selina and Mr. Paxton seem to have an amiable attachment to one another as well , " Mary said . " I do believe they have become close friends . " " Friends ? " Lady Dustan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . " If you think that will lead to romance , I will tell you that you are mistaken . A man and wife have no business being friends . That 's like a friendship between ... between a man and a tiger . " " Ah , " Mary said . " Like a man and a tiger . " Just that morning , she had , while wandering in the garden , caught a glimpse of Sir Radford scratching the ears of the tiger . He had made her swear she would not tell the others , lest they be tempted to attempt to try the same - to their peril . " Certainly , " Lady Dustan said . " There could be no question of friendship there . " Mary nodded , keeping her own council and acquiescing to Lady Dustan 's firmly held belief . After her return to London , Lady Dustan was astounded to receive a letter from Sir Radford indicating that George had asked for Selina 's hand in marriage . She returned to Selwyn Park for the wedding . At Selina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and despite Lady Dustan 's earnest protestations , the wedding-itself did not take place in the manor house chapel , as would have been customary and proper . Instead , the couple was joined in matrimony alfresco , on the lawn beneath the shade trees near the elephant enclosure . Throughout the ceremony , Lady Dustan kept a nervous eye on the elephants . Fortunately the bull elephant spent his time placidly watching the goings on and flapping his ears idly . He behaved himself and gave Lady Dustan no cause for alarm or retreat , for which she was very grateful . George continued his work with the Zoological Society , dividing his time between London and Selwyn Park . Selina accompanied him to the city . Her grace and charm ( and the fortune that she would have from Sir Radford ) made her welcome in the Paxton home . Lydia and Gordon were married as well , in a splendid ( though conventional ) wedding in London . Mary , benefiting from the observation of these two very different marriages , formed her own opinion of the connections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though her understanding of the matter differed substantially from Lady Dustan 's , she never endeavored to share her views on the vagaries of the human heart with that formidable individual . Though Selina and George enjoyed London , they retained their affection for Selwyn Park . Every month , she and George returned to the country for the night of the full moon . 7 "
