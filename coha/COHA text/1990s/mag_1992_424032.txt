<p> Here 's how I select brushes and prepared mixtures of paint to create the visual effects most appropriate for the subjects of my oil paintings . <p> One OF THE MOST HELPFUL LESSONS I OFFER MY students concerns the actual application of oil paints to the surface of a prepared canvas . I show them how the different strokes they can make with a brush can allow them to create the appearance and mood of a subject more quickly and effectively than they had imagined possible . A few horizontal strokes made with a flat bristle brush can describe reflections on the surface of water ; marks from a small , round sable brush can create convincing tree branches ; and the broad strokes of a large , flat brush can quickly fill in big areas of a canvas . <p> This lesson is n't complicated since there are a limited number of brush types and sizes , but it can be difficult for students to put the concepts into practice unless they become familiar with the brush types and how they can be used most effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students see a remarkable improvement in their work . Instead of making clumsy , repetitive brushstrokes , they begin to add variety to the thickness , length , and texture of their marks . BASIC TYPES OF BRUSHES <p> I use two different shapes of brushes : flats and rounds . As the names imply , flats are made with hairs tapered down to a line , while the hairs of round brushes taper to a point . <p> Flat brushes are good for quickly laying in the initial layers of color with a generous amount of painting medium . They can also be utilized to scumble over a wide surface while you concentrate on the arrangement of the major color masses . I use flats a great deal when I 'm painting a winter scene and do n't want to build up too much texture in the areas of dry foliage . They can be employed to create a crusty surface on the canvas without destroying the delicate appearance of bare trees and patches of grass . The larger-size flats- Nos. 8 and 10  --  are useful in covering big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are good for applying dense , opaque layers of oil paint to the surface of a picture . I find them particularly effective in rendering the thick foliage on trees and bushes . <p> Most of my flat and round brushes are made of bristle hairs since the stiffness of these hairs is appropriate for applying heavy layers of oil paint . I do , however , have a few brushes made with sable hairs , and I use the soft hairs of these brushes for painting details  --  branches on trees , shafts of dry grass , and sparkling lights in the water , for instance . PAINTING A SMOOTH SURFACE <p> As I usually do , I started the painting Halloween by establishing the light , dark , and middle tones of the scene . I painted the entire surface of the canvas with burnt sienna oil paint thinned with a medium made of ten parts turpentine and one part linseed oil . I used a clean rag to wipe off the paint where I wanted to place the light shapes ( the window frames , door moldings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark shapes with burnt sienna and burnt umber . Because I always develop the under painting while the oil paint is still wet , I am free to move things around , make corrections , or wipe everything off the canvas and start over again . <p> Once I was satisfied with the composition of this picture , I used flat brushes to make even , satin-finish strokes of paint that described the steps and walls of the house . I mixed a fair amount of medium with the paint to make it smooth and applied it in thin layers . I then glazed over certain areas  --  THE trim around the door and the windows  --  in order to pull them forward and keep the house from looking too flat . The smooth application of paint with the flat brushes also helped create a glowing effect of light hitting these surfaces . <p> I used small , round brushes loaded with paint ( and little or no medium ) to establish the delicate trails of ivy . These were worked over the dry surface several times until I achieved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I was attracted to the scene in Hill side Farms because of its simplicity , so my object in rendering it was to convey that sense . I wanted to be careful not to overwork the painting . Instead of going back to the location several times to add more color and detail over what I had previously painted , I tried to complete this picture in one session  --  or alla prima , as the approach is often termed . I made a few refinements after returning to my studio , but most of what you see was completed on-site using flat brushes and working into the wet surface of the painting . <p> Looking at the detail of the picture reproduced above the completed work , you can see that I used broad strokes of flat brushes and did not build up much texture . I wanted the thin , untextured surface to help convey the simplicity of the scene . Normally , I build up paint in such areas as the trees and the background . PAINTING A COMPLEX SCENE <p> I did Pond on Jaketown Road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days on location . The pond was quite a distance from my home so I wanted to accomplish as much as I could each time I traveled to the spot . I started the picture by employing a large , flat brush to paint in the mass of trees in the background , the grass in the foreground , and the water in between . I then used a round brush to refine those areas and add both detail and texture to the picture . I used a small sable brush to make abrupt strokes of paint and thereby establish the tall grass growing out of the water and the broken shafts along the embankment . The same sable brush was utilized to paint the small pebbles along the shoreline and the highlights on the lily pads . <p> In the middle of the pond , I applied horizontal brushstrokes of green paint with a flat brush held perpendicular to the surface of the canvas . This gave me a pattern of lines that looked like the reflection of the grass in the water . Later , I used white paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water . <p> The brushwork in the trees was done rapidly with a flat brush , holding it at different angles and twisting it in my fingers as I first made a wide mark and then pulled the brushstrokes out to make the thin shape of an extended branch . By doing this , I was able to quickly create the appearance of the foliage and , at the same time , make the surface of the painting more interesting . CONVEYING A SENSE OF DELICACY <p> In order to convey adequately the feeling of a snowy morning in Wood stock in Winter , I used a technique called dry brushing . I first established the basic elements of the scene with an under painting similar to the one in Halloween . Then , once the under painting was completely dry , I lightly brushed on white paint mixed with a little raw umber and violet . Since I did n't add medium to the white paint , it went on in an uneven fashion , depending on the amount of pressure I applied to the brush and the texture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied a lot of pressure or made several passes over one spot , it became completely covered with the white mixture . When I held the brush so only the tips of the hairs touched the canvas and made only one or two passes over the area , the brown under painting showed through dearly . The reproduction of the detail of the church steeple demonstrates the kind of look you can create with the drybrush technique . BUILDING UP THE OIL PAINT <p> In the painting Boathouse in Central Park , you can easily see how I used round brushes to create a thick build-up of oil paint in the foliage behind the boathouse . I employed the same brushes to paint the trees close to the water 's edge in an impressionistic manner . <p> Every painting includes a combination of brushstrokes , of course , and even though this one was done primarily with round brushes , I used flats to scumble the reflected color in the pool of water and to add patches of blue sky to break up the dense greens in the background . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reflected building and the figures because I did n't want those shapes to have crisp edges . By softening the edges , I reinforced the focal point of the picture  --  the boathouse . <p> PHOTO(COLOR):Opposite page : Halloween , 1986 , oil , 30 x 24 .
