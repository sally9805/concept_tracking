Maybe you do n't mind the dents your glasses have carved into the sides of your nose . Maybe you actually enjoy cleaning your contact lenses . But if you 're anything like the 160 million other people in the U.S. who wear contact lenses or glasses , then you 've probably occasionally wondered what your life would be like with perfect vision . Oh , what a beautiful prospect ! No more foggy spectacles on winter days . No more fishing for dropped contacts in the bathroom sink . No more misplaced glasses when you 're rushing off to work . <P> You could turn those dreams into reality  --  in less than 15 minutes . Just settle onto the surgical couch at an ophthalmologist 's office and let an incredibly precise excimer laser reshape your eyes , or more accurately your corneas . Then get up and experience a bright new world . At least that 's what doctors  --  and , more important , their ecstatic patients  --  are saying about LASIK . That 's short for laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis ) , which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since they all had their tonsils removed in the 1950s . <P> Chances are you already know people who have had their eyes  --  in that newest of buzz verbs  --  lasered . Nearly 500,000 Americans are expected to undergo the procedure in 1999  --  almost double the number in 1998 . For 7 out of 10 it worked spectacularly : it corrected their vision to a very normal 20/20 . Most of the rest still saw well enough to drive without corrective lenses . By 2010 , some surgeons predict , LASIK will have advanced so far that 90% of patients will see better than 20/20 . That 's impressive for surgery you could n't get in the U.S. until just four years ago . <P> Most patients are n't just happy with the results ; they 're positively gleeful . " Everything is so clear , " says Yvonne Chapman , a registered nurse in Los Angeles who had her corneas reshaped six months ago . " I still go into the bathroom before bed every night to wash my hands and take my contacts out because I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs upwards of $2,500 an eye and is n't covered by most insurance companies . We 're talking about seeing your toes in the shower ! <P> Still feeling unsure ? Then drive over to the Fair Oaks Mall in Fairfax , Va. , outside Washington , and watch through a plate glass window as surgeons at the Visual Freedom Center perform the operation Mondays through Saturdays . Talk to the patients as they walk out the door . They will tell you how excited they are to be finally throwing away their glasses . <P> Now for the reality check . " LASIK is a surgical procedure with all the attendant risks of any surgical procedure , " says Dr. Mark Mannis , a professor of ophthalmology at the University of California at Davis , who has performed the operation on a weekly basis for the past four years . " It is highly successful in the vast majority of well-chosen cases , but "  --  and here you have to pay close attention  --  " each of those words I said is very important . " The best candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only moderately distorted , whose vision is stable and who have no other eye problems . Even so , complications occur that ca n't always be corrected .
