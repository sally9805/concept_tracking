JET should be the Bible of our profession , " often railed the late JET Associate Publisher Robert E. Johnson ( then managing editor ) during staff meetings in Chicago in the early 1950s . Coming from various regions of the country , the newly recruited journalists to whom he spoke eagerly picked up the challenge to make the little magazine a big source of information and truth for the Blacks who a half century ago could n't walk main streets of most Deep South cities and towns . Even in the nation 's capital , the major theaters , restaurants and hotels were off limits to them . Schools were as segregated as the neighborhoods . And only a small number of Blacks voted , so there were only a few elected Black officials . But Bob , as Johnson was affectionately called , kept the magazine tuned to " the Movement " to improve Blacks ' plight .

Covering the story for weeks , JET staffers were present and recorded when the body , stuffed in a wooden box , arrived at the Chicago funeral home . Till 's skull was falling off and his mangled face revealed how horribly he had been beaten for allegedly " whistling at a White woman . " What followed was a sudden craving for JET magazine , forcing the printing of thousands of additional copies . Lines formed outside the funeral home as Chicago Blacks for the first time showed interest in civil rights . For weeks the issue seethed as a trial was held in Mississippi for two White men accused of the boy 's murder . In a bold confrontation with the state 's racist standard , Detroit Congressman Charles C. Diggs and Black reporters attended the trial . Through the pages of JET , interest in the Till case spread across the country , touching off new cries for an end to Black oppression .

Many times the journalists had to wear old clothes and disguise themselves as they tried to reach the affected families . The most dangerous assignment was traveling alone in the Deep South . One had to be careful about making telephone calls for fear someone was listening . Once in Mississippi , a JET staffer was accosted by an angry White woman who said , " You do n't live around here . Our Niggers do n't wear them kind of glasses . " Not only did JET staffers cover the activities of the array of civil rights leaders-from the NAACP 's Roy Wilkins to the National Urban League 's Whitney Young and Vernon Jordan to SCLC 's Drs . Martin Luther King , Jr . and Joseph Lowery-but they were present at all of the major demonstrations from the first March on Washington , the Selma to Montgomery March , James Farmer 's often disrupted Freedom Rides and even the " sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of students .

When company officials decided to open a Washington Bureau , they discovered how difficult it was to penetrate the real estate market . No Black firm was located in downtown D.C. At first , the representatives of real estate firms refused to discuss the subject . For the first months , the designated bureau chief , Simeon Booker , and his assistant , the late E. Fannie Granton , were forced to share space in the U Street law offices of Atty . J. Leon Williams . After New York Gov . Nelson Rockefeller was apprised of the snub , he managed to prod officers of the Standard Oil Building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill . For the real estate breakthrough , there was little cheering . Only the elevator operators , who were Black , spoke to the magazine 's staffers . This was the welcomE for the first Black-owned firm to rent space in a downtown D. C. building . During the inauguration of President Dwight Eisenhower , E. Frederic Morrow , a parade marshal , joined several hundred other guests for food and drinks at JET 's new offices . The affair marked the first of what would become an inaugural feature of the Washington , D.C. , Bureau . From the vantage point in the nation 's capital , JET expanded its orbit of coverage , tracking not only the exploding civil rights actions throughout the country but also recording the assemblage of the first Black corps of major newsmakers in government and politics . And JET established itself as a force to be reckoned with in the tight-knit D.C. press corps at a press conference during the John F. Kennedy administration .

Terms such as " the closest Black to " or " the most powerful Black " soon became obsolete as prominent individuals flocked to Washington , turning the city into a center of Black middle-class striving . And JET staffers got to walk in the corridors of power in position to interpret the news happenings and compete with the White news media . JET also assigned reporters to events throughout the world , from Africa to Europe , and gained recognition for its international coverage . As the years passed , JET 's reputation grew , and the magazine was ever-present at any major news event related to Blacks . From school desegregation to affirmative action to welfare reform to equal housing to anti-crime measures , this nation 's strategists soon began to argue over approaches to solve the serious issues of unemployment , education and housing . And Black organizations and their leaders played important roles in finding solutions and also demanded mention in JET , the publication that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recalling JET 's 45 years , another anniversary , the integration of Little Rock 's Central High , brings to mind one of the best examples of courage during the past 4 1/2 decades .

Eisenhower had ordered federal troops to protect the children at the school after Arkansas Gov . Orval Faubus refused to allow them to attend the White high school . The case was so crucial that JET had a news team on the scene for more than a month , keeping the Black community aware of the effort to enroll them led by NAACP leader Mrs. Daisy Bates . Recently , President Bill Clinton , a former governor of Arkansas , traveled to Little Rock to observe the 40th anniversary of what is regarded by many as " civil rights ' finest hour , " closing out a sad episode in race relations and brightening the first 45 years of JET 's history .
