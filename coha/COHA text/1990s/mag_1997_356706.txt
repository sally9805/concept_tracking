Ever since the appearance of Thomas Pynchon 's epic , mind-bending Gravity 's Rainbow ( 1973 ) , rumors have circulated among the faithful that the elusive author was working on two new projects : a novel about Japanese monster movies and one dealing with the 18th century drawing of the Mason-Dixon line between the ( then ) colonies of Pennsylvania and Maryland . Fragments of a Godzilla-like episode indeed appeared in Pynchon 's Vineland ( 1990 ) , and now here comes a real monster : Mason &; Dixon ( Henry Holt ; 773 pages ; $27.50 ) . <P> Pynchon , the one-time enfant terrible of American literature , turns 60 this May . He still refuses to give interviews or pose for photographers , but his whereabouts are now known . New York magazine reported last fall that Pynchon has been living quietly in Manhattan  --  an odd choice for a presumptive recluse  --  with his wife and young son for the past six or so years . In 1996 he attracted gossipy notice by writing the liner notes for an album by the alternative-rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the group 's concerts . If this behavior suggests someone in no mood to act his age , then so does Pynchon 's new novel , which shows that he is still the smartest and , occasionally , the most exasperating kid around . <P> And no one else can kid around as brilliantly as Pynchon . Mason &; Dixon bears some resemblances to Gravity 's Rainbow . Both books are huge ( the first edition of Gravity 's Rainbow ran 760 pages ) . Both have truncated double dactyls ( Duh-duh-duh Duh-duh ) as titles . Both manifest Pynchon 's trademark narrative rhythm , repeated segues from cartoonish pratfalls into surreal episodes of phantasmagoric dread , punctuated by periodic eruptions of songs or poems . <P> But Pynchon 's new novel is in some ways even more difficult than its famously challenging predecessor . This time out , the author renounces contemporary English speech altogether and casts the entire narrative in the 18th century diction allegedly spoken by a clergyman named Wicks Cherrycoke ; he is the one who tells aloud the tale of his one-time acquaintances Charles Mason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what must have been an incredibly long night in Philadelphia during the Christmas season of 1786 . Cherrycoke is given to utterances such as the following : " The Pilgrim , however long or crooked his Road , may keep ever before him the Holy Place he must by his faith seek , as the American Ranger , however indeterminate or unposted his Wilderness , may enjoy , ever at his Back , the Impulse of Duty he must , by his Honor , attend . " <P> Such formal prose does not entirely squelch the sort of tomfooleries that Pynchon devotees so eagerly search out . When , for example , Mason takes offense at a remark by his partner , Dixon asks , " Tell me , what 'd I say ? " The anachronistic allusion to Ray Charles ' future rock hit will tickle the cognoscenti . The book teems with other familiar Pynchonesque diversions : a talking dog that appears near the beginning and again near the end of the story ; a four-ton cheese called " The Octuple Gloucester " ; a journey by Mason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of 18th century notables , including Benjamin Franklin , George and Martha Washington ( who sing a duet ) and Dr. Samuel Johnson , accompanied by his biographer-to-be James Boswell .
