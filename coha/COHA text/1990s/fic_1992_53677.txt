Monday her car would n't start and Anita spent all day renting-a-wreck and driving like crazy to the hospital two hours away , and at five she arrived , and at five her father was n't dead . <p> ( It was the carburetor , she found out later . ) <p> At five Anita 's father was only dying : a man so pumped with fluid he 'd gained forty pounds , a kidney-less man who 'd stopped smelling like himself . At five her father was n't dead , only dying , and he knew who she was . <p> Anita , who works as a nurse , climbed into her father 's hospital bed beside him , and her brother , who 'd already said so many false goodbyes , left . Anita 's mother was stuck : a wife of thirty-five years who could do nothing but crank up the bed , cranking it up , cranking it down again . <p> ( " Should I have divorced him ? " Anita ' , s mother had asked her children . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ? " ) <p> At five Anita 's father still knew her , but he was a man making faces : horrible faces , as if all the work of drawing air into his lungs must be done by his face . And Anita lay next to him , whispering : " Let go . This body does n't work anymore . Let it go . " <p> ( Anita had married that fall , partly to give her father one last party to host , partly to cover her bulletin board with pictures of him giving her away . ) <p> Maybe at the end , in his brain , there was n't enough oxygen to find comfort in an afterlife or to reconsider euthanasia . And maybe then , in his chest , there was n't enough muscle to be his heart . <p> ( The heart , they said at the autopsy , was no more than a blown-up paper bag , a paper bag trying to pump blood . ) <p> At six thirty Anita asked the nurse for more morphine . " For the pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse gave it that morphine right then might cause death . <p> " Why are you doing this ? ! " Anita 's father whispered , sounding angry and hurt , and not possibly knowing . <p> Five minutes later he was dead . Five minutes later it was six thirty-five and Anita was lying in a hospital bed next to a man she could n't recognize , a dead man who neither looked nor smelled like her father . <p> ( For weeks she wore her father 's clothes . " Here , smell this , " she said . " It still smells like my father . " ) <p> At six thirty-five it was over , unmistakably gone , but at five Anita 's father was n't dead , only dying , and he knew who she was . <p> <p> By Barbara Selfridge <p>
