The words come slowly , haltingly . " I just want to have a baby , " she says , her voice trembling . " It 's pretty simple . It has little to do with " balancing out my personal and professional life . ' It 's just a normal desire . " Articulate , attractive , wildly successful and just weeks away from her 47th birthday , the speaker would be a dream guest on any of daytime 's glut of tell-all programs , a camera-ready confessor for a show on " Career Women Who Have It All Except the Baby They Want More Than Anything . " But Oprah , Geraldo and Phil can save their bookers a phone call . Though the career woman in question  --  CBS Evening News 's Connie Chung  --  has one of the highest popularity ratings of any woman in network news ( she is also among broadcasting 's highest-paid females , at a reported $2 million-plus a year ) , she is , in truth , a rather private person . " I interview a lot of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , " she says . " But I do n't feel comfortable revealing my own innermost thoughts . " Besides , she says , nervously smoking a cigarette in a posh Italian restaurant on Manhattan 's West Side . " I once said that I would never share my most intimate thoughts , even with a talk show host . Except for maybe one . " That one , of course , is Maury Povich , 54 , host of an eponymous daily show that 's syndicated nationally and Chung 's husband since 1984 . " It has n't been easy for us , " she says , reaching over to pick a bit of lint off Povich 's collar before slipping her hand inside his . " It 's been difficult . " Indeed , three years have passed since Chung stunned both fans and colleagues by shelving her popular Face to Face with Connie Chung show  --  and , it seemed , her entire career  --  with a brief announcement : " I now need to take a very aggressive approach to having a baby . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ongoing ordeal that she finds too personal and distressing to discuss in detail  --  has failed . Yet they say they are still trying to conceive . " We 've been disappointed , " says Povich , " but we 're not discouraged . " With that , Chung reverts to her characteristic perkiness . " I really think Maury is the greatest husband , " she says . " I 've been given every bit of support that any woman would ever want . He has always been there for me . He is a great rock . " Chung , of course , is something of a neophyte rock herself ; since June 1 , she has been Dan Rather 's coanchor on the CBS Evening News . ( She 'll be doing double duty Thursday nights beginning this week , when the newsmagazine Eye to Eye with Connie Chung premieres on June 17 . ) When Chung told Povich that she 'd be spending five evenings a week with another man , he sent Rather flowers , along with a card that read , " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in return , offers a bouquet of his own . " I do n't think Connie 's given nearly enough credit , " he says . " She 's earned this . I consider her my professional sister , and anybody who picks on my sister has to come through me . " Among the first he might want to take on is critic Tom Shales of The Washington Post , who once tagged the future hostess of the celebrity-driven Saturday Night with Connie Chung and Face to Face with Connie Chung " Connie Funn . " Of the new Rather-Chung pairing , Shales wrote that the duo were " touching hands again and again , almost playing patty-cake before the final fadeout . " In fact , though Chung has been a TV news reporter for more than two decades and has won three Emmy awards , her ascent to the nightly anchoring seat is seen by many as more of a ploy to goose the ratings of Rather 's stagnant , second-ranked news hour ( ABC 's World News Tonight , with Peter Jennings , is No. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ms. Chung 's most common expression is a blank earnestness , " declared Walter Goodman of The New York Times the morning after her hyped debut as Rather 's partner ( CBS says overnight ratings jumped by 6 percent , though the show still finished second nationally ) . " You get the feeling that her acquaintance with most of the subjects assigned to her does not reach much beyond the words rolling by on her TelePrompTer . " Barbara Walters , coanchor of ABC 's newsmagazine 20/20 and the only other woman to have regularly occupied an anchor seat on a nightly network news program ( with Harry Reasoner , 1976-78 ) , is well acquainted with harsh reviews . " I was crucified for reasons including How dare there be a woman there , " says Walters . Walters 's advice concerning reviews , says Chung , is , " ' Do n't read those things ! " But I always do . I have to develop a thicker skin . " It is , however , neither the critics nor her peers who most intimidate Chung . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her four older sisters , Josephine , 61 , Charlotte , 59 , June , 56 , and Mimi , 51 , all married , all with children ( two with grandchildren ) and , she claims , all more vivacious and outspoken than she . Overshadowed by the boisterous brood growing up in Washington , Chung still reverts to baby-of-the-family status  --  despite fame and that $2 million salary  --  whenever they get together . " Last weekend I was visiting my mom , and she had me picking off the tails on bean sprouts one by one , " she says with a laugh . " It does n't matter how old you are . Once you 've fallen into a role , you ca n't climb out . " From the beginning , roles in the Chung family were unusual  --  by American standards , at least . Her father , William , who died three years ago , did n't lay eyes on her mother until , at 19 , he raised the veil of his 17-year-old bride during their wedding ceremony in Soochow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their marriage ; like many Chinese men of his generation , William Chung , an officer in Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek 's intelligence agency , kept concubines . " My mother would tell us these horrible stories , " Connie recalls , " where she would walk into a restaurant and say , " I 'm here to meet with Mr. Chung , ' and they would say , " Oh , Mrs. Chung is already back there . ' She would be livid . " When the family moved to the U.S. in 1945 , the custom of concubines in the Chung family ended  --  and the next year Margaret gave birth to her 10th and final child , Constance Yu-hwa Chung . ( Two daughters and three sons had died in China . ) Aware of the premium placed on male children in traditional Chinese culture , Connie says that even as a young girl " I wanted to be my father 's son and perpetuate the family name . " She did that with dispatch , becoming an on-air reporter for the local CBS news affiliate in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree in journalism in 1969 . By the early ' ' 70s she was a CBS network correspondent , covering the biggest political stories : Nixon 's trip to the Soviet Union , Watergate , presidential elections . " It was real elbow work , " says Chung . " I burrowed my way through the crowd of reporters and popped up in front . " Even broadcast legend Walter Cronkite admired her style . " Being confrontational is all right , " says Cronkite , 76 , the CBS Evening News anchor from 1962 to ' ' 81 . " But Connie Chung also always remained civil . She was able to ask tough questions in an intelligent way . " But by the summer of 1990 , asking tough questions had become less important to Chung than having a baby . ( Povich has two daughters from an earlier marriage to college sweetheart Phyllis Minkoff : Susan , 29 , a lawyer and TV producer , and Amy , 26 , an actress , both living in Manhattan . ) " Unfortunately , " she said in her press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For years , in fact , Chung had consciously delayed motherhood . Povich and Chung dated for seven years before they wed . " I truly knew from the beginning that Maury was the one , but I just did n't have it in me to commit myself , " she told PEOPLE in 1989 . " I was having a grand old time . " Their first year together was a commuter marriage ; she lived in L.A. , where she was a local news anchor for a CBS affiliate , while he was anchoring the news in San Francisco . And yes , concedes Chung , she does wish they had thought about starting a family earlier . Says she : " I 'm a big should 've , would 've , could 've person . " Concerned that by now biology has become destiny and she may remain childless , Chung is a bit fretful as well that her new network duties will hurt her marriage . " I 'm worried that I just wo n't have enough time , " says Chung , " and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I value him so much . " Meanwhile , however , life goes on , and very pleasantly . Maury golfs . Connie shops ( " It 's mental therapy to get lost in something mundane and fun " ) . Together they cheer on the New York Knicks and eat lots of order-in Chinese . " My cooking really does n't taste good , " admits Chung , standing in the immaculate , cozy white kitchen of their six-room Manhattan apartment . " I can never get the meat and the vegetables to come out at the same time . " Eager as always to please , Chung offers a guest the best her culinary skills can muster : " a glass of orange juice , ice water , a bagel . " That last offer accepted , one of the highest-paid women in broadcast television stands in front of a toaster oven and provides instant analysis . " When the bell rings , " she says dryly , " it means it 's done . " Edward R. Murrow could n't have said it better . <p>  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
