<p> Since 1915 The Best American Short Stories has been the publishing world 's preeminent yearly collection of short fiction . For each edition a different guest editor  --  this year it 's Annie Proulx  --  picks the stories with the help of the series editor at Houghton Mifflin , who since 1990 has been Katrina Kenison . <p> The following interactive interview of Kenison by the book 's readers is excerpted with permission from BarnesandNoble.com , the bookstore chain 's World Wide Web site . <p> Q. It 's weird to hear the words " bestselling " and " short stories " in the same sentence . Why do you think short story collections are so difficult to sell ? <p> A. I wish I knew . Every time the publishing industry decides to agree that short stories do n't sell , along comes a collection that surprises everyone  --  its author more than anyone else  --  by becoming a bestseller . It happened 10 years ago with Ethan Canin 's Emperor of the Air , and it happened again last year with Junot Diaz ' Drown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how they can make a collection sell as well , only to conclude once again that short stories never sell . The Best American Short Stories sells about 100,000 copies a year with very little promotion , which leads me to think that there is a healthy market for short stories that are well-written and well-published . <p> Q. What criteria do you use to select the stories for your book ? <p> A. All have to have appeared previously in an American or Canadian magazine with national distribution . They must also be written originally in English by an American or by someone who is making their home in America . The only other rule is that we try not to consider novel excerpts , although they do sneak in . <p> Q. The 1995 Best American Short Stories featured " Xuela , " by Jamaica Kincaid , which is part of her novel The Autobiography of My Mother . Likewise , Frederick Busch 's " Ralph the Duck " became the second chapter of his latest novel , Girls . What does this say ? <p> A. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance of " Xuela , " editor John Edgar Wideman and I both read that story initially without knowing that it would be part of Kincaid 's novel . When we learned that , we discussed dropping it , and in fact I urged him to do so , simply because our criteria are clear about novel excerpts . However , he felt strongly that the piece had been presented to him as a story , he had taught it as a story , and for him it worked as a story . He also very much wanted another black writer in the collection . And so the decision was his . <p> As I 've read all of the editions of Best through this century , I found many , many stories that grew into novels . It often happens that writers begin to write without knowing where their characters or plots will take them , that they may finish a story only to find that they are not really finished at all . <p> Q. How do you feel about the authors ' notes , in the appendixes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their stories ? I think it ruins an aspect of the story  --  it limits a reader 's interpretation . <p> A. We ask it of the authors , and many admit to me that writing that short piece is harder than writing the story itself . We include these brief essays because many aspiring writers read this collection every year and are hungry to know the stories behind the stories . There have been a couple of instances in which I almost wished I had n't read the note . One was when the author said the story grew out of a writing assignment for class . But for the most part , I think these pieces show the wonderful way imagination can work , how from a single image or thought can spring an entire tale . <p> Q. How do you have time to read so many short stories ? Your house must be jam-packed with quarterlies and collections and journals . <p> A. I have subscriptions to over 300 magazines and periodicals . That adds up to about 3,000 short stories a year . This is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of this big project I 've been working on  --  The Best American Short Stories of the Century  --  my reading load has been doubled . <p> Q. What are your favorite magazines ? <p> A. The New Yorker has to be at the top of the list , much maligned though it has been . There are a number of wonderful literary magazines I ca n't wait to read . Among them are Ploughshares ; Epoch ; the Paris Review , which not only has wonderful fiction but wonderful author interviews ; Calyx , a woman 's journal ; The Sun , a quirky magazine published in Chapel Hill in which many of the readers are also the writers ; Doubletake and Prairie Schooner , to name just a few that are consistently strong . <p> Q. What 's your favorite edition of Best American Short Stories , and why ? <p> A. I think the current volume , edited by Annie Proulx , is definitely the strongest collection of the ' 90s . There are a number of new writers , a tremendous range of styles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . The fact that Junot Diaz , a young writer just starting out , appears next to Donald Hall , whose most recent story in Best American was in 1961 , suggests the range of the work . And these two stories happen to be my own personal favorites , although they are as different in tone and style as any two stories can be . <p> Q. Who 'll be editor of The Best American Short Stories 1998 ? <p> A. Garrison Keillor . He is reading the first batch of stories right now . <p> Q. How do you choose guest editors ? <p> A. The editors at Houghton Mifflin and I suggest names , and we try to vary the sensibility from year to year . <p> Q. I understand Donald Hall is featured in the 1997 edition . Knowing that he is primarily recognized for his poetry , I am curious to what extent he has written fiction . <p> A. Hall is also a memoirist , essayist , and Renaissance man . The story in the ' 97 volume was written at his wife 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all the more poignant to know that he was able to read this extraordinary work aloud to her before she died . Even in his grief he has continued to produce a beautiful and passionate body of work , a collection of poems about his late wife , and the finest stories of his long career . <p> Q. Who do you consider the masters of short fiction ? <p> A. I would include Tobias Wolff , Thom Jones , Andre Dubus , Alice Munro , Baharati Mukherjee and John Updike , who may well be the master of them all . There are , of course , others whose names were not even known until the last few years but who are already staking out their territory , among them Ha Jin , Lan Samantha Chang , Amy Bloom , Junot Diaz . <p> Q. I 've heard people say the short story is an American form , invented , defined and mastered in America . What distinguishes the American short story from those in other countries ? <p> A. It does seem to be true that American writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other countries have ignored or shied away from it . When I was in Paris two years ago , I was surprised to find that the French really have no short story tradition whatsoever . They feel that to be taken seriously , one must write novels . But we have such a grand tradition in the short story , thanks to such masters as John Cheever , Flannery O'Connor , Bernard Malamud , Isaac Bashevis Singer , and Eudora Welty , to name just a few , that our writers have grown up with a great respect for the form . They do n't make the mistake of thinking of short stories as a kind of literary warm-up exercise . In fact , they aspire to do it justice . I would say that the Irish and the English have as healthy a tradition as we do , and one of the great regrets I have in this job is not being able to consider short stories by William Trevor and other Irish and English writers . <p> Q. Do you have a favorite type of story ? <p> A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn to coming-of-age stories , and I have to beware of that predilection as I read . But the kind of story that intrigues me the most is probably the story that tries to deal with serious themes through humor . I think it is a great challenge many of our writers are afraid to tackle . Perhaps they feel that to be taken seriously , they must be serious . But if you combine intelligence and humor , you will not only get readers ' attention but also their undying gratitude . <p> Q. You are now putting together Best American Short Stories of the Century . What did you learn from past editions ? <p> A. When the series began in 1915 , the world was a different place and the stories reflected that . People had very few sources of information , not to mention entertainment . Stories were a way of bringing the world into the hands of readers who would never see it themselves , and they were stuffed with visual details , eccentric characters , and wild plots , all saying , " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Now we have simply to flick on the TV , the radio , or our computers if we want to be shocked or amazed . The world is in front of us in living , lurid color . Consequently , fiction over the course of this century has moved inward . It has become a means of examining the inner life , the tossing and turning of the soul . <p> The physical world we inhabit  --  and take so much for granted  --  has changed dramatically , too . We 've gone from horses and candles to space stations and computers . For example , I was reading a minor Steinbeck story and came across a reference to a train " racing along at 40 mph . " Even our idea of speed has changed dramatically , not to mention all those little details of daily life . The old stories are like photographs from the past . We can study them to find out not only how people thought and struggled with the big issues , but also how they passed the time of day .
