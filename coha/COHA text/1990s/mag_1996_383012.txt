From Andreu to Walden , Merckx to Furtado , for 35 years we 've pumped generations of riders and coaches for their secrets . Here are some of the best // ROAD " The most common cause of a pileup is trying to go through a hole that is n't there . If you 're in the middle of a pack , shooting for one gap wo n't make any difference . When I was a young racer I went for everything . I dove inside next to curbs and tried to go through small holes . I crashed a lot . In the Tour of Texas one year I crashed every day . I just kept doing stupid things . When you 're riding in a big field you need to stay in the top 10 or 15 . This way you 're less likely to crash , and you can pick your line through corners . You 'll also expend a lot less energy because every time a pack corners there 's a whiplash effect-those toward the rear are forced to slow , then accelerate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire race you might not finish . It 's 10 times harder than being in front where you can do your own thing and be aggressive . " - Frankie Andreu , pro road racer ( March ' 91 ) ROAD " The Europeans look down on raising your hands for victory . They do n't like the end-zone dance . I think that 's unfortunate . That feeling-the finish line , the last couple of metersis what motivates me . If I could bottle that up and sell it I 'd be the richest man in the world . This is the most overlooked thing . Shoot for the extraordinary , not the ordinary . " - Lance Armstrong , ' 93 pro world road champion ( July ' 94 ) ROAD " For full-tuck descending , basically you need to get everything tight to reduce frontal area . Keep your chest out of the wind , your knees and elbows in , and your head low . If it 's a straight shot you can reach a much higher speed by putting the front of your shouldersyour deltoids-right on the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far forward . " - Steve Bauer , pro road racer ( January ' 91 ) ROAD " The biggest mistake is eating differently in training and racing . You do n't just train muscle-you must train the stomach . Eat from the start of a race but not for the last 10 miles . On the bike , eat a variety of foods-fresh fruit , dried fruit , energy drink . " - Eddie Borysewicz , road team coach ( April ' 92 ) ROAD " Think of training as a pyramid-every year your base gets wider . The last two years I 've spent more hours on the bike . Now an easy ride is three hours , and six hours is common . But three or four years ago , if I did a six-hour ride I 'd be shot for a week . The more you ride the more efficient you become . Even for racers , it can take years . But if you just train long you can run yourself into the ground . Races are n't like thatthey get faster at the end . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours and then do some intense work such as hill intervals at the end . There 's a big difference between doing hill intervals when you 're fresh and when you 've been out for four hours . " - Bart Bowen , pro road racer ( September ' 92 ) ROAD " One of the biggest problems in descending is fear . What if I have a blowout ? What if this guy crashes in front of me ? You 've got to feel your way down the mountain and not worry . Let 's say you drift too far around a corner . If you continue to think about how close you came to the edge , you 'll never make it down . It does n't matter if you were two inches from death or two meters . You did n't die . You ca n't dwell on it . Also , people tend to stay way too close to each other . Then you must react as the other person reacts . Instead , allow a little room . Then if the other guy goes over the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national team coach aune ' 92 ) ROAD " No great champion rides at the same speed all the time , but many recreational riders do . In order to learn to ride fast , you must learn to ride slow . This is an easy , 10- to 15mile ride in a small gear , say 42x21-teeth . The purpose is to learn to relax on your bike . Plus , it 's great for recovery . " - Connie Carpenter , ' 84 Olympic road champion ( June ' 88 ) MOUNTAIN " Without suspension I used to climb out of the saddle all the time . But with it , I would stand and watch my fork blades go up and down , so I stay in the saddle as much as possible . Also , when climbing in the saddle keep your upper body low , flex your elbows , bend at the hips , and keep your back fairly straight . You have to lean your chest pretty darn close to the handlebar. " - Susan DeMattei , pro mountain biker ( January ' 94 ) MOUNTAIN " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And my descending in races is totally instinctual . I 'm only thinking of someone ahead of me or behind me . But I never go fast in training because I ca n't justify getting hurt . That just would n't make sense . " - Juli Furtado , ' 90 world cross-country champion ( May ' 94 ) ROAD " Most women who want to race or just ride in a pack are intimidated by bike handling . To learn the skills and build confidence , find a club and ride with guys . Seek out big groups . You have to put yourself in the pack . Contest the sprints and try to stay in as long as you can . " - Jeanne Golay , pro road racer ( May ' 95 ) ROAD " When a sprint is imminent , firmly grasp the handlebar drops midway between the bend and end . This allows you to pull at an angle perpendicular to the ground . Bike control is difficult if your grip is too close to the bar end . " - Mark Gorski , ' 84 Olympic sprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your natural breathing rhythm is best . Use measured breaths and do n't panic-the key is to learn not to break out of your rhythm . But there are tricks . If you breathe a lot at the bottom of a climb you can supercharge your system with oxygen . Or try taking one or two deep breaths and not exhaling immediately-holding it for a second . A lot of riders do this unconsciously after cresting a climb . " - Alexi Grewal , ' 84 Olympic road champ ( December ' 90 ) MOUNTAIN " The controls of your bike should be a natural extension of your body . You should be able to close your eyes and grab the handlebar , and the brake levers should be right where you want them . Set the brakes a little loose , so the levers can travel closer to the grips . This enables you to have a better grip around the levers and the handlebar , for better control with less hand fatigue . " - Greg Herbold , pro mountain biker ( july ' 92 ) ROAD " In general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head down and back stretched is the most efficient road riding position and the best for the spine . It 's more efficient to pedal ' at the back ' with a sizable saddle setback , than at the front . ' This helps you push and pull your foot through the dead spots , stabilizing the pelvis and counteracting the natural tendency to slide forward . " - Bernard Hinault , 5-time Tour de France winner ( March ' 92 ) ROAD " When you 're on the starting line of your first century , it 's not wise to sit there and think , I 've got to ride a hundred miles . ' I remember my first one , and my thought was to get to the first rest stop . I made each succeeding rest stop my goal . When they 're about 25 miles apart , you do n't get intimidated . All you need to do is ride 25 miles four times . " - Seana Hogan , 4-time Race Across America winner ( April ' 93 ) ROAD " Keep your leg speed high . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to keep your speed better . Mine is usually 80-90 rpm , but some riders on pro teams push bigger gearsSean Yates , for instance . Greg LeMond is a big gear stomper . But since I 'm not so powerful , I have to compensate by spinning . If you spin , you tend to go faster . " - Ron Kiefel , pro road racer ( November ' 90 ) ROAD " A lot of times you 're told to keep your upper body as still as possible . But when I climb , I do n't follow this rule . If you 're sitting perfectly still , you 're stiff . You should n't move too much , but some upper-body movement is necessary if you 're to find a rhythm . Climbing involves the upper body more than riding on the flats . You have to train the upper body to climb . Learn to use the shoulders and chest . Use them with the handlebar to control the bike and to give it power . Use the bike to move yourself forward . " - Atle Kvalsvoll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's no better training than riding hills . It forces you to a higher pulse rate , and it 's not boring . It 's exciting to climb and descend . For me , it 's the easiest way to get in shape . I usually ride four to five hours , but it depends on my workout . If I want high intensity I only do two or three hours . If I want endurance I do six . But you do n't need that . I think gains in endurance can come from between one and four hours . Endurance also comes from increasing your leg power and strength through sprints and short intervals . Also work just below your anaerobic threshold for five to ten minutes at a time , which comes from climbing . " - Greg LeMond , 3-time Tour de France winner ( August ' 90 ) ROAD/MOUNTAIN " When climbing on the road I would sit and put my hands on top of the bar near the stem , or stand with my hands on the brake hoods . On a mountain bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which provides better breathing and more control . I also find that bar-ends are key for getting more air into the lungs and applying power when climbing . " - Ruthie Matthes , pro mountian biker ( December ' 93 ) ROAD/MOUNTAIN " In the early season I spend a lot of time riding rollers to improve my pedaling technique . For most riders , a few times a week is plenty . The idea is to get your legs spinning fast . Music is a great motivator for high-rpm intervals . A song on the radio typically has from 80-135 beats per minute . Pedal to it . If you can believe it , the key to my win in the pursuit semifinals at the ' 92 worlds was changing the tape for my warm-up on the rollers . I went from a slower tape to a faster one with about 130 beats per minute . " - Mike McCarthy , pro road racer ( January ' 93 ) ROAD/MOUNTAIN " Ride lots . " - Eddy Merckx , 5-time Tour de France winner ( July ' 87 ) MOUNTAIN " Anytime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than run it , I 'll put the bike on my shoulder . Dismount , then grab the top or down tube . If you 're using a mountain bike with water bottles , grab the top tube , palm up . Otherwise , grab the down tube low near the bottom bracket . Put your arm through the main triangle and place the bike on your shoulder . Riders using frames with small triangles may need to rest the saddle nose on their shoulder . How you carry the bike is important . I see a lot of mountain bikers holding the stem . This pulls the bike down on the shoulder and makes you sore . If you hold the steerer or head tube , it 'll reduce pressure . " - Don Myrah , pro mountain biker ( March ' 93 ) ROAD " One of the biggest mistakes is trying to keep up with the best guys on a climb when it 's not your destiny . Climbing cadence is n't something you can dictate . You either have it or you do n't . If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have a slower rhythm . If you 're the type who flies like an eagle , you 'll have a faster rhythm . Eddy Merckx had a slow rhythm . He 'd let the Spanish riders attack , then he 'd reel them in steadily . Hypnotize yourself into a cadence . When you increase your gear , maintain that cadence . Once you lose it , that 's it . " - Mike Neel , pro road racer/coach ( May ' 92 ) MOUNTAIN " A lot of people slide through turns , but it 's not the fastest way . If the corner is n't that sharp , just pedal through . If you 're going to have to slow so much that you ca n't pedal , then look for a rut or berm that you can put your wheel into to keep it from sliding . I also use something I call angulation . ' I lean my bike into the turn and angle my body in the opposite direction so my weight is more over the tires . At the same time my outside leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain traction in loose dirt . If you lean to the inside your tires would slide . " - Ned Overend , ' 90 world cross-country champion ( August ' 92 ) ROAD " Classic sprinting form is to have your weight back initially to keep the rear wheel from skipping , and use a strong sideto-side arm motion . Then as your rpm increases , come forward over the bike and use less of the arms , or sit and power to the line . That 's classic form , but it 's never been effective for me . I wo n't move forward , and I never tend to go over the top of a gear and spin . I 'm not that fast in the saddle or at high rpm . It 's an individual thing , but I 'd say you should n't move too far forward too quickly when you come off the saddle . " - Davis Phinney , pro road racer/coach ( September ' 93 ) MOUNTAIN " The start of a mountain bike race is ballistic . You sit at the start for 15 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly . Everyone 's legs feel like cement . It 's super-high intensity , and then you just go until you fade . That 's basically what a mountain bike race is . So instead of experiencing the start for the first time in a race , ensure that you can go at a high intensity by doing it in training . " - Daryl Price , pro mountain biker ( August ' 94 ) ROAD/MOUNTAIN " To do a trackstand start by rolling forward as slowly as possible , then come to a stop . It 's good to run up against a small bump or hill with your front wheel . Or you can practice next to a fence and lean on it . Everyone has what I call a good and a bad pedal-when the crankarms are horizontal you feel more stable with one pedal forward than the other . Put your good pedal forward . Turn the handlebar whichever way is comfortable . ( For me , it 's away from my good pedal . ) Put your weight really far forward over the stem , with most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body the same way as the front wheel and put your hip out to the side . Apply either brake and put pressure on the chain by pedaling against the brake . Rock by pulling on the brake , pedaling , braking , pedaling , and so on . Move just slightlyand inch or so . Do n't look at your front wheel . Instead , look at a fixed point five to six feet ahead . It 's like carrying a full cup of tea . If you do n't look at it , you can balance it better . " - Hans Rey , pro stunt rider ( November ' 92 ) ROAD/MOUNTAIN " It 's OK to eat almost anything you want as long as you do not eat too much of it . Remember that you will pay for everything . If you eat too many grams of fat you must train that much more to get rid of them . " - Tony Rominger , pro road racer ( November ' 93 ) ROAD/MOUNTAIN " Even if you 're just riding for fitness or to lose weight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When your body goes into starvation mode , you crave fat . You want to binge eat and those calories go more toward fat . The worst thing you can do is limit the calories too much during a ride . If I bonk during a race I eat a gigantic meal afterward and end up gaining weight . Finish your ride not starving . " John Stamstad , endurance rider aune ' 95 ) ROAD " Try not to use your brakes while turning . Make a conscious decision-say , OK , now I 've slowed enough , ' then release the brake , put your weight toward the outside , and make the turn . I can really carve turns this way . In one race I leaned so far I rubbed my glove on the top of someone 's rear wheel . It made a burn mark . You can get away with some braking in a corner if traction is good . If you must do it , use only the rear brake . If the back wheel slides you can stay up , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stieda , pro road racer ( April ' 92 ) MOUNTAIN " If you 're on rocks or an unstable surface , you 've got to let go of the brakes until you get to a place where you can apply them . This means that sometimes you have to go faster than you 'd like . Letting go of the brakes in order to get back on a good line is one of the hardest technical things to learn . " - john Tomac , pro mountain biker ( Sept. ' 91 ) ROAD/MOUNTAIN " After a layoff from cycling , you ca n't expect to be back at your old level right away . When I stopped competing from ' 88 to ' 91 , the first six to eight weeks after I came back I felt like I could n't even pedal right . I just did n't have smoothness . But overall the layoff was a benefit . There was a definite psychological value to it . I wanted to experience the real world , and I was tired of pushing my body to the limit all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But the most important thing is that I have a different attitude . I want to be out there , and it shows . " - Rebecca Twigg , world pursuit champion ( December ' 92 ) ROAD " Pedaling is the essence of our sport . Everyone thinks I 'm small-gear crazy , but pedaling fast for long periods helps develop the proper neuromuscular pathways . You must learn how to pedal quickly , then you can slow it down and develop power . Do n't start by teaching yourself to pedal slowly because it 's a hard process to reverse .
