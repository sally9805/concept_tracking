To adequate theory in the social sciences explains how values change , so it is very difficult to anticipate changing social values . On the other hand , the social sciences are outstanding in reporting and exploring historic patterns of social change and in reporting contemporary social values through surveys , opinion polls , and observational research . Identifying long-term shifts in values is complicated by the great deal of attention given to fads-that is , transient enthusiasms . A good example is " family values , " a topic of great interest in recent political seasons . Both the family and values are undergoing shifts , and the challenge for futurists and other observers of social change is to identify the long-term trends and implications in both of these important areas . Social values are slowly evolving trends . To help you understand the myriad of evolving patterns in families , this article describes several major trends and forecasts in families and values and suggests what they may imply for the future . TREND I Stresses on Family Functions The family in the United States is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous , the outcomes over the next decades remain uncertain . Anthropologists agree that the family is a central , positive institution in every society . It performs two functions : the nurturing and socialization of children and the regulation of the expression of sexuality . In European and North American society , the family serves another basic function : companionship . Also important are the economic functions of families , such as providing care for the elderly and sick and social support for unemployed members . All of these family functions are being stressed by structural changes in society Among the patterns that have long-term implications are : Increased life-spans mean that adults live well past the period in which nurturing and socialization of children is central to their lives . In many cases , longevity leads to the death of one spouse substantially before the other , creating a companionship crisis . * Sexual behavior is increasingly being separated from its procreative function , thanks to reproductive technologies such as artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization , as well as contraceptives. * New patterns of work and leisure mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from other members of their family . In many cases , this leads to conflicting interests and expectations rather than convergence and mutual support . As a result , the companionship function of families comes under increasing stress . * Television and magazines create images of lifestyles , which may influence people 's expectations of each other and the roles of families * The anonymity of metropolitan life eliminates many of the social and community pressures on families . There are no watchful and all-knowing eyes in the big city that compare with those in smaller and more cohesive communities , where " What will the neighbors think ? " is a critical socializing factor . These forces will not wipe out the family or the commitment to family , but they will continue to reshape it . Implications of Stress on Family Functions : Substitutes for family functions will develop . As family members seek other sources of companionship , and nurturing children becomes less important in matured families , institutions will have a challenge and opportunity to meet human needs . Already , people are finding companionship and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and governments are all under more demand for meeting human services once provided in families , such as health and medical care , child care , retirement care , unemployment compensation , etc . Interest groups will proliferate . Support groups have burgeoned in recent years to help people with special health or emotional problems . Similarly , special-interest groups such as book-discussion salons , travel and adventure societies , or gourmet dinner circles could see a renaissance as individuals seek others with similar interests outside their own families . Photograph Couple considers condom use . Sexual behavior is increasingly separated from the family function of procreation . // " Recreational sex " may become more acceptable as the connection between sexual activity and childbearing diminishes . Greater access to information on health and " safe sex " will allow people-including the very young and the very old-to engage in sexual activity more safely , both physically and emotionally . TREND 2 Economics Drives Family Changes The greatest changes in families have to do less with the family structure and more with economics . The change richest in implications is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a way to go . Sweden and Denmark are the standards for mothers participating in the labor force . Sixty-five percent of U.S. mothers with children under age 18 are in the work force , compared with 86% in Denmark and 89% in Sweden . For children under 3 , the figures are 53% in the United States , 84% in Denmark , and 86% in Sweden . Among the significant patterns emerging are : * By 2000 , women will make up just under half of the work force . * Women are older when they marry and have their first child , deferring family formation until after they finish their education and get their first job . In 1988 , the median age of mothers of firstborn children was 26 , the oldest at any time in U.S. history . * Although the average income of the family household has stayed relatively flat over the last 15 years , the growth of the two-income household is allowing couples to make a higher average income . Implications of Changes in Family And Economics * Two incomes , two decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broader opportunities to start a new career or business initiative . Any change of job or relocation offer will thus affect two incomes rather than just one , making life/career planning doubly complicated . * Women disappear from the community . Women 's greater commitment to work means a long-term change in their commitment to home and the community . Like male breadwinners of the past , women may be rarely seen in stores , in their neighborhood , at home , and so on . In the shopping mall of the future , for instance , the only daytime customers may be the very old , the very young with their mothers or minders , and after-school teenagers . * A masculinization of the home will spread to the community . Telecommuting allows one or both breadwinners of the dual-income household to work at home . Many men are choosing this option in order to be more available for domestic responsibilities such as cooking , cleaning , and chauffeuring children to various activities . Men may also increasingly become involved in volunteer activities , especially those that directly benefit their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PTA . * An economy of convenience will emerge . A working lifestyle for most families will also continue to shape their preferences in eating , at home , for entertainment , and in shopping . Many families will be willing to pay a premium for convenience in all goods and services they purchase . TREND 3 Divorce Continues Divorce may be viewed as a way to correct social mistakes and incompatibility . In the 1940s , for example , there was a surge of marriage in the early 1940s as young Americans went off to war , and at the end of the war there was a surge of divorces in 1945-1947 , apparently correcting impetuous mistakes . There was an even greater surge in post-war marriages . // Enduring Family Values // Families in the U.S. Labor Force , 1940-1993 // Divorce is seen by many as the death knell of family values . On the other hand , a high divorce rate could be seen as a positive social indicator . It represents an unequivocal rejection of a bad marriage . For the first time anywhere in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wealth and prosperity , and the broad knowledge base to allow people previously trapped in lifelong misery to reject that state and search for a better marriage . The evidence is clear , since the majority of divorced people either remarry or would remarry were the opportunity available . Among the patterns emerging in divorce are : * Divorce rates fell below 10 per 1,000 married women between 1953 and 1964 , then surged to a high of almost 23 per 1,000 married women in 1978 . Divorces have continued at about 20 to 21 per 1,000 for the last decade . * Commitment to marriage continues , as demonstrated in the fact that the majority of divorced people remarry . Onethird of all marriages in 1988 were remarriages for one or both partners . The average time until remarriage is about two and a half years . * The shorter life-spans of many families has led to serial marriages . Almost surely there will continue to be people who have three , four , or five spouses , without any intervening widowhood . In the long term , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a pattern of later marriage , earlier sexual engagement , and much more careful and effective selection of life mates . Implications of Divorce Trends * Marriages and families will be businesses . Families may increasingly be treated as business units , which form legal partnerships and plan and evolve their own lifecycles as an integrated activity . Families may even incorporate to obtain tax and other benefits . Divorces will be handled as simple business or partnership dissolution . Ed. note : The rise of " families as businesses " was predicted by Lifestyles Editor David Pearce Snyder in his article , " The Corporate Family : A Look at a Proposed Social Invention , " THE FUTURIST , December 1976. * Teenage sex-but not pregnancy-will increase . Teenagers will observe and emulate their parents ' distinct separation of sexuality and commitment . * Companies will share and care . Businesses will offer their employees training in household economics and management , as well as family and divorce counseling . These courses could also be marketed as a service to the community . * Opportunities for marketing to new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top income segments will include remarriages and second and third families , in which the parents will have a strong incentive to tie together the new relationships . Aiming at this concern could offer opportunities . For example , a new blended family may want financial planning and related services to reallocate its resources . Club memberships for the new family , new homes , etc. , all could be important among this group . * A " pro-family " movement will take new directions . One of the most important underlying causes of divorce is that no institution in the United States-school , church , Boy Scouts , or other-teaches and trains people about what it is like to be married , to live in a two-income household , or to share and be involved in a new division of domestic labor . The search for a good marriage is not supported by the right tools to aid that search . Over the next decade , society will focus more on creating more-effective families . A new " pro-family " movement will encourage better and more effective matchmaking , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on economic and household management . TREND 4 Nontraditional Families Proliferate A variety of nontraditional family forms are evolving in the United States , shaped by economic and social changes . For example , higher expectations for education mean young people spend more years in the educational system and marry later . The greater tolerance of divorce and remarriage affects how often people dissolve and re-form families . Many people enter long-term cohabiting relationships before marriage . And many single-parent families are being formed among low- and middleincome communities , as a result of divorce , widowhood , or out-of-wedlock childbearing . The emerging patterns include : * More couples are cohabiting . In 1988 , one-third of all women aged 15-44 had been living in a cohabiting relationship at some point . * The number of " boomerang " families is increasing . Young people-post-high school or post-college children who would otherwise be on their own-are returning home to live with Mom and Dad . To a large extent , this is a money-saving move more commonly practiced by men than by women . // U.S. Divorce Rate , 1940-1992 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve matchmaking in order to strengthen marriages and families . // * Blended families are becoming the norm . Blended families result from divorced parents who remarry , either linking stepfamilies together or linking the children of one partner to the subsequent children of both . It is estimated that , for nearly 16% of children living with two parents in 1990 , one of those parents is a stepparent . * Technology is creating new families . These may involve adopted children matched for similar genetic inheritance , children from surrogate parents , and eventually children from cloned embryos . * Gay families are surfacing as a result of the new openness in society . Aside from the social approval so valuable to many in the gay community , acknowledgment offers substantial economic benefits in corporate or business health and recreation benefits packages . Time will make family resources available to members of nontraditional families . * Group living , with or without sexual intimacy , is likely to remain a transitional life stage for an increasing number of people , often as an alternative to living alone . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The unmarried woman who bears a child is one of these family styles . It is unclear what the consequences are for middleand professional-class mothers and children in these voluntary singleparent households . Evidence is strong that teenage childbearing , particularly by unmarried mothers , is socially destructive of the future well-being of both the mother and the child . Some single-parent families are single by divorce or separation . Implications of the Proliferation of Nontraditional Families Photograph Gay couple shares an intimate moment . Gay people will increasingly form families , demanding the same rights and benefits as traditional families . Photograph Gay couple shares an intimate moment . Gay people will increasingly form families , demanding the same rights and benefits as traditional families . // Changing Patterns of Marriage and Remarriage in the United States , 1970-1988 // Rearranged families will rearrange the workplace . The work force will continue to be profoundly affected by new family structures . The proliferation of family arrangements will create new pressures on employers to be flexible and responsive in relation to working hours . * Businesses will make attitude adjustments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family arrangement among their employees and not another . One company decided to offer benefits to gay couples because they could not get married and deny them to male-female couples living together because they could . Workers did not accept this justification . * " Nonfamily " families will gain in status . Many groups of people consider themselves families , even though they do not fit traditional definitions ( e.g. , gay couples , unmarried couples with or without children , foster parents , long-term housemates , etc . ) . This has implications for business and nonbusiness issues , for example in marketing , housing codes and covenants , loans , billing , leasing , and so on . * Family-oriented organizations will reinvent themselves . For example , Parent-Teacher Associations may broaden into Family-Teacher or Community-Teacher Associations . Schools may provide more counseling for students in nontraditional families . * Flexible architecture will be mandatory . Housing will become more flexible , with walls that can be easily taken down and rearranged to form new rooms depending on the needs of new family members . TREND 5 ln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades was the nuclear family : a working father , a homemaker mother , and children . As the children aged and left home , the traditional family was two adults with no children living at home ; then one or the other died , leaving an elderly single person alone . Aging creates a crisis in traditional families ' lifecycles . The patterns to watch now include : * Death rates of men are relatively high compared with women . Men also tend to marry women younger than themselves . As a result , at age 75 and older , 66% of men but only 24% of women are living with a spouse . At age 65 , for every 100 men there are 150 women . At age 85 , for every 100 men there are 260 women . * The savings rate among working adults is now just 4.1% of personal income , compared with 7.9% in 1980 ; this low rate bodes ill for Americans ' economic status in retirement . * Voting rates among seniors are traditionally higher than for younger people ( 60.7% of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16.5% for 18- to 20-year olds and 22.3% for 25 to 34-year olds ) . It is likely that the baby boomers ' influence on public policy will gain strength as they approach retirement years . Implications of Age and Family * The end of retirement ? A combination of several factors may lead to the end of retirement : the emotional need of seniors to feel useful when their families no longer demand their daily attention , the financial needs of seniors who did n't save enough during their working years , the improved mental and physical health of older people , and the need in businesses for skilled , experienced workers . * Economic priorities shift away from children . There is already concern among the elderly about balancing their economic assets against commitments to their children . Personal savings during their working years for their kids ' college education may have left them ill-prepared for retirement . * Parents will " boomerang " back to their kids . Just as adult children of the 1980s and 1990s moved back into their parents ' home for economic security , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the homes of their grown children . " Granny flats " and mother-in-law apartments will be common additions to houses . * 1o retirement from sex . The sexual experimentation characteristic of baby boomers ' youth may be brought to their old age . New drugs and therapies , such as penile implants , will help . * Elders will have roommates or form other shared-living arrangements . A substantial increase in cohabitation offers the benefits of companionship without compromising the individual 's financial survival or reducing the children 's inheritance . We may see some college campuses convert into retirement communities , with dorm-style living . The Effects of Population Changes on Values Changes in values in the United States will depend to some extent on demographic change . Social institutions will continue to be stressed when population groups such as the aging baby boomers pass through society . // Whom Children under Age 18 Live with , 1980-1990 // The baby boomers ' children , the echo generation , now number more than 80 million people ; they will be an even larger generation and a bigger social force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stress and reshape education , justice , and work in turn , beginning now and accelerating through 2005 , when they reach 20 and are ready to go to work . Through the 1990s , the young echo boomers will increase school enrollment , then college enrollment . As they reach their late teens and move into their violence-prone years , the United States could experience an increase in violent crimes after the turn of the century . At around the same time there may be some risk of social unrest either in universities or in cities , as the echo boom goes through its years of youthful idealism and discontent . The aging of the baby boom in the 1990s and 2000s may push the dominant values of U.S. society to be more conservative , more security conscious , and more mature and less driven by youthful expectations . In 2010 , the first of the baby boomers turn 65 . If the conservatism of their elders becomes repressive , the echo boomers could have more to rebel against . As the U.S. population grows , if the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views . At the same time , there may be an emerging social activism around worker rights , employment stability , and related issues . Effects of Shifting Family Patterns As a flexible institution , the family will continue to accommodate itself to the economy and the values of the Information Age . In many societies , this means an ongoing shift to dual-income partnerships . It has also meant a shift in what work is available for the family to earn its income-away from agriculture and manufacturing and to information and services . This shift has brought millions of women into the work force because the work now requires education rather than raw physical might-mind , not muscle . In many societies , men are finding it more difficult to find work unless they , too , can shift to information-based work . It is possible that women will become the higher wage earners in millions of families . It is also possible that as a result child care and family responsibilities will be more equally distributed between men and women . People will continue to want to be part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so will be less . For example , young people will need to spend more time in acquiring their education , and they will form their families later . Women with substantial careers will have less economic need to remarry after divorce . Education , prosperity , and a decline in regard for authority will continue to secularize U.S. society , but concern for the family and community will tend to promote ties with religion . The church will continue to be a source of support for those who feel in some way disadvantaged by current values and attitudes . The other attractions of religion are its rituals , its shared experiences , its mysteries , and its social events . These will continue to bring in and keep people in religious groups , unless urban society develops some alternatives . Conclusion : Belief in the Family Remains High Anticipations of family life have not diminished to a significant degree in the last decades . In general , Americans are committed to the family as the core of a successful life . It is particularly gratifying to see this view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshmen saying that raising a family is " essential " or " very important " has been fairly constant in the past quarter century : 67.5% in 1970 and 69.5% in 1990 . Adults ' commitment to the family has become somewhat tempered by the higher likelihood of divorce . But most people still agree that being happily married and having a happy family is an important goal . Photograph A widow grieves . Aging will create a crisis in traditional families as more women outlive their husbands . Many elderly people will seek new family options such as cohabitation .
