The Years Following WorId War II <p> Historian Frederick Lewis Allen , concluding his book on the first fifty years of the twentieth century in the United States , observed that there was an unrealistic fear of communism developing across the nation . He found a growing fear of change and the delusion that the nation was being overrun by communists . Allen warned about such fear : " It causes well-meaning people to imagine that anyone with unorthodox ideas must be suspect of subversive intent . It tends to cramp men 's imaginations into a timid conformity . It tends to constrict our generous impulses as people " ( Allen 1952 , p. 257 ) . <p> The national political climate that Allen described became an uneasy setting for educating young Americans for democracy . It evoked various demands for change in education and differing responses from educators . This article examines the professional literature written for and by social studies educators in the postwar era . Before analyzing the literature , it is necessary to provide background on the social-political climate in the United States forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At the conclusion of the Second World War in August of 1945 , there was a period of joy and celebration in the United States . By early 1946 , the United States had begun dismantling its vast military organization by discharging thousands of troops daily and cancelling industrial war contracts . Before long , the resulting oversupply of labor , decreases in production , and rising prices contributed to labor unrest and numerous strikes in the nation . Labor problems and inflation became the dominant domestic political issues of the late forties . <p> Bipartisan cooperation , characteristic of the war years , dissolved as Republicans organized to raise objections to the price controls , pro-labor policies , and high taxes that they complained were outcomes of Democratic President Harry Truman 's policies . Conservatism was on the rise in the nation , and in 1946 , Republicans won a majority in both houses of Congress for the first time since 1928 . A strong labor-control bill , the Taft-Hartley Act , was passed by Congress in 1947 over the veto of President Truman . The Republican Congress also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of taxes on higher incomes . <p> President Truman and Congress often disagreed about solutions to domestic problems , but on questions of foreign policy and national security , there was far greater accord . Problems with the Soviet Union had generated increasing hostility toward that wartime ally . It took a great deal of pressure in 1946 to get the Soviets to withdraw from Iran , which they had jointly occupied with the British . The Soviets also had armies in Germany and in all of eastern Europe except Yugoslavia . In 1946 , they were demanding a portion of Turkey and partial control of the Dardanelles . Winston Churchill , visiting the United States in 1946 , characterized the broad reach of Soviet forces from the Polish Baltic coast to the Adriatic Sea as " an iron curtain " across Europe and eloquently described the unfolding international " cold war . " <p> The president , the State Department , and Congress cooperated in developing a policy of containment , and , for the first time , the United States assumed a peacetime obligation to defend western Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of financial aid to Greece and Turkey ( the Truman Doctrine ) designed to help them resist aggression from " totalitarian regimes . " In April 1948 , Congress passed the European Recovery Act , which initiated a plan for massive economic assistance designed by Secretary of State George C. Marshall . Sixteen western European countries received twelve and one-half billion dollars in aid to help revitalize their economies and resist the advances of communism from within and without . <p> By 1949 , concerns about Soviet forces had not only generated further cooperative executive-congressional action for containment but had also strengthened the American commitment to military cooperation with western European countries through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . NATO had twelve members in 1949 , and by 1954 , there were fifteen members , including West Germany . NATO countries agreed to joint action if any member nation was attacked by the Soviet Union . By the early 1950s , the United States had made great strides toward military containment of Soviet communism in Europe , but as historian Eric Goldman ( 1956 , p. 97 ) noted : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from being contained , seemed a much greater , a much more insidious menace than ever before . " <p> The relief Americans sensed at the end of the Berlin blockade and from the formation of NATO was shattered when the cold war broke out in Asia . Although the Nationalist government led by General Chiang Kaishek had been given official recognition by all of the allies at the end of the war , Chinese communists in northern China had a large army and were gaining support from the masses of Chinese people . The United States had tried to assist Chiang throughout the forties , even to the point of establishing a coalition government with the communists . In 1949 , however , as Mao 's communist forces moved south from Manchuria , taking over large portions of the mainland , Chiang 's government fled to the island of Taiwan . The Soviet Union then gave diplomatic recognition to Mao 's government . The shocked American public learned that communists in China now controlled nearly one-fourth of the earth 's surface and more than a quarter of its people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of containment came in the autumn of 1949 when the president 's office announced that it had evidence of an atomic test explosion in the USSR . One Nobel Prize atomic researcher was quoted as saying , " There is only one thing worse than one nation having the atomic bomb  --  that 's two nations having it " ( Goldman 1956 , p. 100 ) . And so , as the fear of international communism grew , the American people became increasingly apprehensive of possible subversives in their own society and increasingly vulnerable to irresponsible accusations . <p> One politician took the leadership in voicing dangers of internal communism and spearheaded the anticommunist reaction . Joseph McCarthy , Republican senator from Wisconsin , intensified the fears of communist subversion and became a symbol of its chronic paranoia . He gained national press coverage in 1950 when he charged in a public address that at least fifty-seven people working in the U.S. Department of State were communists . Subsequently , he made similar charges about people in various agencies of government , claiming that the Truman administration was riddled with subversives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to substantiate his charges , and as a member of the Senate speaking in Senate committee hearings , he enjoyed immunity from lawsuits for slander . Although there had been some cases of Soviet espionage involving American communists , the number of such cases was few . He got wide press coverage , and much of the public responded with readiness to believe his wild charges . <p> For nearly five years , Senator McCarthy captured news headlines by making public his accusations of communists in the U.S. government . In 1951 , when General Douglas McArthur was relieved of his post in Asia for failing to follow orders and attempting to expand the war in Korea to China , he returned to the United States and added fuel to the fire by expounding a theory of conspiracy to explain events in Asia . McCarthy capitalized on the frustrations of the public over the stalemate in Korea and broadened his attacks to accuse university scholars , writers , and other intellectuals . Some consider that his attacks were aimed at the upper class , the privileged , the intellectuals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1955 ) . Other analysts of the period , however , view McCarthy 's attacks as a vendetta " against all departures from tradition in foreign policy , against the new , the adventurous , the questing in any field " ( Goldman 1959 , p. 213 ) . <p> Another factor in the subversive paranoia , particularly in the South , was the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka , which found that separate education facilities for blacks were " inherently unequal . " The decision shocked most white southern leaders and met with stiff opposition for years . Some white leaders viewed the Supreme Court 's decision as proof that there was communism in government . The court decision and white resistance in the deep South incited the mass civil-rights movement of the mid-fifties that persisted through the sixties and seventies . <p> A 1954 national Gallup poll indicated that 50 percent of American adults held a " favorable opinion " of McCarthy and only 29 percent had an " unfavorable " opinion of him ( Baker 1970 , p. 43 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to care that it was not against the law to be a communist , much less to have been one in the past " ( Bazelon 1964 ) . <p> After General Dwight Eisenhower became president in 1953 , McCarthy continued his charges even against his own political party 's administration . In Senate committee hearings that were televised for 36 days in 1954 , he focused his attack on the leadership in the U.S. Army . Television apparently contributed to McCarthy 's demise . He was particularly reckless in his accusations against the military , even implying that President Eisenhower was allowing treasonous acts in the Army . During the hearings , Army attorneys revealed that McCarthy had sought special treatment in the Army for a former member of his staff . Television coverage further revealed McCarthy 's loud , bullying behavior in contrast to the dignity and reason of the Army 's attorneys . <p> Utimately , he lost both public support and the backing of the right wing of the Republican party . In December 1954 , his Senate colleagues passed a resolution of condemnation of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped to create had presented a grave challenge to the basic freedoms of our democracy and stirred controversy about how to educate youth for democratic citizenship . The Educational Context <p> In the 1940s , the theoretical framework and terminology generally found in exchanges of professional educators had evolved from several decades of the progressive education movement . It was progressivism modified to practical , personal concerns . The modified progressivism in the postwar years is especially evident in the publications of the Educational Policy Commission of the National Education Association ( 1944,1952 ) , Education for All American Youth . These books offered recommendations and examples of how schools across the nation could meet the needs of young people from all social/economic levels . Throughout discussions of both urban and rural school programs , the commission reiterated three purposes for American education : personal development , vocational preparation , and civic responsibility and competence . The 1944 volume shows a heavy concern for the development of the individual in the elementary school and for guidance counseling in secondary schools to assist students in selecting careers , finding jobs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Council for the Social Studies ( Krug and Anderson 1944 ) is an example of the widespread solicitude felt nationally toward " individual differences , " " emotional factors , " and " life adjustment " in education . One chapter acclaims a high-school social studies program sensitive to student differences that used daily double periods to study " youth problems without reference to subject-matter boundaries . " The teacher describes how she determined student differences by checking personal data and home life , reviewing test scores , and watching for differences in " emotional factors " in the classroom . Students selected a personal " youth problem " to study ( such as vocations , recreation , health , or problems that might lead them to crime ) and were organized into committees to use drama , community activities , and other group methods . The objective was to help individual students gain social approval in their group and develop " life skills " that would make them better able to deal with personal problems . It was assumed that , ultimately , society would benefit as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " teaching children , not subjects , " and " adjusting the school to the child " were the educational catch-phrases of the times . A number of the original proponents of progressivism , including John Dewey , became disenchanted with the forties fixation on these bits and pieces from progressive education . The term life adjustment created particular problems because it seemed to imply that students should adjust to conditions around them , thus encouraging mediocrity . As educational historian Lawrence Cremin ( 1963 ) assessed the situation , the progressive education movement had lost its intellectual vitality and had failed to keep pace with changes in American society and its broader national needs . <p> In the early fifties , criticism of education and educators was increasing . By the mid-fifties , it had become widespread . Limited funds for new school buildings , rising enrollments as war babies entered elementary schools , industry 's call for a better-educated labor force , accelerating criticism of the shallowness of curriculum content by essentialist scholars , and public apprehensiveness over internal and external threats of communism  --  all contributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Social Studies <p> Social studies is especially sensitive to changes in the societal context . Not only were they affected by the conflicts in the education profession , social studies curriculum and instruction were also attacked by both paranoid patriots and disparaging essentialist intellectuals . To assess the tenor of social studies education in the postwar era and how its professionals responded to change , l turned to two key books , selected journal articles , and yearbooks of the National Council for Social Studies . I found that the social-political climate and widespread discontent with education gave rise to three differing approaches to reform in social studies . Citizenship Education to Ward Off Communism <p> Many political and educational leaders were convinced that the schools had to educate for " a divided world , " and that meant a special civic education that would impart the love of democracy while preventing the spread of communism in the United States and abroad . In one journal , an agitated professor wrote , " What we must insist upon is that our young people be educated to maintain the Western heritage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they prepare themselves physically , intellectually , and morally to defend it in whatever ways may be necessary . " He warned that the United States should not accept the idea of " one world " and thereby " surrender to the totalitarian fanatics and cynical careerists of the Kremlin " ( Keohan 1951 ) . <p> Extremist critics of education argued that progressive pedagogy and rising school taxes were linked with leftism and subversive plots that would lead to communist takeover of the United States . There were demands for patriotic assemblies in the schools and more " Americanism " in the civic education curriculum . Some educators sought to calm public fears by intensifying civic education with classroom recitation of the traits of a " good citizen . " Admonishing students in an authoritative manner , they sought to imbue them with democratic values . A 1951 article ( Karsch 1951 ) noted the promptness with which schools and colleges , in response to the " threat of totalitarianism , " were adjusting their curricula and guidance programs to add more social studies , particularly American history and government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public fear of communism were on the minds of the members of the Educational Policies Commission of NEA in 1952 . To avoid having Americans " succumb " to communist ideology , it proposed that the schools must foster loyalty in both teachers and students . American schools were described as " a bulwark against the danger of disloyalty , " and the teaching of loyalty was presented as one means to build feelings of nationalism and " civic competence . " Assuming that many young men would be called into military service , the commission urged that American values be taught well , not only because these young men would protect the nation " in both war and peace " but also because people of other countries judge the United States by its military forces abroad . The commission even considered the need to inculcate American values in young women , stating that " the struggle between democracy and totalitarianism involves active responsibilities for women . " <p> Numerous lists were prepared for citizenship education , partly to assure the public and partly to assure the profession that democratic citizenship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yearbook ( Carey 1951 ) reported advances in citizenship education on all fronts  --  the school curriculum , in colleges , in teacher education , and in curriculum projects . Among the lists were an appendix listing 135 behaviors and modes of thinking that characterized a good citizen , a list of journal articles on the topic , and a report of 1,700 organizations in the United States that were interested in citizenship education . <p> A publication of the American Association of School Administrators ( 1954 ) , Educating for American Citizenship , viewed the cold war as a " total threat . " They perceived the nation to be in an internal and international struggle over values with " imperialist Russian communism . " This total threat required special attention to citizenship education , which was vested with important new responsibilities to teach and defend the ideals of American society and to produce strong-minded Americans devoted to democracy . Although the volume encourages standard social studies approaches to citizenship education such as teaching concentric communities and problem-solving skills related to civic problems , teachers were reminded that stability and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The climate for education had become so oppressive with censorship and accusations that many teachers feared to teach . These pressures reached such alarming proportions that the Committee on Academic Freedom of NCSS ( 1956 ) was prompted to " oppose aggressively investigations that damage individual reputations and lower the morale of our teachers . " The published position statement made a professional commitment to national loyalty and delineated preventative measures as well as legal and professional actions in cases of unjustified attacks on teacher loyalty . Revitalizing the Interdisciplinary Social Problems Approach <p> For a number of social studies educators , the oppressive atmosphere of the McCarthy years increased their conviction that teaching critical thinking skills was fundamental in a democracy . They argued that the distinction must be made between indoctrination , which is the authoritarian method of social studies education , and reflective thinking , which is the democratic method . As one NCSS yearbook editor stated it , the task of social studies teachers is made " more vital and more difficult because of the struggle between freedom and slavery which is now going on " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to assist teachers and administrators in revising the social studies curriculum revealed the direction of change . The editors ( Ellsworth and Sand 1955 ) stated that " the frontiers of our present world are largely in the realm of the social sciences . " Throughout the 1950s , this professional movement sought to revitalize the instructional concepts of scientific method , reflective thinking , and interdisciplinary application of social sciences and history . Theoretical groundings were provided by teacher education books written in the mid-fifties . <p> One of the books , Teaching High School Social Studies : Problems in Reflective Thinking , ( Hunt and Metcalf 1955 ) was written , quite remarkably , during the peak of the accusations of communism and leftism in the schools . The authors stated directly that uncritical transmission of culture was inappropriate for educating democractic citizens . They argued that a democratic society requires citizens who can and will think critically about all issues  --  even those social and political issues that are considered " taboo " in the schools . This requirement places a responsibility on the teacher to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hunt and Metcalf 's theoretical framework , based on John Dewey 's works , proposes combining content and method of social sciences and history in application to important problems of the society . While the social sciences expand the frontier of reliable knowledge , it was envisioned that school social studies must teach students how to use that knowledge in making informed decisions on society 's problems . <p> Hunt and Metcalf also considered classroom climate and teaching style to be significant contributing factors to social studies education . Here they drew from Lewinian field theory and research . The authors viewed learning in the associationist tradition as suited only to totalitarian nations ; in a democratic society , open inquiry in a cooperative setting is needed . Thus , reflective thinking , although it relies on a given authority or framework , is ever critical and can challenge that authority in the process of seeking new knowledge . <p> Acknowledging that traditional social studies subjects , especially history , give people common knowledge and values , they insisted that for democratic values to be understood , learning must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include the " closed areas " or problem areas of American culture that often are characterized by public irrationality and dispute . Among the societal issues they discussed were social class , race and minority group relations , nationalism and patriotism , and power and law . It was their purpose to open these " closed areas , " the issues of great controversy in the society , to study and discussion in the schools and , as a result , to open " closed minds " to reflection and critical analysis . This they felt was the appropriate social studies education for a democratic society . <p> Another seminal work on the problem-solving approach in social studies in this postwar era was a book by Earl S. Johnson , Theory and Practice of the Social Studies ( 1956 ) . His thesis was that the main purpose of education in a democracy is the development of democratic character , a character of " goodness " and " wisdom . " Johnson , who was a professor of social sciences at the University of Chicago , was trained in sociology and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curriculum for a democratic society . He noted that political , economic , and social problems do not fit " into watertight compartments . " Wrote Johnson ; " No single body of subject matter based on any one of the single disciplines can give the student his world . " Therefore , knowledge of social science subjects must be synthesized to address matters of the modern society . The synthesis of separate subject matters would provide the means to study " what is general , common , repetitive , and pervasive in human experience " ( p. 102 ) . <p> Like Hunt and Metcalf , he was convinced that in the education of teachers the content of social studies could not be separated from the methods of instruction , and throughout the book he discussed them jointly . Likewise , he was concerned about classroom climate and called for a " therapeutic " learning environment in the social studies classroom . Every classroom should be viewed as a social system in which students can be assisted in developing skills , esteem , and internal discipline . Johnson defended original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real spirit of Dewey 's rationale , based on internal discipline , has been lost through overemphasis on Rousseauean notions of free development . <p> Johnson described his overall approach as the " social process approach , " taking into account needs of individuals " engaged in self-maintenance " and needs of the society " engaged in the maintenance of a social order . " Throughout his book , he is committed not only to educating for wisdom and moral responsibility in the character of individuals but also to the closely related objective of a humane and rational society wherein there is a " critical loyalty " to democracy . A Call for Teaching the Essentials <p> American intellectuals other than professional educators had become increasingly vocal in their criticism of the soundness and substance of education in the nation 's public schools . Among the academicians who wrote about the deficiencies of the schools and curriculum were Robert Hutchins , Paul Woodring , and Arthur Bestor . Bestor was , by far , the most effective voice calling for a return to the teaching of the essentials of the disciplines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Illinois , wrote two books and at least thirty magazine and journal articles criticizing American education throughout the 1950s . He was able to galvanize the discontent with the schools among American intellectuals and , ultimately , with the larger reading public . His numerous writings provided a probing , persistent , thoughtful evaluation of American education . <p> According to Bestor ( 1952 ) , public fears of communist infiltration in the schools were misguided . Rather , American education was being subverted by a lack of intellectual vigor and " a vanishing sense of purpose . " He decried the amorphous goal of " life adjustment " and " vocationalism " that he found in American education in the early fifties . As Bestor saw it , the original principles and practices of Deweyan progressivism had been watered down . School subjects had become overly concerned with the personal problems of adolescents , neglecting their intellectual development . <p> Education for democracy , he argued , must not be viewed as different from education in the essentials . Democracy could best be protected by providing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , mathematics , and foreign language  --  the education that once had been available only to an elite . Although not denying the need for student awareness of current public problems and civic affairs , Bestor insisted that the schools in a democracy must first aim for high intellectual competence and basic knowledge so that the public will be able to deal intelligently with public and personal problems . <p> Bestor assailed a trio of pedagogic professional groups  --  state departments of education , school administrators , and faculties of colleges of education . Referring to them as " educationists " who formed an " interlocking directorate , " he accused them of establishing and reinforcing standards for teacher education that heavily emphasized pedagogical methods and were very weak on content . They claim to have exclusive concern for good teaching , he wrote , yet they failed to encourage scholarship and critical thinking in the subjects the teachers were training to teach . As a result , Bestor found , anti-intellectualism had become the modus vivendi in the schools . Teachers had become so concerned about engaging student interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As a history professor , Bestor ( 1952,1955 ) took special interest in social studies . He abhorred the terms social studies and social education , however , and claimed that use of them contributed to confusion , vagueness , and failure to teach the social sciences and history with any rigor . <p> In Bestor 's analogy ( 1955 ) , history has about the same relationship to the social sciences that mathematics has to the natural sciences , providing them with powerful tools . Thus , he viewed history as an " indispensable complement " to the social sciences , balancing their contemporary focus with an examination of the past . He warned , however , that history must retain its separate identity in schools and its special perspectives and skills must be taught . Likewise , he was concerned that historians in the American Historical Association were not communicating directly with teachers but were dealing with school-curriculum and teacher-education questions through the National Council for the Social Studies , which , he claimed , neither protected the systematic teaching of history nor the teaching of the disciplines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis on personal social goals found in guidelines for social studies teachers . He singled out a book prepared for IIlinois teachers , titled The Schools and National Security , in which a section on teaching about World War II recommended that students study how dating patterns were affected by the war . He was equally negative about the ways in which social studies educators went about " educating for a changing world . " He supported the objective but criticized the heavy focus on current affairs as shallow and in need of historical perspective . <p> Overall , Bestor 's writings criticized social studies in the fifties , as a subject that had become a muddle of the disciplines , taught with excessive emphasis on contemporary problems , and trivialized by concerns for personal life adjustment  --  a result of progressive education gone awry . To reform the social studies , Bestor recommended that the disciplines of history and the social sciences be taught to sharpen powers of systematic thought . Only in these academic contexts could contemporary issues of democracy be fruitfully examined . Summary and Conclusions <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life adjustment " into the social studies gradually declined , especially in secondary education . In the late 1940s and through the mid 1950s , statements of the mission of social studies education shifted toward broader societal and international goals . Economic and political concerns of the postwar era , in particular , the cold war and competition with communist nations , and internal conflicts over national loyalty , led to the development of a number of interest groups with differing ideas about how public education must be reformed to better serve a democratic society . Several interpretations of the needs of democracy and how to meet those needs are found in the social studies literature . <p> One response developed as educators recoiled from accusations based on fears of national and international leftism . The group reverted to a reactionary notion of citizenship . The emphasis was on rote learning of civic duties and values and an uncritical commitment to lists of democratic precepts . Interest groups pressured school systems to assure that patriotism was taught throughout the curriculum . The prevalent secondary course structure was seventh grade , geography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninth grade , civics ; tenth grade , world history ; eleventh grade , American history ; and twelfth grade , problems of democracy . And these reformers did not require that this course structure be changed . Rather , they wanted nationalism to be stressed in existing courses . Censorship , accusations of disloyalty , and public pressures became so troublesome to teachers that many state and national organizations of social studies teachers formed committees to resist irrational interference . <p> A second social studies movement for change developed as an effort to bring back and strengthen earlier forms of progressivism in social studies by using interdisciplinary social studies to study the probblems of society . Its proponents called for social studies curriculum and instruction that would educate students for reflective , critical analysis about important social processes and the issues of the time . This approach to education for democracy apparently received its strongest support from teacher educators . Except for twelfth grade , however , it did not fit the prevailing course structure and would require significant changes in the secondary curriculum . Other obstacles to adoption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their lack of experience and training in methods of controversial issue analysis . In addition , it may have been difficult for the public to distinguish the personal-problems objectives , so heavily criticized by the intellectual community , from the broader societal problem-solving objectives introduced by Hunt and Metcalf , Johnson , and others . <p> Clearly , Americans were not satisfied with the effectiveness of public education in the United States in the postwar era , and , of course , that included social studies education . The reform of curriculum and instruction in social studies had been proposed , argued , and reargued for most of the 1950s . However , it was not until the late fifties that action for change was triggered . It took an international event to produce the public interest , competitive spirit , political impetus , and economic support needed to reform education . A tiny , beeping satellite , " Sputnik , " revealed that the USSR had the technological knowledge and skills to supersede the United States in space . Subsequently , the national desire to improve education became near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct : American education must have become lax . Greater rigor and greater emphasis on the disciplines of knowledge must be needed . Bestor and his supporters had influenced public opinion , creating the critical atmosphere that was sparked into a storm of change by the Soviet launching of Sputnik in 1957 . Reformers sought to develop social studies with greater rigor and emphasis on the disciplines of the social sciences and history . Theories of interdisciplinary instruction did not fade away however . The scientific study of social problems and social process and the open critical analysis of all types of public issues , ideas central to the curriculum proposals of Hunt and Metcalf and Johnson , were to have strong proponents within the stream of the new reform movement that would arise in the sixties . <p> Recalling difficulties they had in the early fifties preparing a teacher education book that dealt openly with issues of censorship and loyalty , Ehlers and Lee ( 1955,1959 ) exalted at the return , in the late fifties , of an open climate in education : " In a democratic society education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so much rule by majority , as a method of attaining majority through education , information and free communication . Unlike dictatorial forms of government , democracy has everything to gain and nothing to lose from the intelligence of its citizens " ( 1959 , p. 1 ) . In a more democratic atmosphere , school educators , academicians , and public leaders were regrouping to change education in history and the social sciences , heralding the beginnings of " the New Social Studies . " <p>
