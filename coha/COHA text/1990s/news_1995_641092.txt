<p> Columnist Chet Whye should reorder his priorities <p> The Denver Post printed a story on April 4 which described negotiations and an agreement between local representatives of the Rainbow Coalition and representatives of the Flagstar Corp. , which is doing business as Denny 's . <p> The story goes on to describe the fact that during the negotiations it was decided to request that Chief David Michaud recommend the dropping of charges against four of the six persons who had been arrested in a March 25 incident . <p> Chet Whye , chairman of the Public Safety Review Commission , contacted the chief and had another representative from the negotiating team ask him if he could have the charges dismissed . <p> The chief immediately informed this individual that he could not do this and that charges and plea arrangements are accomplished by the city attorney 's office with the concurrence of a judge . <p> The problem that arises here is that Whye , while assuming the role of negotiator for the protesters , participated in a process that placed the chief and the city in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at least should know after serving on the Public Safety Review Commission for several years , that police officers do not control the outcome of cases once they are filed with the prosecuting attorneys . <p> Whye , also a Denver Post columnist , is wearing many hats in service to his community . He needs to be extremely careful in assuring that his chosen causes and crusades do not overlap , thereby creating the ethical problems which are evident in this case . <p> Whye should reorder his priorities , decide which hat to wear and resign from either the Rainbow Coalition or the Public Safety Review Commission . My vote is that he opt for the latter . <p> ANTHONY J. LOMBARD <p> Denver <p> Low-risk groups should pay less for insurance <p> It has come to light recently that some insurance companies have declined coverage to battered women because they are perceived as higher insurance risks , presumably because of the medical and other costs involved . Protesters of the current policy argue that it is inherently unfair to penalize these women for the abuse they suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not intended to be a justice system , and we are sorely mistaken if we think we can make it one . The insurance scheme is one of documented risk-based cost apportionment , done with disregard to justice . Insurers survive by quantifying risk and assigning the costs associated with it . Age is just one example of how costs are apportioned with seeming inequity to members of that class . Just talk to teenagers ( or their parents ) regarding driver 's insurance premiums , or to the elderly about life and health insurance . <p> Such a system operates so that those ( the majority ) who are not high risks pay lower premiums . Generally alcoholics , drug addicts and obese persons are " risks " in the eyes of insurers . There is little debate that these people , like battered spouses , would benefit from adequate and affordable insurance . But please do n't ask me to pay higher rates so that these groups can enjoy reduced insurance premiums . I should enjoy the benefit of the healthy decisions I make .

This poster helps gay , lesbian , bisexual and questioning youth , their families and friends find a safe environment and accurate information so that they are free and empowered to find their own identity . <p> The letter written by Joy Overbeck clearly puts the kids first , which is an attitude that we encourage and share . Many people need more information about who gays , lesbians and bisexuals are , and what we do for them here at the Center . <p> We invite Joy Overbeck , teachers , parents , and anyone concerned for youth to visit us and learn about our services , our professional credentials , and the ongoing collaborations we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school districts around the state . <p> PETER CLARKE , President <p> CHERYL SCHWARTZ , Executive Director <p> BRAD JACKSON , Director <p> The Gay , Lesbian and Bixsexual Community Service Center of Colorado <p> Denver <p> Election can give charter schools a boost <p> An April 6 Denver Post editorial suggested charter schools should be helped by asking legislators to clarify the standards required for approval , and by reducing the power of the local school district and increasing the powers of the State Board of Education . <p> Instead of adding complexity to a well-written law , or stripping local districts of power because of the Denver School Board 's abuses , why not encourage use of the voting booth as the mechanism for change ? <p> Denver 's upcoming school board election is an excellent opportunity for the community to open the district 's door to charter schools . Three seats are up for election . Of the four remaining board members , only one ( Lynn Coleman ) consistently obstructs the innovation enabled by the state 's charter school law .

Charter schools are a tool for empowering educators and community members to make a difference . <p> DOUG MAY <p> Denver <p> Puerto Rico is part of U.S. <p> Again I am writing to criticize the location of an article about Puerto Rico . " Surgeons reattach chopped-off hands " March 29 was placed in The World section . It should have been in The Nation section , since Puerto Rico is part of the United States . The Jones Act of 1917 gave every person living on the island citizenship . Whoever handles your weather section places San Juan , Puerto Rico , under the three-day National forecast . <p> MIGUEL SEDA <p> Denver <p> Patrons bring in drinks , <p> and theater is suffering <p> I would like to protest a practice that I witnessed recently at the Buell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My family and I attend the opera , the symphony , productions at the Denver Center Theater Association , and were several weeks ago at a concert in the Auditorium Theater so we were surprised to see that the audience were allowed to bring drinks of all kinds ( beer , wine , mixed drinks , etc. ) into the theater . To my knowledge , drinks and beverages are not allowed beyond the lobby of any of the theaters mentioned above . <p> The Buell Theater is only about three years old , yet it already looks abused . The carpets and seats have stains and are looking worn - I believe this practice , which I understand is permitted for some other concerts as well , contributes to the wear and tear of this city-owned property . As we were leaving the theater we saw bottles lying on their sides in the aisles and broken wine glasses on the floor . Surely this is a policy that needs review . <p> JOANN R. PEAK <p> Denver <p> Keep PC-ness off TV <p> Joanne Ostrow 's April 3 column ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers who use television " to fight hate and bigotry . " She also commended " altruistic producers with ideals " who use entertainment as a vehicle to " expose prejudice . " Such is the power of treacle in the media that commentary like hers goes unchallenged . And that 's a problem ; reading it clogs the carotid arteries . It wants an antidote . <p> Ostrow 's idea that television should promote an orthodoxy of niceness has no more merit than it would have if Jimmy Swaggart or Fidel Castro used it . It is no defense of hate , bigotry and prejudice to insist that the business of entertainment is to entertain , not to propagandize . <p> In any case , it is not possible to reinvent human nature to conform to some socio-political theory . ( Ask the Russians . ) Hatred and violence will always be a part of life in every society whether it values freedom or not . The yammering of the politically correct is an actual challenge to individual freedom , but routine evil is not . We need to understand @
