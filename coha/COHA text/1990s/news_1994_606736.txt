<p> Rosa Lee Cunningham guided her 10-year-old grandson through the narrow aisles of the Oxon Hill thrift shop , past the crowded racks of secondhand pants and shirts , stopping finally at the row of children 's jackets and winter coats . <p> The boy picked out a mock flight jacket , with a big number on the back and a price tag stapled to the collar . <p> " If you want it , " Rosa Lee said , " then you 're going to have to help me get it . " <p> " Okay , grandmama , " the boy said nervously . " But do it in a way that I wo n't get caught . " <p> Like a skilled teacher instructing a new student , the 54-year-old Rosa Lee told the boy what to do . " Pretend you 're trying it on . Do n't look up ! Do n't look around ! Do n't laugh like it 's some kind of joke ! Just put it on . Let Grandma see how you look . " <p> The boy slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was too big . Rosa Lee whispered , " Now put the other one back on , over it . " She pushed down the new jacket 's collar so that it was hidden . <p> " What do I do now ? " the boy asked . <p> " Just walk on out the door , " Rosa Lee said . " It 's your coat . " <p> Four days later , Rosa Lee is recounting this episode for me , re-creating the dialogue by changing her voice to distinguish between herself and her grandson . It is January 1991 , and it has been five months since she agreed to let me spend time with her as part of a reporting project on how several generations of one Washington family have lived with poverty , crime and drug abuse . <p> By now , I have spent enough time with her that her shoplifting exploits no longer surprise me . One day before Christmas , Rosa Lee was searching for something in a large shopping bag in her bedroom and dumped the contents onto the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cologne and women 's perfume , as well as leather gloves with their $ 60 price tags still attached . She leaves the tags on when she sells the goods to prove that the merchandise is new . <p> " Did you get all this in one trip ? " I ask . <p> " Oh , no , " she says . " This is a couple of weeks ' worth . " <p> In Rosa Lee 's younger years especially , shoplifting was a major source of income , supplementing her welfare payments and the money she made during 15 years of waitressing at various nightclubs . She had eight children to feed and clothe ; stealing , she says , helped her to survive . Later on , when she became a heroin addict in the mid-1970s , she paid for her drug habit through her shoplifting . <p> She stole from clothing stores , drugstores , grocery stores , stuffing the items inside the torn liner of her winter coat or slipping them into the oversized black leather purse that she carries wherever she goes . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older brothers , Joe Louis Wright , joked with me one day that Rosa Lee " owned a piece " of Hecht 's and had put Lansburgh 's out of business . " Man , she would get coats , silk dresses , " he recalled . " She got me a mohair suit . Black . Three-piece . I do n't know how the hell she 'd get them out of there . " <p> Her stealing has caused divisions and hard feelings in her family , and is one reason why Rosa Lee has strained relationships with several of her brothers and sisters . They see Rosa Lee 's stealing as an extreme and unjustified reaction to their impoverished upbringing . Two of her six sons , Alvin and Eric , always have refused to participate in any of their mother 's illegal activities ; today , they are the only two of Rosa Lee 's eight children who do n't have prison records . <p> Rosa Lee has served eight short prison terms for various kinds of stealing during the past 40 years , dating to the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to steal a fur coat from a Maryland department store in 1965 . She says that she went to prison rehabilitation programs each time but that none had much of an effect on her . " I attended those programs so it would look good on my record when I went before the parole board , " she says . <p> Nothing seems to deter her from shoplifting , not even the specter of another jail term . On the day that she stole her grandson 's coat , she was awaiting sentencing in D.C. Superior Court after pleading guilty in November 1990 to stealing bedsheets from the downtown Hecht 's store . <p> " I 'm just trying to survive , " she says . <p> CHAPTER ONE <p> A Day in Court <p> Rosa Lee had chosen her clothes carefully when she appeared two months earlier before Commissioner John Treanor on Nov. 13 , 1990 . She wanted to look as poor as possible to draw his sympathy . <p> She had worn an ill-fitting winter coat , gray wool overalls and a white wool hat pulled back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dental plate , giving her a toothless look when she smiled . " My homey look , " she called it . " No lipstick . No earrings . No nothing ! " <p> Her lawyer 's statements that day matched her downtrodden look . Rosa Lee 's life was a mess , he told Treanor . She was addicted to heroin , a habit she had developed in 1975 . She had the HIV virus . She was caring for three grandchildren because their mother was in jail . <p> Rosa Lee told Treanor that she was trying hard to turn herself around . She was taking methadone every day to control her heroin addiction and had turned again to the church . " I got baptized Sunday , me and my three grandchildren , " she said , her voice breaking . " And I 'm asking you from the bottom of my heart , give me a chance to prove that I 'm taking my baptize seriously , ' cause I know I might not have much longer . " <p> Tears ran down her cheeks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she begged Treanor . " I know I have a long record . " <p> Rosa Lee was stretching the truth . Yes , she had been baptized , and yes , she was taking methadone . But no , she was n't caring for her grandchildren alone . Their mother 's jail term had ended several months earlier , and she had returned to Rosa Lee 's two-bedroom apartment to take care of the children , with help from Rosa Lee . <p> Treanor had n't seemed moved by Rosa Lee 's tearful performance . He glowered at her , and Rosa Lee braced for the lecture she knew was coming . Both had played these roles before . <p> " Every time you pump yourself full of drugs and spend money to do it , " he said , " you 're stealing from your grandchildren . You 're stealing food from their plates , clothes from their backs , and you 're certainly jeopardizing their future . You 're going to be one of the youngest dead grandmothers in town . And you 're going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out to some home or some junior village or someplace . " <p> That had been Rosa Lee 's opening . " Can I prove to you that my life has changed ? " <p> " Yeah , you can prove it to me , very simply , " Treanor answered . " You can stay away from dope . Now I 'll make a bargain with you . . . . You come back here the end of January and tell me what you 've been doing , and then we 'll think about it . But you 're looking at jail time . You 're looking at a cemetery . " <p> Rosa Lee had won . Stay out of trouble until January , Treanor had suggested , and she would stay out of jail . <p> Rosa Lee came over to me , her cheeks still tear-stained but her face aglow . <p> " Was I good ? " she asked . <p> " Yeah , " I said , startled at her boldness . <p> " Thank you , " she said , smiling . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Jan. 22 , 1991 , a transformed Rosa Lee stands before Treanor . She looks good . She has a clean report from the methadone clinic . She seems to have done everything Treanor has asked . <p> She usually dresses well , but I think she has outdone herself today : two-piece , white-and-gray cotton knit suit , tan leather boots , tan pocketbook . <p> " What would you like to say , Mrs. Cunningham ? " Treanor says . <p> " Well , your honor , I know I have n't been a good person . I know it , " she begins . <p> Treanor cuts her off . His demeanor is softer , his words more sympathetic than in November . " Wait a minute , now . Why do you say that ? . . . You 're taking care of those three grandchildren , is n't that right ? " <p> " Yes , sir , " Rosa Lee says , keeping up the pretense . <p> " All right , " he says . " Now you 've raised one family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir , " she says . <p> " Which is really too much to ask of anybody . So I do n't think you should sell yourself short . You 're doing the Lord 's work . Your daughter 's in jail for drugs , right ? " <p> " Yes , sir , " Rosa Lee says . <p> " And you have or have had a bad drug problem yourself . " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> Then Treanor launches into another lecture about drugs . He does n't ask Rosa Lee why she steals . " You steal to support your habit , " he says . " It 's as plain as the nose on your face . " <p> But it is n't that plain . Rosa Lee began stealing long before she became a drug addict . <p> Finally , Treanor announces his decision : no jail . Instead , he gives her a suspended sentence and one year of probation with drug counseling . <p> " Now , do n't you come back here , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts on a public mask , the way she wants the world to see her . She fudges a little , omits a little there , even when she is trying to be candid about her behavior . By her account , her stealing started when she was a teenager . It was an older brother , Ben Wright , who told me that Rosa Lee 's stealing started when she was 9 years old . Her target : the lunch money that her fourth-grade classmates at the District 's Giddings Elementary School kept in their desks . <p> " Jesus , Ben ! " Rosa Lee shouts when I ask her about it . <p> " What 's the matter ? " I say . " You said I could interview Ben . " <p> It is a late afternoon in January , not long after her court appearance . We are talking in my car , which is parked outside Rosa Lee 's apartment . We watch the teenage crack dealers come and go , making their rounds of the low-income housing complex in Washington Highlands , a Southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosa Lee 's grandson and granddaughter are playing nearby on a patch of dirt where the grass has been worn away . The sun is beginning to sink behind the buildings as she tells me about her first theft . <p> The year was 1946 , and Giddings 's imposing red-brick building at Third and G streets SE was a bustling part of the District 's then-segregated education system . The school , now an adult education center , served black children living in Capitol Hill neighborhoods ; some , like Rosa Lee , came from poor sharecropping families who had moved to Washington during the Depression , and they did not have the new clothes and spending money that their better-off classmates did . <p> Rosa Lee 's father , Earl Wright , was an alcoholic who worked for a paving contractor until drinking became the primary activity in his life . He died of liver disease just after Rosa Lee turned 12 . Her mother , Rosetta Lawrence Wright , brought in most of the family 's money , working as a domestic on Capitol Hill during the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , always for cash so the welfare officials would n't know about the additional income . They lived in a rented house in the 800 block of Third Street SE that had no electricity and no indoor toilets . <p> Other girls came to school with change to buy " brownie-thins "  --  penny-a-piece cookies that the Giddings teachers sold with the free milk at lunch . Rosa Lee 's family was too poor to spare even a few pennies . She knew it was wrong to steal from her classmates ' desks , she says . But she could n't stand being poor , either . <p> Rosa Lee soon found that she had plenty of opportunities to steal , if she were daring enough . Selling the Afro-American newspaper door-to-door on Tuesday and Thursday evenings during the summer of 1948 , when she was 11 , gave her a chance to slip into neighborhood row houses and rifle through the pocketbooks that women often left on their dining room tables . Washington was a safer place in those days , and Rosa Lee discovered that many families would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their back yards , trying to cool off on hot summer nights . <p> In the fall , she found a new source of money : the coatroom at Mount Joy Baptist Church , a nearby church where her family had worshiped for many years . She had started ushering during Sunday services and was assigned to help in the coatroom . She noticed congregation members often left money in their coat pockets . " I felt like if they wanted the money , they would n't have left it in their damn pocket , " she said . <p> Rosa Lee said she would wait until the " singing and praying " started before going to the racks of coats , patting the pockets and listening for the jingle of coins . Once in a great while she would find dollar bills . <p> Her coatroom thefts continued undetected until one Sunday , when Mount Joy 's minister , the Rev. Raymond M. Randall , announced to the astonished congregation that someone had stolen several dollars from a member 's coat pocket during the previous Sunday 's service . Randall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the thief was hungry , the minister said , the church would try to help . <p> Rosa Lee could not bring herself to confess in front of her mother , her family and her friends . " My mother would have KILLED ME ! Do you hear me ? KILLED ME ! " she shouted at me as she recalled the scene . " And who is going to go up there and tell him that you 're hungry ? That would only embarrass the hell out of you ! " <p> For the next few weeks , she stayed away from church . When she returned to her ushering duties , she was careful to steal only change . She often did not know what to do with the money she stole . Her immediate needs were small and simple : 35 cents for the Saturday movie matinee at the old Atlas Theater on H Street NE , or a dime for the snow cones that she loved . She gave away small amounts to brothers and sisters and friends , but never enough to attract her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her mother . " I would roll it up in a stocking , " she said , and put the stocking under a rug , or under her mattress or in her underwear . <p> Forty years later , Rosa Lee still hides her money every night  --  not from her mother , but from her five drug-addicted children . Sometimes she goes to bed with a wad of bills stuffed into her sock . " If I do n't hide it , they 'd steal it , " she said . <p> CHAPTER FOUR <p> Out of Style <p> If Rosa Lee felt bad about not having a few pennies to buy cookies in fourth grade , she felt even worse about not having a stylish wardrobe to match those of her friends in seventh grade . She hated the secondhand clothes that her mother bought for her ; they were almost always out of style . <p> Rosa Lee already felt at a disadvantage in attracting boys , and thought fashionable clothes might help . " I was dark-skinned , " she said . " I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boys always went for them . " <p> One morning , a girlfriend lent Rosa Lee a new gray skirt with " two pockets on the hip , " one of the newest fashions . " My mother would never buy me one , " Rosa Lee told me , her voice still smoldering with resentment . Rosa Lee loved how she looked in it . <p> During lunch , the girlfriend asked Rosa Lee in front of some classmates to share her 35-cent meal . " I would n't give it to her , " Rosa Lee said . " I was hungry ! " <p> The girlfriend blurted out , " I did n't say that when you borrowed my skirt ! " <p> Rosa Lee 's classmates howled with laughter at her embarrassment . As she retells the story , I can see that time has not healed her wound . Her voice hardens , her eyes narrow , her expression conveys the raw power of the memory . " That hurt , " Rosa Lee says . " I thought , ' God , this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later Rosa Lee walked into a five-and-dime store in the 600 block of Pennsylvania Avenue SE . She picked out a gray skirt and a white lace blouse , folded them into two tight bundles , slipped them under the skirt she was wearing and slowly made her way out of the store . As she turned the corner , she crushed the skirt and blouse to her chest in glee . <p> She hid the skirt and blouse from her mother . Emboldened , Rosa Lee branched out to other stores in the Capitol Hill area . " I was determined to have what other girls had , " she said . <p> At a party in early 1950 , she met a light-skinned boy who was attracting attention from the other girls . And Rosa Lee wanted to impress her friends by getting his attention ; she enjoyed the other girls ' envious looks when he asked to walk her home . <p> She thought having sex would cement their relationship . She became pregnant . " I have n't seen him since , " she said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her she would have to leave school until the baby was born . She never went back . In November 1950 , she gave birth to Bobby , naming him Robert Earl Wright . <p> Not long after Bobby was born , Rosa Lee decided to dress for church in one of her stolen outfits . She knew it was risky , but she was tired of wearing hand-me-downs when the other ushers usually came in stylish clothes . As soon as her mother spotted the gray pleated skirt , she confronted Rosa Lee . <p> " Where did you get this from ? " Rosetta demanded . <p> " I stole it out of a store . Please do n't make me take it back to the store , Momma ! " <p> Rosetta was furious . " I ai n't going to say nothing to you now because you told the truth , but do n't bring nothing else in here that you 've been stealing ! DO YOU HEAR ME ? " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " said Rosa Lee , trembling as she waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother just said : " Put it on . Let 's see what you look like in it . " <p> CHAPTER FIVE <p> The Stolen Scarf <p> Rosa Lee ignored Rosetta 's order to stop shoplifting . Whenever her mother questioned her about some new item , Rosa Lee just denied that she stole it . " My mother would tell me , ' Stop that lying , ' and then let it go , " Rosa Lee said . <p> But a judge was n't so kind when Rosa Lee was caught shoplifting a few months later at a downtown department store , her first arrest . He sent her to a facility for juveniles for 19 days in early 1951 . But the lesson seemed lost on the 15-year-old Rosa Lee ; after her release , she went right back to shoplifting . <p> When Rosa Lee was away , her mother cared for 1-year-old Bobby . Rosetta , who had her first child at age 15 in North Carolina , had accepted Rosa Lee 's first pregnancy , but she was angry because Rosa Lee was pregnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What do you think you doing , bringing all these babies in here ? " Rosa Lee remembers her mother saying . <p> Rosetta demanded that Rosa Lee have an abortion , but Rosa Lee was n't about to let her mother tell her what to do  --  about babies , or shoplifting , or anything else . <p> Anxious to win her mother 's affection , Rosa Lee decided to steal something for Rosetta . One day after Rosetta came home from work , Rosa Lee took a multicolored , cotton scarf from under her coat and handed it to her mother . <p> Rosetta took the scarf , turned it over in her hands and looked questioningly at her daughter . Rosa Lee waved both her hands , a sign to her mother not to ask where she had gotten the scarf . <p> Her mother did n't . " Rose , I NEVER had something like this ! " <p> Rosetta threw her arms around Rosa Lee . " She grabbed me , and I grabbed her , " Rosa Lee recalls . " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other stolen gifts that followed , did not bring Rosa Lee the close relationship that she wanted . Rosa Lee says her mother did n't like her shoplifting and continued to badger her about it . The tension between them was always there , waiting to explode . One day , when Rosa Lee was 22 and raising five children in an apartment next door to her mother 's , it did . <p> Rosa Lee and a neighbor had a shouting match after the neighbor had hit one of Rosa Lee 's children . When Rosetta heard about it , she was angry . She stormed into Rosa Lee 's home . <p> " She told me that all I am is a troublemaker , " Rosa Lee recalled . " I told her that the neighbor should n't have hit my child . Momma said , ' You nothing but a damn nuisance , ' and pow , right in my mouth . " <p> Rosetta 's blow left her daughter with one visible legacy of their relationship : an upper denture to replace the front teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting impression on Bobby , who saw the confrontation . He was 8 . " It was spooky , " he told me . " Ai n't nobody supposed to beat up Mom . As much as she went to get food for us and clothes for us . I do n't care who it was . " <p> CHAPTER SIX <p> ' We Started Grabbing ' <p> On the balmy Thursday night of April 4 , 1968 , a few hours after the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. , looting and arson erupted in several of the District 's major commercial corridors , overwhelming the city 's police force . <p> Rosa Lee watched as looters carried bags , boxes and portable televisions past the ramshackle house she was renting at 149 L St. SE . <p> " Where ya 'll get that stuff ? " Rosa Lee called out from her porch . <p> " H Street , " folks shouted . <p> Rosa Lee , 31 at the time , had a vague idea of King 's efforts to improve life for African Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did not believe the torching and trashing of businesses had any connection to her . The shops , she said , were run by " greedy " merchants who gouged customers and took " whatever little money I had . " <p> So when her son Bobby , then 17 , drove up in a Buick that Rosa Lee instinctively knew had been stolen , she did n't hesitate . <p> She turned to her seven other children and said , " All right ! Who wants to go ? " As usual , Alvin and Eric , then 15 and 12 , held back . <p> On H Street , Rosa Lee said , " everybody was grabbing everything they could get their hands on . We started grabbing too . Did n't know what we were taking . Just grabbing , grabbing , grabbing . " <p> The next day , when the looting began again , Rosa Lee kept her children at home . " We already had so much stuff , " she said . " There was no need to go out . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Rosa Lee says as I am driving her to her apartment in February 1991 , " stop at that High 's so I can get a loaf of bread . " <p> I glance at her , and she knows what I 'm thinking . " I 'm not doing any shoplifting , " she says . <p> I have told Rosa Lee that I can not be a party in any way to her shoplifting . So when we pull into the parking lot at High 's , she makes a big show of leaving her oversized black bag on the seat . Wallet in hand , she heads for the store . <p> Fifteen minutes go by . My feet are getting numb from the cold , so I decide to see why she 's taking so long . Her head is visible above the display counter of canned goods . She is putting something into a large brown paper bag , too busy to notice I 've come inside the small store . <p> " ROSA LEE ! " I shout . <p> She jumps at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the smudged glass door . She crumples the top of the bag and walks toward me . I feel her cold anger as she breezes past . <p> " That 's the last time I wait for you outside of a store ! " I yell as we walk to the car . " You told me you were n't going to steal anything ! " <p> She fires back , her words coming out in a steamy vapor from the cold . " I 'm trying to feed my family and I do n't have any money . We 're just trying to survive ! " <p> " That 's dead ! " I say . " Save that for the judges at Superior Court . You just threw away several hundred dollars buying dope and crack for your children . " <p> " You know so goddamn much ! " she snaps as I start the car . " I ought to go upside your head ! " <p> " You threaten ' to go upside my head ' every other day , " I say . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me what 's in her bag : a loaf of bread that she bought , and the items she stole  --  two cans of spray starch and a can of baked beans . <p> I am angry with Rosa Lee for violating my trust , and I am angry with myself . The incident is a lesson to me : Why did I think that she would behave differently around me ? <p> CHAPTER EIGHT <p> Second Thoughts <p> A few weeks after the shoplifting incident at High 's , Rosa Lee and I are talking in her apartment . After spending so much time with her , I realize I do n't always ask the questions that need to be asked . <p> " Rosa Lee , " I say , " there 's something I want to work out with you about how you look at the world . " <p> I remind her of the time she took her granddaughter to steal a coat . They were on their way to church , but Rosa Lee thought the girl 's coat looked ragged , so they went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " How do you put those two together ? " I say . " One Sunday going to church to be baptized , and the next Sunday going to shoplift a coat ? <p> " I do n't know , " she says . " I did n't like to take her to church with that dirty-looking coat . " <p> " But how do you take her out stealing then ? " I say . <p> She protests that the thrift shop 's white owner takes advantage of his customers , who are mostly black . " I do n't understand how a thrift shop can charge so much for things , " she says . " Do you know that he charges $ 8.95 for stuff that do n't cost that much brand-new ? " <p> " That 's a rationalization , and it does n't dance , " I say . <p> That night , I am surprised to find a message from Rosa Lee on my answering machine in the newsroom , telling me that she had had " second thoughts " about taking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You gave me something to think about , " she says . She told her grandchildren that our conversation had made her see that it was wrong to steal coats for them . <p> Her granddaughter immediately went to the closet and got the pink coat that Rosa Lee had helped her steal . <p> " What you want me to do with the coat ? " she asked Rosa Lee . <p> " Keep it . Keep the coat . But we 're not going to do any more stealing , " Rosa Lee replied . <p> " Are you going to stick to that ? " her granddaughter asked . <p> " So help me to God , " Rosa Lee said . " I 'm going to stick to that . " <p> Rosa Lee looks at me , waiting for my reaction . I study her face . She is n't promising never to shoplift again , only that she wo n't involve the children . Nonetheless , she seems sincere . <p> " You have a powerful influence on those children , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says .
