My personal odyssey through alternative therapies began innocently in the late 1970s at a summer picnic in Canaan , Conn . One of the guests , a New Age true believer , overheard me say I was convinced that coffee was making my hands feel clammy though my doctor had scoffed at the connection . " You 're allergic to caffeine , just like my husband , " she said , and cheerfully proceeded to predict a succession of problems that would eventually leave me a twitching wreck . O.K. , I said , irritated , but how would I stay awake to finish the book I was working on ? " Try beer , " offered another convert . " Drinking one every hour wo n't get you plastered , and it has a lot of protein and carbohydrates . " I nodded appreciatively : this was the kind of alternative diet I could live with . <P> The beer actually worked , but I gave it up because I got tired of explaining that I really was heading off to write as I departed each evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , the clamminess and poor concentration disappeared immediately when I gave up caffeine , and I discovered that fear of bill collectors is an adequate late-night stimulant . This first dip into the waters of alternative health left me open to the suggestion , a few years later , that I try chiropractic to treat my persistent lower-back pain . " Go see Christoph , " said one of my regular squash opponents . " He 'll give you a line of Eastern philosophy , but he knows bones . " Since I dreaded the doctor-recommended alternative of heavy pain- killers and two weeks of immobilization , I decided to risk it . <P> At first I found Christoph 's messianic zeal as off-putting as the detached manner of the doctor at my H.M.O. When Christoph checked my " energy centers , " my mind summoned up horror stories of patients crippled by chiropractic quacks . Deficiencies in my sixth ( or was it fifth ? ) " chakra " notwithstanding , once Christoph had finished his Procrustean pullings , crackings and pushings , the pain was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when not venturing into mysticism , Christoph offered a lucid explanation of the asymmetry in my hip that was causing muscles in my back and legs to tighten in compensation . At his recommendation , I gave up carrying my wallet in my back pocket . I returned at later dates with a banged-up shoulder and a stiff neck . Each time I left feeling improved , while politely agreeing to manage my chakras better . <P> As with chiropractic , I turned to acupuncture out of distaste for the recommended medical alternative . In 1983 I injured my knee in a wind-surfing accident . After scanning X rays , an emergency-room doctor immobilized my leg , gave me a pair of crutches and suggested surgery . Before going ahead , I decided to invest $60 and visit an elderly Chinese acupuncturist recommended by a decidedly non-New Age investment banker in New York City . I do not like needles , but I like surgery even less ; as it turned out , the worst of the experience was feeling a mild electric tingling . Forty minutes later , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the swelling had vanished . As I threw away my crutches , Sally Dan admonished me to avoid alcohol and sex for 24 hours .
