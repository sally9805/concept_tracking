OUR TECHNICAL EDITOR TELLS YOU HOW TO HAVE ALMOST AS MUCH FUN BUYING YOUR BIKE AS YOU WILL RIDING IT // In a recent news-talk show , a consumer advisor was taking calls from budget-minded listeners . She discussed washing machines , computers and automobiles . Her basic advice : Push for a discount no matter what you 're buying . Then came a call from a bike shopper who pointed out that , although he had tried hard to get dealers to haggle , no ont would budge on the price . The expert was stumped , and nipped the conversation short . This is typical of how little most people ( even supposed consumer experts ) know about the bike business . Fact is , selling bikes is n't like pitching stereos or vinyl siding . And visiting the shop is n't anything like a trip to your local discount house . Nonetheless , there are things you can do to ensure that you 'll be satisfied with your bike purchase , and here they are : Do your homework . Start by arming yourself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . They 'll have suggestions and might even recommend a bike for you . Do n't know any bikers ? Check out espresso joints on Sunday mornings-these are popular spots for cyclists . Few riders can resist talking about their bikes , and you can get excellent advice . 2 Pick a bike type . Narrowing your choice to one model can be daunting . Check out " Jim Langley 's Handy Dandy Flow Chart for Getting the Right Bike , " on page 56 , and then look over the bike categories that start on page 70 . Visit a shop and discuss your riding needs with a salesperson . A good shop employee will ask questions such as where you plan to ride , what you 're looking for from cycling , and your price range . Then-and this is the fun partthe salesperson should offer several different types of bikes for a test ride so you can feel the differences in position and ride quality . 3 Try a specialty shop . Some shops specialize in one type of bike , while others carry an assortment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended mountain bike ) , visit a dealer who 's made a name in mountain biking . Others specialize in road bikes , or family cycling . If you 're unsure about what you need , stick with a shop that carries many types of bikes . 4 Do n't expect discounts . Although you may find certain models on sale ( usually at season 's end ) , few shops can afford to slash prices . The reason ? The average mark-up on bikes stinks compared to that of almost every other retail business . Hidden costs reduce profits and force dealers to demand full retail price . For example , bikes must be assembled , usually come with free service after the sale , and have high shipping costs . These and other factors siphon from the bottom line until the dealer makes embarrassingly little on each unit . Of course , feel free to ask politely if it 's the best the dealer can do . But realize that demanding a discount may push the dealer 's hot buttons . A better option is to ask if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markup on these is better and some shops will work with you here . 5 Include accessories in your budget . Do n't buy a bike until you have some idea of the extra stuff you 'll need . ( Start by consulting " The Details " on page 60 . ) Are clipless pedals a " musthave " item for you ? Do you need a pump and repair kit ? Time for a new helmet ? These items add to the cost and you may not be satisfied with the new bike until you have them-so be prepared for the additional outlay . Ask lots of questions . It 's not uncommon for " all-knowing " salespeople to floor you with technical jargon that you do n't understand . But do n't simply pretend that you 're following right along , because they will assume you 're in the know and wo n't want to risk insult by talking down to you . So ask lots of questions . If they do n't have the patience to answer , go elsewhere . ( Want to be able to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 68 for a primer on frame materials , and " Component Counselor , " page 130 , for an overview of the 1999 component groups. ) 7 Take a test ride . This is the best way to judge a bike . Make sure the tires are fully inflated , the seat is adjusted properly ( see " Make It Fit , " page 64 ) , the suspension is tuned to your body weight , and the clipless pedals work for your shoes ( bring your own pedals if necessary ) . Also , wear your cycling clothes . Once on the road , shift and brake repeatedly . Climb and descend a hill , roll through some rough stuff , and work the shocks to feel the action . A short ride can tell you a lot ! 8 Check out the service department . How shops handle service after the sale makes a big difference when your bike is down . Most offer a 30-day checkup ( see " Repair Stand , " page 118 ) to check basic adjustments . Some offer free flatrepair for a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantees on the frame and components . A shop should be proud of its service capability , and eager to talk about it . 9 Do n't over shop . It 's common for someone to buy a bike simply because he or she is sick of shopping . But that 's OK , and here 's why : It 's hard to buy a bad bike from a bike shop ( versus a department store ) . You 'll find similar models with almost identical components in the same price range . So once you narrow your selection to a couple of good machines , it 's silly to keep shopping . If you need a deciding factor , let it be your feelings about the shop and its employees . 10 Leave the mailorder catalog at home . Nothing irks a dealer more than brandishing the latest discount catalog . The reason : They fear you 're going to monopolize their time researching your purchase , then buy via mailorder to save a few bucks . Tsk , tsk . Where are your manners ? <p>    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
