No one could ever blackmail Madonna . Indiscretions other stars would pay to suppress she is happy to exploit . A stormy marriage to Sean Penn , a brisk fling with Warren Beatty , the teasing hint of a tryst with Sandra Bernhard , MTV 's banning of the gender-blender Justify My Love video : no problem . Every fresh outrage is a soaring career move . Last week Madonna made the front page of the New York Daily News by giving a chatty-sassy interview to the gay biweekly The Advocate . She gets tabloid treatment  --  just as much as she wants  --  in slick magazines . New York , People , Vanity Fair , she 's done them all in the past month . And what has she done to earn this cover coverage ? She overexposed herself ( nothing new there ) . She took Michael Jackson to the Oscars ( Stop the presses ! ) . And she put together a docudrama of her 1990 Blond Ambition concert tour . <P> O.K. , this is news . Truth or Dare offers an ace manipulator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , raunchy and epically entertaining , this is pure , adulterated Madonna . Giving her all to simulated masturbation in the Like a Virgin number . Blithely stripping for the camera . Calling Beatty a wimp ( more or less ) because he is sensibly shy of her camera . Recalling some erotic nurse play with a childhood girlfriend . Gagging when Kevin Costner says her show was " neat . " Consummating an intimate relationship with a bottle of Vichy water . Two hours of dishing and dissing in relentless , bathroom-mirror closeup . <P> The film , directed by video phenom Alek Keshishian , trails Madonna through Japan , North America and Europe as she pursues her hobby ( rock star supreme ) and her full-time job ( do-it-yourself mythmaker ) . This is show biz , remember , where image elbows achievement out of the frame . Madonna knows this . She is the most self-aware , perhaps the sanest , of celebrities . So Truth or Dare does n't dwell on what she has done . We know she has done plenty , done well and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows us what Madonna thinks she is  --  and what she , driven by her acute instincts and awesome nerve , might next choose to be . <P> A great performer , for starters . More than Julia Roberts or Meryl Streep , Madonna is the modern movie star because she has created her own roles : boy toy , Marilyn Monroe avatar , Penthouse pinup , sly feminist , scandal magnet . With docile avidity , the world has eyed this procession of Madonnas , each one an incendiary variation on the last . The gag is that despite some fine screen work , she has never quite made it in Hollywood , a failure of the moguls , who have n't figured out how to channel her charisma . She is not one to wait for other people to do her a favor . So Truth or Dare serves as a kind of blueprint for alert auteurs . She says , in effect , " Here 's a Me  --  not the real me , not all of it , anyway , but a movie-marketable Madonna  --  that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me a hit . "
