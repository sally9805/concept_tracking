The Bush Administration may be making life easier for industries that pollute the air  --  but not for motorists . Though the White House last month issued an environmental regulation enabling businesses to sidestep provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act , the Environmental Protection Agency has now issued a rule that will enforce part of the same measure by requiring tougher emissions tests and more expensive repairs for car owners . <P> The proposed regulations , which become final in November , require 55 new urban areas to begin testing emissions from cars and light trucks by next July . That would bring to 177 the number of regions conducting such tests . And in about 80 metropolitan areas with the worst air problems  --  home to more than 60 million automobiles  --  the test will be made much tougher . The simple tail-pipe gauge that measures exhaust while the engine idles will be gone . The new test requires a high-tech treadmill device with the Jetson-ish name dynamometer . It collects exhaust while the car idles , accelerates and brakes . Then it runs the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of passing inspection are likely to fail . And not just old smokies : the EPA estimates that as many as a third of recent-model cars will flunk , instead of the current 8% to 10% . <P> The EPA had good reason to issue the new rules . More than 20 years after the government began requiring annual emissions tests for many cars , half of the smog and 90% of the carbon monoxide in the air still pours out of tail pipes ; the rest comes mainly from the smokestacks of factories and oil refineries . The new regulations could reduce smog-producing emissions and carbon monoxide pollution from vehicles by 30% in many cities . But repairs to pass the test could cost drivers from $25 to $450 , a stiff increase from the present average of $50 to $75 . ( Anyone whose car still ca n't make the grade even after an outlay of $450 will get a waiver until the next required test . ) Maybe that kind of expense would be less painful if industry were also paying its share .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
