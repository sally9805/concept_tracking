" This is not about me , " Ross Perot likes to say when asked if he will run for President again . As he tells it , his effort to establish a national Reform Party is about creating a vehicle to take the country to the promised land of balanced budgets , clean politics and democracy so pure that voters could veto tax hikes by referendum . Who would drive this bus to Utopia ? Well , Perot has been scouting for someone he describes as " George Washington II . " For months no one volunteered for that role . But now Richard Lamm , former Democratic Governor of Colorado , is auditioning , and Perot must decide whether to treat him as a protege or a threat . <P> Last week Perot maintained a studied silence while Lamm talked to anyone with a notebook or a microphone . " I 'm going to try to be the candidate , " he told TIME , but appended two huge , probably impossible conditions : that Perot " truly does n't want to run " and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Lamm nonetheless last week gave up his job as a Democratic TV commentator . And he plans to court potential delegates of the new party at state gatherings so he can become the nominee at the August convention . <P> Lamm 's dalliance with the Reform Party began with his appearance two weeks ago at its California conclave , where the audience devoured his assault on " generational malpractice . " Said he : " Without unpopular reforms ... the future of the American experiment stands in grave jeopardy . " His credentials make him a credible spokesman for Perot 's issues . During his 12 years in Colorado 's statehouse , Lamm was called Governor Gloom because of his warnings about the need to tame entitlement programs such as Medicare . <P> In the unstable world of third-party politics , many local centurions originally attracted to Perot have grown skeptical that he 's a suitable candidate . Unfortunately for Lamm , however , many of them now agree with Nicholas Sabatine of Pennsylvania , who as head of the National Patriot Party tried to woo several alternatives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't see anyone both willing and viable other than Perot , " he concluded after a year . <P> Perot , as he often does , is giving mixed signals about his intentions . When he met privately with Lamm and Lamm 's brother Tom , he was cryptic enough to send the siblings away with conflicting readings . Tom thought Perot could be taken at his word about preferring not to run . Richard saw a greater chance that Perot would seize the nomination .
