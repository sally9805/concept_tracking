<p> DEMOS IN CONGRESS MUST SHARE THE BLAME <p> Editor  --  When you see the new Democratic campaign ads on television talking about the Republican " Contract With America " as " echoes of a failed past , " remember that all those alleged " tax cuts for the rich , higher defense spending , and bloated deficits of the Reagan years " were passed by a Democrat- dominated Congress . <p> They led to a decade of economic expansion , the demise of the Soviet Union as an international military threat and the highest level of social spending in history  --  an unprecedented transfer of money from the rich ( taxpayers ) to the poor ( tax beneficiaries ) . <p> When a Democrat talks about " the failed past , " ask him , or her , exactly which part of the " failed past " he or she would propose to change . Preservation of the Soviet military threat ? Less social welfare spending ? Higher taxes ? Let me know if you get a straight answer . <p> RAY KRAFT <p> Roseville , Placer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion , your editorial applauding Judge Marilyn Patel 's gas chamber decision ( October 8 ) is an unfortunate mistake . <p> I wonder how long the people of this country will tolerate the judicial tyranny caused by federal circuit and district court judges . <p> These non-elected judicial busybodies intrude on nearly every governmental function carried on by elected officials and state and local legislative bodies . <p> In San Francisco , federal courts are running the police department , fire department , the jails and the public schools . <p> This judicial intrusion is perpetrated on the basis of so-called constitutional grounds , civil rights statutes and endless habeas corpus proceedings . Judge Patel simply substitutes her judgment as to what constitutes cruel and unusual punishment for that of the Legislature . <p> Federal judges appointed for life have abused the power of their office by imposing their personal opinions on many subjects , including the death penalty , and should be restrained by Congressional action . <p> CHARLES S.

As a very conservative , orthodox , fundamentalist , evangelical " born again " Christian , I am not at all bothered by the possibility that she may hold certain " unorthodox " views about the deity of Christ , because that is not the political problem at issue . <p> Like many other God-fearing Americans , I have been literally on my knees praying for the day that we would begin to elect people who will , in Mr. Huffington 's phrase , " send the whole rusted , cynical establishment tumbling down . " <p> I care not at all what the Huffingtons ' personal beliefs are . What matters is whether they are prepared to respect my beliefs . Liberals like Dianne Feinstein have a track record of despising my beliefs . So for me the choice is a no- brainer : Huffy baby all the way ! <p> JAMES SOLBAKKEN <p> Walnut Creek <p> SIERRA CLUB DEMOCRACY <p> Editor  --  We at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation of a healthy organization . The very day after the congressional vote that approved the California Desert Protection Act , one of our disgruntled members , Chad Hanson , ( Letters , October 10 ) charged , among other things , that the Sierra Club has supported legislation that would " remove current protections " from 4 million acres of pristine wilderness in Montana . This is misleading . These 4 million acres are currently unprotected . <p> The Montana Wilderness bill we supported would have protected a separate 2 million acres of wild land in this region as an interim step toward protection of the entire area . The Club also supported a larger bill , the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act , which would protect these 4 million acres and much more . <p> Mr. Hanson rejects this incremental approach . By his standards , the Sierra Club should also have rejected the California Desert Protection Act , because not every area deserving of protection was included ; the Alaska Lands Act because it left critical areas open to development ; and the legislation that created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire Colorado River . <p> Most of our members disagree with this " all or nothing " perspective . As a democratic organization , the Club will continue to be guided by the views of the majority of its members , while welcoming internal debate and dissent . <p> J. ROBERT COX <p> President , Sierra Club <p> San Francisco <p> WASTED HEALTH DOLLARS <p> Editor  --  The costs of Proposition 186 , providing a " single payer " system through which medical costs would be reimbursed on an equitable basis , will be formidable , but not necessarily substantially higher than what is now being disbursed through a multitude of payers , many of which take their profits off the top . <p> The added cost of providing for those not receiving appropriate health care might exceed the 25 percent to 30 percent of administrative costs now supporting nonmedical insurance personnel . But we could , at least , be certain that these dollars were going to medically appropriate uses . Millions of health dollars are also now wasted on uselessly duplicated , highly profitable technologies that need the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For those of us who would pay a slightly higher income tax , we will no longer be paying inflated insurance premiums and medical bills for catastrophic illnesses . The income tax increase would place more responsibility on those in the upper brackets better able to pay . <p> The payroll tax would also replace the escalating employee health premiums many firms now include as a cost of doing business . In every other " developed " nation , payroll health care assessments have been a fact of life for many years . <p> Proposition 186 also provides resources for retraining employees of health insurance firms , whose primary health responsibility is the limitation of medical care to their subscribers . <p> That the health commissioner might have a philosophy different from mine is a less daunting prospect than a situation in which life and death decisions are made by insurance executives whose bottom line is corporate profit . The commissioner will be responsible to me and the electorate . <p> The quality of medical resources in the United States is second to none .

What many people do not realize is that there is an alternative . <p> Mediation relies on an informal , face-to-face approach , fostering understanding and often leading to agreeable , long-term solutions . By not giving power away to an unknown judge , it keeps the parties involved in control of resolutions to their disputes . It also offers control over public exposure , time and costs and sets no legal precedent . <p> VOLKER HOEHNE <p> Arcata <p> CHANGE THE SUBJECT <p> Editor  --  Your article on penile enhancement surgery ( October 3 ) took up nearly a page . As a male , I am sick and tired of the attention the media focuses on this subject . I wish it would show the same respect to men as it seems to show to women . I am sure little research has been done on the size of the average woman 's genitalia . <p> Please show men the same decency you show women and spend more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARTZ <p> Novato
