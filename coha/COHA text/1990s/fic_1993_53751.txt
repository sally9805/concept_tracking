It was Labor Day , September 2 , a Monday , five years ago , and I was twenty-seven years old and about to bring my forty-four-year-old mother and my forty-four-year-old father together for the first time in my adult life . All my life I had daydreamed about this moment , wondered if it would ever happen , and now that it was about to happen , I was so emotional , I was almost out of control . The night before , my father had flown into Chicago from Boston , where he worked as a real estate broker . He was staying , like the last time , at his mother 's house . I drove down to his mother 's on Fifty-fifth and Indiana Avenue to pick him up . Mother Zoe  --  that 's what I call his mother , my grandmother  --  was sitting at the kitchen table with her cup of coffee when I knocked on the back door and there was my father  --  whom I had n't seen but once before  --  two years earlier when he came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brokers ' convention was being held in Chicago . He was slender and brown and handsome and wore a beard and was smiling at me as I came in . Apparently ready to go , he was already holding a tan summer jacket across his arm . I blushed and felt something like a current of electricity shoot through my body as I simply lowered my head , hiding my joy , and walked straight over to him and slid my arms under his and around his body  --  which fitted mine nicely  --  and hugged him for all I was worth . I knew I was going to cry . Tears were already rimming my eyes . All it would take was a blink . And I wanted my face over his shoulder , so I 'd be looking out the kitchen window , my back to Mother Zoe , when the tears came . But it did n't help and finally it did n't matter . I not only cried but I sobbed , sobbed with joy and pain and love for this man I 'd dreamed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was . Two years before , I had expected him to appear suddenly bigger than life , but when I came into Mother Zoe 's house that time and saw him sitting at the dining room table with his mother , with his elbows on the table , he seemed so small , so fragile , so frail , compared to the giant I 'd imagined . He was just a flesh and blood human being , a man , and one not especially imposing , just an ordinary man . But that time I did n't rush to him and hug him . I was too confused , too scared . He stood up and came to me and hugged me , put his arms around me and kissed my forehead . And , yes , that time , too , I cried . I cried but I pulled away in embarrassment , pulled back and went and sat down beside Mother Zoe , who patted me on my thigh . I was wearing jeans . I remember . Jeans and a blouse . And my curly hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . Before going down to Mother Zoe 's , I 'd tried on four different dresses and six pairs of shoes and finally rejected all of them and pulled on a pair of jeans and told my husband , Austin , " If my father ca n't accept me in jeans , then , then  --  " but I could n't finish the sentence . And I remember my husband  --  who , by the way , is ten years older than my father  --  saying , " Do n't worry . He 'll be happy to see you . " But , you know , I was never quite sure that he was . Something about him seemed guarded . I 'm still talking about that first time two years before . Sure , he hugged me but it was a stiff hug . Maybe he was nervous , too . Maybe it was simply that he did n't know what to expect and was maybe even a little bit scared of me . Yes , that 's what I felt . Felt that he was scared of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since , since . . . Well , actually , I do n't think he ever saw me after two or three . And I do n't remember him at all . I know from what Mother told me . They took him to court , you know . Tried to force him to marry or support her . But my mother , Pandora , was only sixteen . And my father , Barry Stanton , was exactly sixteen , too . Both of them still in high school . Messing around , they got me . And got themselves in a world of trouble . In fact , Mother got thrown out of school and Father joined the Army . Mother 's family said he ran away from his responsibility . That 's the way they saw it . But I was talking about that first time seeing him and comparing it to seeing him this time . And this time I just walked right over to him and put my arms around him and he did n't feel like a stranger anymore . And I had gotten this fantasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to size . I was just hugging my father , just a normal human being , a man , a handsome man with a face like mine . I could see myself in his face . Looking into his eyes , in a wonderfully strange way , gave me myself in a new way for the first time . I felt so close to him it was almost terrifying . When I hugged him I felt his heart beating against my breast and I held him close just to continue feeling his rhythm . Tears running down my cheeks , sobbing , I held him long and hard . But I started shaking and I pulled back and said , " I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry  --  " but I could n't bring myself to call him Daddy or Father . I also could n't call him Barry , just plain Barry . I did n't know what to call him . Anyway , the plan was he 'd have breakfast , no , brunch , with Pandora  --  his old high school girlfriend  --  and my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my six-year-old daughter , Octavia , and me . Mother Zoe was still in her bathrobe , with her gray hair kind of standing out every whichaway . And just as we were leaving Winona came down the hall into the kitchen and said , " Now , Ophelia , when are you bringing Barry back ? You know we got plans for this afternoon ? " And something in Winona 's tone offended me but I held back and refused to lash out although I wanted to . He was my father . I had spent twenty-seven years without him and here was his sister  --  who grew up with him , who had visited him more than once in Boston  --  telling me to cut my time with him short , bring him back , do n't hog his time . I got so pissed I could have screamed but I did n't . I just looked at Winona standing there in her bathrobe with the corners of her big pretty mouth turned up like she was expecting me to give her trouble . And Mother Zoe jumped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure hope you ai n't planning to have your mother over there . I told you not to invite her . Did n't I ? " And I could n't remember Mother Zoe making such a request or demand till she said , " Remember , I said , just you and Barry , quiet brunch together with you and your husband and your daughter . Just to get to know your father . " Then I remembered but I had n't taken her words to imply that Mother was n't to be invited . And anyway , what was this thing about , anyway ? Mother Zoe hated my mother from the beginning , from the time she came home from work unexpectedly and caught Mother and her son making love on the couch . Mother told me all about it . Mother Zoe drove her out , shouting at her , calling her a whore , a tramp , a cheap little bitch . No woman , Mother said , was ever good enough for Mother Zoe 's son . Mother said she thought he would turn into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But why now all these years later did I have to be the victim of this shit , the victim of these ill feelings that existed between Mother Zoe and sixteen-year-old Pandora Lowell years ago ? Why did the mess present itself just when I wanted more than anything in the world to bring my mother and father together and feel , for the first time , like I had a real family ? So , I did n't say anything . I just nodded . I assured Winona I 'd get her brother back before noon . And my father and I left . Octavia was waiting in the car in the back seat . And while we drove south  --  I live at Ninety-fifth and Yates  --  I had the warmest feeling listening to my father talking with my daughter . He was asking her about her school , about what she liked to do , and being the smart kid she was , she kept telling him about a spelling contest she 'd just won , and about her winning in the girl 's footrace , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off better this time than they had the first time when she was four . Back then she was n't really that interested in him . But now she had a great curiosity because she had been made to feel his importance . Some kids had grandfathers , others did n't . In a way , it had become very important to her in the last year or so to have a grandfather . Having one  --  at least at her school , Martin R. Delany School , the best private school on the South Side  --  was a status symbol , especially since so many kids there do n't . In fact , I had encouraged her to write to him in Boston and she did send him three or four letters but he answered only once , and only with a postcard . I had to reassure her that her grandfather loved her  --  though I did n't believe it , did n't even believe he loved me , his own daughter  --  and that he was simply too busy to spare time to write often . Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yvette , was in the kitchen working on the muffins . She makes great blueberry muffins . We could smell them the minute I turned off the motor and the smell got stronger as we walked up the back walkway from the garage , and while crossing the patio , I slid my arm around my father 's waist and hugged him to me . My father , I thought , my father , here with me . And I quickly kissed his cheek . And the minute we stepped up onto the back porch there was Mother sitting in one of the straw chairs waiting . And I thought of Mother Zoe and her warning and all I could hope was that my father would not tell . This was the moment . I had brought these two together for the first time since they were teenagers . I think the last time they saw each other was in a courtroom when they both were eighteen , and Mother was trying to get some money out of him , just before he joined the Army and disappeared . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for . This was my moment . The three of us stood there . Octavia walked between us into the house and into the kitchen , following the smell of blueberry muffins . I watched my father and Mother just looking at each other , looking fearfully . There was a distance of about five feet between them . He was trying to smile . God only knows what he was thinking . He did n't look happy to see her . In fact , he seemed a bit irritated . And she was giving him this cynical sideways look she can get . It 's a half sneer . I 've seen it all my life . Then she did something she no doubt thought was a smile but it really did n't come out right . It was more a grimace . But she sort of slung her string bean of a body over to him and for a split second I thought she was going to hug him , thought he was going to respond by hugging her , but that 's not what happened . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back and forth , and her mouth was twisted in an agonizing grin and her eyes were blazing with contempt , though she was trying to laugh and to be playful . I 'm sure she meant the gesture to be playful but it did n't come off that way at all . She yanked him too hard and he frowned and stepped back a couple of paces , pulling away from her . And she was saying , " What is this crap on your face ? " And he was beginning to sneer . I saw just the edge of his canine . An almost imperceptible shudder moved through his face  --  his cheeks and his chin especially , and his eyes , like her own , blazed . And I wondered why I myself was feeling so elated , so up , so complete  --  for the first time  --  and why at the same time everything was obviously going wrong . These two people , I could see , should never have been brought together . Not only did they not like each other , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known that to be the case I had n't wanted to know it . And it gave me for the first time in my life a clear sense of the emotional foundation of my life . But even then , sensing this then , I did n't want to face it , did n't want the full sense of it to reach my conscience . So I ignored it , pretended the hostility between them was not serious , not important , that , in fact , there was something deeper that held them together and that something was me , my presence in the world . Like it or not , I was their link . And I wanted them to like it . Oh , I so desperately wanted them to like it . So , grabbing Mother by the sleeve and my father by his elbow , I pulled them toward the kitchen , saying , " Come on , let 's see what 's cooking . " And in the kitchen there was my sister and my husband and my daughter . My sister turned around from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barry Stanton , and she reached out , smiling , and shook his hand . Yvette is a very pretty girl , with bright red full lips , yellowish green eyes , tall and slender with naturally reddish hair , a hair color unusual for a colored girl . ( People say we look alike . It 's because we both look like Mother , whose hair is also red . ) My sister was twenty-three then . And men were after her like crazy . In fact , she said , " I invited Robert over for brunch . Hope you guys do n't mind . " And though ! resented the liberty she 'd taken , I held back saying anything . Then my husband , Austin , standing in the doorway watching my father meet my sister , was smiling . Austin is such an elegant gentleman . He was nearing retirement , early retirement at that time . He was fifty-five and had been head of his own law firm , Tate , Jones and Bedford , on Seventy-third and Cottage Grove , for the last fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop work so he could go fishing when he felt like it , so he could be with his young daughter more and with me , too . Although he and I had n't been getting along all that well lately , I still respected and liked him . He was like a father to me . In fact , it 's true , he had raised me , in a way . Taught me a lot . As he put it , he had made a " lady " out of me , sent me to law school and given me a comfortable middle-class life in a good South Side neighborhood . I now had a position in his firm and I was holding my own . And after passing the bar last year I defended my first client in a civil case , a woman fighting for child support . I was saying , " Austin Tate , my husband , meet Barry Stanton , my father , " and I sounded awkward but the moment seemed grand to me and I felt that a certain formality was needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and gazing into each other 's eyes with tentative kindness . And at least their meeting was going well . Then Austin said , " Welcome to our home . How does it feel to be back in Chicago ? " and my father was saying something but I was no longer listening to him because Yvette was having an emergency with the omelettes she was making , breaking eggs into a big enamel bowl , she 'd come across a bad egg , and she 'd cried out as though bitten by a snake or as though she 'd burned her hand on the hot stove , and I turned to her to help . And Mother all this time stood in the doorway between the kitchen and the back porch watching , I sensed , with a lingering though slight expression of contempt . And Octavia ran her finger around in the blueberry batter bowl , then , with her eyes closed in bliss , licked the finger . And I said , " By the way , we 're eating out on the patio . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on out , " I said with a wave of the hand , " and get started , I want to get my camera , and show my father my office . " And I took him by the hand and pulled him up the hall , then up the narrow stair to the second floor where Austin 's and my and Octavia 's bedrooms were . And I led him into my little study at the back of the house . A place I was proud of . My law diploma was framed on the wall over my desk and I wanted him to see it . But I was n't planning to point his nose in that direction . But I did stand with my back to my desk  --  my camera was there on the desk  --  and took my father by both of his hands and pulled him to me , so that he would be facing  --  over my shoulders  --  the vivid evidence of my accomplishment . Three things I was proud of , this degree , my career , and my daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three accomplishments . So I pulled him against my belly and put my arms around him and held him close so that our bodies were breathing together . Thinking back on that moment I know it was a strange thing to do , but I felt so close to him , needed to be so close to him , and wanted him to feel what I was feeling . Touching him this way was the only way I knew how to reach him . Then I kissed him , fully on the mouth and forced my tongue into his mouth , kissed him the way I kissed my husband , kissed him deeply , so deeply he would have to feel how passionately I loved him , how deeply I felt for him , how much he meant to me . I held his head with one hand and held his back with the other and I lifted my stomach toward him and pressed harder and harder , and I felt him respond , felt his whole body come alive in my arms . Then I slowly let him go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I earned that all by myself . " And he took his glasses out of his jacket pocket and put them on and read the words , actually read the words , read them slowly , then he said , " I 'm very proud of you , Ophelia . " And I squeezed his hand . Then he said , " We have so much to talk about . I wish there was time  --  " and I said , " Now that we 've found each other , there will be endless time . I want to know everything , everything you 've ever felt and done , everything . " And while he looked a little embarrassed by my passion I picked up my camera and pulled him by the hand and we went downstairs and out to the patio where the others had gathered . Robert , Yvette 's boyfriend , had arrived . Robert was tall like Yvette , and good-looking with curly hair . He was standing there by Yvette at the table as she set out the plates . Mother and Octavia were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my father , Yvette and I brought out the various platters of eggs and bacon and muffins and , following us , Octavia brought out the jam tray and other miscellaneous condiments . Then Mother went in and got the pitcher of orange juice . Now Austin was in his natural place , at the head of the table . I sat down to his right , my usual place , and when I saw my father beginning to sit between Robert and Octavia , I said , " Oh , no you do n't . " And I patted the seat next to me . " You 're sitting right here next to me . " And everybody laughed and he came over and sat down beside me . Then I said , " Let 's all hold hands . " I took my father 's hand and my husband 's hand . We all held hands and closed our eyes . Then Austin said grace , a short , to-the-point prayer of gratitude . I glanced at Mother down the table and she was looking cheerier than before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of Octavia , saying , " Just take one at a time , now . Do n't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach . " And I remembered her saying those same words to me when I was a child and I had to choke back resentment . One thing I dreaded was her influence on Octavia . I felt that in many ways she had given me an unnecessarily hard time , had often struck me in rage for minor things , and had nagged me constantly when I was growing up . I felt in myself a tendency to treat Octavia this way and I was on guard all the time against the tendency . I meant to break the cycle . All the more reason why I was leery of Mother 's presence around Octavia . Anyway , this was a happy moment and I was n't going to let anything spoil it . I had put the camera down at the end of the table . Just before we started to eat , I looked down the table and said , " Robert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father and me together here like this at the table ? " And I could see everybody glancing at me , understanding my eagerness , and sympathizing with me . I was acting frantic , acting like I thought he was going to suddenly disappear and I 'd never see him again . And the fear was n't unfounded . So Robert , a sweetie , got the camera and stood up and went into a crouch and snapped the picture as I leaned closer to my father , my face cheek-to-cheek with his . Later , after brunch , we took more pictures . And before I knew it , it was eleven-thirty and I shouted , " Oh , Winona 's going to kill me ! We 've got to get you back ! " So I ran inside , grabbed my purse and car keys while my father shook hands with Austin and Mother and Robert and kissed my sister on the cheek . Octavia hopped in the back seat and we drove back down to Fifty-fifth and Indiana Avenue . Octavia waited in the car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes to twelve . Both Mother Zoe and Winona were dressed now and both were sitting at the kitchen table smoking cigarettes and drinking instant coffee . Giving me this severe look , her crazy look , the first thing Mother Zoe said to her son was " You have a nice time ? " and he said , " Yes , very nice . " And she wanted to know who else was there . And my heart stopped . I tell you , my heart literally stopped because I had forgotten her concern . I started to say something but could n't . Then my father said , " Oh , just Ophelia 's sister and her boyfriend . " And the relief I felt was obvious , maybe too obvious . I 'd been holding my breath , then I let it go . And it was then , for the first time , that I thought to ask my father how long he was planning to stay , and he said , " I 'm leaving in the morning , Ophelia . Got ta get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the buyer and the ' seller this time and it 's a very sensitive situation . But I 'm coming back when I can stay longer . Okay ? " But all I heard was him saying he had to leave and it caused something in me to cave in and I could n't hide my feelings . With all my might I tried not to start crying and shaking . Somehow I 'd thought he would be around at least a week . At least . I sighed and said , " Can I take you to the airport ? " But Winona answered for him , saying , " That 's all right , Ophelia . I 've already asked for the morning off so I can drive him out to O'Hare . " And I said , " Oh , I see . Then I guess this is the last time I 'll see you , at least for a while . Huh ? " I could feel the tears coming up again and I did n't want Winona and Mother Zoe to see me cry again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me and say goodbye to Octavia . Okay ? " And he followed me back out the back door , down through the backyard , out the gate , to the curb where Octavia was sitting at the wheel pretending to drive . By now I was shaking all over and tears were running down my cheeks and I did n't give a damn who knew it . I was miserable . He squatted down by the car door and spoke softly to Octavia for a minute or so , then stood up and I grabbed him and hugged him . I know I was being dramatic , too melodramatic . But I could n't help it . It was how I felt . I did n't know how to feel or be any other way . I held him like it was the last time I would ever see him . And , like I said , that was five years ago . <p> <p> <p> By CLARENCE MAJOR <p>                    @
