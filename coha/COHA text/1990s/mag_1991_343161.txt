If General Norman Schwarzkopf did not march into Kuwait City last week proclaiming " I have returned , " it was for two reasons . One was that he had never been driven out . The second was more important : the U.S. commander of Operation Desert Storm wanted the ravaged Arab capital to be liberated by Arabs  --  exiled Kuwaitis as well as Saudis and kindred units in the anti-Iraq coalition . So strongly did Schwarzkopf feel about dramatizing the Arab role that he was expected to pass up any uninvited triumphal visit to Kuwait . In 1944 a jut-jawed General Douglas MacArthur had made a point of being the ceremonial first to wade ashore in the recaptured Philippines . In 1991 Schwarzkopf remained at Desert Storm headquarters in Riyadh extolling his command 's " great coalition of people , all of whom did a fine job . " <P> Whether U.S. forces alone could have liberated Kuwait is an academic question . The fact is that from the outset of the Persian Gulf military buildup intended to thwart Iraq , a multinational effort was politically necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hussein , it was also meant to show that the Iraqi strongman was not the leader of an Arab-Muslim holy war against the infidel . That was the symbolism , a display of teamwork that skeptics thought would work only in an internationalist 's fantasy . In practice , however , the alliance moved as a smoothly coordinated machine during the stunningly triumphant 100-hour ground war . While U.S. forces were the backbone of the operation , its success relied on the nerve and muscle of a variety of nationalities . Lieut . General Peter de la Billiere , commander of British forces , called the alliance 's grand-slam performance " one of the greatest victories that we 've ever experienced , certainly in our lives and possibly in history . " <P> About half the combatants in the land campaign were non-American : mainly , in descending order of strength , Saudi , Egyptian , British , Syrian and French . The . small gulf sheikdoms  --  including Kuwait 's government-in-exile  --  fielded 11,500 troops with the Saudis , while lesser contingents from 17 other countries carried out some aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coalition members performed noncombat duties or tried , as the 1,700 Moroccan troops did , to stay invisible : their dispatch to Saudi Arabia had become a focus of controversy back home . But Schwarzkopf took pains to tip his forage cap to the chief partners , all of whose missions he termed " very , very tough . " <P> In the first hour of the ground war , two Saudi task forces launched an assault across the feared " Saddam line " of fortifications into eastern Kuwait . In the northward plunge along the coastline they had an unenviable double duty : to deceive Baghdad into thinking that all of the allies were massed for a frontal assault , and to deflect Iraqi defenders from U.S. Marine crossings farther west . The Saudi-led Arab forces " did a terrific job " in breaching " a very , very tough barrier system , " Schwarzkopf said , noting that they had been " required to fight the kind of fight that the Iraqis wanted them to . " Some Kuwaitis in the Saudi force kissed the earth on returning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in the vanguard entering Kuwait City .
