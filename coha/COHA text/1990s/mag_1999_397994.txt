EDUCATION The folly of mandatory high-school attendance . <p> In all the commentary on the murders at Columbine High School in Littleton , Colo. , an obvious question has gone unraised : Why , if Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were miserable at school , did n't they simply drop out ? Why did they feel trapped ? The answer is apparently that the stigma of dropping out of high school is so great in middle-class suburbs that it is unthinkable . <p> In all states , compulsory-attendance laws forbid students to drop out until they turn 16 and sometimes until they turn 18 or even older . States have also imposed penalties on dropouts and their families , including reduced welfare benefits . West Virginia began in 1988 to revoke the driver 's licenses of minors who drop out of school , and other states have since adopted this approach , even though it has had a negligible effect on the dropout rate in West Virginia . <p> Why is dropping out regarded as a terrible mistake ? First , it is assumed to be a personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high-school education is needed to avoid unemployment . The evidence about the comparative earnings of people with various levels of education seems to support this assumption . Second , it is assumed to be a social mistake . <p> Chester E. Finn Jr. , the education analyst and former Reagan-administration official , describes education as " something that a decently functioning society obliges people to get a certain amount of , even if they do n't really want to . " <p> But the case for coerced high-school education-so rarely questioned-really relies on ignoring certain facts and swallowing certain myths . First , the facts : <p> Fact 1 : Some students do not learn what school is supposed to teach them : reading and writing , history and geography , arithmetic and science . The reason may be lack of parental encouragement and help , which research has shown to be crucial in motivating children to learn ; it may be that students have physical or psychological handicaps ; it may be peer influences . Whatever the reasons , kids who do n't understand what is going on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They become internal dropouts , still enrolled but making no effort to learn . <p> Fact 2 : The presence of these internal dropouts discourages teachers . They often wear high-school teachers down to the point that the teachers stop putting forth the effort required to put ideas into the heads of students . One consequence of burnout is enormous teacher-turnover rates , especially in inner-city high schools with large proportions of internal dropouts . But some teachers hold on grimly , taking as many days off as they are entitled to , including " sick " days ( known in the trade as " mental-health " days ) . Of course , burned-out teachers lose effectiveness at teaching students who are in fact amenable to education ; that probably is part of the explanation for the greater satisfaction of students and their parents with secular private schools , parochial schools , and charter schools . <p> Fact 3 : Internal dropouts contribute disproportionately to fights and assaults , and probably to thefts , in public high schools . While occasional violence occurs in most schools , some schools in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , D.C. , suffer chronic violence as the internal dropouts multiply while the more serious students flee to private or parochial schools or a school system in the suburbs . <p> Fact 4 : In some other industrial countries where high-school enrollment is voluntary , not compulsory , a significant proportion of young people enroll and graduate . Japan is particularly noteworthy because its high schools are not only voluntary but a major expense . Yet a higher percentage of Japanese young people than American ones graduate from high school . The Japanese go to high school , and do much more homework than Americans , because they are convinced by their parents and the cultural values of their society that their futures depend on a good education . <p> The United States is surely not Japan , so we may not be able to convince as many of our young people to attend and graduate from school as the Japanese do . But persuasion is possible . We do not compel college attendance , yet the college-attendance rate in America is still the highest in the world . Making high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 10 percent of students currently enrolled in public high schools . The majority will do whatever they must to graduate . So why do most people shrink from the conclusion that compulsory high-school attendance is unnecessary ? On to the myths : <p> Myth 1 : Adolescents can be educated whether they like it or not . Actually , education in any meaningful sense depends on a cooperative relationship between teacher and student . Unmotivated students do not learn enough to justify the effort to keep them enrolled . Laurence Steinberg of Temple University , Bradford Brown of the University of Wisconsin , and Sandford Dornbusch of Stanford University conducted a study of 20,000 students in nine public high schools in Wisconsin and northern California from 1987 to 1990 . They concluded that about 40 percent of the students in these diverse educational settings ( suburban , rural , and inner-city ) were " disengaged " from the educational enterprise . Here is how Steinberg put it in his book Beyond the Classroom : <p> Disengaged students do only as much as it takes to avoid getting into trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are easily distracted during class , and expend little energy on in-school or out-of-school assignments . They have a jaded , often cavalier attitude toward education and its importance to their future success or personal development . <p> Myth 2 : The students who will leave school as soon as they can will generate a crime wave . Two studies exploded that myth a generation ago : a national study of adolescents conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan ( Dropping Out : Problem or Symptom ? ) and a study of California youths conducted by criminologists Delbert S. Elliot and Harwin L. Ross ( Delinquency and Dropout ) . Both studies followed students throughout their high-school years and beyond , gathering delinquency data covering the entire period . They independently reached the same conclusion : While it is true that high-school dropouts had a higher crime rate than other students , the higher delinquency rate preceded their dropping out of school and did not increase after they left . <p> Myth 3 : Those who do not complete high school are doomed to live an economically and culturally impoverished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How about flipping burgers for the minimum wage ? Fast-food restaurants have a reputation for offering dead-end jobs , yet they are actually a major trainer of the poorly educated for jobs that lead into the middle class . McDonald 's is more successful at training egocentric teenagers , including dropouts , to become good enough workers to move on to better jobs than most government training programs . <p> The surprising statistical finding of Dropping Out , which looked into the employment experiences of dropouts , is that on average they did at least as well as high-school graduates who did not go on to college . Formal education is not the only path to responsible adulthood . It should also be remembered that deciding not to complete high school is a revocable choice . The former governor of New Jersey , Jim Florio , dropped out of school at 17 , joined the Navy , realized that his lack of a diploma was a handicap , took the GED exam , and eventually completed college and law school . Instead of locking the high-school doors to prevent students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave know that the doors remain open should they wish to return . <p> The coercion of compulsory education has n't worked well for a simple reason : Some people do not learn to tolerate school , much less to like it . And some of them engage in desperate coping measures . There was little point in keeping Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold at Columbine High . <p> By JACKSON TOBY <p> <p> Mr. Toby is professor of sociology at Rutgers University and was director of the Institute for Criminological Research there from 1969 to 1994 . <p>
