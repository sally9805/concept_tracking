MAYBE IT WAS SHEER EXHAUSTION . The vast telecommunications bill had been lumbering through Congress for so long , tinkered with so many times , fought over by so many competing industry lobbyists that its passage last week  --  by an overwhelming margin in both the House and Senate  --  looked almost like a cry of surrender . How will the measure affect telephone service , cable TV , the networks ? Who wins and who loses ? Will consumers come out better or worse ? Never mind , Congress seemed to say , let 's just have done with it and see what the new world brings . <P> One thing is certain : it will bring changes as sweeping as any since the 1934 Communications Act , which established most of the ground rules by which the industry now plays . The new bill junks virtually all the federal regulations that have traditionally defined which companies can enter which communications businesses , setting up a free-market free-for-all . Local phone companies , for example , will no longer have a monopoly on providing phone service in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long-distance provider or gutsy entrepreneur  --  can enter the market as well . In return , the local Bells , once they face competition in their home market , will be allowed to compete against AT &T,; MCI and Sprint in the lucrative long-distance business . And any of these companies , technology permitting , will be able to cross over into the cable business to challenge systems that have long had an effective monopoly in their localities . <P> Though faced with the prospect of new phone-company rivals , cable companies had reason to cheer . Not only will they be allowed to venture into the local phone business , they will also be freed from any limit on how much they can charge for cable service . All federal rate caps ( removed by Congress in 1984 , only to be restored eight years later ) will be phased out in three years  --  sooner in smaller markets . <P> Broadcasters too found some bonuses in the bill . Until now , no company could own more than 12 TV stations reaching a maximum of 25% of U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no restriction on the number of stations . ( Caps on radio-station ownership will be removed entirely . ) Broadcasters dodged one bullet , at least temporarily , when Senator Bob Dole dropped his opposition to a provision awarding new spectrum space ( for digital broadcasting and other advanced technology ) to existing TV stations for free . Dole , joining many Democrats and consumer advocates , had argued that the valuable spectrum space should instead be auctioned . In a compromise , Dole won assurances that no spectrum space will be given away until Congress revisits the issue . <P> Deregulation is the bill 's calling card in nearly every area but one : protecting children from the alleged harmful effects of media exposure . To allay concerns about violent TV fare , the bill requires that new TV sets be equipped with a V-chip  --  a device that allows parents automatically to lock out programs labeled as high in violence . And computer pornography is targeted by a provision that sets criminal penalties for anyone caught sending indecent material over the Internet without ensuring that minors wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure as a violation of free speech and vowed to fight it in court .
