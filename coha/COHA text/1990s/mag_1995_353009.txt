Lieut . General Alexander Lebed was once an amateur boxer , and one might pity the opponents who succeeded in hitting him , for his head , with its ridgelike brow and thick , snubbed nose , looks literally , physically hard , almost as if the skin and hair covered marble . Lebed 's loud , deep voice also projects extraordinary strength  --  he can speak in thunderclaps . But when he was interviewed recently in Tiraspol by TIME Moscow bureau chief John Kohan and reporter Yuri Zarakhovich , Lebed 's manner was calm even as he denounced the windbags ' ' running the Russian army , proclaimed that the crackdown on Chechnya must have been ordered up by dilettantes or madmen ' ' and mused about running the country himself someday . I do n't really want to , ' ' he said , but I do not rule out the possibility that I might be forced to it out of necessity . ' ' <P> Generals in the Russian army do n't usually voice such opinions , but Lebed has made a habit of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one reason he has become a rising favorite among nationalists and the military . In a recent survey , some 70% of officers said they would prefer Lebed as Defense Minister instead of Pavel Grachev , who has botched the Chechen war and faces accusations of corruption . Lebed also appeals to centrists who detest both Yeltsin and ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky . If he could count on the support of all these groups , Lebed would make a very strong candidate in the presidential election scheduled for June 1996 . <P> Actions as well as words have earned him admiration . During the hard-liners ' attempted coup of 1991 , for example , he led a paratroop squad that protected Yeltsin 's headquarters , the White House . Tiraspol is the capital of Trans-Dniestr , a region of Moldova , one of the former Soviet republics . The inhabitants of Trans-Dniestr are largely Russian and Ukrainian , and for several years they have sought independence from Moldova . Lebed was sent to the region in 1992 to take command of the Fourteenth Army , and he intervened in the conflict between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiraspol overseeing a wary peace . <P> Doubts remain about Yeltsin 's ability to govern . He embarrassed himself at a summit meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Kazakhstan two weeks ago when he was unable to walk unassisted , but last week he competently delivered a speech to a joint session of the Russian parliament , in which he blamed the military for the heavy losses sustained in Chechnya . Still , his behavior remains erratic , the war continues , and some Russians are looking elsewhere for leadership . When one of Lebed 's aides was told that in Moscow the general was spoken of as a possible savior of the motherland , ' ' the aide quickly countered , What do you mean , possible ' ? It 's a fact . ' ' <P> TIME : How is reform faring in the army ? <P> Lebed : It is up to the state to do it , but there has been nothing but talk and wishful thinking . It 's like the tale of the emperor 's new clothes . Everyone acted as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was naked . This is where we stand with reform . <P> TIME : What will happen if things do n't improve ?
