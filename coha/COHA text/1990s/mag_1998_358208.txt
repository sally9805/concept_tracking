Picabo Street thinks fast , as if she were in a time zone all her own . It was about a year ago , when she was still falling through the air at about 70 m.p.h. , that she started planning for her comeback . She had been streaking along on a training run at Vail , Colo. , when she encountered a smooth spot where a speed bump had always been . " So I did n't have to make some real crappy turn like we usually do up there . I carved a fatty , " she says with some admiration for the slingshot turn that blew her off the fast track to Olympic gold . " That 's when I decided , when I saw where I was going to hit , that the potential for me to blow out both my knees right now is pretty high , so I 'd better just blow my left one out again . The surgeon can clean it up when he goes in there to fix it . " The crash went according to plan ; with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The damage-control maneuver , she explains , was just like jumping off a big roof . " You would n't try to land on both feet , you 'd kind of slide out of it . " Of course . Just like jumping off a roof . <P> Well , look out below . The ponytailed tomboy queen of the downhill is back , running on Picabo Standard Time . A human cannonball at 5 ft. 7 in. and 158 lbs. , she recovered from her injury about twice as fast as most people would have . But most people do n't have Olympic gold as the top item on their list of unfinished business . Street has lately zoomed close to her world-beating form , posting a fourth-place finish in a World Cup downhill at Cortina , Italy . But her comeback took a scary detour in a downhill last Saturday at Are , Sweden , when she crashed at about 75 m.p.h. and was knocked briefly unconscious . Afterward , coach Herwig Demschar proclaimed it " just a normal crash " and said the worst damage was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ron Street , predicted she would be fit for Nagano , despite a bad headache at the moment : " This will just make it more interesting . " <P> When Street won the silver at Lillehammer in 1994 , the freckle-faced 22-year-old instantly vaulted beyond the celebrity of any run-of-the-hill medalist , thanks to her peek-a-boo catchy name , a superabundance of personality and a mountain-hippie upbringing . During the next two years , she matured into a dominant athlete as well . She not only became the first American to win a World Cup downhill title but did it two years in a row . Now she 's rich too , from endorsement deals with the likes of Nike , United Airlines and Chap Stick . Her signature cross-training shoe , the Air Max Electrify , is scheduled to hit shelves this month . Her career dreams go even beyond all that : she aims to become a talk-show host . " Every time I watch Rosie O'Donnell , I think about it more , " she said last month as she waited to climb up on an awards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that with athletes so that the world can see all these powerful and funny personalities . " For Picabo , stage fright will not be an obstacle .
