WHEN I WAS A CHILD Of ten or eleven , there was a snail-slow freight train of a dozen cars or less that dragged its back legs through town each morning like a Sorry dog and even stopped momentarily for God knows what reason at the Arrow-Catcher depot and rested itself long enough to catch its breath and then , as if hopelessly , gathered its strength once again and set out on its asthmatic , straining , greasy , little diesel motion towards the Mississippi River , some forty miles west of where I lived . <p> This was the summer a man was executed in Greenville . And it was the year my grandfather lived with us  --  my blind , bitter grandfather , I need to say  --  and listened to St. Louis Cardinals baseball on a Philco radio as big as the Frigidaire . <p> One day that summer , after a night when the delta had been washed by a jungle rain and was a bright dark shallow sea stretched out between a hundred miles of overflowed rivers , I walked the short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and past the light plant and beneath the legs of the water tower , and I hid in the ditch down by the track where I knew the last freight car would rest when the train made its daily stop . There was no need to hide , no one would have seen me in any case , but I hid there in high wet grass and waited until the chuffy little sorry excuse for a train came to a stop and then caught its breath and made its first lurch and clatter and resumed its journey west . I pulled myself up the ditch bank by holding clumps of grass and wiped my hands on my pants and grabbed the ladder of a boxcar and swung myself up onto its first rung and held myself there as the train creaked forward out of the station . <p> I only rode through town , hanging onto the ladder , past the Old Dixie Cafe , past Mr. Wooten 's Shoe Shop , which stood on a block of stores with a wooden sidewalk , past the Quong Chong Fancy Gro. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five miles an hour , and if I had at any point let go of the ladder and dropped to the ground , I could have easily outrun the train to the apple orchard two hundred yards down the track , where I jumped clear and walked back home as the slimy little worm of a diesel and its spineless freight cars continued with threats of speed down the delta flatscape towards the river . <p> I did this a half dozen times that summer . And then one day , for what reason I can not say , something changed . I hooked the train , as I had done before . The delta was what it had always been  --  endless blue sky , defoliated fields , small African villages peopled with princes and savages and barebreasted sad women , washpots and collard greens . The train was what it had always been , so slow , so comfortable that it seemed to be stasis in motion . The poison heat of the diesel exhaust which swept back into my face was no different from the normal usual poisonous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DDT in the ditches and made up the staple air of my comfort and ease . Everything was the same . The train wagged its reluctant head and heaved itself up like an old man and set out with a wonted resignation toward the orchard where I usually jumped clear . Bark from the pulpwood on a flatcar was blowing in my face when I realized that I was not going to jump off . <p> I did n't jump . The apples on the trees called me to jump , but I did not . The train kept on , down the track , slow as a cow . My body relaxed . ! held on easily . I leaned out from the boxcar and looked ahead , down the track . The apple trees crept back behind me , their voices did not reach my ears , which were filled only with the bad-lung sounds of the train , which suddenly caused me to laugh like a happy person , a hopeful person , a person I realized I had never known myself to be . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well have been ringing Christmas bells inside my body , my insides were so alive with anxiety and joy . <p> The train eased into a bend and along a length of Panther Burn , a snaky stream with breaks of bamboo along the banks . It did not increase in speed , it only moved along the track . <p> I saw a dead dog alongside the railroad track and knew that this animal had committed suicide , there was no other explanation for how it could have been struck by this train . Farttier along , a flock of red-winged blackbirds stood pecking at something in the gravel one foot away from the track . ! could have jumped into the middle of them , they were so unaffected by our comical huffing and commotion . <p> I saw roadhouses I had never seen before , Leonard 's and Paradise Inn . I saw a woman beating a child . I saw an old man clogging on a bridge . I saw a horse with a blue bridle . I saw a jeep stuck in a field . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw lespedeza and wisteria . I saw cowbirds on a barbed wire fence . I saw empty wine bottles in the roadbed . The world was large and strange , and for the first time my eyes , which had never looked in any direction outside of Arrow-Catcher , Mississippi , could now suddenly see long distances . <p> The train kept on down the track . It even gained a little speed . It rocked like a dangerous cradle . I climbed up the ladder to the top of the boxcar . I stood and straddled my legs and let the train rock on . The train 's motion was my own motion . I walked a few steps along the moving car . At first I was stiff-legged and cautious , and then I walked with confidence . I danced a country-boy jig . I laughed my damn head off . Git on down the road ! <p> The train slowed then , five miles outside of Arrow-Catcher , and then it stopped at a little gray building , a tiny depot , with the word ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train knelt down with its tongue hanging out and heaved deep breaths and nursed a stitch in its side . Whoo , shit ! the little train seemed to say , a little too pleased with itself for its brief speed , as I scooted back down the ladder and headed back down the track five miles to my home in Arrow-Catcher . <p> Walking , I remembered the first time I ever heard the word equator , in a geography class . It was meaningless to me . But now the word took meaning . Geography made sense . The equator was an imaginary line that ran true as the Southern Railroad all the way around this incredible planet . It went through continents maybe , but mainly it went through small towns . It went through houses . It went through rooms , it caused climates . It connected every place to every other place , Roebuck Lake to the Amazon River . It ran through my grandfather 's room , which with the help of a space heater he kept as hot as the tropics . The slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year was cause enough to fire up his heater , even in summer . In my mind the equator was marked with railroad tracks and a roadbed littered with wine bottles and animal death . I walked until sweat popped out on my upper lip . I breathed the fragrance of red clover and Johnson grass and ripe figs . I watched four brown-and-white cows squeeze through a half-closed gate to stand in a ditch and bloat themselves on bitterweed . The equator was a dogleg of the Southern Railroad . The equator stretched all the way to Quito Station . Walking , walking , do n't give a flip ! <p> No one had missed me , of course . And when they saw me no one noticed that I had been transformed by imagination and the possibility of distances . <p> The danger of what I had just done was small  --  a fall from a height of a few feet at walking speed was less dangerous than a dozen risks I took every day of the summer . Often , with other boys my age , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water to test how far I could stick myself into the mud of the lake bottom . One boy actually hit a submerged boat and broke his back , and yet we jumped . But for all its benign aspect , my illicit ride on the Southern was not a secret I was likely to share with either my father or my mother or with anyone else who might actually understand what it meant to me . The danger of being chopped up by the wheels was meaningless . I was afraid my parents would understand the real danger , the great magnetism , the centrifugal pull away from everything familiar and true that I had ever known , the betrayals of a million kinds that suddenly were visible and possible and even likely for me and all of my sad family to play out against each other . I did n't want anyone to know what I was capable of , or what I knew each of them was capable of . <p> I would not tell my parents , but I considered telling my blind grandfather , who despised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shafts through the window of his room were as solid as pine planks . The delta was a steam bath , and my grandfather 's space heater was roaring like a log fire . My grandfather was dressed up , as always , in a suit and vest and silk ascot and a watch and fob chain as heavy as leg irons and sweating in the impossible heat like a man on death row . My grandfather believed he might sweat the blindness out of his system . The dark glasses that he wore to cover his affliction kept slipping down his oiled nose and he had to . push them up again with his forefinger . <p> As I came into my grandfather 's room the hypnotist was just giving up . My grandfather paid him , and he scurried away with big wet spots underneath the arms of his shirt . <p> Grandfather said , " He was more useless than the faith healer . " <p> I said , " I rode on the freight train . " <p> He said , " Musial just batted . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philco , which partly explained the hypnotist 's failure . <p> I said , " I jumped off at Quito Station . " <p> He said , " Tripled off the right field fence , but you missed it . You always miss it . " <p> I said , " I danced on a boxcar . " <p> He said , " Will dancing cure blindness ? " <p> I said , " It might . " <p> He said , " Go git me a Co-Cola . " <p> I said , " What time is it ? " <p> He pulled out his watch and checked it . He said , " I do n't know . I 'm blind . " <p> I said , " The equator is a railroad track . " <p> He said , " Go git me that Co-Cola . Acupuncture do n't work . Surgery do n't work . Power of positive thinking do n't work . " <p> I said , " Can I have a drink out of it ? " <p> He said , " Voodoo do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> I brought him a Coca-Cola and took a big swig before I handed it to him . <p> He said , " You slobbered all over it . " <p> I said , " Slobber might work . " <p> He said , " Do n't nothing work . Wo n't nothing cure blindness . " <p> I said , " Where does the train go when it leaves Quito Station ? " <p> He said , " Hush , Musial is about to bat . " <p> I said , " He just batted . " <p> He said , " Hush , he 's on deck . Stan the Man is in the batter 's circle . " <p> My failure as a baseball fan was a cause of my grandfather 's blindness and isolation . Musial batted every time I walked into the room . <p> Not this night but a night in the same summer , my family sat eating together , my mother 's nightmarish cooking before us . With the proper tools a patio could have been built from my mother 's rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid gravy , in which now soaked some substance in the shape of meat . The table was covered with a sheet of something we called oilcloth , and when my mother warned against spilling gravy on it , I took her warning seriously , having once heard the words chemical reaction . <p> I have to tell you that by the time we ate this miserable meal together the summer was already deep enough that ! had received a sign  --  from God , I supposed-and knew that my life was already changed . <p> It was August , and whatever it was that governed my solitude  --  rage , I think now  --  was disguised as comfort and familiar absences . Some days I rode the train across town . More often I only put my ear to the steel rail and listened to the solitary music as the train rolled onto the Runny-meade trestle . Once I put a penny on the track and let the train roll over it . When I found it again , the coin was a wafer the size and color of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a midget in the sideshow . <p> And then , one day , the Sign . Portable Justice arrived in Arrow-Catcher in a van that looked like the Bookmobile . <p> The electric chair was part of an exhibit sponsored by the State of Mississippi and hauled around to eighty-two county seats . It was happening , the State was telling us . The execution was real , A man would die in this incredible chair before Labor Day , and Mississippians were invited to lay eyes upon the instrument of his destruction . <p> I stood in the air-conditioned van with other children and adults and looked at the chair . The van was brightly lighted . There were framed pictures on the wails  --  the President , the governor . Even a framed news clipping of the first man ever put to death by electrocution , a New York Times article dated April 27 , 1898 . The man 's name was there , and even his picture , showing a starched collar and a silly smile . <p> The chair itself was as big as a roadside fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horrible throne of a chair . It was made of oak timbers , it had a seat wide enough for three condemned men , arms wide enough to rest a dinner plate on . There were two heavy-duty wires . One went to a steel beanie for the head , the other went to a steel cuff for the right calf . There were heavy leather straps that seemed darkened with sweat . Two straps came down from the top of the chair to hold the condemned man by the shoulders . There were straps for the wrists and the ankles and even a strap for the forehead . There was a heavy leather strap a foot wide that went across the condemned man 's waist . One of several high school boys looking at the exhibit said , " Buckle up for safety , " and the others snickered . <p> The exhibit guide was a thin man with a narrow nose and thin lips . He gave the high school boys an evil look . He seemed to say , " You go on acting like that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ! agreed with the look . I was silent and respectful . <p> The guide said , " The condemned man may choose anything he wishes for his last meal . " I thought , If he chose my mother 's rice , he would n't need to waste the electricity . I ' thought I would choose steak and french fries . Or maybe I would just ask for suggestions . <p> The guide said , " The top of the head is shaved . " He said , " The right calf is also shaved . " The high school boys said , " Woo-woo , " and pretended that sounded sexy . The weasely guide gave them another look and they shut up . The guide said , " A salt solution is applied to the shaved areas to insure perfect contact . " <p> Suddenly I said , " Can I sit in it ? " <p> The guide looked at me . He said , " Suit yourself , " and stood aside to allow me to sit down . <p> I looked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and afraid . I sat in the chair . Then I heard one of them say , " You 're sitting where many a grinning nigger died . " <p> It was that night that I was sitting at my parents ' table knowing that my life had changed . Maybe it had , maybe it had not . I thought it had . <p> My mother said , " More rice and gravy ? " Speaking to my father . <p> My father said , " Well , you bet . " My father loved my mother 's incredible cooking . <p> I said , " I do n't want none , Mama . " <p> My grandfather said , " Sugar do n't know what 's good . You go blind , you 'll appreciate good food . " He said , " I 'm hungry , I 'm so hungry I ca n't see straight . " <p> My mother said , " Hand me your plate , Pap . Some rice and gravy might help . " <p> I said , " I 'm taking the freight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Wo n't nothing help . Wo n't nothing cure blindness of the eyes . " <p> I said , " Mock it down . I 'm taking the freight train to see a man get the shock of his life . " <p> My father said , " They 's a blue smoke coming off this gravy . " <p> My mother said , " Spoon some over a slice of that Wonder Bread , you want a special treat . " <p> My grandfather said , " I do n't even remember the color blue , I been blind so long . " <p> I said , " It 's the color of sparks flying out of your nose when they pull the switch . " <p> My grandfather spooned the chemical fluid straight out of the gravy boat and into his mouth to break up a rice blockage in his throat . He said , " Getting rid of you might help . " <p> He said this beneath his breath , but he was fierce and serious and I heard him . <p> My mother said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Ten years old and still do n't know how to listen to the radio . " <p> I said , " Can I watch television ? " <p> My father said , " I do n't want you watching any colored people on that television . " <p> My grandfather said , " Sammy Davis is on tonight . I heard about it . " <p> My father said , " Better leave the tee-vee alone tonight , Sugar . " <p> My grandfather said , " If he knew how to listen to the radio he would n't have to watch a bunch of coons on the tee-vee . " <p> My mother said , " Now , Pap . " <p> I did not attend the execution , obviously . Even ! knew it was impossible . The man did die , though . His name was in the paper , not his picture , which meant he was a black man . I cried my guts out when I heard about it . Right in front of my father I turned on the television and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bill Bailey " and said , " She 's pretty . " My father left the room in disgust and got so drunk he had to be taken to the hospital to have his stomach pumped . I had always known he drank because of me , and for the first time I did n't care . I wished he would die , and then I cried my guts out about that , too . My mother said , " If anybody asks you , just say he got food poisoning . " My grandfather said , " If he was blind , he would have something to get drunk about . " I said , " If it was food poisoning going to kill him , he 'd been dead long time ago . " My mother looked at me like this . I looked right back and double-dog-dared her to say a word and she did n't . <p> Five years later , when I was in high school , Emmett Till was murdered in Money , right outside of Arrow-Catcher . Emmet Till was a black kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks to a white woman , he whistled at her , and the woman 's family tortured and killed him . In my mind all of it is connected . The electric chair , Sammy Davis , Jr. , Pearl Bailey , Emmett Till , the rice and gravy , blindness and hypnotism and voodoo and secrecy and all our unspeakable lives and loyalties . Years later I also knew the man who murdered Med-gat Evers , in Jackson . I once went to the movies with his niece , who called him Uncle Dee-Lay . I felt hopeless ever to live beyond this narrow grave of hatred that I called home , whose little high-school football team I cheered for , whose swamps and loblollies and cane breaks steamed like jungle pools , and great blue herons lifted off their waters like good things of the spirit . <p> You might as well know the end of this . What is the point of dragging it out ? I got up from the dinner table that night and left the house without speaking to anyone . I walked straight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a four-foot board , I swatted down a metallic-colored pigeon from the rafters and stomped it till its hard eyes popped out and pulled out all its feathers and stuffed them in my mouth and puked and swore I would never say , not even to condemn it as evil , the word " nigger " for the rest of my life . Today , for the one millionth time , as I tell this story , I am breaking that vow . I have no explanations . To seal the vow I pulled down from a corner of the church loft a wasp nest , papery and alive with terrified little red dive bombers , and squeezed the fiery nest in my hand until my hand was filled with poison and big as a football and I was stung many times all over my body . I also vowed to catch the train . This has no clear explanation either . I had been wearing a steel beanie and a steel cuff on my leg all my life . I had been eating my last meal forever , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm leaving , I 'm gone . <p> I slept in my bed that night and caught the train the next day and rode it forty hard miles . I was sick with fever from the wasp stings . My damaged hand glowed like a bulb . I could scarcely cling to the ladder of the boxcar . I could still taste pigeon feathers in my mouth and throat . <p> A thousand times , when the train slowed or stopped , I thought of jumping off . I wanted to die in a ditch . I wanted to disappear . I wanted a different history and geography . In rhythm with the wheels I said , I want I want I want I want . I stayed on the train . I breathed the hot exhaust from the diesel . I clung with my one good hand to the ladder and a part of me dreamed a joyful waking dream of falling beneath the wheels . Once , at a cattle crossing , where the train slowed , two children threw rocks at me , and one of the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopelessness caused by that lucky shot was inseparable from my father 's drunkenness and the big Philco and Stan the Man . I yelled at the children , " Niggeral " The train slogged on down the line . I yelled , " You could put somebody 's eye out ! " I laughed my damn head off when I heard myself say this . I sounded just like my mother . I thought of my blind grandfather and Sammy Davis , Jr . I was a sick and bitter child . <p> Later that day , delirious with fever and loss , I stepped off the train into a cinder lot in sight of the Mississippi River . I did not even look at the river . I had escaped nothing , proved nothing . I walked far across the trainyard until I came to a warehouse with baggage carts parked beside it . Under one of the carts was a black man having an epileptic seizure . It lasted a long time , and all I knew to do was stand and watch . I had never heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I actually thought for one second that I was at home in my bed having a nightmare about living in the house with my family . When the seizure ended the man slept and snored and finally woke up and sat up for a while with his face in his hands . At last he struggled to his knees and then to his feet , and set out across the lot with a slow and wobbly gait . Behind him I called , " I 'm sorry ! " I sat down where he had been sitting , under the baggage cart . I thought of the long black train . I thought of bean fields and rice paddies and buckshot and gumbo . I lay down and believed that I would die . I suffered chills and fever , and I slept two hours of black sleep before I woke , feeling better . <p> And now here is a strange thing . In fact , it 's the strangest thing I know of . <p> When I woke up , no one was nearby . The cinder lot was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered the seizure , but he was gone , of course . I walked out of the railroad yard and down long sad streets of shanties . I lost sight of the big river . <p> I came to a small cafe with a sign that said REGAL . It was owned by a skinny white-trash man with a big Adam 's apple and a yellow dog . <p> The man looked at me . I was black with cinders and train filth . The man let me use the telephone . <p> I said , " Mama ? " <p> My mother said , " Sugar ? " <p> I said , " I 'm filthy and I 'm hungry and I 'm sick and I want to die . I watched a man have a fit . " <p> My mother said , " Sugar-man , your grandfather can see ! It 's a miracle . " <p> I said , " I 'm in Greenville . Can you come get me ? " <p> She said , " Of course we can , Sugar-man , but are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer blind and now can see . It 's like the Bible . " <p> I said , " Something worked . " <p> My mother said , " I think it 's love . Love is always the answer . " <p> The white-trash man with the yellow dog said , " I would n't want to rush you , son , but like the poet said , ' Time is money . ' " <p> I hung up and said , " My grandfather 's sight came back . He was blind until today . " <p> The white-trash man took a big handful of the skin of the dog 's back in his hand and gave it a couple of good yanks . The dog looked back over its shoulder at the man , lovingly , and the man yanked the dog 's skin again . The man said , " Your granddaddy ai n't the first white man to get cured for spite . " <p> I said , " He 'll have to learn how to watch television . " <p> The white-trash man said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " He said , " Do n't be touching my dog , I would n't want it to catch nothing . " This was a joke , so we both laughed . The yellow dog ambled over to me , and so I sat in a chair and gathered the dog 's skin into my good hand and gave it a few good yanks . <p> I said , " So you 're saying spite works ? " <p> The white-trash man said , " You bet . Spite works when nothing else wo n't . " <p> The white-trash man gave me two big gulps out of a bottle of sweet wine and so I felt better . I thought of the train . The train ride seemed to have taken place in another life . I thought of the crossing signals . I thought of the arms of the semaphore . I thought of the mileposts . I thought of the click of the rails , the jingle of the wheels . I thought of the many little stations I had passed  --  Quito , and Colony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women in head rags picking wild fruit into clean lard buckets along the tracks . When I thought of these things , with the red wine in my stomach and the yellow dog beneath my hand , I was a happy child and the world was a place of safety and peace . <p> There is one more thing to tell . Many days later , when my illness was coming to an end and the bandages were removed from my infected hand , I was lying in bed between clean sheets and with my head on two fluffed-up pillows my mother had put there , my grandfather , who now could see , came into my room and sat in a chair beside my bed . He had never done such a thing before . <p> Then he moved from the chair and actually sat on the bed itself , . right beside me . I have to tell you , I was frightened .
