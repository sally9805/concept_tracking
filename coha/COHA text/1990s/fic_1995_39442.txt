Alberto Perera , librarian , granted no credibility to police profiles of dangerous persons . Writers , down through the centuries , had that look of being up to no good and were often mistaken for smugglers , assassins , fugitives from justice  --  criminals of all sorts . But the young man invading his sanctum , hands hidden in the pockets of his badly soiled green parka , could possibly be another lunatic out to kill another librarian . Up in Sacramento , two librarians were shot dead while on duty , and , down in Los Angeles , the main library was sent up in flames by an arsonist . Perera loved life and wished to participate in it further . <p> " You got a minute ? " <p> " I do not . " <p> " Can I read you something ? " <p> " Please do n't .

" Take your time but not in here Watch your step with anybody playing dumb , Perera cautioned himself . They sneak up on you from behind . This fellow knew just what he was doing , pulling out a poem by Ruben Dario , reading it aloud to a librarian so proud of his Spanish ancestry he kept the name his dear mother had called him , Alberto , and there it was , his foreign name in a narrow frame on his desk for all who passed his open door to see .

" <p> Out in fistfuls from his parka pockets , more scraps of paper . So many , some fluttered to the floor . Cigarette packets inside out , gum wrappers , scavenged street papers of many colors that were slipped along underfoot by the winds of traffic , scraps that became transcendentally unfamiliar by the use they 'd been put to : lines of poetry in a fixatedly careful , cramped handwriting . <p> " That spider , you take that spider .

" <p> " When they 're on their own ? " A cough , probably incited by some highly pleasurable secret excitement from tormenting a librarian . " What I know about bears , " answering himself before his cough was over , " is bears do not dance . It is not in their genetic code . I 'll tell you when they dance . They dance when they got <p> rope around their neck . That poet slipped up there . A bear with <p> rope around his neck , do you see him waking up happy , hallooing the sun ? Same thing .

No , Nicaragua . Myself , I like Lorca . Lorca , you know , was assassinated by Franco 's guardia civil . " Why that note ? Because , if it happened to him , Alberto Perera , here and now , his death might possess a similar meaning . An enlightened heart snuffed out . <p> " When he says , like , Spider , greet the sun , where do you figure he was lying ? " Slyly , the fellow waited . <p> " Was he lying ?

" <p> " That 's a thought . " <p> " That 's not a thought . That 's the truth . " <p> " A poem can come to you wherever you are , " Perera explained . " Whatever you 're doing . Sleeping , eating , even looking in the fridge , or when you think you 're dying . I imagine that in his case he wakes up one morning after a bad night , takes a look at the sun , and accepts who he is . He accepts the enigma of himself . " <p> " Are you ? " <p> " Am I what ?

That 's what I 'm saying . What's-his-name wouldn't 've thought up that poem if he woke up where he was lying on the sidewalk . " <p> " Dario , " said Pereda , " could very well have waked up on a sidewalk . " He pursued that sort of life . Opium , absinthe . Quite possibly he was visited by that poem while lying on the sidewalk . " <p> " Then he went back to his own bed and slept it off . " <p> With trembling fingers the fellow gathered up his scraps from the desk . Trembling with what ? With timidity , if this was a confrontation with a guardian of the virtues of every book in the place ? As he bent to the floor to pick up his scraps , the crown of his head was revealed , the hair sprinkled with a scintilla of the stuff of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fellow ? Not more than thirty , maybe younger . Young , with no staying power . <p> By the door a coughing spell took hold of him . With his back to Perera he drew out from yet another pocket in the murky interior of the parka one of those large Palestinian scarves that Arafat wore around his head and were to be seen in the windows of used clothing stores , and brought up into it whatever he had tried to keep down . Voiceless , he left , his bare ankles slapped by the grimy cuffs of his pants . <p> Perera imagined him shuffling down the hall , then down the wide white marble stairs , the grandiose interior stairs , centerpiece of this eternal granite edifice . As for Dario 's admonition to the spider to show no rancor , that fellow 's rancor was showing all over him . Yet his voice was scratchily respectful and his fingers trembled .

A rarity , in this time when librarians ' ranks were shrinking down as his own head had shrunk while bent for so many years over the invaluable minutiae of his responsibilities , including the selection of belles-lettres , of poetry , of literary fiction . The cranium shrinks no matter how much knowledge is crammed inside it . A rarity for another reason  --  a librarian who did not look like one , who wore a Borsalino fedora , his a classic of thirty years , a Bogart raincoat , English boots , a black silk shirt , a vintage tie . <p> Never as dashing as he wished to appear , however . Slight , short , and for several years now the bronze-color curls gone gray and the romantically drooping eyelids of his youth now faded flags at half-mast . Dashing , though , in the literary realm , numbering among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter to Perera , the youth , on the Spanish Civil War ; Samuel Beckett , on critics mired up to their necks in his plays ; Neruda , handwritten lines in green ink of two of his poems  --  what a prize Also a note from the lovely British actress Vanessa Redgrave , with whom he 'd spent an hour in London when he 'd delivered to her an obscure little book of letters by Isadora Duncan , whom she 'd portrayed in a film . And more , so much more . Everything kept in a bank vault and to be carried away in a black leather attache case with double locks when he left this city for warmer climes . It was time to donate it all to an auction of literary memorabilia , on condition that the proceeds established a fund for down-and-out librarians . <p> Further , he was a rarity for choosing to reside in what he called the broken heart of the city , or the spleen of it , the Tenderloin , and choosing not to move when the scene worsened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brooklyn their alien soil , he felt a kinship with the dispossessed everywhere in the world , this kinship deepening with the novels he 'd read in his youth . Dostoyevsky 's insulted and injured , Dickens 's downtrodden . Eighteen years ago he 'd found a fourth-floor apartment , the top , in a tentatively respectable building , a walking distance to the main library in the civic center and to the affordable restaurants on Geary Street . Soon after he moved in , the sidewalks and entrances on every block began to fill up with a surge of outcasts of all kinds . The shaven heads , the never-shaven faces , the battle-maimed , the dope-possessed , the jobless , the homeless , the immigrants , and , not far from his own corner , six-foot-tall transvestite prostitutes , and shorter ones , too , all colors . A wave , gathering momentum , swept around him now as he made his way , mornings and evenings , to and from the library . There was no city in the world that was not inundated in its time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugees from upheavals of all sorts . <p> On gray days , as this day was , he was reminded of the poor lunatics , madmen , nuisances , all who were herded out of the towns and onto the ships that carried them up and down the rivers of the Rhineland . An idea The mayor , having deprived the homeless of their carts and their tents , would welcome an idea to rid the city of the homeless themselves . Herd them aboard one of those World War II battleships , rusting away in dry dock or muck , and send them out to sea . The thousands  --  whole families , loners , runaway kids  --  all to be dropped off in Galveston or New Orleans , under cover of a medieval night . <p> He ate his supper at Lefty O'Doul 's , at a long table in company of other men his age and a woman who looked even older . Retired souls , he called them , come in from their residence hotels , their winter smells of naphthalene and menthol hovering over the aroma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ashamed of eating a substantial meal while the hungry roamed the streets . He told himself this as he 'd told himself so many times before , lifelong . He knew from youthful , saintly experiments of his own that when he fasted in sympathy , punishing himself for what he thought was plenitude , his conscience began to starve , unable to survive for very long without a body . <p> A brandy at the long bar , and the bartender slapping down the napkin , asking the usual . " When you going to sell me that Borsalino ? " Then , " This man 's a librarian , " to the bulky young man in a broadly striped sweater on the stool to the left of Perera . " He 's read every book in the public library . Ever been in there ? " <p> " Never was . " <p> " You can ask him anything , " said the bartender , and the man to Perera 's right did . " Do you know right off the number of dead both sides in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Taken for a tricky intellectual , he was left alone . <p> A theater critic , that 's what he wished to be mistaken for , passing the theaters at the right time as the ticket holders were drifting in and the lines were forming at the box office . Women 's skirts and coats swinging out , swishing against him , and a woman turning to apologize , granting a close glimpse of her face to this man who appeared deserving of it . A critic , that 's who he was , of the musical up there on the stage and of the audience so delightedly acceptive of the banal , lustily sung . <p> Past the lofty Hilton at the Tenderloin 's edge , whose ultra-plush interior he had strolled through a time or two , finding gold beyond an interior decorator 's wildest dreams . Its penthouse window the highest light in the Tenderloin sky , a shining blind eye . Around a corner of the hotel , and , lying up against the cyclone fence , the bundled and the unbundled to whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fear and respect . Over the sidewalks , those slips of refuse paper he 'd always noticed but not so closely as now . Alert to approaching figures , to whatever plans they had in mind for him , and warily friendly with the fraternal dusters , exchanging with them joking curses on the weather , he made his way . Until at last he stood before the mesh gate to his apartment building . A gate from sidewalk to the entrance 's upper reaches , requiring a swift turn of the key before an assault . The gate , the lock , the fear  --  none of which had been there when he moved in . <p> The only man in the western world to wear a nightcap , he drew his on . Cashmere , dove color , knitted twelve years ago by his dear friend and lover Barbara , a librarian herself , a beautiful one . Syracuse , New York . Every year , off they 'd go . Archaeological tours , walking tours . Three winters ago he was at her bedside , close-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponded with writers . Hers were women  --  poets , memoirists  --  and these letters , too , were in his care . Into his plaid flannel robe , also a gift from her , the seat and the elbows worn away . He always read in this robe in his ample chair or at the kitchen table or in bed . Three books lay on the floor by his bed , among the last he 'd ever consider ordering for any library . One had seduced and deceived him , the second was unbearably vain , and he was put to sleep by the third , already asleep itself , face-down on the carpet . <p> When he lay down the inevitable happened . At once he wondered where the poetry stalker might be , the librarian stalker with the excitable cough . Could Dario have imagined that his earnest little attempt to accept God 's ways would wind up in the parka pocket of a sidewalk sleeper , trying to accept the same a hundred years later ? <p> At his desk he was always attuned to the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library where he 'd spent his years , even the vaster ones with more locked doors , tonnages of archives . This morning his mind 's eye was a benign sensor , following the patrons to their chosen areas . He saw them rising in the slow , creaky elevator , he saw the meandering ones and the fast ones climbing the broad marble stairs , those stairs like a solid promise to the climber of an ennobling of the self on the higher levels . The largest concentration of patrons was in the newspaper and periodical section , always and forever a refuge for men from lonely rooms and also now for those without a room , all observing the proper silence , except the man asleep , head down on the table , his glottal breathing quivering the newspaper before his face . In the past , empty chairs were always available , now every chair was occupied . And where was the young man whose pockets were filled with scraps of poetry ? In the poetry section , of course , copying down what the world saw fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents the godlike and anything in myself represents the vile . Who said that ? A writer , born into grim poverty , whose name he 'd recall later . If you felt vile in the midst of all these godlike volumes , what restless rage <p> " Am I butting in here ? " <p> Same parka , grimier perhaps . But look His hair rose higher and had a reddish cast , an almost washed look from the rain . His eyes not clearer , not calmer , and in his arms four books , which he let fall onto the desk . <p> " This is not a checkout desk , " said Perera . <p> " That I know . Never check out anything . No address . If you try to sneak something out , you get the guillotine . You get it in the neck . " <p> To touch or not to touch the books . Since there was no real reason not to touch , Perera set the four books upright , his hands as bookends . <p> " Who have we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . And here we 've got Whitman . You know how to pick them . Bishop , she 's up there . And who 's this ? Pound ? Sublime , all of them . But do n't let yourself be intimidated . Nothing sacred in this place , just a lot of people whose thoughts were driving them crazy , euphoria-crazy or doom-crazy , and they had to get it out , see what you think about what they 're thinking . That 's all there is to it . Librarians in here are just to give it a semblance of order . I 'm not a high priest <p> " Never thought you were . " <p> " Ah , " said Perera , and the books between his hands resumed their frayed existence , their common humanity . One , he saw , had a bit of green mildew at the spine 's bottom edge . It must have been left out in a misty rain or someone had read it while in the tub . <p> " Can I get you some coffee ? " inquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Perera . " Got my thermos here . A thirst for coffee comes over me at this hour . " How closely he 'd been watched And now forced to take the plunge into familiarity , a plunge he would not have taken without further consideration if this man were the sole homeless man around . They were empowered by their numbers . <p> From the bottom drawer , he brought up his thermos and his porcelain cup . The plastic thermos cup held no pleasure , and he never used it . He 'd use it now and not bother to guess why , and bring up also the paper bag of macaroons . <p> " Suppose I sit down ? " <p> Perera nodded , and the guest sat down in the only chair , a hard chair with an unwelcoming look , a chair used until now only by Alexa Okula , head librarian , and Amy Peck , chief guard , who often described for him the assaults she had suffered that day and where in the library they had occurred . <p> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble holding it . " This is like dessert , " he said . " This is great . Got sugar and cream in it . " He was shy around the macaroons . Crumbs were tripping down the parka , and when they reached the floor he covered them with his beat-up jogging shoes . <p> At that moment Pereda recalled the Sacramento library tragedy . When did the shooting occur ? Right after a little party celebrating the library 's expanded hours . And what did the assassin do then ? Fled to the rooftop , where he was gunned down by the police . It was simple enough to imagine himself dead on the floor , but not so easy to imagine this fellow fleeing anywhere , hampered by the bone-cold ankles , the flappy shoes , the body 's tremble at the core . <p> " You remember that poem ? " his guest asked . <p> " Not verbatim , " said Perera . " I did not memorize it . " <p> " You can remember the bear , ca n't you , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to greet the sun because they are what they are ? " <p> " That I remember , " said Perera . <p> " What I 'd like to know is , what am I ? " <p> " You can figure you 're a human being , " said Perera . <p> " That 's what I thought you 'd say . What else you were going to say is , you 're a human being by the sweat of your brow . Beavers , that do n't take into account beavers . Beavers are dam builders . Then you take those birds who get stuff together to make a nest for the female of their choice . Other birds , too , I 've seen them . Ca n't stop pulling up weeds or whatever stuff is around for a hundred miles , pull this out , pull that out , and off they go and back in a second . Then there 's animals who dig a burrow , one hell of a long tunnel in the ground . They ca n't sweat , but they work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them human . " <p> " Work does not get to the essence . I see your point said Perera . At a moment 's notice he could not get to the essence himself , and he wished he had not used that word . It could only mean further trouble . <p> " Okay , take you , " said the visitor . " Would you say you were human ? " <p> " I 've been led to believe that I am , " said Perera . <p> " What you base that on , " said his guest , " is you get to keep guard over this library and you got every book where it 's supposed to be and in addition you got it up on a computer , what is its title , what is its number , who wrote it , and maybe you got in your head the reason why the guy wrote it . So in that way you can say you 're human and maybe you 're glad about it even if you do n't look it . Okay , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you walk home . Or you go on and have yourself a turkey or whatever they got there , roast beef , chicken and dumplings . Then you go along by that theater , maybe even drop in yourself at fifty bucks a seat in the balcony . After that you go on to your apartment , which is in a bad , I mean baaad neighborhood , and you unlock that gate . And then what ? " <p> " I ca n't imagine . " <p> " You do n't have to imagine . You 're in your own bed . Got a mattress that 's just right for the shape you 're in . Maybe you even got an electric blanket . Got pillows with real feathers inside , maybe even that down stuff from the hind end of a couple hundred ducks . Nighty night . " <p> " So now I 'm sure I 'm human ? " <p> " So then the sun comes up and what do you say ? You say what that spider says . Halloo , old sun up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now I get to eat some more fat flies . Halloo , says the toad , now I get to spend the day in this hot mud some more . Halloo , says the bear , now I get to dance some more with this rope around my neck . Halloo , says this guy , Alberto Perera , now <p> get to go to the library again and talk to this guy who ca n't figure out why he ca n't halloo the sun with the rest of them . " <p> A flush had spread over the fellow 's face , over the pallor and over the pits , over all that was more appallingly obvious today . From his parka he brought out the Arafat headpiece and hid his face in it , coughing up in there something tormentingly intimate . <p> Alexa Okula , head librarian , passing by and hearing the commotion , paused a moment to look in , and Perera held up his hand to calm her fears for his safety . Nothing escaped her , only all the years of her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of granite . Soon to be released , just as he was to be , all she 'd have was her stringy emeritus professor of a husband and her poodles . Unlike himself , who 'd have the world . <p> The fellow sat staring at the floor , striving to recover from the losing battle with his cough . <p> " You suppose I could spend the night in here ? " <p> With unthinkable on the tip of his tongue , Perera said nothing . Accommodations ought to be available for queries of every sort at any time in your life . <p> " Looks like it ought to be safer in here . " <p> " Unsafe in here , too , " said Perera . " This fortress is in a state of abject deterioration . The last earthquake did some damage , along with the damage done by the budget cuts , along with the damage by vandals . Time 's been creeping around in here , too . The whole damned thing could collapse on you while you slept <p> " I can handle it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw lighter fuel on me and set me on fire in here . Nobody 's going to knife me in here , at night , anyway . Lost my bedroll . I left my stuff with this woman who 's my friend , she got room in her cart . I had a change of shirt in there , I had important papers , had a letter from a guy I worked for up the coast . I was good at hauling in those sea urchins they ship over to Japan , tons of them . They love those things over there , then there was n't any more . Where the sea urchins were , something else is taking over , messing up the water . I 'm telling you this because I do n't drink , do n't do dope , do n't smoke , so I sure would not set this place on fire if I was allowed to sleep in here . " He was talking fast , outrunning his cough . " The cops took her stuff , took my stuff , dumped it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost family pictures , lost the cat she had tied to the cart that sat on top . She was crying . I was in here talking to you . " <p> " It must be damn cold in here at night , " Perera said . <p> " Maybe , maybe not , and if it 's raining , maybe the roof do n't leak . " <p> " Dark , I imagine , " said Perera . " I 've never thought about it . <p> suspect they used to leave a few lights on , but now it 's dark . Saves money . Let 's say that once the lights go out you ca n't see a thing . Your sense of direction is totally lost , you 're blind as a bat , and I 'm nowhere around to guide you to the lavatory , and I would n't know where it was myself .

But how to get there ? " <p> " I know my way around . " <p> " You do seem to , " said Perera . <p> " What you could do when you take off , like your day is done , see ? You could just leave me in here and close the door . I would n't care if you locked it . " <p> " I can lock it , " said Perera , " but not with you inside . " <p> " Is there some of that coffee left ? " <p> Perera , pouring , was planning to wash that porcelain cup thoroughly . If it was pneumonia gripping this young man , it would get a more merciless grip on him , twice as old . Or if it was tuberculosis , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was about to embark on his most rewarding years . <p> This time the guest took longer to drink it down , the hot coffee feeling its way cautiously past the throat 's lacerations . <p> " Let 's say it 's like that darkness upon the face of the deep , " Perera said . " That same darkness the Creationists are wanting to take us back to . Dark , dark , and you need to find yourself a comfortable place . Now let 's say you 're at the top of our marble stairs and you do n't know it . You take a step , and down you go . Come morning , they open up and find you there <p> " You think so ? " <p> " You 'll be on the front pages in New York , Paris , Tokyo . A homeless man , seeking shelter in San Francisco 's main library , fell down in there and died .

Same thing you 're saying . If you ca n't halloo the sun , if you ca n't go chirpity chirp to the moon , what 're you doing around here anyway ? " <p> " That is not what it is saying , " said Perera . <p> " To hell with you is what I 'm saying . " <p> Gone , leaving his curse behind . A curse so popular , so spread around , it carried little weight . <p> Closing time , the staff and lingering patrons all forced out through one side entrance and into the early dark , into the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary , bought in London the day he met the actress , years ago . It will never turn inside out , the clerk promised , not even in Conrad 's typhoon . And it had n't yet . Lives were being turned inside out , but this snob of an umbrella stayed up there . A stance of superiority , that was his problem . A problem he always knew he had and yet that always took him by surprise . And how did he figure he was so smart , this Alberto Perera ? Well , he could engage in the jesting the smart ones enjoy when they 're in the presence of those they figure are not so smart . He could engage in that jovial thievery , that light-fingered , lightheaded trivializing of another person 's tragic truth , a practice he abhorred wherever he came upon it . <p> Onward through this neon-colored rain , this headlight-glittering rain , every light no match for the dark , only a constant contesting .

After work he climbed the stairs to Hospitality House and looked around at the men in the collection of discarded chairs , each day different men , and each man confounded by being among the unwanted many .

He bought a green nylon parka in a discount place on Market Street , slid the books into the deep pockets , and folded the parka on top the pile . <p> On the morning of the twelfth day , before the hour when the public was admitted , Perera entered by the side door , bringing <p> pair of black plastic shoes , oxford style , made in China , recommended for their comfort by a street friend wearing a pair . The door guard silently led him to the foot of the marble stairs , where Okula , cops and paramedics and librarians were gathered around a man lying on the lowest step . <p> Perera had never fainted and was not going to faint now , even though all the strength of his intelligence was leaving the abode of his head to darkness . <p> " Mr. Perera , " Okula was saying but not to him , " was an acquaintance of this man . Was n't he ? " <p> Nobody was answering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " he stepped into my office . My door is usually open . " Sweat was rising from his scalp . " Did he fall ? " <p> " More like he lay down and died . " The paramedic 's voice was inappropriately young . " TB . Take a look at that rag . " <p> " You say you knew him ? " A cop 's voice . " Do you know his name ? He 's got nothing in his pockets . " <p> " No , " said Perera . <p> " Any idea where he concealed himself in here ? " <p> " Hundreds of places Okula , responding . " We check carefully . However , anyone wishing to stay in can also check carefully <p> " What you might be needing is a couple of dogs . German shepherds are good at it . Dobermans , too . A couple of good dogs could cover this whole place in half an hour Kneeling by the body , Perera took a closer look at the face , closer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal kingdom . The young man was now no one , as he 'd feared he already was when alive . The absolute unwanted , that 's who the dead become . <p> " Did this man bother you ? " <p> It would take many months , he knew , before he 'd be able to speak without holding back . Humans speaking were unbearable to hear and abominable to see , himself among the rest . Worse was all that was written down instead , the never-ending outpouring , given print and given covers , given shelves up and down and everywhere in this warehouse of fathomless darkness . <p> " He did not bother me , " he said . <p> The door to his office was closed but unlocked , just as he 'd left it . Scattered over his desk were what appeared to be the contents of his wastebasket . But unfamiliar , not his . So many kinds of paper scraps , they were the bits and pieces his visitor had brought forth from that green parka . Throwaway ads , envelopes , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On each , the cramped handwriting . By copying down all these stirringly strange ideas , had the fellow hoped to impress upon himself his likeness to these other humans ? A break-in of a different sort . <p> young man breaking into a home of his own . <p> Perera sat down at his desk , slipped his glasses on , and spread the scraps out before him as heedfully as his shaking hands allowed . <p>
