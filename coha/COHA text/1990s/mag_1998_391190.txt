When the World Wide Web finally yields profits , the gains wo n't go to those who attract the most eyeballs , but to those who tempt the most fingertips <p> LIKE A SIREN SONG of the Digital Age , the World Wide Web has lured thousands of companies into spending billions to get a foothold in cyberspace . They have picked the wrong model : advertising . <p> Their vision : tough luck for TV , newspapers and magazines . Major portions of corporate ad budgets would migrate to the Web . But the Web is n't media  --  it 's a store , a Mall of America writ large . It is n't about capturing eyeballs , it 's about fingertips clicking on the buy button . <p> " Most people took their sensibilities from other media and tried to impose them on the Web . That was a mistake , " says George Bell , chief executive of Excite , Inc. , a portal that relies on ad sales for 75% of revenue . <p> That poses unpleasant challenges for many on the Web . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to find new sales streams . Media companies may have to raze the once-sacred barrier between content and commerce and start selling things on-line . Big brands will have to get the nerve to compete against their retail partners . Levi Strauss &Co.; just took the plunge ( see p. 102 ) . <p> But can today 's Web outposts reinvent themselves as shopping malls ? The chiefs of Yahoo ! , Lycos , Excite and Infoseek all say skimming a fee from on-line sales will provide the bulk of their business in a few years . <p> " We are n't losing faith in advertising , but it is n't growing as quickly as we thought , " concedes Robert Davis , chief executive of Lycos , Inc. , who hastens to emphasize : " The selling opportunity ahead of us is overwhelming . " At Infoseek Corp. , though ad fees provide 75% of sales , on-line retailing " is our fastest-growing segment , and it will be the biggest part of our revenue " in two to five years , says Chief Executive Harry Motro . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> America Online , Inc. , in agreeing last month to acquire Netscape Communications Corp . for $4.2 billion , is moving past advertising to embracee-commerce . AOL will even build a new business selling software tools to businesses that , like itself , want to rack up sales on-line . <p> " The mission here is the consumer , " says America Online 's president , Robert Pittman . " The on-line shopping world is just like the physical world of shopping . What matters is location , location , location  --  and that 's what we can give people . " <p> In the old commerce , location meant places that attracted crowds . So too in e-commerce : AOL knows how to attract crowds . Chairman and Chief Executive Stephen Case sees a threefer : " We have this unique ability to create a paying audience , deliver a ( paid-for ) message , and then conduct the transaction , all in one place . " <p> What happened to the advertising dream ? From a distance the numbers look good : Ad spending on-line has swelled almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Forrester Research says . <p> But that is less than 1% of what U.S. businesses will spend on all advertising this year . Up close , the details get pretty ugly . A massive 80% of all Web ad space goes unsold , even at hot sites like Yahoo ! . The leftover time gets dumped at fire-sale prices . Only 25 top Web firms got over 80% of all ad spending in the second quarter of 1998 . Many sites fork over commissions of 30% to 70% of an ad 's price to the agencies that place the spots . In other media the fee is 15% at best . <p> Popular Web services brag about " CPM " rates ( cost per thousand viewers ) that rival the $25 to $35 prices of a prime-time commercial on an NBC hit like ER . But those lofty levels seem ready to crash . They could hit the $8-to-$10 range in the not-too-distant future , says Beth Haggerty , senior vice president at Infoseek . <p> That is n't a business model  --  it 's an equation for failure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ago shares of Theglobe.com , an on-line " community " where ads pose 90% of puny revenue , went public and shot up nearly elevenfold . Even after retreating to $39 , the shares were up 300% from their offering price . Investors have yet to grasp that while the Web may be the future , the future does not lie in ad revenues . <p> The Web stormed onto the media scene five years ago as a pictures-and-text overlay to the gorpy , words-only Internet , born three decades earlier . The first ad popped up in September 1994 , and media companies raced to shovel their print and broadcast properties into new on-line venues . <p> Now several billion ads run every month , and Web surfers have , with disturbing rapidity , grown inured to the overkill . Fewer than 1% of all ads get a follow-up " click " for more information , and this " click-through " rate has fallen sharply this year . <p> Fewer than half of all Web ads let you zoom in and make a purchase ; most are static billboards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They thus lose the Web 's great advantage over other media : its ability to deliver instant consumer gratification . <p> " In the beginning we felt we had to prove the ad model worked . We would accept anything , " says James Barksdale , chief executive of Netscape . But it 's now clear on the Web , he says , " You should get something when you click . " <p> Some people liken the Web 's torrid growth to television  --  but TV ads grew far faster . In television 's first year ( 1949 ) the new medium grabbed 1.1% of all ad spending ; by the fourth year its share had risen to 6.4% ( it 's at about 24% nowadays ) . The World Wide Web , too , is in its fourth year as an ad vehicle  --  and its share of all ad money is still at only 0.7% . Combined ad spending in cyberspace this year will be less than the 1998 TV budget of General Motors Corp . alone . <p> With the ad model fading , e-commerce looms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Web site , visitors can read a book review and click to get prices and log an order . The Post pockets a cut , usually 5% to 15%  --  less than the book 's publisher would have to pay to a conventional bookseller . And it 's a good deal for the Post : If its writeup sells books , it gets a cut . <p> That seeming conflict of interest might have riled journalists in the past , but the hard reality of Web losses makes some realize you ca n't stop the future . " We 're investing millions in the Web and we 're not in sight of a profit yet . And certainly that has colored my attitude , " says Robert Kaiser , the Post 's managing editor when the site opened and now an associate editor . <p> " Business-to-business " has already shown the way . Intel Corp . takes in a billion dollars a month selling chips on the Web . E-commerce for consumers will move much more slowly . Mail-order catalogs can go anywhere , but the Web reaches only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever made an on-line purchase , Forrester says . <p> Amazon.com Inc. racked up more than $430 million in on-line book sales in the past 12 months , but it ran losses of $85 million . Intuit Corp . pays AOL $10 million a year for a three-year marketing deal but landed less than $5 million in sales in six months . <p> Some hot brands , such as Liz Claiborne , are bent on avoiding selling on the Web altogether . Others impose restraints . IBM runs snazzy TV ads on its " e-business " expertise but buys more on-line each month  --  $600 million in gear  --  than it sells ( $460 million ) . The IBM site limits which PC models are available and refers visitors to their nearest dealer for the rest . <p> And so it goes : Businesses worry about miffing their dealers , consumers worry about the security of their credit cards , media companies worry that selling goods will compromise their credibility . But these barriers may fall to the all-powerful convenience and efficiency of the Web . <p> Says Chunka Mui , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Web is a store  --  and the service center and the 800 number and the customer relations office , all rolled into one and more tied together than ever before . " Conventional businesses may dislike it , but that 's the way it is . Web advertising continues to grow ... but more Web sites are seeking advertising ... and ads are becoming less effective TABLE <p> Source Forester Research , Inc .
