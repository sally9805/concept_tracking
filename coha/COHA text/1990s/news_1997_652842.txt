<p> On Aug. 14 , 1945 , 300 Jewish orphans recently liberated from Nazi concentration camps sat huddled on the floor of 12 Lancaster bombers on their way to the British Isles . " The precious cargo , " their social workers called them . <p> The children were cold and airsick but excited . The philanthropist Leonard Montefiore had persuaded the reluctant British Government to take them in , and the Home Office had given permission for 1,000 to land . But such was the toll in the camps that only 732 children could be found , mostly boys age 12 to 16 . There were only 80 girls . <p> Over the next few months , the children were flown to England , Ireland and Scotland and nursed back to health . Eventually , as young adults , they scattered . But they kept in touch . They formed the ' 45 Aid Society to help one another in time of need . And as the years passed " the boys , " as they continue to call themselves well into their 60 's , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " The Boys , " a book by Sir Martin Gilbert , a British historian of the Holocaust and the official biographer of Winston Churchill . It compiles their reminiscences from Poland , Hungary and Czechoslovakia before and during the war . There are accounts of the death camps , of parents killed in front of their children 's eyes , of hunger , of bodies ridden with lice . There are the memories of the long road back to health . <p> About 650 boys are alive , including 250 in Britain and 120 in the United States . Their unofficial leader for nearly 50 years has been Ben Helfgott , 67 , originally from the Polish town of Piotrkow , south of Lodz , now a retired clothing manufacturer in Harrow , England . His mother and younger sister were shot in a roundup of Jews . His father was killed trying to escape a death march . On May 9 , 1945 , at 15 , he was liberated from Theresienstadt in Czechoslovakia . He was on the first transport of Jewish children from Prague to Windermere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' 45 Aid Society . <p> " For our 1995 anniversary , I thought it was time a book was written about us , " Mr. Helfgott said recently in a phone interview from London . " I approached Sir Martin , " the honorary president of the ' 45 Aid Society . <p> " He agreed , " Mr. Helfgott continued , " so we wrote to all our members to ask them to send in their stories . " " The Boys " ( Henry Holt &; Company ) was published in England last year and will be issued in the United States tomorrow . The story is little known except for journalists ' accounts from the time . There is little if anything about the boys ' journey in the Holocaust archives , Sir Martin discovered . <p> Sir Martin found that in many ways the lives of the younger survivors had taken a different trajectory from those of older people who emerged from the camps . There is a sense among them of buoyancy and hope , a zest for life . " There is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The older survivors came out of the camps as individuals . This group stayed together for three , four , five years . It seemed to have given them a sort of collective strength . They were never without someone who understood . <p> " Very few of the older survivors had that opportunity to be in a group for which there is no shame , no inhibitions . " <p> One Typical Story Of Losing a Family <p> For some of the boys , it took nearly 50 years and Sir Martin 's prodding to be able to express their memories . Some still can not ; they have not fully shared their stories even with wives and children . <p> In many ways , Maurice Vegh 's story is typical . Mr. Vegh , a 66-year-old hairdresser in Long Beach , N.Y. , recalled an idyllic childhood in Rakhov , then in Czechoslovakia , now in Ukraine . " It was peaceful , very pretty , " he said in an interview at his home . " My mother prepared lovely Sabbath meals . The smells on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 when he was taken to Auschwitz with his parents and 11-year-old sister . There , Josef Mengele , the camp 's SS doctor , selected his mother and sister to die . He was sent to work as a slave laborer in a coal mine and never saw his father again . <p> In January 1945 , Mr. Vegh was sent on a forced march to Buchenwald . " It was windy and cold , " he said . " All we had were our striped clothing and wooden shoes . They told us to rest in the snow . Half of us never got up . " <p> Mr. Vegh was 15 and weighed 68 pounds . On April 11 , the Americans arrived . " It was deadly silent , " he remembered in the interview . " All of a sudden , roaring tanks broke through the barbed wire . We saw American uniforms . I have never seen soldiers cry before . " <p> As soon as he was well enough , Mr. Vegh made his way to Prague , where he was reunited with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Czechoslovakia , he got on the second transport of children , from Prague to Scotland , where he was taken to Polton House , a manor in Midlothian . <p> Some Had to Fib To Get on the Planes <p> Mr. Vegh contributed to " The Boys . " Victor Breitburg , the retired owner of a woodworking plant in nearby Levittown , N.Y. , may have found the effort too painful . He appears in the book in a group photograph of the first contingent of children on their way from Prague to Windermere when he was 18 . <p> Mr. Breitburg did agree to talk about his experiences in an interview . He was one of the children who lied about their age , shaving a year or two , to get on the transports . " You had to be 16 , " he said . " I was 18 . I was tall , but skinny . " <p> Mr. Breitburg 's father died of malnutrition in the Lodz ghetto in 1943 . His mother , brother and sister were separated from him at Auschwitz . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My mother said , ' You go . ' I never saw them again . " <p> Social workers who met the planes in England , Ireland and Scotland were surprised that the children , several months out of the camps by then , seemed relatively healthy and had already gained some weight . But that appearance was only superficial , said a report on the Windermere children by the Westmorland County Council that Sir Martin cites in " The Boys . " Some had running sores , tuberculosis , teeth knocked out by guards , toes missing from frostbite . " On exertion , it was found they easily became breathless , " the report said . <p> Social workers noticed that many wore " an anxious expression . " <p> Having known only hunger for years , the children grabbed food at meals , fought over it and hoarded it . " They just kept giving us food , " Mr. Breitburg said . " They gave us clothes , whatever we wanted . And it worked . We learned for the first time that you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In many ways , though , they were typical teen-agers . Sir Martin quotes the Westmorland report : " They seemed to attach more importance to being clothed decently than to anything else , feeling that this was a certain proof that they were to be cared for and looked after . " <p> The strength that helped the children survive also made them demanding . They insisted on pocket money , bicycles and movies . But they did not cry , social workers noted . <p> By July 1947 , the boys had begun to feel safe . A magazine article noted , " Boys who on their arrival would have flown out in a passion at any rebuke , now accept a telling off with an engaging grin . " <p> When they were well enough , the children were sent to hostels . Their lives revolved around the London hostel at 27 Belsize Park , which they named the Primrose Club . There they played football and had dances where some , like Mr. Vegh , met future wives . <p> " One Saturday night I walked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tie , " Mr. Vegh remembered . " I saw this pretty little blonde girl . I thought , I would like to dance with that girl . She did n't say no . It was love at first sight . We have been dancing ever since . " <p> Achieving Success And Staying Hopeful <p> As the boys became young men , some returned to Europe to look for lost relatives . Almost all were disappointed . Some never gave up hope . " Help me to find my brother , " Sam Weizenbluth of Toronto wrote in the memoir he sent to Sir Martin . <p> Most remained in England . Some went to Israel and fought in the Israeli war of independence . In 1963 , the Primrose Club was replaced by the ' 45 Aid Society . <p> " By and large , the men were successful , " Sir Martin said on the phone from London . A few earned Ph.D 's . Some were tailors or jewelers . Mr. Helfgott represented Britain twice on its Olympic weight lifting team . Hugo Gryn , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We came here naked , " Mr. Helfgott said from London . " We 've tried to build a family and inject into it a zest for life . You would think we could not have had a family . There were very , very few divorces . " <p> Mr. Helfgott agreed that the children who survived the camps seemed to fare better than the adults who did . " Most older survivors lost wives and children , " he said . " Then in their 20 's and 30 's , they remarried . The husband and wife led a double life : in their minds they always thought of the past . <p> " But the children , beyond our original loss , we did n't have a family . We married local girls . They had a family . Then our lives were bringing up our children . " <p> A Sense of Closure And a 50th Reunion <p> In 1995 the boys had their 50th reunion in London . There was a reception and a dinner dance . Some boys found long lost friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " At the reunions , the affection , intimacy and hugging each other is quite extraordinary , " Sir Martin said . <p> " It is no accident , " he said , that the boys want their story told now . " They are all into their late 60 's , " Sir Martin explained . " Their life struggle has ended . Their children have grown up , gone to universities . They have seen their grandchildren , seen a continuity . They now have more leisure , to look back and to be caught in their dreams and nightmares . " <p> With the book and with the coming of old age , a sense of closure has affected the boys . Last year Mr. Breitburg returned to Poland . " I went to Auschwitz , went to the apartment where I lived , " he said . " I showed my wife the ghetto . I was saying goodbye . " <p> At the end of the book , Moniek Goldberg , who lives in Florida , observes : " Fifty years on I reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten what I learned as a boy . I helped my fellow man when I could . We were among the beasts , and I am proud to declare that we upheld the dignity of man . " <p> Chart : " Birth of a Book " " It all began with my wededing , " Sir Martin Gilbert , the historian , said by telephone from London . " We needed a rabbi . And my wife-to-be knew Hugo Gryn , who was one of ' the boys . ' He became my best friend . " Through Rabbi Gryn , Sir Martin met the others . Over dinner in 1977 , Rabbi Gryn suggested that the historian take on the Holocaust as his subject . " Like many survivors , Hugo got what he wanted , " Sir Martin said : in 1986 , the historian published " The Holocaust , " his monumental work . " Then , Ben Helfgott began to say I should write a book about the boys . " Sir Martin initally resisted , then started soliciting memories .
