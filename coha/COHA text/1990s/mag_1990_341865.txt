" Takes you by surprise ! " reads the cheery slogan for Cisco , a fruit-flavored - beverage produced by New York 's Canandaigua winery . The claim rings true , for Cisco 's alcohol content is 20% , almost twice that of most wines and four times that of wine coolers . A growing number of health and consumer groups are asking Canandaigua to recall all bottles until the packaging and marketing are revamped . Critics contend that Cisco 's screw-top bottles , fruit flavors and availability in many convenience stores create the impression that the product is akin to wine coolers . Canandaigua insists that customers know Cisco is different from a wine cooler because it is more expensive and is sold in individual bottles rather than four-packs . Says a spokesman : " We are producing a legal product , legally packaged . "
