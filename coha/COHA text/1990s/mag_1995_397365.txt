Who 's the 800-pound gorilla in Washington nowadays ? It was Bill Clinton for a day or two , but lately he 's been looking like a 90-pound chimp . Then for a week after the election it was Newt ( Newtron Bomb ) Gingrich , the Georgia Republican who is set to become the next Speaker of the House . But since Nov. 15 , there 's been no doubt who 's the real power on the Potomac , at least as far as the economy is concerned . It 's Alan Greenspan , the Federal Reserve chairman who jacked up short-term interest rates three-quarters of a percentage point to 5.5% in one bold move  --  the Fed 's sixth hike since February and the biggest rate increase since 981 . Why is Greenspan so anxious to fire howitzers at inflation that totaled a popgun 0.1% in October  --  the equivalent of 1.2% at an annual rate ? Because he 's convinced that an inflation surge is lurking just over the horizon . The warning signs he 's looking at : rising prices for raw materials ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 83% of capacity . Some economists do n't share Greenspan 's inflation outlook and think he 's going overboard with the price-buster stuff . A few even see a disaster scenario unfolding over the next couple of years  --  with an overzealous Fed raising rates another full point or more , pushing the country into recession . In a recession , interest rates would fall and long-term-bond prices would soar 10% or more . But stocks could lose as much as 20% of their market value . We do n't think that scenario will unfold  --  and therefore we 're a lot more optimistic about the prospects for the stock market . In our view , the Republican landslide on Nov. 8 gave Greenspan the leeway to raise rates all at once as much as he thought necessary ; for one thing , the Republican victory removed the Fed-bashing Henry Gonzales from the chairmanship of the House Banking Committee . As a result , we think that Greenspan has completed most of his monetary tightening , with only another half point at most to come in early 1995 . And once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy returns for investors : * Stocks , bonds and short-term cash investments will all provide higher returns next year than they did in ' 94. * Selected growth stocks and the mutual funds that specialize in them will return as much as 12% on average . * And safe choices for your cash could earn up to 8% , marking a dramatic turnaround from the low yields that have kept income seekers in a funk for much of the past three years . At a time when Wall Street is decidedly gloomy , our outlook for ' 95 may sound surprisingly upbeat . And in the main , it is . It rests on our expectation that Greenspan will succeed in slowing the economy slightly without tipping the country into recession . The new Republican Congress is likely to help with some small tax cuts that will juice up the economy a bit . " The one goal Clinton and the Republicans agree on is a strong economy , " says Prudential Securities chief investment strategist Greg Smith . In addition , the Republicans ' more relaxed approach to regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cable television . Successful fine-tuning by Greenspan would reduce inflation pressures while allowing corporate profit growth to keep rolling along at a double-digit annual rate . " We 're not going to see the kind of interest rates that would bring Western civilization to its knees , " says Edward Yardeni , chief economist at C.J. Lawrence/Deutsche Bank Securities and one of our three cover subjects . He adds : " Corporate profits are going to increase by 10% to 15 in ' 95-that 's clearly very bullish for the stock market . " Add to that the better-than-even prospect of a capital-gains tax cut next year and growth stocks , especially , may take off . Here 's a fuller rundown of our ' 95 forecast : * The economy 's growth rate  --  measured in terms of real ( that is , inflation-adjusted ) gross domestic product  --  will slow to 2.8% for 1995 , down from 3.8% this year . A bellwether : Housing starts fell 5.2'b in October . * The inflation rate for consumer prices will rise moderately to 3.5% next year , up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misplaced , " says Bill Newman , Kidder Peabody 's chief investment strategist . " Inflation is a phantom . " * The Federal Reserve will push up short-term interest rates to 6% by midyear  --  but then we expect rates to level off . * Long-term interest rates , lately 8.1% , could rise another four-tenths of a point by summer . After that , we expect long-term rates to drift down a tad in the second half of the year . * Including their 3% dividends , US. blue chip , such as the stocks in Standard &; Poor 's 500-stock index , figure to return at least 10% in ' 95. * Small stocks , especially shares of fast-growing companies in technology , health care and retailing , will probably outpace blue chips and move up 12. * Growth-oriented mutual funds could gain 12% or more . * Foreign stocks and the funds that invest in them could appreciate 14%. * Since rising interest rates would depress bond prices , top-quality issues are likely to return 5% at most . This financial outlook is reflected throughout this special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen top mutual funds ( page 34 ) , this issue includes an exclusive rating of the entire S &P; 500 ( page 44 ) . We also offer advice on the savvy strategies for buyers and sellers in today 's housing market ( page 100 ) , the smartest moves for borrowers ( page 96 ) and the best deals now for shoppers ( page 110 ) . THE ECONOMY Underpinning all our projections is our view of Federal Reserve policy . The Fed 's pre-emptive strike against reviving inflation has worked so far . True , widely watched indexes of raw materials prices have surged in the past year , signaling pressures that could lead to inflation within three or four years . But consumer price inflation is still exceptionally low . Over the past 12 months , prices have risen only 3% , and many analysts agree with us that there is little cause for alarm . " Inflation is locked up  --  maybe it 's in that brown envelope at the O.J. trial in L.A. , " says William Dodge , Dean Witter Reynold 's chief investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues , the higher the inflation rate is likely to creep . But Greenspan 's recent sledgehammer rate increase will probably be enough to slow the economy from today 's 3.8% growth rate to the 2.5% to 3% range and thereby diminish inflation pressures . At worst , we see another half-point increase in rates . Once it 's clear that the economy is slowing and inflation is under control , long-term rates are likely to level off . Today 's yields on long-term bonds already presuppose a core inflation rate of 4% or so . And as it becomes clear that inflation is going to peak below that level , yields on long-term Treasury bonds will probably start edging down from 8.5% . THE STOCK MARKET At the most basic level , share prices reflect two factors , the profits corporations stand to earn over the coming year and the value investors set on each dollar of projected profits . This valuation is measured by a stock 's price/earnings ratio . ( Today 's investors are willing to pay almost $15 for each $1 of projected profits-for a 14.9 P/E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebounded strongly ; this year , for example , profits for the stocks in the S &P; 500 are likely to jump more than 30% . That growth rate is certain to slow in ' 95 as the economy throttles back . But by most economists ' estimates , corporate profits will still manage to increase in 1995 at a double-digit rate . " The S &P; 500 could see 14% earnings growth next year , and smaller stocks could have increases of 17% , " says Ben Zacks , executive vice president of Zacks Investment Research in Chicago . Ed Yardeni agrees ; he predicts an 11.5% profit gain for the S &P; 500 . By contrast , stock price/earnings ratios have been dropping since the start of 1992 , when the average P/E for the S &P; 500 peaked at 18.7 . Reason : Once the bull market was two years old , investors began wondering how much longer the good times could last . We think the P/E decline will stop next year once long-term interest rates level off . With the P/E of the S &P; 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that measure  --  stock prices will likely advance in line with companies ' double-digit earnings growth . " I 'm upbeat about ' 95 because the valuation level of the market is much more reasonable than it was two years ago , " says Bradlee Perry , senior partner at Babson Research in Boston . WHAT TO DO Last year , we forecast that 1994 would be a poor year for stocks , with average gains of only about 4% . That call was right on target . If you followed our advice by trimming your holdings of blue chips to 30% or less , you probably do n't have as much in stocks as you normally would . Further , we suggested that you cut back your holdings of long-term bonds to a minimum . ( For an overall assessment of our advice last year , see the box on page 31 . ) Over the coming year , you should raise your investment in equities to 50% or more and shift at least half of your income investments into long-term choices ( such as bonds with 20- to 30-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustments . " As long as interest rates are rising and earnings are growing , there will be a frustrating period where stock prices move up and down , just as they have in ' 94 , " says Jim Solloway , director of research at Argus Research in New York City . As for bonds , figure on tough travels for them at least until spring , when we expect the last of the rate hikes . So add to your stockholdings only gradually during 1995 's first half , and start buying long-term bonds only after rates appear to have peaked , probably after Memorial Day . Meanwhile , keep your income investments in CDs , money funds and bonds with maturities of five years or less ( for more smart income choices , see the story on page 80 ) . In selecting mutual funds , favor those that buy stocks with above-average earnings growth . In the article on page 34 , we profile nine dynamic domestic stock funds , many of which have large holdings of technology issues such as Microsoft and Motorola . Similarly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to churn out profit gains of 15% or more in 1995 . You 'll find many such  --  like software maker Oracle Systems , HMO operator United Healthcare and home improvement supplies retailer Lowe 's  --  in our story rating the entire S &P; 500 on page 44 . Besides big U.S. stocks , we think individual investors should add some small-company shares and foreign stocks to their mix of equity holdings . Small stocks are still a bit cheap by historical standards . They can trade at P/Es ( based on projected earnings ) as much as 19% above that of the S &P; 500 ; but currently they are at only a 7% premium . So small stocks have plenty of room to grow . We profile some great-looking choices  --  such as retailer Bed Bath &; Beyond and sportswear maker Nautica  --  in the story on page 110 . The outlook for foreign stocks looks even better than that for U.S. shares . " Foreign markets could have earnings gains of 20% or more , " says Henry de Vismes , head of international investments for Citibank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseas funds featured in the story on page 34 . ) Finally , we 'd note that although we expect 1995 to be a first-rate year for investors , we do n't think it will be a no-brainer . Stocks and bonds could suffer some temporary reversals in the first six months . But by the second half of ' 95 , we think you 'll be enjoying the kind of double-digit returns that can bring out the 800-pound gorilla in any portfolio . <p>
