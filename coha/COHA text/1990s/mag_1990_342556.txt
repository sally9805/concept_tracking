When is gift wrapping a gift in its own right ? When it 's made of dollar bills . In keeping with that notion , tony Florida clothier Maus &; Hoffman is offering as gift wrap uncut sheets of 32 $1 bills for $55 . ( The Bureau of Engraving and Printing mails such sheets for $47 . ) Sales people at the company 's five stores in Palm Beach , Bal Harbour and other playgrounds of the rich attach a sticker warning that the wrapping is real money . They also provide instructions to iron the sheets and frame them or roll them up for storage in the family safe . Of course , says owner Bill Maus , " some customers simply cut them up and spend them . " His stores use about 400 sheets a year .
