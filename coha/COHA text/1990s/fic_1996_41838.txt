The Buffalo Vision <p> Late on the third night of the Sun Dance , most of the hundred Crow people within the Big Lodge had fallen asleep . The fire was low , the singers ' voices hoarse over the drumbeat . <p> Only John Sees the Hill still danced in place , his back to the circular wall of upright aspen boughs . Shrilling his eagle-bone whistle , John weaved toward the.Center Pole , a white cottonwood limb . From beneath its forked crest a mounted buffalo head stared at him blindly , firelight seething across its brown wool and steely horns . John 's legs wobbled , though an eagle plume stood stiff upright in each of his fists ; like the other dancers , he had neither eaten nor drunk in over two days . John ran at the animal , daring it to turn its anger on him and release its power . But when the buffalo 's lifeless eyes ignored him , John retreated to the shadows . Mouth parched , drained of sweat , he felt like a column of dust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break . <p> Twice more John shuffled , stumbling , to the white tree , only to fall back . Panting , he saw the night as a tilted , spinning wash of light and dark . <p> The drum and singers kept a steady murmur . Beside the fire John 's father , Clayton , one of the two Sun Dance chiefs , sang along , wrapped in a red Pendleton . He raised first one bare foot , then the other over the embers , spreading his toes like a hawk grasping its prey . Those talons seemed to enter John 's body , invigorating him with the knife-like pain . Again John advanced toward the buffalo , bouncing on his feet . The singers ' voices surged , lifting and strengthening him , carrying him like the wind . The buffalo 's nostrils flared , puffing steam , and its eyes reddened and hardened with fury . John flew joyously . The animal hunched its shoulders , its bulk filling John 's sight . He danced into its face . Lowering its head , the buffalo charged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red eyes hated John , then the horns hooked him , tossing him skyward . <p> John 's body lay on the dirt beneath the stuffed head . The drummers pounded and sang . Clayton strolled back and forth beside the fire . <p> John looked up at the moon shining through humps of clouds , which were like buffalo lying down . The silver disc sliced an animal 's neck , separating the head from the body . Whistling , the head soared into space , a fiery comet among the stars . John entered the buffalo body and instantly felt both its earthbound mass and the head 's free , swooping flight among stars that were chunks of crystal . He woke laughing with joy and crawled to his bed of cool reeds . <p> On the final morning , the more than one hundred Crow men and women whistled up the sun with their eagle bones , their hands symbolically washing the first rays over their bodies . Songs were sung , the blessings of Akbaatatdia , the divine spirit , invoked by the Sun Dance chiefs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last time . Leaning his hand against it , he lit a cigarette , letting his prayers of thanks rise with the smoke to his friend the buffalo , up the fluttering cottonwood branches , and beyond . <p> Four chosen women entered barefoot , carrying water to each dancer . Just before the people formed two lines to pass from the Big Lodge , John caught Clayton looking at him , eyes filled with tears , and could n't help smiling back . Then Clayton turned and led the procession through banks of spectators to a table heaped with fresh fruit and drinks . John 's wife , Millie , stood proudly , on either side their son and daughter . Their hands reached for him and wrapped around his body . Millie cried on his shoulder . John closed his eyes , and the images pitched in his head , the buffalo , the moon , coals pulsing with the drum , green leaves waving against the blue sky . When he opened them , a very tall blond woman was staring across the swirl of dark heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lodge . John grinned at her before quickly averting his face . <p> Medicine <p> As daybreak had fired the colors within the Big Lodge-the varied greens of aspen and cottonwood leaves , brushy lodgepole needles , grass , the multihued Pendleton blankets draping the seated dancers-Clayton had raised his arms in prayer . It was the first morning 's sunrise service , thirty-six hours before John would confront the buffalo . First Clayton gave thanks for the return of sacred Crow relics , after an eighty-year exile , by the Smithsonian Institute . That had been the occasion for the Sun Dance . Then he prayed for the dancers , their families and tribe , the well-being of Indian people , and the rest of humanity . He prayed for the whites who , lured by the notoriety of the Smithsonian case , had journeyed hundreds of miles , hoping to " go in " ; no room , he 'd had to tell them . " Let our sacred Sun Dance , " he beseeched in Crow , " find its way into their lives , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for John , that at least this one of his sons would keep true to Crow way . <p> Saturday afternoon , the second full day of the Sun Dance , a line of barefoot supplicants passed into the Big Lodge to be doctored by Clayton or the other Sun Dance chief . While the patient placed both hands on the Center Pole , Clayton prayed , touched his medicine feathers to the trunk , and whisked them over the person , concentrating on the source of the ailment . Many improved on the spot , a limp straightening or emphysemic wheeze subsiding . A man only middle-aged but vacant and dribbling with Alzheimer 's was led by his daughter to the cottonwood . With the feathers close alongside the man 's head , Clayton drew out the sickness and scattered it to the east . " I 've never seen so many going into a Sun Dance , " the man remarked . " Rain coming , though . <p> The temperature had dropped twenty degrees under low black clouds , and wind swirled dust into the people 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspen enclosure . Thunder crashed on them , lightning ripping the clouds . A tree on the nearby ridge exploded , and minutes later a siren wailed from the BIA fire station , but a wall of rain blotted out the flames . The storm surrounded them , a chill mist gusting sporadically . At the rattle of approaching hail , the dancers drew their blankets over their heads . Above them , though , a circle of sky remained blue , and Clayton kept doctoring . Despite the storm 's rumbling , the sun broke through with an unearthly , streaming light that made all look as if they were rising up . Clayton 's voice shook with emotion as his prayer brought the healing to an end . Later it was learned that two-and-a-half inches had soaked the Arrow Creek Valley , not a drop in the Big Lodge . <p> For each petition Clayton spread his palm against the cottonwood and smoked . Dozens of cigarette butts clumped in the dirt at the base of the pole . He did n't doubt that his prayers would succeed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or supernatural that which to him was a simple fact of life . <p> Hours later , among the sleeping dancers in the near dark , Clayton received the final blessing of seeing his son " take a fall " beneath the buffalo head , and of feeling his own heart full to brimming . <p> Clayton 's first son described himself as " cosmopolitan , " a word Clayton knew only as the title of the women 's tit magazine . He 'd lived in San Francisco , Japan , the Virgin Islands , every time losing himself in drink , so that Clayton would have to go after him . " Dad threw out the lasso and drug that dogie home , " John would say . A Crow woman had him now , in Billings . He 'd helped cook frybread for the Sun Dance buffalo feast , organized by Clayton 's wife , Berenice . <p> The second son , who had dug the pit to roast the meat , worked for the tribe in Crow Agency . " He 's sound-headed , " Clayton told Berenice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a dud . " <p> John , the youngest , had shot the two bulls served at the feast . Already this triumph was legendary . After hours of driving , he and his father had tracked the tribal herd to a grassy plateau . By ritual law each hunter was allowed only one shot per animal , which must die from a single bullet . When the Crow game warden had missed at one hundred fifty yards , the herd had stampeded up a hill , two hundred , then two hundred fifty yards away . John fired , and a buffalo dropped . " Hit him just over the shoulder . I could see that bullet going the whole way , " he said , and shot again . " Neck , " he said as the second beast fell . Jumping up , he ran to the kill , leaping a stream along the way , waving his arms . Clayton knew that only spirit could have made those buffalo give their lives to him . <p> With the Sun Dance at an end , Clayton " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy cedar smoke , preparatory to wrapping and stowing them . The feathers , bequeathed to him by his father , had belonged to generations of powerful medicine men . After he 'd received them , it was five years before Clayton felt deserving to use them . He 'd gone in two , three Sun Dances a season , traveling state to state . The muscles of his chest had been torn by the Lakotas ' ritual piercing . Through vision quests he had scourged his body and spirit with hunger and cold to let the knowledge in . When this life left him and the feathers dropped from his hands , Clayton thought , only John 's hands could open to take them . <p> The Tutor <p> Clayton ladled water from the metal bucket onto the glowing rocks . Steam hissed , and John breathed deep , searing his lungs . He grunted with satisfaction . In the dark of the sweat lodge Clayton 's voice began its incantatory praying , reciting a litany of ills and sorrows endured by people that he never would meet . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a burlap sack served as Clayton 's PO. box . " It 's like to being Elvis , " Clayton said . Most consisted of touching , even heartbreaking pleas-for a dying child 's recovery , the return of a husband 's love . Stories of alcoholism and drug abuse . Clayton struggled through the English to get the gist . A New Mexico man asked for victory in his upcoming campaign for constable . People wanted help with their bad cars and backstabbing relatives . " Dear Abby , " Clayton said , but he prayed for them all , including the Rhode Island lady suffering from shingles ; the images puzzled him , of roofing materials buzzing her like angry insects , or her groaning face above gables protruding from her ribs . Maybe she was insane . In thanks , some letters enclosed cigarettes or even small billswelcome , as the Sun Dance had left the family in debt despite their selling off land . Clayton begged for the worthiness to carry these people 's hopes . <p> John switched his own back with willow twigs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouring , and he felt incandescent . After the prayer , meditating and drifting , Clayton and John would say whatever came into their heads . " I need the truck for Billings tomorrow , " John said . <p> " Pick me up a case of them motor oil , " Clayton said . " What are you doing in Billings ? " <p> " Finding a job . I need a place while I 'm taking classes . " After a pause Clayton said , " I did n't think you were really going to go ahead for that college . " <p> " I need them teaching me . I see plenty in my mind , but my hands . . . The kids do better drawings . " John laughed . Anger was impossible in the sweat , even at himself . The reason he 'd gone in the Sun Dance- " You got to have a reason , the Big Lodge ai n't the mall , " Clayton said-was his acceptance by Montana State-Billings , eleven years after high school , bad grades and all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A neighbor had helped him decipher the applications . The same man not only had praised the pictures , but bought one for twenty-five dollars . John could only shake his head in amazement . <p> " You ca n't leave Millie and the children all year , " Clayton said . <p> " I 'll bring ' em . " <p> " Your kids in a white school ? " Already , while comprehending Crow , the boy and girl responded in English . <p> With no reply John felt tight , closed in . The idea of obtaining his own income had excited him . All he earned from firefighting or repairing cars went straight to the family . He and Millie had lived with his parents for their entire marriage , eleven years . <p> " You have a place . With us , " Clayton said . Be a cold winter , hitching fifty miles from Arrow Creek to Billings and back every day , John did n't say . <p> " We 'll fix the old Toyota for you , have it to kicking up its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as John had trusted , the buffalo vision touched with grace his experience of college . He found all his classes . The white students would pause and explain to him in detail the campus layout , drawing maps . He was a sunny being , he felt , whose brief company pleased them . The way he moved exhilarated him , light , loose , kind of crooked like a dragonfly 's flight compared to their beeline marching . <p> Home , he painted boldly , uninhibited by his lack of skill . The tubes of acrylic released bombs of color , things not seen in this world . He might set a blue-faced warrior , mounted on a red horse , beside a yellow boomerang-like object suspended in the sky . Often , though he never would reproduce the sacred vision directly , buffalo and moons possessed the canvas , inspiring the other elements to follow them . His six-year-old son , Dan , sat at his feet while the pictures formed . " Ho , ' the boy exclaimed as an orange bolt split a mountain . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gripped and pushed him so that he felt he was painting with their collective mind . <p> Only Millie scarcely could take notice . She greeted his late arrivals in Arrow Creek with brusque sarcasm , until they went to bed . The past six years she 'd used a diaphragm , but now she teased him by pretending to throw it away . She was lean , with fine bones , pockmarked skin , and a rare , girlish smile . One night he embraced her with the diaphragm still in its case . Initially she went slack-they 'd agreed that Dan would be their last-but then she let herself go with him . Her legs scissored around his back as he whispered in her ear , " This baby will be born under good luck . <p> Lucky , lucky baby . " Assessing John 's torrid output as " highly promising , " the art professor gave him a studio key . <p> Academic courses , however , the English , math , history , were a nightmarish blindness . Lectures , textbooks-John comprehended nothing . Fluent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either haltingly or in desperate , helter-skelter bursts . While Millie , who kept the family 's account book , guided him through math homework , she could n't take his tests . The longer he waited for the blankness to lift , the worse it was . Three weeks into the semester he called Teresa Gundersen , the tall blond woman , in her forties , who had waited to glimpse him outside the Big Lodge . <p> The year before , after watching him fancy-dancing at Crow Fair , she 'd slipped him her phone number on her husband 's business card . His lobbying for the Montana timber industry generally kept him in Washington , D.C. , she said . <p> Less than an hour after he phoned , Teresa joined him in the studio where he was painting a green disembodied head . A horn grew beside one ear , balanced asymmetrically by a curly forelock . Powwow music thumped from a tape recorder . <p> " Stunning , " Teresa said , flinging up her arms . Her bosom strained against the buttons of her red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans . <p> " My professor told me I 'm running away from the field . So I look at him : Wha ' ? " John cocked his head . " It 's good . It 's good . " He laughed . <p> Teresa cased the studio , examining the various student pieces . " No competition , " she confirmed . John smiled in response to her small talk . " You sang at Crow Fair with your dad , " she said . " What are they saying ? " She indicated the tape player . <p> " It 's a forty-nine , love song , you know . Indian blues . " <p> " Sing me one . " <p> John clicked off the machine . Pounding a heavy cadence with his palm on his knee , he chanted two stately , loping verses . Teresa 's hands folded in her lap . " What does it mean ? " she asked humbly . <p> " Aha , do n't you want to know " John said . <p> " I 'm serious . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , let 's play this , then . I bought it at the mall . " She popped in the cassette . " Bulgarian women 's chorus : ' <p> At the first ethereal a cappella notes , John was transfixed . The crystalline dissonances went straight to his groin . The voices were naked angels , like a cottonwood stripped of its bark , more , a purer white than Earth could allow . He looked up at Teresa . Shy to betray desire , she leaned fidgety against the wall , a one-hundred-eighty-pound waif . <p> John danced her to the floor . The music took him away even while his body feasted . In thanks he kissed the woman 's breasts over and over . They were big enough to hide in . <p> It was while Teresa dressed that he said , " I had a question . " Opening his composition book , he pointed to " thesis . " " Is it more than one of ' these ' ? " <p> " Poor boy , " she said . " We 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within a few weeks John was passing all his courses but American history . Like many traditional Crows , he was unconcerned with strict chronology ; his father might state a given duration as " two month , maybe three years . " John could n't say if Lincoln freed the slaves before or after Martin Luther King . <p> Teresa drilled him in grammar , spelling , and math , besides negotiating extensions with his professors . She dictated his reports , and when that proved agony , typed them or wrote them out for him to copy . <p> Education pelted him like a gale with broken sticks and tossed leaves of knowledge . " Picasso , ah yes , Picasso , " he told Teresa . " The sad blue people , and bulls , analytic cubism made the illusion of the depth , synthetic cubism the picture is flat . . . ran , has run , will have been running . .

Then he felt a sharp regret , remembering how he loved the calmness in her face as she held a newborn to her breast . <p> But as the semester progressed and he returned later and later , the kids dozing in front of videos , waiting , Millie withdrew into silent rage . On a morning , actually near noon , when John splashed the sleep out of his head at the kitchen sink , Millie sat brutally beading a pair of deerskin boots , shoving a needle through the leather . <p> " It 's a shame , poor young wife , " Berenice said . " There 's a culture festival they 're doing down in Wyoming , " Clayton said , " and they 're wanting us to share our Crow dancing . " " Us " obviously included John . <p> John shook his head . " Midterms are the week after . " <p> " Good , " Berenice said . <p> " But I got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me you ca n't dance with us , " Clayton snapped in Crow . <p> The next day John packed a bedroll . " I 'm staying in Billings the next three days . Got to make up all that studying I 'm going to lose . Maybe sleep a little on the studio floor . " He drove away before anyone could stop him . Teresa rented them a motel room . <p> " Why do you cover up ? " John asked . Teresa had dragged the king-size sheet around her and into the bathroom , affording him only a peek at her snowy avalanche of flesh . <p> " I 'm a grandmother , " she said , trailing the sheet back to bed . <p> " No , you look young . Strong , " he said , flexing his arms . " Like one of them . " He indicated the track and field on TV . <p> " A shot-putter ? " <p> John laughed , not understanding . He 'd noticed that Teresa always claimed the last comment in any exchange , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kandinsky , whom John had adopted as his favorite artist , and she discussed the transition from Die Blaue Reiter to the Bauhaus . " Of course the war intervened . Franz Marc dying so young , a tragedy . Or the poets ! Brooke , Owen . " <p> " The Vietnam War ? " <p> " Did you know that people actually have been fighting wars since before you were born ? " <p> " Sure . The Crows fought the Lakota a long time . Ten years . " " Try a couple of centuries . " She even knew more about the oldtime Crows than he did , the society of men 's clubs , the ancient linguistic affinity between Crow and Lakota . " But Crow men always were the most beautiful , " she said . In bed , though , she lay stiff and shrinking as if hardly daring hope that he 'd touch her . He would straddle her , letting his cock and balls brush her belly , up her breasts to her chin and lips . Then she 'd sigh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightening her grip . She was very powerful , and her rolling on top gave him moments of real anxiety before his strength welled up to match her . He 'd decided to find nobility in her handsome , broken features , though the sight of her in bright day made him cold . <p> The culture festival was grim . Under a leaden sky , snow fell steadily . Since John 's three-day absence he and Millie had n't spoken , and the children were cranky , whining and stamping as he tied on their beaded leggings . The entire family , including his brothers and clan relatives , danced or sang with the drum . <p> John crouched and darted , ruffling his turkey-feather bustle . Against the monochrome afternoon the Crows , vivid in colored fabrics and cut-glass beadwork , plumes wagging , undulated like autumn foliage . Berenice wore an elk-tooth dress , Clayton full headdress and white buckskins . He beckoned the mixed Indian and white audience to join the Round Dance , in friendship . Dipping lightly into the crossover step that rotated the circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John wondered how friendly Clayton would feel when he learned Teresa 's request : to participate in a real Crow sweat . <p> The festival grand marshal presented T-shirts , seventy-fivebucks gas money for the three vehicles , and profuse gratitude . " Glad to do it , " Clayton said . " We know us Crows got something the world needs . World 's a pretty tore-apart place , like an old tepee ripped up by the wind , and the snow coming in . " <p> John waited midway through the long drive home to Arrow Creek before proposing Teresa 's wish . " She 's my tutor , " he explained . " I 'd be flunking without her . " <p> " This white woman breaking up your home does n't sweat in our lodge , " Clayton said . " She 's my teacher , that 's all . She gives me over and over . So I 'm just taking and taking , like sucking from a big tit ? " <p> To refuse would be inhospitable , Clayton admitted in Crow , expressionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusk , Teresa drove up in her new Scout . John 's footsteps crunched in the snow as he greeted her . Down by the creek a fire blazed , Clayton shoveling in the rocks that would cook the sweat lodge , a dome of blankets and old carpeting draped over bent willow poles . <p> " Dad 's running late , " John said . " He was hauling the rocks , and the truck got a flat tire . Oh , he was mad . ' John shook himself comically like a wet dog , nervous . All day he 'd endured , even joined his family 's jokes . " Tutor ? " his " cosmopolitan " brother Martin , had said . " The sweat 'll blister the toots out of her tooter . She 'll be lucky if she can sit on it . " But Millie , Berenice , and Martin 's woman would sweat with her . Berenice had promised to take care of her , translating the prayers , explaining how to breathe through cupped hands against the cool earth if the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Teresa asked Clayton , " Where 'd ya get the flat at ? " attempting an ingratiating folksy diction . <p> He gazed at her . " What ? " <p> Teresa repeated the question . <p> Removing his cap and turning it over in his hands , he said decisively , " My hat 's not flat , " and walked away . Amid the Crows ' roaring mirth , Teresa closed her eyes , face scarlet . Then Clayton got it . Laughing until the tears came , he patted her arm . <p> The women traipsed off to the sweat lodge . John realized his anxiety was for his friend 's pleasure , for the sweat 's spiritual benefit to enter her life . The thought of her joy snatched gladness out of him like a startling , gorgeous scarf from a magician 's empty sleeve . He could n't relax , shredding cigarette butts with his fingers while an hour passed . Hearing Teresa 's shriek he bolted up , recognizing only from the accompanying laughter that the women were bathing in the icy creek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Over steaks and potato salad Teresa expatiated on the differences between the Crow sweat bath and what she 'd read of Cree , Salish , and others ' practices . She shared gossip , courtesy of her husband , the lumber flack , about congressmen 's sexual escapades . She dropped names , a party at Mel Gibson 's ranch , an exclusive gala opening for the celebrated Crow artist Shane Two Bears . No one else spoke . " God , what a loudmouth , " Teresa said , muzzling herself , and rose to help Berenice clear the table . She joined the women washing the dishes . Though it was past midnight when they finished , neither Berenice nor Clayton invited her to spend the night . She hugged the women in farewell , towering over them . <p> Scarcely had the Scout 's engine turned over when Millie said , " Hulk Hogan . " The family cracked up . Berenice 's shoulders shook . <p> " Da Crow sweat . . , " Martin bellowed , assuming a grappler 's stance , chest puffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted , " She 's a genius .

" She 's not bony like you . Bony woman ! This whole year I 'm going to school , " he continued in English , " you 're just bony . Sticking me any time . You 're like a " - he found the word- " skeleton to me . " Clayton ordered them quiet . John slept on the couch . The next morning Clayton said Berenice would need John 's Toyota for a week or more while he took the truck hunting back in the mountains . <p> " What do I do ? " John said . <p> " Help me , " Clayton said . <p> John phoned Teresa . He collapsed his easel , rolled up his canvases , and tucked them in a gunnysack . <p> " You ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Millie took the children to her mother 's . Berenice was crying . When Teresa braked in the drive , John flung the sack over his shoulder . Clayton blocked his way , a compact six feet standing slightly bowlegged , hands dangling . Under his shock of black hair , his eyes held John . Like a sleepwalker John swept past him , the sack bumping his father 's arm . <p> Teresa rented him a one-bedroom apartment near the campus . That night John dialed home from a pay booth , asking for Clayton . <p> " He 's hunting , " Berenice said . <p> " I called to say I 'm sorry for walking out , " John said in a trembling voice . " He 's got to understand , I ca n't leave school . " <p> Berenice sighed . " He ai n't feeling well . " <p> John took off walking , hat pulled low against the cold . Up the steep escarpment known as the Rim , he hiked , past the fake day of the luminous but nearly deserted airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mall . The wind burned his cheeks . In an intersection he saw Clayton , red Pendleton and Sun Dance skirt undisturbed by accelerating cars . Clayton 's hand clenched over his heart , thumping his breastbone . Then he vanished . Tears iced John 's lashes , fuzzing his vision into bright blobs and wispy shadows . He strode on aching legs , awaiting whatever would happen to him , his heart maybe . He imagined it leaping from his chest , pumping on the sidewalk . When morning came he felt like stone , some strong new stone dug from the earth , yet to be named . He brewed coffee in his new home and went to class . <p> Just before Christmas break Clayton knocked at the apartment , handing John the keys to a full-ton Ford pickup only two years old . " So you can get home , " he said . Millie had moved to her new job in Crow Agency , but the kids visited some weekends and holidays .

Berenice served roast venison . Clayton hauled out the drum , and the men sang , warmed by the fire , before a midnight sweat . Lying on his back , inhaling the scalding steam , John felt the knots in his musclesthe stress from finals , his incomprehensible textbooks , the whole concrete claustrophobia-melt away into the ground . Before rinsing in the creek , he and his father stood under the cloudshrouded moon as slow , fat snowflakes dissolved on their steaming bodies . <p> The children were standoffish at first , and Trina , eleven , conscientiously refrained from calling him Dad . " Take me for ice cream , John . " <p> " Millie 's poisoning them against me , " John said . <p> " What do you expect ?

While the family shopped in Billings , they stole an afternoon together in their old room , fucking with the desperate , tittering carnality , and self-pity , of illicit lovers . <p> " I missed you so much it told me something , " Teresa said three weeks later , when he returned to the city . " I 'm leaving Captain Clear-cut . After twenty-three years . Goodbye half-million-dollar house on the Rim . Farewell cook and maid . Etc . " <p> " So where you living ?

' Sounds as if flowers are conquering Europe . " Coaching math , she leaned her expanse of face into his , counting loudly on her parsnip-size fingers . <p> " If I 'm so stupid , why are you bothering with me ? " John said . <p> " Oh , baby . " Her hands covered her face . " Oh , John baby . " She rocked back and forth . Kneeling , she pushed her head into his lap so he scarcely could understand her . " I 'm scared , " she said .

" <p> In her words John suddenly knew himself . Always something had divided him from others-Millie , his children , mom , and brothers , even his dad . Teresa had named it . It was as if he 'd been lost his whole life and now recognized his own woods . He was a great boulder brilliant with red , orange , green lichen , encircled by trees whose roots twined around him like veins from a heart . You were so long finding us , the holy trees said , but now you 're here . Swept by gratitude , John said , " Let 's get married . " <p> Teresa lifted her head . " So sweet . " She rubbed her knuckles against his cheekbones . " Of course we 're both married already , but screw the details .

Composition dynamic , colors bold but harmonious , brushstrokes deft , the painting was completed in less than an hour , and John emerged as if from a dream . " That 's the painter you 'll be a year from now , " his professor said . " And after that- " He spread his hands wide . <p> If he were to continue visiting home , John said , Teresa must come , too . Millie vanished altogether . The family 's revenge was to make Teresa a servant . If Clayton needed a gasket from Billings , <p> " Send Hulk , " and away drove the Scout . After dinner the Sees the Hills would rise abruptly and retire to the living room , abandoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And nights I lie with beauty , " she said . <p> The Rendezvous <p> Almost a year after the Sun Dance , Clayton 's celebrity persisted . An item in The National Enquirer featured his " transcontinental healing " by mail , referring to the " miracle " of the encircling thunderstorms having spared the Big Lodge . Anthropology students had camped on his lawn the previous week . <p> But since the moment the past winter when John had brushed past him , sack over his back , to Teresa 's waiting Scout , a stone had lodged in Clayton 's gut . It blocked his breathing and would n't let him shit more than every three or four days . <p> " I 'll run that Hulk out of here , " Berenice had threatened more than once . <p> " We 'll lose him , " was Clayton 's reply . Now , the horses kneedeep in midsummer green pasture , John emerged past eleven every morning , yawning in low-slung cutoffs , to paint . Last night an outrage : a clan uncle staying over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself and John for the rollaway couch . But after dinner they grabbed and tickled each other into the kids ' bedroom . For hours Trina and Dan waited up , bleary and redeyed in front of the TV , before passing out on the couch . Outside the closed door Clayton would begin to speak , and the stone would paralyze him , stick his mouth open . Picking at his toast and eggs , he felt flaccid with age . Across the table Teresa chainmunched bacon . <p> " Today whenever he shows his face he makes his own damn breakfast , " Berenice said . " Too late for that one , already ate the whole pig . " She jerked away Teresa 's dish with a peal of cutlery . <p> Teresa rapped the family 's black ledger , which she 'd taken over in Millie 's absence . " A shambles , " she said . Cashing in the last holdings over by Yellowtail Dam would square the Sun Dance debts , but what then ? Sell out the land from under their own house ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In fact the interest rates are extortionary . Racist . We could sue : ' <p> " Things have a way of working out ; ' was all Clayton could say . John bounded in , freshly showered and sleek as an otter . " Surprise , " he said , winking at Teresa . " A gallery in Red Lodge is hanging my watercolor , Creation Myth . We can go ? " <p> Clayton welcomed the distraction . The entire family , even a resistant Berenice , piled into the pickup . Red Lodge was an hour away . The painting attracted a knot of viewers . " Look at that , " John said , pointing to the price tag , $375 . Teresa beaming at his side , he answered questions . <p> " My Crow way keeps my feet on Mother Earth , " he explained . " But my art talent flies all over the universe . But they 're both the same . <p> On their way out of town , they noticed a sign for the Beartooth Mountain Man Rendezvous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em happy " Clayton told John . <p> A rutted dirt road led up the plateau , where the mountainmen 's encampment of booths , log lean-tos , and tepees spread over several acres . But admission was five dollars apiece . <p> " Just wait , " Clayton said . Claiming to be " one of your Crow dancing performers , " he crashed a board of directors dinner , barbecue-chowing , buckskin-clad men glinting with wire-rims and Rolexes . <p> " I 'm looking at your what's-happening on your paper , and I do n't see anything about the Crow Indians that live here many tens of hundred years , " Clayton said . While he negotiated , his family was invited to browse the exhibits , then share the barbecue . The Mountain Man Society president , topped with a coonskin cap , questioned him with keen , squinting regard . <p> " The Sun Dance doll that the Smithsonian company was handing over to the Crow tribe , " Clayton said , " my great-great-grandfather owned it . That 's why it was up to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Originally the Sun Dance was a vengeance ritual , the doll a fetish with the power , if used properly , to help kill one 's enemy . White administrators suppressed the ceremony for generations . " This Sun Dance now is thanking the Creator for getting through some hard time , for good luck . It 's gathering up a heavy spirit force for the people . " Clayton shook his head . " Big , big spirit . Like a tornado ! " <p> " In the old days , then , " the president said , " the Big Lodge meant bloodshed . " <p> " Crows killing everybody . " Clayton nodded solemnly , then guffawed . " Scared him now ! " He drew the edge of his hand across the man 's neck . " No , like Chief Plenty Coups told us back in 191o , 18oo 's something , white is coming , and no one 's chasing him off , might as well learn to live with him . What the Crows have , the Creator is giving it to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thing we 're looking at here is heritage , " Clayton said . " I know my relatives as long ago as when you Pilgrims back there is getting ready to eat that Indian corn and smoke that Indian tobacco . Some say the mountain lion and the eagle is our relatives . This man- " He patted the president on the shoulder . <p> " What people you from ? " <p> " Polish . " <p> " All right , Polish . You speak Polish ? You do your Polish dances at this rendezvous ? You and your wife and children wear your Polish clothes to church ? " <p> " I got them mountain men pretty down in the mouth , " Clayton said , rejoining the Sees the Hills , who were watching flintlock marksmen blast a stuffed deer . " They look around like they got empty hands . Hell , we ai n't got no heritage : " <p> Not only had Clayton been elected to the board of directors , but the Crows were hired to dance every afternoon for the next two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a tourist attraction ? " Teresa said . <p> " Did n't I tell you something would come along , bookkeeper lady ? The white wants to give back to us , I do n't push it away . " <p> At sundown , the Sees the Hills , honored overnight guests , were shown to their tepee . It was oddly squarish , the fabric stiff , sporting a leering thunderbird . <p> " Tepee Motel 6 , " Clayton said . <p> The Crows were a hit . Admissions nearly doubled for their shows . The dance troupe had shrunk , as Clayton 's Arrow Creek neighbors , skeptical of his renown-they called him " the little god " - shied away . But his most profound satisfaction was bringing his own family together again . Drying out after a binge , Martin drummed with shaking hands , grasping the stick as if it were pulling him out of quicksand . Gerald , the son from Crow Agency , sang despite his bad luck . His wife had been hospitalized for a jumping eye , and driving home from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign . Feathers twined in his braids hid the neck brace which had put him on sick leave . <p> Long before , Teresa had booked what turned out to be the gig 's second week for her annual vacation in Colorado , with her daughter 's family . Immediately after she left , John fetched Millie , though she had a new boyfriend . She spoke downcast , inaudibly . Afternoons she whipped into her shawl dance with fringe flying , face drawn . John stalked tautly , a stealthy warrior . Otherwise , the most Clayton saw of them was their backs growing tiny as they walked hand in hand toward the surrounding woods . <p> " So , what happens when Hulk comes back ? " Clayton heard in his mind . " Some nights , when the snow piles up over the windows week after week , Berenice and I get mean , sitting across that lonely table , killing each other with our eyes . Still we 're together thirty , forty years . " But when he faced John his tongue was a dead stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president shadowed Clayton , questioning and jotting notes . He was an author of popular regional histories and fictional biographies of personages such as the explorer-priest Father De Smet and trappers Jim Bridger and Old Bill Williams . " One based on Crazy Horse , " he said . " Sioux Marauder . At least that 's how they thought of him at the time . " The last day of the rendezvous , he insisted on a tour of the gallery displaying John 's watercolor . <p> An hour later , Berenice tugged Clayton 's shoulder , alarmed . John was running full-tilt through the camp , dodging carts and bonneted matrons . " He wants my picture for his book cover , " he shouted . The author had assured John that his publisher would pay at least a thousand for the rights to Creation Myth . " I ca n't believe it . Ohhh . " John smacked his forehead . He paced the tepee like a lunatic . Millie could n't calm him . " Jeez . " He hit himself again . <p> John began the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Millie to Crow Agency , an arrangement that lasted until he flunked his first midterm . He moved into Teresa 's apartment . Millie packed up again . <p> On Clayton 's answering machine , purchased against the encroachments of fame , a girl 's message piped , " Sir ? I 'm in Mr. John Sees the Hill 's art history class ? I mean , he does n't teach the class , but we 're in it together . I ... " The voice stammered away into nothing and hung up . Clayton erased it . <p> Calls from New York , a Helen Feld , assistant art director for the mountain man 's publisher , were to be saved . The dust jacket illustration was a done deal . Still she phoned both the apartment and the house , even on weekends . <p> The Sees the Hills and Teresa were seated for dinner when she rang . John settled into an easy chair , leg over the armrest . He chuckled softly into the receiver . " I 'm a simple Indian man , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shook the phone . <p> " She said she had to catch her breath , " he told his listeners afterward . " She said , I 'm melting . " ' <p> The Gift <p> " Do you have slides of your work ? " Helen had managed to continue . <p> " Oh yes , yes , " said John , who did n't , but was certain Teresa could arrange for them . <p> " I 'd like to see them . I have friends who would like to see them : ' <p> By March , during his second year of art studies , John would be adding to his book cover a one-man show in New York . Helen scheduled the opening for his spring break . <p> He was infatuated with her voice , the nasal vowels , their strange liquid music like the buckling of a saw cutting wood . He imagined she might be Chinese . <p> " You 're probably married , " she said . <p> " Separated . " <p> " I 'm sorry . I have a boyfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wildly jealous , he ransacked his English , retorting with an old TV commercial . " Me ? You ca n't pinch an inch . " <p> " I 'll just bet . " A gloating silence ensued . <p> " When we 're quiet I can really feel you at the other end " he said . <p> " Home in Pennsylvania I have a favorite niece who sleeps over with me , " she said . " Every morning we do each other 's hair . Hers flows halfway down her back . Mine . Ha ! Takes two hours , and then if the humidity changes it falls like a souffle . She 's all love for the planet . PBS had a program on vampire bats being poisoned for killing cattle . She cried her little heart out . For the horrible , crawling bats . What 's your favorite wildlife where you are , Aunt Helen ? ' ' I saw a squirrel once . Giant rat with a bushy tail . I would 've hit it with my purse if it had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> As the departure for New York approached , he painted in such a prolific frenzy , the surfaces so large , that he and Teresa would have gone broke replenishing acrylics and oils , not to mention framing , had not Clayton chipped in . He had tapped a steady market for the dance troupe 's services , the most lucrative engagement a nearby off-rez town 's centennial parade . " Thank you , white people , helping send my boy to college , " he announced . <p> The painting most admired by John 's family , the huge Grandmother Storyteller , billowed across the canvas brown and red , the whole daubed with the colored handprints of schoolchildren he was teaching as a visiting artist . He also posed Teresa nude in various contortions . Since his brief reconciliation with Millie , Teresa was dull , resigned and dogged in her affections , unrepentant in her contemptuous flicks . " It 's okay to speak English , honey , " she said of his gnarled attempt to define conceptual art . She indulged his " phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crows referred to Helen as " Melting Woman . " <p> Of course the buildings loomed monstrously above crushing human mobs . But John 's dominant sensation , his first hours in New York , was that he could n't feel the ground . Anywhere . " I 'm going to fall off the world , " he said . <p> " Never thought of it that way , " Helen said , nodding . She 'd met them at the airport . " Figure right under here " - she stamped on the sidewalk- " there 's subway . " Noise and heat escaped a metal grate . " Two levels . Nothing but concrete and steel and pissy air a long , long way down . " <p> From the publishing house she 'd wangled a donation to cover three nights ' lodging for the entire family , including Teresa , so they could perform at the opening . In return , the gallery would sell the book featuring John 's cover art . " Look , " Helen admitted . " The gallery 's a basement , ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognoscenti , it 's got cachet . " <p> Saturday occupied them uncrating and hanging the artwork . The opening that night was thronged , though overshadowed in the media by a Shane Two Bears show uptown . " Damned luck , " Helen said . " Two Crow painters opening the same week ? God 's an old white bastard who has n't forgiven you for Custer . " <p> " Crows scouted for Custer , " Clayton said , but Helen had flitted away , glad-handing newcomers before prodding them back to John . Helen ! In moon-white makeup and heavy eyeliner , she turned to John the face of a startled animal . Her coif , candy-apple red , was teased straight up into an inverted flag of pubic hair . Her earrings quivered . Perfume , hairspray . Round hips swiveled her short legs into a voluptuous scurrying . She baffled his senses into a happy swimming . <p> The conversational hubbub added to his delirium . A blondmaned woman in black , legs planted wide , hands clasped behind her tailbone , stared at his painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface . Faces surrounded him , opening and closing mouths . He gave out short answers , smiles , and nods . He wore a suit and tie , bought by Teresa , and a hundred-dollar black Stetson , given by his father , which he 'd adorned with a single white feather . The other Crows were in traditional costume , Clayton the white buckskins . At a signal from his father , John squatted by the drum and began whacking the heartbeat cadence . Clayton sang , joined by the family , then led the entire assemblage , spilling champagne on their evening clothes , in a snaking dance . The drum ceased ; the dancers came to a standstill looking stunned , beatific . Clayton stretched his arms . " Aho . " <p> " Aho , " the congregation echoed . <p> " This is fun , " John told his father . " Let 's stay some extra days . " <p> " Good , " Clayton said in Crow , clasping his shoulder . Teresa and John 's brother Gerald would be returning home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family having booked a flight Wednesday , planning to foot the extra hotel bill . " Hulk will know what to do , " Clayton said . <p> John shook his head vehemently . " You know what she 'll think . Pussy . Her . " He indicated Helen . " Let her wait and get mean after we 're home . Ask Martin . " No prob , Martin said , just exchange the tickets . <p> Helen expertly mediated John 's conversations , waiting , as he untangled his incoherencies , with such patient expectancy that his listeners relaxed , not noticing the gaps . He spoke confidently , experimenting with his tie , coiling the silk around his fingers and letting it unfurl like a frog 's tongue . When he and Helen drew together , talking , their foreheads almost bumped . Teresa loomed nearby , stolidly sorrowful . <p> " Who 's the roller-derby queen ? " Helen said . " She 's awfully protective . ' <p> " That 's Hulk Hogan . Family friend . " <p> Attendance dwindled . Helen tried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Where 's your man ? " John asked . <p> She shook her head . " He only comes out for Chinese dissidents . Solzhenitsyn . He 's a . . . convenience . He takes me places I like to go . He 's always badgering me to move in with him . " Suddenly she said , " It 's over . " She smiled and unsmiled . She wiped her eyes , mascara running . John hugged her , stock-still in the emptying basement . " Can you come home with me ? " she said . <p> She hailed a cab for the family . <p> " Taking me out for dinner , " John said . <p> Helen 's West Village apartment betrayed the stylistic dissonance of its four renters , geometric polymer stools abutting a Queen Anne couch , Frida Kahlo sharing the wall with the anguished Han Solo frozen in carbonite . The three roommates lined the couch in their PJs like daughters awaiting a goodnight kiss as Helen swept John past and shut the door behind them . <p> She kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed randomly a magazine from the nightstand and read him , in a calm tone over hiccupping breaths , critic Arthur Danto on Mantegna . Droplets fell from her nipples . His cock stuck straight out between them . When they began again , he ground his head into the pillow , with pleasure , her pussy closing around him . They moved apart and stood by the window . Below , lives passed slowly in cars . An arm extended from a black sedan , exchanging for a blood-red splash of flowers an eyebrow of folded currency . A youth jumped the bumpers and was honked to the other side of the street . " I wish we had sweetgrass , " John said . " I 'd like to smell that burning right now . " They rocked each other on the bed . He was blacking out . The springs chittered . He slapped at her belly and thighs , not to hurt but to love her both ways , as pure flesh and as Helen , so that he broke free into a despair of wanting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her made him sick to his stomach until he came , washed dean and empty . " Shit , I 'm happy , " she said again and again . <p> Led by Martin , the family bussed to the apartment only a half hour late for brunch , Sunday noon . Helen had prepared the spread . The awestruck roommates served the Crows . Clayton was telling an old-time story . " And so it 's the wagon coming through the gap , and the children fall out the back . The hoot owls take them children , and it 's maybe five , ten year they keep them . The hoot owls raise them babies . " <p> " Hoodows ? Is that a tribe ? " Helen asked . <p> " Hoot owls . Hoot . Owls . Loving God , what a simpleton , " Teresa exclaimed . " I beg your pardon . I could swear someone who is eating my food-no small amount of it , I see-just spoke rudely to me . You 're welcome to finish your meal on the doorstep . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bedroom . Helen followed . While Clayton resumed his story , John strained to hear the women 's voices , Teresa 's spiraling upwards and downwards in pitch , Helen 's interjections increasingly subdued , but he could n't discern <p> " Liar ! " Helen said . " You 're not the first ; she says . When you 're through he 'll be back . ' She looked hollow , no person inside . It was horrible . Then she rears over me as if she 's going to attack me . Liar : ' She kicked him . " Your woman came all the way to New York with you . Go take her . " <p> Brunch adjourned hastily . John expected Teresa would n't fly , but the next morning she and his brother caught the subway for Kennedy . " I wo n't get in your way , " she said . <p> Helen , when he phoned her office , addressed him as Mr. Shahof-Persia . " I 'm all for multiculturalism , " she said , " and I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Helen the harem stops here . The lying stops here . Is that clear ? " <p> " Yes , " John said . <p> " It 's spoiled , but maybe it will come back . I love you , I ca n't help myself . " <p> " I love you , " John said . <p> She would see him the following night . <p> Clayton was grave . He had learned the hotel 's rates . But he 'd found an Indian shop listed in the Yellow Pages , on Fifth Avenue . While Martin exchanged the airline tickets , he and John would pay their respects to the New York Indians . <p> Sightseeing , Clayton 's head swiveled , his large brown hands darting and weaving as if conjuring from thin air the turbaned visages , heaven-seeking glass pinnacles , belching buses , Amazon women furred to the pelvis and naked below , a faraway spiderweb bridge dissolving in the foul air . John traipsed in a black mood . Love pulled him down . Everything about Helen mattered , her flushed earlobe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bat-loving niece in Pennsylvania . He worried about the fate of bats on the planet . The death of even one would hurt the little girl . It was unbearable . Sheer admiration for Helen oppressed him . He could n't wait out the hours until her soft push against him , for her disappointment or accusation , anything she might feel towards him . Most , he needed her to want him again . <p> Moon Lodge was nearly lost in the jumble of signs , the storefronts and eateries jamming together . Then , through the pervasive aroma of spicy grilled meats , John detected smoldering sweetgrass . Inside , bins overflowed with sage , cedar , herbs . Stacked powwow cassettes . A buffalo-hide rug . Indian men lounging at the counter half-nodded in greeting . <p> Introductions followed , with handclasps all around . " Old Muskrat , he lives here off and on , sleeps in the back room , " the proprietor said . Old Muskrat and a couple of others seemed pretty beat up , clothes filthy and drooping , stinking of sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife studied at NYU , opened sodas for the Crows . Clayton uncovered the inevitable links in the Indian network . He had finished second to the Arapaho 's uncle in traditional dancing , Rocky Boy Powwow , in 1978 . As a fire crew chief in 1981 , he had led Old Muskrat from a ravine moments before it vaporized in a clap of flame . " Knew I recognized you , " he lied kindly . " Ever since we come off this jet , " he said , " I 've been thinking , Where do you sweat in this New York ? " <p> " Sauna at the YMCA , " a customer said . " Not hot enough , and we ca n't pour because it shorts out the heater . But I pray . They do n't look at me funny anymore . " <p> " My son 's rich lady got a little land , " Clayton said . " Come over tomorrow night , we build a lodge there The shopkeeper promised a load of rocks . Clayton left practically skipping . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John bound for Helen 's . She smiled him in the door but gently deflected his hand from her waist . " Best just talk tonight , " she said . <p> " I did n't mean to lie . It was true to me , " John said . " I saw you at the airport and . . . bam ! Hulk was n't my woman . Hulk was n't even on the world . " <p> " And it slipped your mind to tell her . " <p> Berenice was frantic when John returned to the hotel . Ten p.m. , and no word from Martin . <p> " Cosmopolitan . Knows his way around , " Clayton muttered . <p> " I 'm calling the police , " Berenice said . <p> " Do you remember when Martin sold the shotgun for a half gallon of scotch , and you locked him in the toolshed ? " John said . <p> " I 'm working not to remember that , " Clayton said . <p> By morning Berenice had satisfied herself that Martin was n't dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone Helen confirmed that Martin could have sold the airline tickets , illegally . They could bus home , she suggested , cheaper than new flights at short notice . <p> " I do n't know if you could be lending us the money until John sells some of them paintings , " Clayton said . <p> Helen took personal leave and moved the Sees the Hills into her apartment , giving the parents her bed . " The money . I 'm not cheap , " she told John privately . " But it 's not by preference that I brush my teeth elbow-to-elbow with three others every morning . " <p> The Arapaho 's stones arrived on his borrowed flatbed . The Indian men hauled them through the foyer , prompting an appearance by the landlord , who lived in the basement . The fire pit to heat them would be a code violation , he said . That stymied everyone until Helen remembered a potter with an electric kiln across the way . <p> The common , overlooked by Helen 's kitchen window , was a wretched patch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edged in dingy concrete , enclosed by apartments ' birdlime-smeared backsides . While the Arapaho returned the truck , the stones baked , and the sweat lodge was erected from chairs , broom handles , blankets , and old rugs . Nightfall , the men went in , taking runs pouring and praying , the city Indians in English . Afterward they lolled behind a screen rigged from sheets , singing to where the moon would be if they could have seen it . <p> Lights went on , heads thrusting from windows . <p> " Real Indian sweat bath , five dollars " Clayton called . " Fundraiser , send the Indians home . " <p> " You ca n't get money , " John said , looking at his father in disbelief . " This holy thing . " <p> " Collection plate in church , " answered Clayton , who like most of the Arrow Creek community attended services as well as practicing native religion . <p> " It 's bogus , brother , " the Arapaho said . <p> " New York takes two hundred , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clayton said . <p> The Moon Lodge contingent left hurriedly . <p> Helen 's household sweated free , with Berenice . The sheets offered little protection from an overhead view , and by the time the women pranced into the building , wrapped in towels , each face a sundae of streaked makeup , several jostling , cheering men had gathered . Clayton collected five a head . " It will help them more than a movie , " he told John . " Do it . " <p> As John 's ladle spewed up the first blast of steam , his party wheezed and roared and plunged forward against the ground . He smelled alcohol . Though he was a veteran of a thousand far hotter sweats , these mild vapors burned his lungs and throat , made him want to jump out of his skin . Pressing his head to the questionable earth brought no relief His voice droned interminably as if it belonged to someone else . He wished it did . Finally freed , he hurled the ladle at Clayton 's feet . " No more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the landlord , who demanded and received a cut of the profit . <p> Meanwhile , John had blundered into the darkened living room , momentarily flicking on the light to locate Helen on their mat . Above the quilt her shoulders were bare , face blinking , rapturous . Even as he shed his clothes , her hand lazily skimmed his leg . <p> " I 'm sick with myself , " he said . <p> Her insinuating fingers became practical , tender . " I did n't understand what the dispute was all about , " she said . <p> " My dad would n't tell me to do anything wrong . " But the words were wispy , empty as ash . For the first time he noticed that his father had shrunk to a very small man , no higher than John 's knee . John wavered as if he had nothing to reach out for , to hold him up . He felt at the ends of his hands for Arrow Creek , for lodgepole pines bent under snow , the sharp reports of branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him , too . The Big Lodge did n't exist , nor the creek itself , into which Clayton had thrown whole venison steaks and potato salad in thanks for the life-giving water . The skyscrapers were real . A helicopter flew over rooftops , its chop-chop-chop momentarily louder than the din from canyons of traffic . He embraced Helen , who was everything . <p> Clayton winced throughout the next day and once hopped . " You get Helen to give you medicine for that plug-up bowel , " Berenice said . His face was flashing light and dark like neon . <p> Helen came home elated . The gallery owner would buy the monumental Grandmother Storyteller himself and pay immediately . Even minus commission , that clinched the bus . Otherwise , only a lithograph had sold , $175 . " Everybody loved the art , " she said . " But Two Bears is today 's Indian meal ticket . That 's the market . ' <p> " Please , let us stay for the weekend to find Martin , " Berenice said . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Helen beckoned John , whispering . " Not the old man , ' he said . " <p> " You missed your plane , " Martin blubbered . He 'd awakened that morning in a hotel bed . " Ni-i-ice , " he intoned . " Canopy , with fringe . " But they 'd thrown him out because the money was gone . <p> Come to Helen 's , John directed . <p> Martin wore a new silk shirt under his jacket . Clayton knocked him to the floor . Shrieking , Berenice rushed between them , pushing Clayton 's chest . He waded through her and , as Martin rose from his knees , slugged him down again . " Get that bad spirit out of my sons , " he panted , hands dubbed . John and Helen walked him to the couch . Clayton 's fist was clammy . Martin 's gaping mouth bled into the carpet . Speaking for the freaked-out roommates , Helen asked the Sees the Hills to leave the next evening . She 'd take the day off , for John . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Crow woman in childbirth , which he 'd titled Earth Mother . <p> " Not my niche , two abortions later , " she said , grimacing . <p> John was stunned . " You killed those little babies ? " <p> " Wait a minute , Almighty Loving Papa , where are your kids ? " " Millie . " <p> " The mother . And how often do you see them ? " <p> John was silent . Then he said , " When Dan was five , he could skin a deer . " <p> " Well , around here the kindergartners just flay each other , " she said . " All those kids nobody wanted but were born anyway , " she added . <p> " Together we can put back one of those babies . I want to stay here with you . " <p> Helen smiled and shut her eyes . " Mmm . I just wanted to feel that all over me . You finish school . My lover is no dropout . I 'll come to you , I promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MOMA . Stubbornly he insisted he wanted only to see the Shane Two Bears show . <p> Two Bears painted traditional Crow warriors exclusively , in gouache . Through invisible brushstrokes his palette played minute variations on earth tones , then ranging into rose-petal red and the blues of dusk . Pelage and plumage were scratched directly into the paint . Relentlessly energetic , the figures slung themselves beneath galloping ponies , slithered through buffalo grass , pounced from ambush . The hint of caricature in their features made them not comic but more-craggier , fiercer . <p> The artist himself usually dropped by afternoons if they cared to wait , the saleswoman said . <p> " He 's a kind of cousin to me , " John said , knowing the exact relationship only in Crow . <p> " Cousin " is what Two Bears boomed in a magnificent orator 's bass a half hour later . " Is this all an illusion ? " His wide-flung gesture encompassed at least Manhattan , if not the Atlantic seaboard . " Are n't we really in the Beartooths , horsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodgepoles for our tepee at Crow Fair ? " He was big , in jeans and a Pendleton shirt , with wirerims and a sparse , silky mustache . <p> John explained . <p> " First-rate , " Two Bears said , promising to view John 's show immediately . " For now , we toast with champagne . " <p> " I do n't drink , " John said . " Good for you . " <p> Riding the bus downtown , John said , " I might as well cut my hands off . " <p> " He can paint those in his sleep and probably does , " Helen breathed in his ear . Her tongue tip became an absence , the dampness in an empty bed . In the aftermath of New York , John received a box from Helen weekly . One was a black Italian silk shirt , another a sumptuous volume of Kandinsky , then pine cones from her Pennsylvania hometown . <p> Clayton shit blood , so that Berenice , who scarcely had spoken to him since the attack on Martin , drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined nothing . He sat outdoors on sunny days , his face paled to granite . <p> Berenice and Martin treated themselves to margaritas at La Placita in Billings , which featured an enclosed patio with a Spanish-speaking parrot . Once , her right leg stepped hip-deep into the fish pond . <p> John 's home had changed . Spirits had retreated from the mountains ' shaggy evergreen brows into the fastness of the range . <p> Up-thrust sandstone turrets , whose conversations of light with the shifting weather had delighted him , were lumps of geology , another course he was failing . The sun spangling through new spring foliage hurt his eyes with a dazzling pallor that reminded him of death . <p> He thought only of Helen , who was chopped off from him . He wondered if she could forget him during her job . He imagined her smothered in the arms of the fat , hairy cook or whatever he was , and he ran around half-crazy . He feared she secretly disrespected him because his show had been defeated by Shane Two Bears : His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nudes of her-all he painted-abandoned the customary fanfare of his palette for grays and sepias bleeding into the umbra of the black background . <p> During the hour or so on the phone with her , he was eager , happy . He was calling her every day until she told him she could n't afford it . They tried to plan . " I do n't know what I could do in Billings , " she said . " I 'm an art history major . " If he boosted his grades , he could transfer second semester the following year , perhaps to NYU . <p> But he 'd fallen too far behind after the week in New York , then the days bussing across the continent . Having pledged to avoid Teresa completely , he failed all but studio art . He pitied his bad luck loving a doomed abortionist , a love he would follow to its bad end . Come , marry me , he pleaded . <p> Busting her savings , Helen flew out for a week in July . The Sees the Hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sunset from the backyard , was a family activity . Berenice followed her and John . Gerald brought a venison haunch . Perked up by the obligation to be hospitable , Clayton spun tales of history and legend in his inventive , sometimes guilefully misleading English . <p> " Your father is brilliant , " she told John , " but he 's on tighter than my diaphragm . I check under the bed for him . " If she moved to Montana , Helen said , they must rent an apartment , which John would split ; her earning power would be zero . " I recognize that blank look , Mr. Artist-Chief . You would n't fall down dead with a regular job . " <p> " There 's women in my classes want to buy me a house , " he said . " My English teacher says take her cabin for a studio . " He winced saying this , a pain in the cheek as sharp as when he 'd hooked himself fishing . <p> " Nice , " she said , then huskily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent want and played meditatively with each other 's hands , as if making up for what they 'd forgotten , though they 'd had sex many times . <p> Suffering Helen 's absence was like swimming in numbing black water , his limbs heavier and heavier until at times he simply wanted to stop . He got in a fistfight with Gerald , cursed his father . Berenice threw him out for a week . On matchbook covers , he painted parts of his body , nipple , cock , birthmark , and sent them to Helen . <p> She prevailed on him to enroll for fall semester . He must be tutored , he said . Teresa had agreed to a neutral site , the student union lobby . " Do n't worry . I love you , " he told Helen . <p> If her call did n't find him home , Helen became abusive , words he had n't heard her use . She wept and apologized . " I 'm buying something special . Based on your costumes , " she said mysteriously . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard secondhand from Berenice . " It 's a box . Phew ; I say , and the post office holds her nose . ' I thought you 'd never pick it up ; post office says , and I say , I 'm going to bury the stinky thing in the ground : But before I do , I cut it open , and it knocks me over . Phawgh . It 's a rotten dead bird covered with bugs . She 's crazy , this girlfriend , sending us this filthy thing . " <p> John did n't recognize Helen 's voice , its high-pitched , cracking laughter . She 'd ordered feathers for him at Moon Lodge , and when she poked in the sack , " There 's a beak . A whole head . I crumple the bag shut and mail it the hell out of here . " Moon Lodge assumed she was bringing it home to be plucked that day , she said . " I puked and puked . I 'm sick talking about it . " She hung up . <p> Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airport . John found her at the baggage terminal , black denim pantsuit already showing the rise in her belly . She threw her arms around his neck . " I do n't know what to do , " she said . " Marry you , with all your little girls and their real estate ? " <p> " Oh yes , yes . " He nestled his face against her ear . " I mean no girls , no . You 're really here ! " He laughed , carrying her and the luggage to his truck . <p> " I 'll be a secretary . I 'll cocktail waitress in a frilly mini . Ranchers will scream and run . Will your dad let you divorce Millie ? " <p> " It 's not let me . ' He do n't have a say . " <p> " God , it 's beautiful here , " she said . " All the autumn leaf dust will make my sinuses explode . " <p> They contacted a Billings lawyer about the divorce . Helen would have to fly back for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle the lease , which was in her name . John announced the engagement at dinner , staring down each of his parents in turn . <p> " I think Berenice would kill me if she could , " Helen said . Later , undressing , she said , " Why ca n't I get out of my head the suspicion that I 'm marrying the slickest dick in the West ? " She looked at him searchingly . <p> " Wo-hoh . ' With a banshee laugh he tiptoed mincingly , cradling his privates . He kissed her belly , dancing her by the waist with his mouth still stuck to her . <p> " I 'm going to have one this time , " Helen said . She sat on the edge of the bed with shoulders rounded and hands clasped between her thighs so that her breasts spread comfortably and ungracefully against her belly . <p> John looked down at her body , aware in that moment of the body 's living for itself without caring about its effect on him . The realization made him feel shunned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the months and even days to come , he often would n't recognize himself . Life got bigger and bigger . He wondered if it was that way for everyone . <p> Aside from her coaching him through a midterm , they took days at a relaxed , spontaneous pace . Initially John complained about her tutoring style ; she asked questions but provided no answers beyond further questions . " But I understand it , " he said finally , thumping the textbook . " It makes sense . " <p> She tired easily , but her weariness was rosy and euphoric . " Maybe it 's the baby , " she said . " I do n't know , I never carried one this long . " He liked to drive one-handed , the other interlocked with hers over her belly . She indulged his tour of Billings malls . " Very modern , " she said . Preferring open spaces , she restored some of his pleasure in the land . <p> In search of wild horses he eased the truck through a mountain gap and up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Fifty yards below , the herd grazed along a verdant coulee . Their manes and tails were immensely long . John cut the engine and opened her door . <p> " Shetland ponies in hats scare me enough , thank you , " she said . He drew her by the hand . The animals shifted in unison like a drill team , first downhill , then , regrouping , toward them , led by a buckskin stallion . John descended the slope alone . " If you need this macho exercise to be good in bed , I do n't want to know about it . I 'm not looking , " she called , looking . The stallion broke into a run , hooves thudding , nearly upon John , who yelled , " Hah , " and waved his arm . The horse scrambled to a halt so abruptly he slid on his haunches . John pulled a clump of waist-high grass . The stallion knocked its legs together , skittering sideways . " Here , eat , " John said . The horse lips peeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , the animal retreated , munching . <p> John led Helen to the drop , the valley , buff and green , stretching into the haze . " Makes me greedy for quiet , " she said . He cupped her neck , and the hard breeze blew her hair against his hand , the first time he 'd seen it move ; watching her spray and sculpt her hair , and " put my face on ; " was a daily wonder . <p> When they reached the house , Teresa 's Scout was parked in the driveway . In the living room Teresa stood up , unkempt and jowly , to wait out the awkward formalities . " It 's taken me days to get up my nerve , " she addressed Helen . " I do n't know if I 'm telling you this in compassion or revenge . It 's the truth , take it or leave it . John lies . He 's still fucking me . Millie just had their third kid , for all he cares about it . He has kids by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know . And the coeds . Little candy-striper voices phone my apartment . Oh , is this Mrs. Sees the Hill ? ' And they hang up . <p> " I hit him with all this , and he does n't even bother to deny it . But you , you picture him waiting for you like a monk in his sweat lodge while you swell up with his baby . " Her lip perspired . Finished , she did n't know what to do , looking around as if expecting someone to invite her for dinner . <p> None of the family met Helen 's eyes . <p> " Sorry , " Teresa said . Backing out , she bumped the doorframe jarringly and clutched her shoulder . <p> " I knew it , " Helen said . She jerked her fist against the wall . " Who will drive me to the airport ? " Clayton went for his jacket . <p> John followed her down the hall . " She 's lying . " His voice rose . " Big fat Hulk bitch jealous to killing us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spread himself against the bedroom door . " It 's months and months , " he pleaded . " You 're here now . You 're always here . It 's okay " Helen opened the door and crouched for the luggage under the bed . " Please , " John cried . She did n't say a word to him , ever again . <p> When Clayton returned three hours later , John launched himself at his father . " You fuck her ? " he shouted . " You have a good time fucking her ? " Berenice threw herself between them . John called New York repeatedly , and they hung up . He left messages on the answering machine . Finally , weeks later , a roommate said , " She 's gone . She got an abortion , she had her tubes tied , and she went home " John asked for her number , and the woman hung up . <p> He was haunted by a Crow baby in a beaded cradleboard floating down a black river . The baby 's eyes were closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of herself and thrown him away , then closed herself against him forever . But worst was Helen hurting so badly . Her disappearance made her pain terribly large , as if it stretched from her apartment to whatever unknown place in Pennsylvania she had gone . He had torn something from the living Helen . Throughout his days she screamed to him . He felt his whole body as her scream . He had to shut his ears against himself . <p> The earth and the days became one long silence . He twiddled and fiddled through his time like an idiot . <p> Only one thought consoled him , imagining Helen giving birth to her niece , the bat girl . Helen stroked the girl 's long hair . The bats were ugly and funny . <p> Amusing Trina and Dan on one of their rare visits , he doodled with watercolors . Materializing on the stout , absorbent paper , in startling detail , was Winter Warrior-he knew the title instinctively-moccasined feet padding frozen turf , hunched slightly , an exaggerated curve to the neck . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He persisted as a distant , sinking shadow of Two Bears . <p> The Sun Dance <p> Short of breath and weak from self-starvation , Clayton went to a healer . " I 've got blood coming out both ends ; ' he said . Stripped , he lay beneath a buffalo robe , doubled up , aching . The healer pushed his knees down . Pale winter light flowed in the window . The healer sang continuously over the sick man , then knelt beside him . Growling in back of his throat , he placed his mouth on Clayton 's lower abdomen and sucked forcefully . Pain seared Clayton 's gut . Three times more the medicine man made a tube of his lips against Clayton 's skin . Rising , he spat out a stone half the diameter of his palm , a fire-red agate veined with green and blue . " Your son is lost , " he said . He opened the east door and threw the gem far into the snow . <p> Clayton walked home light and whole , with the absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little god , " the Arrow Creek community now reviled him as " the little devil . " <p> On leave of absence from school , John occupied the farthest corner of the Sees the Hills ' remaining land with a glamorous white woman of indeterminate age . Identifying herself as Crazy Horse 's great-granddaughter , she was reputedly an ex-call girl . She 'd established a tepee encampment , the Holy Confluence , to effect upon a wealthy clientele spiritual transformations through traditional Crow sweats and rituals led by Clayton , and feasts hunted by John . For select guests the woman herself conducted private sweats . <p> Rumor held that Clayton had sold medicine power to her . He 'd unwrapped his medicine bundle and temporarily purloined the Sun Dance doll for her viewing . <p> The mountain-man author was collaborating with him on a book about the Sun Dance , encouraged by a substantial advance . The crux would be the staging of a second Sun Dance , which Clayton had arranged to photograph . The mountain man was squeamish about this breach in tradition , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . This book is the Bible for our children 's children . Need to know how something 's supposed to be , look it up right there . " The occasion would be John 's grand prize at the Billings Art Fair , awarded for one of his gouache warriors . <p> With the family dancers starring in festivals from Washington , D.C. , to Alabama , Clayton drove a brand-new Bronco and was building a house for each of his three sons , even Martin , who lived with a busboy from the New York hotel where he 'd awakened from his spree . Since following Martin west , the man had taught him leatherwork and rudimentary silversmithing , and the two sold well at craft shows . Martin had not drunk alcohol in months . " Still my son , " Clayton said . " Put him in a dress , still my son " <p> John was n't unhappy with the spirit woman , who treated him graciously and had the body of a movie star . He missed Teresa and Millie . " I 'm too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for a chat . At two hundred thirty pounds , she 'd been christened " Mt . Hogan " by Martin . Millie 's boyfriend was so paranoid about John that he fired his .357 Magnum at pickups that merely resembled his . <p> During a late spring hunt Clayton and John stalked a deer halfway up a brushy canyon . Rifle cocked , John climbed toward a huckleberry thicket . Rustling froze him . Clayton crept alongside . Both raised their guns and held their breath . A rock cracked . <p> At that moment the sun broke through the clouds , bathing the hillside in the golden illumination of an ancient age . Into the shimmering the buck ambled unconcernedly , cropping the gilded grasses . Clayton fired , and the deer dropped to its haunches . With John 's shot the forelegs crumpled . The men plunged forward through slapping branches , hacking with the rifle butts . <p> Beyond the bushes they found no deer . The grass was not indented . No huckleberry twigs were broken . There were no blood spots , or hoof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John felt his eyes rolling like a terrified animal 's . His father poked under the brush . Together they scrambled back down the slope , heads swinging left and right . " Let 's go home , " John said . They stampeded out of the canyon . <p> All the drive home they scrutinized a filament of smoke that seemed to exactly mark their destination . Arriving , they found Berenice pacing beside a smoldering pit , what remained of the sweat lodge . " I 'm hanging laundry , and right in front of me , pop ! like the Fourth of July , and the whole thing 's burning up . I 'm screaming and yelling , but nobody else is around , " she said . " I get the hose , but it 's gone , just like that . A big ball of fire . " <p> " When did this happen ? " Clayton said . <p> " Maybe half hour . " <p> The men looked at each other . Clayton told her about the deer . " Same time , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , shuddering from head to foot . <p> " Do n't tell nobody about this , " Berenice said . <p> Clayton shook his head . " It happened . People will know . " <p> " Clayton 's lost his medicine : ' That much was agreed upon , and most awaited the impending Sun Dance with dread , certain calamity would fall on all their heads . The night Clayton led the procession into the Big Lodge , only twenty-eight went in , half of them white . Many more assembled outside on folding chairs and lounges . If divine retribution were to immolate the Sun Dance , nobody was willing to miss it . Disparagements were traded . <p> " Never seen that other Sun Dance chief . Where 'd Clayton get him ? " <p> " He looks like a teenager . Where 'd he get his medicine ? " " Clayton could n't get a real medicine man for this fake Sun Dance : ' <p> Singing and drumming urged worshippers toward the Center Pole , sacred pathway between heaven and earth . His ceremonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emperor . Under the moonlight John closed his eyes and saw a rain of warriors in the style of Shane Two Bears . For three days band after band leaped and gesticulated , twanged bows and arrows beneath galloping ponies , shook war clubs . Spotted , striped , and daubed , their afterimages crisscrossed in his mind . <p> For Clayton 's doctoring only two came forward , both white . A heart patient too ill to walk left the Big Lodge under his own power but relapsed the next day . The other , despondent over a divorce , claimed to feel better afterward . <p> Emerging from the Big Lodge on the last afternoon , Clayton faced a line of hills , a gray limestone escarpment that dully returned the sun 's light . Beneath the formation were interred hundreds of Crows who had died a century earlier , many wrapped against the winter cold in smallpox-infected blankets issued by the United States government . Others were lost in war against the Lakota and Cheyenne , or in their own feuds and disorders . Clayton stopped , overwhelmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years that sadness would be the one weight in his free flight of despair . <p> Beside him , John also gazed at the ridge 's cold glow . It caught at his heart to wonder how many of the warriors teeming in his head had fallen down there , sleeping . The much-feared catastrophe did not occur . Though shunned by the Crows , the Sees the Hills continued to prosper . The Sun Dance book sold moderately , John 's warriors briskly . As it had for centuries , the community endured . Many who had entered the Big Lodge were succored and uplifted by the hallowed ritual , even for the rest of their lives . <p>
