AMONG JAVA 'S MOST ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTERS IS a small but influential group of computer executives who see in the new programming language an almost visionary opportunity . With it , they believe , today 's increasingly powerful and complex desktop machines can be replaced with something far simpler and a good deal cheaper . <P> The idea is straightforward . Instead of buying bigger and bigger hard drives to store programs that seem to grow more monstrous with every upgrade , why not let the Internet be your hard drive ? The World Wide Web contains more data than you 'll ever use . Java , in theory , can retrieve all the software you need when you need it . All your computer really has to have is a fast processor , a good Internet connection and a few built-in programs to handle E-mail and word processing . If the price is right , predicts Larry Ellison , chairman of software giant Oracle and one of the idea 's chief promoters , " everyone will have one of these things . " <P> To test his theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to help design a " networked computer " to his specifications , with a keyboard , a processor , some random-access memory , a communications link and not much else . Meanwhile , nearly every other major computer maker , from Apple to IBM , claims to have something similar in the works . Sun has teamed up with Japan 's Fujitsu on a machine they are calling ( not surprisingly ) the " Java terminal . " <P> How much would one of these babies cost ? That depends on whom you ask . The price heard most often , from Ellison and others , is $500 . Sun is less optimistic ; company officials imagine their hot little Java boxes selling for somewhere between $500 and $1,000 . <P> At that price , it 's not clear what kind of market the new machines would attract . For $1,500 in post-Christmas sales , you can pick up a Windows or Macintosh computer that comes with loads of built-in software and hundreds of megabytes of storage , and that can also be hooked up to the net . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these computers can still do useful work . <P> To some old-timers , the idea of a stripped-down desktop machine harks back to the days of bulky mainframes , when all data and software were stored on big , centrally located computers and users had only " dumb " terminals on their desktops , with little or no memory or processing power . Today the operative paradigm is the so-called client-server model , where data may be stored on big file servers but the software runs on real , full-powered desktop computers . Over the years , the pendulum swings back and forth between the decentralized desktop and the centralized machine . In this instance , the idea of a $500 computer is not so new after all . <P> Still , the concept of a radically simpler Internet machine does have a certain seductive appeal . An inexpensive Volkscomputer could bring online millions of people who ca n't afford today 's PCs , offering them access and opportunities now beyond their reach . The stripped-down machines could also fit snugly into phone booths , airplane-seat backs and other public spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
