Section : VINTAGE He opened China . and more than a few bottles of the best Bordeaux . RICHARD NIXON looks back on a lifetime of toasts and tastings , summits and sommeliers , and remembers . <p> In inviting me to contribute to the inaugural issue of FYI , Bob Forbes assumed that I was a wine connoisseur . Like most politician , I am usually grateful for any accolades which come my way . But in this case I must admit that I do not deserve to be considered a connoisseur . My only qualification is that in 45 years of attending State dinners at home and abroad , I have been exposed to most of the best and some of the worst wines in the world . I have a well-deserved reputation for being controversial . My off-the-cuff observations on wines will , without a doubt , add to that reputation . <p> Let me begin by answering one of Bob 's questions : what makes a memorable wine ? Far more important than the type of wine , the reputation of the winemaker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the conversation about it . Do n't get me wrong . While the ritual is 90% nonsense , it is 100% fun . <p> In all of the great restaurants , the wine steward brings you the wine list . As he haughtily looks down his nose at you , you are careful to look down only the left side of the list for fear that he might conclude that you are concerned about the price . After your selection , he brings in the bottle and shows it to you . Once you nod , he carefully opens it , but does not serve it immediately because " you must allow time for it to breathe . " <p> This of course is a useless gesture because the air only reaches a few drops of the wine at the top of the bottle . If you want it to really breathe , you must ask that it be decanted , but that takes more time and adds substantially to the bill . <p> After it has breathed for a while , he pours a bit of it into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll it around in your mouth , look up at him , and nod your approval . I would guess , incidentally , that only one out of a hundred people ever sends a bottle back after tasting it . When you do send it back , you do so not because the wine is unpalatable , but because it is an effective way for you to impress your guests and the wine steward with your superior knowledge . <p> Why then go through this routine in a restaurant ? Because your guests will think the wine is top quality since it successfully ran this gauntlet . <p> Incidentally , a good rule for anyone serving wine at home is to talk it up . This makes for good conversation , and your guests will think it tastes better . <p> Turning to more serious subjects , my views on chilling and refrigerating a wine are generally conventional . A white wine should always be chilled ; a red never . After being opened , a white wine will keep for several days in the refrigerator . A red wine will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you should use it all at one sitting . <p> It is a mistake to assume that all wines improve with age . This is true of Bordeaux . The best Bordeaux should be aged for at least ten years . I was shocked recently on an airline when the stewardess served a 1987 Bordeaux from a world-famous vineyard . The year was great , out me wine was not ready to drink . White wines , in general , need no aging . In fact , if they are kept too long , they turn sour . <p> In the case of California wines , the years are virtually irrelevant since the climate and rainfall do not vary significantly from year to year . <p> Because it is generally known that I like Bordeaux , I have been served some of the best in the world . It is difficult to choose between Lafite-Rothschild , Mouton-Rothschild , Chteau Margaux , Haut-Brion , Latour , Palmer , Ptrus , and other first-growth Bordeaux . <p> I doubt if many would disagree with my selection of the best post-war years for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1959 , 1961 , 1966 , 1970 , and 1975 . I do not include some of the highly rated Bordeaux wines of the ' 80s , because they need more aging before they should be served . <p> My sentimental favorite among the Bordeaux is Chteau Margaux , in part because it was Disraeli 's favorite . I vividly recall a luncheon at Chequers , the British Prime Minister 's country residence , where I was seated next to the Queen . There were no printed menus , but I knew enough to recognize that the red wine which was served was outstanding . I discovered later that it was a 1947 Chteau Margaux , a great year , and a British favorite because they used to own the winery . For this occasion , they served , as I recall , just eight bottles to the 25 luncheon guests ; the Chequers wine steward had rejected six bottles as not being up to par . My guess is that those rejected bottles eventually ended up in the drain-pipes of the waiters rather than in the drains of the sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wines that I have served at home was from Baron Guy Rothschild , who was a luncheon guest at our home in Saddle River , N.J. After the 1960 election , a friend sent me three cases of Lafite-Rothschild 1961  --  generally rated as the greatest Bordeaux of the century . When the Baron tasted it , he immediately recognized it and told the assembled guests how lucky they were to have it served to them . He said that it was so rare that he did not even have any of it left in his own private cellar . <p> I have named some of the best years for Bordeaux . It is only fair to list some of the worst . Ironically , the poorest vintages for Bordeaux are American election years . The year 1968 is virtually undrinkable . If the wine steward tries to foist it off on you , file suit against the owner ! 1956 and 1960 are poor ; 1964 is the best of the election-year Bordeaux ; 1972 , 1976 and 1980 range from below average to moderately fair . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is best to leave the choice to the head chef or owner if you have the good fortune to meet him . For example , in the early 1960s , the late , legendary Henri Soul strongly recommended that I have a French white Burgundy rather than a German Moselle which I had selected . Sirio Maccioni at Le Cirque introduced me to Ladoucette , a moderately priced fum blanc from the Loire . Andr Soltner at Lutce proudly recommended a superb Tokay d'Alsace from his province in France . Girardet in Switzerland served excellent Swiss white wines when I visited his world-famous restaurant ( in Crissier ) . <p> My advice when traveling through Europe is probably unconventional . In the many splendid , small restaurants in France , Switzerland , Austria , Germany , and Italy , ask for the wine of the province . It is less expensive , it is seldom available in the United States because there is so little of it , and it is invariably excellent . <p> The most difficult question that the editor of FYI has posed is : what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my taste changes over the years . I used to put at the top of my list one of the finest wines in the world , Germany 's Bernkasteler Doctor . I often served it at the White House . But in later years , I found it a bit too sweet for my taste . Montrachet has a deserved reputation for being the best of the French white Burgundies . I find , however , that the qualities that make it great  --  richness and body  --  no longer appeal to me . My favorite pre-dinner wine is fum blanc from the Loire . It has the advantage of being less expensive and has a light distinctive aroma , which I find pleasing . <p> If I had only one wine to choose from in the balance of my life , it would be a Bordeaux . In fact , I have a half-a-dozen bottles of 1961 Lafite-Rothschild , and a case of 1959 Chteau Margaux , which I am saving for very special occasions . I also have a bottle of Lafite-Rothschild 1913 , the year I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I celebrate my 90th birthday . <p> I hesitate to suggest that some of the wines I have been served in my travels abroad have been below par . The Soviet Union , for example , is famous for its vodka but not for its wines . There is one exception . In 1972 , at a dinner in the Ukraine , we were served a claret which was comparable in quality with the best French Bordeaux . <p> In our trip to China in 1972 , Chou En-lai , who was a highly sophisticated world traveler , warned me that the watery-like , sweet red wine which was served in the Great Hall of the People was not worth drinking . That left me no choice except the 106 proof Moutai brandy , which Chou En-lai told me was the favorite drink for those who participated in the Long March and that " it could cure anything . " It was so potent that I doubt any germ could possibly have existed in it for more than a few seconds ! <p> On my last visit to China in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bordeaux-type wine which had been produced by a joint Chinese-French venture . The French justifiably have an international reputation for exquisite cuisine and excellent wines . There is no doubt in my mind that the Chinese , who also are known for their superb cuisine , will some day match the French in the quality of their wines . <p> Among the pleasant surprises I have found in my travels was a riesling , which was served in a small restaurant in Budapest in 1988 . I have never tasted one which was better and would hope that some day it could be made available in the U.S. market . <p> In selecting wines , most people have a tendency to look abroad for wines with famous names and as a result overlook excellent wines at home . California wines are now rated even by connoisseurs in Europe with the world 's best . New York and Washington produce good wines . A small New Jersey winery , King 's Road , produces a riesling which compares favorably with the best European rieslings . <p> There is more snob appeal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with famous names have been allowed to slip in quality and are overrated and overpriced . Just because it happens to be the most expensive wine on the wine list , does n't mean it is the best . If you have an honest wine steward  --  and there are some  --  tell him that you are not an expert and are not on an expense account and would appreciate his help . If he decides to take pity on you and give you an honest opinion , his advice will be worth more than the tip . <p> It will be noted that I have n't mentioned Champagne , which is without question the world 's most prestigious wine . I have been toasted with it , and have toasted others with it , hundreds of times . But I have n't drunk a glass of it in 37 years . I used to like it , but in 1953 President Eisenhower sent Mrs. Nixon and me on a goodwill trip around the world . For 69 days , at lunch and dinner , we were served Champagne . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taste of it . <p> I am often asked how our world leaders cope with the fine wines that are usually served to them . The answer is simple . Never mix alcohol with serious negotiations . Nikita Khrushchev had a reputation of being a boozer . But I recall that in a four-hour luncheon at his dacha near Moscow in 1959 , in which we continued the " kitchen debate " that we had had in public with no holds barred , he never took a sip from the wine and vodka glasses at each plate . I followed his example . <p> There is a famous anecdote involving Churchill and Stalin at one of the World War II conferences . Churchill wanted to have a completely private talk with Stalin and visited him at his villa with only Stalin 's translator present . Both men were pretty good drinkers , and both were night owls . They ate , drank , and talked until 2:00 a. m . The next day , Churchill awoke just before noon and said to himself , " My God , what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called in his secretary and dictated a three page , single-spaced letter in which he wrote , " Dear Marshal Stalin , I enjoyed our dinner and these are the issues I understand we discussed and what we agreed upon . " He had the letter hand-delivered to Stalin at Stalin 's dacha . Within a few minutes , Stalin 's reply returned . It was brief . It read , " Dear Prime Minister , do n't be concerned about what you said last night . I was drunk too . " And then there was a postscript , " And the translator has been shot . " <p> One final warning to those who enjoy fine wines . Sometimes when you 've had a couple of drinks you loosen your tongue and later believe that you have dazzled your audience with the brilliance of your conversation . When you reach this point , remember the counsel of , as I recall , Samuel Johnson 's wife : " Alcohol does not improve conversation . It only alters the mind so that you are pleased with any conversation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimental favorite among the chateaux , " in part because it was Disraeli 's .
