WELCOME TO MERRYWEATHER HIGH It is my first morning of high school . I have seven new notebooks , a skirt I hate , and a stomachache . The school bus wheezes to my corner . The door opens and I step up . I am the first pickup of the day . The driver pulls away from the curb while I stand in the aisle . Where to sit ? I 've never been a backseat wastecase . If I sit in the middle , a stranger could sit next to me . If I sit in the front , it will make me look like a little kid , but I figure it 's the best chance I have to make eye contact with one of my friends , if any of them have decided to talk to me yet . The bus picks up students in groups of four or five . As they walk down the aisle , people who were my middle-school lab partners or gym buddies glare at me . I close my eyes . This is what I 've been dreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only person sitting alone . The driver downshifts to drag us over the hills . The engine clanks , which makes the guys in the back holler something obscene . Someone is wearing too much cologne . I try to open my window , but the little latches wo n't move . A guy behind me unwraps his breakfast and shoots the wrapper at the back of my head . It bounces into my lapa Ho-Ho . We pass janitors painting over the sign in front of the high school . The school board has decided that " Merryweather HighHome of the Trojans " did n't send a strong abstinence message , so they have transformed us into the Blue Devils . Better the Devil you know than the Trojan you do n't , I guess . School colors will stay purple and gray . The board did n't want to spring for new uniforms . Older students are allowed to roam until the bell , but ninth-graders are herded into the auditorium . We fall into clans : Jocks , Country Clubbers , Idiot Savants , Cheerleaders , Human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hair Chix , the Marthas , Suffering Artists , Thespians , Goths , Shredders . I am clanless . I wasted the last weeks of August watching bad cartoons . I did n't go to the mall , the lake , or the pool , or answer the phone . I have entered high school with the wrong hair , the wrong clothes , the wrong attitude . And I do n't have anyone to sit with . I am Outcast . There is no point looking for my ex-friends . Our clan , the Plain Janes , has splintered and the pieces are being absorbed by rival factions . Nicole lounges with the Jocks , comparing scars from summer league sports . Ivy floats between the Suffering Artists on one side of the aisle and the Thespians on the other . She has enough personality to travel with two packs . Jessica has moved to Nevada . No real loss . She was mostly Ivy 's friend , anyway . The kids behind me laugh so loud I know they 're laughing about me . I ca n't help myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a bunch of kids wearing clothes that most definitely did not come from the EastSide Mall . Rachel Bruin , my ex-best friend . She stares at something above my left ear . Words climb up my throat . This was the girl who suffered through Brownies with me , who taught me how to swim , who understood about my parents , who did n't make fun of my bedroom . If there is anyone in the entire galaxy I am dying to tell what really happened , it 's Rachel . My throat burns . Her eyes meet mine for a second . " I hate you , " she mouths silently . She turns her back to me and laughs with her friends . I bite my lip . I am not going to think about it . It was ugly , but it 's over , and I 'm not going to think about it . My lip bleeds a little . It tastes like metal . I need to sit down . I stand in the center aisle of the auditorium , a wounded zebra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone , to sit next to . A predator approaches : gray jock buzz cut , whistle around a neck thicker than his head . Probably a social studies teacher , hired to coach a blood sport . Mr. Neck : " Sit . " I grab a seat . Another wounded zebra turns and smiles at me . She 's packing at least five grand worth of orthodontia , but has great shoes . " I 'm Heather from Ohio , " she says . " I 'm new here . Are you ? " I do n't have time to answer . The lights dim and the indoctrination begins . THE FIRST TEN LIES THEY TELL YOU IN HIGH SCHOOL 1 . We are here to help you . 2 . You will have enough time to get to your class before the bell rings. 3 . The dress code will be enforced . 4 . No smoking is allowed on school grounds . 5 . Our football team will win the championship this year . 6 . We expect more of you here . 7 . Guidance counselors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was created with your needs in mind . 9 . Your locker combination is private . 10 . These will be the years you look back on fondly . My first class is biology . I ca n't find it and get my first demerit for wandering the hall . It is 8:50 in the morning . Only 699 days and 7 class periods until graduation . OUR TEACHERS ARE THE BEST ... My English teacher has no face . She has uncombed stringy hair that droops on her shoulders . The hair is black from her part to her ears and then neon orange to the frizzy ends . I ca n't decide if she had pissed off her hairdresser or is morphing into a monarch butterfly . I call her Hairwoman . Hairwoman wastes twenty minutes taking attendance because she wo n't look at us . She keeps her head bent over her desk so the hair flops in front of her face . She spends the rest of class writing on the board and speaking to the flag about our required reading . She wants us to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read them . I write about how weird she is . We have journals in social studies , too . The school must have gotten a good price on journals . We are studying American history for the ninth time in nine years . Another review of map skills , one week of Native Americans , Christopher Columbus in time for Columbus Day , the Pilgrims in time for Thanksgiving . Every year they say we 're going to get right up to the present , but we always get stuck in the Industrial Revolution . We got to World War I in seventh gradewho knew there had been a war with the whole world ? We need more holidays to keep the social studies teachers on track . My social studies teacher is Mr. Neck , the same guy who growled at me to sit down in the auditorium . He remembers me fondly . " I got my eye on you . Front row . " Nice seeing you again , too . I bet he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder . Vietnam or Iraqone of those TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lock sticks a little , but I open it . I dive into the stream of fourth-period lunch students and swim down the hall to the cafeteria . I know enough not to bring lunch on the first day of high school . There is no way of telling what the acceptable fashion will be . Brown bagshumble testament to suburbia , or terminal geek gear ? Insulated lunch bagship way to save the planet , or sign of an overinvolved mother ? Buying is the only solution . And it gives me time to scan the cafeteria for a friendly face or an inconspicuous corner . The hot lunch is turkey with reconstituted dried mashed potatoes and gravy , a damp green vegetable , and a cookie . I 'm not sure how to order anything else , so I just slide my tray along and let the lunch drones fill it . This eight-foot senior in front of me somehow gets three cheeseburgers , French fries , and two Ho-Hos without saying a word . Some sort of Morse code with his eyes , maybe . Must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cafeteria . I see a few friendspeople I used to think were my friendsbut they look away . Think fast , think fast . There 's that new girl , Heather , reading by the window . I could sit across from her . Or I could crawl behind a trash can . Or maybe I could dump my lunch straight into the trash and keep moving right on out the door . The Basketball Pole waves to a table of friends . Of course . The basketball team . They all swear at hima bizarre greeting practiced by athletic boys with zits . He smiles and throws a Ho-Ho . I try to scoot around him . Thwap ! A lump of potatoes and gravy hits me square in the center of my chest . All conversation stops as the entire lunchroom gawks , my face burning into their retinas . I will be forever known as " that girl who got nailed by potatoes the first day . " The Basketball Pole apologizes and says something else , but four hundred people explode in laughter and I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the door . I motor so fast out of the lunchroom the track coach would draft me for varsity if he were around . But no , Mr. Neck has cafeteria duty . And Mr. Neck has no use for girls who can run the one hundred in under ten seconds , unless they 're willing to do it while holding on to a football . Mr. Neck : " We meet again . " Me : Would he listen to " I need to go home and change , " or " Did you see what that bozo did " ? Not a chance . I keep my mouth shut . Mr. Neck : " Where do you think you 're going ? " Me : It is easier not to say anything . Shut your trap , button your lip , can it . All that crap you hear on TV about communication and expressing feelings is a lie . Nobody really wants to hear what you have to say . Mr. Neck makes a note in his book . " I knew you were trouble the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-four years and I can tell what 's going on in a kid 's head just by looking in their eyes . No more warnings . You just earned a demerit for wandering the halls without a pass . " SANCTUARY Art follows lunch , like dream follows nightmare . The classroom is at the far end of the building and has long , south-facing windows . The sun does n't shine much in Syracuse , so the art room is designed to get every bit of light it can . It is dusty in a clean-dirt kind of way . The floor is layered with dry splotches of paint , the walls plastered with sketches of tormented teenagers and fat puppies , the shelves crowded with clay pots . A radio plays my favorite station . Mr. Freeman is ugly . Big old grasshopper body , like a stilt-walking circus guy . Nose like a credit card sunk between his eyes . But he smiles at us as we file into class . He is hunched over a spinning pot , his hands muddy red . " Welcome to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . " Welcome to Art . " I sit at a table close to his desk . Ivy is in this class . She sits by the door . I keep staring at her , trying to make her look at me . That happens in moviespeople can feel it when other people stare at them and they just have to turn around and say something . Either Ivy has a great force field , or my laser vision is n't very strong . She wo n't look back at me . I wish I could sit with her . She knows art . Mr. Freeman turns off the wheel and grabs a piece of chalk without washing his hands . " SOUL , " he writes on the board . The clay streaks the word like dried blood . " This is where you can find your soul , if you dare . Where you can touch that part of you that you 've never dared look at before . Do not come here and ask me to show you how to draw a face . Ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneak a peek behind me . The eyebrow telegraph is flashing fast . This guy is weird . He must see it , he must know what we are thinking . He keeps on talking . He says we will graduate knowing how to read and write because we 'll spend a million hours learning how to read and write . ( I could argue that point . ) Mr. Freeman : " Why not spend that time on art : painting , sculpting , charcoal , pastel , oils ? Are words or numbers more important than images ? Who decided this ? Does algebra move you to tears ? " ( Hands raise , thinking he wants answers. / " Can the plural possessive express the feelings in your heart ? If you do n't learn art now , you will never learn to breathe ! ! ! " There is more . For someone who questions the value of words , he sure uses a lot of them . I tune out for a while and come back when he holds up a huge globe that is missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me what this is ? " he asks . " A globe ? " ventures a voice in the back . Mr. Freeman rolls his eyes . " Was it an expensive sculpture that some kid dropped and he had to pay for it out of his own money or they did n't let him graduate ? " asks another . Mr. Freeman sighs . " No imagination . What are you , thirteen ? Fourteen ? You 've already let them beat your creativity out of you ! This is an old globe I used to let my daughters kick around my studio when it was too wet to play outside . One day Jenny put her foot right through Texas , and the United States crumbled into the sea . And voilan idea ! This broken ball could be used to express such powerful visionsyou could paint a picture of it with people fleeing from the hole , with a wet-muzzled dog chewing Alaskathe opportunities are endless . It 's almost too much , but you are important enough to give it to . " Huh ? " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globe . " He walks around the room so we can pull red scraps from the center of the earth . " On the paper you will find one word , the name of an object . I hope you like it . You will spend the rest of the year learning how to turn that object into a piece of art . You will sculpt it . You will sketch it , papier-mch it , carve it . If the computer teacher is talking to me this year , you can use the lab for computer-aided designs . But there 's a catchby the end of the year , you must figure out how to make your object say something , express an emotion , speak to every person who looks at it . " Some people groan . My stomach flutters . Can he really let us do this ? It sounds like too much fun . He stops at my table . I plunge my hand into the bottom of the globe and fish out my paper . " Tree . " Tree ? It 's too easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade . I reach in for another piece of paper . Mr. Freeman shakes his head . " Ah-ah-ah , " he says . " You just chose your destiny , you ca n't change that . " He pulls a bucket of clay from under the pottery wheel , breaks off fist-sized balls , and tosses one to each of us . Then he turns up the radio and laughs . " Welcome to the journey . "
