0380806215The Assassins of Tamurin Chapter One The people of my village cast me out when I was eleven . Or at least I believed I was eleven , for neither I nor anyone in Riversong knew the day or place of my birth , much less who brought me into the world . It happened because of three sewing needles , the shiny steel kind you can buy in any town marketplace . I was supposed to take them to the priestess at the Bee Goddess 's shrine , half a morning 's walk from the village , so she could have her turn to sew for her family . Foster Mother would n't have sent me if anybody else had been available , but as it happened I was the only one she could spare . Annoyed at this , my aunt Tamzu said , " It 's an insult to the priestess to send this wretched child to her , but I suppose there 's no help for it . " Not to be outdone , Aunt Adumar added , " And , Lale , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthless girl ! When you talk to her , keep your eyes on the ground . Do n't gawp at her like a dead moonfish , and do n't scratch and spit and pick your nose . " " I 'll be very respectful , Auntie Adumar , " I said . I was careful to sound glum , because if I appeared happy about my errand , she 'd find some way to take it away from me . Actually , I was delighted to be going , because the priestess lived near a bee cave some three miles from Riversong , and I 'd have a whole half day free of my interminable chores . So I quickly pulled my raggedy brown cloak over my smock , and Foster Mother gave me the scrap of leather with the three needles pushed through it and told me to go . Aunt Adumar aimed a swat at my bottom as I went out the door , but I dodged it . Young though I was , I was acutely aware of how precious the needles were . I clutched them tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything until I stood in front of the priestess . Then , full of this resolve , I tramped through the village , past the fish-smoking racks and the breadnut plantation , until I came to the path that led into the forest . The wet season was n't far off , and a steady , lukewarm drizzle began to fall as I passed into the green gloom beneath the leaves . Around me , enormous gum trees rose from thickets of fern and brush and soared toward a gray and stone-smooth sky . I must have looked very small among those gigantic trunks , trudging along the path as the drizzle darkened my long auburn hair to a deep reddish brown . I was a lean-limbed , lanky little creature in those days , slender of foot and slim of hand , with green eyes under thick lashes . But I did n't look exactly like the villagers , although their eye and hair color resembled mine . My complexion was pale and creamy , like the dust that powdered the forest paths in summer , while theirs was darker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed I had northern blood , which accounted for my deceitful tongue . I did n't know if northerners really were deceitful , because I had never met one , but Adumar was right about the tongue . Out of necessity , I had become an accomplished liar almost as soon as I could talk . All went well until I reached the ford at Hatch Creek , which was n't far from the Bee Goddess 's shrine . But there I discovered that the rain had turned the ford to a rushing torrent , and I knew the pebbly bottom would be treacherous . If the current tumbled me into deeper water and I had to swim for the bank , I might well let go of the needles . Fearing this disaster , I used the biggest of the three to pin the leather to the thin fabric of my smock , under my cloak . But despite my apprehension , I managed the ford without difficulty and went on toward the shrine . By now the rain had stopped , and although my stomach was growling , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure the needles were safe . Whatever the reason , I 'd walked some considerable distance before I again felt inside my cloak for the scrap of leather . It was n't there . Both it and the priceless needles had vanished . At first I was only a little frightened , because I knew exactly where I 'd been . Retracing my steps toward Hatch Creek , I scanned every bit of the sodden path . I knew I could n't miss seeing the leather , because my footprints in the thin mud showed exactly where I 'd walked . And it could n't have blown into the undergrowth beneath the trees , because there was very little wind . But the leather was nowhere to be found , and my heart began to thud with apprehension . By the time I reached the creek , with no sign of the needles , I was on the edge of panic . Fighting tears , I stopped on the bank and examined my smock again . Broken threads showed where I 'd pinned the leather holder , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my cloak . But I had n't found anything on the path , so where had it gone ? Into Hatch Creek . The needles had fallen into the water when I was crossing , and the rushing stream had carried them away . My stomach turned over . I had to find them , I had to . My village was so poor and so far from any real marketplace that its women had to share the same set of needles , and they 'd only had these for two months . Moreover , they 'd had to collect every coin they possessed to buy the things from the peddler , who was the only one we 'd seen in almost a year ...
