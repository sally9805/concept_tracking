Ideal water conditions on the prairies have given duck numbers a big jump . Headnote Dust off the calls and shellbags ; the ducks are back . Here are ten places to find ' em near you . // " HUNTERS WOULD CALL ME last year , " says Arkansas Waterfowl Biologist Tim Moser , " and the 'd ask , ' Where are the ducks ? ' I 'd tell them , ' Teal and gadwalls are way up , ' and they 'd say , ' Yeah , yeah , we 're shooting lots of those , but where are the ducks ? " To Arkansas hunters , real ducks have green heads ; everthing else is just a " scrap duck . " Not every hunter across the country draws such a hard line , but the mallard remains our most sought-after duck and the mainstay of the pulle duck harvest from New York to California . Well , this year , the ducks are back . Breeding mallard numbers , which actually declined slightly between 1995 and 1996 , shot up from 7.9 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third full year of ideal water conditions on the prairies , " says Lloyd Jones of Delta Waterfowl Foundation in North Dakota . " Mallards have been on the increase , and a building population has the potential to make these big jumps upward . " Not only are the prairies wet , but the Conservation Reserve Program ( CRP ) has idled millions of acres of vital upland nesting cover in the pothole region . One more wet year and the greenheads might break their all-time record of 11 million birds , set in 1958 . Meanwhile , the total duck harvest this fall could surpass last year 's 13.8 million ducks . Just seven years ago at the end of the Dusty Eighties , by comparison , the nation 's total bag was only 6.2 million . Overall , breeding duck numbers this spring stood at 42.5 million , the highest figure since surveys began in 1955 . Based on those numbers , the Fish and Wildlife Service ( FWS ) predicts a healthy fall flight of 92 million ducks . And mallards are n't the only good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " duck " for many hunters , pintails showed their first increase in almost fifteen years , from 2.75 million to 3.5 million birds . That 's a giant step in the right direction , but still well below historic levels . Teal : We have over 6 million bluewings and nearly 3 million greenwings , far above long-term averages . Most bluewings will be relaxing in Mexico when you read this , but look for plenty of fast , sporty greenwings over the decoys this fall . Redheads : There are almost 1 million redheads , well above their North American Waterfowl Management Plan ( NAWMP , the FWS blueprint for waterfowl conservation ) goals . Gadwalls : Called " Squareheads " in North Dakota and " gray ducks " in Louisiana , gadwalls increased by nearly 1 million birds this year , from 3 million to almost 4 million . Widgeon : Their numbers still lag well below historic levels , but this year the widgeon population jumped an encouraging half million birds up to 3 million . Shovelers : The colorful " smiling mallards " continue to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year , there 's always reason for pessimism in the world of waterfowl . A 92 million duck fall flight definitely beats the 60 million bird flights of the 1980s , but the NAWMP called for fall flights of 100 million birds in an average year . We 've got 92 million with the best water conditions in history . Moreover , certain species are n't recovering , despite ideal conditions . Black ducks : This traditional northeastern favorite continues to decline as mallards pioneer eastward , hybridizing with and displacing blacks . Canvasbacks : Cans are slightly down this year , though they remain above NAWMP goals . " You hear about the clouds of canvasbacks hunters saw even as recently as the 1930s , " says Delta 's Jones , " and you wonder if we are n't setting the target number way too low . " Sea ducks : Very little research is done on sea ducks , but many biologists are concerned about both king eiders and oldsquaw . Scaup : Scaup surveys have n't shown the expected population increases despite excellent conditions on their tundra/muskeg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe scaup may be fooling the duck counters by nesting to the east , outside the duck survey areas . Habitat : " We 've been very lucky to have CRP in the U.S. , " says Jones , " Canada has no similar program and a lot of the Canadian prairie is becoming a moonscape with water . " TEN PLACES TO GO TIES YEAR Two years of strange weather patterns-1995 's early , storm-driven " Grand Passage , " followed by last year 's wishy-washy " Pineapple Express " - proved conclusively that no matter how many ducks there are , they wo n't necessarily appear over your decoys with their wings cupped this fall . Wind and weather rarely distribute the prairie duck bounty evenly across the country . So , if the weather cooperates , if the stars align , if the Chicago Cubs win the World Series . . . . Here , in no particular order , are ten places where we absolutely guarantee you 'll see ducks this fall . North Dakota : North Dakota is the freelance waterfowler 's mecca ; hunters can legally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dakota in October are the ultimate destination for a wandering hunter with a bag of decoys and a pair of chest waders .

Texas/Louisiana Coast With gadwalls and teal at record numbers and pintails rebounding , the coast should be covered up with ducks this winter . There are guided rice field hunts for ducks and geese at Eagle Lake , west of Houston , and around Lake Charles , Louisiana .

Niobrara/Missouri River , Nebraska : The Missouri River has been dammed into a series of reservoirs running all the way from the Montana border to Nebraska . The water stays open late into the season on Lewis and Clark Lake near Yankton , South Dakota , holding mallards who find plenty to eat in the cornfields nearby . South Dakota 's limited nonresident licenses sell out early , so hunt the Santee Indian Reservation on the south side of the river or launch a boat in Nebraska and hunt the Missouri or the Niobrara from mid-November through December .
