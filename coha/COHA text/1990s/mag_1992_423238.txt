<p> The summer months are synonymous with activities like bass and walleye fishing , or trips to Lake Ontario to troll for salmon . Fishing any of the trout streams is the furthest thing from the minds of most outdoorsmen . <p> Most of us do our trout fishing in April and May . The water is often high and cold at this time of the year , but the trout are usually hungry after being inactive over the winter months . When summer comes , the water warms up and the fish become harder to catch . Summertime trout fishing is difficult but not impossible . The added difficulties only serve to make it a more interesting challenge . <p> A trout stream is much warmer and clearer during the summer months than it is during the spring . Peak periods of fish activities coincide with major insect hatches , which usually take place during the early morning and late evening hours . Fishing at noontime under a hot summer sun is often a waste of time . Trips to the stream should be planned with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish after work and stay on the stream until it is nearly dark . I often find that the best fishing comes in that last hour of daylight . <p> The clear water makes it much easier for trout to see a fisherman approaching . Therefore it is very important during the summer not to clash with the color of the streamside vegetation . Wear colors that blend in , and avoid bright colors that stand out against the surroundings . Some people even go so far as to wear camouflage shirts or fishing vests . <p> The way you approach a trout stream in the summer is very important to your success . The best way to fish is to start downstream and work your way upstream . Try to keep near one of the hanks so that the brush will break up your outline . Do n't let the fish see you or your shadow . It does n't take much to spook trout during summer stream conditions . <p> Casting accuracy is more important during summer trout fishing . In the spring you are casting to areas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be casting to individual fish that you have located by sight . If you are using spinning gear , cast a little upstream of the fish to give the lure or bait time to sink . Flycasters should keep their false casts to a minimum , and well away from the fish 's view . <p> Ultra-light fishing gear really performs during summer . in the spring , when the water is high and murky , you can get away with 10-pound test line . Under summer stream conditions any line heavier than four-pound test will be seen by the fish . You 'll get even more strikes with line under four-pound test , hut this calls for a reel with a smooth drag system that is easily adjustable . <p> Fly fishermen should also use light tackle . Fly rods that are capable of handling lines under a six-weight will be ideal for summer fishing . Some of the really light systems , those capable of handling a fly rod rated two or three weight , are great for the delicate presentations that you will need during the summer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On windy days they are not very easy to cast . <p> Lures and flies that you should use in the summer are quite a bit smaller than those used in the spring . Spinfishermen would use size " O " spinners , tiny spoons or small-sized plugs . One can also get a casting bubble , which is basically a clear bobber filled halfway with water for use in casting trout flies . This system allows one to fish with dry flies and nymphs without a fly rod . <p> Flyfishing is the best bet for catching summertime trout . There are often insect hatches in the evenings that trout feed on exclusively . <p> The trick is to figure out what the fish are hitting and match it with a dry fly . <p> Sometimes , in summer fishing , you can get lucky and hit a time when the trout are hitting nearly anything . I was on the Upper Hudson River in Warren County on last July 4th . My dad and I decided that we would go fishing before we had a picnic . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first spot we tried so we moved upstream a couple of miles . <p> I was flyfishing and my dad was using spinning gear . We ended up catching some really nice rainbows that were aggressively hitting the dry flies I was fishing with , as well as the small Mepps spinners my dad uses . <p> At other times trout , especially browns , get so particular about what they want to eat that they refuse nearly anything else . I can remember fishing on the Esopus Creek in Ulster County a few years ago . My friend and I tried everything that we had in our fly boxes and caught nothing , while dozens of fish were rising to insects . Finally my friend tried a tiny size 22 Adams and immediately started to catch fish . Unfortunately , I did n't have anything that small with me . <p> Without going into a long discourse on the insects that hatch in the summer , let me mention several flies worth having . Bluewinged Olives are a good summer fly as are Pale Evening Duns , Tricos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summer fishermen should have some very small sizes of these dry flies . Number 22 and 24 flies will produce quite a few fish on occasion . The difficulty lies in tying the leader onto the fly . <p> There are some shortcuts in figuring out what hatches the trout are hitting on . if you know a local angler with experience on that stream , ask him , or her , what flies will work and when you should use them . There are also hotline numbers that give the types of insects hatching on some of the top trout fishing streams like the Esopus or the Battenkill . <p> Another way to get some information on what flies to use is to visit one of the local tackle shops that is near the stream that you want to fish . Most of these shops are owned by people who love to fish and are willing to help other people out . Buy a few files , even if you do n't need them . Do n't just pick the proprietor 's brain and walk away . <p> Once I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of what the fish are hitting , I often experiment with more than one fly at the same time . If I know that the trout on a certain stream are hitting Blue-winged Olives and Pale Evening Duns , I tie a Pale Evening Dun to the leader and then tie an Olive on a short dropper . By doing this I can see what the fish prefer . Cut off the fly that they are not hitting and add another of the one they are hitting , thus doubling your chances of catching fish . <p> Another technique that I use when fishing with very tiny dry flies during the summer is to use a strike indicator on the leader . These are usually made of a fluorescent foam tape that . sticks on the leader . it makes it a lot easier to keep track of where the fly is on the water , and wo n't spook the fish . <p> When fishing with spinning gear , you should remember that the fish are not going to chase a lure that comes ripping past them . Slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lure in the pocket water around boulders and logs that are stuck in the stream . Fish in these areas have less time to look over their food and will be more susceptible to spinners and spoons . <p> Fishing for trout during the hot summer months is a different ballgame than spring fishing . It is a little more difficult than spring fishing , but it is n't impossible . One advantage of this sort of fishing is that you will often have a stream to yourself . The crowds tend to thin out during hot summer weather . <p> So do n't hang up your trout fishing gear when summer starts , there is still plenty of good fishing in July and August . <p> Photo : Rainbow Springs Club by Lanford Monroe ( COURTESY SPORTSMEN 'S EDGE GALLERIES , NEW YORK ) <p> Photo : Some good late summer flies : ( Left to right ) Olive Elk Hair Caddis , Tan Elk Hair Caddis , Pale Evening Dun , Trico spinner , Blue-winged Olive and Adams ( R.
