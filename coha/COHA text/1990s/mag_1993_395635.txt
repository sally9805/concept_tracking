The statistics are alarming . In three out of four of the leading causes of death among Africa-American women , obesity is the major risk factor , and , according to one 1992 study , nearly 50 percent of us are obese . We all know how critical it is to be as fit as we can be . But for many of us , getting  --  and staying  --  in good shape is an uphill struggle . Even for those of us who religiously try to eat the right stuff and have a regular exercise regimen in place , it 's all too easy to be overwhelmed by the information overload  --  diet fads here today and discredited tomorrow , and miracle machines that promise to work wonders for our thighs , money back guaranteed . So we went to the experts and asked them for the state-of-the-art research on exercise and weight control  --  solid information that can help us achieve our personal physical best . EXERCISE I know that working out with weights will tone and strengthen my muscles , but will it really make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training is more than a vanity sport . Many studies have found that pumping iron a minimum of two times a week helps counter two phenomena that come with age : the natural loss of bone mass , which can lead to osteoporosis , and muscle shrinkage , which , when severe , can weaken the body and make everyday tasks difficult . And that 's not all . A new study conducted at the University of Maryland also suggests that weight training can help lower the risk of two ailments prevalent among Black women : diabetes and heart disease . " With training , more sugar from the blood gets into the muscle tissue where it can be metabolized properly , " explains researcher Ben Hurley , Ph.D. , director of the exercise-science labs at the University of Maryland . " This does n't reverse diabetes , but our research shows that it can help the blood-sugar regulation of people in a prediabetic state return to normal . " Because blood-sugar impairment can also increase the risk of heart disease , Hurley believes weight training reduces this risk factor as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reap the rewards of aerobic exercise ? And how long should my workouts be , particularly if I want to burn fat ? Casually ambling down a country road , as opposed to a long brisk walk or run , wo n't improve your fitness level  --  fitness involving how efficiently your lungs fuel your muscles with oxygen , how strong you are and how long you can exercise before getting tired . On the other hand , you do n't have to exercise at a frantic pace to improve your health . It 's true that the fitter you are , the lower the risk of disease . But the health benefits actually seem to taper off when you burn more than 2,000 calories a week . Exhausting workouts wo n't necessarily make you any healthier . When John Duncan , Ph . D. , associate director of the Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas , compared people who walked at a speed of 5 miles per hour to those who walked 4 and 3 mph , he found that they all equally lowered their risk of coronary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laval University in Quebec , showed that long , moderate-intensity workouts decrease the risk of diabetes as well as increase HDL ( high-density lipoproteins ) levels , the " good " cholesterol carriers that help protect against arterial disease that may lead to heart attacks . These workouts are difficult enough to make you break into a sweat and breathe harder , but not so hard that you ca n't talk to someone as you go . " The study also shows that even if you do n't lose body fat by exercising , you can still lower the risk of disease . " says Jean-Pierre Despres , Ph.D. , the university 's associate director of the lipid-research center . And what if you do want to lose body fat ? In Duncan 's study , the women who walked for 60 minutes at 3 mph , rather than those who walked for 36 minutes at 5 mph ( both covered 3 miles ) , burned the most fat . That suggests , says Duncan , that the key to fat burning is a long-lasting , nonstop workout of moderate intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into its fat stores for fuel until after about 45 minutes , so that the longer you go at it the more beneficial your workout . For busy people who can barely squeeze in 10 minutes on the treadmill , let alone 45 , all is not lost . For one thing , any amount of aerobic exercise you do will burn calories and burning calories will help you lose weight . Can I be heavy and still be fit ? Absolutely , just as surely as you can be skinny and unfit . Even if you do n't lose a pound , moderate exercise can help normalize blood sugar and reduce blood pressure . And you do n't have to get fanatical to get fitter : " The important thing is to do something , " says Pat Lyons , R.N. , M.A. , a regional health-education consultant at Kaiser Permanente , northern California . " People think that you have to be at your target heart rate three times a week or it does n't do any good . In fact , research indicates that the greatest health benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being somewhat active , " says Lyons , who is coauthor of Great Shape : The First Fitness Guide for Large Women ( Bull Publishing , Palo Alto , California , 1990 ) . Lyons suggests starting slowly by building more activity into your lifestyle . " You do n't have to put on special clothes and go someplace to work up a great deal of sweat , " she says . Do something you enjoy  --  walking with a friend after lunch , dancing around the house or gardening . There are exercise programs tailor-made for large people ( inquire at your local YWCA or YMCA ) . Water-aerobics classes are effective and safe , because the sport is a nonimpact activity . Whatever activity you choose , says Lyons , go at a pace that 's comfortable for you : " If you 're getting winded , it 's too fast . Do n't listen to anybody who drives you to do more . " I 've never been heavy . But as I get older , I 've noticed my body getting droopy and lumpy in certain areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Working out with weights and doing calisthenic exercises can help you combat the body 's natural surrender to gravity . Unfortunately , there 's no such thing as spot reducing . The body generally burns fat all over , so the best way to attack lumps is to get involved in an aerobic fat-burning routine . Getting rid of that stomach paunch is not as difficult as it seems . " Fat in the abdomen is more metabolically active than fat in the hips and thighs , so the body will preferentially mobilize and burn it first , " says Despres of Quebec 's Laval University . Pay closer attention to your posture . Sit-ups and other exercises that tighten and strengthen the abdominal muscles also help . I know that exercise is really important for general fitness , but in what specific ways can it help me lose weight that dieting ca n't ? Recently researchers at the United States Department of Agriculture 's Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University reported that excess body fat is largely due to inactivity , not excessive eating . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aerobic workout will probably increase your metabolic rate ( the rate at which you burn calories ) for up to 36 hours postexercise . Moreover , by building muscle through aerobic exercise , you will increase your resting metabolic rate 24 hours a day , because the more muscle you have , the more calories your body must expend to maintain it . It 's for this reason that even strength training has some weight-loss perks . While repetitions of " flys , " " bench presses " and other body building routines wo n't burn nearly as many calories as say , riding a bike , swimming , stair climbing or jogging , they develop more metabolism-raising muscle than aerobic activities . The latest research from Hurley of the University of Maryland also suggests that , just like aerobics , weight training may cause a rise in person 's resting metabolic rate ( RMR ) . HEALTHY EATING Do genes play a role in determining my size ? Heredity has a major influence on everything from your body weight and shape to your predisposition to heart disease and diabetes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hefty squares a day  --  plus desserts and snacks  --  and not gain weight , while others have to struggle to keep pounds off . We all vary in our RMR , which is the number of calories we use for basic functions like breathing . If you have a lower RMR , it 's easier for you to gain weight . Your RMR is inherited , but it is also affected by environmental factors . For example , if more of your weight is made up of muscle and less is fat , your RMR will be higher . This is one reason why exercise and strength training  --  and not merely watching what you eat  --  are so crucial to long-term weight control . Genes also influence how much of your weight is stored in the upper portion of your body and how much in the lower portion . For unknown reasons , the tendency to store fat in the upper body , which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease , is more prevalent among Black women than it is among white women . But genes do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tendency . " Predisposition is not definite , " says Shiriki K. Kumanyika , Ph.D. , M.P.H. , associate professor and associate director for epidemiology at the Center for Biostatistics and Epidemiology at Pennsylvania State University . " The susceptibility is there , but it does n't have to be expressed . " Being genetically predisposed to obesity means only that it 's important for you to avoid the risk factors for being overweight  --  a high-fat diet and a sedentary lifestyle . I know I need to exercise , but what kinds of foods do I need to eat for maximum health and fitness ? The basics of a good diet are high fiber and low fat . That , combined with moderate levels of activity , can lead to weight control , improved energy and reduced risk of heart disease and cancer . Avoid making a drastic overnight overhaul of your eating patterns ; it could backfire . Experts also warn against getting obsessive about what you do and do not eat . A more reasonable  --  and lasting  --  approach to eating right is to aim for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more plant foods in it than animal foods , " says Maudene Nelson , R.D. , a nutritionist and certified diabetic educator ( C. D. E. ) with the Institute of Human Nutrition at Columbia University . " When you look at your plate , you should see grains , like rice or whole-grain bread , vegetables , maybe a potato , " she says . " There 's no problem with a small piece of meat once a day , " says Nelson . Meat is a problem when you eat several big portions a day Focus on fiber : fruit ; vegetables , such as broccoli , kale and collards ; whole grain foods such as wheat bread ; and oatmeal and beans . The average American gets only about half the recommended 30 grams of fiber per day , a shortfall due to eating too much processed food , according to Nelson . Fruits and veggies are also high in nutrients like vitamin C and beta-carotene , which may have anticancer benefits . I understand that I have to cut down on fat to lose weight . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by far the worst in terms of raising total cholesterol . Although eating polyunsaturated fats is better for you than consuming saturated fats , eating large quantities of the polyunsaturates has been associated with certain cancers . Switching from unsaturated to polyunsaturated fats brings mixed blessings : It lowers both good and bad cholesterol . Monounsaturates  --  such as olive and canola oils  --  are best of all : If you use monounsaturated fats , you will lower your bad cholesterol without reducing your good cholesterol . " We should emphasize monounsaturated fats , deemphasize polyunsaturates and take saturated fats out of our diet , " says Columbia 's Maudene Nelson . But keep in mind that holding down total fat intake is the most important thing . Monitoring fat intake in your diet will get easier when the Food and Drug Administration 's ( FDA ) new labeling regulations come into effect a year from now . The new labels will list a food 's cholesterol and fiber contents , its amount of saturated fat and the number of calories derived from fat . Until then , here 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have five or fewer grams of fat per ounce . * Avoid major fat sources like butter and whole-milk dairy products , deep-fried food , baked goods with hydrogenated fats and highly saturated tropical oils and high-fat cuts of meat and poultry . * Trim fat from meat , and remove the skin from chicken . * Substitute olive oil or canola oil for vegetable oil or shortening in cooking . * You can make healthier baked goods using egg whites only , canola oil instead of butter , low-fat milk and yogurt and nonfat sweetened condensed milk .
