<p> Der Spiegel : Mr. Mailer , more frequently than ever before you complain about the social and cultural decline of America . Has this development turned you into a pessimist ? <p> Norman Mailer : If we have a serious depression , then I do n't see what 's going to hold the country together . I 'm very gloomy that way . The animosity between blacks and whites ( would ) become exacerbated . Probably there would be riots in the ghettos . I can foresee a situation where there might be internment camps and restriction of civil liberties . <p> DS : Is America really , as you recently predicted , moving into " the first real stages of fascism " ? <p> NM : It could indeed happen , but I do n't see fascism in our case as coming with brown uniforms . We will be in a totalitarian situation long before we 're a fascist country . A fascist mentality could develop , though . But we 've not reached that point yet . <p> If we bungle through economically for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a scenario . But I am fearful of a depression because it ( means ) evil forces are threatening . <p> DS : In your book " The Armies of the Night , " you noted in 1968 : " America , once a beauty of uncomparable magic , now a beauty with a face of a leper . " Has this leprosy disfigured the body of America even further ? <p> NM : No question , the illness has spread further . If I had to do it over again , I might not use that word leprosy because it has such intense connotations to people that they avoid thinking about the real problem . <p> There was a spiritual leprosy present in the war in Vietnam , because we went from being a centrally good and attractive nation with all the complexities obviously put to the side , into a country that had become ugly in spirit . <p> I once wrote about Vietnam that " the war would encourage every horror to rise from its sewer , " and exactly that did occur . We did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was even remotely like what we have had since . But Vietnam is just part of the pain America has inflicted upon herself . <p> DS : If these dimensions are as dramatic as you claim , it is even harder to understand why the intellectuals of America are not already manning the barricades . <p> NM : I think everyone is too apathetic . We live in a situation that is terribly confusing . No one really knows anymore who the enemy is , where the enemy is , do we have an enemy ? Do we really identify ourselves with this society ? <p> DS : Is n't that one more reason for the writers to deal with these topical problems ? <p> NM : Our intellectuals are worn out . There is no fire out there any longer . That is one of the reasons why I think we are heading toward fascism . <p> Who will block the way ? Forget the writers  --  novelists are not primarily intellectuals . And those who are have been worn out by all the internecine fights about communism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is , after all , the critic of the American establishment ? <p> DS : Who , if not the intellectuals , the writers , journalists and Hollywood directors , can take note of the injustices of the society , write them down and oppose them ? <p> NM : Our problems are so extensive that at the end you have one result : apathy . Nobody knows the solution anymore . Intellectual confusion is apparent . <p> What can we do ? We have always suffered as a nation from self-righteousness , self-pity and huge hypocrisy , and it seems to me these tendencies have gotten worse from day to day . We do have good writers who are complaining all the time . . . . <p> DS : . . . Only no one listens to their voices ? <p> NM : Because politically engaged writers like Heinrich Boll in Germany or Jean-Paul Sartre in France were never very much in fashion in America . America has never been a country for such writers concerned about social issues . Those writers who were , were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really incapable of affecting matters politically , and Faulkner , who was probably a conservative , had no interest in it . <p> I can only speculate why we do n't produce good writers who are politically active . One of the reasons may be that it does tend to get in the way of writing a good novel , because if you are too angry about something , that is no way to write a book . A good book is written through irony , not through rage . <p> DS : Possibly American novelists are unwilling to touch controversial but socially relevant subjects because they know that these books do n't create wealth or fame . They have developed into opportunists . <p> NM : You can make that accusation . You might be right . It is just too hard for me to judge it . I am one of them , an American writer , and I am in the middle of it . I can only assert from my own experience that it is harder and harder to say who the real enemy is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be predictable ; in a few decades novelists will be insignificant  --  accepted by society , spoiled , but without any influence . <p> NM : In 30 or 40 years we will have arrived at this situation . If you want to write serious novels in the future , you will be doing it because that 's what you really want to do , but you will have no illusions that you can make your living doing it . You will teach at a university or you will marry a wealthy woman or whatever the writer will do to be able to afford the luxury of writing . They will not make their living from their books . <p> DS : What will the American culture develop into with these symptoms ? <p> NM : Into a hideous culture of television  --  that state we did reach already , and the result is visible : If you lived with a goat all the time and this goat just " baa-ed " in your face all the time , all the time , all the time , after a while you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a goat as well . <p> DS : America  --  a nation of sheep ? <p> NM : Well , goat , sheep , whatever word you want to use . It 's a dull beast . Yes , yes , America is less attractive than it used to be . The people are getting flattened out . <p> DS : But if Norman Mailer , who for many years has been the symbol of liberal intellectualism , now publicly claims that the liberal ideology is " as attractive as motel furniture , " what remains of the hope that other liberal intellectuals do n't start to think the same way ? <p> NM : One point I would like to clarify right away : I have never been a liberal . I have been on the left , yes  --  for 30 years now I have been a left conservative . I do n't draw hope from liberals , but , as odd as it seems , from another source : the end of the Cold War . Because the end of the Cold War is going to introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because American capitalism has lost a wonderful old friend . <p> DS : The empire of evil ? <p> NM : Precisely . The war against " the evil empire " kept us together a little more closely than our natural bent or inclination , and now , now that this pressure from outside is no longer there , we are on our own and there are going to be growing disagreements . <p> Now we have to solve the problems of capitalism , because capitalism has gone away as far from Adam Smith as communism went from Karl Marx . <p> DS : If you look back on your life , which traumatic experiences would you rather not live through again : the time of senseless consumption of whiskey and drugs , which gave you the delusion of being a genius , as you once wrote , or the drama with your second wife , whom you stabbed and injured badly ? <p> NM : You are talking to a man who is considered a felon  --  that at least is how the law sees it . The episode with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that of my children . You do n't stab your wife without paying for it in a variety of ways . In recent years the business with Jack Abbott ( a prisoner whose writing Mailer championed , who after his release murdered a waiter and was re-imprisoned ) gave me no joy , to put it mildly . <p> Yes , you mentioned alcohol . The drinking wrecked my health to a certain extent , and I had some horrible times . Nevertheless , I would probably react the same way , as far as my drinking is concerned . <p> DS : Through your six marriages as well ? <p> NM : Even with my second wife , upon whom I inflicted so much pain , I am in touch . We have two daughters together . Why should I want to erase this reality ? My wives have shared parts of my life . To forget this existence together , to attempt to suppress it would mean nothing less than to try to extinguish an essential part of my life . Let 's just leave it here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the relationships with women I would have to write a book . <p> DS : Are you afraid of getting older ? <p> NM : No . It was n't always a wonderful life , but I ca n't complain . I tend to feel more and more over the years that self-pity is the great vice , that I would rather someone be ugly and stingy and mean than be full of self-pity . <p> I demand less of life , so I probably enjoy it a little more . <p> DS : Are you flattered by the characterization " a Jewish Hemingway , " or does the comparison with your colleague bother you ? <p> NM : Neither . I do n't think I 'm as good a writer as Hemingway , but in this time of my life I do n't have to prove to myself or others my value . I have become a celebrity , and as such I make the headlines again and again  --  without really doing anything . That 's how the star system works . Once you belong to the so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news to someone . <p> DS : Do you regret that you never moved through Africa , as Hemingway did , or lived in an intellectually challenging environment such as Paris with James Joyce , Pablo Picasso , F. Scott Fitzgerald and , last but not least , Marlene Dietrich ? <p> NM : No . I have always found America so complex and fascinating that if I had moved somewhere else I would have been in misery , because things would be happening in America and I would n't know what they were . <p> DS : Was the suicide of Hemingway in ' 61 a gesture you understood ? NM : His suicide is another long shadow in my life . A real shadow . He did none of us writers any good by committing suicide . He took something away from us because we believed in Hemingway , his vitality , wisdom and strength . <p> I did not know Hemingway well . For a long time I clung to the lies that ( the death ) had been an accident . <p> DS : In your newest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characters says , " I am beginning to think the world is filled with geniuses , but only a few survive . " For you , who are the geniuses ? <p> NM : Fidel Castro , Charles de Gaulle and  --  Muhammad Ali , the champion of the world . He is a genius as well  --  not only in boxing . <p> DS : Why he ? <p> NM : Because he is such a charismatic personality  --  a hero in a world that always fascinated me : boxing . <p> DS : When was the last time you stepped into the ring ? <p> About eight years ago . Because of a bad knee I could not jog anymore ; arthritis bothered me . <p> I miss boxing , but I am a realist about it . Only with great comprehension of my opponents could I leave the ring undamaged . <p> DS : What fascinates you about this sport ? <p> NM : The barrage of gloves reminds me a little bit of an artillery bombardment or the dangers of car racing . If you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a kind of " high , " if you know what I mean . <p> DS : Is Picasso for you one of these geniuses , or why do you write about him now , 18 years after his death ? <p> NM : Oh , he 's a genius , no question . Thirty years ago I was going to do a book about him and I got sidetracked . That book has stayed in my mind . Somehow I 've been fascinated by Picasso . <p> I happened to come across some of my old notes of 30 years ago and I could have written them yesterday , so one part of my life remained consistent . <p> DS : Do you feel a certain kinship toward Picasso , because he has been a man of the left , even a member of the French Communist Party ? <p> NM : He was n't even a serious Communist , you know ; it was a role he played . He loved working on his legend . He painted his own legend . He kept changing it like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any very close personal friends among writers  --  Arthur Miller , for example ? <p> NM : No , not Arthur Miller . We do n't think of each other as very simpatico . " <p> I believe it 's almost impossible . Among actresses , two beauties can not necessarily become great friends . I mean , could Marlene Dietrich and Elizabeth Taylor have become dear friends ? Rather doubtful . <p> I respect men like Bill Kennedy , ( William ) Styron , Gore Vidal , ( John ) Updike , ( Kurt ) Vonnegut , ( Saul ) Bellow . But my closest friends are not writers . <p> DS : Mentally , at least , you shared a woman with Miller : Marilyn Monroe . You wrote a book about the beauty ; he married her . <p> NM : To share a woman mentally is not to share her . I have no illusions about that . <p> DS : What was fascinating for you about Marilyn , who really did not make headlines as an intellectual ? <p> NM : Everybody saw her as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delicate comic sense , and she was fabulously beautiful but not at all in an elegant way . She was beautiful sexually . Just a simple , sweet sexuality came off her  --  and at the same time she had such subtle little airs . In one sentence : I was fascinated with her . <p> DS : " The prime responsibility of a woman is to be on Earth long enough to find the best mate for herself and conceive children who will improve the species , " you wrote in your " Prisoner of Sex . " You certainly did put your philosophy into reality  --  nine children with six wives . But the image of being a " sexist " has haunted you ever since . <p> NM : If you are married as often as I was there is a high likelihood that you are going to have a lot of children . It has nothing to do with a philosophy . <p> The quote you are confronting me with has been pulled out of context by the feminists , who , by the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being when it comes to pulling things out of context . <p> DS : You despise feminists , do n't you ? <p> NM : The feminists are not equipped to begin to understand . They do n't read me , so how would they judge my thoughts ? <p> They put me on indexes in colleges . There are feminists teaching in colleges who really would not like their students to read me . <p> DS : On top of it all , are you really proud of it ? <p> NM : It 's no honor at all . I want to be read . <p> DS : When you were 25 the critics praised your book " The Naked and the Dead " as the " greatest war novel of the century . " Has that instant stardom become a kind of burden for you ever after because your next eight novels were immediately compared with the first , the great one ? <p> NM : Well , it may have been a burden back then , but by now , no . After a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the condition of my life . I was Norman Mailer , the well-known novelist , so there was no need to go looking for a new identity . I was indeed Norman Mailer and I learned to live with him . <p> DS : You once revealed one life ambition : to write a novel that Dostoyevsky , Marx , Joyce , Freud , Stendhal , Tolstoy , Proust , Spengler and Hemingway might all have wanted to read . When do you want to realize that dream ? <p> NM : " Harlot 's Ghost " is the first half of it . We 'll see how I will succeed with the second part . <p> The question today is not anymore whether I will write the one , the great book . The question is : Who is interested ? Norman Mailer or someone else is not the subject . Now the whole idea is just to keep literature from perishing . <p> I do hope that I 'll be dead wrong , but I am afraid my prediction will prove right : The future for authors @ @ @
