A leader 's step-by-step guide to envisioning the future - and communicating it to others . // You feel a strong desire to go on a challenging expedition to a place you 've never been . It 's a desire that you ca n't shake , something that you think about day and night . At first , your desire for challenge is quite vague ; you do n't have a specific destination in mind . But soon you feel a need to decide on the kind of challenging journey that you want for yourself . You look at some alternatives : trekking through the mountains , sailing an ocean , hiking across a desert , going on a safari . Whether through conscious thought or unfocused meditation , you discover what appeals to you the most : You decide , for example , that you 've always wanted to take a trek through the Himalayas . So what do you do now ? More than likely , you consult a travel guide , study maps , look at photographs . You talk to people who have climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it before . You begin to get a real sense of the place-the weather , the dress , the customs , the food , the travel conditionsall those impressions that clarify your understanding of your destination . Not wanting your trip to be just like others you 've heard about , you decide that you 'll make this something special . You decide that your expedition will be unique , one that no one else has ever undertaken-perhaps even one that National Geographic would want to cover . Then you set a date many months or even years in the future . You know such arduous journeys are n't done alone , so you determine who else might share your desire for challenge and how those people would benefit from the experience . You recruit some colleagues , selling them on the benefits of high adventure . Then the planning begins in earnest . Discovering a vision for your organization is similar in many ways to these initial stages of preparing for an expedition . You feel a strong inner sense of dissatisfaction with the way things are in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong belief that things do n't have to be this way . Envisioning the future begins with a vague desire to do something that would challenge yourself and others . Because you want what you create to be unique , you differentiate your organization or cause from others that produce the same product , provide the same service , or make the same promise . Yours is a distinctive vision , an ideal . Visions for organizations or reformations or movements , as well as visions for journeys , are more complex than this , of course . And we do n't necessarily follow such a sequential process for clarifying our visions-especially if we 're attempting to achieve what no one has ever achieved before . Four Attributes of Vision Let 's take a closer look at four attributes of vision , which we define as an ideal and unique image of the future . 1 . Ideality : The Pursuit of Excellence Visions are about possibilities , about desired futures . They 're ideals , standards of excellence . As such , they 're expressions of optimism and hope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to considering possibilities , not simply probabilities . Indeed , it is exactly this belief that sustains teacher Nolan Dishongh and helps him spark possibility thinking in students otherwise at risk . Many of the 14- to 16year-olds in Dishongh 's construction trades class at Alice Johnson Junior High , 25 miles east of Houston , have well-earned reputations as troublemakers , as students with short attention spans , low grades , and little interest in learning . Many are from broken or abusive homes ; some are known gang members . Dishongh sets the tone at the start of each school year by asking his students to lay their heads on their desks . Then , in his deep , soothing voice , he instructs them to think about their mother , about her holding them close as infants , feeding them and singing to them . He asks them to try to remember how that felt . He says , " She loves you , no matter what , but what makes her happy is being proud of you . I believe each and every one of you wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do . And that 's what we 're doing here . It 's not about grades . It 's about your mother being proud . " The youths quickly realize that this is n't a " normal " classroom and Dishongh is n't a " normal " teacher . He cares . He believes his students can become people to be proud of-not at risk but full of possibilities . Most success stories , like Nolan Dishongh 's , are about possibilities . They are about improving upon the existing situation or creating an entirely new state of existence . Many leaders are dissatisfied with the status quo and believe that something better is attainable . Their leadership experiences are examples of possibility thinking . They represent the choice of an ideal . Ideals reveal our higher-order value preferences . They represent our ultimate economic , technological , political , social , and aesthetic priorities . The ideals of world peace , freedom , justice , a comfortable life , happiness , self-respect , and the like are among the ultimate strivings of our existence-the ones that we seek to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idealized purpose that we hope all our practical actions will enable us to attain . 2 . Uniqueness : Pride in Being Different Visions communicate what makes us singular and unequaled ; they set us apart from everyone else . Visions must differentiate us from others if we 're to attract and retain employees , volunteers , customers , clients , donors , or investors . There 's no advantage in working for , buying from , or investing in an organization that does exactly the same thing as the one across the street or down the hall . Only when people understand how we 're truly distinctive , how we stand out in the crowd , will they want to sign up with us . Photograph // One of the best ways you can discover that uniqueness in your organization 's vision is to begin by asking why your customers , internal or external , would want to buy your particular service or product , attend your program , or listen to your sermon . One of our favorite answers to that question was this simple yet eloquent statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flower shops : " We do n't sell flowers , we sell beauty . " While customers of a florist do exchange money for a dozen roses , what they 're really buying is something more than that : They want to beautify their homes , or express their love for others , or brighten the day . It does n't take vision to sell a flower on a street corner , but it does take vision to sell beauty . 3 . Future Orientation : Looking Forward Photograph // Constituents want their leaders to be " forward-looking , " to have " a long-term vision or direction . " Leaders need to be proactive in thinking about the future , and this imperative increases with one 's scope and level of responsibility . Visions are statements of destination , of the ends of our labor ; they are therefore future-oriented and are made real over different spans of time . It may take three years from the time we decide to climb a mountain until we actually reach the summit . It may take two to three years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a decade to build a company , a century to grow a forest , and generations to set a people free . For leaders of a community who envision neighborhoods so safe from crime that little children might once again walk alone to the corner store , aspirations may take a lifetime to achieve . The point is that leaders must occupy themselves with thinking about the future and become able to project themselves ahead in time . The result of their thinking ahead is what we call a " vision . " 4 . Imagery : Pictures of the Future Leaders often talk about future issues in terms of foresight , focus , forecasts , future scenarios , points of view , and perspectives . These are all visual references . Try this experiment : Think about Paris . What immediately comes to mind ? Most people think of the Eiffel Tower , the Arc de Triomphe , the Seine , Notre Dame , good food , wine , romance . These are images of real places and real sensations . You probably do not think of square kilometers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Numbers are n't what first comes to mind . Why ? We recall the images of reality , not abstractions from reality . To envision the future we must be able to draw upon that very natural mental process of creating images . When we invent the future , we need to get a mental picture of what things will be like long before we begin the journey Images are our windows on the world of tomorrow . When talking about going places we 've never been-whether to the top of an unclimbed mountain or to the pinnacle of an entirely new industry-we imagine what they 'd look like . We picture the possibilities . Visions are conceptualizations . They become real as leaders express those images in concrete terms to their constituents . Just as architects make drawings and engineers build models , leaders find ways of giving expression to their hopes for the future . Applying Vision to the Future The most important role of visions in organizational life is to give focus to human energy . Visions are like lenses that focus unrefracted rays of light . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's ahead of them , leaders must have and convey a focus . Imagine watching a slide show when the projector is out of focus . How would you feel if you had to watch blurred , vague , and indistinct images for an entire presentation ? We 've experimented with this in some of our leadership programs . The reaction is predictable . People express frustration , impatience , confusion , anger , even nausea . They avoid the situation by looking away . When we ask them whose responsibility it is to focus the projector , the vote is unanimous : " The leader-the person with the focus button . " The leader 's job is to keep the projector focused . No matter how much involvement other people have in shaping the vision , we expect that the leader will be able to articulate it . To use another metaphor , it 's easier to put a jigsaw puzzle together if you can see the picture on the box cover . The leader 's job is to paint the big picture , to convey the vision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like when everyone has put the pieces in place . A vision is a mental picture of what tomorrow will look like . It expresses our highest standards and values . It sets us apart and makes us feel special . It spans years of time and keeps us focused on the future . And if it 's to be attractive to more than an insignificant few , it must appeal to all of those who have a stake in it . Whether you 're leading a small department of 15 , a large organization of 15,000 , or a community of 150,000 , your vision sets the agenda and gives direction and purpose to the enterprise . As a leader , you must create a vision for your organization-one based on ideal and unique images of a common future . Eight Actions for Finding And Focusing Your Vision The following are some practical action-steps for developing your vision and preparing to move with it into the future . 1 . Think First about Your Past Leaders with the longest time horizons are those who understand their past . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant past events of your life . A useful " lifeline " exercise was developed by Herb Shepard and Jack Hawley , authors of Life Planning : Personal and Organizational ( National Training and Development Service Press , 1974 ) . Here 's an abbreviated version : Draw your lifeline as a graph , with the peaks representing the highs in your life and the valleys representing the lows . Start as far back as you can remember and stop at the present time . Next to each peak , write a word or two identifying the peak experience . Do the same for the valleys . Now go back and think about each peak , making a few notes on why each was a high point for you . Analyze your notes . What themes and patterns are revealed by the peaks in your life ? What important personal strengths are revealed ? What do these themes and patterns tell you about what you 're likely to find personally compelling in the future ? You can also apply the process to your organization . By looking over the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaknesses . You can then become better informed about the foundation on which you 're building the organizational future . 2 . Determine What You Want Are you in your job to do something , or are you in your job for something to do ? If your answer is " to do something , " take out a sheet of paper and at the top write , " What I want to accomplish . " Now make a list of all the things that you want to achieve on the job . For each item , ask yourself , " Why do I want this ? " Keep on asking why until you run out of reasons . By doing this exercise , you 're likely to discover those few higher-order values that are the idealized ends for which you strive . Now ask : How would I like to change the world for myself and my organization ? If I could invent the future , what future would I invent for myself and my organization ? What mission in life absolutely obsesses me ? What 's my dream about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my organization ( department , plant , project , company , agency , congregation , community ) ? What 's my burning passion ? What work do I find absorbing , involving , enthralling ? What will happen in 10 years if I remain absorbed , involved , and enthralled in that work ? What does my ideal organization look like ? What 's my personal agenda ? What do I want to prove ? 3 . Write an Article about How You 've Made a Difference Your responses to the questions just posed should give you some clues to what you would like to accomplish in your life ( and why ) . Now take it a step further . Imagine that it 's the year 2005 and you 've been selected to receive an award as one of the 50 people who have made a difference in this century . Imagine that a national magazine has put together an article about the difference that you 've made to your organization , family , or community . Write that article . Do n't censor yourself . Allow yourself this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the process somewhat embarrassing . The more comfortable you are in discussing your innermost wishes , the easier it will become to communicate a vision to others . In writing your article , ask yourself the following questions : What am I most proud of ? What 's my greatest contribution to my community 's or organization 's growth ? Photograph // Then , once you 've answered these and similar questions , project your answers into the future . Writing such an article-and then reading it to your colleagues-is a very powerful way to clarify what 's truly important to you . By looking back over your life and its potential , you come face to face with the legacy you want to leave . Your article should bring that legacy into clearer focus . 4 . Write a Short Vision Statement Take all the information you 've just gathered and write your ideal and unique image of the future for yourself and for your organization . This statement should be short-you ought to be able to tell it to others in about five to seven minutes . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . Once you 've written it , try drawing it , finding a picture that resembles it , or creating a symbol that represents it . Finally , create a short slogan of five to nine words that captures the essence of your vision . Edward Goeppner 's " We do n't sell flowers , we sell beauty " is a good example . A brief slogan is very useful in communication . It 's not a substitute for a complete statement , but it does help others to remember the essential reason for the organization 's existence . 5 . Act on Your Intuition Visions often take a while to take shape in the mind . We need even longer before we can formulate them into articulate statements . Instead of struggling with words on paper , do something to act on your intuition . Do as Don Bennett did when he acted immediately on his inspiration to start the Amputee Soccer League . If you 're inspired to do something , go try it . Go kick the ball around . Then you 'll see whether you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll also see whether others are as enthusiastic about the idea as you are . Visions , like objects in the distance , get clearer and clearer as we move toward them . Talk to people . Share your thoughts with others . 6 . Test Your Assumptions Our assumptions are mental screens that expand or constrain what 's possible . To determine their validity in regard to your vision , take the following steps : Make a list of the assumptions underlying your vision . Flesh out each assumption : Ask yourself what you assume to be true or untrue about your constituents and your organization , about science and technology , about economics and politics , about the future itself . Ask a few close advisers to react to your assumptions . Do they agree or disagree with you ? Why or why not ? Ask people who you think might have different assumptions to respond to yours . Test your assumptions by trying an experiment or two . Don Bennett assumed that amputees could do more than they might think-like play soccer-so he tested his assumption by kicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world cup of amputee soccer each year . 7 . Become a Futurist Ask yourself what 's driving your organization 's agenda ( or that of your congregation , community , department , or agency ) . Is it your own view of the future or someone else 's perspective ( such as the competition 's ) ? Does the organization have a clear and shared understanding of how the field or industry will be different 10 years from now ? Set up a futures-research committee in your organization to study developing issues and potential changes in areas affecting your business . A few years ago , the American Life Insurance Council established the Trend Analysis Program . A team of more than 100 people began continually tracking more than 60 publications that represent new thoughts on trends in American society , then abstracting the articles . A smaller team then pulled the abstracts into reports for use in planning and decision making . You could adapt this methodology , or a similar one , to your setting . Have all the people in your organization regularly clip articles from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Circulate the ideas generated by this tracking and discuss trends and impacts on your product , service , technology , department , agency , company , and/or community . Use these discussions to help you and your organization develop the ability to think long term . 8 . Rehearse Your Vision Once you 've clarified your vision , one of the most effective things you can do to help you realize it is mental rehearsal-the act of mentally practicing a skill , sequence of skills , or attitude using visual imagery or kinesthetic feelings . Mental rehearsal is used extensively in sports training to improve athletic performance . By visualizing yourself doing a move perfectly or reaching a desired goal , you increase your chances of making imagination become reality . Don Bennett told us that he imagined himself on the top of Mount Rainier a thousand times a day before his climb . Adapt this technique to your situation : Imagine what it will be like when you and your organization attain your vision . Rehearse this scenario over and over again . Another practical technique is affirmation-a positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of making firm that which you imagine for the future . An affirmation , sometimes called positive self-talk , can be made in writing , made silently , or spoken aloud . Whatever the mode , it 's most effective in the present tense , as if the desired state already existed . Write several affirmations about the ideal and unique image of your organization . Phrase your affirmation positively in terms of what you want . Make it short , and repeat it over and over to yourself . The Compass and the Dream These techniques should help you focus your vision and create positive expectations about the future . These techniques , and others like them , are n't substitutes for personal conviction and a vision of substance , but they 're extremely useful in keeping you focused on what you want to create . The more positive you feel about the future you envision , the better able you 'll be to communicate positively with others . Even armed with techniques , though , leaders find that there 's no freeway to the future , no paved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or signposts . Instead , the explorer must rely upon a compass and a dream . The vision of an organization acts as its magnetic north . It possesses the extraordinary ability to attract human energy . It invites and draws others to it by the force of its own appeal .
