Midway between the lair of the Bengal tigers and the stamping ground of the African elephants at the San Francisco Zoo is an attraction more commonly seen along city sidewalks : a parking meter . But drop a quarter in and you get a lot more than 30 minutes of parking time . When a donor turns the handle of the modified meter , a mechanical red-throated hummingbird flies across a jungle scene , signaling that the donation will be used to save a small plot of tropical rain forest . <P> The Conservation Meter was the brainchild of zookeeper Norman Gershenz , who came up with the notion while feeding the koalas one day . " It creates a link between the wild and what 's going on in the city zoos , " he says , and it offers zoogoers the opportunity to " do something immediately " for endangered habitats . <P> A vividly hued sign on the meter offers a sense of the impact of the coins , which go to La Amistad National Park in Costa Rica .

The message seems to make a deep impression on budding environmentalists . " It 's really neat , " says Lily Lubin , 9 , who persuaded her parents to part with some change . " It feels like every time I put a quarter in , I 'm saving an animal 's life . " <P> A second conservation meter has popped up at the National Aquarium in Baltimore , and zoos and aquariums in more than 20 other cities , including Seattle and Philadelphia , have requested the machines , which were developed with financial backing from the Virginia-based Nature Conservancy . If each of the 1 million annual visitors to the San Francisco Zoo gave 25 cents , the $250,000 could purchase more than 800 hectares of rain forest . Nationwide , more than 120 million annual zoo visitors could save 100,000 hectares a year . Impressive though that sounds , it will take many more quarters to reverse the fate of the rain forests , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
