<p> All those headlines about tourists being mugged and murdered in Florida are making Vincent Allegrini , 74 , a retiree from suburban Chicago , a bit nervous about his upcoming vacation there . <p> Yes , he 'll be more careful . But no , they wo n't stop him from going . <p> Nor will they stop Lynn Jackson , a 34-year-old working woman from Houston , who heads for the Sunshine State next month . She 's accustomed to living in a big city , always aware of crime - but thinks it a sad day that the USA is being viewed worldwide as a dangerous place to visit . <p> " I would expect this to happen in the Middle East , " she says . " But in the United States ? ! " <p> Allegrini is " afraid of what I 'm going to find , really . " <p> Their reactions , say travel industry watchers , are fairly typical of what happens when a vacation area suddenly experiences a wave of violence : People who 've already booked still go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere - at least for awhile . <p> " Already , you 're seeing people drifting to ultrasafe destinations , " says John Stachnik of Mayflower Tours in Downers Grove , Ill . <p> " We 've been taking literally thousands to Branson , Mo . - homespun Americana , middle of the country , away from the strife . They want to get away from the danger zones . " <p> The danger zone , in this case , is Miami . The latest incident : a German tourist robbed , then brutally murdered in front of her kids last weekend - the sixth foreign visitor killed in Florida since December . <p> Reaction was swift . " Miami : Death Trap Under the Palm Trees , " screamed a German tabloid . " State of Terror , " shouted a British one . <p> Florida , where tourism is a $ 29 billion a year industry , got jittery : <p> Rental car companies have replaced " Y " or " Z " tags on about 29,500 cars out of 599,500 in their fleets . The rental tags identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form has been formed . <p> Police stepped up vigilance . <p> Is that enough ? Travel psychologist Charles Rotman of Babson College in Wellesley , Mass. , thinks not : " Assurances or disclaimers of an isolated event from police , hotels , other agencies and chambers of commerce - especially if death or injury has previously happened - hold little credibility , especially if the predators have not been caught . " <p> " When an individual 's survival has been threatened or terminated within a tourist attraction or geographical area - a person will identify with this type of violence and internalize that it ' could happen to me ' . " <p> Never mind that the latest victim - or , for that matter , all the others this year - was a foreigner , a stranger in a strange land . She did what anyone would when her rental car was rammed : She got out to look . This time , it was a fatal mistake . <p> Are such incidents , though isolated , inevitable ? <p> Probably , says John Noble of Northwestern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are or how many precautions a tourist destination adds , these things can happen . You get lost . You make wrong turns . But by using common sense and good judgment , you can reduce the chances . " <p> Though plainly concerned , Merrett Stierheim of the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau is optimistic . " I guarantee you , after all the ink , I do n't think there 's going to be very many people who are n't sensitive to the dangers , " he says . <p> At least he hopes so . For Florida , another incident could be catastrophic . About 1 in 6 of the 40 million visitors to Florida are from abroad . In Miami , it 's even higher - almost 1 in 2 . Among Germans , drawn by a strong deutschmark , arrivals jumped 22% last year and 39% the year before to 400,000 annually . <p> Florida simply can not afford much more bad publicity , says Phil Davidoff , former president of the American Society of Travel Agents . <p> " Really , Miami is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see the Germans looking at Florida the way our clients today are looking at Egypt . I personally believe that a client would be safe ( in Egypt ) . But there are just enough headlines and problems to scare off a lot . And I understand their point fully . So we recommend other areas . " <p> For a case study of what could happen , look no further than Los Angeles , a city where international tourism is just now beginning to recover from the devastating effects of last spring 's riots . <p> Japanese and Koreans are still not coming back at previous rates and , according to calculations from Gary Sherwin of the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau , the city has lost $ 600 million in tourist dollars since the violence that grabbed worldwide headlines . <p> In the wake of those riots , the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration polled foreign arrivals to see how important safety was in choosing a vacation destination . <p> Most nationalities said it was very important - 98% of Venezuelans , for example ; 77% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other countries ( 72% of Germans , for example ) while Asians were more cautious ( only 48% of Japanese thought it was as safe or safer than other countries ) . <p> From afar , Florida , for the most part , has not been viewed as a particularly violent place . <p> " People just do n't expect this , " says tourism official Gary Stogner . " This is a state of sunshine . And beaches . And Walt Disney World . <p> " But the reality is that we are a very fast growing state with major metropolitan areas . We have the same problems that other metro areas face . Regrettably , criminals come here for the same reason . " <p> Adds security expert Jerry Hoffman of ASI International : " Normally , the crime has n't impacted on the tourist areas . In Washington , D.C. , for instance , the crime problem is away from ( tourists ) . But what we see now , in Florida , is it 's happening in ( those ) areas . And people are n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're on the verge of seeing a little different trend . " <p> For Jackson , the Houston woman headed to Orlando , the trend is sad : " It 's a sorry state that we 're having to live in this much fear . " <p> Allegrini agrees . But he 's more philosophical . " These are dangerous times we 're living in . But the key word there is living . You can barricade yourself in the house , " he shrugs , " but that 's not living . " <p> He leaves in 12 days . Destination : Miami . <p> How to stay safe on the road Travel experts offer these safety tips : <p> Do n't stop if someone says there 's something wrong with your car ; go to a service station or well-lit area and call for help . <p> Do n't stop to help someone in need of assistance ; dial 911 from the nearest phone . <p> Do n't pull over for flashing headlights ; police have red or blue lights . <p> Get clear directions before you head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study your map or directions , or go to a service station or well-lit public area .
