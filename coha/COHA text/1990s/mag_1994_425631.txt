<p> Torres del Paine , probably the most famous national park in South America , is experiencing a tourist boom . Jovito Gonzalez , the park 's chief ranger who has worked there since 1966 , says the number of visitors has grown from a mere five hundred a year in the early 1970s to over twentyone thousand in 1993 . " And by April this year there had already been a 34 percent increase over last year . Tourism is increasing at a very rapid rate but , fortunately , the area itself has the capacity to bring in even more people , " Gonzalez explains . <p> Despite its frequently harsh conditions  --  howling winds and unpredictable fluctuations in weather  --  combined with its remoteness  --  twenty-four hours by plane and car from Washington , D.C. ,  --  more than 70 percent of the visitors are foreigners . They come from Germany , Argentina , the U.S. , France , England , Israel , and several dozen other countries and include backpackers , hikers , mountaineers , campers , kayakers , canoers , and nature lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the south , by paved road . Puerto Natales is 160 miles northwest of Punta Arenas , the capital of Region XII . <p> This year , for the first time , the park is open during winter ( April-September ) , when despite the snow , the temperatures usually only drop to the mid-teens and the relentless winds subside . An excellent new five-star hotel , Explora , is catering to upscale nature tourists . <p> Scientists have also been drawn to Torres del Paine . " For biologists it 's like going to heaven , " says Dr. William Franklin , an Iowa State University biologist who for the past fifteen years has carried out research in the park . " It 's well managed , has a very high concentration and diversity of wildlife , a magnificent backdrop  --  snow-covered Andean peaks and iceberg-strewn lakes . It 's pristine and wild . The summers are not overly hot , and the winters are not that cold . It 's a very special place . " <p> Since the mid-1970s , Franklin and his research team have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a wild relative of domestic llamas , and on Patagonia pumas , one of the largest wild cats . The guanaco population " has increased tremendously , " from a few hundred in the 1970s to some twenty-five hundred to three thousand today largely because , Franklin says , domestic animals  --  cattle , sheep , and horses  --  were excluded from the park and poaching is very rare . Now the guanaco population is beginning to decline slightly as pumas , their chief predators , have increased in numbers . Franklin estimates there are ten to twenty-five pumas inside the park , one of the highest concentrations in the Americas . He credits the pumas with " helping to establish an equilibrium between the wildlife and the environment . " <p> Franklin , whose research has been supported by the OAS , National Wildlife Federation , National Geographic , and individual donations , is the only scientist doing long-term studies in the park . His students and fellow researchers also have studied the habitats of foxes and other mammals , waterfowl , and plant communities . He plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park entrance into a " world-class " research facility . <p> Every November Franklin takes tourists on a seventeen-day scientific expedition during which they capture and tag baby guanacos  --  known as chulengos  --  and help collect data . " I 'm a big proponent of wise ecotourism , " says Franklin . " These expeditions are a very valuable tool for my research . I 'm able to use some of the profits to help buy food , fuel , and equipment for our year-round research . " <p> Historically both pumas and guanacos were hunted , and Patagonia ranchers employed leoneros ( lion hunters ) to protect their sheep . In 1980 , Chile prohibited the killing of pumas and most sheep ranchers around Torres del Paine began to raise cattle as well . Franklin has found that within the park both pumas and guanacos " are becoming very tame because people are no longer predators . We see pumas all the time . And so far there have been no attacks on people , probably because the food base is so great . " Franklin says " tourism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park . " <p> The growing importance of tourism has , however , changed the attitudes of nearby residents . Franklin says many of the ranchers " have been my friends and neighbors and we 've often had disagreements . Before , conservation of wildlife was last on their list . But now , with more visitors coming from all over the world , the local people are opening up small hotels and restaurants . They are more respectful of the park because of its economic benefits for the community . " <p> Park ranger Gonzalez concurs . " I 'm surprised to see how Chileans come to Torres del Paine with a very different mentality than when I first arrived here . In 1966 , campers would carelessly destroy the trees . Now people take care of them because they feel that this park is theirs . And we 've seen , for example , Chileans going back behind backpackers , picking up trash . It shows that our efforts as park rangers to educate people have benefited the wild areas . People have gained a consciousness and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful . " Franklin says the park 's rangers and administrators , who " get modest to low salaries and work in rough conditions " are " the real heroes . " <p> To help protect flora and fauna , large blocks of the park are open only to scientists , no off-trail hiking is allowed , camping is confined to specified areas , and climbers must register names and planned itineraries . Gonzalez says one of his biggest concerns is that some climbers have been killed , generally because they were inexperienced , ill-equipped , and did not heed park rangers ' warnings about weather conditions . Therefore , beginning this year all groups " going into primitive areas must be accompanied by a guide " to protect against accidents and forest fires . Because of the fierce winds and poor soil , regeneration occurs very slowly , making forest fires a constant worry for park officials . Gonzalez says blazes set by backpackers have destroyed 17 percent of the park 's vegetation . <p> Despite increased numbers of visitors and higher park entrance fees , Torres del Paine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hire more rangers , organize more training courses , improve and better mark the trails , and develop new circuits within the park . Franklin , however , says he has visited parks in many countries and he is convinced that " Torres del Paine is one of the most successful national parks in Latin America .
