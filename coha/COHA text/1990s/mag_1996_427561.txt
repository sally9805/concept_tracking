Section : WALKER 'S WORLD <p> Switzerland is renowned for skiing , but perhaps really should be known for its dedication to walking and hiking . There are some 31,000 miles of walking trails in a country half the size of Maine , and trails are maintained all year round . That 's why you 're as likely to see a family of walkers heading up the ski lift in December as you are in June . Twenty-four hours after any snowfall , Alpine trails will be clear ! <p> Sound like travel-brochure stuff ? Maybe . But it 's true . When I gathered 20 eager friends and Prevention readers to accompany me on a trip to Grindelwald , Switzerland , last June , we found even more of what makes Switzerland a true walker 's paradise : Scenery that 's easy on the eye and enlivening to the spirit , paths that are continuous with few or no cars . No lions or tigers or bears . No bugs to swat . No poisonous snakes or poisonous ivies . And safe and spectacular modes of transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots , so you can maximize your walking moments in the places with the best views , the cleanest air and the least human interference . Then there 's always ready access to the darkest , milkiest , silkiest chocolate you can wrap your lips around . If you 're wistful for a wonderful walking experience , I encourage you to try Switzerland . <p> I was there on a tour under the guidance of Phil Scheidt , president and expert guide of Wanderweg Holidays . Phil has been leading active vacations in Switzerland and Austria for 18 years . He 's so knowledgeable about the countries , I mistook his lilting accent for Austrian . But he 's actually a homegrown Pennsyl-vania Dutchman who escaped a hectic corpor-ate lifestyle to lead walk-ers through some of the world 's finest alpine scen-ery . On the first day , Phil introduced us to one more thing that perhaps more than anything makes Switzerland the most walker-friendly culture on earth : the wanderweg and bergweg signs . ( See photo , p. 119 . ) These signs appear , pointing in all possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and also at what you and I would consider " sidewalks . " They point to a destination , but instead of giving the distance in kilometers , they tell you precisely how long it will take you to walk from here to there , at the average pace of the local inhabitants . ( These are not estimates , but tried and true numbers . ) Imagine that ! <p> The wanderweg signs are yellow . If they have a red line through a white tip , they are pointing out that this path is a designated bergweg , or mountain trail . It will be steep and you should probably not attempt it without hiking boots and some alpine hiking experience unless you have a guide . The veteran walker will attune immediately to the value of these descriptive signs . In reality , who cares how many kilometers a trail is ? If you have time on your mind , lunch or bathroom stops to make or youngsters to contend with , then " how long will it take us " is the most pertinent of questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile could take as long as a 3-mile walk on gently rolling countryside . These signs have a subtle , but I think , exhilarating effect on a walker 's self-esteem . In Switzerland , walkers count ! Hallelujah ! <p> Signs that point you to some of the most breathtaking views are in the higher reaches of the Alps . We took full advantage of any and all transport up to those regions : trains , cable cars , gondolas , funiculars ( odd little trains that go practically straight up the mountain on one track ; they 're perfectly synchronized to pass each other in a short hop of double track ) . Not only did we save ourselves the grueling effort of steep hiking , we got a riveting , eagle's-eye view of our surroundings every morning . That seemed to put everyone in perfect mood  --  awed  --  for walking through glacier-carved glens and peaks . ACCESSING THE ALPS <p> So how do you partake of paradise ? You do n't have to take the same trip that I did to enjoy what the country has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil assured me that the rest of Switzerland is as walker-friendly as the parts we encountered . <p> I prefer the absolute luxury of a planned walking trip with an experienced guide . ( The biggest decision you have to make once you 're there is what you 'll wear in the morning . ) But you could certainly take a walking vacation in Switzerland on your own if you first do a little planning , book reading and talking to travel agents and tourism boards . ( See " Some Tools for Trip Planning , " below . ) <p> Based on my experience , you 'll want to have a few things in tow : <p> A little bit of German : Unless you know German or one of the many Swiss dialects found region to region , language may be something of a barrier . Though many Swiss speak English , traveling in a foreign country has its stresses , and language is one of them . As an afterthought , I wished I 'd prepared myself with a little friendly German before boarding the plane . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awareness of the local culture . <p> Real hiking boots : While walking shoes are suitable for many trails , hiking boots can give you the support you need for any ascents or descents you attempt . Do n't cheat yourself here . One of our walkers bought an inexpensive pair of boots and ruined her feet for walking after the first two days . Buy from a reputable dealer who can fit your foot . Then wear them walking many times before you leave for your trip . <p> Backpack for layers : Overall , the temperature in Switzerland from June to October is glorious for walkers . Cool mornings , afternoons that can sometimes reach into the 80s , no humidity  --  perfect . But you need a backpack with your rain gear and maybe a few other layers so you 're prepared for changes as you move through the day and the different elevations . Do n't be concerned about altitude . The Alps are walker-friendly , with most of the trails under 7,000 to 8,000 feet high . None of our walkers ( who ranged in age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , headaches or fatigue . <p> Remember that walking downhill may be easy on your lungs , but it can be tough on your knees and your thighs . My quadriceps muscles were quivering like Jell-O after a 40-minute descent through a steep alpine mead-ow . If it had n't been for the cows mooing , their bells tinkling , the stunning view of the snowcapped mountains and the wispy white clouds scudding by beneath me , I might have been disturbed by their weakness . However , as it was , I was too close to heaven to notice . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Walkers can enjoy spectacular Alpine scenery ( like the Oberer Glacier , top ) without strenuous hiking .
