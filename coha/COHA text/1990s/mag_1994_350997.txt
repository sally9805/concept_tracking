A solipsistic imbalance distorts and threatens to destroy William T. Vollmann 's brooding , idiosyncratic novel cycle , Seven Dreams : A Book of North American Landscapes . Corruption of native inhabitants by Europeans is the broad theme of this enormously ambitious project , and the first two volumes , The Ice-Shirt , about Greenland , and Fathers and Crows , about the settling of Quebec , presented the author 's bleak argument with stinging force . What he argues for is a vision of absolute evil : civilization , native cultures not excepted , is a pestilence , and mankind is a monstrous curse laid upon nature . <P> Where the imbalance enters is in an irritating secondary theme , scored for piccolo . That theme is William Vollmann , whom the author finds boundlessly fascinating . He ca n't stay out of his own novels , and he capers in and out of them , representing himself typically as William the Blind , a very clever , very naughty historical voyeur . The first volumes of the Seven Dreams cycle are successful novels despite Vollmann 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Viking ; 411 pages ; $22.95 ) , is an exasperating hash of fiction , op-ed attitudinizing , men 's magazine heroics , cut-and-paste history and confessional autobiography . <P> The mixture does not work , partly because the historical and the personal plot lines that Vollmann imagines to be parallel simply are not . One of the former is the death in 1846 of Sir John Franklin and all the members of his British navy Arctic expedition , sent to find the Northwest Passage . Vollmann relates that event to a glum romance in present time between one of the author 's fictional alter egos , whom he calls Captain Subzero , and a young , deaf Inuit woman named Reepah . Vollmann insists at length that Subzero , an &; Arctic tourist who , as Vollmann himself did , makes a two-week trek to the north magnetic pole , is a modern counterpart of Franklin . Further and sillier , he imagines that Reepah bears some resemblance ( or shows some useful contrast ) to Franklin 's wife Lady Jane . <P> The juxtaposition is absurd : Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courage and blind arrogance of 19th century Britain , but Subzero and Reepah are simply dreary . And Subzero , picking moodily at the scab of his 20th century conscience , fretting that the Inuit find him contemptible , giving tips on Arctic trekking ( down sleeping bags collect moisture and freeze ; masturbation at very low temperatures is n't worth the trouble ) is just not as interesting to Vollmann 's readers as to the author himself . <P> Too bad ; further volumes may resurrect the promising Seven Dreams cycle ( of which this is to be the sixth volume in chronological order ) , but for now the tiresome self-indulgence of Rifles has stopped it dead .
