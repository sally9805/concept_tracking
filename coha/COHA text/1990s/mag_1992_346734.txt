Great ideas are often generated in the most unlikely places , or so claims photographer P.F. Bentley , whose latest brainstorm occurred while he was having dinner at a sushi bar in Nashua , N.H. Bentley was part of the press corps covering the state 's first-in-the-nation primary , and he was trying to devise a more personal approach to the campaign . Then it hit him : Why not portray a run for the presidency from the inside looking out ? A few days later , P.F. told associate picture editor Rick Boeth that he 'd like to hook up with the Clinton campaign , a risky choice because the Arkansas Governor 's candidacy was in deep trouble at the time and his aides were naturally suspicious of becoming involved with the press . " P.F. used all his considerable finesse and diplomatic skills to convince everyone in the campaign that he could be a part of their lives , " recalls Boeth . <P> That hunch led to the special series of photos that appear in this week 's issue . Initially , Bentley and Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt sufficiently comfortable with the arrangement to continue it indefinitely . " We both understood that he would have to instantly trust me , " says Bentley . Campaign advisers were told to get used to the photographer 's presence in meetings , and Hillary Clinton welcomed him to the family home in Little Rock . The first photos , published in late March , ended with a Clinton win in Illinois . Since then , Bentley has been privy to the Clinton campaign 's controversies , days of triumph and stolen moments of calm . His photos capture the gritty reality of rumpled hotel rooms , late-night strategy sessions and quick dinners of cold pizza , all shot in black-and-white to emphasize the documentary nature of the project . <P> P.F. , 39 , lives in Stinson Beach , Calif. , grew up in Honolulu and has been a TIME photographer for 13 years . His TIME campaign coverage won first place in the Pictures of the Year Competition in both 1984 and 1988 . In addition to his U.S. political coverage , Bentley has shot assignments in Panama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I am not in the room at all , and we can go a couple of days without speaking to each other , " observes Bentley . " I 've found him to be the most casual politician I have ever worked with . " So casual , in fact , that P.F. actually followed Clinton into the steam room of his New York City hotel last week . The intrepid photographer could take only two exposures at a time before the cameras fogged up and had to be cleaned  --  but eventually got the shot he wanted .
