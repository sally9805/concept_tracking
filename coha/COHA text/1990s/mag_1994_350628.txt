" These foundations are a wonder to behold , " says George Trentz wistfully as he stands before a row of crumbling concrete walls , virtually all that remains of the former Kaiser Steel Corp . ' s mill in this town , an hour 's drive east of Los Angeles . The plant , once 20 stories high and 100 yds. long , has been reduced to a ruin , and as workers with acetylene torches continue their cutting , Trentz watches the factory where he worked for years literally disappear before his eyes . If it were simply another smokestack victim of America 's decline in manufacturing , it would just be allowed to sit and rust . Something stranger is happening , though : the plant has been sold to the Chinese , and they are taking it apart rivet by rivet and shipping it back to . their country , where they will rebuild it to help satisfy China 's insatiable industrial appetite . Thought to have expanded at a torrid rate of 13% in 1993 , China 's economy has been the fastest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Looking at the piles of rubble and scrap , it is hard to imagine that when it opened in 1978 , the Basic Oxygen Process Shop No. 2 , known as " the BOP shop , " was among the most formidable steelmaking facilities in the world . The two huge Voest-Alpine furnaces could produce up to 2.8 million tons of high- grade carbon steel annually . But soon after Kaiser built the plant ( at a cost of $287 million ) , the company encountered new environmental regulations and rapidly rising union wages that made the mill noncompetitive with overseas producers . Within five years Kaiser shut the plant down . For a decade the BOP shop came to life only occasionally as a movie set  --  in 1990 , for example , the finale of Arnold Schwarzenegger 's apocalyptic Terminator II was filmed here . <P> Then , in late 1992 , the Shougang steel corporation of Beijing agreed to pay $15 million for the plant . Soon after , 290 engineers and laborers arrived from China to begin packing up their new possession . After being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a boxcar  --  is numbered and labeled in Chinese characters to ensure that the 60,000-ton jigsaw puzzle can be reassembled correctly back home in China . The furnaces now hang oddly in the open air , but within weeks they will be lifted from their cradles and made ready for transport to the port at Long Beach . <P> " China could build a new steel mill like this one , " says Wang Shengli , who is overseeing the project . " We bought this one because we can have it operating sooner than if we built our own . " The mill will be put up in the southern Guangxi region ; the cost of dismantling , moving and reconstructing it will be at least $400 million . <P> The Fontana mill is the largest plant bought in the U.S. and taken home by the Chinese , but it is hardly the only one . In North Carolina the Chinese picked up a secondhand nuclear-plant control room , in Pennsylvania they purchased a used microchip-making facility , and in Michigan they bought an auto-engine assembly line . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the steel , microchips and engines made in these newly exported plants may ironically come back to America one day  --  as imports .
