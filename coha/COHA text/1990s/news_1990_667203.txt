<p> Increasing evidence that mercury in " silver " dental fillings could be hazardous to health may cause the Food and Drug Administration to re-examine the use of the 150-year-old substance . <p> Silver amalgam fillings - presently in 100 million mouths - are 50% mercury . Experts generally agree that a small amount of mercury from fillings gets into the body . The debate now centers on whether it causes health problems once it gets there ; the newest information indicates it might . <p> An FDA-sponsored panel , meeting next March , is expected to consider recommendations on the use of amalgam , and " there is a possibility of a change in regulations , " says Gregory Singleton , chief dental officer for the FDA . <p> One such possibility : a new classification for amalgam , " so that sometime in the future manufacturers of these particular products would have to provide safety and effectiveness data . " <p> Research showing mercury from amalgam causes kidney malfunction in test animals - in this case sheep - was reported earlier this month by a Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vimy 's new research on primates will be published next month in the journal of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology . <p> And new evidence , from infant cadavers , will show mercury passes through the placentas of mothers with silver fillings and accumulates in infant brain tissue . <p> This latest research - sponsored in part by Sweden 's prestigious Karolinska Institute - is being prepared for future publication . " There is transportation of fairly high concentrations of mercury from the mother to the brain of the fetus , " says Dr. Magnus Nylander of Stockholm . " And that is a warning . " <p> The Swedish government strongly recommends against using amalgam in the mouths of pregnant women . It is considering a ban on the substance altogether . But the American Dental Association has issued a statement reaffirming its position that " dental amalgam is a safe , effective restorative material . " <p> " There is no reason for the public to be concerned and no reason to seek removal of fillings , " says ADA spokesman Chuck Green . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eggleston , researcher and dentist with the University of Southern California School of Dentistry , suggests worried patients " discuss alternative materials when a new cavity is found , or a silver filling has to be replaced . " <p> But patients - including pregnant women - should not request wholesale removal of silver fillings . " I am concerned some will become hysterical over this issue , " Eggleston says . <p> " Sometimes when fillings are removed patients are exposed to more mercury than if the fillings are left alone . " <p> In addition , when amalgam is removed , " there is a temporary elevation of mercury in the blood , " Eggleston says . " The first trimester of pregnancy would be of particular concern . " <p> Some experts are also made uncomfortable by dentists too eager to pull fillings . Eggleston worries " the issue is being used by some dentists to revitalize failing practices . " <p> Within the next five years the issue just might become moot , Eggleston says . " Dental amalgams will be phased out because of better materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The FDA says its concerns about mercury in current fillings are fairly new . " It was not until the last few years that we even knew mercury was coming out of fillings when one chews , in amounts so small we could n't measure it , " Singleton says . " Now we have extremely sensitive instruments to measure the mercury vapors . " <p> He adds , " But what do those amounts mean ? Do they have any significance to the health of the patient ? We do n't really know , and we 're looking for more information . <p> " We welcome studies like the Vimy study , " Singleton says . " They are headed in the right direction - the actual effects of amalgam in one 's mouth . " <p> Told of the upcoming infant brain tissue study , Singleton says , " We would definitely be interested in seeing that . " <p> Amalgam fillings are 35% silver ; 15% tin or tin and copper ; a trace of zinc ; and the rest , mercury . The FDA approved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK 'd certain substances already in wide use . <p> Vimy claims if the FDA were evaluating amalgam today as a new product , the group would disallow it because " it failed tests in animal models . " <p> Vimy 's results still do n't impress the majority of dentists . <p> " I do n't have any hesitancy about using the material at all , " says Dr. Heber Simmons Jr. , a Jackson , Miss. , dentist and past president of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry . " It has proved safe and effective for almost 150 years . And I want nothing but the best for the children I see . " <p> Adds Baltimore dentist Linda Niessen , " If I were concerned about the exposure of me or my patients to mercury , I would n't use it . " <p> The Calgary studies , Eggleston says , " must be replicated by other research institutions before we can change the practice of dentistry . You ca n't change it based on six sheep . " <p> But if the studies hold up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Thursday 's New England Journal of Medicine cites the mercury in fillings as " possibly the chief source of exposure of a large segment of the U.S. population . " And it notes , " many important medical questions concerning mercury toxicity remain to be answered . " <p> TEXT OF GRAPHIC : Dental dilemma The materials that make up most fillings may be harmful . A look at what a filling is made of and some suggested alternatives : AMALGAM FILLINGS Mercury 50% Silver 35% Tin 15% or tin and copper ( and a trace of zinc ) . ' SILVER ' ALTERNATIVES <p> Experts caution against wholesale removal and replacement of silver dental fillings . But there are alternative materials that can be used when a new cavity is found , or when a silver filling has to be replaced . Some substitutes suggested by USC researcher and dentist David Eggleston : <p> - Porcelain resin composites . These work well for small fillings , but are less durable in larger restorations ; color of natural tooth ; same price as amalgam , from $ 50 to $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20-30 years ; natural color of tooth ; prices range from $ 400 to $ 800 ; crowns often include layer of gold . <p> - Gold inlays or crowns .
