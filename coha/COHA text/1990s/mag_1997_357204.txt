In Salt Lake City , Utah , on a block known informally as Welfare Square , stands a 15-barreled silo filled with wheat : 19 million lbs. , enough to feed a small city for six months . At the foot of the silo stands a man  --  a bishop with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  --  trying to explain why the wheat must not be moved , sold or given away . <P> Around the corner is something called the bishop 's storehouse . It is filled with goods whose sole purpose is to be given away . On its shelves , Deseret-brand laundry soaps manufactured by the Mormon Church nestle next to Deseret-brand canned peaches from the Mormon cannery in Boise , Idaho . Nearby are Deseret tuna from the church 's plant in San Diego , beans from its farms in Idaho , Deseret peanut butter and Deseret pudding . There is no mystery to these goods : they are all part of the huge Mormon welfare system , perhaps the largest nonpublic venture of its kind in the country . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the replacements will be taken away . <P> But the grain in the silo goes nowhere . The bishop , whose name is Kevin Nield , is trying to explain why . " It 's a reserve , " he is saying . " In case there is a time of need . " <P> What sort of time of need ? <P> " Oh , if things got bad enough so that the normal systems of distribution did n't work . " Huh ? " The point is , if those other systems broke down , the church would still be able to care for the poor and needy . " <P> What he means , although he wo n't come out and say it , is that although the grain might be broken out in case of a truly bad recession , its root purpose is as a reserve to tide people over in the tough days just before the Second Coming . <P> " Of course , " says the bishop , " we rotate it every once in a while . " <P> For more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ of Latter-day Saints suffered because their vision of themselves and the universe was different from those of the people around them . Their tormentors portrayed them as a nation within a nation , radical communalists who threatened the economic order and polygamists out to destroy the American family . Attacked in print , and physically by mobs , some 30,000 were forced to flee their dream city of Nauvoo , Ill. , in 1846 . Led by their assassinated founder 's successor , they set out on a thousand-mile trek westward derided by nonbelievers as being as absurd as their faith .
