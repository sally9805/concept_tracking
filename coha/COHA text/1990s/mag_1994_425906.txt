Fred Barnes <p> I recommend two political books for different reasons . One is , at once , the best book I 've read on President Clinton , the best piece of reporting in recent years , and the best page-turner in non-fiction : The Agenda : Inside the Clinton White House . Bob Woodward insists he 's not a liberal , and this book strengthens his case . He 's got Clinton and his aides pegged . No , the problem is n't staff . No , it 's not the chaos that sometimes strikes White House operations . The problem is the chaos inside Clinton 's head . He ca n't make decisions , thus leaving himself vulnerable to whoever pressures him most intensely , usually liberals . <p> The other is Dead Right , by David Frum . He dislikes that new breed , the " big government conservative . " He gives me credit for coining the phrase . Thanks a lot . I wish I 'd never heard of it . My idea was n't big spenders , but those who 'd rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search of spending cuts in Social Security , Medicare , etc. , that never materialize . Frum argues , from a libertarian argument , for breaking your pick . It 's an interesting argument , one conservatives need to hear , then reject . <p> I read few novels , but I grabbed a paperback my 12-year-old nephew left behind . It was Killer Angels by Michael Shaara . The subject is Gettysburg , and Shaara sides with Longstreet against Lee . Absolutely riveting , the best ( though maybe the only ) historical novel I 've read since I went through those books by Kenneth Roberts as a teenager . <p> Fred Barnes is a senior editor of the New Republic . <p> L.D. Brown <p> Not being one to miss anything related to Bill Clinton , however remote , I recommend Life of the Party : The Biography of Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman by Christopher Ogden . Biographer Ogden takes hours of conversations with Harriman , who at the time was collaborating with him on a memoir of her life , and transforms it into a hefty volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harriman got cold feet on the project and bailed out , Ogden continued on and produced a timely expose of her life from her childhood through her celebrated marriages to Randolph Churchill , Leland Hayward , and Averell Harriman and on to being the real " first lady of the Democratic party . " <p> Having met Mrs. Harriman while in Washington , D.C. with then-Governor Bill Clinton , I think Ogden has truly captured the real Pamela Harriman , who reveals her thoughts at the time on the man who would eventually reward her with the ambassadorship to France . <p> I 'll not miss the opportunity in this space to suggest you reread William Manchester 's One Brief Shining Moment , a recollection of John Kennedy 's presidency . Commissioned by the late Jackie Kennedy Onassis , it will be interesting to see if Bill Clinton can commission someone to write such a glowing tome after he leaves office . Even the master Manchester may not be able to pull this one off . <p> L.D. Brown is an Arkansas State Trooper . <p> Robert P. Casey <p> First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Justice . Hadley Arkes ' clear , provocative , and witty treatise on moral reasoning . <p> Plain Speaking : An Oral History of Harry S. Truman . Merle Miller 's marvelous portrait of an American original and a forgotten art . <p> Battle Cry of Freedom : The Civil War Era . James M. McPherson 's epic account of America 's defining moment . <p> Chronicles of Wasted Time : An Autobiography . Malcolm Muggeridge 's brilliant memoir . <p> Shane . Jack Schaeffer 's timeless western about a reluctant but deadly gunslinger saving a group of struggling farmers . <p> Before the Shooting Begins : Searching for Democracy in America 's Cultural War . James Davison Hunter 's account of the current struggle for the soul of America . <p> Our Country : The Shaping of America from Roosevelt to Reagan . Michael Barone 's magisterial rendering of modern American political history . <p> Robert P. Casey is the governor of Pennsylvania . <p> Dick Cheney <p> Over the years , my favorite books have been about American history  --  and in particular , military history . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review some of the most recent books on World War II . One of the best is D-Day : June 6 , 1944 , by the historian Stephen Ambrose . In magnificent detail , Ambrose recounts the battles at Omaha and Utah beaches . By focusing on the individual troops in the field  --  from the enlisted men to the generals  --  Ambrose allows the reader to witness the bravery and strength of our armed forces under the most demanding wartime environment . <p> Leaping forward a few decades one gets to Al Santoli 's Leading the Way . This oral history of the Vietnam War is a riveting portrait of a generation of troops who proudly served our nation in Southeast Asia and then  --  upon returning to this country  --  passed through one of the most difficult times for our armed forces . Many of my good friends and colleagues from the Pentagon  --  Gens . Colin Powell , Barry McCaffrey , Freddie Franks  --  remained committed to the U.S. military and led the way toward restoring the dignity and professionalism of our armed forces . <p> To appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of rebuilding , one can turn to Washington Post reporter Rick Atkinson 's Crusade  --  one of the best accounts of Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm . As well as any reporter I 've read , Atkinson moves seamlessly between interagency meetings in Washington and the decision-making and actual fighting in the desert . <p> In a completely different category of books , I 'd recommend James Cannon 's Time and Chance . Cannon traces Gerald Ford 's early political career in Michigan , his impressive rise in the U.S. House of Representatives , his selection as vice president , and finally his assumption of the presidency . Cannon reminds us that Ford 's greatest professional ambition was to become House Republican leader ; he never sought the vice presidency much less the presidency . Yet he served in the White House honorably and with great distinction and bravely led our nation through one of its most turbulent times . <p> Finally , being a lifelong fly-fisherman , I console myself when not actually fly-fishing by reading about it . Although I 've plowed through several new titles this year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Originally published in 1938 , Bergman 's book has been reprinted thirteen times . It 's the most complete text on trout fishing available both for the experienced angler and the novice . As the 1975 introductory note says , " In Trout , waters will forever run pure and sparkling and fish will rise in clear , untrammeled streams . " <p> Dick Cheney is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and the former secretary of defense . <p> Arthur Cooper <p> Henry and Clara , by Thomas Mallon . The best novel of 1994 . People will be reading it in 2094 . Unless Newt Gingrich gets the bomb . <p> Catch-22 , by Joseph Heller . The funniest novel ever written by an American , I think it 's the closest we 've come to The Great American Novel . <p> Cocksure , by Mordecai Richler . The funniest novel ever written by a Canadian . Actually , Richler has also written the second , third , and fourth funniest novels ever written by a Canadian . <p> A Moveable Feast , by Ernest Hemingway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation want to starve in Paris for art . None of us starved . None of us wrote anything worth a damn . <p> The Nine Tailors , by Dorothy Sayers . The great English mystery . Lord Peter Wimsey and Ms. Sayers at the very top of their game . <p> A Piece of the Action , by Joseph Nocera . A lucid , impeccably researched history of personal finance that is exquisitely reader-friendly . There are as many " characters " in this book as in a Dickens novel . <p> Arthur Cooper is editor-in-chief of GQ . <p> Bob Dole <p> Aside from wading through the 1,342 pages of the Clinton health care plan this year , I have recently had the pleasure of turning the pages of several good books . I would like to recommend the following titles : <p> Beyond Peace , by Richard Nixon . President Nixon 's last book was also his best  --  a compelling analysis of world affairs , common sense solutions for America 's domestic problems , and a call for a return to American leadership . <p> D-Day : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitive account of the young soldiers who put their lives on the line to ensure the survival of democracy . <p> Truman , by David McCullough . For some reason , I loved this fascinating biography about a no-nonsense straight-talking senator from the Midwest who became president . <p> Eisenhower , by Stephen Ambrose . President Dwight D. Eisenhower , a fellow Kansan , has served as a role model throughout my career . Not only was Eisenhower an admirable chief executive , but he also was a great commander of those he led in the Army . To date , this book is my favorite source of Ike inspiration , <p> The American Red Cross First Aid and Safety Handbook . This handy reference book might save the life of someone in your family . <p> Bob Dole is the Republican leader in the United States Senate . <p> Malcolm S. Forbes , Jr . <p> The best but most underpublicized book of 1994 is Bruce Porter 's War and the Rise of the State : The Military Foundations of Modern Politics . Beginning with medieval Europe , the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chapters on the U.S. are superb . Liberals wo n't be happy to learn how important war was as a catalyst for social reforms , and defense-minded conservatives will choke as they read how a strong military invariably means a powerful central government . Other worthy reads include Cal Thomas 's The Things That Matter Most , Frederick W. Marks 's excellent set of essays , Velvet on Iron : The Diplomacy of Theodore Roosevelt , David Halberstam 's October 1964 , Bob Woodward 's Agenda , and for all its flaws , Peter Schweitzer 's Victory , which properly credits the Reagan administration 's critical role in winning the Cold War . The novel of the year is Chris Buckley 's Thank You for Smoking , with Michael Crichton 's Disclosure , a close second . <p> Malcolm S. Forbes , Jr . is president and chief executive officer and editor-in-chief of Forbes Magazine . <p> David Frum <p> Demosclerosis by Jonathan Rauch searingly condemns a political system paralyzed by greedy , short-sighted gim me groups . The Ethics of Culture by Professor Samuel Fleischacker attacks a liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must nearly always originate in religious orthodoxy . Finally , conservatives who hope that the next Republican White House will avoid the debacles of the last one must commit to memory John Podhoretz 's Hell of a Ride  --  a brilliant and hilarious portrayal of abject political failure . <p> David Frum is author of Dead Right ( New Republic Books ) . <p> John H. Fund <p> In this time of revolutionary political change in America , my suggestions for Christmas gift books focus on the lessons we can learn from the demise of Communism . I believe Bill Clinton will be to welfare-state liberalism what Mikhail Gorbachev was to the Soviet Union  --  a transitional figure who tried to keep a failing system alive but actually accelerated its collapse . Here are some books that help us hasten the collapse of liberalism 's Berlin Wall : <p> Imperium , by Ryszard Kapuscinski . A Polish foreign correspondent , Kapuscinski gives a surprisingly witty and insightful perspective on the collapse of the Soviet Empire . As a citizen of a Warsaw Pact nation , he was allowed far greater access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : How Information Ended the Soviet Union , by Scott Shane . Shane , a Moscow correspondent for the Baltimore Sun , tells the fascinating story of how the Soviet system was undermined by the new information technologies and the growing press freedom the Gorbachev regime was prompted to tolerate . Not only was George Orwell wrong in 1984 , he was spectacularly wrong . Thank goodness . <p> The Private Life of Chairman Mao , by Dr. Li Zhisui . Mao 's doctor for twenty-two years reveals that the Great Helmsman was actually just a minor-league Stalin , but with even fewer friends . <p> Of course , one should n't ignore American politics completely . Ralph Reed , the executive director of the Christian Coalition , provides a fascinating overview of what ails America and how ordinary citizens are taking their country back in Politically Incorrect : The Emerging Faith Factor in American Politics ( published by Word Publishing , Dallas ) . After reading this book , I concluded that conservatives have very little to fear from the activities of Christians in politics , and they should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their corner . <p> The growing consensus that our welfare system has imploded should rekindle interest in one of the best public policy books I 've ever read : The Tragedy of American Compassion , by Marvin Olasky , a fascinating discussion of how early social workers combated poverty until the Progressive Era . Help was a two-way street . The poor were expected to improve their lot , or in dire cases do something , anything , that contributed to society and allowed them to keep their dignity . <p> Finally , I recommend a real treat to remind us of how fascinating British politics can be for an outsider  --  combining as it does high moral purpose and sordid behavior . Mrs. Thatcher 's Minister : The Private Diaries of Alan Clark . These splendid memoirs by Britain 's former minister of defense will never be read by an American politician . They are far too frank and literate . <p> John H. Fund is an editorial writer for the Wall Street Journal . <p> Georgie Anne Geyer <p> Amusing Ourselves to Death , by Neil Postman , professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so good  --  so original , so necessary to read to understand our times  --  that I simply can not understand why Postman is not so wildly famous that his phone is ringing off the wall . He traces for us the way that the human personality has actually changed as we passed from the print age to the television age . The unfortunate corollary , at least as it seems to me : " there 's no going back . " Absolutely brilliant . ( And his later book , Technopoly , is good , too . ) <p> The Impossible Country : A Journey through the Last Days of Yugoslavia , by Brian Hall , an excellent political travel writer living now in Ithaca , New York . If there is one book to read on " Bosnia , " which is becoming the archetypal tragedy of the post-Cold War syndrome , it should be this one . Hall takes the reader by the hand , introduces him to these tragic worlds-within-worlds with their orchestrated hatreds . <p> The Democratic Imagination : Dialogues on the Work of Irving Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Horowitz , the prestigious professor of sociology at Rutgers University  --  and he well deserves one , for he is one of the few true searchers after truth still in the academy , a man who portrays things the way they are and not the way the political correctors insist they be . A group of his multitude of friends write about his " other " way of thinking . <p> Hollywood vs . America : Popular Culture and the War on Traditional Values , by Michael Medved . You can never read this book too many times . It is unique in telling us the dismal story of why Hollywood insiders do truly hate the America they supposedly represent . Most unfortunately but not surprisingly , nothing has changed since this book was published in 1992 . <p> Haunts of the Black Masseur : The Swimmer as Hero , by Charles Sprawson . If you are a swimmer , or even if you simply think there is nothing quite so beautiful on God 's earth as rivers , bays , oceans , seas , and even swimming pools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives of all the great people who loved swimming . You see ultimate romanticist Byron swimming in the Hellespont and the drunken Jack London floating out to sea while roaring death chants at the starsaltogether a perfectly wonderful little book . <p> Georgie Ann Geyer is a columnist syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate and author of the new book Waiting for Winter to End : An Extraordinary Journey Through Central Asia ( Brassey 's ) . <p> James Goldsmith TABLE <p> Sir James Goldsmith is a businessman and member of the European Parliament . <p> Paul Greenberg <p> Democracy in America , by Alexis de Tocqueville . Only prophetic when it was written in the 1830s , now it is relevant . See the perfect description of Political Correctness in Volume II , Chapter VI , " What Sort of Despotism Democratic Nations Have to Fear . " Or the description of the true power of American women in Volume II , Chapter XII , " How the Americans Understand the Equality of the Sexes . " Or the sections on the role in American life of private associations , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , saw , and perceived . <p> Vico 's Science of Imagination , by Donald Philip Verene . Hannah Arendt demonstrated the root of fascism , Nazism , and Communism in her Origins of Totalitarianism . The trouble , it seems , began with the French Revolution , as Edmund Burke knew it would . Readers of Vico will realize that all the trouble goes back to the Renaissance , to Descartes . This is a fine introduction to , and summary of , a heroic mind and his road not taken by the world . <p> All the Pretty Horses , by Cormac McCarthy . Beware the sound of these Texican words ; they will move you to speak your own truth unadorned  --  which is to ask for trouble . This long , long ride will exhaust and refresh and bring moments of unbearable revelation and recognition that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up prickly as a dog 's . And you will no longer be the same , or you 'll be a lot samer . <p> Franz Rosenzweig : His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of this theologian and anti-theologian , poet and teacher , seeker and finder who died young of Lou Gehrig 's Disease is only a little more inspiring than the simple , shattering , inundating light of his words . This is a clear , restrained telling of his life that lets its power come through , together with a finely chosen selection of his words . <p> Pirke Avot : The Ethics of the Fathers . This is the famous , inexhaustible little talmudic treatise on ethics . Forget the volumes of commentaries ; stick to the slim text , and avoid the more modern translations . Ponder each perek , or chapter . The best commentary will be your own . Take a piece of advice from the book itself : Provide thyself with a teacher and find a companion for study . <p> Paul Greenberg is editorial page editor of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette whose column is distributed by the Los Angeles Times Syndicate . <p> Christopher Hitchens <p> I thank providence that , because of a mediocre television series , I was in effect actually paid to reread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of the reviewer is seldom so peachy , berry , and skittle , and anyway I 'm not invited to recommend the classics , so let me just defend the idea of reading as hedonism against the notion of literature as social science . In fiction I was much taken by The End of the Hunt , Thomas Flanagan 's rounding of his trilogy about Irish history . ( It was to have been titled The Heel of the Hunt , but some fool thought that all Americans both use and misunderstand Mickey Spillane vernacular . ) Joanna Trollope 's The Men and the Girls caught me in its snare of humane wit . I also followed Gore Vidal 's advice and took in all of Dawn Powell , which is very good on women on men . Salman Rushdie 's collection of stories , East West , is the latest refutation of Orwell 's deceptive dictum that the imagination , like certain wild creatures , will not breed in captivity . In the political column , Noel Malcolm 's Bosnia : A Short History was a great work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul ( at least when Serbian ) invocation of race , nation , and empire . The other outstanding political book of the year was also penned by a conservative . H.R. Haldeman 's Diaries make the clearest connection yet between small-time crookery and big-time , serious crime . <p> Christopher Hitchens writes the " Cultural Elite " column for Vanity Fair and the " Minority Report " column for the Nation . His collection , For the Sake of Argument , is freshly out in paperback . <p> Ojars Kalnins <p> William Manchester 's A World Lit Only by Fire is wonderful to read and even better as a reminder that regardless of how difficult , confusing , irrational , and dangerous life seems to be today , it has been much worse . While a glimpse at the distant past helps put the present into a more comfortable context , recent history , as brilliantly analyzed by Zbigniew Brzezinski in Out of Control , has a more sobering and instructive effect , especially useful to those who are thinking about where we should be in the future . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most book stores , Morgan Llwelyn 's fascinating novels about the ancient Celts ( I have so far read The Druids and The Bard ) offer a beguiling mix of history , spirituality , and adventure . In between all this , I find myself returning to Goethe 's Faust about once a year , just to be reminded that " freedom and life belong to that man solely who must reconquer them each day . " <p> Ojars Kalnins is Latvia 's ambassador to the United States . <p> G. Gordon Liddy <p> The Jerome Biblical Commentary . An extraordinary work of scholarship that puts together , at one 's fingertips , all that scholars of various religions , archaeologists and so on have learned to date about each Book of the Old and New Testaments . <p> The Book of Virtues , compiled by William Bennett . Do n't even try to raise a child without it . <p> Modern Times ( revised edition ) , by Paul Johnson . A succinct , thoughtful presentation of where we are and how we got here . <p> Commentary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Niccolo Machiavelli . Still the most modern work on politics available to us . <p> Guns , Crime and Freedom , by Wayne LaPierre . Essential to an understanding of the meaning of the Second Amendment and how it undergirds all our freedoms and obligations under the United States Constitution . <p> Public Education : An Autopsy , by Myron Lieberman . The biggest problem facing the future of this country is the failure of the public education system . This book offers a scholarly and critical analysis , with suggestions as to what to do about it . <p> Tower of Secrets , by Victor Sheymov . True story of the conversion and brilliantly executed ( and highly dangerous ) defection of the most important member of the KGB ever to come over to the side of freedom . <p> G. Gordon Liddy is a nationally syndicated radio talk show host as well as writer , lecturer , actor , and businessman . <p> Thomas Mallon <p> Three old ones : <p> Letters of John Keats . " We read fine things but never feel them to the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With these letters a reader can take Keats 's great , gutsy journey with him . The only dead immortal writer one would truly like to have met . <p> Vanity Fair . Not Tina 's or Graydon 's , but Thackeray 's . The best English novel . Ever . <p> Memories of a Catholic Girlhood , by Mary McCarthy . The most deeply felt book by a woman who defined style as " lucidity , perspicuousness , " and who had it in every word , including " and " and " the . " <p> Three new ones : <p> The Bird Artist , by Howard Norman . Creepy , spare , and sometimes slightly ridiculous , this novel about murder and redemption in 1911 Newfoundland certainly " has something , " as they say , even if , in this case , it 's hard to say just what . <p> Mrs. Thatcher 's Minister , by Alan Clark . Everything The Haldeman Diaries are not : egotistical , judgmental , hilarious . Clark is no more capable of self-censorship than Boswell or Pepys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a good deal more terrifying than " P. " <p> Case Closed , by Gerald Posner . The author rides a leaf-blower across the grassy knoll , scattering every kook , auteur , and quick-buck artist who ever addled the nation 's brains over the Kennedy assassination . Common sense has rarely been so exhilarating . <p> Thomas Mallon 's most recent book is Henry and Clara ( Ticknor &; Fields ) . <p> Adam Meyerson <p> Escalante : The Best Teacher in America , by Jay Mathews . Read this book before signing on to Charles Murray 's argument that IQ is the best determinant of academic and economic achievement . Intelligence tests would never have predicted that Garfield High School in working-class , Mexican-American East Los Angeles would become one of the nation 's ten top high schools for Advanced Placement Calculus . What made the difference were three math teachers , Jaime Escalante , Ben Jimenez , and Angelo Villavicencio , who set high expectations , taught math the way coaches teach football , and , fighting the designed-for-failure public school system all the way , inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and succeed . <p> Truman , by David McCullough . When Policy Review profiled seven Western leaders who did the most to win the Cold War , we featured Harry Truman , along with Ronald Reagan , Winston Churchill , Pope John Paul II , Konrad Adenauer , George Meany , and Whittaker Chambers . Truman , who had the moral courage to save millions of lives by dropping the atom bomb , and who built the Cold War alliance against Soviet Communism , was the last Democratic president who knew how to handle foreign policy . McCullough 's biography masterfully tells the story not only of Truman 's political career , but also of an education and upbringing in small town Missouri that was right out of Bill Bennett 's Book of Virtues . <p> Modern Times , by Paul Johnson . This tour de siecle by one of England 's preeminent journalists is still the finest single volume political history of Planet Earth in the twentieth century , a period in which " The power of the State to do evil expanded with awesome speed " while " its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Cold Sassy Tree , by Olive Ann Burns . One of the best American novels of the past decade , this is an endearing story of a young man growing up and a grandfather growing young in rural turn-of-the-century Georgia . Fourteen-year-old Will Tweedy is a marvelous boyhood hero in the tradition of Tom Sawyer , a mischievous rebel who steadily grows in maturity as the teachings of experience and his elders reinforce his natural kindness and moral principles . <p> Adam Meyerson is vice president for educational affairs at the Heritage Foundation , and editor of Policy Review . <p> Andrew Neil <p> The Economist on America : 150 Years of Intelligent British Commentary on America by the World 's Most Influential News Magazine . Written and edited by Sir Alastair Burnet , who edited the Economist for ten years , then went on to become Britain 's Walter Cronkite . <p> Rethinking AIDS : The Tragic Cost of Premature Consensus , by Robert Root-Bernstein . The most authoritative debunking of the many American myths about AIDS peddled by an unquestioning media in the pockets of the AIDS Establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIDS epidemic and never will be ; and why to be HIV positive is far from being the death sentence conventional wisdom would have us believe  --  because HIV does not cause AIDS . <p> The Oxbridge Conspiracy , by Walter Ellis . A provocative analysis of how graduates of Oxford and Cambridge have kept their stranglehold on the British Establishment and because of the anti-business snobbery these universities impart how this has contributed to Britain 's decline . As Ellis concludes , " Britain under Oxbridge is a failed experiment . " <p> The Bell Curve : Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life , by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray . Murray , the author of Losing Ground , which revolutionized the debate about welfare , turns to the even more controversial matters of genes and intelligence , arguing that those who do n't succeed in the American meritocracy fail largely because they are not bright enough . This book is likely to dominate intelligent discourse this winter : read it if you want to participate in the debate . <p> Thieves ' World : The Threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sterling . A frightening study of the rise of the post-Communist Russian Mafia , the fastest-growing , most violent organized-crime group in the world , whose tentacles are spreading west in a way that makes it almost as big of a threat as Marxism , especially since , as Sterling shows , the Russian Mob is linking up with other organized crime groups to form a global network . <p> The Agenda : Inside the Clinton White House , by Bob Woodward . At times it is far too " inside the Beltway " and some of its sourcing is suspect . But it still manages to paint a convincing , authoritative picture of a rudderless administration devoid of values or strategy . <p> Andrew Neil is editor of the Sunday Times of London and executive editor of Fox Television 's " Full Disclosure . " <p> Fred L. Smith , Jr . <p> As a policy wonk , my recommended reading list , not surprisingly , is wonkish .

Read this book and learn why poorer is sicker and wealthier is healthier . A wonderful story teller and brilliant thinker , Wildavsky in these rabbinical tutorials on modern foolishness does much to explain the ongoing inquisition against technological and economic growth . <p> Essays on Economics and Economists , by Ronald Coase . This is the latest collection of essays by one of the few Nobel Prize economists whose work is actually relevant to the real world . Coase 's style is delightful , saving his fiercest jabs for " blackboard economics " and the central planner 's mentality . <p> A Rebirth of Values , by Frederick Turner . A series of essays by an under-read author who dares suggest that mankind can actually be a positive force in an evolving earth . The essay , " Towards a New Bioethics , " extolling man as gardener rather than despoiler , is a much-needed antidote to the Blame-Mankind Firsters who dominate the green agenda . <p> Lost Rights : The Destruction of American Liberty , by James Bovard . A modern-day Common Sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual liberties are being eroded away by an arrogant and unconstrained Leviathan . As this book becomes more widely read , Americans are very likely to rise up in anger , making the current political turmoil seem but a tempest in a teapot . <p> Science Under Siege : Balancing Technology and the Environment , by Michael Fumento . A book that might be subtitled , " Lies , Damned Lies , and the EPA " dealing with the horrendous misuse of science and statistics by environmentalists over the last two decades . Fumento , CEI 's 1994 Warren Brookes fellow , is perhaps the only journalist in the world able to write about epidemiology without making a fool of himself . ( Another important book is Eco-Scam : The False Prophets of Ecological Apocalypse , by Ronald Bailey , who was CEI 's 1993 Warren Brookes fellow . ) <p> The Lord of the Rings , by J.R.R. Tolkien .

I do n't know of any other picture of government in action at its best that can match it . <p> Herbert Stein is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute . <p> <p> <p>
