<p> Two years later , former prosecutor Mara Larson says she still relives her professional nightmare : she had rested her case against a man charged with murder only to learn that he was innocent . <p> Worse yet , Larson contends , the Harris County homicide detective involved in the trial of Dominique Garcia knew that another man might have committed the crime but allowed her to proceed . <p> " " The whole investigation was botched , " said Larson , who is now in private practice . " " It 's almost as though ( the detective ) made up his mind what happened and framed the investigation accordingly . " <p> The detective , Frank Pratt , now an eight-year veteran in the homicide division , declined comment . <p> His superiors insist that Pratt did nothing wrong , even though the 1991 incident prompted a letter of reprimand for him and a change of policy at the Sheriff 's Department regarding the handling of witness statements . <p> Larson and her former boss , District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr. , view it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they see as the detective 's casual regard for the truth in the Garcia case . <p> " " I told ( Sheriff Johnny ) Klevenhagen I would n't have that son of a gun working for me another second , " Holmes said . " " If you 've got evidence of innocence , you 've got to let the prosecutor know about it . It 's pretty basic stuff . " <p> On the morning of April 24 , 1991 , Garcia 's murder trial came to a sudden halt while authorities investigated new evidence that seemed to exonerate him . A new suspect , Rene Carrasquillo , was arrested that afternoon , confessed immediately , and later pleaded guilty to the murder . He was sentenced to 15 years in prison . <p> Garcia , who had spent 216 days in jail awaiting trial , found himself a free man . Through his attorney , he declined a recent request to discuss the case . <p> Then 19 , Garcia had been charged with the June 3 , 1990 , shooting of Larry Alvarado , who had celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route to another bar . With him were his wife , their 4-year-old granddaughter and a waitress to whom they were giving a ride . <p> On Aldine-Westfield , Alvarado saw several men fighting near a beer joint and pulled the car to the side of the road . Hoping to mediate , he hurried back to the group , became involved in the argument and was shot . <p> Larson went to trial on the basis of statements from two witnesses interviewed by Pratt : the child , who had turned around in the car 's front seat in time to see her grandfather shot , and the waitress , who was getting out of the car and did not see the incident clearly . <p> Both picked Garcia out of a photo spread as the man who shot Alvarado , an account made more plausible because he was among those on the scene . <p> What Larson did not know was that five others had given statements to Pratt that named Carrasquillo as Alvarado 's killer . <p> She learned about them halfway through trial when Garcia 's attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why she had not shared their statements with him . Prosecutors are required to do so during the pretrial process known as discovery . <p> Stunned , Larson asked to speak to the witnesses , who were waiting in a hallway outside the courtroom . She was suspicious at first because all were relatives or friends of Garcia , but decided they might be credible after one produced Pratt 's business card . <p> The judge recessed the trial while attorneys investigated . <p> Larson asked Pratt to bring his case file to the courthouse . <p> " " When he pulled his file out , it was a good half-inch thicker than the one I had , " the prosecutor said . " " Obviously , I was missing some stuff . <p> " " I asked Pratt why I did n't have these statements . His response was , " I sent them to you in the mail . ' But he had never done anything to make sure I had them , " Larson said . <p> It also became clear that the detective , apparently convinced of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said . <p> Capt . Candy Henderson , who heads the homicide division , said Pratt sent the statements to the district attorney 's office through inter-office mail and should not be blamed because they did not arrive . <p> Since then , however , detectives who send such statements to the district attorney 's office are required to hand-deliver them and wait for a signed receipt , she said . <p> Henderson and other sheriff 's officials also intimated that Larson was at fault for not meeting with Pratt before trial . <p> " " It 's easy to point the finger at the detective but maybe the prosecutor was n't prepared for trial , " Sheriff Johnny Klevenhagen said . " " She had n't met with the detective . " <p> But Larson said that because of a bad experience with Pratt in another murder trial , she tried to keep his involvement in Garcia 's case to a minimum . <p> Outside the courtroom , Larson read the statements , then asked the detective what he had done to investigate Carrasquillo . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything , " she said . <p> Pratt told her he had lost a photograph he had been given of the suspect and had not tried to obtain another . He had not run Carrasquillo 's driver 's license number . And although he knew what kind of car the man drove , he had located it only once , parked near a school , without its driver . <p> Pratt also said he had Carrasquillo 's address , but had made only one attempt to find him there . Nearly 10 months later , investigators arrested the suspect at the same address . <p> " " I was speechless , " Larson said . <p> Henderson acknowledged that Pratt did not believe the witnesses who implicated Carrasquillo and did not pursue their story . And even now , the homicide captain said she is not convinced Pratt had the wrong man , despite Carrasquillo 's guilty plea . <p> " " These people were family and friends of the defendant and in Frank 's mind , they were not credible witnesses , " Henderson said . " " Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt was more credible . " <p> Larson and Holmes responded that it was not the detective 's job to make such decisions . <p> Garcia later filed suit against Pratt , Klevenhagen , Larson , Holmes and Harris County . The suit was transferred to federal court , then dismissed , partly because attorneys could not show that specific policies in the Sheriff 's Department or district attorney 's office had led to his plight . <p> But Larson remains angry and troubled about Pratt 's handling of the investigation and his continued tenure with the Sheriff 's Department . <p> " " I have relived this case hundreds of times and I know that everyone 's human but he 's the cop , he 's the investigator , he 's the one that 's been trained to do this , " she said . " " There was too much there to ignore . A lot of times , prosecutors get cases that are not investigated to their liking , but we 're not the investigators . We 're trained to take it into the courtroom . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he said was , " You 've got an investigator . You go find out . ' And we did . "
