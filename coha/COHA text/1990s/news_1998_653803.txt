<p> If one looks closely at the opening credits of " Gone With The Wind , " one might see a flagpole that is not really attached to the building from which it is jutting . The flaw results from a crude 1930 's special effect , combining a real flagpole with a painting of a building . <p> Now , the 1939 movie classic is going to be restored and re-released for its 60th anniversary . Should the flaw be fixed or retained as an intrinsic part of the original masterpiece ? <p> The question , albeit somewhat trivial , is an example of those being raised by a powerful new technology  --  digital film restoration . For the first time , the images within a frame of film can easily be altered . The restored film can thus be arguably " better " than the original , or at least different . <p> " With digital , if you can think it you can do it , " said Marty Cohen , head of post-production at the Dreamworks studio . " If you want to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . " Indeed , George Lucas digitally added new creatures to some scenes of the " Star Wars " trilogy when the movies were re-released in 1997 . <p> Digital technology is adding yet another element to the passionate debate over what is appropriate in film restoration . Are old movies artworks , to be preserved in their original state , or products , to be upgraded to retain their consumer appeal ? <p> Both considerations  --  cultural preservation and profit  --  have spurred increased interest in film restoration . With the explosion of cable and satellite television channels and home video , movie studios have realized there is gold in their libraries of old films . But these old films were often not properly stored , or not even stored at all . It is estimated that about half the films made before 1950 are lost and many made since then are fading and deteriorating . <p> Film restoration is also getting a push from new technology , like high-definition television , that display clearer images . Splotches and crude special effects will become less acceptable as viewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from now , it 's all going to look like chopped liver , " Matt Mazer , an industry consultant who was formerly president of Sony New Technologies , said about many older films . " The flaws in well-beloved titles will be obvious . " <p> Already , German television is rejecting some American programs because the visual quality is not up to its standards , said Robert T. Walston of the Four Media Company in Burbank , Calif . The company just cleaned up the " I Dream of Jeannie " series , though not digitally , so that it could be shown in that country . <p> Digital restoration involves scanning film to convert each frame into a digital image . These images can then be displayed on a computer screen and manipulated by an artist using a mouse or a digital pen and tablet . The repaired image is then recorded back onto film . This is similar to the controversial process that some magazines and newspapers have used to alter photographs . <p> Digital technology allows film restorers to do things that are difficult or impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved trying to make new exposures from older negatives , color separations or other components . <p> With digital technology , scratches , tears and dirt can be erased and the space filled in with pixels identical to those nearby or borrowed from the preceding or following frame . Flickers caused by lighting or other artifacts can be eliminated . <p> And images can be changed to correct mistakes . In restoring Disney 's " Fantasia , " artists filled in a shadow for Mickey Mouse missing from one frame and the foot of an animal missing from another , said Jerry Pooler , visual effects supervisor at Cinesite , a Hollywood company owned by the Eastman Kodak Company that did the restoration . <p> But digital has its detractors , as well . Purists complain that the digital systems have lower resolution than film itself , so the resulting restoration , while clear of dirt and scratches , can lack the visual richness of the original . <p> Robert A. Harris , a noted film restorer , said that movie special-effects houses , which are moving into digital film restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can lack the proper sensitivity . " You ca n't take a digital technician who is putting giant wildebeests and giant cockroaches in a sci-fi movie and say , ' O.K. , we 're going to move you over to film restoration , ' " said Mr. Harris , who , with his partner James C. Katz , has restored films like " Lawrence of Arabia " and " Vertigo " using older optical and chemical techniques . <p> But the biggest obstacle right now is the $1 million to $5 million cost to restore a film digitally , several times that of using photochemical techniques . A movie might have 200,000 frames that must be cleaned up at an average rate of about 15 frames an hour . Each frame requires up to 50 megabytes of storage , meaning high computer costs . <p> So far , the only studio using digital restoration on a consistent basis is the Walt Disney Company , whose animated " Snow White " was the first film to be fully digitally restored in 1994 . <p> OCS/Freeze Frame , a Hollywood special-effects house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Ray E. McIntyre Jr. , vice president and chief of engineering . He said his contract with Disney prohibited him from identifying the movies . <p> EDS Digital Studios , which is owned by Electronic Data Systems and is making perhaps the most aggressive push into digital film restoration , has restored nine complete films and parts of two others . EDS Digital 's president , Greg Granello , would not identify his major client , although it has been reported in the trade press to be Disney . <p> But Disney can recoup its restoration costs by re-releasing the films to a new generation , something that is not possible for most other movies . So digital restoration is being used mainly for small parts of films that can not be fixed any other way . <p> Even " Star Wars " used digital technology only to enhance special- effects scenes , said Phil Feiner , executive vice president of Pacific Title/Mirage , a Hollywood house that worked on the project . Most of the film was restored using older techniques and the dirt was cleaned off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of digital restoration is expected to go down because of the inevitable progress of computing . Another cost saving could come by having the computer do some work automatically , like identifying dirt spots and erasing them . But in some early attempts at this , the computer erased the eyes of Disney cartoon animals . <p> " Developing these automated processes is really key to making digital work , " said Grover Crisp , executive director of asset management and film restoration for Sony Pictures . Sony , along with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences digitally restored " Matinee Idol , " a 1928 Frank Capra silent film that was presumed lost until a battered print was found in France . <p> Restorations often include footage not in the original film . Even before digital restoration came along , colorization was widely condemned . <p> Seagram 's Universal Studios is cooperating in the reconstruction of Orson Welles 's " Touch of Evil . " Using digital technology , the film will be recut in the way Welles intended , with quick scene changes , based on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overruled him . <p> But many of the new uses so far are for more subtle changes  --  fixing such things as the flagpole in " Gone With the Wind "  --  that resulted from sloppiness or the limits of technology at the time the film was made . <p> Some say even those changes are wrong , akin to efforts to fix the poor sense of perspective in pre-Renaissance paintings . The goal should be to " restore the original achievement , " not the presumed original intention of the film maker , Michael Friend , director of the film archive at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , said at the recent Post/LA conference for the post-production industry . <p> Richard P. May , vice president of film preservation for Time Warner 's Warner Brothers , which now owns " Gone With the Wind , " said the errant flagpole would probably not be fixed . Mr. May , who also spoke at the conference , said , " To change something just because we have the technology to do it , I am , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Mr. Granello of EDS said that once a film is reviewed frame by frame , making it easy to spot flaws , studios are tempted to fix them . Disney , according to Mr. McIntyre , is digitally repainting animation to eliminate color fluctuations in the original hand-painting . <p> In the future , some believe , studios might archive their films and television programs in digital form , which could then be distributed easily via digital television or the Internet . Sony Pictures is archiving its programs in digital high-definition television format . And more programs are being recorded in digital form . But for now , no digital format has the richness of film and some question how long digital media , like magnetic tape and CD-ROM 's , can last .
