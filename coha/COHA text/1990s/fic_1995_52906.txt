He had a pleasant face , in a reliable , unhandsome way , and his warm brown eyes and easy smile made Amy want to believe the best in him . His name was Jacob Tumbull , the crisp brown uniform and two IDs proving that he came from the library dealership . Gazing at the camera above the sealed front door , he said , " You have myrtle problems , as I understand it . " He lowered his passport , then brightened his smile . " Something about John Wayne riding into battle on a fire-breathing dragon . Is that right , Ms. Taylor ? " <p> " Oh , " she exclaimed , " it 's a lot more than that . " <p> Referring to the reader on his belt , he laughed and said , " And something about the shape of the world , too . " <p> " It 's round , " she blurted . <p> " Yes , ma'am . I know . " <p> Amy said , " But my son does n't . Our library taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with holes at both ends . " <p> " It 's a common myrtle , ma'am . " <p> " Can you help me ? " Did she sound anxious ? Vulnerable ? Or just crazy ? <p> Crazy would be the worst , she believed . " I do n't dare let him read or watch anything . I mean , he 's a boy . He does n't understand  --  " <p> " Yes , ma'am . " <p> " The library is lying to him ! " <p> " Ms. Taylor , " he said , " I want to help . But first , I need to examine your equipment and determine the extent of your trouble . " <p> " ' A purge and refill job . ' That 's what I was told to expect . " <p> " Eventually , yes . " He sighed , shrugging his shoulders . " But first I need to check the hardware , then I 'll have to protect all the files that belong to you and your family . A general purge would erase them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said , " I understand , " without meaning it . A long truck was parked at the curb , and she focused on its license , jotting down the number because she did n't trust her library to record this critical detail . Then she touched a button , saying , " Come in , " as the door unsealed with a menacing kla-chunk . <p> These were clever , malicious times . <p> What if she 'd just invited a thief into her home ? <p> Yet Mr. Turnbull did n't appear the least bit criminal . Looking nowhere but at her , his eyes showed nothing but a bloodless , professional interest . And she still could n't relax , blurting out , " My husband 's going to be home soon . Maybe any minute . " <p> " Yes , ma'am . " <p> " Do you need me to show you the library ? " <p> The face only hinted at amusement . " It would help , yes . " <p> Then from behind : " Mom ? Who is it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son was wearing shorts and an unflattering mesh shirt , and he was sweating , a large orange ball in his hands and his breathing damp and fast . In a secret way , she was glad the library was broken . Her son needed this exercise . She knew it as surely as she knew she should do it too , but then again , he was young enough to change his ways . A vigorous game in the playroom was a good thing . Harry had inherited her fat-hoarding genes , and that was just another thing to make her lie awake in fear . <p> " You 're the myrtle man , " said Harry . <p> " I am , " the invader confessed . <p> Amy motioned . " It 's just upstairs . " She took the first few stairs , then paused and looked over her shoulder . <p> " I 'm following , " the myrtle man promised . " Lead on . " <p> " So where 's your cable ? " asked Harry , something suspicious in the tone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stuff . " <p> " I will . My stuff 's in my truck . " <p> Harry waited for an instant , then said , " I found the myrtles . " <p> " Did you ? " <p> " Well , a bunch of them . " <p> " So , " the man asked , " what 's the shape of the world ? " <p> " Round , " Harry replied , almost growling . " That 's what Mom says . " Amy hesitated on the top stair , remaining silent . <p> " It is round . How can it be anything else ? " The myrtle man laughed , then asked , " What 's your name ? " <p> " Harry . What 's yours ? " <p> " Jacob . " <p> " It says Jacob on your shirt , " Harry observed . <p> " Very astute . " <p> " What 's astute mean ? " He shouted up at his mother , " Can I look up ' a-stute ' ? " <p> She said , " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the library , suddenly angry . " Because it 's lying to us , Harry . Did n't I tell you ? " <p> Jacob seemed oblivious of them . Walking into the little room , he stopped and turned in a slow , observant circle , saying , " Oh , this is a fine one . A beautiful old Universal , is n't it ? " <p> She could n't say . <p> " A Universal 8 . No , it 's the 9 . " <p> " Is it ? " <p> " Twenty years old , if it 's a nanosecond . " Jacob began to stroke the bindings of the false books , then pulled on one as if to test its falseness . No , it was rooted in place . It and the others were camouflage for the machinery set within , the sum total of human knowledge  --  every published word and painting video and photograph , plus every recorded musical and dramatic performance  --  existed in a digital form , literally at their fingertips . <p> As were the damned myrtles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , " said Amy , as if to apologize for its age . " We thought about buying a new one  --  " <p> " Do n't , " Jacob interrupted . <p> She hesitated . <p> Grinning , he said , " The new ones are smaller , and faster too . I know . " Another stroke of the bindings . He had long hands , she noticed . Kind hands , perhaps . " If you 're worried about running low on capacity , buy Universal Add-Ons . Another shelf or two would double your space , and you 'd keep this ambiance . " <p> " Mom , " said Harry , " what 's ambiance ? " <p> There was a reader in one comer  --  the most unused reader in the house . Jacob sat , adjusting the chair to fit his lanky frame . Then he activated the library , asking , " What was your first sign of trouble ? " <p> Amy beat Harry to the answer . " The cowboy on the dragon . " <p> Jacob laughed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather loved John Wayne . He would have hated that myrtle . " On the view screen , in perfect color but without sound , a one-eyed actor rode across a mountain meadow on the back of a golden dragon . " If you ask me , the best myrtles are the subtle ones . The ones we do n't suspect . " <p> A " best " myrtle ? She doubted there was such a thing , but she wanted to appear interested . " What subtle ones ? " <p> " Well , like with this cowboy . Back when the first libraries came on the market , some of the actor 's fans managed to insert a lot of modest changes into them . Some fans removed his weight . Others made him look younger , more idealized . But what really matters , and what 's hardest to spot and remove , are the doctorings that made him a better actor . Someone gave him more feeling , a better sense of timing . Things more subtle than subtle , if you know what I mean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at her , shrugging . " Nine out of ten libraries , if they have n't been thoroughly demyrtled , carry the new and improved John Wayne . People who watch do n't know better , and why should they ? We get better movies as a consequence . " <p> On the screen , in vivid orange and red , the dragon spit up a ball of fire , incinerating the bad men and setting an entire mountainside ablaze . <p> " That 's my favorite part , " said Harry , with conviction . <p> " Tell you what . " Jacob winked at the boy . " I 'll save it for you . We 'll make a special category and keep it , and you can watch it whenever you want . " <p> " Great , " the boy squealed , jumping until his belly jiggled . <p> " Honey , " said his mother , " why do n't we leave Mr. Turnbull alone ? He 'll call us when everything 's fixed . " <p> " I do n't want to go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me all the good stuff ? " <p> With a mixture of charm and inviolable authority , the myrtle man shook a finger , remarking , " The best stuff is always saved , Harry . When you 're older you 'll see what I mean . " <p> After a lot of complaining , Harry left them , exiled to the basement . But despite her own pledge to leave the myrtle man alone , Amy lingered in the doorway , watching him work while telling herself that she was n't suspicious or unfair . Libraries were important appliances . She kept telling herself that it was time to learn about the damned things . <p> " Do you know where ' myrtle ' comes from ? " <p> She blinked her eyes several times . " Pardon me ? " <p> " The term . The concept . " Jacob was squatting on padded knees , an incomprehensible tool in one hand , a dusty component in the other . " Back in ancient times , even before this 9 was built , a top library designer gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to lies told by the software that computers , gullible and possessing perfect memories , would believe without hesitation . Without end . " What was he saying ? She waited , unsure what to think . <p> " In the speech she told a story about her Aunt Myrtle  --  have you heard it , ma'am ?  --  who would leave her house lights burning all day and all night . And why ? Because when Myrtle was a little girl she was told that most of the cost of any light came when it was turned on . It only stood to reason that if you never turned the light off , you saved money and energy in the long run . Right ? " <p> Amy could believe Myrtle 's logic . But then again , she had no feel for technological questions , deciding just to nod and say , " I guess so . " <p> " For a while , " said Jacob , " we called them aunt myrtles . " <p> " Who ? " <p> " The untruths accepted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aunt ' was dropped . " <p> Amy was a teenage girl when libraries became cheap enough to afford and yet rare enough to appeal to snobs . The attraction of the machines was genuine enough . To be able to say , " I own the sum total of human experience , " was always an impressive statement . <p> Jacob said , " They 're called myrtles , and most of the human race knows what the word means . The fictions that our machines believe to be truths , and because we believe our machines , we can be fooled , too . I mean , what choice do we have ? " <p> She considered her myrtles . The worst of them , she believed , were a lot more dangerous than leaving the lights burning all night . After a cleansing deep breath , she confessed , " Harry has found other things , too . " <p> " Kids do , ma'am . " <p> " There 's not a planet on the other side of the sun , is there ? One just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't . " <p> " I knew that . " She took another breath . " I mean , Harry loves science . I do n't know why , neither of his parents do . But he does , and I let him study what he wants , just so long as he finishes his tutor 's assignments . " A pause . " He 's being educated at home . " <p> " I know . Here 's your AI . " He patted the shell of an old dictionary . " It 's a popular model . Very strict . " <p> " It showed Harry a map of the solar system , and there was this second earth hidden by the sun . " She hesitated , reading something in the man 's expression . " What 's wrong ? " <p> " That AI would n't be fooled by such a big myrtle . When it accesses maps of the solar system , it accesses thousands of them , ignoring the odd ones . " He paused , giving a charming little wink . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While exploring . " <p> " I see . " <p> " And you 're probably asking : Why find that one out of the millions of available maps ? Because these myrtles are aggressive . The most aggressive ones spread fastest and always put themselves where they can be noticed . " An expansive shrug . " why invent an elaborate myrtle just to keep it a deep , deep secret ? " <p> She could understand his rationale . <p> " On this other earth , " asked Jacob , " are the people left-handed ? " <p> " I think so . Yes . " <p> " Oh , that 's an enormous myrtle . " He blew the dust from several components , then slipped them into his shirt pocket . " You can access a history of that world , build a globe of it , even find census figures and photographs taken from every spot on its surface . In a lot of ways , frankly , it 's a lovely place . " <p> " It does n't exist , " she complained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . You are right , ma'am . " <p> " Harry says that the dinosaurs killed themselves with H-bombs . That 's a myrtle . " <p> " I hope so , " said Jacob , grinning . <p> She watched as he opened a service port , then said , " I believe in home educations . " <p> " Many do . " <p> A pause , then she asked , " Do you have children ? " <p> " Yeah . Two . " <p> " Do you have a tutor for them ? " <p> " In part . But they go to public school in the afternoons . My ex-wife and I decided that was best . " He almost glanced at her , then used a tiny vacuum cleaner to pull dust out of the port . " I guess it 's for the social skills , and to keep them out of my ex 's hair . " <p> Amy did n't mention her feelings about public school , but she suspected they showed on her face and in the wringing of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , purge and replace the science files . " <p> She said nothing . <p> " But usually , particularly with an old Universal , there 'll be a lot of myrtles . All kinds . " He fastened a jeweled device to the port , then rose and punched commands into the reader 's keyboard . " Every nanosecond of every day , you 've got new information arriving . New zeros and ones . There 's always that chance in some of them being myrtles . " <p> " I know , " she replied , in disgust . <p> Numbers , tiny and compacted , appeared on the full screen . <p> Amy said , " We bought filters to keep them out . I do n't remember when . A couple years ago , I think . " <p> " Five years ago , I think . " Jacob gave a wise shrug . " I saw them , ma'am . " <p> " Well , " she groaned , " are n't they working ? " <p> " Honestly ? They were n't the best skeptics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Average modern skeptics would do better . " <p> That 's right , they were n't called filters . She remembered being rather offended by the idea of mechanical agents watching what entered their library , knowing better than her what was genuine . And now she braced herself , ready for the sales pitch , this man counting on her ignorance and fears to sell her the very best at an inflated price . <p> Except Jacob made no such offer . Instead he asked , " Have you or your husband noticed other myrtles ? " <p> Her husband ? It took Amy a moment to remember her fib about him coming home at any moment . <p> " Any other myrtles , ma'am ? " <p> " Well , " she began , " I like reading mysteries . Quite a lot , really . And I 've been noticing some that sound new , but their authors have been dead for years . " <p> " They 're new books , probably . " <p> " I thought so . " <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ones . " Jacob paused , studying a stream of senseless numbers . " Fans write them and slip them into the Net traffic . With the right camouflage , a poor home library does n't know better . " <p> She said nothing . <p> " Or sometimes , fans improve a classic . Or at least try . " He touched buttons , fingers blurring . " What else have you noticed ? " <p> " Well , " she said . And hesitated . <p> " Yes ? " <p> " I like paintings . Landscapes , I put them on the big screens in my favorite rooms  --  " <p> " Your living room walls are blank , I noticed . " <p> " It was suppose to be a Monet , and it looked like his style . " She was sorry to have begun this confession , but the weight of it was irresistible . " The painting was . . . it seemed . . . pornographic . . . . " <p> " Ah ! " he exclaimed . The long fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to report , " This is n't a prime number . It only looks prime . " <p> She could n't count the digits beneath his hands . <p> " Something slipped it into math text . As a joke , probably . " A joke ? <p> " AIs , ma'am . They've'got their own sense of humor . " He shrugged and blanked the screen . " AIs are a different kettle of guppies . In old times , myrtles were human-made . But nowadays , with all these advanced programs and their hardware linked to the Net , with all this imagination to burn . . . . Well , a lot of myrtles come from bored AIs . " <p> Amy felt an enormous , imprecise fear . In an effort to sound strong , she said , " I do n't like lies . In fact , I hate them . " <p> " Good for you . " <p> She approached her library , fingers touching the plastic bindings that showed , despite twenty years of existence , no trace of wear . The bindings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly ones . She willed herself not to see the irony . <p> " This is a guess , but it looks as if you have n't had a purge in ten years . " Jacob reclaimed his jeweled device . " If I may ask , how long have you and your husband lived here ? " <p> " Seven years . " The blame was n't all theirs . <p> Jacob punched numbers into his own little reader , then with a steady professional voice informed her , " I can do a complete purge , then a restandardization . If you wish . This is the cost , including labor and parts , and taxes too . The total is on the bottom . " <p> Amy could n't read the numbers . Stress made them swirl , and she had to squint and concentrate , even then needing to read them twice . <p> " I can do it today . If you want . " <p> Had the myrtle man said something ? She was n't sure . <p> " I can do cheaper , stopgap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry , ma'am . " <p> She had failed , and not for the first time . If pressed , she would break down now , confessing to a string of private failures . <p> " Ma'am ? Are you all right ? " <p> Almost without breath , she asked , " May I make a call ? " <p> " Naturally . " <p> " To my husband , I mean . " <p> Jacob touched her on the shoulder , very lightly , and with a voice both sympathetic and strong , he said , " Take your time , Ms. Taylor . I 'll wait , and you take all the time you need . " <p> The instant Amy saw the expected face , she launched into a harsh summary of her morning , losing momentum only when the face grinned , a soothing voice saying , " Take it easy , little lady . " <p> It was n't Dan ; it was his goddamn answering program . <p> " I want to talk to him , " she warned . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rested , flattering  --  gave a big grin before saying , " He 's occupied just now , darling . " <p> " Well , " she replied , " tell him to pull his dick out and call me . And I mean soon . " <p> The grin persisted , the image of a sunny apartment behind it , out of focus in the stylish way that was now fashionable . " I 'll deliver your message , little lady . Is there anything else ? " <p> She blanked the screen , stood and froze in place . When it came to her husband , Amy had a simple role : He wo n't make me cry with his first shot . And she managed to remain dry-eyed and sober , opening her bedroom door and walking to the library , finding Jacob sitting at the reader , conspicuously doing nothing . <p> He glanced at her face , eyes asking what he should do . <p> " You can start , " she muttered , wondering how she looked to him . Under stress , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose husband had abandoned her for women ten years her junior , all lean and well-rested . " What will you do ? Pull your cable up from your truck ? " <p> " Eventually . If you 're willing , that is . " <p> A nod . Brief , crisp . <p> " If you do change your mind , " he offered , " we can downgrade my work . If it 's soon enough . " <p> Jacob seemed like a very nice man , she was thinking . All men , in some private teflon-lined part of themselves , were the most decent people . It was a lesson she could n't learn often enough ; and with a wave of her hand , she told him , " Do whatever you need . Clean everything . Put in skeptics . I do n't care . " <p> Harry helped the myrtle man . <p> Despite his mother 's wishes , and her fears , the boy touched the fancy tools and kept very much underfoot , asking large questions while he pretended to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money fashioning clay pots by hand ; some people were willing to pay for good craftwork . But she did n't want to leave the two boys alone . Alert as a security camera , she watched Harry tug at the plastic-coated cable , giggling at some private little joke . Walking past her , humming as he played , he said , " We 're going to empty the library , More . Get a bucket . A big , big bucket . " <p> Everyone was laughing . <p> Shaking her head , she said ; " I know better , " and closed the front door as far as possible , the cable unwilling to dent . <p> Jacob said , " Ms. Taylor ? I need to make sure what 's yours . " <p> Of course . They went back upstairs , and she discovered that he had already arranged the files between private and public realms . What was public was enormous  --  the earth next to a grain of sand  --  yet on the reader it seemed perfectly balanced with her house records and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Harry , " I put your cowboy on the dragon in here . It 's with your own digital designs . " <p> " What about the other stuff ? " <p> " Tell me what you want . " <p> Harry rattled on about the left-handed earth , the one he still partway believed in despite his old mother 's denials . With an expertness that startled her , he put up images of blue surf and bluer seagulls , describing this tropical beach as if he was its discoverer . <p> The reader emitted a quiet musical tone . <p> " Dan calling . Line one . " <p> Amy retreated , apparently unnoticed . Again in her bedroom , the door closed and her sitting on the bed , she put the call on the full screen , then snapped , " You 'll be getting a bill . " <p> Dan looked tired , though certainly for different reasons than hers . Measuring her at a glance , he decided to look perturbed and unfocused . " A bill for what ? " <p> She told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Did you ever have the library serviced ? " <p> " I ca n't remember , " he lied . " I thought I did . " <p> " It gets fixed or your son goes to public school . Unless , of course , you want to enroll him at an academy . " <p> " We ca n't afford that . " Dan gave a weary sigh . " How much did you say ? " <p> She repeated the figure , thinking too late of inflating it by some cruel percentage . <p> " But did you shop around first ? " <p> She said , " Yes . " <p> " Pay half , " he advised . <p> " You bastard . " <p> " Oh , god . Are you going to fight me again ? " <p> " For the rest of your life , " she advised . " If you do n't meet your obligations , what can I do ? " <p> " What I 'm saying is that we both pay half . . . then we let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The lawyers were useless . They squabbled worse than she and Dan could manage , being highly trained professionals . <p> " How 's Harry ? " <p> " Why do n't you ask him ? " <p> There was that hesitation , instantaneous but unmistakable , that told her this was n't a good time . But he said , " All right , " because good fathers always want to talk to their sons . " I mean , if he 's there and not too busy . " <p> " Not at all . " She blanked the screen , then called up one of their private , protected files . Two months ago , as a birthday gift , Amy took Harry to a portrait studio where they made elaborate digitals of him moving and speaking , asking him endless questions in the process . Around that information they built a computer simulation of him . It was much more sophisticated than an answering program . These simulations were fads in the past  --  probably years ago , Amy realized  --  but she had assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was n't it said that twins were never alone ? Except he did n't use it often or for long , which meant that his mirror image was never quite up to date on his life . <p> Yet his father did n't seem to notice . <p> She had Dan talking to the simulation , a couple minutes passing and no hint of enlightenment or anger . <p> Slinking out of the bedroom , she felt a mixture of poisonous glee and calm fury . What kind of father could be fooled by a false son ? she asked herself . And what kind of woman happily marries such a blind , stupid pig ? <p> The library had been purged , untainted knowledge was flowing into the newly made emptiness . <p> Amy watched for a while , then said , " I was wondering , " without knowing quite what she wanted . " Could I possibly , when you are n't too busy . . . could I see that truck of yours ? " A pause , then she added , " I 'm sure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside a control panel , the boy unconsciously mimicking the man 's posture . It was Harry who brightened , telling her , " I can take you , Mom . " <p> That was n't what she wanted , but she remained silent . <p> Jacob read her expression , at least in part . With a paternal pat on the shoulder , he said , " Do me a favor , Harry ? Watch everything . " He spoke as if he had told hundreds of boys these words . " Watch but do n't touch , and I 'll be back in a few minutes . " <p> Harry groaned . <p> Laughing Jacob informed him , " You 'll live . " <p> Amy led the way until they were outdoors , then they walked together , cool air and a high gray sky causing her to cross her arms against her chest . Why was she nervous ? It took her a moment to remember why . Jacob leapt into the truck 's open back end , then offered his hand , the strong forearm making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial-grade library halfway filled the truck . <p> She had expected a humming sound , some sense of machinery hard at work ; but the loudest sound besides her own quick breathing was a mild , dry click-click-click that came from nowhere and meant nothing . The machinery was a wonder of efficiency and compression , Plastic panels encased the countless circuits , and Amy touched the panels , feeling a very slight heat that might have been her own heat reflected back at her . She gave a weak cough , then sighed , growing aware of Jacob 's gaze . She forced herself to say , " Very nice . " <p> " ' Everything we know ; everything we are . ' " He chuckled , adding " As of seven o'clock this morning . " <p> She could n't speak . <p> " Certified , " he told her , fingering some kind of glass tag . " The Bureau of Libraries its own self guarantees our purity . " <p> With a dry mouth , shy said , " You know all about this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confidence in balance . <p> " And you know about myrtles . " She glanced at him . " You know a great deal about them , do n't you ? " <p> " More than some know . " <p> " Can you make myrtles ? " <p> " Anyone can . " <p> " Good ones , I mean . Ones that get past the skeptics . " Ones that are noticed , she thought . <p> The brown eyes were capable of shrewdness . " For what purpose ? " <p> " For money , " she blurted . Then , as if to make it more clear , " For me . Because I 'd like to hire you . " <p> " To do what , ma'am ? " <p> " I 'm separated from my husband . " Her arms tried to cross on her chest , lacked the strength and fell at her sides . " He is n't coming here soon . I just said that . " A pause . " I did n't know you before . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we can agree on terms , I 'd like you to  --  " <p> " Excuse me . Ma'am ?

" Something to make my husband look ridiculous . I was thinking , I do n't know . . . we could put him inside a filthy digital . I 've seen the homemade ones  --  " <p> " Who has n't ? " <p> " Could you ? I mean , what would you charge ? " <p> " To embarrass him , you mean . " Jacob almost smiled . " You 're angry , and you want revenge . " <p> She imagined her husband fucking a goat . In clear detail , she saw him behind a big shaggy angora , fighting it , trying to screw it while the goat twisted and bleated and kicked . <p> Jacob said , " I wo n't .

He saw a bitter , ineffectual woman  --  true enough  --  and she wanted to run or scream , anything but stand by passively while this working class technician spoke to her . <p> Yet that 's what she did , hearing the words and the steady click-clicks between them . <p> " I never finished my story , " he said . <p> He said , " About the origins of the word ' myrtle .

Is that what you 're telling me ? " <p> A rakish wink and nod . <p> " I guess I am , " said Jacob , offering a hand to help her climb down again . " There you go , ma'am . " <p> He ate lunch with Harry and her . The work was finished by three , most of the afternoon spent checking his work and installing top-grade skeptics . By then Amy had enough confidence  --  in him and in herself  --  to invite Jacob back for dinner . As much as anything it was because of Harry 's affection for the man ; and Harry overheard the offer , bursting into the library and squealing " Please come , please ! " <p> The myrtle man had another job waiting but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be late . <p> True to his word , he was late by two hours , full of stories about his client who had wanted to find certain lost files . They were comedians , though later , replaying them in her mind , Amy could n't discover why they had seemed funny , attributing their joy to the spirited teller . <p> Jacob left before ten , praising the reheated dinner as he excused himself . He would n't return ; Amy was certain . Drifting into Harry 's room , she blanked the reader , nine authentic planets vanishing to black . Then she went to her room , closing the door and undressing lying on her covers , using her right hand with an expertness , eyes closed , an imaginary man who could have been Jacob hovering over her . <p> Two days later , when Harry was visiting his father , the myrtle man reappeared . He wore jeans , not the uniform . He apologized for coming on a Saturday and for every inconvenience , but he wanted to know if her library worked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " Good . " Then he gave the air above her head a shy glance , asking " Would you like to go out to dinner ? My treat . " <p> He drove her to a small restaurant near her home , a tiny place that she had n't noticed in all the years of driving past it . The food was fair , the company engaging . Afterwards , Amy invited him inside , then with a certain nervous courage to her bedroom , and Jacob stayed through Sunday evening the ready change of clothes in his car seeming like good fortune , nothing more . <p> The sex was pleasant . Jacob had quirky tastes and an intensity , yet he could appear remote and self-involved in the most intimate moments . He seemed appreciative of her body , complimenting her features without forcing his words . If she was n't satiated , at least it was a pleasure to have reentered the carefree world of adults . A lot of tiny fears began to vanish  --  Harry 's weight seemed less ominous  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She found herself looking forward to the weekends and the confidence they brought , and her newfound strength would carry her through a week , and sometimes longer . <p> Jacob had to miss some weekends . Once a month he could visit his children , and since they were on the other side of the state , Amy could understand his absence , always wishing him a good trip . <p> Sometimes he visited on weekday evenings , Harry always thrilled to see the myrtle man . Still dressed in the brown uniform with the nametag , Jacob would sit at the kitchen table , entertaining his audience with stories of work , of myrtles seen and clients left satisfied . <p> Despite her nature , Amy learned about libraries . <p> Jacob tinkered with hers , sometimes into the morning hours , Harry helping as long as exuberance and his mother would allow . " I love these old 9s , " Jacob declared , clucking his tongue in a happy way . " It 's like working on a classic car . " Spare , second-hand components @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compressing its files , and he upgraded the readers , their images brilliant and sharp . " More real than real life , " he boasted . " Do n't you agree , Amy ? " <p> Partly because of her boyfriend 's encouragement , but mostly because she was tired of feeling stupid , Amy decided to master one of the more sophisticated digital design programs . " An imagination , " Jacob called it . With it , she built a city beside a foggy sea , mapping every street , every building , then giving each citizen a recognizable face ; and when Harry was at his father 's , she and Jacob would sit naked before the living room reader , watching her newborn people remove each other 's clothes , then make love without shame or taboos . <p> Amy did eventually fashion digitals of her husband , then dropped them into a variety of Hells . It was a therapeutic exercise , or it was juvenile ; either way , the images of suffering became tiresome , then painful , and she erased all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly at Amy 's insistence , she and Harry went to visit Jacob at his minuscule apartment . The neighborhood was poor . His two rooms were dirty despite some hurried attempts to make them presentable . Pity and revulsion in balance , she entertained the idea of asking Jacob to live with them . They had dated for six months ; did n't it seem like time ? But then she found herself hesitating gazing at the old-fashioned stove , cooking pots set on cooking pots and layers of dust on every flat surface . <p> Sloppiness should n't keep her from offering Jacob her home . But the hesitations persisted . <p> Walking to the car , flanked by the two boys , Amy tried to force herself to bring up living together . But then Harry was asking how it was to share a library with all the other apartments  --  the building had an old second-hand library in the basement  --  and Jacob told him , " It works fine . I just have to remember to protect everything personal . That 's all . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had a private life , or lives , and she knew little about him . His apartment was a census address , little more , and where did Jacob sleep when he was n't with her ? <p> A cold spike of metal was in her belly . <p> Jacob and Harry kept walking , one telling the other , " As soon as I can , I 'm going to become a myrtle man . " <p> Maybe Jacob sensed the change in her . <p> More likely it was a mutual change , both of them aware of their distance and neither willing to mention it . <p> He arrived every weekend for a month , as if proving his devotion , but then missed two weekends in a row , some vague family trouble taking him out of town . Amy called his apartment anyway , leaving a string of well-practiced and unemotional messages . She saw him next on Tuesday , very late and without warning . Jacob did n't mention the messages or his travels . He told her that she looked lovely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leftovers . He was getting ready to break up with her , she believed , which made her more sad than she expected . Yet they went to bed as usual , making love , then resting then making love again . <p> Now we 'll break up , she decided . <p> Except they did n't . At least they did n't in any familiar way . With a thick , slow voice , he told her , " Here 's something funny about myrtles . " <p> " What 's funny ? " <p> He rose up on his elbow , saying " They 're true . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> A long , long stare , then he explained . " I read this once in a physics text . Whenever a particle moves , like an electron . . . well , it moves in every possible direction . At least they think so . " <p> So what ? she thought . <p> " Each time it moves , " he said , " the universe divides in all directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A long pause . " Remember that left-handed earth ? It exists somewhere , and not as zeros and ones . A million million of those earths are scattered across Creation . " A deep sigh . " Now is n't that a wondrous thought ? " <p> Amy was more puzzled than enthralled . <p> " Lives , " said the myrtle man , " divide when they 're given the chance . " <p> " Maybe so , " was the best she could offer ; and eventually , after she was fast asleep , Jacob rose and dressed , then visited the old library before slipping away . <p> Harry discovered the myrtle some weeks later . <p> By then both of them had finished grieving over Jacob 's disappearance , at least outwardly . Amy did n't call him anymore . She did n't like looking at his projected likeness  --  a homely man , was n't he ?  --  and she decided that an explanation was n't necessary . She progressed to where she could be alone and content , steeling herself to the prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy seemed back to normal , if somewhat more quiet than before . His tutor claimed he was studying hard ; his father did n't mention odd moods or behaviors . Then one evening he came to Amy , saying , " He 's still here . " Harry spoke with a mixture of matter-of-factness and happiness , adding , " I can see him and us , too . " <p> She went to look . On the screen in her son 's room was the mirror image of her son playing in a room just like this one , save for tiny details . Harry showed her how to change their viewpoint . When she said , " It 's just your birthday present , " he took her to the other rooms in the fantasy house , the likeness of her kissing the homely likeness of Jacob down in the living room , beneath a projected Monet . <p> Between kisses , they spoke , voices ordinary and the words as forgettable as real life . <p> Harry was sent to bed , forbidden to do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , a rising sense of horror making her sob and groan aloud . <p> The myrtle people made love , then began naming names . <p> " Yvonne , " said the woman . <p> " How about Jennifer ? " said the man . <p> " I like Patricia , " said the woman , giving her belly a meaningful squeeze . " My grandmother 's named Patricia . " <p> It was . But how would Jacob know ? <p> " We 'll name her after your grandmother , " said the man , engulfing her and kissing her until the instant Amy blanked the damned screen . <p> " It 's not a myrtle , " the technician told her . " A true myrtle has to be sent around the Net . This one does n't go anywhere . " <p> " I did n't make it . " <p> " I know . Your old boyfriend did . " <p> Amy looked at the woman standing before her . A gray uniform in place of a brown one , and the different sex . Otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an object of suspicion coping with a frazzled and ignorant client . " Can you get rid of it ? " <p> " I can get rid of anything " was the terse reply . <p> What should she do ? Her silly pots were n't selling and her investment incomes were flat , and she sure as hell could n't call Dan and beg for money now . Not for this . Not if the library needed another purge  --  <p> " But you know , you could get rid of it yourself . I do n't even need to be here . " <p> Amy straightened . " Pardon me ? " <p> The technician pointed to fake brown books on a high shelf . " They 're add-ohs . Good ones . Your boyfriend must have installed them . Their entire capacity is being spent maintaining that simulation , and three different AIs are doing nothing but browsing in your files , getting ideas for stories . " An appreciative nod , then she asked , " Did you have your library serviced sometime recently ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named the dealer . " Was it ? " <p> " I think so . " <p> " So you know Mr. Turnbull , do you ? " <p> Amy willed herself to say nothing , to do nothing . <p> Yet the technician read her face , laughing hard and telling her , " I thought the work looked familiar . " <p> " I 'll sue , " Amy whispered . <p> " Sue who ? You had a personal relationship with the man , and you let him work in here . Am I fight ? " Not waiting for a reply , she said , " Jacob does this to a lot of ladies , dear . " <p> She did n't care if she was the only victim . " I can get rid of it myself . You said that ? " <p> " With a crowbar , if you want . Just unplug your connections up there and give a little jerk . " Then she laughed , saying , " A little jerk for the big jerk . Is n't that perfect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , he charms them . Beds them . Then leaves them with some pretend little world . " An angry sigh , then she added , " Maybe that 's to make amends . Who knows ? " <p> " He said he has an ex-wife and two children . " <p> " Maybe . But I have n't heard about them . " <p> Gazing up at the brown nonbooks , she thought : I can take you down any time I want . <p> Then the woman touched a shoulder , waiting for Amy 's eyes to find hers . " Or if you look at it another way , the jerk 's got fifty ex-wives and maybe a hundred or more kids . I bet that 's the way he sees it . " <p> " I bet so . " <p> She did n't remove the fantasy that day , or the next . For several weeks , Amy went to bed planning to do the chore in the morning , and each morning them was an excuse that presented itself , making it seem as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had an upturn in orders for her pots , an elderly woman wanting to decorate her home with recreations of certain Indian pottery . Then came a sudden inexplicable interest in the fantasy she had built with Jacob 's help , those people in their coastal city having waited too long in stasis . With money from the pots , she bought AIs to help her spin details and biographies . Zeros and ones , she began to realize , were more malleable than any wet clay . <p> Because she knew so much about disappointment and unhappiness , Amy made the city joyful ; and after months of work and growing expertise , she decided to release her project into the Net , its identity incorporated into every willing library , its streets and homes ready to welcome all visitors . <p> With each use  --  by law  --  Amy received a modest sum . <p> She was n't making any fortunes , but there was breathing room even when Dan 's support payments failed to arrive . <p> Jacob 's myrtle  --  she always thought of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was outlawed from watching it . So was Amy , in theory , though there were exceptions on weak days , and strong ones . The false Amy had a daughter , then twin sons . The false Jacob acted too saintly to be real , but the false Harry lost his weight and grew up to resemble neither of his parents , which was surprisingly accurate . <p> She did n't destroy the myrtle . <p> Not contemplative by nature , Amy was slow to understand why . But eventually , after she was remarried and preparing to move away , the answer occurred to her without warning . She thought of Jacob and his odd story about electrons in motion , dividing the universe infinite times . If that was true , then she had saved something that did n't need saving . It existed . A troubling notion , it caused her to sit in the library and stare at the bindings ; and after careful thought and some hardwon inspiration , she realized that lives , infinite or not , needed to be lived as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as close to profound as she ever managed , and partly because of that insight , she took the old-fashioned add-ons and AIs with her each time she moved . She did n't look at their contents . Really , she thought , those lives were n't any of her business . <p> Let them live as they wanted ; that was her policy . <p> Amy lived as she wanted , and when she was n't happy , at least she was confident that happiness would come again . It always did . Wait long enough , she was learning , and everything always came to your door again . <p> <p> By Robert Reed <p> Robert Reed is having quite a year .
