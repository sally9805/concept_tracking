<p> PHILIP MARLOWE call home . <p> The American detective story has come a long way from the days when Raymond Chandler 's famous detective walked the mean streets of Los Angeles . Marlowe and his contemporaries , Sam Spade and Lew Archer , were tough hombres , ready to take a beating or deliver one . They lived by a code of conduct whose only cardinal vice was not doing right by the client . Often as not , they had a gat in one hand and a beautiful blonde in the other . <p> Reading a slew of recent mysteries shows the vast gap between then and now . The heroes of today 's detective stories are as likely to be women as men . Many are not loners ; they have children or significant others , although most still eschew marriage . They do n't drink or smoke often , if ever . And their overriding ethos often seems to be compassion , not toughness . <p> Of course , there are some links between today 's mysteries and yesteryear 's . Most current detective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross MacDonald , are set in a big-city milieu full of crime , vice , and corruption . Today 's private detectives , like their predecessors , may be tempted to leave the straight and narrow , but they seldom do . As in the past , today 's detectives are unflinchingly committed to helping their clients - no matter what the cost . <p> Richard Nehrbass 's Dark of Night ( HarperCollins , 210 pp. , $ 20 ) illustrates both the continuities and changes in American gumshoe tales . The hero of this whodunit set in the City of Angels is Vic Eton , a former police officer turned private eye . His job is to find the missing daughter of a prominent film producer - a task that becomes considerably more complicated after his client is blown up by a car bomb . <p> The tale is told in a first-person voice reminiscent of Chandler or Hammett . One passage , which has Eton describing himself to the prospective client , sounds like pure Marlowe : " My office is a block down Bronson . I 'm on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do or do n't have the time for or do n't want to do . I have a lot of contacts in the industry . I know what I 'm doing . I charge a lot of money . And I get it . " On the other hand , Eton is distinctly un-Marlowe-like in that he is a single dad raising a teenage daughter . <p> " Dark of Night " is an engrossing tale full of authentic Hollywood atmosphere . One of the running jokes in the book , for example , is that everybody - from the secretary to the cop - has a movie script they 're trying to peddle . But , as with many detective writers , Nehrbass falls a little flat on narrative ; there are too many loose ends and unexplained happenings , especially involving the private school attended by the missing girl . <p> A better novel is Joe Gores 's 32 Cadillacs ( Mysterious Press , 338 pp. , $ 18.95 ) . In the tradition of Hammett 's Continental Op , this novel centers around a firm of private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's specialty is auto-repossessions , and , in this deftly written caper , the repo men are matched against a wily ring of Gypsy con-artists who have absconded with 32 Cadillacs from local car dealers . <p> This book is populated by colorful characters whose exploits have the too-good-to-be-true quality of real life . For instance , there are Ken Warren , the DKA op with a severe speech defect , who becomes " the greatest carhawk the world has ever known " by repossessing 17 cars in one historic weekend . On the other side , there 's Rudolph and Yana , the two Romanies vying to become King of the Gypsies ; his specialty is elaborate cons where he poses as a Mafioso , hers is fortunetelling with a profitable twist . <p> " 32 Cadillacs " rushes relentlessly toward its hilarious ending in the cornfields near Steubenville , Iowa , where Gypsies from across the country are gathering to pick their new king . Whoever delivers a 1958 pink Caddy convertible wins the prize - unless , that is , the DKA men get there first . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast , David Berlinski 's A Clean Sweep ( St. Martin 's Press , 230 pp. , $ 17.95 ) - another private-eye tale set in San Francisco - demonstrates some pitfalls of the genre . This book is populated by cliches : Aaron Asherfield is a sarcastic private eye who lives by himself and is afraid of getting involved with women . He gets beaten up a lot and has an antagonistic relationship with the police . Sound familiar ? <p> Berlinski does n't help himself with a plot that 's hard to follow . " A Clean Sweep " focuses on a case that somehow ties together murder and blackmail , drug dealing and money laundering , embezzlement and other white-collar crimes . The author is to be commended for his ambition , but the plot never coheres . The best parts of this work are some of the more bizarre touches - such as the black preacher with a dog he insists is Jewish . <p> Lillian O'Donnell demonstrates that the detective story can have greater range . Her Used to Kill ( G. P. Putnam 's Sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private eye and is set in New York , not on the West Coast . The P.I. , Gwenn Ramadge , is called in to investigate when beautiful young Emma Trent is suspected of bludgeoning her wealthy older husband to death . The affair rapidly degenerates into a media circus , a la the Amy Fisher case . But , flying in the face of press coverage , Ramadge becomes convinced of her client 's innocence and sets out to nail the real culprit . <p> On the face of it , this is familiar enough territory , but O'Donnell skillfully manipulates the plot to keep the reader guessing until almost the end about the culprit 's identity . This book also breaks new ground in police/private-eye relations . Normally , they are depicted as antagonists . But in " Used to Kill , " Ramadge is dating an officer investigating the murder . <p> RONALD TIERNEY 'S The Iron Glove ( St. Martin 's Press , 211 pp. , $ 17.95 ) is also highly unconventional , but not nearly as good as O'Donnell 's book . Set in Indianapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shanahan , who is well past retirement age . The best line of the book comes early when a client tells Deets , " I 'm so glad you are an older man . " He replies , " I wish I could share your enthusiasm , Mrs. Schmidt . " <p> Unfortunately , it 's all downhill from there . The plot revolves around the murder of a United States senator 's wife . A young Hispanic boxer who was friendly with the victim is arrested for the crime , but Deets sets out to show he did n't do it . The plot twists are all either predictable ( the identity of the killer ) or preposterous ( revelations of child abuse ) . Particularly unconvincing is the author 's depiction of Washington politics . He should have stuck to what he knows best - life in the Midwest . <p> And , in turn , the reader in search of a good mystery should stick to " 32 Cadillacs " or " Dark of Night " or " Used to Kill .
