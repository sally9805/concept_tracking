Mariah Advent had never considered herself a practical Christian . She was n't sweet , or charitable , or patient . She did n't cross the road to help her neighbor , or give her coat to a shivering pilgrim , for one of them would still be coatless . She did not turn the other cheek , if by cheek one meant a part of her face . But she had turned the other other cheek frequently in her time . <p> And not a bad set of cheeks , either , to sheathe in a pair of tights , and move proudly in the world among those not blessed with such suppleness . She had turned heads frequently in her time , too . <p> Turned them , and given good measure for their turning when she chose . <p> This morning , though , she sat on the edge of the double bed , feeling the mattress sag slightly , and the collage she had worked on so long crinkle under her . Between the rippled side of the bleached shade and the window frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knobs on the bedstead and gilding a section of the wallpaper : brown roses , a few now sun-flecked , dotting a butternut background . <p> She saw none of this , however , nor the shadow her own body had begun to throw over the golden center of the collage spread behind her . <p> Normally it would have been her day off , Saturday , and she would have spent it meditating , which in the past had meant nothing systematic or programmed according to a religious regimen of any kind , Eastern or Western . Mariah 's meditating day had been composed of keeping her body occupied with various domestic projects so her mind could release itself into the mansions of air denied it during the week . Working salads , and keeping freshly stocked the trays on the long line at the cafeteria , gave her neither time nor energy for her soul 's health , though not log ago , when she began drawing , that had altered significantly . <p> She had taken the job across the street from the shopping center  --  so new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thought the work would afford her a chance to unshackle her meditative life from its Saturday confinement and spread it over the whole week . <p> She had imagined her hands in mountains of lettuce , seeing the droplets of water pop upward as she broke open the clumps of it , revealing the paling green inwards of the smaller leaves hugging themselves . She had felt the almost furry tops of broccoli forests against her fingers , breaking the larger bunches down into little flowers , and the rougher , less-giving brain-mounds of cauliflower . Slicing beets and tomatoes , cucumbers and bell peppers  --  she had always wanted a dress the deep , hypnotic green of a pepper  --  her arms and wrists and hands and fingers engaged with these cool fruits of the earth had seemed to promise her a rote intimacy from which her thoughts could fly into the hidden shapes of her enlightenment . <p> Oddly enough , the job she had left to go to the cafeteria had given her too much time to herself , too many stretches where she had nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio ; a person nowadays had more of it than ever before , because of modern conveniences that cut down the time formerly needed to get the basic chores of a household done . And this was true . Her job as cook and maid at the Randoms 's had been daily proof of it . The dishwasher washed the dishes ; the disposal ground up the kitchen waste so there was little garbage to tote out to the big can in the alley . Even the sheets were presewn to fit snugly around the mattress corners , so smoothing the one bed she had to make was a snap . <p> But it felt wrong . It was as if the center of something had been removed and the outer parts abandoned to an increasingly vacuous whirling , a wheel turning without an axle . Once , sitting in the kitchen while the pressure cooker steamed vegetables and the oven timed a roast , she had imagined a planet lose its axis and go filtering off without control , gradually fraying at the edges , dispersing parts of itself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it spread so thin it disappeared . <p> The experience had excited her at first , seeming to be an instance of the very meditation she sought , but she had also been unsettled  --  even frightened  --  by the particular way her feeling had embodied itself . If this was the direction in which leisure time cast her inner thoughts , she wanted no more of it . In spite of the generous raise old Mr. Random had offered her , and the amiable way he and his sweet wife treated her , she had given two weeks ' notice and filled out an application for the cafeteria opening . <p> How could she explain to Mr. Random that his proposal to rearrange her duties so she have more time for herself would have only made things worse ? As it was , Mrs. Random fried chicken herself because her husband would n't eat anyone else 's . The only time Mariah really enjoyed her six months with the elderly couple was their July Fourth dinner for their relatives . <p> They had come from all over , including as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as two blocks over in Ginter Park where three of the Randoms 's daughters and their one son lived , all within a mile of each other . Mariah had worked for all of them at one time or another , filling in when their help got sick , or lending a hand at parties and local family gatherings , usually on Sundays . They each had children , too , nine altogether , a hodgepodge of grimy , loud energies spinning about interchangeably . <p> Except for one . Mariah remembered how one of the grandsons , Mr. Random 's son 's son  --  Seth was it ? Most of them had funny , one-syllabled names , names with no music in them , so when you said them it sounded like you were whining or barking or coughing : Jane and Hank and Mark-Mark , that was the one . Seth was his father . <p> She had heard old Mr. Random 's standard joke about how hard it was to keep everybody straight anymore , there were so many , and the more who arrived the worse his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family tree as far back as he could dig , but had told him never-mind when he found out an immediate forbear had been a corporal in the Confederate army who had deserted to sell mules to both sides . <p> She remembered how Mark had closed the oven door on her when she was substituting at the son 's house . Hovering around the kitchen like he 'd emerged from the wall or might vanish into it at any minute . Could n't have been more than five or six years old . Not saying anything . Mariah had wondered if he was just interested in what she was doing , which at that moment was baking rolls . <p> " They 're not quite brown enough , " she said , glancing from the rolls to the boy and back . " See ? " <p> He approached and , standing beside her , bent toward the four cast-iron pans , out of which puffed twenty-four nearly lighter-than-air caps of homemade bread . <p> " Are n't they gems ? " Mariah smiled at him . <p> Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy had put both hands under the door and brought it abruptly up as Mariah slid the rack back in the oven , trapping her right arm momentarily in the hot interior . She 'd been unable not to cry out , though she had n't been burned . A little sun of fear and surprise burst in her eyes , seeming to her as if the true location of this widening bud of flame had been inside her forehead  --  and she dropped the hot pad in the stove . The only injury turned out to be a bruise on her forearm where she bumped it when she jerked free of the heat , knocking the oven door open again . It had bounced , she remembered , flapping on its hinges , making a noise like one of the Randoms 's names . <p> The boy disappeared . His mother made a fuss , but even as Mariah was telling her it was nothing , she was retreating toward the bustle of people in the living room , tinkling their glasses in the pre-dinner haze of cigarette smoke and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright blossom in her head , and after that the phrase lend a hand-a favorite of old Mr. Random  --  had acquired an overtone she would have preferred to forget . There had been so much to do for that July-Fourth reunion that she had become engrossed beyond her desire . A week of preparation , and the unending day of the festivities themselves , had freed her deepest flights . She had lost track of time in the rising and widening of vision ; while her hands kneaded dough or chopped scallions or speared cloves into the plump hams , and her body adapted itself to the postures of bending and sidling and lifting , her spirit had found shapes it settled in and abandoned  --  the smell of a flower , or a butterfly lost in a field and suddenly fluttering up , seeming to lift the whole expanse of grass and blossom with its rising . <p> She had flown with a Tuskegee airman , his co-pilot , on a dangerous mission covering a bombing run to central Germany . The silent puffs of exploding anti-aircraft shells  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word that seemed itself an explosion , the sound of an atmosphere  --  interspersed with spurts of fire from the guns of another world she remembered from the newspapers years ago , Messerschmitts , as many consonants clustered as there were bullets spewing from the wings of the plane . In the midst of this turmoil she noticed the pilot had disappeared ; the seat was as empty as a grounded bird 's nest in February . As the plane began to veer and plummet she grabbed the stick , righting it , feeling herself not merely at ease with the controls but drawing from them into her hands and arms the buoyancy of the air , being herself lifted within the little craft she lifted out of the flak and enemy assault toward other explosions  --  bursts of light above her , and then , surrounding her beyond the stratosphere , starwheels and novae and , far off to her looming horizon , the sear-white roil of the sun . <p> She had stood in the crowd carpeting the ground in front of the Lincoln Memorial . Martin Luther King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream , too , her mind replied . She watched the afternoon brightness bank off the white marble of the monument , a sheet of paper peeling from a ream , riding the air , a background against which King 's tilting , passionate head took on the dark glow of glory . <p> She had joined the men in Julian Binford 's The Crapshooter , watching the dice describe their crazy jigging across the blue plane that was supposed to be the solid surface she tossed the dice on , but appeared a receptive opacity , a pool of aquamarine opalescence , a sky . She had finally fallen into it , or through it into something else . Though she had pitched forward , following her arm as if the dice she released had pulled her by invisible threads attached to her fingers , once she passed into the mysterious skypool she had fallen upward , rising through the cloudlike softness toward a shimmering coalescence of light above her . <p> She had stood in a battle line , one of thousands of soldiers in blue and gray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy amassed a charge against her position , roaring over the ridge line and descending upon her . She raised her musket . Sighting down it , she saw the faces of those looming up toward her cluster , as if to become a better target , drawing together into a flower for her to fire on . She pulled the trigger and the faces ignited from the center of the corona they composed , the flames flaring outward , consuming them wholly . <p> As her visions faded , she would for an instant watch the gesture in the midst of which she had caught her body , to which in a palpable sense she was returning : seeing her arms spangled with suds from the dishpan they drew a saucer from , or feeling her shoulders tense with the effort of extracting a stack of plates from the lower reaches of the sideboard , or smelling the rich pecans and Karo in the pies she carried to the card tables on the porch . <p> She quickly discovered that the imperial routines at the cafeteria were no family reunion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving  --  in this case , keeping the self-service trays and cylinders abundant and appealing  --  fruits and vegetables , and , she learned , ham and American cheese and diced turkey , not to mention Jell-O and nut and-cream-cheese concoctions named after exotic Pacific islands ( salad had swollen to embrace a multitude of ingredients ) : those fantasies had proven accurate . But she had not had even the gentlest grazing of vision beckon her . The sameness of her duties numbed her before the first week ended . She dragged herself into bed that Friday , too tired to sleep , a zombie in her white uniform with the red rooster on its breast pocket . She stared at the ceiling . Darkness collected , and soon passing cars flipped their lights from wall to wall . <p> She missed the old couple . She realized what she wished for was some compromise between the undemanding , lapse-dotted days she had spent with them , and the unrelenting and unvarying pressure at the cafeteria . That Fourth of July had been an aberration , an islanded gift to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the wide sea of daily life , she knew , seldom offered such landfall . <p> She began to read the classifieds every day during her thirty-minute lunch " hour , " and to watch for posters and other ads in the store windows she passed walking home . <p> Today , ten weeks after starting her search for another job , she was still at it ; at first in desperation and then in a kind of resignation that had a hopeful feel about it , like the kernel inside a peach seed , she had developed a ritual for her day off . It was a ritual in outline only , however . She planned to be busy , to engage her body 's attention , but beyond that to proscribe nothing . No Saturday , beyond the broad command of physical occupation , would be like another . The exact activities , and their progression , would unfold spontaneously , a living dream with its own logic , one piece connected to the next as surely as a hook into an eye , but without conscious preconception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor hunched toward the wide baseboard in her bedroom , picking paint from the grooves lining its crown . She had removed all the paint she could with chemical stripper from the hardware store in the shopping center . It had taken five gallons for the small room , two less than there were coats of paint : on the old wood . The only way to get the final dots and slivers that had found niches in the wood to settle in was to gouge them out with the point of a paring knife . Or her ice pick . <p> It was perfect work . What had at first seemed a disadvantage  --  stiffness in her back when she bent to do her miniature mining  --  turned into a boon . She figured out various reclining positions in which she could pick comfortably , and imagined , or felt , as the morning extended itself , that each change of posture was part of a slow , choreographed routine she was performing . She moved clockwise . To her left along the edge of the baseboard little flecks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her like cosmic dust in a starfall . <p> In the midst of a like trail of associations in her mind she had remembered Serena Peoples in the vegetable aisle of the Safeway , telling her about the big house where she did cleaning . More rooms than your heavenly mansion itself , she had told Mariah . Even the rooms have rooms , like they reproduce in the dark . Mariah had laughed with Serena at this , but uneasily , for the image of procreating darkness was familiar to her from the edges of some of her visions , and she always turned away from it , though at times it meant a withdrawal from her transport : <p> Serena had said her employers had names for all those rooms . Some after colors-the blue room and like that  --  and some after their children , only one of whom-there were six-still lived in the palace , as she referred to it . Others had names of battles from The War  --  Serena came down icily on the two syllables ; she could n't pronounce those and wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he had commenced a lecture that went on and on . <p> Mariah had begun to have a similar reaction to Serena 's lengthening list , and had almost tuned her into the rhythms of the sentences and out of their words , when Serena said drawing room . It was nothing to her but another stage in her story , but it struck Mariah . She had paused in her selection of red potatoes , as if to store this phrase securely for future access when she had the appropriate context for it . <p> That context occurred  --  though Mariah had forgotten the train of thought that had chugged into the station  --  as she was lost in dislodging paint the following Saturday . <p> Her hand had stopped , the ice pick poised above a little well of dead yellow , much as her hand had hovered over the potato bin . It was her turn of mind to see what words described  --  to take them literally  --  and to entertain , usually with delight , the layers of meaning phrases often carried with them unintentionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  would lead her into more thorny places . She had been undone for a week once by having to untangle all your waking life . <p> Drawing room , however , occasioned first a childlike enjoyment . She imagined a cartoon in which a room , equipped with arms and legs , was able to draw . It created fish for ponds and sea gulls for beaches , trees for girls to climb and swings for boys to swing in . It even drew a large , beautifully appointed room for itself to live in , furnished with a draftsman 's table for it to draw on  --  another drawing room . <p> Having reached that point she let the first depiction fade , and saw herself in the drawing room , the room to draw in ( to withdraw to ) , standing before the table with a long feathered pen in her hand , is sharp point hovering above a brilliantly blank expanse of paper . <p> The pen faded , too , as it descended , Mariah 's conscious attention returning to the ice pick , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint . <p> As she dug gently , she had decided to make herself a drawing room . It would n't be a room , of course . She had only two , plus the kitchenette and bathroom . She would rearrange the bedroom  --  put the bed jam  --  up against the far wall , move the table into the sitting room , hang a gooseneck light over the headboard  --  and create a space to draw next to the window . <p> Even before she had agreed with herself about this adjustment , she had realized she did n't have to limit herself to drawing . About this time , too , she had had a vision different in its overall feel and tonality from those she was accustomed to . She thought of it more as a dream , for it had come at night as she lay in bed , doing nothing . She had thought she was asleep at first , but . the experience had a waking dimension that made her doubt her precise relationship to it . It was brief , hardly more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were etched on her eyeballs . She saw a set of concentric rings , becoming brighter as they approached the smallest zero at the center , which was where she was . She as the center , the bull's-eye of this target of gathering brilliance . That was all . Except she knew the archer about to release his arrow of light was Jesus , and he was aiming at her . <p> Over the succeeding four weeks two dimensions of her life noticeably altered . <p> All the spaces in her apartment opened to her new pursuit ; the apartment itself became a drawing room . Whenever she cooked she had to remove from the stove a set of drying brushes , or trays starred with cracked , unused watercolors . Before she could flop on the bed after a day at the cafeteria she spent a few minutes laying in the corner next to the closet the scraps of paper she had pieced out on the spread that morning , to test color or shape combinations . Paper of various sizes and hues draped over her sagging couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ate off of . Pencils , brushes and drawing markers , pairs of scissors and artists ' knives , littered the floors . She did her experimenting and practicing wherever she took a notion to . <p> The one neat spot was the corner next to the window in the bedroom , the original drawing room . Its focal object was the table Mariah had rigged to work on . She had found two identical end tables at the junk shop around the corner . Twoballs the store was called , as was its owner  --  an obese man whose pudgy little fingers had played on Mariah 's arms and shoulders and back like she was a piccolo  --  because the pawnshop emblem hanging over its recessed doorway lacked a third of the usual equipment . By the time Mariah got out of there , the leering proprietor holding the screen for her , she was sure the designation advertised a personal service as well . <p> She stacked one end table on the other , and on top of them she angled a piece of plyboard , four feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-inch blocks and the edge turned toward the wall on five-inch ones . These blocks she had first nailed to the top of the second end table . Finding the upper table had a tendency to slide , she had fastened an L-brace to each leg and anchored them to the top of the lower table . <p> She kept the table dusted , and ran the carpet sweeper in the corner late every evening . The drawing  --  she adopted the generic term for all her projects  --  she was focused on at any particular time lay on the slanting board ; the supplies she anticipated needing she arranged in rows on the top of the undertable , as she called it . She thought of the two tables in various ways  --  as the undertow and the waves , or the viscera and the mind , or the undersoul and the oversoul  --  all determined by their vertical relationship . She saw herself sometimes in a medieval tower , sometimes at the top of a skyscraper , sometimes on a mountainous crag . Accompanying all these aspiring images  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense that the structure she worked with had become a person , an identity standing before her , its absolute stillness both a dependence and an offering drawing her outward and deepening her at once . <p> Time was the other dimension she had reconstructed . The hours she had spent buying equipment , and setting up the drawing table , had disconcerted her . The activity had delayed the moment she could settle in and begin making the pictures and assemblages which had unconsciously stirred as soon as Serena Peoples had uttered the fateful Sesame . As much as Mariah enjoyed the little art shop next to the hardware store , buying brushes and special pencils she never knew existed before her need for them , she was impatient with the practical requirements it represented . She learned here , too , the word  --  collage  --  for plans that already roiled in her mind , and she found , under pressure from both her purse and her imagination , that she did n't have to buy most of what she envisioned as pieces in her compositions . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shopping center , planning to use the reverse sides , but discovering as she worked that fragments of words and designs sometimes suited her purpose , too . Other employees at the caf ( a short , hard word she liked because it was pronounced like a baby cow ) brought her scraps of wrapping paper and leftover sewing material ; one of the women who prepared entrees , a sullen , whiplike person who never spoke to anyone , brought her a stack of actual watercolor pads she said her daughter would never use . Serena had swiped two shining X-Acto knives and a set of blades from a palace tool room no one ever entered . <p> All of this occupied time , but it was Mariah 's actual work that transformed it . <p> Perhaps her release from unfelt pressure to have her visions while she was at the cafeteria caused the change ; perhaps the daily anticipation of her life outside the salad division ; or the removal of the barrier between physical and visionary energy : whatever the cause , her hours at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rhythms of the work and her developing rapport with some of the other employees . <p> She came home as fresh as if she 'd just awakened from the rejuvenating sleep of a fairy tale . She ate her chicken or ham sandwich , holding a glass of milk in the other hand , moving from bedroom to living room to kitchen , surveying the scraps and partial assemblages spread about like wildflowers in a meadow . Some evenings she would get no farther than this ambulatory rumination , adjusting a piece of one grouping or adding color to the edge of an abstract scene daubed on the back of a poster . Other days brought heightened intensity to the central project atop the oversoul . Whatever her focus , she worked regardless of time , a presence moving among her material as if it were pieces of herself she was drawing together into a transcendent singularity . <p> Over the next couple of months she felt she had accomplished this frequently . A round dozen collages-ranging in size from three feet by five feet to six by six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a growing environment . The irony of having to continue  --  of going on to another collage after she had seemed to assemble and garner the heart of illumination in the one she had just finished  --  was n't lost on her . She spent Saturdays cleaning the apartment , absorbed in domestic chores , collecting the plates and glasses from the floor and chair arms and the side of the tub , making the rest of the place look as good as the drawing room always did , and drawing back from herself to consider where she was in her quest . She sensed that not knowing what she sought was an indispensable dimension of the search itself , and rather than being troubled or frustrated by this she was energized instead . <p> Two weeks before , scrubbing the bathroom floor , drawing the brush in rhythmic arcs across the small black-and-white tiles , feeling the suds tingle as they evaporated on the left hand and forearm which bore her leaning weight , her neck and shoulders rolling gently with the brush , she had had a breakthrough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not once but twelve times , the repeated crucifixions making a circle on the crest of a hill . She always imagined Jesus as having skin the same light brown as her own , with an undertone tending vaguely toward olive , but this Jesus , all twelve of him , was stark black , with the deepest possible blue glowing from within . His head hung to the right , as if it wanted to nestle against his own shoulder . Though they never actually moved , his eyes were closing , in spire of the rigid , two-inch strands of wire stuck vertically through them into his cheekbones . The cast of the whole man was sorrowful ; he was pulled toward the earth , not as if gravity wanted to drag him of the cross but as if he were being drawn through it , or merged with it , into one being . <p> Mariah 's body , on all fours except for the arm wielding the brush , had begun to sway and dip , and little moans escaped her lips , parted as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision split into two perspectives : she watched simultaneously from above , seeing the circle composed by the twelve kinky-haired heads of Jesus atop their severely foreshortened bodies , and from a vantage an inch from the eyes of one Jesus , although she knew the eyes of the others burned with the same fury , making a white speck in their deepest centers . <p> These two perspectives merged slowly as the circle tightened , gradually becoming a black dot  --  one head coalesced from twelve  --  which superimposed itself over the burning core of the eye of Christ . The aura of the fire around the compressed black dot looked like an eclipse of the sun for an instant , and then the depth of the white heat consumed the black coal and a brilliance beyond relief or forbearance spread to the edges and plunged to the bottom of Mariah 's vision . <p> She uttered an O , her secret and revelation , no louder or more forceful than the series of moans which had preceded it , and her body , without twitch or seizure , rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its bristles against the tile . <p> When she woke she gathered herself and sat on the lip of the tub . She brushed the right side of her work dress , damp from the floor . She rubbed her forehead ; she made little circles with her fingers against her temples . Then she eased herself back to the tiles , dipped the brush in the bucket and began scrubbing again . <p> She brought two discoveries from the vision . She would change he basic shape of her collage backing from the rectangle to the circle . And the controlling image she sought would become a blossom of fire . <p> This shift proved to be more difficult than she expected . In fact , as she removed the rectangular collages from the walls and disassembled them , salvaging everything including the anchor joints where four or five layers of material had been spot-glued over each other , she expected no difficulty at all . It was a matter of knowing better what she was doing , a sharper fix on purpose and design , a deeper connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . <p> What surprised her  --  unsettled her in the same way he images of darkness multiplying itself had-was the sudden recurrence of sexual memories from the part of her life she had thought was over . The drawing room had led her , she thought ruefully , to the dark room . She knew she would have to unpin the prints hanging from the strings there , to look at the frozen images by the light of day . <p> At first only isolated scenes intruded : a sweaty man on a bed watching her peel off her underwear in the glow from a dim red light ; standing above a cluster of crapshooters , feeling their frank glances crawling up the miniskirt she taunted them with , knees apart ; smoking a cigarette , alone at a table in some ramshackle roadhouse at three A.M. , not even the drunk piano player outlasting her . <p> The lurid quality of these disjunct images stunned her . She had cast herself in bad movie roles  --  stereotypes  --  as a way of reducing herself ; she knew the harshness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things she had done , but that knowledge wavered like a mirage in the desert when she realized , as well , she had no access to what had really happened except through the screen of judgment . <p> The pride she had taken in her body and its spontaneous skills , the pleasure that had spilled her so often over the edge , the wide , nitty-gritty , slow-motion fall into sparkle , the miracle of friction issuing in silk  --  all this was confused and diminished , skewed by disgust and repulsion . She had no way of telling if she had suppressed this sense of crassness and thinned humanity during those abandoned years , or if she had unconsciously developed the perspective in the time since , a filter through which she projected her memories . <p> In a few days , the frequency and extension of such scenes multiplied . No coherence connected them other than Mariah 's self-laceration ; no person appeared more than once to give her a figure on which to shift her burden , to ease her blame by sharing it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual experience itself , as if each specific memory were a stroke in her , deeper and swifter and more lubricious , the sequence stimulating her toward some final focus that would explode and release like orgasm . <p> Even in the growing anticipation of this , she admitted to herself  --  more by accretion than by sudden understanding  --  that , for all their sweetness and elation , sometimes brutal , her orgasms had never transported her in the same way her friends recounted theirs . Giving them the leeway of hyperbole , of their need for self-elevation , Mariah never felt she quite apprehended the ecstasy they described . Without their standard to measure against , she suspected she would still feel a vague disorientation , as if while walking on a path which appeared clear before her , she had snagged her skirt on a thorn . <p> And there had always been that distance in which she had watched herself , a bird on a wire . Until someone had told her how she just shot loose of the universe , fell apart in the stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought being a spectator at her own coming was a normal part of the experience . After a while she concluded that , for her , it was . For all her friends ' wild fables of melting into the deep lava  --  which she neither believed nor disbelieved , but loved for the rich appeal of their speech  --  she made no effort to change her way of drawing the groove to a climax . <p> So she was not surprised when the insistence of her memories began to fade , their frequency to diminish , the process reversing itself until , after a few days of random disruptions similar to the cinematic blips the whole series had started with , they disappeared altogether . <p> She realized that this two-week rush of memory recapitulated the course the years of her sexual life had followed . She had begun by experimenting , moved more by curiosity than lust  --  though she knew that beneath every stage of every entanglement she was searching for someone to love her wholly , to whom she would give herself without stint  --  and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing the fine and deadly edges of all its illusory rapture . Then she withdrew . There had been no addiction . The bird on the wire called its image back into itself and flew away . <p> The ease with which Mariah had extracted herself was not matched , however , by those people from whom she walked away . Men sought her out , strangers and castoffs alike , taking her explanations and denials  --  which grew more terse and rankling with the passing weeks and months  --  as just new routines of seduction and foreplay . They understood her various forms of refusal as merely covering her willingness , her yearning , much as they saw their limp foreskins as a momentary disguise over the hard proof of desire that always emerged from them . <p> She had cut most of that off finally by moving to the neighborhood she currently lived in , though it was shrinking , the result of urban " improvement . " The shopping center where she worked sprawled over land where many of her acquaintances once carried on their lives . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheedling and cursing had begun to die off  --  her reputation becoming a legend as separate from her as a discarded dress  --  she had to fend off an occasional pass . <p> During the period of her memories ' disruption she had accomplished very little with her art , but when it was over she renewed her daily immersion ; it was not that she came again to her new vision as if nothing had happened , but as if she had brought decision into what had been an accidental phase of her life . The sequence of memories struck her now as an invitation to re-enter what she had passed through , to take up a way of living she had drifted into and out of . She had endured the compressed version of her past with impatience , feeling intruded upon by another person , and had with relief and gladness repudiated it . The release she enjoyed was enhanced by her rejection of the tawdry judgment the memories had come wrapped in . She knew that whatever had caused that perspective was as dead now as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once she started to draw and cut and shape again , further changes , fundamental as they were , went unnoticed . <p> She began to forget to change the sunflower seeds or the breadsticks at work , or someone would have to remind her to eat her lunch ( which some days she neglected to pack , meaning she had to eat caf food ) , or an odd color or shape on the tray line would suddenly register on her eye and she would turn to find she 'd put out two bins of lettuce and omitted something else . Two Fridays she missed dates for supper with Serena , not realizing it either time until Serena dropped by later to see if she was sick . <p> At home she would perform her Saturday-morning rounds of the apartment  --  now a studio  --  and find no dishes to wash , or at best a plate or two whose surfaces the mice had polished so thoroughly she put them back on the shelf . <p> These incidental ticks were signs of a more fundamental shift . Her old way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread sensual contentment through her body , as preparing vegetables did  --  for the visions that promised her spiritual fulfillment , underwent a reversal . After she witnessed Jesus draw himself twelvefold into a coal , which he then consumed in the fire of his own eye , she lived in and for her visions . She let the exterior world fade , paying no attention to the messages of its former appeal which her senses still tried to relay to her . <p> She did notice , but only barely , as one notices the presence of an insect in the next room , that her eyesight was deteriorating . She developed small shimmers of opacity , a kind of beige glare , in the centers of both eyes , which she had to look around in order to gauge color and shape for her collages . She would cock her head , resembling a robin searching the ground , and view everything from her periphery . <p> Her visions changed , too , or their lacations did . They did n't come to her now , as visitations entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her , and sought instead to be released and given exterior shapes . No , not shapes , but a shape , a single incarnation encompassing the intractable extremes of darkness and brilliance , of compression and release , of depth and height , that she had become part of that Saturday as she lay moaning gently on the bathroom tiles . <p> So she roved her studio , an extension in all directions of the focus of her central assemblage , itself moved to the bed since the surface of the makeshift double table was no longer big enough for the scale on which Mariah engaged her conception . The edges of the circular backing spilled over the bed , which she had pulled away from the walls , rising slightly over the head and foot boards This was the foundation piece , burgundy poster board she had glued together , whose darkness she had deepened and thickened with repeated washes of Prussian blue and forest green , eventually applying the paint in thick blobs she spread about with a kitchen knife . Unadulterated colors no longer satisfied her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her head tilting from side to side , often in the early mornings . One day a city trash truck blared its klaxons at her . She raised herself from the stack of flattened brassiere cartons she had been bowed to and found herself surrounded by noon : she was supposed to be at the cafeteria . <p> A panel of velvet black covering for ad boards gave her the final dimension of richness she needed for the backing circle  --  the sphere of heads and one head , the farthest cup of the galaxies , the deepest cave of the earth . She spent a week on the living-room floor cutting the material into minutely narrow strips which she carried one by one , like offerings , into the bedroom and embedded into the miniature ranges of paint that had given the burgundy paperboard the appearance of a relief map Looking at the result as a dawn filtered through her bedroom window , she saw its light fall effortlessly forever into the subtle gradations of midnight she had blended , seeming at once to be absorbed into an immeasurable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another month and she had almost achieved the eye-sun , a concatenation of shreds of cotton and aluminum wound inextricably together in a frayed circle concentric with , and glued to , the darkness surrounding it . Over this tangle of strips and coils and spirals she trickled gold house paint from two quart cans she had had mixed at the hardware store , the same day she 'd gotten the tin snips for the aluminum scraps . The boy who had waited on her had kept his distance and spoken deliberately , as if he thought she was an alien child , or deranged , a madwoman who might go berserk suddenly if he made the wrong move . <p> She had n't blamed him for this once she looked at : herself in the bathroom mirror when she got home . Her dress , with its speckles of paint and little bits of scrap paper stuck randomly about , resembled one of her early collages . Above it , her face repeated the impression , more flamboyantly because of the smears of paint on her cheeks and forehead where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straggling hair aside , or trying somehow to wipe away the blind spots in her eyes . By now the spots had enlarged so much she had to aim her head at the corner of the bathroom , forcing herself to focus there , before she could see her face , poorly , in the mirror . <p> " Clown , " she said aloud . " Nothing but a clown . " <p> But her eyes burned with another name . She felt it stall in her chest before it could rise and form a growl in her throat . The precise expression evaded her , but when she gave into the muscular pressure of years of habit and looked directly at her reflection , it seemed for an instant she had set the beige opacities into two wells of molten flame . <p> She went back to her art as if she 'd seen nothing . <p> She spent a sleepless night on the floor beside the bed , while the gold paint she had dripped on the central tangle of aluminum and cloth dried . It formed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power lines into the gaps between the thin coils of metal . When she had fitted the top of the can into its paint-clogged groove she had thought she was finished , but something nagged at her and pushed her away , alternately making her want to stare a hole through this hodgepodge in her skewed way , and to turn her back on it and never look at it again . <p> Laboriously she shoved the bed farther from both walls so she could walk around it more easily , looking at her creation from every degree of its horizon . <p> She mixed a cup of cobalt-blue watercolor and with her smallest brush flipped specks of it on the sun-eye . She sprinkled a deeper metallic blue glitter on that , and then spent hours blowing it into different configurations until most of it disappeared in the maze . Light-headed , she sat on the chair by the deserted table , leaning her cheek against one of the upper legs . <p> She stared into the corner beyond the bed . She thought of nothing . She longed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw herself serving drumsticks to hordes of picnicking children , their hands fluttering before her like finches , She saw Serena waltzing in her palace ballroom . Martin Luther King saluted her from the cockpit of his P-51 . She blew him a kiss , told him she was sorry but she had to go down in the mine . The face of an anonymous lover flickered on and off like a neon sign , black light . She saw nothing . <p> When she finally closed her eyes she realized what was wrong , why she had drawn herself so near to completion but had driven herself with equal force away from her gift . <p> Of course . <p> So simple . <p> She had reversed the dark and light . The coal at the center of her vision and Christ 's eye had become in her collage the surrounding , multilayered darkness . Her fire , instead of consuming , was about to be swallowed up . <p> Quick . <p> She got out of the chair , slumped externally , and borne so deeply into herself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more step between her and the newly shifted bed she would have crumpled to the floor . As it was she fell into the collage , curling with her last energy around its center , feeling nothing , not even the pain in the part of her side that crushed some of the sharp-edged tines of the aluminum . <p> A few days later Serena Peoples would open the unlocked door of Mariah 's apartment and find her sitting on the side of the bed , her head tilted toward her shoulder , staring at the bare window , sightless , one side of her mottled dress torn slightly and stained more deeply than the rest , the huge collage behind her bearing the rumpled imprint of her body , her shadow obscuring the cracked sunburst from which she seemed to have risen . <p>
