Men stopped taking care of women in 1979-in the winter . But at the time , I did n't know a thing about it . I was going so fast that winter you 'd think I would have humped it like a speed bump , hit my head on the felt headliner of my car , felt it-the precise secondwhen they let us go . Do you know that dream where you put both feet on the brakes but the brakes and your will fail all the way to the floorboard ? The one where the car speeds up to happier and more terrifying speeds until it zooms unbraked into the sky ? <p> That November I volunteered to drive our first mate , Whitey , and his throat cancer from an oil dock in Houma , Louisiana to the VA Hospital in Corpus . We took my pink car . We took the farm roads and the coast roads because my inspection sticker had expired . We drove under low freezing clouds the color of an aluminum car port roof with the windows rolled mostly down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county , Whitey would rear from sleep , yelling down down while banging on the passenger window . Like the LeMans was a submarine . Whitey thought cold air slowed the growth of things like St. Augustine yard grass and , perhaps , cancer . <p> My legs were cold the whole way . Maybe it was cancer ; maybe not . En route , the shamed , averted gaze of bartenders and cashiers who refused to cash his checks seemed to confirm the diagnosis . ( Whitey had never tried cashing checks in such a sympathetic condition ; he could n't resist . ) I had to ration him to no more than one beer joint or convenience store for every twenty miles . The thing on his neck was the size of a softball . He spent most of the trip asleep in the formerly white bucket seat beside me , his head vibrating on the doorjamb for a pillow , his Brylcremed curls unfurling in the wind , as if his hair was trying to flag down some help . <p> We came into south Texas doing 8o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " My car used to be that color , " I yelled . For something to say . <p> The radials parted a sea of winter milo-beady headed , a cherry crimson to the pale sky . A hundred thousand acres of gently nodding recrimination : the year before when my husband gave me the car it had been that exact shade of crimson . Sometimes I missed him . <p> " You turned on the goddamn heater , " Whitey said . He banged on the dashboard vents in the manner of Ray Charles . <p> " Did n't , " I said . Only those vents pointed at our feet . <p> But shortly after my husband gave me the car , I had fallen in love with Broussard . A coon-ass boat captain with an eighth-grade education and dark , shoulder-length , curly hair . I spent a year driving back and forth between my husband in Houston and every oil dock on the coast . I needed to be with Broussard so much that one of the many times I left my husband , I wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't take the time to find a ballpoint pen . And , sometimes , on my way to the coast , I would try to turn the car around , just to see if I could-but the steering wheel balked in my hands with an uncanny resistance . After I went to work cooking on the boat , my husband was sweet about forwarding letters and catalogues . But I was so in love , I believed I was exempt from reading my mail . Whatever came into my hands , if it did n't have Broussard written all over it , I tossed it into the back seat . At high speeds , pleading letters from my mother and L. L. Bean catalogues flapped around my head , heavy as pelicans . <p> Pretty soon , there was a lot back there : unpaid phone bills , letters from my husband , department store charge account bills , parking tickets , invitations to my cousin 's graduation . Moral debts , spiritual obligations . Copies of the New York Review of Books and empty packs of Nacho Cheese-Flavored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , advertisements , bank statements , a paperback Chretien de Troyes , a spectator pump , books , a hat box full of Wedgwood , maps . <p> The spring before , one midnight looking for Broussard , I had turned off at what I thought was the road to the P &F; Oil Dock . But it was n't a road , it was a bayou . I turned off the radio and a frog-punctuated silence echoed back to me . My feet were in a puddle . My floorboard started filling up like a bathtub , my car antenna was going down gallantly in a stand of cattails . It was actually rather peaceful . The first time in months that I stopped obsessing about either Broussard or my husband . It was a mini-vacation in a sinking car . <p> Happily , a workboat passing in the bayou threw her spotlight and , then , her chains on me . The next morning she pulled me out of the mud with a big loud Thwop ! After that , the windows would roll neither up nor down ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in the door , muddy and reluctant . <p> Whenever we took a deckhand into town to help with the groceries , the kid always said the same thing . <p> " Hey , you know there 's some mud and stuff back here ? " <p> Then , he would push over this Pompeii that was my life and get in back while in the front seat , Broussard would sigh with a regretful , worldly , sadness . He 'd turn his head ( he kept those slightly graying curls in place with Spraynet ) and say to the deckhand , This used to be a cherry Pon-y-ack . A refinery on the bayou where she went in must have been flushing hydrochloric acid ; the car was revised to a pale Pepto-Bismol pink . Cherry cherry ponyack . Broussard mourned that car . <p> " That 's not one of your colors , " Birdie said about the new shade of pink . Birdie was Whitey 's sometime girlfriend , a color consultant , and someone to question about Broussard . Before we drove away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't worry about me , Bub . I 'm not dyin ' in some pink car . " <p> Sometimes , though , he was very , very still . Well , he could be dead , I 'd think . He tended , of course , not to be dead . <p> But he would fall asleep with his hand frozen to the gear shift knob as if he were driving the car . I did n't have anything else to read but his tattoo . Herman Doerr Herman Doerr . Written in a red heart , surrounded by blue flowers , a banner . If I wanted to shift gears , a little minuet was required . I inserted my hand gently and with a flourish under Whitey's-or tried to . But even in sleep , sensing that somebody wanted something he had his hand on , his grip tightened . I wondered if this was bad for the car . We sometimes drove through whole counties in third gear . <p> In point of fact , though , the tattoo neither peeled nor shed . ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rest of Whitey did . Big chest , no hips , little nearly dainty feet , he wore immaculate white Jockey T-shirts stretched taut and making his stomach look , well , upholstered . But above and below the snow white binding were Whitey 's neck and face and arms and hands . They were baked to a pink-white doneness , and they shed . It was this shedding , or peeling , that got to people the most . <p> In barrooms , sitting next to you , Whitey used his beer coaster to bulldoze the flakes that accumulated on the bar around him into tiny sand dunes . Fascinated , you might enquire about his tattoo . <p> " D'stroyer I was on durin ' the war , " he would say . Then , fast as a flash of Spanish mackerel he was out the door-maybe with your car keys if you had gotten confused . <p> It was good that the windows did n't roll up . It would have been like being trapped inside one of those glass snowstorm paperweights for 674 miles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer sticking out of his neck , we 'd been tied up to a Penrod semi-submersible rig for three weeks . Broussard had spent the down time on his macrame projects . Hammocks , tablecloths , potted plant holders-he was working on a potted plant holder that he said was for his mother but that I hoped was meant for me . He had taken the wheelhouse as his studio ; it looked like someone was drying spaghetti up there . I went up to tell him supper was ready . Through the wraparound wheelhouse windows , the giant legs of the rig looked macramed in steel . <p> Below , the crew had washed up . This meant that they put on shirts or parts of shirts . Broussard insisted upon shirts . Some of them had slicked back their hair with water-it would dry and be sticking out all over their heads by the time Broussard leaned back for his first cigarette . It was like eating dinner with porcupines . <p> We ate in quiet , the crew members like Dobermans keeping their eyes on the drainboard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meat and three vegetables and two salads and , perhaps , two kinds of pie or banana pudding , rolls and maybe a gumbo or an etouffee instead of meat and always rice and white or red beans with every meal . When the first deckhand got up to put his plate in the sink for me , Broussard waved him back down . He told the boys to hold on to their plates . I had decided as a nicety , as a project of my own , to introduce the crew to the concept of The Second Course . Broussard , being French , liked the idea . I stuffed a dozen mirlitons that morning and baked them all day at five hundred degrees . A mirliton is a squash that thinks it 's a rock . Part of the reason to introduce the second course on this particular evening was that the mirlitons were n't done when everything else was ready . The crew did as they were told . It even stirred up a little conversation : <p> " Is this a second course pie ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's like when they have that buffet . " <p> They held their plates up in the air in a way that reminded me of Oliver Twist . I went to the oven and pulled out the baker 's tray of mirlotons , and carried it back over to the counter . So , I was the first to actually see Whitey , but we all heard him at the same time . <p> A soft , all but imperceptible , tragic , cough . The deckhands who had plates and cutlery in their hands heard it together , turned their several spiky heads as one , looking like the percussion section of some orchestra with a lenient dress code . When Whitey felt their attention , warm like a spotlight upon him , he almost swooned . A kid rose to help him but Broussard who was looking , I thought , more sick than Whitey , glared the kid back down . In the same moment , Whitey began to move , crabwise and with difficulty . As he sidled over , I had the impression that Whitey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere on the earth . Everything else had stopped . The crew 's forks were arrested in mid-air . Broussard , my prince , appeared not to be breathing and was staring into some void . At our backs , of course , was a drilling rig with a generator loud and powerful enough to maintain downtown Lafayette-it appeared to have simply shut off . Whitey took a step forward , brought the back foot up , took a step sideways , moved the trailing foot in-we were focused on his little , nearly dainty feet . <p> It took him two years to get to the galley bench and slide into his usual place beside Broussard . <p> " Hey Bub can I talk to you ? We-uh-gotta talk , " he said this close up to Broussard 's ear , although we all heard him . <p> I was over by the stove , having decided that the mirliton pears did n't have a future . I was scraping them off the big sheet baking tray with a black rubber spatula into a garbage bag . The crew had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bean grease smeared plates like they were looking into shaving mirrors . A few tenderly examined their own throats with their fingers . Broussard lit a Pall Mall , flipped the top back on his Zippo , then cracked . <p> " DO N'T POKE THAT THING AT ME . " <p> Broussard bolted , screeching his chair against the linoleum , and disappeared up the wheelhouse stairs . The deckhands skittered out behind like waterbugs-stopping only long enough to throw their plates like sticky Frisbees into the sink . I was left alone with Whitey . <p> " Do you want anything to eat ? " I asked him . <p> " Cai n't babe , " he rasped , pointing to the thing , " I got this cancer . " <p> The next morning , we loaded him into my car-like he was a piece of equipment , a mud pump , an air compressor . ( Broussard could park a 330 ton boat like other people could park a car made in Japan ) . He walked the long flat deck up even with a pier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard . Whitey appeared , a dark blue Coast Guard blanket wrapped around him , holding it at the hem . It trailed on the deck . He looked like a prize fighter coming into the ring-one who was about to change his mind . He lowered himself into the bucket seat beside me . <p> Broussard slammed his door and growled something to Whitey . Then , Broussard came around to my side . His step was actually on the light side . He was relieved . Broussard thought Whitey had conned me . Certainly , the night before in the galley as Whitey called me " babe " for the first time ever I could see the fins in the water , the con sleek and cruising my way . But the truth was that I had already decided to take him to the hospital . I wanted to . Everybody else freaked out when he came into the galley , but I became lucid , calm . I knew or felt immediately that the softball the color of Welch 's grape juice on Whitey 's neck had something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misfortune was an opportunity for me . I had n't done anything for anybody but myself in a long , long time . <p> It was a peculiarly southern gesture , a southern moral equation , I know now : I 've committed adultery for a year , but if I drive a detested shedding man to the VA hospital in Corpus with no possible obvious benefit for myself , then I will once again be good , noble , generous . Southerners are stupid . But not in the ordinary way . ( Noblesse oblige has not survived into spellcheck ) . <p> " Stupid , " said Broussard the next morning . <p> My prince leaned in my window , pecked my cheek , and asked if I needed any money . I said no . Then he put both of his hands on the roof and just stood there . I studied Broussard 's belt buckle , which was actually a knife with a three inch blade . I waited for him to say something . But all Broussard did was stare over at the blue boat dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could have been a filling station attendant trying to think of the best directions to give me . <p> " Turn here , " the blanket barked . <p> Whitey had pulled the Coast Guard blanket over his head before we had even driven off the boat-as if he were so valuable that it was necessary to smuggle himself out of the yard . For the first fifty or so miles , it bothered me that he had the blanket over his head . It seemed a premature morbidity . But after a while I started to like it , Whitey rendered abstract . I was accompanying a living presence but one without particularity . He was there but not , a lump of humanity as worthy of my kindness or consideration as any other . <p> My car radio dial was frozen but two of the buttons still worked . One punched out a station that was the rock versions of religious songs , and the other was a station that played " Jolie Blonde " and " Cher ! Touton . " I beat out percussion on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving under brushed the top of the car . From under the blanket came a syncopated squeeze box rasp , and we were a sort of Salvation Army band . Our progress was unmusical , but full of goodwill . <p> Doing for others when there is little to be gained yourself does give one a smooth lift , a peculiar sort of happiness . I wondered how it was I could feel good even as I was pulling farther and farther away from Broussard . I thought of Broussard now with a warm and unsullied love , I could see him in the channel taking the boat out , the dolphins in his wake . I made the mistake that many people make who are in love . I assumed if I was thinking about him that he was thinking about me . I was so full of this happy state that I was startled when Whitey spoke , startled enough to turn . I had entirely forgotten about him . We could have been married . <p> It is a good idea in Louisiana to keep high . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandbag dike above glazed water . When we turned , the car felt perceptibly lower and lower . The paved road turned into caliche shell marked with puddles . Whitey grabbed the blanket off his head and peered through the trees . I did n't have a watch , but I believed it was a lot darker for this time of day than it ought to be . I was glad then , in that moment , to have a good liberal arts education . A little education protected you , shielded your brain from a belief in the phenomena reported in grocery store checkout line tabloids . I did n't believe in UFO 's , for example , and that was good because the cypress trees pressing in on the road and back into the swamps began to glow a deep and unlikely purple . <p> I do n't know how long we went on like that . I felt like the chauffeur at my own kidnapping . I followed Whitey 's barked directions , and the car was drawn inexorably into the purple glow in the trees . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Whitey who would only bark , " goddamn , goddamn , keep on keep on . " The car nosed slowly forward and with relief the Pontiac reared up into high and familiar ground , a huge well kept asphalt parking lot . <p> I was n't surprised . I had been on the road long enough to come to believe that parking lots were the ground of our being . This parking lot , big enough for a thousand cars , was empty at that hour , although I was disoriented and unsure of the time . I parked the car between two painted yellow lines , I had a roomy hundred acres in which to maneuver . The parking lot was n't a surprise , but the sign was : Carolyn 's . Broussard 's second ex-wife . The purple glowing neon sign was her name in script " Carolyn 's " - the tallest of the letters , the long and seductive " y " was maybe twenty feet high . The whole thing had a fifty-yard wingspread . An arrangement of cables-you could just barely see them-kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finally just some trailers strung together like railroad cars in the parking lot . The sign hovered there like a gigantic humming bird or a purple stealth bomber . <p> I got out of the car and leaned back my neck to get a better look at the thing . Whitey had gotten out on his side with the blanket in one hand and my rear view mirror in the other . The Pontiac had the kind of rear view mirror that stuck to the windshield with insufficient engineering and insufficient glue . <p> " Hold this goddamn it , " rasped Whitey . I held the mirror while Whitey primped . He combed his hair with a black rubber Ace comb from his back pocket , creating furrows in the dark colorless hair that looked purple in Carolyn 's light . His teeth looked radioactive . He stepped back and gathered the Coast Guard blanket in the way that James Mason did when he played a Roman senator . We then proceeded toward a set of concrete stairs installed in front of the first house trailer . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called back over his shoulder . He pointed upward with the comb . He was proud to be in any way associated with that sign . <p> Inside , my eyes seemed to hold the imprint of the sign before them-as the eyes can after a flash bulb goes off . All I could see was hundreds of the little signs but tiny : Carolyn Carolyn Carolyn . I was not quick to understand that the many thousands of Carolyns were wallpaper , a grape vine design . Only where the grapes ought to be there were these little clusters of Carolyns . I could n't see whether the carpet was purple , but the jukebox lights and about half the fifty or so beer clocks on the walls had some kind of neon work in the team color . On the back bar were bottles , a stand of slim jims , and giant jars of pickled eggs-the regular color . The bartender was a good- looking thirty year old in a petrocopter 's gim me cap . There was a Carolyn on his purple sports shirt where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up shop at the bar , with two happy hour rum and Cokes and a pack of Pall Malls in front of him . I thought about mentioning that it was probably time for him to quit . His blanket draped the floor and with his feathery head sticking out of the top , he looked like he 'd stuck his head through the top of a tepee . Carolyn was sitting on the barstool next to him in a velvet running suit of guess what color . She moved over for me , so I felt I could n't do anything but sit down between them . I ordered a coke . I was nervous . I pulled out a cigarette , but before I could locate a match or a Bic lighter our hostess had her engraved Zippo out . She lit my cigarette with a lavender butane flame . The Zippo had two names engraved in script . She left it on the bar , his name up . Everyone had always said she was beautiful , but I did n't know she was going to be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's my signature color , " Carolyn said . <p> " Ah , it 's lovely , " I said , and something like " thank you . " There was n't anything else to do but sit there and wait for her to ask me how I liked sleeping with her husband . I hoped I could keep the encounter light and humorous . I hoped I would say something like , " apparently better'n I like sleeping with mine . " <p> She never mentioned Broussard . Without being impolite , she talked somewhat over and around my head . She and Whitey seemed to know a hundred other people besides Broussard . But I felt Broussard 's presence in the room . I was as excited as if I 'd just seen his slouched-hip shadow in the doorway . I could smell him , his cologne , anyway . Brut . But possibly the high-content pheromone fragrance was leaking off Frog , the bartender . Carolyn never said a word about Broussard . I think an hour or two passed . Whitey drank several rum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice had melted in my glass and I guessed I was paying for these drinks . Whitey unstraddled the bar stool . <p> " Well , this was fun kids , " he said , " but it 's time for usuns to hit the road . Got ta get on to the goddamn veteran 's hospital . " <p> He waited a beat . He waited for her to ask about the hospital . She did n't . Then , he let the blanket slip so that Carolyn could have an eye full of the lump-o . It was the color of Welch 's grape juice in that light . I pulled up my purse and Whitey theatrically put his hand out on the purse . <p> " Naw , babe , hang on to our cash , we may be needing our-our ? cash to check into the hospital . I 'll just get ol ' Carolyn to just cash us some walkin ' around money . " <p> He looked at Carolyn . <p> " Hey ! Carolyn ol ' buddy could I cash a check . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . hospital , " he said all this very quickly . If he ran the words together fast it would , no doubt , spare a fine man like himself some of the embarrassment . <p> " No , " she said pleasantly . <p> " Carolyn , " he hung his head , he whispered , harsh , raspy , " I 'm dying and I wan na cash a check . " <p> " That 's fine , honey , " she said in a nurturing voice , " but you ca n't do either one of them in here . " <p> She escorted us to my car as if she was Perle Mesta . She wished us a safe trip . She said she was glad we 'd stopped by . <p> On the road again , Whitey and I seemed to have traded emotional levels . He was high , I was low . I felt scared , forlorn , bereft , and in dread . Something had scared me . Whitey seemed perky . He had pulled his blanket up around him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nap . But first he wanted a little chat . <p> " Ai n't she great ! She 's great ! Great ! " he said , " I told you Carolyn was great . " He never had . <p> " But she did n't cash your check , " I said . <p> " Yeah , " he leaned over to confide , " yeah . . . she 's even smarter than Broussard . And way meaner . . " <p> He settled down happy , ready for his nap after instructing me to turn back east for a bit . He knew somebody , a buddy in New Iberia , that owed him a favor . That guy was sure to cash him a check . <p> Once started on a check cashing binge Whitey could n't be stopped . I pulled into dozens of identical beer joints , went down back roads , tried , I think , some of them twice . Whitey knew of course that the check was bad , and the owners of these establishments , they all knew the check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , sure , " he looked at me like I was even stupider than he 'd heard , " that 's where personality comes into it . " <p> " What do you need to cash a check for ? " I asked . I thought it an appropriate question . <p> " Because some prissy missy did n't get our goddamn money . " That shut me up for a while . It had never occurred to me that when Broussard offered me money on the deck before we pulled away that it was a way of offering money to Whitey . But I could see that it might have been . <p> I was feeling , I thought , post-do-gooder , post-missionary let-down . I 'd felt bad ever since we left Carolyn . Nothing precise I could put my finger on . Carolyn had n't been mean to me . She was solicitous , polite . She had offered me a job . The words came back to me , when you need a job Peggy , you 've got one here . Did I need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me feel that she knew things I did n't know . She made you feel that she knew everything . I told Whitey about the job offer . He looked caught out for a second . Then , he said cordially , <p> " See . . . She 's all right . " <p> " But she said , ' a job , Peggy . " ' <p> " So goddamn it ? " <p> " My name 's not Peggy . " <p> He skipped a beat . " I knew that , " he said . <p> He threw a portion of the blanket over his shoulder and dismissed the whole topic as petty and unworthy of further discussion . <p> " Peggy , Annie , Susie , Mullet , what the goddamn hell difference does it make ? Do n't make no difference . ' S all the same . " <p> He closed his eyes . <p> Whitey was not the person to have a conversation with about names . He was into aliases . I was n't even sure what his name was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extend the courtesy of aliases , mysteriously and without reason , to others . Birdie lived in a common-law marriage with a shrimper named Dezell . And even after Dezell blew out Whitey 's plate glass picture window with a shotgun , Whitey kept dating Birdie . But for discretion 's sake-and because he loved them-he began to employ aliases . Sometimes we would be sitting in the Anchor Inn . Whitey would stroll in with Birdie . ( Dezell would be out shrimping . Whitey would , then , introduce Birdie . <p> " This here is Judy , " he would say to a bar full of people who had known her since elementary school as either as Mary Margaret or Birdie . <p> It turned out that it was Birdie-Judy-Mary Margaret for whom the desperate check needed to be cashed .

Every time I had ever bought a pack of cigarettes or a pack of Doritos , the bag and the change had gone into the back seat . We pulled over to the side of the road . I must have had fifty dollars worth of quarters back there , some of it still in the small brown bags . <p> " We 'll pull out the seats if we need more , " said Whitey . <p> At the next roadside pay-phone , we pulled over , again . Whitey took his blanket and two fistfuls of quarters into the glass box and closed the door . I could see him yelling in the phone as he dropped in additional quarters . After about a half an hour , he got back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned sharply and looked me up and down as I started the car . <p> " So , " he said , " have you ever had any practice at it ?

" <p> " Not me , " I said , " I was always the bride . " <p> Feeling as if I was missing part of this conversation , I put the car into high gear . <p> Birdie , dressed in a tulle-skirted wedding gown , waved to us from the high concrete porch front of Whitey 's house . The windows that Dezell had shot out were still boarded over with plywood . Positioned in front of them , Birdie looked like a mannequin in a bridal shop that had gone out of business . Her aquamarine frame glasses swooped up at the temples where her hair , a soft platinum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white tulle dress that did justice in its bodice to what is called the full figure . The skirt studded with bugle beads sparkled in the sunlight . Her little daughter was sitting below her on the steps dressed up as flower girl . Her socks had stiff little ruffles at the ankles . For something to do , her boys were picking up the glass in the driveway . The oldest one kept chunking shards back toward the house . <p> " Bryan put that down , " Birdie yelled from the porch . <p> " S'not hurtin ' nuthin ' , " the boy said , studying the ground for a bigger shard . <p> I had to yell for the little boy to move back so I could pull in . Whitey got out of my car and moved toward his steps , treading a course through the many big plastic washbaskets and cardboard boxes sitting around his yard . Birdie had moved everything they owned out of Dezell 's . She waited happily on the porch for her fiance . She looked serene . <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use the bathroom . I got back into my car . After a while Whitey came and got in beside me . He thumped the roof . <p> " Let 's go goddamn it . " He was wearing a morning coat , striped trousers , a tuxedo shirt and carrying a gray silk striped cravat in his hand . <p> " Hospital ? " I asked . <p> " The Ritz , " he said . The Ritz was a carwash on 59 . <p> Whitey had explained to Birdie that it was imperative they go into Corpus to the hospital first . Then , they 'd see to the wedding part . But Birdie said no , the justice of the peace was on 59 , so we should go by there first because it was on the way . After that , she said , it 'd be a good idea for them all to go to the doctor . It was time for Bryan 's booster shots and , anyway Whitey should sure get somebody to look at that spot on his neck . But before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my car to the twenty-four-hour carwash . She had followed him back into the yard , holding the hoop of her skirt out from her in both hands like a hula-hoop . <p> " I did n't mean to hurt your feelings about your car , " she said , " but I want to have my dress heirloomed . We 'll pay for the wash . " She asked Whitey if he needed her laundromat quarters and he said , no that he had plenty of quarters . I told her that I had meant to get the car washed anyway . <p> At the Ritz , I sat on a concrete wall and watched Whitey suck my life out of the back seat with a big wet-dry vac . <p> " Do n't you want some of this stuff , " Whitey asked . He had stripped down to his immaculate T-shirt and was doing an excellent job of washing the car . He was a good detail man . <p> " No , just keep the teacups , " I said . I could n't for some reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of it go . Which was good because he only gave me a second to make up my mind . He was enormously energetic when settled on a project . The seats were never going to be white again-but they came out a kind of delicate and yellowish leather , the color that ladies ' gloves had once been . He turtle waxed the top of the car with the Coast Guard blanket and then threw it into an oil barrel trash can . When we pulled back into the driveway Whitey 's new family was waiting on his porch . Birdie had taken the curlers out of her hair and put on a full spring makeup . <p> " Judy looks just like Doris Day , " he said . <p> The courthouse was only open for another half-hour-Whitey would n't do a job unless he could do it right and he 'd worked on the car at the car wash for hours-so Whitey and I had to change clothes in the courthouse restrooms . Whitey did not balk at all at the idea of a bridegroom 's outfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crook . Birdie followed me into the ladies , trailing the dress meant for me on a metal hanger . I dropped the thing like a flannel nightie over my head . I drowned in it . <p> " Purple , " she said , " that really is your color . " <p> That upset me but I do n't think it was spite that made me decide to tell her-or warn her . <p> " Birdie , I think you should think about why Whitey wants to get married now . . . " I began . <p> " Well better late than never , " she trilled . " Wait , I got to pee . " <p> She installed herself and the rowboat-size skirts of white tulle into the stall with her . The next year when Princess Di afloat in her glass carriage stuffed with tissue tulle waved to her subjects , I would think again of how perfectly confident Birdie looked in that moment . <p> I told her that it was possible , just possible , that Whitey was sick , that perhaps he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship would be unequal , that he might not fulfill her needs . And Birdie told me that when you loved someone , you did n't expect anything back . So I told her that Whitey thought he had cancer . <p> " Oh , that 's silly , " said Birdie , pushing her white skirts ahead of her out of the stall . <p> The ceremony was brief , sober , and lovely . The flower girl threw single stem carnations that we had picked up at the HEB all over the indoor-outdoor carpet of the courthouse . Whitey in the rented morning suit looked , Birdie thought , like Rhett Butler . He was disappointed that he could n't wear the striped tie because it was held in place by a " diamond " stick pin . But Birdie fastened a carnation on his lapel with the pin . I noticed that little flecks were accumulating on the trousers and cuffs . It looked like he had dandruff on his wrists . <p> " You 're never going to get your deposit back , " I said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " maybe he can get some more wear out of it . " <p> Birdie signed the register Mary Margaret Reber McComb Dezell . And Whitey signed , Herman C. Doerr . Truth and sweetness were , then , for an hour in the air . <p> We spent most of that night in the waiting room chairs of the emergency room of the Corpus Christi Veteran 's Hospital . The wedding finery wilted through the night on the grown ups , the kids had left parts of their dress-up clothes in my car . They went to sleep on the waiting room chairs . When the nurse called for Whitey , she said , " Mr. Doerr , Mr. Doerr , Mr. Doerr , Mr. Doerr . " And when the young resident came out at one o'clock to tell Whitey that all he had was some kind of infected lymph node , he , too , said , " Nothing to worry about Mr. Doerr . . . " Whitey was ecstatic during the trip back to Aransas Pass . Birdie whispered to me that she 'd always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The groom still rode shotgun . Birdie got back in the back and the children fell asleep in the folds of her net dress . When I helped carry them into the house their cheeks were crisscrossed like they 'd been pressed too long to a screen door . Inside , Whitey fussed at her a little-but gently-about the fact that she had called Dezell-on the ship-to-shore phone-to tell him she was getting married . <p> " I could n't just leave him a note , " said the bride . <p> Birdie could n't thank me enough for bringing her husband home to her . She showed me to my car . <p> For the next two weeks , I slept in the Pontiac . Then , one afternoon , I went into the Anchor Inn to ask for a job . On that road , The Anchor Inn was the last dry spot before you reached the gulf . It was on stilts and high tide reduced the parking lot by one-half . That afternoon , my car , Dezell 's pickup , and Whitey 's Ford were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Whitey were cordially buying one another long necks . A delicate and gentlemanly negotiation was underway : which one of them was going to take Birdie and the kids ? Neither seemed to really want her . Whitey did n't need a nurse , after all ; Dezell had met a new young thing . It was to their credit , though , that the idea that both of them could dump Birdie did not appear on their agenda . I carried the job application and a Coke outside . <p> Birdie was out on the deck steps with her little girl beside her . She was painting the child 's tiny nails with polish from her " spring " makeup kit . The girl held her hand very still , the fingers splayed wide on her mother 's knee . She had wrapped Birdie 's wedding veil around her waist and fastened it there with a bathrobe belt . <p> " She 's a princess , " Birdie said . The boys were headlocking one another down by the surf . <p> That 's when Birdie told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do n't look out for us anymore , " she said . <p> I told her not to worry , that one of them would take her home . <p> " I shamed them into it , " she said . <p> But , actually Birdie would be all right . You can not shame a man into something unless he recognizes the tradition as applicable to himself . Whitey and Dezell might have been the sad tail end of a thousand year old chivalric tradition-but they could be expected to play . Nothing that I knew of , however , seemed applicable to me and my situation . Place of residence , the application said . <p> It would not occur to my husband and Broussard to sit down , buy one another long necks and figure out who was going to take me always as his lady fair and give me preference . Anyway , I would have objected . I had taught them to think this new way . We were now all relatively positioned , bodies of equal gravity and moment . <p> I 'd used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a phone box on Loop610 when Whitey and I skirted Houston . A woman answered the phone . That hurt , but , I felt glad that my husband was n't lonely anymore . While Whitey vacuumed out the car , I had sat on a cement fence reading my divorce decree . It must have been back there all month . When the judge 's wife asked Birdie if I was the Matron of Honor , I heard her whisper , " Well , she 's a divorcee . " Marital status , the application said . <p> There were people who thought that I took the job at the Anchor Inn so that I could watch out for Broussard 's boat when it came in . Wrong . Broussard had Mac cooking for him . Wherever Broussard 's boat moored those days , a white Mustang with red racing stripes parked next to it . The license plate read PEG and a macrame potted plant hanger dangled from the rear-view mirror . The first few times I spotted the Mustang parked beside Broussard 's car , I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those feelings and most of the others . <p> It was restful working at the Anchor Inn . I sat out on the porch with my back to the entire new world . I looked out to sea and could contemplate the faint scattered outlines of the old world sailing away . The firmament of the old world had been composed of more than a few assumptions , a few rules . One knew , for example , that one always buried people . If Whitey had really died in the Pontiac I would have pulled over and buried him . Another assumption concerned the care of women by men . That 's the one I 'd help blast all to hell . I could hardly claim its protection now . I could see how I 'd been flying back and forth between two men . I thought at the time , that I was a lady choosing . I thought I was high up in a wooden gallery , that pennants snapped in a cold wind , that I would soon bestow my winter colors . I thought I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , the night I drove Whitey and Birdie back from Corpus , I backed out of their driveway as the lights came on in the house . It came to me that I did n't know where I was supposed to drive next . I kept backing up and backing up in the darkness . My tires felt like they were n't meeting any friction , and I backed right off the end of the known world out here where I continue to fall , out here where it is lonesome and interesting and all the room I will ever need . <p>
