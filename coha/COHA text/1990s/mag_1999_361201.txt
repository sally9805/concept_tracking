The vagabonding Isa ( Elodie Bouchez ) meets Marie ( Natacha Regnier ) on an assembly line in Lille . It 's hard work . But friendship is a tougher job , as this haunting first feature proves . Isa is defiantly sunny , her pal severe , volcanic . Isa tries awful things ( like a job handing out flyers on rollerskates ) because , hey , they could be " tres cool " ; Marie endures awful things ( like an affair with a bourgie creep ) to confirm her dour view of the world . The stars shared the Best Actress prize at Cannes last year , and both are brilliant . But Bouchez 's expressive face lets you speed-read each of a dozen moods in a few seconds . That 's innate screen genius . <P>  --  R.C.
