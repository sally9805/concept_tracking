<p> Steve and Tina Bono slide into a corner window table at the Zuni Cafe . He takes the end seat to stretch his bum left knee , which puts him into the air space of two South of Market smokers . But he does n't complain , just blends in with a dry martini , two olives , as Tina orders a manhattan . <p> Though his own Cinderella season was ended by injury , and the 49ers finish short of the playoffs tonight , the Bonos , both 29 , are in a celebratory mood . For once , he might have a safe job next year . <p> " It 's been terrific , " says Bono , with a wide-angle smile spanning six seasons on the bench . " I 've gotten a chance to play , and it 's gone the way that I hoped it would . " <p> Earlier that day , his mother , Cornelia , just in from her job as a switchboard operator at a grocery in Norristown , Pa. , puts it more succinctly . " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Certainly not Bono , much less Tina . Before the season , he was known around the 49er locker room as the " I Got You , Babe " guy , a reference to his shaggy-vested namesake , Sonny . <p> Then his golfing pal , Joe Montana , went down , followed by Steve Young . The backup to the backup put down his clipboard and became quarterback . By mid- December , he had the team on a five-game roll , and even cerebral coach-turned-commentator Bill Walsh was singing his praise . <p> " The system of football is functioning beautifully with Steve Bono , " he gushed a week ago Saturday as Bono threw three touchdown passes for the third consecutive game , something even the great Montana has accomplished only once . <p> Which brings him a long way since last Christmas , when he stopped to admire an old Montana poster in a Marina sports bar . <p> " He named the game , the players , the poster , and no one knew who he was , " recalls his college pal , San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time we go out . " <p> " I expected it a little bit , but I did n't expect it on this kind of scale , " Bono says of the notoriety . <p> He had been approached before , but usually only by the guys who wear gold " Forty-Niners " jackets year-round . " You must be a real fan , " he 'd say , " to recognize me . " <p> On the celebrity scale now , he considers himself somewhere between " where I used to be and Joe . " This still gives him more fame than most Democratic presidential candidates . <p> " He 's an exciting story , " announced Dick Enberg to a national TV audience , " for young people who seem to be overlooked . " <p> That would have made a nice football epitaph until mid-season . " I had n't practiced regularly , with the first string , for seven years , " Bono says . <p> A BIG FAMILY <p> But it did n't start that way . He grew up in the Philadelphia suburb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a very Italian neighborhood , " says his mother , who happens to be Irish . His father , Biagio  --  " Bill , " though Steve calls him " Beep "  --  is a machinist , one of 11 siblings , who have delivered Bono 50 cousins on the one side alone , all living nearby . <p> Bono has three sisters , the youngest of whom , Consuelo ( " Toot " to Steve ) , 23 , is doing someone 's hair downstairs in the family home . <p> " Been here since I was born , hon , " she says . " Is n't that nice ? " <p> At 10 , Bono qualified to compete for a national Punt , Pass and Kick competition during halftime of a 49ers game at Candlestick Park . It was his first airplane trip . He was , however , eliminated the day before , so instead of going to the game , he and Beep toured the city . It was the first of several unexpected stops in the Bay Area . <p> The next came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My husband and I were born and raised and still live in this burg , " Cornelia says . " I told him to get out and see the world . " <p> Preston Raisin met Bono while double-dating to a sorority party . " He was the only freshman I knew , " says Raisin , " who pulled a girl 's chair out to sit down . " But what surprised him was Bono 's appetite for butter with his pizza crust . <p> " He 's never forgotten where he came from , " says Raisin . <p> After his third year at UCLA , including one that he sat out , Bono still had n't played a meaningful down . He met Tina , a transfer from UC Santa Barbara , before summer break , then went home for a few weeks to Norristown . <p> Tina , meanwhile went to San Francisco as an I. Magnin intern . He flew back to L.A. with $ 100 his father had given him , and spent it on a flight to San Francisco . He caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seedy Tenderloin around midnight . <p> " This guy got off the bus and I started following him real close , " he says , " so people would think I was with him . " <p> He talked his way past the guard of her boarding house . Tina came in from a party past 2 a.m. and found him sleeping on the lobby couch . <p> " From then on , " she says , " we 've been together . " <p> His football fortunes picked up as well . In his first game as a UCLA starter , he set school records for passing and total yardage in a 37-35 loss to Brigham Young , with one Steve Young as quarterback coached by Mike Holmgren , whom Bono would hear from later . <p> The three-year wait had paid off , and excitement built for his second start , against Stanford . Tina drove down to Palo Alto with some friends , just in time to see Bono go down with an arm injury . <p> " I was depressed , " he says . " Reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , but for five years of effort started only 11 college games . And after a few years knocking around the pros , he had hardened into a football vagabond . <p> " I 'd go , " he says , " wherever they would take me , " which was Minnesota , then Pittsburgh . <p> " In our whole marriage , " says Tina , " we 've been somewhere for a season , then moved . " <p> Before the 1989 season , 49er offensive coordinator Holmgren suddenly recalled that old BYU- UCLA game , and decided he needed both quarterbacks . Bono was summoned for a tryout for the third and final spot , and beat out a little Fresno State star named Kevin Sweeney , who has n't been heard from since . <p> Bono knows that feeling . <p> " When it 's good , it 's real good and when it 's bad , it 's real bad , " he says . " I 'd been cut two or three times , so I 've seen the other end of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there have been close calls , always at the end of summer when final cuts and trades are tendered . <p> " Labor Day is not a holiday for us , " says Tina . " It 's ' cross your fingers and hope he makes the team . ' " <p> After this year 's finger-crossing , they bought a ranch-style house in Palo Alto , which only heightens the doubt . <p> " We thought for sure we 'd be traded and have to move again , " says Tina , adopting the plural pronoun of sports wives . " But we thought we 'd take a chance . " <p> Which looks pretty good about now . <p> " I told my coach , " he says with typical modesty , " ' I hope I 've bought myself a couple of years . ' " <p> Rumor is he also may have bought the other Steve a trip to a different team , along with a raise for himself . He has one year left on his contract , which pays $ 275,000 , compared with $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When things looked particularly bleak , Bono entered a stockbroker training program in L.A. , where they own a condo . He does n't think he will be going back . <p> " There 's all kinds of things that are coming up now , " he says . " Speaking engagements , autograph sessions , the type of thing I never expected . " <p> Tina has worked in retail , charity and as an aerobics instructor , but has been uprooted too frequently for anything to stick . She would like to start an image consulting business and knows where to find her first spokesman . <p> " He 's been through so many ups and downs the last seven years , " she says , " he should get into motivational speaking . " <p> The only immediate motivating he wants to do is onto a quiet Hawaiian beach for a long nap . Reality will return soon enough . <p> " It 's probably that time when you feel secure , " he says knowingly , " that something bad happens . " <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I was at the mall today at lunchtime and two people stopped me who remembered Steve when he was little , " brags his mother . " If he never plays another game , he has done us proud . "
