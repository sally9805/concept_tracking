For a moment last week , two traits of Bob Dole the lawmaker came to the rescue of Bob Dole the candidate  --  the ability to swallow your pride and to make peace with your past . To arrive at the astonishing choice of Jack Kemp as his running mate , a man who has spent a good part of his political career spearing Bob Dole , required both . Dole admitted as much in a Thursday-night phone call to Mississippi Senator Trent Lott , his successor as majority leader and a good friend of Kemp 's . If Kemp was the one , Dole told Lott , it would be a signal to everyone of how seriously Dole wanted to win , for there could hardly be a tougher choice for him to accept . <P> Kemp is the one , and his anointment by Dole adds not just excitement but something like psychological fascination to the campaign . Dole , who has said he wanted his running mate to be " a 10 , " introduced Kemp on Saturday with the words " I got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jersey number . As a matter of sheer political accounting , who can argue ? Wildly popular with large segments of his party , Kemp also has the crucial potential to appeal beyond them . His support for immigration , school and housing vouchers and affirmative action gives him appeal to minorities and women voters who say the G.O.P. is too hard-nosed and exclusionary . " He 's one of the few people in our party who has spoken in union halls and at N.A.A.C.P. conventions and has been applauded , " says Dole senior adviser Charles Black . <P> As one of the chief congressional architects of Reagan 's 1981 tax cuts , Kemp opens a direct channel in voter memory to the era of good feeling that was early Reaganism . Though not identified with the controversial Christian wing of the party , he also has the longtime pro-life credentials to satisfy them . Originally from California , he polls well in that crucial state , where Dole is trailing Clinton by 25 points . <P> Above all , Kemp is a man with vision and optimism to spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus . But the potential for conflict that he brings to the campaign is also inescapable . Kemp the supply-side tax cutter and Dole the dogged budget balancer have been ideological enemies for almost two decades . At some point the political antagonism tilted into the personal . Kemp was partly responsible for the single most painful political betrayal in Dole 's life . In 1985 , after the supply-side tax cuts championed by Kemp were followed by an exploding federal deficit , Dole pushed through the Senate a politically daring curb on cost of living adjustments ( COLAS ) for Social Security recipients . To squeeze out a one-vote majority in the Senate , Dole had to arrange for Republican Pete Wilson , then a Senator from California , to be wheeled in from emergency surgery . But when the bill got to the House , Kemp , who still believed that growth spurred by tax cuts would make deep spending cuts unnecessary , got White House chief of staff Donald Regan to persuade Ronald Reagan to oppose it . The bill died after Reagan allied himself with none other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The episode helped Democrats regain control of the Senate the next year . Dole aides said Kemp would never be forgiven .
