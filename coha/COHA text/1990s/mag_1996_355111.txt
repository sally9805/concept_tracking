Being President of the U.S. , Commander in Chief of the armed forces and acknowledged leader of the free world must not be all that it used to be . All that , and Bill Clinton still does n't qualify as one of the 25 most influential people in America ? What ever happened to the prerogatives of office ? Whom do you have to know to get on this list ? <P> If that roll call identified the most powerful people in America rather than the most influential ( a more subtle concept ) , then the President would be at the top . Power and influence generally go hand in hand . Anyone who has the clout to make decisions with the stroke of a pen has influence over the way we think and live . But some people , particularly Presidents , are more notable for the former than the latter . Clinton is powerful . He can propose how to parcel out the federal budget , stock the federal courts and decide which uncooperative trade partners get spanked . Influential is another matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for now ) with the budget , he 's a man who does n't so much shape national opinion as locate it , then wraps his arms around whatever he has found and holds on for dear life . What he sometimes lacks is those things that help define influence : a vision that inspires people to shed their doubts and follow his lead , an ability to connect with people and shape the way they look at the world . This is why the same man who can order troops to Haiti can still lose a floor vote in Congress on health care . <P> One other distinction between power and influence : a list of the most influential people in America reflects at least some of the nation 's racial and ethnic diversity and includes both men and women . But for now , any inventory of the people who really pull the levers of power is topped by white men in suits . The President and the Federal Reserve Board chairman , the leaders of Congress , the chiefs of industry and communication  --  these are the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money is spent , how troops and workers get deployed , which programs and movies are distributed , who gets promoted and who gets laid off , which factories are closed and what happens to interest rates and insurance premiums . <P> To hold power is to have at your disposal blunt instruments . But without influence , power dies out at the end of its own channels of command . To have influence is to gain assent , not just obedience ; to attract a following , not just an entourage ; to have imitators , not just subordinates . Power gets its way ( when it gets it ) . Influence makes its way . And in free societies it makes its way further .
