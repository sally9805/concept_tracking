Section : INTERIOR BODYBUILDING Here 's what you wanted to know about strength training  --  and were n't afraid to ask SIXTH IN A SIX-PART SERIES <p> YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECIsion . You bolstered your walking program with a little extra muscle . You followed the Interior Bodybuilding series , learning and building on new muscle-enhancing exercises to boost strength and improve your health . As with any new program , though , the more you do and learn , the more questions you have . Many of you have asked us some thoughtful questions , and we 've collected them and pumped the experts in the field of resistance for some honest answers . Hope this helps you . Q : Once one exercise becomes easy , should I increase the weight , increase the number of repetitions or stay where I am ? <p> A : If you simply continue on the same level and do n't change the amount of resistance or repetitions , you wo n't get any stronger  --  but you wo n't get weaker either . So if you 're happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities is improved to your liking  --  that 's fine . Just keep on with what you 're doing and enjoy yourself . Now , if you want to improve on what you 've already done , you can increase the weights or repetitions . This depends on your own goals . " If you want to continue improving your strength , of course , you 'll have to increase the amount of resistance you use , " says Doug Semenick , wellness and conditioning director for the University of Louisville . " That 's at the heart of progressive resistance training  --  to get stronger you have to encounter more resistance . " <p> And if you 're looking for bigger , bulkier muscles , the key is to increase the weight consistently while keeping the repetitions limited  --  exercising in the 8-to-15-repetition range . <p> Now if you stay at the same weight , while increasing the number of repetitions , you 'll maintain your strength . You wo n't improve it , but instead " you 'll develop more muscular endurance , " says Semenick . That 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in body composition  --  meaning a loss in body fat , " says Semenick . " And it may help you more with everyday activities . It 's highly unlikely you 'll need short bursts of strength to do something . Carrying a piece of luggage across an airport , though , requires some muscle endurance , " he says . <p> Semenick cautions that " just because you work out and the exercises feel easy , that does n't necessarily mean that you are strong enough to increase the weight the very next time you 're exercising . You may just have had a good day . That following increase in weight the next workout may actually be too much and come too quickly , " he says . " Wait an extra exercise session after the weight feels easy before you decide to go up  --  then you 'll be able to handle the weight . " Q : Can I aerobically train and strength train on the same day ? And if I do , is there a right order in which to do them ? <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little reason not do both on the same day . Serious weight lifters may find a decrease in their strength gains  --  but for us regular folk , it makes very little difference . " I suggest you exercise aerobically and then go to the strength training afterward , " says Robert Goldman , D.O. , Ph.D. , president of the National Academy of Sports Medicine in Chicago , Illinois . " The aerobic work will help warm up your body . That warmup is important because it helps to greatly reduce chance for injury by preparing your body for the stresses of strength training . <p> If you 're doing more strenuous aerobic work , like a StairMaster or a cross-country skiing machine , however , you may want to save that for afterward instead . " If you 're really training hard aerobically , you may not feel like strength training when you 're done , " says James G. Garrick , M.D. , director of the Center for Sports Medicine at St.Francis Memorial Hospital , in San Francisco , California . " In that case , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your aerobic exercise instead . " Q : If I feel a pain , say in my lower back , while I 'm lifting a weight , should I " work through it " or stop altogether ? <p> A : " The rule of thumb I tell my patients is that if you can tell the exact second the pain started  --  that first spark or bang of pain during a lift  --  then back off , " says Dr. Garrick . " And if the pain 's in a joint , never work through it , just stop . If it 's in the muscle , though , and it 's not a sharp sensation with only a little discomfort , then continuing to exercise may not be a problem . " If it worsens as you go on , then stop . <p> Sometimes the pain you feel from lifting weights may be the dull nag of " second-day soreness . " " After you start resistance training , this ache may develop and peak in two days , " says Semenick . " It can last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's an inevitable part of strength training and no cause for alarm . " Even experienced athletes get depressed when they first experience it , but you need to understand it 's an unavoidable , but temporary , thing . If you continue to strength train , your body adapts , and the pain wo n't come back . " Q : How long should I rest between sets of exercises ? <p> A : No pumping-ironclad rule exists here . " But a general guideline would be : Rest 30 seconds between warm-up sets , two minutes between regular training sets and two to five minutes between very heavy maximum sets , " says Semenick . Q : How quickly should you do the actual exercise ? <p> A : " When you 're lifting the weight , it 's prudent to just control the weight  --  going too fast may cause you to lose that control , " says Semenick . <p> Dr. Garrick agrees . " If you go too fast , you introduce momentum into the picture , which can do a lot of the resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also set you up for more chance of injury . Q : Which is better for building strength : free weights or those shiny machines at the gym ? <p> A : " There are advantages to both types of equipment , " says Dr. Garrick . " Machines are great no-brain exercises , in that the machine you sit in guides the exercise  --  there is n't really much you can do wrong . " This may be a good idea if you 're exercising in a gym without adequate supervision . <p> But Dr. Garrick thinks you 're better off with free weights . " Technique is more important with free weights , and it forces you to do the exercise slowly and correctly , " he says . " And if you 're an imaginative sort , you can do anything you want with free weights  --  you are n't limited . " With free weights hundreds of exercises are at your fingertips . " It 's important that you do them precisely , though , because it 's much easier to get injured with a free weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> And for at-home exercisers , free weights are also easier to store . If you work out at a gym , though , take advantage of both types of resistance . Q : Does it matter in what order you do the exercises ? <p> A : " It 's better to do large muscles first , " says Dr. Goldman . " That helps get your blood circulating better . " Save small muscles for last ( forearms , for example ) , because they tire faster . <p> Adds Semenick , " You should also alternate upper-body with lower-body exercises . " Q : What can I do to reduce stress on my back or lower my chances for back injury while I lift ? <p> A : The key is to be conscious all the time of the position your back is in while you 're doing an exercise . " If you 're sitting , for instance , have the belt-line of your back pressed against the back of the chair . If you 're lying on a bench , concentrate on reversing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally is a few inches off the ground in this position  --  just push the lower back onto the surface . If you 're standing , keep your back and head uniformly straight , " says Dr. Garrick . <p> Here again taking your time becomes extra important . " The single biggest problem with weight lifting is people who push the weights too fast and too hard and arch their back because of it , " says Dr. Garrick . <p> " It also helps to do standing exercises in front of a mirror , " says Semenick . " You can make sure your chest is high and your back is straight by making eye contact in the mirror . " Q : I 'm not so much interested in getting huge muscles  --  I just want to be able to unscrew a cap from a jar . Are there any exercises that can help me ? <p> A : Wrist and reverse wrist curls can help fight jar wars by increasing the flexors and extensors in the hand , says Semenick . ( We showed you how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May . ) <p> But to get even more specific , start squeezing . " While reading or watching television , squeeze a rubber ball , " he says . " Squeeze it as tightly as you can , and hold it for a few seconds and let it loose and repeat , for about 10 repetitions . When it gets easier , increase the repetitions to 20 , then 30 . " Dr. Garrick suggests using an exercise putty as well as a grip booster . Q : How and when should I breathe when I strength train ? <p> A : The most important tip , of course , is to breathe . The next important tip is to keep breathing . When you hold your breath for a prolonged period of time while exercising , you 're engaging in a potentially dangerous activity called the Valsalva maneuver ( see " Pump Down High Blood Pressure " in June 's issue ) , which cuts off oxygen to your brain . You should learn to breathe in on the easy part , breathe out on the hard part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . <p> Let 's use the bench-press exercise as an example : You 're lying on your back , on a bench , with the weight bar above you . As you take the weight evenly down toward your chest , you should inhale . Touch your chest with the bar , and then on the way up , exhale . " You do n't have to blow the air out , just let it whistle out , " says Semenick . " If the weight is real heavy , you can hold your breath for a brief second as you prepare to hoist it . " Q : How can I get rid of the flab that hangs on my arms and inner thigh ? Can weights help ? <p> A : Weights can help firm you up , but they alone wo n't cure " poster " flab ( the kind that just hangs there ) . " That requires a total health strategy  --  combining exercise and a low-fat diet , " says Dr. Garrick . Triceps work for the arms and exercises to strengthen muscles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds , but " fat deposition can be genetic , and it seems to go just where it wants . " <p> " Spot reduction is a myth , " says Dr. Goldman . " When you exercise , you will lose fat all over the body  --  we are n't lucky enough to pick and choose where we 'd like it to go . " So keep at it  --  exercise works the entire body in one blanketed shot  --  it 's not weight-loss archery . Q : I see a lot of those bodybuilders on television , and I 'm worried I might get too big from lifting . Is that really going to be a problem ? <p> A : Those massively built specimens make strength training a full-time career . By exercising with weights three times a week for 45 minutes , you have nothing to worry about  --  unless getting stronger and feeling and looking fit causes you to worry . Q : Are there any nutritional tips that can help me boost my muscle building ? <p> A : Here 's the true beauty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would like to put on , you need extra calories to make it happen . That means you can eat more . <p> You need about an additional 2,500 calories in your diet to create a pound of muscle mass . So if you 're going to gain an extra pound of mass in a week , you need about an additional 350 daily calories . Remember , too , that muscle is metabolically more active tissue than fat and requires energy , and thus burns more calories than fat , which is metabolically lazier . <p> As for the types of foods to target , the experts agree on complex carbohydrates  --  breads , potatoes , fruits and vegetables . And for good reasons . <p> Complex carbohydrates are only four calories a gram  --  half that of fat . Plus , because they 're complex , it takes more energy for them to go through the digestive system and get broken down by the body into their usable parts . So , in fact , over 10 percent of the calories consumed are used up in the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build muscles you needed gobs of protein  --  after all , that 's what muscle is really made of anyway . Most people , though , get enough protein in their normal diet and do n't need to supplement that . The extra protein you tack on to your diet will most likely get passed through the body or stored and converted into fat . Q : I would like to start working out at a gym , but I 'm a bit nervous about all those huge people in there . What should I do ? <p> A : This is a common , natural worry  --  one you 'll get over once you find a gym that 's right for you . It simply depends on where you go . <p> Since all gyms are different , feel free to shop around . As strength training and fitness in general become more and more popular , new gyms continue to sprout up  --  all with different personalities and clientele . <p> Two other tips can help you find a gym that 's the right fit for you , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already exercising at a gym , ask to go with him . " He can show you the ropes , and chances are if your friend finds the gym comfortable , you 'll also find it suitable . <p> If you do n't know someone who 's already working out , Dr. Garrick suggests going to a gym and meeting one of the instructors and spending your first session with him or her . And arrive to do business  --  in sweats and armed with questions . Q : Besides a better-looking bottom , are there any practical , healthy reasons to work on strengthening those muscles back there ? <p> A : Those are the gluteal muscles , one of the largest muscle masses in the body and often the most neglected . " As you grow older , you can have a tendency to lose the strength needed to simply bend over and pick things up , " says Semenick . " Sometimes when you rise back up , you have to put both hands on one knee for help . " Strengthening the " glutes , " along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flexible muscles , which enables you to do simple tasks with strength . Strengthening those muscles around the trunk also improves balance and may help prevent low back pain . <p> There are great exercises to strengthen that shapely area , particularly one called the lunge . " It 's a great all-around exercise that requires little or no weight , " says Semenick . In the exercise , you take long strides forward , placing one foot out in front of you while lowering the opposite knee almost to the floor . " Work on them slowly , first 10 repetitions and then 15 , then 20 or more . " Our exercises this month focus on the backside , highlighting the right way to lunge . <p> By Greg Gutfeld <p> BACKSIDE EXERCISE Alternated front lunge Keep head up , back straight , feet 14 inches apart . Step forward as far as possible with right leg until upper right thigh is almost parallel to the floor . Keep lower leg straight . Step back to starting position . Repeat with left leg . Can also be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sides . You can try it next to a chair , to hold onto to help maintain balance . Kneeling back kick Kneel with left knee on bench . Hold outer sides of bench , keeping arms locked . Let right leg hang down . Raise right leg straight back as far as you can ( keeping leg straight ) . Return to starting position and then repeat with left leg . Hyperextension Place body on waist-high bench . Bend over with your head down . Raise torso straight up until it 's a little past parallel . Return to original position and repeat . Freehand jump squat Stand with arms crossed over chest . Keep your head up , with your back straight and your feet roughly 16 inches apart . Squat until upper thighs are parallel to the floor . Jump straight up in the air as high as you can . Immediately squat and repeat the jump . <p>
