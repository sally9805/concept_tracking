THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A GOOD TERMINAL ILLness , but people who know Alzheimer 's disease consider it one of the worst . Its slow and agonizing course leads inexorably from memory lapses to personality changes to utter loss of intellectual functions to certain death . The emotional toll on the estimated 4 million Americans who suffer from the disease and on their families is incalculable ; the bills for nursing care are enormous . <P> That is why the advice of a Food and Drug Administration panel is being widely hailed . The committee urged the FDA to approve a new drug , tacrine , as the first treatment ever for Alzheimer 's . Tacrine is no cure . It just slows the disease 's progress , and only for about 20% of sufferers . Considering the horrific nature of the illness , the panel felt that even a little relief is better than none . While the FDA does n't have to go along , it probably will .                @ @ @ @ @
