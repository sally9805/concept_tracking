IMMIGRATION 'S TO BLAME Now that we at Population-Environment Balance have read your big ( and much-anticipated ) article on population growth , immigration and the environment ( cover story , November/December 1996 ) , our satisfaction is decidedly mixed . You got the story half right-you were clear and direct about the environmental disaster of worldwide population growth-but your treatment of immigration-generated U.S. population growth was sadly timid . As environmentalists , our position on immigration ought to be clear and rocksolid : it is simply a sub-set of population growth . The American people have in fact " voted " for population stability-our total lifetime fertility rate per woman has been at or below replacement levels for more than 20 years . Yet , despite this national consensus , we will never achieve population stabilization unless we reduce immigration as well . Next time you address this issue , we hope you will face up honestly to the implications of the facts you discover . And if the facts do n't jump out at you , call uswe have them ready . William Millan Senior Vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II Thank you for " Contents Under Pressure . The main feature on population was very good and quite thorough , effectively utilizing a number of important resources . I was equally pleased with the Ehrlichs interview-especially their public acknowledgement of the critical need for reductions in legal immigration . I must confess , however , that the immigration sidebar , " Give Us Your Tired , Your Poor ... , " appears to have been hastily prepared and somewhat under-researched . The most prominent authors on the subjects of population , immigration and the environment were conspicuous by their absence . Widely acclaimed experts like Garrett Hardin , Roy Beck , Virginia Abernethy and Peter Brimelow were neither interviewed nor referenced . Overlooked were nationally recognized resources like Population-Environment Balance , Center for Immigration Studies , Federation for American Immigration Reform , The Wilderness Society , and countless others which publish considerable data on these issues . Notwithstanding my disappointment that Donald Mann was the only interviewee representing immigration reform , his position was well represented , as were the results of the Roper Poll . Considerable space was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough , critical questions were not asked : Does the U.S. need high levels of immigration ? Who benefits ? Who suffers ? What impact does the current U.S. immigration policy have on the world 's poor ? Further , an accurate history of Emma Lazarus ' poem would have added some credibility . As noted in Recharting America 's Future by Roy Beck , Lazarus wrote a poem to be auctioned to raise money for the construction of the statue 's pedestal . Her poem was given no special attention at the inauguration and was never mentioned by the press ! Nearly two decades later , a friend of Lazarus , seeking a way to honor the long-dead poet , had the poem engraved on a small plaque and placed it inside the statue . It was never intendedby the statue 's creator , the U.S. government or the poet-that " Give us your tired , your poor ... " be interpreted as a basis for our current immigration policy ! Donna Panazzi Pittsburgh , PA IMMIGRATION ' NOT TO BLAME although I was pleased that your issue on population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding immigration , including the voice of the Political Ecology Group , I must protest the lack of journalistic objectivity . First , while the Weeden Foundation was acknowledged as providing financial support to your population series , you did not disclose that Weeden also supports over a dozen anti-immigrant groups , including Negative Population Growth ( NPG ) , which recently called for a virtual witch hunt to track down and deport half a million immigrants a year ( in a full-page ad featured in Harpers ) . Weeden is also leading efforts to influence the Sierra Club and urge its members to adopt an anti-immigrant agenda . Second , the article perpetuated the impression that immigrants are overwhelming the U.S. , rather than pointing out that the U.S. population was 15 percent foreign-born from 1870 to 1920 , but is only 7.8 percent foreign-born today . The main difference is that today 's immigrants are mostly people of color . While the anti-immigrant lobby denies they are motivated by racial concerns , this is what most bothers them about current immigration . If you doubt that immigrants of color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all undocumented immigrants are Latino , 90 percent of those arrested by the INS are Mexican nationals . Your special issue on global population failed to focus on the environmental impacts of consumption and the role of corporations and economic globalization .

We encourage you to make our contact information available on your web site as you have for NPG and others . Brad Erickson Political Ecology Group San Francisco , CA James Sheldon , executive director of The Weeden Foundation , replies : The Weeden Foundation is an environmental philanthropy that has been making grants to protect biological diversity around the globe for more than 30 years . Since there is a connection between population growth and the degradation of natural habitats , we devote roughly one-third of our grants budget to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the United States . The bottom line is that every nation has a responsibility not only to itself but to all citizens of Earth to become more sustainable . In the United States this means working to reduce our consumption of natural resources ( another Weeden Foundation program area ) and working to stabilize our population , i.e. , reducing the number of consumers . Whether we like it or not , immigration is a major component of population growth in the United States . At our current growth rate , we will surpass half a billion people early in the second half of the next century . I applaud Mr. Erickson 's goals of " bringing immigrants and environmentalists together to defend the environment , health and human rights of all our communities , " but I hope that same discussion would n't ignore all the facts about our unsustainable behavior . In direct response to Mr. Erickson 's accusations that the Foundation is racially motivated , he should be aware it devotes 40 percent of its total annual grant resources to projects in developing countries . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family planning and environmental education initiatives targeting immigrant communities ( and others ) here in the United States . To be sure , immigrants themselves are not to blame for their desire to seek out a better life , nor for our environmental ills , but half a billion resource-hungry Americans-no matter what their country of origin-is the worst legacy this nation could possibly leave to its own descendants or to the rest of the world . NO CONSPIRACY I would like to call attention to the misrepresentation of my views in your cover article on population . I have never said or written anywhere that the UN population agenda is a " conspiracy to coerce . " Instead , I have pointed out the many contradictions embedded in the Cairo consensus , particularly its call for women 's empowerment at the same time that it accepts the current " free market , " laissezfaire model of economic development . This model has led to the defunding of social services , including public health , the weakening of environmental regulations and growing income disparities in many countries . I have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to safe , legal and accessible abortion . This hardly " echoes the Christian right . " Characterizing feminist critics of population control this way may be a handy putdown , but it is poor journalism . Betsy Hartmann Director Population and Development Program Hampshire College Amherst , MA NOT QUITE GREEN David Helvarg 's article ( " Perception is Reality , " November/December 1996 ) aptly outlined the concept of " greenwashing , " the attempt by corporations to offer an environmentally friendly public facade . Elsewhere in the same issue , readers were able to see that strategy in action firsthand . A short piece on page 46 explains that the hotel industry is becoming more conservation-minded . While some of the examples cited to support this claim , such as the use of bulk soap and low-flow showerheads , are laudable , the one regarding the Miraval Resort in Arizona is laughable . If this hotel 's management , as well as the editors of E Magazine , believe that sticking water-thirsty palm trees and a fake babbling brook in the middle of the Sonoran Desert is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As to the replanting of trees during construction of this resort , many of Arizona 's native flora are protected and it 's likely the developer was merely adhering to state statutes . Besides , if you 've ever seen how developers in Arizona replant desert vegetation , palm trees mixed with saguaro cacti , you 'd be more outraged than encouraged by the hotel 's industry 's " green commitment " there . I 'd bet , however , that the planners of the Miraval Resort , and its counterparts in Tucson and Phoenix , did make some efforts on their own to preserve the local landscape and it likely cost them more to do so . But I also contend it was done not in the spirit of environmentalism but because the Sonoran Desert landscape is a marketable amenity . Jeff Smyth Pinckneyville , IL BOGUS BOYCOTT BASHING I would like to comment on your article " Cutting with Conscience " ( May/June 1996 ) regarding the reasoning behind the certification of tropical forestry operations . It is important that the public not be confused by information that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which has originated from industry-supported " science . " Many certifiers seem to support industry-sponsored information calling into question the efficacy of boycotts . Having worked on many boycotts and having spent seven years working on a campaign promoting a selective boycott of tropical hardwoods in the U.S. , I would like to set the record straight . The boycott-bashing backlash by the industry began around 1988 , after groups such as Rainforest Action Network ( RAN ) had become highly effective at creating awareness of the problems associated with logging in the rain forests . The selective boycott of tropical hardwoods in the U.S. is not a " blanket " boycott , since all the major groups that work on or have worked on this campaign support independently certified wood . Yet , the certifiers and the industry still use this propaganda to promote their activities to a higher plane . I fully agree that certification is an absolutely essential piece in the puzzle toward sustainable logging . I disagree that boycotts are counterproductive . The truth is that we need to reduce our demand on tropical and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something on the order of one tenth of current U.S. levels of consumption-as well as promote sustainable harvests . There is no conflict between encouraging use of properly harvested products , and discouraging use of improperly harvested products . This should be obvious . Tim Keating Executive Director Rainforest Relief Red Bank , NJ SLUDGING THE SLUDGERS The article entitled The Sludging of America ( Currents , May/June 1996 ) does a huge disservice to thousands of consumers and land application programs around the country by suggesting that sewage solids recycling according to federal regulations is anything less than a safe , scientifically sound practice that is good for the environment . Over 40 years of research on the land application of properly treated and managed wastewater solids have demonstrated only positive effects , such as increased crop productivity and improved soil fertility . The current EPA regulations , finalized in 1993 , are the most comprehensive to date and are based on thorough , scientific health and environmental risk assessment . There has never been a documented negative human health effect reported from the appropriate land application of biosolids emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wastewater solids can be used in ways that are safe and can actually improve the environment . It would be a shame if your story damaged public perception of this important environmental practice . Albert C. Gray , Ph.D . Deputy Executive Director Water Environment Federation Alexandria , VA Editors Note : The key phrase in Dr. Gray 's assertions about biosolid safety is " appropriate land application . " Unfortunately , misapplication of these materials is quite widespread , and the many instances of illness cited in Es piece stemmed from that misuse . Dr. Gray might want to direct his considerable energies to ensuring that wastewater solids are carefully , not indiscriminately , spread on American cropland .
