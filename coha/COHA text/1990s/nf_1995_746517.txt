Our new international order is beginning to look like late nineteenth-century world politics . A hundred years ago , the great powers were locked in economic and political competition . Driven by economic gain , security , or power , they pursued tangible , not ideological , ends . They often maneuvered to counterbalance a rival 's ambitions through alliances or armaments . National interests counted for far more than governmental affinities . Hence , democracies and autocracies were at times pitted against their own while cooperating with their opposites in pursuit of their goals . <p> The United States , Britain , France , and Germany competed overseas for markets and resources . Russia and the Austro-Hungarian empire spread over land to secure borders , acquire territory , or expand spheres of influence . Their interests collided in frontier zones such as the dying Ottoman empire in southeastern Europe or in Asia and Africa . Clashes occurred in the Pacific , Central Asia , and the Balkans . The present seems to remember the past , because great-power rivalries are re-emerging . The cast of characters is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors are not that historically unfamiliar . THE RETURN OF HISTORY <p> To be sure , the modem global state system has different features than its nineteenth-century precursor . Telecommunications , electronic capital transfers , free trade agreements , weapons of mass destruction , and international organizations based on collective security  --  all seemingly separate our era from a century ago . Yet , often overlooked in this new world order is that capital flows existed in abundance before Word War I. More important , it is national policies that determine whether funds flow in or out of a state . The nation state still counts in our era of global markets . <p> Like the last decade of the twentieth century , the world of the 1890s witnessed a multipolar international order , relations regulated by power , accelerating world trade , perplexing economic connections , free international capital flows , strong national passions , regional arms races , and small-scale conflicts fought largely on the periphery for power , wealth , or ethno-nationalist ends . <p> Communism has been discredited in the intervening one-hundred-year period . But older and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly that , whatever the status of free markets and democracy , nationalism is far from obsolete . Nationalism stirs passions similar to those it aroused a hundred years ago . The Balkans are not the only example of this phenomenon . The tropical paradise of Sri Lanka is blood-soaked in ethnic violence . Ecuador and Peru fight over borders as do Egypt and the Sudan . The anti-immigrant feelings sweeping many Western countries , including the United States , are impelled by nationalistic as well as economic anxieties . Citizens fear a drop in their living standards brought on by destitute refugees seeking government handouts . But they also object to the dilution of their culture by immigrants who speak another language . <p> Our world has been disconnected from nineteenth-century international politics by a series of exceptional and unanticipated events  --  two world wars , Marxist revolutions , totalitarian regimes , and a protracted East-West ideological standoff . These anomalies have obscured from us the familiarity of what is a more natural international order of multiple competing states rather than two giant blocs frozen in confrontation . The solidarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to a world of many power centers . <p> As a result , relations among states have become less predictable . We will need to sometimes cooperate with and sometimes confront other great and lesser powers that pursue their own national interests . The international scene is returning to a chess match in which each individual piece  --  pawn , rook , or queen  --  has acquired a purpose of its own . Bloc politics are in retreat . GREAT POWERS , PAST AND PRESENT <p> Our contemporary international environment is dominated by many of the same great powers of the last century . Russia , Japan , Britain , France , Germany , and the United States influenced world politics as they do today , although with different geopolitical weight . The regions in which one or another predominates are so maddeningly disparate as to make most generalizations impossible . The one sure thing is that they are propelled by their own national agendas . <p> Russia 's imperial nature remains remarkably unchanged whether prosecuted by czar , commissar , or president . As in the past , Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions . The Soviet successor republics must take account of Moscow 's policies as they did before their incorporation into the USSR . Despite its current difficulties , Russia 's vast recuperative strength has often been underestimated . Its continued economic regeneration promises even more political sway . With a faltering democracy , several across-the-border interventions into Armenia and Afghanistan , war in Chechnya , and a nuclear capability second only to the United States , Moscow is as much a threat to Eurasian order today as under the Romanovs . The advent of Russian democracy , therefore , has not allayed the anxieties of the successor or satellite states . An authoritarian regime , if one comes to power , will only increase its neighbors ' apprehension of the Russian propensity to be a regional troublemaker . <p> Japan , now a peaceful economic superpower , remains feared by its neighbors , as it was in the previous century ; its World War II record has merely increased the sense of foreboding and resentment . Its ascendant economic prowess adds envy to anxiety in Korea and southeast Asia where Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among its former victims by stressing Asian values to counter Western economic and cultural encroachments . Tokyo preaches the superiority of its version of capitalism - national community and government intervention  --  over the U.S. model of individualism and unassisted private enterprise . But Asian countries retain their distinct characteristics and fears of foreign domination . <p> Britain and France still desire to play global roles , although their relative power has declined . They can influence actions in the Balkans or Europe but usually act in consultation with other states . Britain is able to project sea power across oceans against local combatants like Argentina in the Falklands war . With a lingering imperial legacy , Paris clings to its sphere of influence in Africa , where it can militarily intervene decisively as in Chad or Zaire . Despite being recent partners in the Persian Gulf War and allies for decades before the anti-Iraq coalition , British , French , and American policies have not meshed in resolving the Bosnian conflict . If anything , London and Paris have differed fundamentally from Washington 's hopes to lift the arms embargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellicosity of either the Kaiser 's or Hitler 's era . After completing East Germany 's reconstruction and with the diminished U.S. military presence , Berlin will , nevertheless , exert robust influence in continental affairs either singularly or through the European Union and various security organizations . The European Union could turn out to be a German-dominated superpower . Germany will more likely exert continental economic leadership in the near future , not political control . Berlin has already demonstrated a growing diplomatic independence from Washington . The passing of the Adenauer-inspired leaders , who have relied on U.S. consultation , will ensure a German-centered foreign policy . <p> The United States is much more dominant and engaged in world affairs than at the end of the previous century . But it is not as dominant as after 1945 ; nor is it as involved in world politics as during the Cold War . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , America has looked inward . reducing its military forces and shrinking its overseas policy horizons . Still , it remains the key player in world politics , albeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its vast superpower strength , the United States is viewed internationally as a lightweight political force . The Clinton White House appears at best uninterested in international affairs and at worst incapable of discerning American interests beyond commercial contracts or business advantages for select U.S. corporations . <p> Among newcomers to the center of the world stage , China has witnessed the most remarkable transformation in its fortunes . In the previous century , China was on the verge of colonial partition like Africa . World War I , as well as Sun Yatsen 's revolution , dashed and diverted European ambitions in China . Contemporary China has emerged as a great power , and one with global as well as regional aspirations . China 's spectacular economic growth and extensive military buildup have already cast a shadow over Asia . These twin factors will continue to affect the political calculations of its neighbors . Its two-thousand-mile claims of maritime sovereignty in the South China Sea and nationalistic bluster could bode ill for Asian harmony and U.S interests . <p> While neither the Middle East nor Islam are cohesive or powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious movement are certainly significant enough to be viewed as a major factor in a discussion of international rivalries . A century ago , Islam appeared to be in retreat ; today it is resurgent . Oil has provided an economic means for some Muslim states to become medium-weight powers . Others , such as Syria , were Soviet clients that Moscow armed and used in its global chessboard struggle with the United States . Because of the claims of Islam , the Muslim world is often given a unity by outsiders that in reality it lacks . In fact , the nationalism of Arab states militates against a Huntington-type clash of Islamic civilization with other world cultures. 1 Syria and Egypt , for example , contend for leadership in the Arab world . Iraq and Iran ( which is Muslim but not Arab ) contest for dominance in the Persian Gulf region . In short , nationalism and distinct historical experiences divide the region . <p> Still , Islamic-inspired and Muslim state-sponsored terrorism seems certain to continue to bedevil the West , particularly the United States , because of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virulent anti-Western Iran strives to rally the faithful in many lands against the satanic United States . Teheran 's religious claims serve as pretexts for its political and strategic designs . Its financial backing and religious militancy strike responsive chords among Muslim elements at home and abroad . Islamic militancy poses problems for France and Germany because of their large Muslim immigrant populations . <p> Fundamentalism also challenges moderate governments in North Africa . Should the besieged Egyptian and Algerian governments succumb to radical Islamic movements , then Europe 's southern flank would be in hostile hands for the first time since World War II . How such events would impact intra-regional relations among the states bordering the Mediterranean is hard to predict . Their exact influence on the domestic politics of European countries with sizable Muslim populations is also unclear . In the minds of some , such circumstances would also recall clashes between East and West some eight hundred years ago . But in actuality , the Middle East seems destined to retain its complexities . Its unsettled nature will likely test the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and U.S. interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , economic and political accomplishments are the highest in history . Latin America 's turn away from statist governments toward democratic practices and free markets heralds a new era south of the United States . The North American Free Trade Agreement marks a crossroads in hemispheric relations . By traveling down a better path , the United States and Latin America are poised for genuine regional cooperation and accelerated economic growth . It remains to be seen whether peasant rebellions and devaluation in Mexico or economic setbacks in Argentina are isolated setbacks or harbingers of a counter trend . The United States is still the predominate hemispheric power . But an economically advancing Latin America for the first time is capable of generating strong regional states that could contribute to a more complex interchange between Washington and its southern neighbors than the earlier part of this century saw . BACK TO THE FUTURE ? <p> What does this re-emergence of the great power architecture mean for the United States ? Does it mean a return to nineteenth-century diplomacy , ententes and alliances , secret treaties , divide-and-conquer schemes , nationalistic wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it represent a replay of history ? The short answer is yes and no . A longer response offers the observation that the next century will have political contours more like the nineteenth century than the present one . <p> The restoration of an international order based on a re-emergence of individual states signals a return to competition among great and regional powers ( such as Iran , Indonesia , India , and Brazil ) as they advance their own interests . Just as the end of the Cold War is witnessing the resurfacing of ethno-nationalism , it is also seeing an unraveling of restraints on national rivalties . <p> Competition ' today is largely economic . Scores are tallied in balance of payments figures , currency exchange rates , and comparative unemployment . History , which is an early warning system for the future , teaches that economic competition often turns adversarial . Political rivalry can result from contentions over access to resources and markets , disputes over intellectual property tights , governments pressured by citizens ' expectations of rising living standards or apprehensions of declining economic status . Economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Japanese-American trade friction exemplifies the phenomenon of economic competition becoming political . The recent standoff over Washington 's demands to sell more auto pans in Japan stemmed from a willingness in Washington and Tokyo to play to internal political constituencies . It also manifests the passing of an era when trade problems were minimized so as to present a united front to the Soviet Union . Washington formerly championed economic policies that built Western and Japanese prosperity as a bulwark against communism . Flush with some domestic and corporate support for its auto pans agreement with Tokyo , the Clinton administration plans to confront Korea and China on trade issues . If allowed to fester , trade friction can sour , even endanger , longstanding political or military alliances . <p> The American-Japanese trade dispute also derives from growing awareness that capitalism can possess differing characteristics . During the Cold War , we overlooked the distinctions in the pursuit of our grand alliance . Now , the Japanese view U.S. actions as bullying , and American critics interpret Tokyo 's policies as mercantilistic . They point to Japanese trade practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Japanese defenders hold that their brand of capitalism maximizes employment and production . The U.S. economy , on the other hand , emphasizes consumption and financial returns to investors . That national characteristics as well as government policies account for variants in capitalist economies is becoming a familiar part of the post-Cold War landscape . <p> Rivalties between states can be provoked by the passions of nationalism that on-the-make politicians then seize upon to rise to power . In Russia and Serbia , the nationalist card is played because political leaders lack economic means to improve living standards . Unemployment is often blamed on foreign competition . Economic downturns could see the nationalist trump used more widely to secure or hold onto political office . Economic growth is important , for rarely in history has economic strength not been translated into political power . So far , modern-day Japan and Germany are exceptions . But few would expect this geo-economic aberration to persist indefinitely . WHAT IS TO BE DONE ? <p> What do political competition , growing nationalism , and international ambition mean for the new diplomacy ? As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less predictable order . Then as now , changes in a state 's power must be scrutinized . Since a nation 's intentions can change with its leadership , its capabilities must constantly be assessed . Ideological considerations are rendered unimportant in the emerging great power competition . <p> Past statesmen calculated the impact on the power balance when a rival power increased its strength through military buildup , territorial acquisition , or security alliance . Change upset the balance-of-power among states , which often regulated international relations and checked aggressive ambitions . The balance-of-power calculus played a central role in the formulation and implementation of foreign policy for centuries . Hegemonic maneuvers by France or Germany in years past , for example , set off alarm bells in the foreign ministries of European capitals as they weighed the implications for their own security and interests . Even during the Cold War , Soviet actions , whether in ams buildups or expanded influence , were viewed through the prism of power relations . <p> In the post-Cold War era , Washington must assess its objectives from the perspective of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World seeking to contain communism . Americans have been slow to acknowledge the importance of national necessity in the pursuit of foreign policy . President Bush had to justify U.S. opposition to Iraq as resisting aggression against undemocratic Kuwait rather than as maintaining an uninterrupted flow of oil from the Persian Gulf . Because of our traditions , America will never practice a pure realpolitik ; but moral convictions alone can not determine our actions . <p> We must now reckon with power shifts in regions critical to our interests . The United States fought two hot global wars and pursued the Cold War in large measure to keep Europe and Asia from coming under the domination of a single hegemon . During the Soviet-American confrontation , Washington played the role of extra-regional balancer in Europe by participation in NATO and in Asia by military bases in and defense commitments to Japan and South Korea . <p> A dangerous concentration of power in vital areas from expanded military strength , such as the acquisition of mass-destruction weapons , should at least raise the question , does it threaten the balance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take counter measures . <p> These may include advancing diplomatic , economic , or military support to bolstering a local counterweight ; forming an area security organization ; or establishing regional military . deterrence . Failing to restore the balance-of-power in strategic regions will allow power vacuums to develop and to tempt fate , as happened in the 1930s when Nazi Germany and militaristic Japan unleashed their territorial expansion . <p> To be specific , the Clinton administration can not : ignore a nuclear Iran or , North Korea . It must address the seriousness of power disequilibriums when nuclear weapons proliferate to regimes like Pyongyang or Teheran , which threaten loyal allies like South Korea and Israel as well as U.S. economic interests or energy reserves . The United States-North Korea nuclear agreement can not be verified by independent means . It also establishes the wrong international precedent because it can be used to justify the sale of atomic technology . Russian officials have cited the accord to lend credibility to their transfer of nuclear equipment to Iran . An Iranian nuclear capacity will distort the intra-regional Middle East political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with dangerous power imbalances . It can exert pressure ( if it has the will ) for strictly enforced sanctions or international disapproval to dissuade a hostile state from acquiring mass-destruction arms . If these fail , it can contemplate covert operations run by political dissidents or even overt U.S. military measures , alone or together with allies . Nuclear proliferation is too important an issue to be swept from the U.S. election scene by a poor accord , as was the case this past October . The Geneva agreement with North Korea , in fact , allows Pyongyang to maintain its nuclear capability , relying on promises from a regime that broke its pledge embodied in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty . <p> Nor can Washington ignore China 's steady military ascent or Russia 's post-imperial reach . The recent U.S. military accord with India constitutes a positive step to balance China 's growing power . So does Clinton 's diplomatic normalization with Vietnam despite Hanoi 's less than satisfactory resolution of the POW/MIA issue . Vietnamese membership in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will also strengthen it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military and political power of Beijing and Tokyo with the ASEAN states ( Indonesia , Malaysia , Philippines , Singapore , Thailand , and now Vietnam ) will demand strategic vision and sophisticated appreciation of genuine American interests . <p> A direct containment of China is not in the interest of the United States . Because of China 's proximity arid power , confronting Beijing would force Asian states to dissociate themselves with the United States . The Clinton administration 's handling of Sino-American relations , particularly the effort to publicly embarrass China over human rights dating from Bill Clinton 's presidential campaign , works against humanitarian and strategic goals . <p> Along with balancing Chinese and Japanese power , Washington 's policy must be to integrate China into the world political system . Washington must let Beijing know that a prosperous and stable China is also in the U.S. interest . This would help place the Sino-American relationship in a context other than just human rights and copyright disputes . Even China can see a role for U.S. regional involvement as Beijing deals with Japan , Russia , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and South Korea is essential . Without Beijing 's engagement , the two Koreas will remain divided . <p> For the same equilibrium reasons , the United States should take into account Japan 's capacity to be a high-tech military superpower . During the Cold War , Japan relied on Washington for defense , abandoning its historic self-reliance . Confronted by increased naval and military capabilities in China and Korea , Japan is reconsidering its prior dependence . Its defense budget already hovers between the world 's second and third largest , depending on the true state of Russia 's spending for armaments . And increases are planned . Just as in Germany , the passing of the post-World War II generation is witnessing a Japan increasingly independent from Washington . <p> An assert:tee and aggressively armed Japan-would change the context of our larger Asian and global security structure . At this juncture , it is difficult to foresee whether Japan or China will pose the greater challenge to American interests in Asia . A strategy of putting together a countervailing coalition against a potential threat is one prescription . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balancing opportunity between the two powers . Another approach is to develop the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum as a means to allay tensions and resolve historic enmities . The two are not mutually exclusive . But the distinctiveness and competition of Asian countries work at least for the present against a close community organization along the lines of the European Union . <p> The role left for the United States is to remain militarily based in Japan and Korea so as to ensure the moderation of Asian offensive capabilities . This will reassure Tokyo and its neighbors that any Japanese stepped-up weapons outlays are unnecessary . The presence of a U.S. safety net reduces mutual suspicions . America 's military linked to Japan 's defense force is reassuring to both China and Japan . <p> Across the globe , Washington must also push for the extension of the Western security alliance into Central Europe ; this will stabilize the region and help to limit future Russian moves westward . The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has become as much a political alliance as a military one . It could also help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bosnian tragedy . <p> NATO membership will further consolidate democracy and market economies in Poland , Hungary , Slovakia , and the Czech Republic . Placing all our chips on successful Russian conversion is too risky a strategy . Extending NATO eastward also reassures the four Central European states that a reunited Germany or a resurgent Russia will not replay history . For over two hundred years , Central European countries have been caught between Berlin and Moscow , each bent on absorbing , partitioning , or dominating them . <p> Historic opportunities await the United States to its south . By broadening free trade agreements in Latin America beyond Mexico and Chile , the United States can strengthen the course initiated by NAFTA and the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs . Such policies will not only integrate Latin American participation into global economic development but also act as insurance against the rise of restrictive trade blocs beyond the Western hemisphere . A hemispheric cooperative could forestall the possible adoption of restrictive barriers by European and Asian regional trade blocs . <p> Encouraging economic liberalization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy goals to pursue ; but we must not bank on their success alone to serve American interests . Democratic failures in Russia or setbacks to economic reform in China will provide warnings for future problems . After all , Germany and Japan were both democracies in the 1920s ; ten years later their dictators embarked on military conquests . But even under the best circumstances , great powers will retain their respective agendas . <p> A hundred years ago , the interests of democratic France , Britain , and the United States clashed in Venezuela , Africa , China , and the Pacific . The re-emergence of great power rivalries makes political competition and the collision of interests likely among states . The similarities in their economic and political systems will not guarantee a suspension of competition . Russia 's and China 's liberalization will not ensure perfect-harmony with other states . Neither monarchies nor republics kept past ages war-free . National interests count for more than economic and political affinities . <p> International trade , regional economic integration , collective security organizations , peace pacts , humanitarian missions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent the reoccurrence of major wars . None have proved to be fool-proof guarantees . If we are to protect American interests , the United States must stay engaged diplomatically , prepared militarily , and ready to act to rebalance power disequilibriums . Idealism will not suffice to transform historic realities . While President Woodrow Wilson 's idealism continues to impact America 's international values , the United States must be guided by considerations of power and necessity . With the return of competition among great and medium powers to the international order , we are poised for a return of history . not its end . NOTE <p> 1 . Samuel P. Huntington , " The Clash of Civilizations ? " Foreign Affairs , 72 ( July/August 1993 ) : 30-49 . In a lead essay , Professor Huntington put forth a provocative argument that tensions and conflicts would be between entire civilizations in the post-Cold War world . Clashes , therefore , would take place among Hindu , Muslim , Slavic Orthodox , Western , Japanese , Confucian , Latin American , and possibly African civilizations . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associate director of the Hoover Institution on War , Revolution and Peace , Stanford , California . <p>
