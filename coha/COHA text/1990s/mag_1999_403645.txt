GHB is clear and nearly tasteless-and one dose in your drink can leave you utterly defenseless against sexual assault . Rapists know about it . So should you . // When she woke up , Julie Simmons* could n't figure out how she 'd made it back to her house in Los Angeles . She looked down . She was naked , but she did n't recall getting undressed . All she remembered was having dinner in her date 's apartment and then falling asleep on his couch . When she called him , he told her that she 'd had too much to drink the night before and he had driven her home . That struck her as odd-she knew she 'd only had a couple of beers-but she believed him . What choice did she have ? Two weeks later , Julie slipped in the shower and hit her hands on the floor . The cold slap of the tile jarred loose a memory too horrible for her to comprehend : She was on her hands and knees on the bathroom floor as her date stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory was vivid and undeniable . Julie had been raped and , until that moment , she had n't even remembered it . When a woman thinks of rape , she usually pictures a burly stranger with a knife dragging her into a poorly lit parking lot or behind a bush . When she considers date rape , she pictures a guy she likes but does not know too well suddenly pinning her down , refusing to hear her nos . But an insidious new weapon at the potential rapist 's disposal makes force unnecessary . It 's clear , it 's liquid , and an eyedropperful , slipped into a drink when you 're momentarily distracted , can knock you cold in a matter of minutes . The drug is gamma hydroxybutyrate-also known as GHB , Grievous Bodily Harm , or Easy Lay . " Two years ago , this drug wasnt ' really even on the radar screen , " says Trinka Porrata , a detective supervisor in the Los Angeles Police Department narcotics division and a nationally known expert on designer dmgs . " Now it 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of slowing down . " In fact , the Drug Enforcement Administration attributes 32 deaths and 3,500 incidents , including overdoses , to GHB since 1992 . The official numbers probably do n't reflect the real scope of the drug . GHB leaves the body after 12 hours , so many suspected cases ca n't positively be pinned to it ; it 's also new enough that many emergency rooms fail to recognize it when a rape victim comes in . " But just judging from the activity over the past two years , this drug is on the brink of taking over , " says Porrata . And it 's everywhere . " It 's happening in restaurants , at parties , in clubs , on dates , in people 's homes , " says Cynthia Peterson , victim 's services director at the Contra Costa Rape Crisis Center in San Pablo , California . " Anyplace where there 's social interaction , GHB could be there . " GHB 'S SCARY WEB SPREAD Slipping a girl a mickey is certainly nothing new , and GHB is hardly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently , Rohypnol , aka roofies , was getting all the press . But one twist makes GHB much scarier than roofies : Unlike Rohypnol , which can only be manufactured commercially , GHB is easily produced at home-and anyone with Internet access can find a way to buy both the recipe and the kit with which to cook up a batch . " The recipe for Toll House Cookies is more difficult , " says Robert S. Hoffman , M.D. , a toxicologist at New York City 's Poison Control Center . In addition , GHB is virtually undetectable once it 's in your drink . It 's clear and dissolves quickly , and its slightly salty taste is easily masked by a strong or flavorful drink like a margarita or a Long Island iced tea . ( By contrast , Rohypnol 's maker , Hoffman-La Roche , recently reformulated Rohypnol to turn blue when it hits clear liquid . ) Because GHB is home-brewed , its potency can vary wildly from batch to batch . This means even a single dose can prove deadly . " The people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are amateur chemists , " says Dr. Hoffman . " But what they do n't realize is that the formulas are n't exact , and the amount that simply intoxicated someone the first time can just as easily kill the next . " In 1996 in Texas , for instance , a 17-year-old woman died at a nightclub after consuming a soft drink laced with GHB . In Georgia , a young woman lapsed into a coma after unknowingly swigging GHB mixed with water . " ALL IT TOOK WAS ONE DRINK ... " Far more often , GHB poisoning does n't end awoman 's life-it just changes it for good . " It felt like an out-of-body experience , " says Andrea Jeffries of an encounter with the drug that began on January 30,1997 , when she was a23-yearold student living in Southern California . According to Jeffries , her date , a 35-yearold man who said he was younger , pressed her hard to do the shot he had brought over from the bar . " Immediately , I felt buzzed , " says Jeffries . " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my chair . It was like I was very drunk , but it did n't make any sense because I had had only one drink . " Soon after she noticed those signs , she blacked out . Photograph // She recalls slipping in and out of consciousness throughout the night until she finally awoke on the floor of a dingy shower in her date 's apartment with hot water beating down on her . She was naked , lying in the fetal position . " I remember him coming into the bathroom , " says Jeffries . He was completely naked and forced her to perform oral sex . " It was like everything was in slow motion , " she recalls . " He was trying to push himself in my mouth , but I kept thrashing my head back and forth to make him stop . " She blacked out again , and when she came to , she was being anally raped . " lie was holding me dowvn by my neck , and I was screaming , " says Jeffries . " When he was finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As the effects of the drug began to wear off , Jeffries was able to grab a cordless phone and lock herself in the bathroom to call the police . As she cowered in the bathroom pleading to the 911 operator , the man ripped the phone unit out of the wall and began ramming the door . Moments after he burst in , the police arrived and were able to usher Jeffries to safety . During her rape examination , the hospital failed to test her urine-the only conclusive way to detect GHB in the body . But the symptoms sounded all too familiar to prosecutors , who landed a conviction on felony rape charges . The man was sentenced to three years in prison , but Jeffries is still living with the terror of that night . " I 'm not the same person I was before , " she says . - All it took was one drink and my life was changed forever . " FROM HEALTH PILL TO RAPIST 'S TOOL GHB 's path into the hands of sex abusers has been pretty short . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sleep aid and bodybuilding supplement under names like Gamma Hydrate , Natural Sleep-500 , and Somatomax PM . After several complaints of adverse effects , the FDA pulled the drug from shelves in 1990-but it was too late . GHB was already being produced illegally and quickly gained momentum in California and Florida as a party drug . The word among clubgoers was that it reproduced the euphoria of alcohol without giving users alcohol 's wicked hangovers . It also gained a reputation for peeling away inhibitions in a hurry . Strippers often turn to the drug if they 're nervous about performing , says Porrata . The first cases of GHB-related sexual assault were reported in those states around 1996 . But after recipes showed up on the Internet , other regions of the country quickly caught up . WHY PROSECUTORS HATE THIS DRUG Although law-enforcement officials are getting more adept at recognizing a GHB rape case when they see one , another characteristic of the drug makes these cases pretty tough to prosecute : It 's a serious sexual stimulant . Says Porrata , " You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing all over the guy " or exp ) eriencing a loss of inhibitions some other way . Porrata cites a case in wllich a woman was secretly slipped the drug while out at a club with a female friend . " The victim said that after only one drink , she started to feel really silly and could n't figure out how she was getting so drink so fast . Before she knew it , she was all over her friend in front of everyone at the bar . " By the end of the night , the victim had been raped by the man who drugged her , but she was too confised to report it ; she remembered only bits and pieces of the assault by the rapist but recalled most of the episode with her friend . " She was so embarrassed that she did n't want to come forward , " says Porrata . " She could n't understaid her behavior tmd she thought she was at fault , when in fact she was under the influence of GHB. " // HOW TO SPIKEPROOF YOUR DRINK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish fly that I can think of , " says Bob Nichols , assistant state attorney of the sex-crimes unit in Broward County Florida , and an expert in drug-related sexual assault . " GHB can remove the impulse control that stops a woman from having sex with a stranger . " " Ifyou are incapacitated and ca n't make a judgment call , that does not give someone the right to rape you , " Porrata adds . " But the effects of this drug complicate the issues ; there 's no question . " PROTECTING YOURSELFBEFORE AND AFTER * Drug rapists are slippery , but you can outsmart them . You ca n't pick the GHB rapist out in a crowded bar-he could be any guy . Nichols says assailants often work in tandem . Knowing this can help you , but not always-unfortunately , one of the pair may be the bartender . Or the two men may pretend not to know each other . * If you 've been poisoned with a typical dose of GHB-one or two tablespoonsthe drug will take effect within 10 to 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nauseous or develop a severe headache . You may already be too incapacitated by then to seek help , so always try to have a friend watching your back when you go out . Many GHB rapists wait until their victim shows visible signs that the drug is taking hold and then offer to " help " by escorting her out . * If you wake up in a strange place , in different clothes , or naked and you suspect you 've been drugged and sexually assaulted , go immediately to the hospital . Do n't bathe , brush your teeth , drink , wash your face , or urinate . " If you really have to go , save the urine and bring it with you to the hospital , " says Nichols . " We have a 12-hour window to test for GHB in urine , and if you use the bathroom before we can conduct a test , the evidence is flushed down the toilet .

" We may still be able to prosecute your case through a reconstruction of events , " says Linda Fairstein , chief of the sex-crimes prosecution unit at the district attorney 's office in Manhattan . " It takes a lot of courage to report a rape , " adds Robert Lipman , senior attorney with the Narcotics and Dangerous Drug section of the U.S. Department of Justice , " but the guys who use drugs to incapacitate women are often serial rapists , and the only way to stop them is for the victims to come forward . " Denise Snyder , executive director of the D.C. Rape Crisis Center in Washington , takes a harder line . " The real people who should be carrying the burden of responsibility are the perpetrators , " she argues . " Men who mix sex with violence should be held accountable on every level until we can uproot the types of sexual attitudes that lead to these crimes . " But until that happens , keep an eye on your drink.Ea Sidebar THE DATERAPE DRUG YOU TAKE YOURSELF Despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number-one date-rape drug is n't GHB or roofies . It 's alcohol . Whether lured by a false sense of security or a macho sense of entitlement , women everywhere are holding their own when it comes to bellying up to the barwith devastating consequences . And according to various victim-counseling centers and law-enforcement agencies , reports of sexual assault in relation to binge drinking ( five drinks or more ) are on the rise . In fact , a 1989 study revealed that nearly 3 out of 4 women who were victims of sexual assault had been using alcohol at the time of the incident . In another , earlier study . 1 in 5 admitted they had been moderately or extremely intoxicated . Obviously , this does n't mean a man has a right to have sex with you without your consent . But drinking , and especially binge drinking , does put you in far greater danger of being attacked and makes prosecuting your attacker much more problematic .

" But even if you were drunk , Fairstein emphasizes you should always make a report . " We may be able to reconstruct the events to build a case against your rapist . " And if you do n't report it , he 'll get away with it-and probably do it again . Footnote * 1ome names have been changed . // <p>
