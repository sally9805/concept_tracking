<p> So , Toni Morrison . <p> You 're the first writer in English since Hemingway to win the Nobel Prize and yet be firmly anchored in mass culture  --  to have your work stacked up in warehouse discount clubs and New Jersey Turnpike rest stops . <p> At 66 , you 're at the peak of your powers . Your best-known novel , Beloved , will be released as a big-budget movie this fall , undoubtedly sparking a re-examination of slavery that will make the noise over " Amistad " seem muted . <p> Another of your books , Tar Baby , is about to go before camera this spring ( Wesley Snipes is in talks to star ) . <p> You receive more requests to lecture , to be interviewed , to participate on panels and attend conferences , to receive honorary degrees and serve on government commissions , than a whole shelf of writers . <p> No other contemporary writer has your formidable presence , your moral authority . But are you happy ? Morrison laughs and sighs at the same time . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a croissant in her office at the university here . " What is all this running around after happiness ? It 's very American , and very boring . Why do n't we just do something constructive , something creative , and then if that makes us happy , fine . <p> " If it does n't , at least we still have tilled the garden , baked the bread , took care of somebody who could n't take care of themselves , written the book . . . " <p> Written the book , yes . Morrison 's seventh novel , her first since the Nobel , is in bookstores . This is the novel as cultural event : Everyone will review it ; " 60 Minutes " is doing a segment ; other television shows are lining up . The publisher expects to sell hundreds of thousands of copies in the next few weeks . <p> The critics will decide if Paradise ( Knopf , $ 25 ) is Morrison 's best book , but it 's a safe bet none will call it her simplest . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be tempting to say this is a major novelist 's take on what is frequently billed as the major issue confronting America today . Except for one thing : The whole point of the novel is to ignore race . <p> " They shoot the white girl first . " That 's the blunt first sentence of Paradise , but a chasm separates these six words from the rest of the novel , which never mentions race so directly again . <p> " They " are the men from the isolated hamlet of Ruby , convinced that a handful of free-spirited women living in a former convent are the source of all their troubles . The proud history of Ruby is given , as is the background of each of the women . At the end , the story circles back to the rampaging men . Only a very clever reader will figure out which of the women is the white girl . The others are black . <p> Morrison explains what she is up to : " The tradition in writing is that if you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any deviation from that , you have to say . What I wanted to do was not erase race , but force readers either to care about it or see if it disturbs them that they do n't know . Does it interfere with the story ? Does it make you uncomfortable ? Or do I succeed in making the characters so clear , their interior lives so distinctive , that you realize ( a ) it does n't matter , and ( b ) more important , that when you know their race , it 's the least amount of information to know about a person . " <p> It 's possible to read Paradise as exploring several sharp conflicts : the religious town vs. the " pagan " convent , those who worship money vs. those who do n't , the Ruby men vs. the convent women . <p> Morrison insists : " I do n't have an agenda . All I have are questions . " <p> Which leads to her biggest worry about the book 's reception . Ruby is an all-black community , a town that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the perceived threat to this security , the attempt to make sure " nothing inside or out rots the one all-black town worth the pain , " that leads the men to attack the women . <p> " I 'm fearful they 'll talk about it as a book about racist black people , " she says . " You think they 'll do that to me ? " <p> In her soul , Morrison is Chloe Anthony Wofford . The name by which she 's known everywhere came about casually , unwillingly . Toni is a nickname ; Morrison arrived with her marriage to Jamaican architecture student Harold Morrison . When she saw the first copies of her first novel , The Bluest Eye , in 1970 , she was upset , but it was too late to change the cover . A nickname and a long-defunct marriage had combined to form the official her . <p> Before the books and acclaim was a childhood in Lorain , Ohio . Morrison was born in 1931 to George Wofford , a ship welder , and his wife , Ramah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where they were given some land by the government during Reconstruction , lost it and were reduced to the miserable life of sharecroppers . <p> Around 1910 , Morrison 's grandfather decided to go to the big city  --  Birmingham  --  to earn his living by playing the violin in streets and clubs . Her grandmother was uneasy out in the country with a couple of growing daughters and no man . <p> Grandma sent her husband a message : " We 're heading north on the midnight train . If you ever want to see us again , you 'll be on that train . " He was . After a brief sojourn in Kentucky , the family went to Ohio . <p> Morrison 's grandparents were poor , and her parents were n't much better off . But then , it mattered less . " In my youth , during the Depression , rich people had to explain themselves , tell how they got that way . Poor people , first- and second-generation immigrants and particularly black people , felt they had the moral high ground . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She majored in English at Howard University and got a graduate degree from Cornell . In the early ' 60s , she had a full plate : back at Howard as a teacher , married , the mother of a young child with another on the way . But the marriage was unhappy , and she joined a writing group . In 1965 , she went to work editing textbooks . The novels soon followed . <p> If you take poverty , music , brave women , deep roots in the Midwest and the changes wrought by the ' 60s , you get a few of the elements that formed the novelist and make up Paradise . <p> The women who end up in the convent in Paradise are fleeing troubled , poor backgrounds . They 're women , as Morrison writes , " who chose themselves for company . " But the men of Ruby understand that the American dream is secured with land , with wealth . They see the women as freeloading . Says Morrison : " They begin to do what men frequently do when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their babies  --  whether they 're having them or not having them . Reproductive organs become the focus . " <p> All this can make the novel sound schematic , or reductive , or a simple allegory , or no fun at all . The fact that none of this is true is due to Morrison 's art . Which does n't mean that it is n't going to be controversial . Morrison , though , is no stranger to controversy . Most recently , her Song of Solomon was removed from classrooms in St. Mary 's County , Maryland , when some parents deemed it inappropriate for study . <p> " It 's a serious issue among black writers and black artists whether narratives should be romanticized or have the characters presented with ' best foot forward . ' It 's not a trivial argument , but I happen to believe that if you reveal the complicated lives of black people in all their intricacies , their layered lives , that is much more powerful and regenerative as art than reducing or limiting African American characters to caricatures . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the task of building paradise . Words can inflame as easily as soothe , threaten as well as cajole . <p> " I am suggesting that we are the only humans there are . . . . We are the only ones who can imagine paradise , so let 's start imagining it properly , so that it is n't about my way , my land , my borders , my values . . . . We 're the only ones who can do that . So  --  think it up . " <p> These days , talk too earnestly of creating the kingdom of Heaven here on Earth and people will think you daft . Morrison is calm , regal , assured . <p> " Yes , " she says . " The chances of paradise are small . So what ? "
