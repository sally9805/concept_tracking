<p> Is he back ? <p> Not just back playing the game , but back as one of the greatest to play the game ? <p> It is a question that has followed Michael Jordan since he decided to come back to the Bulls late last season , especially because his return was n't as spectacular as some had wished . <p> Sure , he turned some heads when he torched the New York Knicks for 55 points in the fifth game of his comeback , but that proved to be just a tease . <p> In the 17 regular-season games he played last season , of which the Bulls won 13 , Jordan shot 80 percent from the free-throw line and 41.1 percent from the field , both career-low marks . And the 26.9 points he averaged was his lowest in nine years , surpassing only the 22.7 points he averaged when a broken foot sidelined him for 64 games in his second season . <p> When the playoffs came , Jordan still found himself out of sync . Though he averaged 31.5 points in 10 playoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least two games and figured prominently in their elimination by the Orlando Magic . <p> Some people just shook their heads and wrote him off as a has-been , an aging superstar past his prime and incapable of retrieving the skill and will that crowned him as the king of the game . <p> Is that true ? <p> Well , there are certain times when people can stop and chart his return , monitor his progress , check to see if he indeed continues to improve and regain the form he had before he left the game . <p> And this is one of those times because the game Friday against the San Antonio Spurs marked the 17th game Jordan played this season . <p> So how 's he doing ? <p> " I feel I 'm pretty much all the way back now as a player , " Jordan said . " My skills are there . So is my confidence . Now it 's just a matter of me going out and playing the way I 'm capable every night . " <p> Something he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , made people wonder whether the Air had gone out of his game during his 17-month sabbatical . <p> " I made a mistake , " Jordan said after the Bulls were eliminated from the playoffs last spring . " I tried to do too much in too little time . " <p> Now it 's just like old times . <p> He once again is leading the NBA in scoring and is positioned <p> for a record eighth scoring title . He 's also the primary reason the Bulls are off to their best start in history . They went into Saturday 's game at Milwaukee with the league 's best record . <p> His numbers : 29.4 points , 4.9 assists , 5.3 rebounds and 2.2 turnovers per game . <p> " This is a great time for me , " Jordan said . " When you win and you play good , I think that 's fun . If you 've worked hard all summer so that you could blossom now , then you do it , that 's even more fun . " <p> A lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last year when he came back , it was all hype , " Bulls guard Ron Harper said . " Everybody put hype on him . And do you want to know what I think ? Michael got caught up in that hype . Honest . He got caught up in his own hype where he felt he had to do so much to carry us and to meet other people 's unrealistic expectations . He tried , but he was n't able to do it . " <p> " He was unfair to himself , really , " said Bulls forward Scottie Pippen , whom Jordan calls the <p> team 's primary leader . " He tried to do too much too soon with a different team that was a lot worse than the one he left . And most of that team did n't even know him . " <p> Jordan not only lost some games , he lost something more precious . He lost some personal pride , which fuels his game . That 's why he said he dedicated himself to playing more basketball than ever last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grover . <p> " I 've never seen anybody work harder than Michael Jordan did , " Grover said . " He fulfilled his normal summer obligations  --  shooting commercials , making some personal appearances  --  and he shot a movie . But his conditioning program always remained his primary objective . " <p> " I 'm the kind of person who thrives on challenges , and I took pride in people saying I was the best player in the game , " Jordan said . " But when I left the game , I fell down in the ratings . Down , I feel , below people like Shaquille O'Neal , Hakeem Olajuwon , Scottie Pippen , Da <p> vid Robinson and Charles Barkley . I came back because I wanted to become No. 1 again . <p> " That 's why I committed myself to going through a whole training camp , playing every preseason game and playing every regular-season game . At my age , I have to work harder . I ca n't afford to cut corners . So this time , I plan to go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt . " <p> " If he 's lost anything , I ca n't see it , " Spurs guard Doc Rivers said . <p> Jordan will turn 33 before this season ends . But he says that because of good conditioning , he feels as good now as he did before he retired . <p> Still , age has a way of catching up to everyone . His game has been slightly altered for the sake of energy conservation . Perhaps this is in deference to his age and his effort to minimize the incidence of injury . Jordan always has been revered as a player who had a high pain threshold and quick recuperative powers . <p> " Between games , Jordan can bounce back from injuries that would sideline other players for weeks , " Bulls trainer Chip Schaefer said . " He has a remarkable body . " <p> " A lot of it is a mind thing , " Jordan has said . " You just wipe minor pain out of your mind and play through some injuries . " <p> One ca n't help but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more prone to pull up for a perimeter jumper . He also has taken more to posting up players . <p> The bottom line is that his increased use of the jump shot spares him the trauma of having defenders beat on him when he drives . He still has the quickness to go in and dunk without being pounded too much , but Jordan is bracing himself for the protracted campaign and avoiding unnecessary beatings so that he can have more energy for the playoffs , when it will count the most . <p> And he will need every ounce of that energy , especially against the young Magic . <p> In the teams ' first meeting this season , Jordan was outplayed by Anfernee Hardaway , the player many feel is ready to surpass him as the game 's best all-around player . Hardaway finished with a game-high 36 points ; Jordan had 23 . <p> " Give Penny credit , " Jordan said after the game . " He shot the ball well and did a good job of carrying his team on his shoulders offensively . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is doing more and more as the season wears on . He says he especially enjoyed the recent seven-game road trip , on which he averaged 32.7 points in leading the Bulls to a 6-1 record . <p> " As far as I 'm concerned , he 's still one of the best in the game , " Dallas Mavericks guard Jason Kidd said . " He still finds a way to win . " <p> He found a way on that trip . It was as if Jordan had taken his show on the road to prove he is back . Not just back , but back . <p> Consider : <p> He scored 15 points in the last 3:37 to preserve a 90-85 victory against the Utah Jazz . <p> He scored 19 points in the last 6:05 to rally the Bulls to victory against the expansion Vancouver Grizzlies . <p> Against the Portland Trail Blazers , he had 14 fourth-quarter points to preserve a victory . <p> " I 'm old , " Jordan said . " Age-wise , I think I 'm old . But skill-wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of basketball I know I can play . I think . . . the question ( people ) end up asking me the most is how do I compare the two players : the one before baseball and the one after I quit ( baseball ) . <p> " Quite frankly , I think they are the same . It 's just a matter of putting out the stats to show that they are the same . And I think that by the end of the year , hopefully , you will see that it 's basically the same player with two years in between . " @x PARIS -- Across the French countryside , within sight of villages and towns , thick clouds of steam rise from giant cooling towers at 58 nuclear energy plants that provide more than three quarters of the nation 's electricity . In this , France far outpaces other countries , with Japan second at about 34 percent of its electricity . Nuclear power supplies about 20 percent of the electricity in the United States , where public anxieties and high costs have prevented construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of a poster child for nuclear power . Now , around the world , nuclear power is getting a fresh look as an alternative to using oil , natural gas , and coal that produce climate-changing carbon emissions . And the French government sees an opportunity . It is preparing to build a new generation of reactors and to step up sales abroad of its technology . " France has become one of the leading countries capable of exporting technology around the world , " says Luis E. Echvarri , the director general of the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . It is , he adds , " in a very strong position . " While France 's heavy dependence on nuclear power has been popular -- seen as a source of jobs and a safeguard against energy shortages -- that view is being challenged . Opponents are warning that the new nuclear plants are too costly and will produce more dangerous waste that contains significantly higher levels of radioactive material . It 's not clear whether such opposition will hinder the government 's plans . Public acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics say , was less a vote of public support than a failure in the French political system . " Nobody asked the French people what they thought , " remarks Jean-Philippe Desbordes , author of Atomic Park , a book critical of the French program . " France is much less democratic than the United States . " That 's not entirely true , since polls over the years consistently have shown public support , in no small part owing to the active encouragement of the government . France 's ambitious nuclear energy program was first established by Gen. Charles de Gaulle in 1958 , but it was not until the 1973 oil shock that nuclear power became a national priority . The first plants built by the nationalized electricity company Electricit de France , known as EDF , were based on American technology under license from Westinghouse . But France has since become a major developer and exporter of nuclear energy technology . Today , the French nuclear program is making a new growth push . In January , President Nicolas Sarkozy announced the construction of a new-generation European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern France . The project is expected to employ some 2,000 workers during the five-year construction period and cost $2.3 billion . The new reactor will be more powerful than any currently in commercial use . It will consume 15 percent less uranium while producing 30 percent less nuclear waste . The waste , however , will be considerably more radioactive than that produced by older reactors . The decision to build the Penly plant was quickly challenged by environmentalists , who say high levels ofradioactivity from the new plant will pose a serious health risk to workers and that nuclear waste will have to be stored above ground for a longer period than has been the case to date . " Despite the French government 's global marketing of its flagship European Pressurized Reactor as cheap and safe , " the environmental group Greenpeace said in a statement , " nuclear energy is rapidly becoming the most expensive way to produce electricity , and its highly radioactive waste poses an ever- increasing problem . " In announcing the construction of the Penly plant , the second in the series , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade potential foreign clients to import the technology . Although no EPRs are now operating , two are currently under construction , one in Finland at Olkiluoto and the other in Flamanville in France 's Normandy region . The Finnish reactor has faced serious construction problems , including flawed pipes and waterlogged concrete , that have delayed its original April 2009 completion date by three years and led to cost overruns of 50 percent . A world marketplace . France is aggressively pursuing a worldwide market . In September , EDF bought British Energy , the leading nuclear energy company in the United Kingdom , for 12.5 billion pounds ( $23.2 billion at the time of the announcement ) . In December , EDF announced it would invest $4.5 billion to increase its share in the American firm Constellation Energy Nuclear Group from 9.5 percent to just under 50 percent . In February , the French government-controlled engineering giant Areva , the world 's biggest nuclear power plant construction company , announced it would build at least two , and perhaps six , EPR nuclear reactors in India . Officials say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being built take into account the disastrous explosion at the Soviet Union 's Chernobyl reactor in 1986 ( as well as the Three Mile Island incident in Pennsylvania in 1979 ) through a safeguarded system that cools the heart of the reactor . The reactors are surrounded by a protective layer of reinforced concrete that can allegedly withstand the impact of a wide-body jetliner . " It took years for people to realize that the lesson from Chernobyl was learned , " says Echvarri of the Nuclear Energy Agency . " It has taken time to build that confidence . " The French nuclear program is based on three key ideas : centralized management , close cooperation among the key industrial players and the government , and the recycling of nuclear waste . By applying the same technology to all of its nuclear plants -- as opposed to the United States , where some 80 different plant designs currently exist -- France has significantly cut both construction costs and the time needed to obtain building permits . In addition , the similarity of the design can make it easier to react to emergencies . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to verification that the same problem does not exist in all the other plants , " says Frank Carr , the deputy director in the nuclear development division of the French Atomic Energy Commission . The drawback , he admits , is that a generic problem with the technology in any of the plants means that repairs must be made in all the plants . The second major characteristic of the French program -- close cooperation among EDF , Areva , the Atomic Energy Commission , and the government -- lends itself to coordinating research and development and establishing a nuclear power strategy . Such closely knit cooperation is , of course , much easier in France , which has a long tradition of government involvement in major industrial enterprises , ranging from the supersonic Concorde jetliner to the TGV high-speed train . The downside , according to critics , is that in the case of the French program , the government simply decided to trivialize the risks by placing the nuclear power plants near where people live , thereby giving a false sense of security as the installations came to be seen as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nuclear waste treatment that Paris and Washington disagree most strongly . The French have been recycling nuclear waste for some 25 years , a process the United States strongly opposes because it requires separating uranium from plutonium , which in theory could then be diverted to the production of nuclear weapons . The French argue that recycling waste material is the best way to deal with the waste problem and to ensure the long-term availability of uranium . " In France , we have confidence in the efficiency of the safety measures and in being able to control nuclear proliferation , " Carr says . While the debate goes on , nuclear energy is poised for a global comeback . More than 30 applications for nuclear power plants are pending with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the United States . Italy , Britain , China , India , and even Russia , which is awash in oil and natural gas , are eager to build . So are several Eastern European countries that are vulnerable to cutoffs of Russian natural gas .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
