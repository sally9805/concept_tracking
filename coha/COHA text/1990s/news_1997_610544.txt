<p> " Would you like a sample , ma'am ? " <p> The lady with the short gray hair is offering a choice today . " Now what would you prefer ? " she asks brightly , proffering tidbits wrapped in golden foil . " There 's ' Chocolate Chunk , ' and then there 's the ' Honey Graham . ' If you buy three of these products , you get a free half gallon of milk ! " <p> It works . <p> Screeching to a halt mid-aisle in the vastly bright cathedral of victuals known as the Olney Shoppers Food Warehouse , the customer leans , elbows on cart handles , studying the merits of this unexpected benison . <p> A freebie ! <p> But Marguerite " Margo " McCallum Jackson is already on to the next  --  " Ladies ! May I give you . . . honey . . . chocolate . . . half gallon of milk free  --  if you buy three of these : There 's always a catch ! " <p> Yes . <p> So it is that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long and eventful life with her children and grands- and great-grands- scattered , and many a fond memory to comfort her on a winter night ( those languid summers at their family place on Cape Cod in the ' 30s when " we sailed and we swam and we fished " ; the boy she was to marry before he died fighting for freedom in the Brenner Pass in the winter of ' 44 ; her own World War II Army service ; the aerospace engineer she 'd loved and married and who 'd loved her , too , except somehow he 'd neglected to provide for their old age before he passed away in ' 84 )  --  time and destiny have brought her , finally , to this special station in life : <p> Giveaway girl in a grocery store . <p> " Would you like a sample , sir ? " Jackson invites . <p> " Oh , " says a woman who is already standing there , munching a sample , " they 're little graham treats . Oh my goodness ! " <p> " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickel you 're doing well , " Jackson urges , with Yankee charm . <p> " Oh , that 's nice , " the shopper says , taking a coupon worth $ 1.50 . <p> A Shoppers Food Warehouse employee walks by . " If you see your chip partner , " he tells Jackson , without breaking stride , " tell her they 're going to be bringing 20 cases of chips up . " <p> Indeed , Jackson is part of a well-oiled giveaway machine in the store this day . Other stations offer samples of Maier 's Butter Top Wheat Bread ( individually buttered , of course , by Jackson 's pal Rhoda Krens ) , Brother 's Gourmet Coffee , Breyer 's NutRageous ice cream , Michael Season 's Lightly Salted Potato Chips , Barbar 's Raspberry &; Wheat FigBars , and  --  the day 's big draw  --  Tony 's Italian Style Pastry Crust Sausage &; Pepperoni Pizza . <p> Some shoppers go from one station to another , wolfing down the equivalent of a free lunch while shopping . <p> Jackson , like the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with name tag . Her samples , and the larger boxes of the nine products ( including Fruit by the Foot , SweetRewards and DunkAroos ) that customers can buy to cash in on the free milk offer , are neatly arrayed on a blue-and-white check tablecloth . Jackson 's basic line of patter is carefully prescribed , though she tosses in plenty of personality as one of 400 demonstrators working for Laurel-based VMH Marketing . The firm does contract spot marketing for some 1,600 grocery stores in the Washington-Baltimore region . <p> " I 've done pizza , too , and it 's the hardest , " Jackson observes to Krens during a break . " Ice cream is another one . " <p> " Pizza , you ca n't make it fast enough , " Krens agrees . " You get carpal tunnel syndrome . It 's really awful . One time I did 1,000 slices and the store manager finally had to say , ' Enough ! ' " <p> At the pizza station today  --  which Jackson also drops by during her break  --  Lycrecia Scott is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little toaster oven , then slices it into small segments . Repeatedly . <p> Customers stand around , watching and waiting . <p> " They stand and glare at me , " Scott confides with a chuckle . " It could be $ 10 bills I 'm handing out . It 's hard to believe people are that desperate for a piece of pizza . " <p> " I always say to myself , ' The animals are at the gates , ' " agrees colleague Rene McMaster , who has also dropped by the pizza station . " One time I was doing Hillshire sausage and a man stuck his fingers into the oven to get a piece . I told him , ' It 's half frozen ! ' " <p> " I was cooking spaghetti one time , " Scott reminisced , " and some guy stuck his finger in the sauce  --  give me a break ! I mean , how gauche . I had to throw out the whole thing . " <p> Break time over , Jackson heads back to her station via the cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvester . <p> She enjoys her job . <p> " It 's good fun , " Jackson says by phone from the Lanham apartment she shares with her cat and her 48-year-old divorced son , Bill . " I like meeting the people , and every once in a while you find someone who is so funny , whether they mean to be or not , and it makes your whole day . <p> " One time I was doing a stir-fry that was all vegetables . Maybe it had tofu in it , but no meat . I stirred it all up and I was serving it and this woman came by with four or five kids and I gave them all samples . Well , later she came tearing back and she said , ' You did n't give my kids any meat ! ' I said , ' I 'm sorry , madam , but there 's no meat in the dish . ' It 's those kinds of things that just leave you so tickled inside because you figure , ' I finally got one over on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> " You have nice people and really crazy ones . I was out in Potomac at the Safeway with a product  --  they 're jellies , one is jalapeno and the other is chili , but they 're sweet . They 've got a lot of zing to them . . . and they went like hotcakes . You serve them on a cracker with cream cheese . Well , some woman came in and licked all the stuff off the cracker , and threw it in the trash . She ate three or four like that , and I was beginning to get annoyed . Later I was told she had a chauffeur and furs , although in the store she had on these ratty-looking sweats and dirty sneakers . She looked like a bag lady , but she evidently was one of the wealthiest people in Potomac . . . . <p> " People tell you things I do n't think they 'd even tell their mother  --  problems with husbands and children . There 's one woman I meet down in Greenbelt a good many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes when I see her she looks like doom and I ask , ' How 's your husband ? ' ' Terrible ! ' The next week I see her and she 's up ! ' He 's doing well . ' . . . <p> " I got to talking with another woman and I said to her , ' You have such sad eyes . ' Well , her husband decided at the age of 58 or 59 that he wanted a younger woman . He left her , and she did n't have a damn thing . She told me what she was waiting for : that when he 's 62 she could get half of his Social Security . She 'd fought him in court , but she could get nowhere ; he was a very shrewd cookie . Poor thing . . . . <p> " The saddest thing I ever heard . . . well , I met a woman at a store and we got to talking . . . about animals : My big cat , Rascal , died of a heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so much , that 's one reason I got the flu so badly this past November . The woman said she and her husband had no children , but they had quite a few cats and dogs . There 's a pet cemetery in Aspen Hill , and they buried their animals up there when they died . <p> " And when her husband died , he was buried there , too . She said he felt his animals were dearer to him than anybody . She said she 's going in there , too , she 's got a plot . She said she was more content with the idea of going into a cemetery with her pets than with a bunch of strangers . . . . It made me feel like I wanted to sit there and cry , because I felt it 's so lonely  --  wanting to be buried in the pet cemetery . That 's sad . <p> " I have n't seen her recently . " <p> Earlier in the grocery store , Jackson shoots the breeze with shopper Ruth Simione . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson says , mentioning the city where her father was an attorney while she was growing up . <p> " It 's one of the most wonderful cities , " Simione replies , examining Jackson 's table of goodies . " My son eats Fruit by the Foot , by the yard ! " <p> They reminisce , discussing the little wax candies of their youth  --  the ones with sweet colored liquids inside . " You could get them for a penny , " Jackson recalls . " And every drugstore had a fountain where you could get real good stuff . " <p> " Not that stuff we have today , " Simione agrees . <p> Before you know it , Simione has moved on and Jackson is deep in discussion with shopper Harry Coyte . " My son demonstrates , too , " he 's saying , leaning on his cart . " He does Webber grills . He says the only problem is when they cook the turkey and try to cut it , " everybody is reaching for a piece at once . <p> " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Jackson 's samples . " So it 's marshmallow and all that kind of good stuff . " <p> " Oh , they 're great for kids , " Jackson coaxes . " I like them for my grandchildren . " <p> " It 's my husband 's lunch I 'll put them in , " Stiner concludes firmly , " if I can keep it hidden till then . He 's got to have his sweet thing . " <p> They laugh . <p> Whereupon Bill Coogan , Jackson 's supervisor , drops by . <p> " Well , I had a terrible night , " she confides to him . " This little kitty I have , Sylvester , the wind scared him and all night long it was like a racetrack around my apartment . " <p> Earlier , she 'd been chatting with a shopper about the bora , a big cold wind in Russia . <p> " They call it the Siberian Express , " she 'd explained . <p> And thus , for 12 years now  --  day after day , with pluck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're most welcome , madam here and a I would n't be surprised if it were n't in Aisle Eight there  --  Jackson has graciously and cheerfully manned her duty station in life . <p> It 's not her way to whine at the might-have-beens . <p> " Life is as it is , you know , " she says by phone , dispensing more than mere alimentary information . " If people would learn to roll with the punches , they would be far better off . You ca n't do a heck of a lot to change your lot in life except , as my mother used to say , ' Pull up your socks and get on with living ! ' " <p> It 's about attitude . In her view , there 's always something to look forward to . <p> Like Monday . <p> " Monday I 'm going to be doing Little Debbie , " she says , " and I love Little Debbie stuff . They have this . . . vanilla cookie . In the middle is a little bit of red jelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it kind of swirls around to a point , and then it 's dunked in chocolate ! <p> " It 's wonderful . "
