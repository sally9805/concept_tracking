Many fine potters thrive on the difficult romance with their kilns . Wed to the flame , they somehow endure the refractory heartaches and misfortunes that once led Bernard Palissy down an anguished path of botched glazes to what he thought would surely be " death 's door . " For most potters , this path is lit by the bright hope of cutting one more exquisitely vitrified deal with nature : " This will be the firing that succeeds , " chirps a voice in their heads . And even when the kiln reduces their hopes to lumpy puddles of carbon-soaked glass and grog , that little voice chimes like an encouraging harbor bell , over and over again . Around 1988 the voice in Kurt Weiser 's head began suggesting there must be a better way . After more than 15 years of trying to strike the right compromise between the variable atmospheres  --  too hot , too cool , too little oxygen , an excess of carbon  --  of his kilns , he turned his back on the fiction of high-fire control . Wanting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been making and spent a year assiduously scratching black-and-white drawings onto the sides of his cast teapots . Then he unhitched himself altogether from the modern train and rolled quietly into the domesticated pastime of applying and firing China paints on one pot at a time . Obsessive , humorous , ironic , the cast porcelain teapots , plates and covered jars Weiser has made in the past four years are among the most vividly decorated forms in recent American ceramics . They are also some of the most engagingly storied . Their moral tales of scientific scrutiny , lust , predation and godly or-worse  --  spousal retribution follow the thoroughly modern Platonic rule that good people dream what evil people practice . Weiser 's are n't the howling , angst-ridden cartoons of nightmares that have dominated much of current narrative ceramics , but , rather , the pleasantly narcotic reveries of an errant former altar boy . His preferred sedative is the exotic of common frailties . It releases him into a private Eden where the cozy haze of an overactive libido is often cut by the sobering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or preachy about his pots ; they simply offer the soft-spoken images of a potentially bad conscience working overtime . The Cold War-vintage map that hangs like a picture window behind the stainless-steel laboratory table where he works each evening says more about Weiser 's aspirations and approach than anything else in his Tempe , Arizona , studio . Its dusty blue oceans and black continents , sectioned like a butcher 's diagram of a cow , show the bare outlines of the distant shores he likes to conjure . And its prospect of the earth 's topography laid out on a single sheet goads him toward the seamless , wraparound space he attempts to paint on each pot . The map also suggests that whenever he is working there  --  perched in an Asian crouch atop an orange diner stool  --  he is much farther from home than the short walk across his shaded yard . Weiser , who is 44 , grew up in East Lansing , Michigan . When he showed the usual teenage signs of running with a bad crowd , his parents shipped him upstate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punk to Salvador Dali , to Abstract Expressionism , Maija Grotell and Peter Voulkos in a matter of months . Intoxicated by the tactility of clay , he told himself that as soon as he got the hang of working with it he would go back to the less addictive pursuits of drawing and painting . In a sense , he has , but only after taking an extraordinarily scenic route . His first stop was the Kansas City Art Institute , where he studied with Ken Ferguson , Victor Babu and ( briefly ) Jacquelyn Rice . After short teaching stints in Portland , Oregon , he returned to his approximate beginnings , getting what academics aptly call a " terminal " degree ( M.F.A. ) from the University of Michigan . From 1977 to 1988 , he directed the Archie Bray Foundation in Helena , Montana , and since leaving there has taught at Arizona State University . From early on , Weiser was preoccupied with the compelling abstract beauty of pottery . Its subtle formality allowed him to tap his emotions without overtly having to spill his beans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pottery 's extensive history also encompassed just the right touch of authority and lenience , leaving the door ajar for him to explore the great variety of forms that he has . Unlike his teachers , Weiser never had to escape the postwar burden and rubric of forms prescribed by function . He always considered his utilitarian ware an opportunity to play with the abstraction of physical proportions . And he never paid much attention to the earnest rhetoric that ornament is a crime . In fact , his early assumption was that the only purpose of form was to support some sort of fantasy . The trick was to develop forms that could comfortably carry the sometimes awkward weight of his wandering daydreams . Henry Takemoto 's pottery from the late 1950s and early 1960s was the first to convince Weiser that this fusion was possible . Beautifully shaped and decorated with sprawling , elegant doodles , his work epitomized for Weiser the dual realities of pottery 's surface and form . When you looked at the drawing on Takemoto 's pottery , says Weiser , " the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing seemed to slip from view . Standing as they did on their own , their separate but mutual existence forced the mind to rapidly shuttle from one to the other , alternating between comparing and marveling , moving and pausing . This fantasy of travel between surface and form preoccupied Weiser throughout his years at Archie Bray . To create forms that stood on their own , he turned increasingly to constructed and molded configurations that initially were an amalgam of Bauhaus , biology and Deco . Then he danced them into complicated arrangements based on  --  that 's right  --  the tango . Weiser drew a great many of his ideas for surfaces from his Montana surroundings , an iced-over hell in winter , the color of straw in summer . The outcropped landscape and the Bray 's brickyard were full of crisp , stony colors , soft topographic bulges and warm variegated hues that Weiser could put to good use . He also found himself looking at the vivid Big Sky constellations , trying to concoct a surface that would evince the twinkling blackboard density of the looming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the black stone of Inuit rock carvings had just the quality he sought . But they also had the handmade appearance he was striving to escape . He wanted his forms to have the physical integrity of an inexplicable natural process , as if they had washed up on a beach , fallen from the sky , or  --  come to think of it  --  tumbled from the fire of a lucky kiln . By the late 1980s , Weiser was getting along well with the kilns at the Bray , but not to the point of feeling that their power to trash his work would n't appear the next time he opened the kiln door . The fact that his Tango pots were getting as complicated as infrastructure made the potential for loss even more unpalatable . Yet there was something else that nagged him . The Tango pots were beginning to have the dry and somewhat twisted appeal of an erotic dancer moving to the beat of a military band . Their increasingly formal oompah , oompah left little room for the kind of sensual and narrative play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he says , was " the old Catholic thing of not wanting to deal with the juicy stuff , or to reveal too much about the things that really interest you . " What really interested him was the exotic backwater of self-absorption . This has been the subject of his work for the past five years . Supplanting the tango with sgraffito , he initially pursued it by scratching exotic botanical scenes through black slip on teapots . The process was as direct as Weiser could make it , allowing him not only to draw what really interested him , but also to make work that no longer stood as a barrier between himself and what he was thinking . He could lose himself in the obsessive drawing , drifting into eerie scenes of the desert at night . There 's a moon and the odd serrated underlighting of foliage at shopping malls in just about every teapot . And there is also the sense  --  found in 18th  --  and 19th-century botanical and zoological illustrations-that these are scenes from another world . Weiser is well aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the homey decorum of teapots . In fact , as his work evolved from black and white to full color , he relied increasingly on matching disparate scenes within the body of his decorations . In Same Girl , 1993 , for example , he poses a serene-looking Leda and her concerned swan on one side of the form and a raised scissors-shaped hand on the other . You are left to guess what that hand is about to snip . In Bug Lesson , 1994 , the lizard on one side of the pot and the curious person  --  like a looming face at a party  --  on the other appear to have a similar interest in entomology . Whether it 's predatory or scientific is than Weiser 's earlier pottery did about the steamy , chirping and cawing swamp of his psyche , their images are still just obscure enough to free him from being responsible for whatever message people like to think they convey . The scenes have the teeming lushness of places he has visited in Thailand . Yet the general tone is Adam and Eve according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just grabbed the fruit and someone is trying to pry it out of their hands . All of this squabbling , of course , occurs within the intimate confines of form . That is where the ambiguity of Weiser 's images stops . As he has become more adept at handling the brush , he has gradually moved away from the two-sided character of his earlier work , filling the space of his forms in a way that the reserve painters of Meissen perhaps were never allowed to imagine . The active decorative lines of his paintings spring from the relatively simple topography of the forms . In most of his teapots , for example , those lines generally move in the direction of the spout . In the case of his heavily foliated covered vessels , such as Iguana Jar 2 , 1993 , they sweep easily around the curving walls , one side dissolving with an oceanic ease into the next . The quirky sensibility of these works belongs to Weiser , but their details are often copies of scenes from someone else 's paintings . He borrows regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes the distant vistas by painters of the Hudson River School , the turbulent eternity depicted by the German Romantics , and the Good Friday skies of the 16th-century Dutch and Italians . Yet most of the shrubbery is his . His son once suggested that Weiser paints foliage when he does n't have any other ideas . But , as his work indicates , that 's rarely the case . Kurt Weiser always has other ideas . The question is whether he can get away with saying them out loud . Work by Kurt Weiser is included with that of Janel Jacobson , James Lovera , Ah Leon and Beth Forer in the exhibition " Ancient China  --  Modern Clay : Influences on Five Ceramic Artists " at the Phoenix Art Museum , Arizona ( October 1  --  January 9 , 1995 ) . Edward Lebow is curator of the Ken Ferguson retrospective scheduled to open March 21 , 1995 , at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art , Kansas City , Missouri . <p>                 @ @ @ @
