Paved with russet-colored bricks , the central quadrangle at Washington is known on campus as Red Square . That may explain why Nebraska looked so at ease in Seattle last Saturday . After all , Cornhuskers football evokes the old Soviet Union . // There 's Nebraska 's nickname ( Big Red ) and the five-year plans that most Huskers players follow . There 's the relentless monotony of the Huskers ' stolid and anachronistic offense . There 's the revered but mysterious leader , coach Tom Osborne , whose every practice remains closed as tightly as his mouth . " I know Tom , " Washington coach Jim Lambright said jokingly last Friday . " And I know how he loves to babble on and on in those long , in-depth interviews . " Indeed , after fielding a single postgame question on Saturday , Osborne inquired , politely but impatiently , " Anything else ? " // Yet the Cornhuskers did n't simply resemble a former superpower last week : They showed that they still are one . Having failed to three-peat as national champions last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive controls , the Huskers came to Washington off a pair of unconvincing triumphs . " Two mediocre victories against two subpar teams , " said senior defensive end Jason Peter of wins over Akron and Central Florida . " I 'm sure people think the only reason Nebraska is 2-0 is because it schedules subpar opponents . " // Subpar Central Florida was leading the Cornhuskers 17-14 in the second quarter on Sept. 13 when , unthinkably , many card-carrying Nebraska fans effectively revolted . Frost , who had sat out the Cornhuskers ' previous series , returned to the huddle and heard what were believed to be the first concerted boos ever directed toward a home player in Memorial Stadium 's 74-year history . " It 's been very distressing to me , when all Scott has done is the best that he can , " said Osborne last week . " He 's on a scholarship worth $7,000 . This is n't a pro quarterback. " // Try telling that to every Husker Bob and Bobbi in the state . Frost 's first sin was to attend Stanford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) High , which he describes as " 90 miles down the interstate " from Lincoln . He transferred to Nebraska in 1995 , but the following season , his first as the Cornhuskers ' starter , Nebraska lost as many games  --  two  --  as it had won national titles under previous quarterback Tommie Frazier. // So Frost wore a baseball cap tugged low on his forehead as he circulated on campus last week , though the lid hardly rendered him incognito . " Lincoln is a small town , " he said . " People recognize you everywhere you go . " // He had just emerged from his 11:30 a.m. philosophy class , and he spoke , as you might imagine , rather philosophically . " You can count on both hands the schools where fans expect a national championship every year , " Frost said . " Florida , Florida State , Ohio State , Michigan , Notre Dame and Nebraska . Beating our rivals is great , but the fans are n't satisfied unless we win a national championship . " // As the Cornhuskers huddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-captain , shouted a reminder to his teammates . " Do n't forget ! " he yelled , struggling to be heard in legendarily loud Husky Stadium , which is often called the House of Pain . " We 're Nebraska ! We won back-to-back championships ! We dominated college football in the ' 90s ! " // And just like that , the Huskers were back , like it or not . " Love us or hate us , " as Peter would later put it . Frost ran for touchdowns of 34 and 30 yards on Nebraska 's first two possessions  --  he finished with 97 rushing yards  --  while backfield tanks Ahman Green and Joel Makovicka rumbled for 129 yards apiece on the option and up the middle . In a style frighteningly redolent of seasons past the Big Red rolled over Washington 27-14. // " A lot of people wrote us off this year , " Frost said afterward . " I 'm not saying we 're home free now . But people definitely have to watch out for us . " With games remaining against Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Missouri and Iowa State , Nebraska is poised to be unbeaten heading into its Nov. 28 showdown at Colorado . // Offensively , Nebraska punched the ball through the Huskies ' line like a pill through foil packaging . Frost played flawlessly before a crowd that included his parents , Nebraska alumni Carol ( a former Huskers track star and coach ) and Larry ( a former Huskers halfback ) , and his older brother , Steve . On defense the Huskers played as Peter had hoped they eventually would this season . Which is to say , " Eleven men on every ball , like a pack of crazed dogs . " // Peter spoke , too , of the media 's peculiar fascination with Nebraska , the need to rip not only the Cornhuskers but also the state . " I laugh at the Nebraska jokes , " Peter said of one Seattle columnist 's hatchet job , which had been reprinted in the Lincoln Journal Star . " They settle me down . They 're entertaining . But when people say that Coach Osborne will do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bothers me . " ( Jason 's brother Christian , a Cornhuskers star in ' 94 and ' 95 , was convicted of third-degree sexual assault while at Nebraska and suspended from the team. ) // The truth is , these Huskers have endured a mere three arrests in the past 18 months . Another truth is that of late , the Cornhuskers ' biggest critics have been the so-called Nebraska faithful . " Some people are going to have to eat their words about our offense , " defensive end Grant Wistrom said after the Huskers rushed for 407 yards and 23 first downs last Saturday against a defense that had held its first two opponents  --  BYU and San Diego State  --  to a rather stingy total of minus-five yards on the ground . " Especially some of our fans . " // Roughly 10,000 Nebraska supporters made the trip to Seattle , and countless new fans and friends would no doubt await Frost back in Lincoln . " I really do n't care , " he said when that was put to him after the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have  --  have been my friends through everything . " // Moments later he made for the exit . On this day Frost was hatless , and when he stepped into the sunshine , a red sea of Cornhuskers fans crowded against a barricade to reach for his hand . " Way to go , Scott ! " several people shouted , but Frost never reached out to any of them , never looked up , never broke stride . He did n't acknowledge a single cheering fan among the 100 or so who lined the path to the team bus . He just kept walking , briskly , until he reached his family , which silently engulfed him in an embrace .
