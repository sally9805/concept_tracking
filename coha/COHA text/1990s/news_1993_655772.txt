<p> HERE 'S a horticultural truism to ponder : One man 's exotic is another man 's native . <p> Taylor 's Guide to Natural Gardening ( Houghton Mifflin , 507 pp. , $ 18.95 paper ) offers an explanation . " Plants imported to North America from elsewhere are often called ' exotics , ' whereas those indigenous to our continent are called natives . " It works the other way round as well , of course . A native trillium from the United States is an exotic in Europe . But further than this , the book says , a native ca n't be defined only as a plant belonging to a continent ; natives are regional . So , within the US , a plant native to the Atlantic seacoast becomes an exotic when grown , say , in the Midwest . It becomes " as much an exotic as a plant from China . " <p> This guide concerns itself with growing natives . In tune with the environmentally correct times in which we live , it advocates and provides an impressive amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than " a method . " The idea - natural gardening - is regional gardening . It is definitely a trend . It necessitates getting to know your garden 's habitat , its natural plants , and the conditions they like . Such " attractive , highly adapted plants " already more or less in your " backyard , " the guide suggests , " usually require little maintenance and irrigation . " <p> And then the idea of natural gardening necessitates what , to many gardeners , is a revolutionary step : partial or even total abandonment of plants that are not native . Those likely to feel uncomfortable about this are gardeners who enjoy growing , say , Japanese maples or old-fashioned English hybrid roses . Are they unnatural gardeners ? <p> The useful encyclopedia section of this guide does n't claim to be more than a toe in the water . It describes , for the whole United States , a mere 300 plants . ( In the Northeast alone , more than 5,000 wild plants grow . ) <p> The hardiness zones to which the listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How to Grow " each of them . Sometimes " good cultivars " are included , perhaps as a gesture toward semi-natural gardeners . And anyway , the book cautions against changing over from a conventional garden that includes exotics to a natural plot in one fell swoop . What such natural-looking gardens cleverly disguise is that they can not be achieved , or maintained , without a great deal of persistent work . They do not grow themselves . <p> The magic words " with practically no maintenance " appear on the cover of another new book with a bias toward gardening that at least appears " natural , " even if it is n't confined to regional natives . Easy Care Shade Flowers , by Patricia A. Taylor ( Simon &; Schuster , 176 pp. , $ 14 paper ) , is a cheerful book designed to make people who thought the deep shade cast by the trees that canopy their garden meant they could n't grow colorful flowers . Plants like ivies , hostas , or ferns love shade , but they flower insignificantly or not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that from blue bugle weed to red-flowered fire pink to white bloodroot to yellow Celandine poppies , bright color can sparkle in shadowy places . Like these particular species , many plants suitable for shade are basically wild . Even blue bugle , though from the old world , is so comfortable in some regions that it escapes into the wild . <p> The more unusual the plant , the trickier it can be to obtain - and the more expensive and risky to grow it is likely to be . But in a world overrun by garden centers with an increasingly standardized range of plants - and with the help of Taylor 's Guide to Specialty Nurseries , by Barbara J. Barton ( Houghton Mifflin , 245 pp. , $ 16.95 paper ) - it can be a stimulating challenge to hunt for rarer plants . This is the subject of William C. Mulligan 's new book , The Adventurous Gardener 's Sourcebook of Rare and Unusual Plants ( Simon &; Schuster , 224 pp. , $ 40 ) . Like the books already mentioned , this one helpfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind Mulligan 's text , which is deliciously and temptingly supported by Elvin McDonald 's fine and informative color photographs , could n't be much further from the concept of " natural gardening . " Yet even this book includes wonderful-looking plants that would grow very contentedly among wild natives . A ground cover called Ardisia japonica , for example , shiny-leaved and red-berried , is featured as a striking novelty , and it 's good for shade , too . Some of the plants shown are not that unusual , though a beauty like Lavendula stoechas , with its headdresses of rose-purple petals , is rarer in the US than in Britain ( where a year or two ago it appeared in all the garden centers ) . <p> This would make a valued gift book for an already accomplished gardener with time , ambition , and a healthy bank balance . <p> In contrast , Anne Halpin 's Great Gardens From Everyday Plants ( Simon &; Schuster , 160 pp. , $ 17 paper ) is a down-to-earth book for enthusiastic beginners . Anyone who has gardened for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but many of these plants are quite wonderful , and a fresh look at them might stimulate some old hand to try them once more . Nasturtiums and ageratums and little blue border-edging lobelias have their own magic . <p> The books that probably appeal most to keen gardeners have a catalog or encyclopedia element to them . No true gardener can ever have enough lists , descriptions , and above all , good , clear color photographs of plants to refer to and drool over . <p> Ornamental Shrubs , Climbers and Bamboos , by Graham Stuart Thomas ( Sagapress/Timber Press , Portland , Ore. , 585 pp. , $ 49.95 ) , is just such a book . The author did the same scientific , exhaustive study of perennial garden plants . This fat book describes thousands of species in alphabetical order . <p> Two other new encyclopedic books that might earn a place on the shelf of a gardener planning to develop a sizable garden over a number of years are Rodale 's Illustrated Encyclopedia of Perennials , by Ellen Phillips and C. Colston Burrell ( Rodale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blooms of Bressingham Garden Plants : Choosing the Best Hardy Plants for Your Garden , by Alan and Adrian Bloom ( HarperCollins , 320 pp. , $ 35 ) . <p> Rodale 's encyclopedia is concerned with designing the perennial garden in the US and cultivation advice . The chapter on propagation is especially helpful . A splendid idea is a list of cultivars that come true from seed ( many do not ) . <p> The Blooms ' encyclopedia , though revised for the American reader , did n't start out that way . Its authors are renowned nurserymen in Britain . Their nurseries dominate the trade in perennials and conifers supplied to garden centers . Their expertise in these fields is reflected in this book , which also , among its 5,000 descriptions of plants and 750 color photographs , looks at grasses , ferns , alpines , and heathers . The company is just beginning to invade the US with plants it has introduced . <p> With perennials ever more popular , a rethink on annuals is a good notion . Wayne Winterrowd 's encyclopedic Annuals for Connoisseurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall , 210 pp. , $ 25 ) includes many plants unfamiliar or forgotten . One great idea : Propagate annuals from root cuttings . Winterrowd advises not planting annuals in rows , but interspersing them comfortably with perennials . Among many I immediately want to grow is Rhodochiton atrosanguineum - with its waxy , dangling flowers - just to join Winterrowd 's appreciation of its " wit . " <p> One finely produced series is the Hearst Garden Guides published by Hearst Books , which sell for $ 25 each . New guides in this series are Bulbs , edited by John E. Bryan ( 191 pp . ) , Perennials , edited by Darrel Apps ( 208 pp . ) , Annuals , edited by Ted Marston ( 192 pp. ) , and Trees and Shrubs , edited by R. William Thomas ( 208 pp . ) . The word " comprehensive " on the covers of these comparatively slim books suggests , however , an all-inclusiveness that is scarcely plausible . <p> " Bulbs " seems particularly useful and well presented . The photographs by Andrew Lawson are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are described , and only six are shown in photographs . However , four kinds of trillium are included - a delectable group of woodland plants that for some are exotics , for others natives . There was no mention of them in " Natural Gardening " and " Rare and Unusual Plants , " while their absence from " Easy Care Shade Flowers " might be that in some places they are not easy at all . But then that is true - as " Natural Gardening " points out - of virtually any plant . <p> " Bulbs " is so informative that I wish it was twice the size , something along the lines of a marvelous book written by D. M. van Gelderen and J. R. P. van Hoey Smith called Rhododendron Portraits ( Timber Press , $ 75 ) . This volume takes the value of good color photographs for identification purposes to brilliant extremes - 1,150 photographs of rhododendron species , varieties , and cultivars . It is the perfect , indeed probably the only way that the subtle differences of form and color between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be clearly shown in a book . The same authors were responsible for a similar book on conifers in 1986 . Only color photographs of this quantity and quality genuinely approach the comprehensive . <p> Harder to categorize is Tulips , by photographer Peter Arnold ( Macmillan , 84 pp. , $ 30 ) . This book displays a number of unquestionably exotic tulips in 71 big color photographs . Somewhat extravagant images posed with a determined artificiality before plain white or black backgrounds and lit by artificial light and flash make up the body of the book . Arnold evidently felt all this art - if that is the right term - was not quite enough . After an interestingly written , brief history of tulips , he appends a list of bulb suppliers and tulip festivals . What I missed is at least one photograph of ordinary florist 's tulips in a bowl , or a clutch of them springing up in a cottage garden , or even a commercial tulip field . These gorgeous fashion-plate flower heads are so self-consciously " beauty photography " that they almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old mother Earth at all . <p> , this tree has spreading branches and heart-shaped leaves. , FROM ' TREES AND SHRUBS '
