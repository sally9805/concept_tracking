As communist icons fall and the iron curtain is lifted , western sportsmen are now exploring " new " Russia 's treasured salmon streams . Inside a howling Russian MI-8 helicopter , foam earplugs screwed into my head , it is difficult to sort out the kaleidoscopic changes of the past 48 hours . Our party of nine anglers has flown from the United States to St. Petersburg to Kirovsk , and we are now engaged in the final 1-1/2-hour leg to base camp . Our target , the Ponoi River , rests just north of the Arctic Circle on Russia 's Kola Peninsula . Not coincidentally , the area is home to the world 's fastest Atlantic salmon fishing . Nothing stirs in the chopper except the little Russian spaniel across from me  --  it is about to drop through the lap of its owner , a former Russian official under the previous regime , who has fallen asleep on the shoulder of our translator , Natalya . Needless to say , Natalya is not at all pleased about it . The spaniel scrabbles with its front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lap . " Dog thinks its old man 's dead , " quips fellow angler Jake Jordan who , like me , is suffering from a 38-hour sleepless stretch , followed by a scant five hours of slumber last night . In truth , we could have slept after the transatlantic flight , but who would miss the chance to see  --  even fleetingly  --  the treasures of St. Petersburg ? It was also July Fourth , and outside the city in the wooded , gently rolling , deciduous and pine-covered country , an association of young Russian anglers and hunters had laid out a feast for us . In a small clearing near the woods , tent flies were strung drum tight . Samovars of black tea steamed in a soft intermittent rain . The kabob was of wild boar , the ever-present bottles of vodka helped ease the misty chill , and through our translators it was quickly evident that American and Russian sportsmen speak the same language . But now , aboard the helicopter , my reminiscence is disturbed by a screeching sound that sends a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no deadly equipment failure but Norman Hyams priming the fussy reeds of his bagpipes , carried all this way to celebrate the close of each day 's fishing glory . We hope there is reason for celebration on this trip . The plan is to base ourselves on the fish-rich Ponoi River , first visited three years ago by rod maker Gary Loomis and his Finnish partner , Eero Petersson , who have returned on this expedition . Each day we will fly to new rivers . We will use a smaller MI-2 helicopter that holds four anglers , guide and the pilot . We might find a mother lode of fish  --  or nothing . But as a hedge against total failure we have the Ponoi itself , where fish abound . We will settle in the river 's upper camp , 185 miles from the mouth of the river . The lower camp , 60 miles from the sea , is the " numbers " camp , where anglers go when bent on taking Atlantic salmon in mind-boggling quantities . The upper camp is used as the jumping-off point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a base for fishing this area of the Ponoi . The chopper thwacks over birches and willows near the riverbank to a clearing surrounded by stunted pines . It whines down to blessed silence while we unscrew our earplugs . Camp is perfect : roomy , bright wall tents with wood floors , a large dining tent , a banya  --  Russian sauna  --  and a shower house with endless hot water . But it is the foot trail along the little Pacha tributary leading to the Ponoi that we flock to . Eighteen-foot aluminum boats with 20 or 40-hp motors are nosed onto the coble beach and are used to reach the river beats . Tonight we wade the Home Pool , spreading out in a steady current that is stronger than it first appears . After 15 minutes , and within casting range of someone , a fish missiles through the surface , then crashes heavily on its side . Soon other fish roll and leap . The mood intesifies ; you can see it in everyone 's attitude and casting . Shortly there are cries of dismay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment as the line tightens , before the hook pulls free . At 10:30 that night , the sky as bright as a late New England afternoon in this land of endless summer sun , angler Roberto Sacconi hooks up . The fish instantly tears line and backing from his experimental STH reel before taking to the air . The Argentine angler is shouting in English , mainly . The hook continues to hold , and in time Sacconi is removing the fly and telling the bright , 10-pound , fresh-run salmon how beutiful it is . When we finally sleep , it is not full nightfall . And once the initial impulse for rest is satisfied , the ever-lingering brightness wakes us . I find myself wandering around camp at 4 a.m. with a cuckoo bird singing behind the tent . Out schedule is ambitious . We will fish rivers such as the Purnach , a major 65-mile-long Ponoe River tributary , and the smaller Bab'ya with its barrier falls , clear pools and stacked fish . Some of our group will soar downriver to intercept salmon coming in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south , then fly northwest to the river of giant salmon , the Yokanga ( written lokanga on most Rusian maps ) . The Yokanga seems designed for large salmon , a river of deep swift pools , wild rushes of white water , innumerable splits and side channels . We feel a bit disconcerted flying its course . On many maps the area remains encircled in red , a closed military zone sometimes called the circle of death , and for good reason . Nearby on the Barents seacoast is Severomorsk , headquarters of the Russian nuclear submarine fleet , and at the river 's mouth itself at Gremikha there is a repair facility for those craft . But , of course , we are holding permits that allow us to be here . Thoughts of war machines vanish as our little chopper soars over a stretch of white water to a rocky beach and touches down . Our guide Sergey is out , keeping low , fitting stones the size of boccie balls under the skids , while the pilot , Sasha , jiggles the helicopter like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out  --  Gary Loomis , his brother Bob , Sacconi and me . The river is all splits and channels with one main island in its center . In a large pool a huge fish rises on Gary Loomis ' second cast , turns and follows downstream , finally nudging the fly with its nose . We shout when the strike should occur . The fish chooses not to eat . Finally , Loomis ' tube fly is gently sipped as it swings through the current . The heavy salmon turns and immediately goes deep . It could be a remarkable fish , but we will never know . In a moment the hook pulls free . Our hearts sink . And then a lesser fish  --  in size alone  --  consumes the fly and is successfully landed ; we put its weight at 15 pounds . Meanwhile , at the tail of the island where the Yokanga rejoins itself , Roberto has hooked and lost two grand salmon that bolted down a gradient so steep it looks like a ski slope . The angler was lucky to hold 10 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is time to go . Fish of great size are obviously here , but there are fewer than expected . Soon it is apparent why . Flying over a ruz , or river narrowing , we see the net . Live , dying and dead salmon are entangled within it  --  they are food for the military . We learn , however , that the harvest is quite limited . This is early July , and the greatest salmon concentrations here are reportedly late in this month and in August . In August , Loomis-sponsored personnel will return to the area and find that the net is out . The river will be full of huge fish , half of them in the 25 to 35-pound range . The anglers will find this so encouraging that a lease for exclusive fishing rights to the river will be signed for 1993 with a net-free agreement in place . Though most angler-caught salmon are released , some are eaten and there has been concern over reports of nuclear submarine waste northeast of the Kola . No one yet knows the ocean feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least a few salmon from the area have been taken to Helsinki for testing and have been clean of contaminants . So far , our exploring has produced good fishing in fascinating waters , but now I am impatient to fish the Ponoi . With air temperature in the 40s to 50s , the weather overcast or rainy , bright wet flies on large hooks are most productive . But friend Jake Jordan remembers how last year , in warmer weather , salmon fought to intercept his green Bombers . Besides classic patterns , Ponoi fish eat steelhead and Pacific salmon flies , as well as other nameless concoctions . With these fish , it seems necessary to pause longer before hook setting than in North America 's Maritimes . We quickly find that the Ponoi remains the undisputed queen of the Kola Peninsula ; on the best days there 's the possibility of hooking 10 fish or more . Far too soon , it is over for us . Hopefully , however , this is only the start of sport-fishing expansion in a land none of us ever dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think of an evening when angler Eric Redman took a surprised and pleased Russian fisheries minister to the river for casting instruction . " The kind of thing we should have been doing with one another the past 40 years , " Redman said . I think of the warm Russian people who were happy to share their country and time with us . I am still incredulous of weekly catch rates on the Ponoi for 16 to 18 anglers  --  catches of 500 to 800 fish . But for most of us fortunate enough to have fished here , there are memories far more precious than such statistics . I remember the strains of Hyams ' bagpipes drifting across the river valley at sundown , and one or two of our group slipping quietly from camp to cast the Home Pool in the clean light of morning . I think especially of a particular fish encountered while wading one day with Stan Barer : a fish that jolted my shoulder before launching a series of jumps that took it across the river , then upstream . Suddenly other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , a rod 's length away , soared head-high , fixing on me for an instant with its wild eye . Somehow , throughout this aerial display , the hook held . I briefly cradled the silvery-bright , lavender-touched creature I had come halfway around the world to catch  --  and would again . In a heartbeat . THE NEWEST OF NEW RUSSIA While recent sportfishing has focused on western Russia 's Atlantic salmon , Alaska lodge owner Tony Sarp has quietly assembled a new joint venture in eastern Russia 's Kamchatka Peninsula , just a short jump across the Bering Sea from Alaska . Fishing on the Zhupanova River and its tributaries is now under exclusive lease by Sarp . A unique strain of sea-run rainbows exist there that , unlike our steelhead , remain in salt water for only one to three months . The fish average 10 pounds , are rarely taken under five pounds , and many 15-pounders are caught . And the catch rate is incredible . Anglers are also likely to find sea-run Dolly Varden and a unique char known as the Kundzha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all types of the Pacific salmon . Six trips were scheduled in 1992 , and 12 are set for 1993 from May 6 through October . Trips usually last for 10 days , with anglers staying in a lodge formerly used by elite Soviet hunting parties . There are daily helicopter fly-outs to sections of the main river and tributaries where fishing is done by wading or from powerboats or inflatables . Scale samples show that the sea-run rainbows do not spawn until approximately eight years of age , thus a total release policy on the species is enforced , and fishing is with flies only .
