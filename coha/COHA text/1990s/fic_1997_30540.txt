It was a good day for dreaming . It was late in the afternoon , the sun throwing long shadows when it could manage to break through the thick woods , but for the most part the translucent golden light was tangled in the tops of the trees , leaving the forest floor mysteriously shadowed . The hot , humid summer air was redolent with the pink sweetness of honeysuckle nectar , all mingled with the rich , brown odor of the earth and rotting vegetation as well as the crisp green scent of the leaves . Odors had color for Faith Devlin , and since she 'd been a little girl she had entertained herself by coloring the smells around her . Most of the colors were obvious , drawn from the way something looked . Of course the earth smelled brown ; of course that fresh , tangy scent of leaves would be green in her mind . Grapefruit smelled bright yellow ; she 'd never eaten one , but once had picked up one in the grocery store and hesitantly sniffed its skin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sweet all at the same time . The smell of things was easy to color in her mind ; the color scent of people was more difficult , because people were never just one thing , but different colors mixed together . Colors did n't mean the same in people smells that they did in thing smells . Her mother , Renee , had a dark , spicy red scent , with a few sworls of black and yellow , but the spicy red almost crowded out all the other colors . Yellow was good in things , but not in people ; neither was green , or at least some shades of it . Her father , Amos , was a sickening mixture of green , purple , yellow , and black . That one was real easy , because from a very early age she had associated him with voarting linebacker in his freshman year . He was nineteen , six foot three and still growing , and weighed a hard-packed two hundred thirty pounds . Faith knew because she 'd read all that in the sports page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4.6 forty , and had great lateral speed , whatever that was . She also knew that he was beautiful , not in a pretty way , but in the same wild , powerful way that his father 's prize stallion , Maximillian , was beautiful . His French Creole ancestry was obvious in his dark coloring , and in the clear , strong bones of his face . His thick black hair hung down to his shoulders , making him look like a medieval warrior accidentally set down in the present time . Faith read every romance about medieval knights and their fair ladies that she could get her hands on , so she knew a knight when she saw one . Her shoulder had tingled where Gray touched it , and her swelling nipples throbbed , making her blush and duck her head . Her senses were whirling dizzily with his scent , a rich , indefinable blend that she could n't describe , warm and musky , with an even deeper red than Renee 's , full of tantalizing colors in deep , luxurious hues . Jodie thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot pink blouse . She had left the top two buttons undone . " What about my shirt ? " she asked , pouting a little to make her lips stick out more too , as she had seen Renee do thousands of times . " Wrong color , " Gray had said , his voice going hard and contempt leaking into the tone . Faith knew why . It was because Renee was sleeping with his father , Guy . She 'd heard the way others talked about Renee , knew what " whore " meant . He had brushed past them then , pushing open the door and disappea ring into the drugstore . Jodie stared after him for a few seconds , then turned her greedy eyes on Faith . " Let me have your shirt , " she said . " It 's too little for you , " Faith replied , and was fiercely glad that it was . Gray had liked her shirt , had touched it , and she was n't about to give it up . Jodie had scowled at the obvious truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow shoulders strained at the seams of the two-year-old T-shirt . " I 'll get my own , " she 'd declared . She would , too , Faith thought now as she gazed dreamily up at the flickering patterns made by the sun in the trees . But Jodie would n't have the one Gray had touched ; Faith had taken it off as soon as she 'd gotten home , carefully folded it , and hidden it under her mattress . The only way anyone would find it there would be if they stripped the bed to wash the sheets , and since Faith was the only one who did that , the shirt would be safe , and she could sleep on it every night . Gray . The violence of her emotions scared her , but she could n't control them . All she had to do was see him and her heart would begin pounding so hard in her skinny chest that it hurt her ribs , and she felt hot and shivery all at the same time . Gray was like a god in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a buck , she 'd heard people say , but he was backed by the Rouillard money , and even as a young boy he 'd had a hard , reckless charm that made feminine hearts flutter . The Rouillards had spawned their share of rascals and renegades , and Gray had early shown the potential to be the wildest of the lot . But he was a Rouillard , and even when he raised hell , he did it with style . For all that , he 'd never been unkind to Faith , the way some of the people in town had . His sister , Monica , had once spat in their direction when Faith and Jodie had met her on the sidewalk . Faith was glad that Monica was in New Orleans at some fancy private girls ' school , and was n't home very often even during the summer , because she was visiting with friends . On the other hand , Faith 's heart had bled for months when Gray had gone off to LSU ; Baton Rouge was n't that far away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , and came home only on the holidays . Whenever she knew he was home , Faith tried to hang around town where she might catch a glimpse of him , strolling with the indolent grace of a big cat , so tall and strong and dangerously exciting . Now that it was summer , he spent a lot of time at the lake , which was one of the reasons for Faith 's afternoon expedition through the woods . The lake was a private one , over two thousand acres , and totally contained by Rouillard land . It was long and irregularly shaped , with several curves in it ; broad and fairly shallow in some places , narrow and deep in others . The big , white Rouillard mansion was to the east of it , the Devlin shack on the west , but neither was actually on the lakeshore . The only house on the lake was the Rouillard summerhouse , a white , one-story house with two bedrooms , a kitchen , a living room , and a screened-in porch that totally encircled it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a brick barbecue pit had been built there . Sometimes , during the summer , Gray and his friends would gather there for a rowdy afternoon of swimming and boating , and Faith would slip along the edge of the woods so she could watch him to her heart 's content . Maybe he 'd be there today , she thought , aching with the sweet yearning that filled her every time she thought about him . It would be wonderful to see him twice in one day . She was barefoot , and her threadbare shorts left her skinny legs unprotected from scratches and snakes , but Faith was as at home in the woods as the other shy creatures ; she was n't worried about the snakes , and disregarded the scratches . Her long , dark red hair tended to hang untidily in her eyes and annoy her , so she had pulled it back and secured it with a rubber band . She slipped like a wraith through the trees , her big cat eyes dreamy as she pictured Gray in her mind . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her hiding in the bushes , or peeking out from behind a tree , and he 'd hold his hand out to her and say , " Why do n't you come out from there and have some fun with us ? " She lost herself in the delicious daydream of being part of that group of laughing , roughhousing , suntanned kids , of being one of those curvy girls in a brief bikini . Even before she got to the edge of the clearing where the summerhouse was , she could see the silver gleam of Gray 's Corvette parked in front of it , and her heart began the familiar violent pounding . He was here ! She slid cautiously behind the shelter of a big tree trunk , but after a moment she realized that she could n't hear anything . There were no splashing sounds , no yells or shrieks or giggles . Maybe he was fishing from the pier , or maybe he 'd taken the boat out . Faith moved closer , angling for a view of the pier , but the wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled her . If he 'd taken the boat out , there was no telling how long he 'd be gone , and she could n't stay there waiting for him . She ha d stolen this time for herself , but she had to get back soon and start cooking supper , and take care of Scottie . She was turning to go when a muted sound reached her ears and she stopped , head cocked to try to locate it . She left the edge of the woods and took a few steps into the clearing , closer to the house , and now she could hear a murmur of voices , too low and indistinct for her to understand . Instantly her heart swelled again ; he was here , after all . But he was inside the house ; it would be difficult to catch a glimpse of him from the woods . If she went closer , though , she could hear him , and that was all she required . Faith had the knack of small , wild things for silence . Her bare feet did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , trying to stay out of a direct line to any of the windows . The murmur of voices seemed to be coming from the back of the house , where the bedrooms were located . She reached the porch and squatted by the steps , her head cocked again as she tried to catch the words , but she could n't quite understand them . It was Gray 's voice , though ; the deep tones were unmistakable , at least to her . Then she heard a gasp , and a kind of moan , in a much lighter voice . Irresistibly drawn by curiosity and the lodestone of Gray 's voice , Faith eased out of her squatting position and cautiously tugged at the handle of the screen door . It was unlatched . She eased it open barely enough for a cat to slip through , and wriggled her own lithe , skinny body inside , then just as silently let the door close . Going down on hands and knees , she crawled across the plank porch to the open window of one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She heard another gasp . " Gray , " said the other voice , a girl 's voice , strained and shaking . " Shhh , shhh , " Gray murmured , the sound low and barely reaching Faith . He said something else , but the words did n't make any sense to her . They slid past her ears without triggering any understanding . Then he said , " Mon chre , " and the tumblers clicked into place . He was speaking French , she realized , and as soon as she did so , the words became clear , as if it had taken that small understanding for the sounds to find the needed rhythm in her brain . Though the Devlins were neither Cajun nor Creole , Faith understood most of what he was saying . The majority of the people in the parish spoke and understood French , in varying degrees . It sounded as if he were trying to coax a seared dog to him , Faith thought . His voice was warm and crooning , the words scattered with reassurances and endearments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still strained , but now there was a drugged undertone to it . Curious , Faith eased to the side and carefully moved her head so that one eye peeked around the frame of the open window . What she saw froze her to the spot . Gray and the girl were both naked on the bed , which was positioned with the headboard under the window on the adjoining wall . Neither of them was likely to see her , which was a stroke of fortune , because Faith could n't have moved then even if they had both looked straight at her . Gray was lying with his back to her , his left arm positioned under the girl 's tousled blond head . He was leaning over her in a way that made Faith catch her breath , for there was something both protective and predatory in him . He was kissing her , long kisses that left the room in silence except f or their deep sighs , and his right arm  --  it looked as if  --  he was  --  he shifted his position , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl 's naked thighs , right there on her kitty cat . Faith felt dizzy , and she realized that her chest hurt from holding her breath . Carefully she let it out , and rested her cheek against the white wood . She knew what they were doing . She was eleven , and she was n't a little girl anymore even if her breasts had n't started to grow yet . Several years ago she had heard Renee and Pa carrying on in their bedroom , and her oldest brother , Russ , had leeringly and graphically explained what was going on . She had seen dogs doing it , too , and heard cats screeching while they did it . The girl cried out , and Faith peeked again . Gray was on top of her now , still gently murmuring in French , cajoling , soothing . He told her how pretty she was , how much he wanted her , how hot and delicious she was . And as he talked , he was adjusting his position , reaching between their bodies with his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of the angle , Faith could n't see what he was doing , but she knew anyway . With a shock , she recognized the girl . Lindsey Partain ; her father was a lawyer in Prescott . " Gray ! " Lindsey cried , her voice tight with strain . " My God ! I ca n't  --  " Gray 's muscular buttocks tightened , and the girl arched beneath him , crying out again . But she was clinging to him , and the cry was one of intense pleasure . Her long legs lifted , one twining around his hip , the other hooking around his leg . He began moving slowly , his muscled young body rippling with power . The scene was raw and disturbing , but there was also a beauty t o it that kept Faith riveted . Gray was so big and strong , his darkly tanned body graceful and intensely masculine , while Lindsey was slim and shapely , delicately feminine in his grasp . He seemed to be taking such care of her , and she was enjoying it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head arched back and her hips lifting in time with his slow rhythm . Faith stared at them , her eyes burning . She was n't jealous . Gray was so far above her , and she was so young , that she had never thought of him in a romantic , possessive sense . Gray was the shining center of her universe , to be worshiped from afar , and she was giddily happy with the occasional glimpse of him . Today , when he had actually spoken to her , and touched her shirt , had been paradise . She could n't imagine herself in Lindsey 's place , lying naked in his arms , or even imagine what it felt like . Gray 's movements were getting faster , and the girl was crying out again as she strained up to him , her teeth clenched as if she were in pain , but instinctively Faith knew that she was n't . Gray was hammering at her now , his own head thrown back , long black hair damp at the temples and the ends sticking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a raw , deep sound burst from his throat . Faith 's heart was hammering , and her greenish cat eyes were huge as she ducked away from the window , slipping through the screen door and off the porch as silently as she had arrived . So that was what it was like . She had actually seen Gray doing it . Without his clothes , he was even more beautiful than she had imagined . He had n't made disgusting snorting pig noises the way Pa did , whenever he was sober enough to talk Renee into the be droom , which was n't very often for the past couple of years . If Gray 's father , Guy , was as beautiful doing it as Gray was , Faith thought fiercely , she did n't blame Renee for choosing him over Pa . She gained the safety of the woods and slipped silently through the trees . It was late , and she 'd likely get a belting from Pa when she got home , for not being there to start his supper and look after Scottie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be worth it . She had seen Gray . Exhausted , elated , shaking and breathing hard in the aftermath of orgasm , Gray lifted his head from the curve of Lindsey 's neck and shoulder . She was still gasping herself , her eyes closed . He had spent the better part of the afternoon seducing her , but it had been worth the effort . That long , slow buildup had made the sex even better than he 'd expected . A flash of color , a tiny movement in his peripheral vision , caught his attention and he turned his head toward the open window and the woods beyond the porch . He caught only a glimpse of a small , frail figure topped by dark red hair , but that was enough for him to identify the youngest Devlin girl . What was the kid doing wandering around the woods this far from their shack ? Gray did n't say anything to Lindsey , because she would panic if she thought someone might have seen her sneaking into the summerhouse with him , even if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was engaged to Dewayne Mouton , and she would n't take kindly to anything screwing that up , even her own screwing . The Moutons were n't as rich as the Rouillards  --  no one in this part of Louisiana was  --  but Lindsey knew she could handle Dewayne in a way she could never hope to do with Gray . Gray was the bigger catch , but he would n't be a very comfortable husband , and Lindsey was shrewd enough to know she did n't have a chance with him anyway . " What is it ? " she murmured now , stroking his shoulder . " Nothing . " He turned his head and kissed her , hard , then disengaged their bodies and sat up on the edge of the bed . " I just noticed how late it is . " Lindsey took a look out the window at the lengthening shadows , and sat up with a squeal . " My God , I 'm supposed to have dinner with the Moutons tonight ! I 'll never be able to get ready on time ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her scattered articles of clothing . Gray dressed in a more leisurely fashion , but his mind was still on the Devlin kid . Had she seen them , and if she had , would she say anything ? She was a strange little kid , shyer than her older sister , who was already showing signs of being as big a slut as their mother . But the younger one had wise old eyes in that thin kid 's face , eyes that reminded him of a cat 's eyes , hazel green with flecks of gold in them so that sometimes they were green and sometimes looked yellowish . He got the feeling that she did n't miss much . She would know that her mother was his father 's piece on the side , that the Devlins lived rent-free in that shack so Renee would be handy whenever Guy Rouillard wanted her . The kid would n't risk getting on the bad side of any Rouillard . Poor little skinny kid , with the fey eyes . She 'd been born into trash and would n't have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even wanted to . Amos Devlin was a mean drunk , and the two older boys , Russ and Nicky , were lazy , thieving bullies , as mean as their father and showing signs of turning into drunks as well . Her mother , Renee , liked the booze too , but she had n't let it get the upper hand on her the way it had on Amos . She was lush and beautiful , despite having borne five children , with the dark red hair that only her youngest daughter had inherited , as well as the green eyes and creamy , delicate skin . Renee was n't mean , like Amos , but she was n't much of a mother to those kids , either . All Renee cared about was getting screwed . The joke in the parish was that her heels were so round , she had been used as the pattern for Weebles . Unlike Weebles , however , Renee would stay down , as long as there was a man ready to crawl on top of her . She exuded sex , raunchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitch in heat . Jodie , the oldest girl , was pure jailbait , already on the lookout for any hard cock she could get . She had Renee 's singlemindedness when it came to sex , and he very much doubted that she was still a virgin , though she was only in junior high . She kept offering it to him , but Gray was n't the least bit tempted . He 'd rather screw a snake than Jodie Devlin . The youngest Devlin boy was retarded . Gray had only seen him once or twice , and each time he had been clinging to the youngest girl 's legs  --  what was her name , damn it ? Something he 'd thought a minute ago had reminded him of it . Fay ? Fay with the fey eyes ? No , it was something else , but like that  --  Faith . That was it . Funny name for a Devlin , since neither Amos nor Renee was the least bit religious . With a family like that , the kid was doomed . In another couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sister 's footsteps , because she would n't know any better . And even if she did know better , all the boys would come sniffing around her anyway , just because her name was Devlin , and she would n't hold out for long . The whole parish knew that his father was screwing Renee , had been for years . As much as Gray loved his mother , he figured he could n't blame Guy for going elsewhere ; God knows , his mother did n't . Noelle was the least physical person Gray had ever seen . At thirty-nine , she was still as cool and lovely as a Madonna , unfailingly composed and remote . She did n't like to be touched , even by her children . The wonder was that she 'd even had children . Of course Guy was n't faithful , had never been , much to Noelle 's relief . Guy Rouillard was hot-blooded and lusty , and he 'd found his way into a lot of beds before settling , more or less , on Renee Devlin . But Guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gray knew he would never leave her , especially not for a cheap slut like Renee . The only person upset by the arrangement , apparently , was his sister , Monica . Starved by Noelle 's emotional distance , Monica doted on her father , and was fiercely jealous of Renee , both on behalf of her mother and because Guy spent so much time with Renee . It was a lot calmer around the house now that Monica had gone away to school and become involved with her friends there . " Gray , hurry , " Lindsey begged frantically . He shoved his arms into his shirtsleeves , but disdained to button the garment , leaving it hanging open . " I 'm ready . " He kissed her , and patted her butt . " Do n't get your feathers ruffled , chrie . All you have to do is change clothes . The rest of you looks beautiful just as you are . " She smiled , pleased by the compliment , and calmed down . " When can we do this again ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud . It had taken him most of the summer to get into her pants , but now she did n't want to waste any more time . Perversely , now that he 'd had her , much of his ruthless determination had faded . " I do n't know , " he said lazily . " I have to report back to school soon , for football practice . " To her credit , she did n't pout . Instead she tossed her head so the wind lifted her hair as the Corvette streaked down the private road toward the highway , and smiled at him . " Any time . " She was a year older than he was , and had her own share of confidence . The Corvette skidded into the highway , the tires grabbing asphalt . Lindsey laughed as Gray handled the powerful car with ease . " I 'll have you home in five minutes , " he promised . He did n't want anything to interfere with her engagement to Dewayne , either . He thought of skinny little Faith Devlin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't be wandering around alone in the woods like that . She could get hurt , or lost . Worse , though this was private land , the lake drew the local high school boys like a magnet , and Gray had no illusions about teenage boys when they were in a pack . If they ran across Faith , they might not stop to think about how young she was , only that she was a Devlin . Little Red would n't have a chance against the wolves . Someone needed to keep a closer eye on the kid .
