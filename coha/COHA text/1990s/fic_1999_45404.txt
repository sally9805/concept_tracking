In 1993 or 1994 , one or the other , I was walking down an aisle in a diner-style place in Burlington , Vermont , called Pepper 's Memphis Barbeque , and that was when I saw Nancy crying . That was when it started . I still live in Burlington but Pepper 's is long gone now . Long gone . The volume outlets and the big theme complexes came in one by one and gradually put most of the local concerns in the shade . How could a mom-and-pop rib joint compete against restaurants as limitless as an amusement park ? <p> But like I say , I was walking to my seat at Pepper 's , and I was just thirty-two years old in that year , when the city was still ringed with low hills and free-range cows . Vee was thirty , at home thinking up better , slipperier reasons for us to have children . Such as , They 're the purest expression of hope and they take care of you when you 're old and maybe ca n't even drive anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most oddly moving : Vermont is the last , good place to multiply , Paul . In those days , she schemed for both of us . I had yet to be unfaithful , and she had yet to place my infidelity in the satin-lined jewelry box of her memory , for safekeeping . <p> I looked up that night and saw this picture on the giant overhead television . With all the chrome in the diner , you got the real sense that it was beaming at you , especially at night . All the coat racks and railings and stools had these little blue and red lightsmears on them , rolling like paint balls . And there was , this night , a picture of a figure skater just absolutely sobbing . She was gorgeous , even with her face wrenched , tears actually streaming in visible streams . Black leotard , ebony hair pulled tight back to her head . Cheekbones that could slice an apple . Suggestive even then of Walt Disney 's Snow White , but brought up out of the cryogenic sleep of animation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscled , ripe and sweet as a mango , sitting and sobbing . In a leotard . <p> I remember registering the beauty-getting hit with it hard enough to stop the walk to my table so that I just stood behind guys at the counter eating-and still I remember thinking that the woman 's nostrils were just slightly larger , and several more degrees to the vertical , than they should have been . It was all pretty much immediate , these impressions . The nostrils just , just , just barely marred everything . You could just about see up inside her face . <p> She was sobbing because she was at the Olympic Trials for the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer , Norway-the trials were here in the United States somewhere though . I do n't remember where . Possibly L.A. Wherever , she had been struck on the knee by some guy with a long hard object like a pipe or a foot-and-a-half long blackjack , the kind of thing that would be made by security companies in northern Virginia specifically to smash knees . Broadcasters would later be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember what term they shook hands on . Let 's say club . Her left knee was the target , I remember that perfectly . The guy with the club walked up and just hammered her once on that knee and sprinted . When I saw it , about eight or ten minutes later , it was swollen and shot through already with blue dead blood . And the left knee of course was her push-off knee , the one that broke gravity for her . <p> I saw this knee in very bright light against a tile floor and wall there wherever she was . I was , in effect , four feet from the knee , looking down . She was looking up at me and crying and saying , why me , over and over again . Why me ? Later on it came to seem as though she had sobbed it out a million times . This was Nancy . Every once in a while the camera would shift emphasis , and you 'd get a good look at the right knee , the unviolated one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwell on the knee , I know , but what I 'm trying to do is give you a sense of where we were with media at that point . It was the frontier then , people . The public consciousness flashed on weird things . There were no formulae in place . No real system had been implemented . A kid down a well , or some young knee , beached whalesall of a sudden there would be diagrams and translations of the knee or the mammal into other languages and forms . You 'd get a schematic of the joint or the well , and if people perked up , if sets went on worldwide , then you got more . It was all about number of sets . It was more organic . It was like a weather front then , very slowly thrashing around and settling according to its own rumbling , blaspheming physics over the landscape . <p> Sometimes there was just a sprinkling of something , but if the conditions held somehow , the sets and late-breaking facts and possible storylines , all of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it you were in it . You were drenched and soaked through with it , eyes , ears , mouth , lungs . But it was also weather you 'd asked for , somehow . You got pounded with what you wanted . You got left homeless , it rained so much and so hard and so long with what you 'd signaled you wanted . <p> It was my first look at Nancy . I thought she was quite attractive . None of the first newscasts really showed Tonya . Tonya was not yet an option . Say it 's mud season . Vee is the sort of woman who , if she has asked me not to track mud into the house because of a new mint-green oriental rug and I forget , say , will take the muddy Timberland boots , knot the laces together and wrench them tight , walk out into the front yard and launch the boots up onto the peak of our bungalow roof . She is a small woman but has a good arm and a temper like fire in the hole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boots up there through summer and the next winter , and when the wind finally brings them down into the driveway the following spring , will drive over them and come to find comfort in the small jolt to the truck 's carriage . I have the ability to decide to die before changing my mind on random matters . <p> We 're both the kind of people , then , who will eventually laugh hysterically and simultaneously , two and a half years later , coming home from the Cineplex , when the headlights pick out the flattened brown fragments of our idiocy squatting in the drive . <p> When finally some itinerant black dog carries them away altogether , we go on as before . We have better things to do than wonder about where they went . At the breakfast table one morning-seven days before Nancy 's knee pushed its way into the world 's eye-Vee cleared her throat and hitched her chair closer to the table . She said , " Paul , I do n't want to get into it again , because we both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to have a baby . I will give birth next year . " <p> I did n't say anything . She was prophesying . I just listened . <p> " I really thought about how I feel and I decided that I can give you until the end of the month to decide if you want to be the father . And after that , if you decide you do n't want to be the father , I can wait two months for you to decide whether you want to stay married to me and help me raise it . " She looked right at me the whole time she said it . It was fundamentally different than boots on roofs . This introduced the idea of no roof at all , no us waiting one another out . <p> She was sawing into a half of grapefruit , sectioning it . Her preparations for this antidiscussion were implicit in that geometry . It was like an interactive computer game she 'd written . If I said one thing , she 'd argue around one side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child . If I said another , she 'd go the other way around , sawing her way through the pink pulp and flesh . The story ended with a child . <p> Vee was wearing a blue silk kimono her sister had given her for Christmas two years before , and her black hair was brushed and hanging onto the silk at the swell of her breasts , and it was implicit that that was an option too , both of us calling in sick , making love , making a child , whispering soft , binding words to one another . She licked her knife , spread some sugar onto the fruit . " I mean , it 's not an ultimatum , Paul . I know it has to sound like that but it is n't at all . It 's just what I 'm gon na do , for me . " <p> I had a bite of a bagel . The bagel was blameless . I would put that grapefruit down the Insinkerator when all was said and done , shove it into the toothless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> I said , " Fine . I 'll let you know in a month . " <p> Vee paused for a second , and then pushed another piece of the tart fruit into her mouth . " Well , it 's November , so . It 's just thirty days . " She had evidently been working the calendar , figuring trimesters . <p> " Let 's not get into it , " I said flatly to her . " I thought that was the rule . We have to go to work . How are we supposed to go through the day ? " <p> " I 'm not getting into it , " she shot back . " November 's thirty days long . I did n't make it up . It 's a fact . " <p> " Yeah , well , facts are getting into it . People have different facts . " <p> She closed the kimono more tightly around her throat . So that was no longer an option . " Are you going to eat that grapefruit ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance in hell . " <p> " Fine . " She reached over and took my half , sugared it , and began spooning its sections up into her mouth . It was the same methodical geometry , even with my half . The story still ended with her having a child . <p> With her mouth jammed full , she said , " I should start eating more anyway . " <p> It was n't all cause-and-effect , or logic-driven . I 'd never say that . Stuff happened , at that point , unexpected stuff . Sets went on . More stuff came and the story built on a foundation of sex or violence or depravity and towered up over everything and came to matter to people , people here and in Norway and Belarus . And what you had going in your own life sometimes started twining around it like a vine . Pretty soon you could n't separate them and you could n't uproot them . Organic says it best . Look at it this way : Orson Welles had people swan-diving out of skyscrapers using just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It turned out , of course-after Tonya made it onto the Olympic team-that the assailant who 'd taken Nancy out of the running had been working in concert with Tonya 's own hulking bodyguard . It had been a hit , then , something calculated and for-profit , not some inscrutable crazy . And believe me , sets went on , the billion flowers bloomed . And from them a heavy perfume of vilification went up over the continental United States : Tonya was the dragon girl who had organized it all , who had deployed a small squad of thuggish trailer-park types , as a way of getting a shot at the gold she clearly coveted . <p> Sure , she was an acknowledged powerhouse on the ice . She was the only woman ever to add a triple axel to her routine-the gift of her thick torso and legs like sycamores-but she had neither the grace nor the technique nor the money nor the discipline to make it onto the U.S. figure skating team with Nancy standing in her way . She was an asthmatic and claimed she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asthmatic and she smoked . A lot . Her mascara looked like it had been applied with a Water Pik . <p> Around that time I remember a young woman walking into the law office where she and I were both then non-equity partners and , as she took her coat and gloves off , remarking to everyone , unable to contain it anymore , " Is n't Tonya just the skankiest tramp you ever saw in your life ? " No one needed a last name ; no one needed to have the word skanky defined for them . <p> At sometime after four o'clock that night , that morning , I dreamt that a man in black clothing had snuck into our bedroom and thrust his head up into my face and then suddenly struck my leg with a long , black-handled piece of metal . He pounded the pad of my thigh , and I tried to move but felt only the warped paralysis of sleep . I tried to scream for reporters , but nothing answered my desire to scream . And then I woke up suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When she saw my eyes fly open , she pulled her hand back . She was sitting in a naked huddle , outside the covers . She was sobbing , her face was wet , and it glowed green with the half-light of the digital clock on the bedside . <p> Her eyes were wide , puffy-lidded and tortured . " How can you just sleep ? " she hissed at me . " And just-wait around , and let the whole entire day go by and not say anything ! All through dinner , the whole meal ! " <p> " About what ? What are you talking about ? Why are you even up and- " <p> " You 're just going to let the whole month go by and not say one word about the baby , this baby that 's coming one way or the other . Are n't you ? Are n't you ? " She seemed genuinely horrified . <p> I was fully awake and sitting up by then , comforter pulled around me like bulletproofing . In the dark , the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You gave me a month , right Vee ? So it 's been , like , a week . Come on . " <p> Vee leaned down and hissed at me again . " Nine days , Paul . It 's been nine days and you have n't said anything . My God , Paul , what do you think I 'm made of ? How much do you think you can torture me with silence and-and pretending like it does n't matter to you that this might wreck everything ? " <p> " Vee , what is the matter with you ? You gave me thirty days to think about it and get back to you- " <p> " Get back to me , " she repeated , struggling with emotion . " What am I , a client ? A business contact or something ? Somebody who 's trying to lowball you on a damage negotiation ? Jesus , Paul , that 's sick . Oh my God . " <p> " Vee , you 're not thinking about it from my point of view . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said fine . I 've been thinking about what to do about all of this . And then I wake up and you 're punching me . What 's normal about that ? " <p> *You know what 's normal ? " Vee asked , much more quietly , almost inaudibly . She pushed her hair back out of her face . All her anger and energy seemed to have dissipated . " Forget everything else . Forget there 's even two sides to the issue . Normal is getting married , committing for life , buying a house , making love , having a child , raising the child , protecting it , and loving each other . And it keeps you from being a lonely , isolated person . And , I mean , everybody does it . Everybody in every country in the world just rolls with it and does it , and has a big family Christmas-or holidays or whatever the hell they have-and kids around the dinner table . And they do it because it 's the only way that makes sense . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say you could see yourself with four kids , one of each sex and one to spare of each sex , like a little economy pack . You did , that time in Montpelier with your family . " <p> She started to cry , and I could tell she was cold outside the covers , but watching her body shake I could n't bring myself to reach for her . It was the grapefruit design all over again . It all smacked of scripting . Her body wanted a child . It was questing blindly for that , using big bad rhythms to try to make it so , and I could n't bring myself to bring it nearer to me . <p> " You changed your mind about it , you did , " she was saying through her tears , kneading the comforter , almost mumbling . " You did . You changed . I ca n't believe I was the one to marry someone who says children make him claustrophobic . I ca n't believe it was me . " <p> " Vee , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head up and looked at me as she cried , dim green tears wetting her freckled chest . The damp breasts were an indictment , hanging there . " Why me ? " <p> She asked . The question did n't seem directed to me , necessarily , but to anyone , to the world . " Why me ? " <p> But no one-not the FBI , not the American Figure Skating Association or the Olympic Committee itself-could make the hulking bodyguard or Tonya 's leather-jacketed boyfriend admit that she 'd known anything about it . Oh , the authorities tried . They threatened the two with hard time , twenty-five years of it , in the deepest Federal hole available . And we tried to help . The whole country leaned on those two , and screw due process . They could n't move without understanding just how completely we despised them . If they cracked open a fortune cookie , it carried a story about just precisely how much we despised them . We sent messages that producers should go ahead and schedule hour-long programs investigating their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thugs , they had heart . They did n't drop word one on Tonya . And in lieu of that word , the Committee had to let her skate at Lillehammer , either that or face a multi-million-dollar lawsuit by Tonya herself , who by now had some very classy legal help . <p> And then a couple of things happened . For one , Nancy went ballistic when she heard that Tonya was also going to be in Lillehammer . Nancy was not too attractive when she had her Irish up ; it brought a previously unheard nasality to her voice , an odd new whine , and her anger only exacerbated the nostril situation . For another , we started to get some real , deep biography on Tonya . She had never had the skatingfriendly environment , parents in mini-vans carting her to practice and forgoing vacations to hire top-flight coaches . As we had suspected , she 'd lied and cheated to get the odd hour here and there at the local hockey rink ; we saw the lightless trailer she 'd grown up in , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick thing for the spangled costumes , the little white skates . <p> And then there was this live footage of Tonya , who had been holed up inside a friend 's apartment ringed with media , sprinting in bare feet to keep her pickup truck from being towed . It had been parked in a No Parking zone , of course . I remember a friend calling me from California and saying that he thought she had heart , whereas Nancy was a spoiled cream puff . He told me in so many words that he had actually had a successful sexual fantasy concerning the bare feet . <p> I remember I had no trouble believing him . You could feel the world slowing , reversing , balancing on the verge of embracing Tonya . <p> Those thirty odd days were not all splattered with battery acid . Vee surprised me one afternoon , maybe Day Sixteen , by coming to pick me up at my office for lunch . I was up to my elbows in a sexual harassment case . Our client 's supervisor had been sending her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'd spent the morning going through them , looking for particularly salacious freezeframes . I showed Vee the last of these , an over-the-shoulder , come-hither look from the Stairmaster . <p> " Do n't you go changing , big guy , " Vee said to the graying man on the screen . When we got out onto the street , she pulled a rose from her overcoat pocket , stem broken off to just a one-thorn nubbin . She removed the last thorn , and then put it in my overcoat pocket . She took my arm . It was the sort of bright , expectant November day that smells of snow but never pays off . People run around town laughing , looking up and dodging through their errands , waiting to be smote . Winter enforces a certain clarity , on those days . <p> While we were waiting for our sandwiches , Vee suddenly got up and came around and sat on my side of the booth . She had on an oversized white wool sweater , and inside it she looked raven-haired and red-cheeked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drumming me further toward the wall . <p> " Hey , " I said , laughing . <p> " I 'm eating over here , " she announced . <p> " I guess so , " I said . <p> " I 'm feeling sentimental today . You know , like I do sometimes . " <p> " Me too , " I said . And it was true . The harassment case in general and the Stairmaster shot in particular had been turning my stomach . Seeing her reminded me how very glad I was that no one was pressuring her to view them as they exercised , and how glad I was that I was n't someone who needed to be viewed . <p> The waiter came back and looked at us . Vee had her arm around my shoulders , and I had my hand across her lap , holding her knee . We looked up at him . " Is someone else going to be joining you ? " he asked . <p> Vee tossed her hair out of her face and fixed him with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up , OK , because " - and at that point we both started giggling , almost too loudly for her to finish- " because we 're just trying to have a nice afternoon here , OK , no questions asked . " <p> She turned to me and she had this spritish grin , and she mashed her lipsticked mouth against mine . It was a long kiss , considering , long enough for the young waiter to mumble " whatever " and to back away from our table . It was one of our three best lunches ever . <p> But by two days later , an ice storm had cleared the Adirondacks and Lake Champlain , and Vee and I were back at it , at it like wolverines . Burlington became a purgatory of ice-webbed trees that collapsed into power lines . <p> It was in that weather that Vee boarded a TurboProp for her sister 's house in North Carolina , leaving a memo message on the answering machine that said , in part , " I 'll be back when time 's up . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have next year . " There was the sound of her clearing her throat . " I feel like someday I 'll have to explain why I was sleeping with the Devil 's advocate . " <p> The lawyers for the graying twitch on the Stairmaster faxed over an offer several days later , out of the blue . I 'd had a courier bring over some color copies of the stills I 'd isolated , just to make clear where our focus would be . The twitch 's lawyers were not idiots , and they settled immediately for some big dollars . My firm threw a little party that night at a Greek restaurant downtown . But all the congratulations just churned up my desire for something else , something undefined and composed of ghost elements . I knew clearly only that I did n't want to go home to the empty house and the boxed-in feeling I had there . I could n't face the memo light still blinking on the answering machine . <p> Frannie O 's was a bar out near the airport , the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hats or listens to country music-of a country roadhouse . It was a big place that smelled of beer and resignation and hard luck . Planes droned overhead . I had been there once , on a twelve-bar stint for a friend 's stag party . It seemed like the place to go , who can say why . Men there yelled unself-consciously at the television , and women brought their own pool cues and picked lint off the felt with silk-wrapped nails . <p> Nancy and Tonya were on the television , as they had been at the restaurant party beforehand . Each was now under the gun , timewise : Nancy 's knee had to shrink to a medically acceptable size before she would be allowed to skate in Lillehammer , and Tonya was trying to stave off charges of conspiracy that would lead to her being dropped from the U.S. team . <p> I watched as a doctor , using a model powered by a hydraulic pump , demonstrated how protective fluid had flooded Nancy 's knee at the precise moment of impact . Guys at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fluid . <p> There were four televisions in the place , one hung in each corner , and I turned to glance at the set behind me . Sitting beneath it was a woman with her blond hair pulled back tight , accentuating the smooth , bland expanse of her face . She had on a burgundy Danskin , and her arms and shoulders bulged up beneath it . Her mascara looked like it had been applied with a Water Pik . It was Tonya . <p> The bartender saw me staring . " Looks a hell of a lot like her , do n't she ? " he murmured . At that point , he did n't even need the first name ; a pronoun served . Tonya was the universal proper noun . Unless otherwise indicated , she was she . <p> She also saw me looking and looked away , lit a cigarette . I felt the churning again , the shapeless desire . It felt like as soon as I took a breath , someone pumped the air out of my lungs . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now it showed an attorney , discussing conspiracy law . <p> " What 's she drinking ? " I asked the bartender , impulsively . <p> " Kamikaze , " he said , " poured out over ice . " He looked over at her again , up to the television , down at my credit card . " How about I mix you up a pitcher ? " <p> When she 'd topped her drink off with the cold new pitcher of Kamikazes , she took a sip , then motioned for me to have a seat . I saw guys at the bar glancing over at us . Close up , her makeup seemed heavier , crumbly , which you expected , but her actual skin tone was softer and finer , which you did n't . <p> " Are n't you going to ask me whether I did it ? " she asked suddenly . She smiled when she said it , and you could almost see the little trailer park girl in her face , the girl who 'd just wanted to skate because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go ahead . " <p> " Did what ? " <p> " Had her whacked in the knee . Are n't you curious ? " <p> " Maybe . " " Well maybe I did then . Maybe sometimes you got ta jump on an opportunity . How many people win a gold medal ? Even get the chance ? " <p> " I do n't know , " I said . I shifted in my seat ; I realized I 'd sat down in front of her the way I usually sat in front of the television , hunched forward a little , squinting . <p> " What 's your name ? " <p> " Do n't you know ? " she asked , again giving the little girl smile , but now shot through with sponsorships and domineering coaches and boyfriends looking for a ride to the world of private parties . " Bet you know if you think real hard . Smart guy like you . " <p> " I do n't think so , " I said , smiling , shaking my head . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I said with my face , I 'm interested in the real you , not her . <p> " Tonya , " she said after a long pause . You 're not interested in me , her face said back to me . " It 's weird . Since it happened , nothing 's the same . I do n't buy my own drinks anymore . There 's a big fuss in stores . A bus goes by and people riding on it point at me and wave , blow me kisses , give me the finger . " She looked at me , looked me up and down . " Guys in suits come over to say hello . Guys with nice dimples . Pretty green ties . " <p> " Yeah , I can see how it might be kind of fun . But do n't you get tired of people confusing you with her ? " <p> " Her ? " she repeated , giving me a mock-quizzical look . She took a long pull at her drink . Then she topped off her glass and reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her trailer was stuck down in a ravine off the small dirt road that leads to Jericho from Route I5 . It was backed up against a stand of birch and maple , looked like it had been thrown there by the hand of a giant child . There was a tracing of snow here and there . A rickety , undersized swingset stood off to one side of the drive . <p> I got out of my car , and she got out of her pickup and threw her cigarette uncertainly toward the ground . " This is n't my house , " she said to me in a loud voice , walking toward a set of makeshift wooden steps that led to the front door . " I 'm just hiding out here from all the media people . " <p> She snapped on the kitchen light once we were inside , and I could see how small the place really was , railway-compartment small . " Nobody 's home , " she explained , " it 's nice to have a quiet place to come back to after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer out from the refrigerator , but did n't hand one to me . Instead , she gave me a look and kept walking through the kitchen , through the living room toward a bedroom , door flung open , at the far end . I could see a bed with its sheets and blankets pulled to the floor . She began to laugh , holding the beer cans aloft and pirouetting down the cramped hallway . <p> As we neared the bedroom , I passed another open door in the hallway and even with the lights off I could see it was a child 's room . I could see shadows of stuffed animals , and beside a small dresser the shadows of boots , mittens , sled . And tumbled against the injection-molded wall of the room , ice skates . <p> " That stuff was here when I got here , somebody 's kid 's stuff , " Tonya said , quickly pulling the door shut . " I just left it . I 'll be on a plane to Norway in a couple weeks . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed me on the mouth . It tasted like cigarettes . <p> " What do I care ? " she said . " I 'm thinking nothing but medals . Gold and silver . And covers of cereal boxes . " <p> Only once , during that three or four hours , did we really look at one another , although I watched her the whole time . I admit to that , the watching . But the time we really looked at one another was when she was undoing my belt buckle . She looked up at me as her fingers worked and her face said , I 'm not stupid , I know what it is . I 'm not expecting you to insist on my real name , to become real in my life . I 'm not looking for you to step-father my daughter . <p> My sense of self-loathing was so strong by the time I reached Burlington that I was surprised when the garage door responded to my touch on the opener , when it took me inside its broom-swept womb . I smelled of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfume . I showered and got into bed . There was no new message from Vee . I cried like a child alone in a hurricane cellar . I told myself that it had n't really been her , but I could n't be sure . I could n't be certain that klieg lights and satellite links would n't mushroom across the lawn . <p> I had left millions of small parts of myself inside her , and I wanted them back more than I have ever wanted anything in my life . I wanted somehow to call them home , undisseminate them . I wanted Vee pre-Tonya . <p> Everything I 've explained to you I explained to Vee . I have a weak stomach when it comes to guilt . She had been back from North Carolina for about a week when I realized I could never live with the secret sealed inside me , leaking acid . The thirtyday deadline had come and gone , without Vee seeming to care about it anymore . It was as though it had vanished from the radar screen , the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fighting anymore added to my self-loathing and I sat her down on the couch one night and told her everything I 've just told you , about Tonya and the world impulse , my claustrophobia over the baby issue , how I 'd burst into tears when I got home from Jericho that night . <p> I suppose somewhere in the back of my mind I thought I could simply agree to a child by way of reconciliation . I guess I thought I could agree to that , and we would eventually say the soft , binding words to one another that seal a family . But Vee hardly reacted . She gave me a hard , unreadable look . It was like she was struggling through the fine-print of our insurance policy . She showed no anger , only this flat determination not to be duped , to have it straight in her mind . <p> " So that makes me Nancy , then , " she said finally . " Little miss princess . That 's what you 're saying . Is n't it , Paul ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vee , how can you say that ? " <p> " The goody-two-shoes . " <p> " No , Vee . It was n't about goody-two-shoes . Vee . Do n't think that . " <p> " The whiner . " She reached out and patted my face , shaking her head . " Do n't go changing , " she said . And then she got up and went in the spare room , and I heard the sewing machine start up , tear into a seam . And that was it , that was all there was to our talk , my confession . I sat in front of the television most of the night , in disbelief . <p> After she went to sleep I poked my head into the spare room and saw that she was making baby clothes , little sky-blue pajamas and hats and some sort of elongated sack that must have been the beginnings of a jumper . It was the first time in my life I 'd ever been aware of a jumper , but I remember looking at it with some respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had determination in the weave . <p> You know , things just come to their own necessary final resting places , all stories seek their own levels near the finish . Neither Nancy nor Tonya won the gold in Lillehammer . Some big-eyed , tiny-boned Eastern European girl walked away with it , because she tore up the ice and because clearly the international judges had had enough of the two catty American girls trailed by all the cameras and the boom mikes . <p> As she 'd foretold , Vee began to swell , her stomach grew round and tight as a melon . At the close of nine months she gave birth , and I was standing at the foot of the bed , clutching her ankle , to watch this . <p> After the baby came , and we 'd settled clumsily into parenthood , Vee sat me down on the couch one night and told me a story of her own about her two weeks in North Carolina . She 'd met a Chapel Hill businessman at the airport , and this man had a charismatic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vee called him . His hair was silver , and there were small , kind folds of skin beneath his eyes . He reminded her strongly of a newly elected president whose face was all over the media in those days , when she saw him sitting in the airport lounge . He was a big man , given to hugging and to talking about family , those things she missed in me . " He talked about the future like it was a fresh new exciting place , " Vee whispered to me , hand on my knee , patting me reassuringly every once in awhile . I just listened . " And I realized that that 's what it 's all about , Paul , the future . And kids are how you get there . It 's what I was trying to say all along . " <p> She described his house as almost a mansion , a great white house set back behind wrought iron and surrounded by forest . She and her sister had gone there for dinner . He 'd spent much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants , wooing her , and eventually she had felt the world impulse herself . <p> For that reason my own infidelity had simply preceded and validated her own . It had removed the cloud of guilt from above her quickening child , and so ironically she came to prize it above most other things . <p> I 've never known if that story is true or false , whether it happened or whether Vee devised it to haunt me . It 's a final question that I will never , never ask , and Vee will never offer to tell , and we take security in the arrangement . <p> In one way it does n't matter in the slightest-our son is nearing forty now , and no matter who he resembles or does n't , some nights when he 's been over to dinner and his car pulls out of our driveway to head back to Rutland , I feel a horrible tearing across my chest , I love him so dearly . <p> But in other ways it does matter because I think that what happened to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of what happened to New England , and to the rest of us . We 'd lost the sense of how good we had it . All of a sudden we had so many options we could never be satisfied . And so we gave everything up to the builders and the theme developers , with the idea that they 'd go ahead and construct brand new stories all around us . I think a lot about that these days . <p> We learned eventually , Vee and I learned , everybody learned . <p> And so now it 's all controlled at higher levels for us . It 's not about number of sets anymore , no more of that anarchy . We know we 're being shown by and large what 's good for us , Vermont and everywhere else . We know it 'll rain only as long and as plentifully as is absolutely necessary , and not a drop more , and we 're happier this way , believe me when I tell you . <p>           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
