<p> Instead of complaining about unruly behavior on school buses and doing nothing , I think parents need to get on the bus . Put parents on as monitors so the driver is free to drive and force the parents of unruly students to ride with them to retain their bus privileges . JULIE MURRAY , Lithia Springs Teen 's death was tragic for both families <p> I am deeply saddened to learn of the death of Josh Belluardo . His death was needless and never should have happened . I ca n't figure out why no one ever sought to discipline his 15-year-old assailant from the beginning , before a life that held so much promise was wasted for no reason . What could cause a 15-year-old to possess such anger and why no one thought to intervene is a mystery to me . The 15-year-old needs help ; because of his actions two families will forever be shattered . <p> I am happy to hear the one bright side of this , with Josh 's organs having been passed on so another life can be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this decision in their time of loss . My prayers go out to both families . You have n't been forgotten . GEORGE S. ELFINGTON , Norcross Bullying will continue as long as adults do nothing <p> I have just finished reading the article by Glenn Hannigan in the Cherokee edition of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution ( " Booth student tragedy recalls Brian 's pain , " Thursday , Nov. 5 , 1998 ) . I feel compelled to relate two stories that unfortunately are all too similar to the recent unfortunate occurrences in Cherokee County . Fortunately , the results were not tragic . These are accounts of two incidents in which I was involved : once as the person being assaulted , the other as the person who tried , somewhat in vain , to do something about it . <p> When I was 14 and growing up in a suburb approximately 15 miles south of Boston , I was fortunate enough to be able to attend a very good private school in Dorchester , Mass . However , to get to and from school meant that I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARTA in Atlanta ) . If anyone is familiar with the Boston subways , this in and of itself can be a scary experience at times . Luckily , more often than not it was an uneventful experience . <p> During my freshman year , the last leg of my ride home involved taking a bus from the most southern train station to my hometown  --  about a 40-minute ride . It was virtually the same people each day that rode the bus . I normally had a friend who attended the same school riding the bus with me . At some point during the school year , we began to experience problems with two boys ( juniors ) from another school , also in Boston . We did not know them , they did not know us . Apparently , the taunting began initially because we attended a " rival " school . The problems began with quiet taunting , teasing , etc . <p> As weeks went by , the extent of the taunting became more intimidating . In an attempt to avoid the continuation of this relentless bullying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle section of the bus , near an adult if possible . The boy still continued to yell things at me from the back of the bus . <p> One afternoon , as the boy was walking down the aisle to get off at his stop , he either punched me in the back of the head or elbowed me . I could not tell , as he hit me from behind unexpectedly . It hurt a LOT , and I finally had lost it . I got up out of my seat , ran down the aisle and punched him in the head . I then dragged him to the back of the bus and pinned him on the back seat . A struggle ensued , and let 's leave it that he came out on the short end . After that day , he never again rode that bus . <p> I will never forget how I felt up until that point . Aside from the initial fear , anxiety , frustration and anger , I felt , and still feel now , a sense of betrayal by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what was going on , and never did anything to stop it . I will never forget those feelings . <p> I am now 35 years old and live in the Towne Lake area . Three years ago , I had left my house to walk to our neighborhood tennis courts for an ALTA practice . As was my habit , I arrived about 15 minutes early to warm up . Upon my arrival , I noticed a large group of teens in a circle , and there was obviously some type of argument or fight taking place . As I got closer , I noticed that one teen had a smaller boy against a fence , and was beating him up pretty badly . The boy was crying , and the group around them was egging the fight on . There were also a couple of boys who jumped in and took a few shots as well ( I found out later that the boy being beaten was 12 , and the others were between 12 and 18 ) . I immediately jumped through the crowd to break the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group . <p> There were approximately 10 boys and four girls in the group . One of the girls I recognized as the daughter of a former high-ranking city police officer who lived adjacent to the tennis courts , and this surprised me . Many of the boys were swearing at me , and at one point the oldest in the group approached me as if to fight with me . I got them to keep their distance , but I had to be at least as verbal as they were to make that happen . Though I am 6 feet tall and 200 pounds , there were many more of them . Soon after , the police arrived at the request of a neighbor who had seen what was transpiring and called 911 . <p> I could not believe what would occur next . I was admonished for the way I spoke to the group to keep them at bay ( this at the request of some of the parents ) , and the boy I assisted was left at the tennis courts with me . No offer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ended up walking him home . I also made it a point to call the officer from the neighborhood to let him know what had occurred . His response was " Kids will be kids . " Unbelievable . He could n't have cared less . <p> On a positive note , the boy is now 16 or so , and has become a great friend in the neighborhood . He always comes to watch and/or participate in our tennis practices  --  just an all-around great kid . I do n't know what we can do to get people to understand the seriousness of these types of things . Even when you try , it seems like it 's all for nought . <p> I wish you luck in your endeavors to bring light to these unfortunate occurrences . God bless . DAN MURPHY , Woodstock Seek Board of Education support for Wyngate park <p> A group of citizens has requested that the Cherokee Board of Education allow the 20 acres of Board of Education property in Wyngate to be developed as a nature park . Over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the groundwork for this pristine property to be converted into a nature park . <p> Originally , the property was donated to the Board of Education for use as a school site . Over the years , opinion has developed that this would not be a good location because of its lack of accessibility and the presence of wetlands . The proposed park would contain a pond , an open field , wildlife feeding and viewing areas , and trails for walking and biking . It would link to Corps of Engineers property along Lake Allatoona tributaries for extended walking and biking trails . The committee plans to raise money for the park through private and corporate donations and through land trust organizations such as the Southern Land Preservation Trust , an organization that has helped preserve land with natural significance . <p> There are several ways in which you can help . <p> Contact each member of the Board of Education immediately and tell them you support this effort . Current and future board members and administrators include : Bob Rogers , Nora Monahan , Tim Moxley , Carol Benton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike Christopher , Gary Puckett and Fred Larsen .
