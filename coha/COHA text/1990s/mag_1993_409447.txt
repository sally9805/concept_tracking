The helicopter is well on its way to becoming the pack mule of the next century . Aboard these craft you can explore some of the best fishing on earth  --  and literally escape to nowhere . As the helicopter crowded the steep mountain face I felt a peculiar twinge of exhilaration and terror . Clenching my seat and tightening down the safety belt , I managed to keep from slamming against the bubble-glass door as we tail-slid at about 8,000 feet , struggling against gusting mountain winds in the 206B JetRanger . It was white-knuckle time . The pilot , Derrick Robinson of Canadian Helicopters , flashed a wry smile as he righted the chopper , acknowledging my fright as a first-time helicopter passenger . With the same glance he reassured me that hugging this huge mass of glacier-carved rock was part of his flight plan . " The wind up here is just like water , " came the electronic crackle of his voice through my headset . " It 's like a running river , you just have to know where the currents are and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cruising smoothly , riding the wind currents like a yacht at full sail . Robinson negotiated the craft through a series of mountain passes above  --  and below  --  a majestic piece of earth in the Canadian Rockies , just outside the border of Banff National Park in Canmore , Alberta . Our destination was a little-fished meltwater impoundment known as Stanton Lake . Before we left the ground , my fishing guide Anders Rousse had explained that to reach Stanton by conventional travel , which in the mountains meant foot or horse pack , it would take two or three days . Our flight to the pristine lake aboard the JetRanger lasted about 20 minutes . And although the wind made for a heart-pounding , grab-onto-your-seat , **29;0;TOOLONG kind of ride , it sure beat hiking . And it was all part of the show . For an increasing number of anglers , helicopters are the only way to travel . Already whirlybirds are used across North America and in many foreign destinations for a variety of outdoor activities . Heli-skiing , heli-hiking and heli-sightseeing are a few popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . But heli-fishing is one of the newest and fastest growing of the helicopter adventures . It 's easy to see why . " Helicopters can get you farther and farther into the bush , and they can land you in areas in easier than fixed-wing aircraft , " said Robinson . " Basically , anywhere a truck or airplane stops , helicopters take over . " Remote areas accessed by helicopters are usually devoid of regular fishing pressure , and in some areas the fish have never felt the sting of a hook or encountered an artificial lure . Simply put , fishing in these out-of-reach areas can be outstanding . And in a time when many lakes and streams are overfished or otherwise heavily pressured , such escape is coveted by solitary-minded anglers . According to Mike Fitzgerald Jr. , co-owner of Frontiers International travel service , which specializes in fishing trip packages , there are several benefits to heli-fishing . " The helicopter concept is great , " he said . " Depending on the area , heli-fishing allows you to reach your destination in less time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish are . Even if the fishing is n't better , heli-fishing provides a wonderful wilderness experience , with spectacular vistas . " To date , Frontiers books heli-fishing trips to Alaska , New Zealand and Russia . Each adventure promises excellent fishing in remarkably unspoiled wilderness areas . For the Russian excursion , on the Kola Peninsula above St. Petersburg , helicopters are the only means of transportation  --  if it was n't for whirlybirds , there would be no fishing at all . Craig Murray , owner of Nimmo Bay Resort in British Columbia , said that heli-fishing is the only way to fly  --  and to flyfish . All of Murray 's trips are via helicopter . " Helicopters transcend all fishing boundaries , " he said . " And heli-fishing takes all the worry out of angling . If the fish are n't in one area , you can fly over a mountain range and you 're on a whole new river system . " With helicopter access to both mainland British Columbia and Vancouver Island , Murray treats his guests to some of the best steelhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through early June , winter-run steelhead offer spectacular angling . The fish are hard-fighting , brightly hued trophies that weigh from 10 to 30 pounds . " There is no general access to these areas so they have never been fished before . It 's the last frontier , " Murray said . FISHING WITH SOUL But fishing in seclusion offers more than huge , wild fish , believe it or not . While heli-anglers probe the rivers and soak in the pristine back country , the overall outdoor experience seems to fill their souls . " Fishing almost becomes secondary , " Murray said . " You just settle into a marvelous state of relaxation . We can land on glaciers , on mountaintops , in areas with old-growth trees . The opportunity you have is to catch wonderful fish in a pristine setting . It 's indescribable . " With 20 rivers to choose from in the region where Murray guides , Nimmo Bay Resort clients are often carted to nowhere  --  literally . Some destinations offer no reasonable access and are largely unexplored . " People ask me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jokes . " ' Who cares ! " I say . " Because of the unique aspect of helicopter travel , heli-fishing opens new opportunities , especially for people who can not hike  --  or do n't want to . Take Harlan Bird , a 92-year-old fisherman from Tucson , Arizona , who took advantage of Nimmo Bay 's guiding service to do what he loves best  --  trout fish in the mountains . Via helicopter , he was whisked directly to the stream bank , thus eliminating any backcountry hiking . Bird was then able to fish and wade streams and experience the same fishing freedoms he treasured in his younger days . And when Bird tired of wading , he simply set up a folding chair , sat down and continued casting . " With helicopters , nobody 's retired from fishing , " Murray continued . On Vancouver Island , just west of the Nimmo Bay operation , Canadian Helicopters has a flight base that offers heli-fishing packages on a daytrip basis . Pilot and base manager Kevin O'Neill is a licensed fishing guide and organizes heli-fishing excursions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivers . With five fishing lodges located near the helicopter base in the Campbell River area , guests can book a trip with O'Neill for one day and fish several excellent river systems . FLEXIBLE FLYERS The flexibility of helicopters also is a plus for anglers who have invested time and money into an angling getaway . In all his years of guiding with helicopters , Murray has never had a down day due to weather or mechanical problems during his April to October season . And if heavy rains cause the rivers to swell , helicopters open the door to a variety of other outdoor activities , such as sightseeing or wildlife observation , or jaunts to rivers where the fishing conditions are better . In addition to heli-fishing , for example , Murray 's outfit offers " Heli-ventures : " sightseeing cruises along the Pacific coast , and " Flying Colors : " trips to picturesque settings for photographers or painters . " There 's really nothing we ca n't do , " Murray said . Mike Fitzgerald pointed out , however , that heli-fishing might not be within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To heli-fish , you must be ready to pay the price , which is sometimes up to double the cost of a week 's fishing at a fixed lodge ( access by drift-boat or vehicle only ) in Alaska or New Zealand . The added cost is largely due to the fact that helicopters are more expensive to own , operate and maintain than fixed-wing craft or ground and water transportation . The average cost for a one-day heli-fishing trip with Canadian Helicopters ranges from $600 to $800 , American . But as the saying goes , you get what you pay for  --  helicopters will get you where you 're going faster , in an exciting and often once-in-a-lifetime fashion . Plus you 're likely to catch more and bigger fish in the remote areas where you touch down . " I think we 'll see more heli-fishing , " Fitzgerald said . " I know of some Western outfitters in the United States hoping to get into it . The problem is bringing it to the market at a cost that clients can afford . " To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranges , cruising over the top of a herd of grazing caribou , or just following the switchbacks of a meandering river . FLIGHT PLANNING So from New Zealand to Alaska , to British Columbia or the Rocky Mountains , what 's the best way to organize a heli-fishing trip ? Many travel services offer heli-fishing packages , and more and more lodges are offering chopper-aided fishing trips . However , because heli-fishing entails access into wild , remote areas , it 's not advisable to hire an independent pilot and charter your own alpine trip , much like you might with a fixed-wing bush pilot . Instead , it 's best to consult a travel service for information on lodges offering heli-fishing . For information on helicopter operators , write Helicopter Association International , 1619 Duke St. , Alexandria , VA 22314 . ( See the list for lodges and travel consultants offering heli-fishing trips . ) Although heli-fishing can be pricey , the benefits are many and the experience is one you 'll likely never forget . As Craig Murray likes to say , " To fly is human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELI-FISHING Arguably , heli-fishing got its start in the outer reaches of British Columbia in a sheltered coastal area called Nimmo Bay . There Craig Murray , owner of Nimmo Bay Resort , had a brainstorm in 1983 while making repairs to a hydro-electric generator that supplied power to the resort . Murray had flown to the generator in a helicopter , and after the repairs were complete , he persuaded the chopper pilot to land on a stream bank . He enjoyed one of his best steelheading days ever , and , he says , a new concept in angling was born . Today Nimmo Bay offers only heli-fishing packages , and according to Murray , the British Columbia wilderness is the perfect place for it . " Nowhere else in the world is more perfect for this type of operation , " he says . " All the fish come home to roost . " In the 40,000-square-mile area that Murray has the access rights to , anglers will find steelhead and trout in the spring , rainbow and cutthroat trout in the summer , and five strains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay Resort leases and operates three A Star helicopters from Canadian Helicopters , the world 's second largest commercial helicopter company . The pilots are licensed fishing guides , and they are required to complete intensive mountain training courses each year . Murray said that such safety measures are essential , and he pointed out that before embarking on any heli-fishing excursion , anglers should inquire into the company 's safety record , pilot qualifications and helicopter maintenance procedures . <p>
