Section : RETIREMENT With these strategies , you will never run out of money . <p> You 've scrimped , saved and schemed for decades , and now retirement is less than five years away . If you are like most of the 6% of American workers on the brink of retiring , you probably think there are just a few final adjustments to make . Among them : switching most of your money into secure income investments so that you can live off the interest for the rest of your life . Nothing could be simpler or safer , right ? <p> Wrong . That strategy may have worked for your grandparents , but it will cut your income by a third in just 10 years . The villain , of course , is inflation . The moment you retire , you lose your stoutest protection against price hikes  --  regular salary increases that have probably exceeded inflation by one or two percentage points annually over the past 40 years . If you invest your money in retirement solely for income , you could become a candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financially dependent on your children . <p> Most people approaching retirement-or already there  --  are well aware that inflation is a threat . According to a recent poll by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation in Washington , D.C. , 70% of retirees worry that price rises will reduce their standard of living . Their fears stem mainly from an error that they made in their final working years  --  and one you can easily avoid . The mistake : they underestimated how long they were likely to live in retirement . <p> Today , people age 62 should count on living for another 25 years or more . Moreover , the longer you live , the longer you are likely to live . That is , as you grow older , the odds improve of your beating the U.S. average life expectancy ( 71.4 years for men and 78.3 for women ) . When a man hits 75 , for instance , he has a fifty-fifty chance of making it to 84 ; a woman of that age can expect to reach 86 . As welcome as that news might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation steady at today 's 5% , an in come of $50,000 will be worth less than $15,000 in 25 years . <p> Thus as you approach your last days at your job , check the inflation resistance of your major sources of retirement income and take steps to compensate for those that are found wanting . Consider the following : <p> Social Security . However inadequate your benefits may seem to you , they will rise in step with living costs . <p> Pensions . Ask your benefits department whether your pension will be adjusted periodically for inflation . You may be among the lucky 24% of workers who can expect such adjustments . But more likely , the value of your benefits will decline steadily . <p> Part-time work . Until age 65 , you can earn $7,080 a year ( the amount rises annually with inflation ) without losing any Social Security benefits ; above that , benefits are reduced by 50&gt; for each dollar earned . For retirees age 65 through 69 , the limit is $9,720 , and the penalty on earnings above that is 33&gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty applies . <p> Home equity . With housing prices likely to outpace annual inflation by a modest one percentage point or so over the next decade or two , you might be wise to trade down to a cheaper home to reduce monthly costs and free up equity for investing . <p> Investments . Because they can outpace inflation by three to five percentage points a year , growth-oriented investments such as the ones discussed below and in the story starting on page 84 constitute your most important resource in retirement . <p> That three- to five-point real return can make an enormous difference in your future financial security , especially if you can draw on another source of income in your early retirement years and let your investments grow . Take the case of a retired couple , both age 62 , who need $50,000 in today 's dollars to live comfortably and who already have an annual income of $36,000 , including $14,000 from Social Security and $22,000 from a pension that does not rise with inflation . If they invest solely in the most conservative income investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so , they will need a retirement fund of $600,000 . But they can reduce that amount to about $420,000 if one of them earns $7,000 annually from part-time work in the first five years of retirement , and their investment portfolio beats inflation by three points a year . <p> Ideally , you should begin making final plans three to five years before you actually retire . But you can finetune your plan in your first months of leisure . Take , for example , the Atlantans pictured on page 106 , Jim Dryden , 55 , and his wife Pat , 54 . In March , he left his job as an information processor for Southern Company Services , a utility holding company . For nearly 30 years , he had stashed 10% to 20% of his salary in savings that included a tax-deferred plan at work . As a result , the Drydens ' portfolio of stocks , bonds and cash investments now tops $400,000 . <p> They expect that if they reinvest part of their annual return from those assets to keep their principal growing faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly $24,000 a year in today 's dollars for the rest of their lives . The couple think that amount will be enough to supplement Jim 's annual pension of $19,000 , which is not indexed to inflation , and their estimated $19,000 income from Social Security , which will start when they turn 62 and be adjusted annually for rising prices  --  but they 're not sure . So while they play tennis and travel in the Southeast for a relaxing year , Jim will tabulate every expense on his personal computer . " Then we 'll decide if we need to make adjustments in our expenses or look for part-time work , " he says . <p> On the eve of retiring , you ca n't afford to suffer big losses on your investments , because it 's too late to make up for them with fresh savings . One danger you might overlook : too much money in your own company 's stock . If you have an employee stock ownership plan ( ESOP ) , such holdings can grow to 20% of your total assets  --  well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should keep in the shares of any one company . Fortunately , your employer must allow you to move money into other investments before you retire . ( Typically , you can shift 25% after age 55 and 50% after age 60 . ) <p> As the charts above show , the best mix of assets changes as you get older , though some of your money should always be invested for growth . You should cut back the proportion of your portfolio in stocks as you age because you will have less time to recover from severe bear market losses . Nonetheless , because inflation always remains a threat , you should keep 40% or so of your money in conservative stocks with prospects for earnings growth of 5% a year or more even 10 years after you retire . ( For specific advice on how much money you can afford to withdraw from your portfolio each year without ever running the risk of outliving your money , see the box on pages 108 and 109 . ) <p> The following two portfolio allocations , recommended by experts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income and growth . The first is designed for your initial 10 to 15 years of retirement , the second for late retirement . Suitable choices for both portfolios include some investments recommended for pre-retirees in the story on page 100 , as well as others that are described below . <p> EARLY IN RETIREMENT <p> Blue chips and large growth stocks : 30% <p> Total-return stocks : 20% <p> High-quality bonds : 25% <p> Cash : 25% <p> Total-return target : 9% to 10% a year <p> As retirement approaches , you can lower the risk in your portfolio by adopting the mix of investments shown above . Start by reducing equities to half your portfolio , and replace some blue-chip and large growth stocks with more conservative total-return stocks  --  shares of companies that offer dividend yields above that of the S &P; 500 , recently 3.5% . <p> Geraldine Weiss , editor of the newsletter Investment Quality Trends in La Jolla , Calif. , recommends companies that have raised their dividends at an annual rate of 10% for the past 10 years , pay yields of nearly 4% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over a decade , such shares can deliver average total returns of as much as 14% a year . Among her top picks : A.T . Cross ( 1991 revenues , $235 million ) , which makes high-priced pens and pencils as well as leather goods and gift items . The stock recently traded on the American Stock Exchange for $25 a share , with a 5.1% yield and a P/E of 14 . Weiss also favors $425 million John H. Harlaud ( recently traded on the New York Stock Exchange at $22.75 a share ) , which prints checks , financial forms and related products ; with a P/E of 14 , it recently yielded 3.8% . <p> Investors who prefer mutual funds might consider no-loads that hold such stocks . Donald Phillips , editor of Mutual Fund Values , recommends these two : Scudder Growth &; Income ( three-year total return of 44.6% ; $1,000 minimum investment ; 800225-2470 ) and T. Rowe Price Equity Income ( three-year total return , 36.6% ; $2,500 minimum ; 800-638-5660 ) . <p> Fixed-income investments ought to account for 25% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the greatest safety , stick with Treasury issues , which are now yielding 7.2% to 8.3% . With $25,000 , you can buy five Treasuries that will mature at regular intervals over the next decade or so-a technique known as laddering . Then , if interest rates rise , you can reinvest the proceeds of the issues that mature soonest ; if rates fall , you can sell the bonds with the longest maturities at a profit . <p> As an alternative , you might assemble a laddered portfolio of tax . exempt municipals . They currently yield 5.7% to 7.2% , equivalent to a taxable yield of 8% or better if you are in the 28% federal bracket or higher ( taxable income above $34,000 for a couple filing jointly , $20,350 for singles ) . Mark Donohue , a senior vice president with bond dealer Gabriele Hueglin &; Cashman in New York City , advises investors to buy only high-quality general-obligation municipals rated double or triple A by agencies such as Standard &; Poor 's . Among his top picks : Pennsylvania 6.5s of 2006 , recently trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6.35s of 2002 , recently trading at 100 and yielding 6.35% . If you prefer the convenience of mutual funds , choose those that invest at least 90% of their assets in bonds rated A or better and that have expense ratios below 0.7% . Phillips recommends Vanguard **27;202;TOOLONG Portfolio ( recent yield , 6.5% ; $3,000 minimum ; 800-662-7447 ) . <p> Finally , keep 25% of your portfolio in cash investments to smooth out your returns . You might , for example , put $10,000 or so in a government money-market fund for emergencies and invest the rest in a short-term bond fund . Such funds buy mostly government or corporate issues with maturities of one to five years , so their share prices may fluctuate by 3% or 4% a year . But with recent yields of about 7% to 9% , these funds offer a low-risk way to boost your income . Phillips suggests Scudder Short . Term Bond ( recent yield , 9.1% ; $1,000 minimum ; 800-225-2470 ) . <p> LATE IN RETIREMENT <p> Total return stocks : 20% <p> High yield stocks : 20% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Total-return target : 8% a year <p> As you reach your seventies , inflation is less of a concern , but your vulnerability to unexpected losses is much greater . You should therefore adopt the portfolio shown above , which carries only about a third of the risk of the overall stock market . It calls for boosting your holdings of bonds and cash to 25% and 35% of your portfolio , respectively . Do n't take any chances with either . With bonds , buy Treasuries that mature in five to seven years ; keep your cash in a government money fund . <p> Since you can expect to live for at least another decade , leave 40% of your money in stocks . Hang on to the total-return stocks you bought early in retirement for their combination of dividend income and growth . But reduce your overall portfolio risk by shifting from blue chips and other large-company growth shares to high . yield stocks , which typically pay 7% or more a year and can boost their dividends at least as fast as inflation . <p> Chuck Carlson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ind. , recommends financially strong utilities that have raised their dividends for at least 15 consecutive years . His picks include electric utility Northern States Power ( NYSE , $34.25 , 6.8% yield ) and electric and gas utility Orange &; Rockland Utilities ( NYSE , $33 , 7.1% yield ) . Among funds , Don Phillips recommends no-load Fidelity Utilities Income ( 5.5% yield ; $2,500 minimum ; 800-544-8888 ) . <p> By age 75 or so , you can probably begin dipping into your capital  --  at least sparingly  --  without fear your money will run out before you do . And you may find that you will still have a sizable estate to leave behind . But do n't be in any hurry to make big gifts to relatives or charities while you are alive . After all , you might be whacking golf balls and quaffing vintage wines for another decade or two . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : New retirees Jim Dryden , 55 , and his wife Pat , 54 , will play tennis and travel this year on their $43,000 annual income  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIS <p> HOW TO MAKE SURE YOUR SAVINGS LAST <p> When the time comes to tap a retirement fund , most people want to withdraw a predictable amount every year without eroding the value of their principal . This is actually a lot more difficult than it sounds . First , if you keep your money in anything other than short-term income investments , such as bank CDs , your returns will vary unpredictably from year to year . Second , your true objective should be to preserve your portfolio 's purchasing power , not its nominal value in dollars . That means you will have to add to your principal periodically to keep it even with inflation . <p> Here are the most popular ways to determine how much to spend each year : <p> Never touch principal . The strategy of spending only dividends and interest made perfect sense 50 years ago when consumer prices were relatively stable . Since the 1960s , though , inflation has chugged along at an annual average rate of 5%  --  fast enough to halve the purchasing power of your principal every 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to maximize their income , which often causes them to concentrate on bonds and to underemphasize growth-oriented stocks . Assume , for example , that you want to spend about 7% of your portfolio each year . To earn that average yield with long-term Treasury bonds paying 8.2% and bluechip stocks yielding 3.5% , you would have to put nearly three-quarters of your money in bonds . The trouble is , bonds offer no growth and therefore no protection against the erosion of your purchasing power , so the 25% of your money in stocks would have to grow at an unlikely 20% year after year to keep your overall holdings even with 5% inflation . <p> By contrast , you could put two-thirds of your money in blue-chip stocks , which would have to grow by only 7.5% for your portfolio to match 5% inflation . The average yield , however , would be just a bit above 5%  --  hardly a generous income . <p> Make sure your principal is inflation-proof . Each year , figure your total return-capital gains plus dividends and interest . Then invest enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation on your principal and spend the rest . ( Remember , though , that you will have to pay taxes on the dividends , interest and realized capital gains that you reinvest as well as on the money you spend . ) <p> While this strategy absolutely protects your portfolio 's purchasing power , your income wo n't be stable . Imagine , for instance , that you split a $100,000 portfolio evenly between bonds yielding 8.2% and stocks paying 3.5% . If your stocks jump 20% in value one year , the portfolio 's total return will be 15.8% . With 5% inflation , you can withdraw 10.8%  --  or $10,800  --  to spend that year , leaving $105,000 ( $100,000 adjusted for inflation ) . <p> Now assume that in the second year your stocks decline by 11.7% . The total return on your overall portfolio would be zero , giving you no spendable income . Further , you would have to make up for the $5,250 inflation adjustment ( 5% of $105,000 ) you missed that year by investing an extra $5,512.50 ( $5,250 adjusted for inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could reduce the wild income swings by basing your withdrawals on several years ' results . You could , for instance , take out the difference between the portfolio 's average return and the average rate of inflation over the past five years . This would give you a steadier stream of income , but it would n't solve the entire problem . Even over five-year periods , bluechip-stock returns fluctuate a lot ; average annual returns over five-year periods have ranged from - 2% to 24% during the past 50 years . <p> Spend a set percentage . This year-in , year-out approach may be the best overall solution , since it reflects both long-term inflation rates and investment returns . Over the long haul-25 years or so  --  bond yields historically beat inflation by two to three percentage points . With 5% inflation , the average return on bonds is likely to be 7% to 8% during the 1990s . Growth-oriented stocks typically return six points or so above inflation , for a projected average return of 11% or more during the next 10 years . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can expect an average long-term return of around 9.5% . But if you choose your stocks wisely , following the advice in the accompanying story , you could probably achieve a long-term annual return of as much as 12% . You could then withdraw 7% of your portfolio each year and over time still keep your principal 's purchasing power even with 5% inflation . <p> In following this strategy , you can invest your money in the mix of stocks and bonds that best fits your appetite for risk . But you will have to adjust your withdrawal rate accordingly . For example , if you are conservative and favor bonds , keep it to 5% or so ; if you are willing to be more aggressive , you can go as high as 7% . <p> Even this strategy will not guarantee absolutely steady income from year to year . Your spending could vary by 10% or so as your portfolio 's value changes . To smooth out those fluctuations , you could spend less than your set percentage in years when your stock gains are greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are below 8% . Best of all , you can choose the investments that promise the most attractive long-term returns and still be confident that the purchasing power of your principal will be fairly well protected . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The Markese credo : " Staying even with inflation is the key . " <p> By John Markese <p> <p> John Markese is research director of the American Association of Individual Investors in Chicago . <p> STAYING AHEAD OF RISING PRICES <p> Since you should figure on living 20 years or more after you stop working , you must fully protect your portfolio against the effects of inflation during the first 10 years or so of retirement . This requires a portfolio like the one shown in the top chart . Keep at least half of your money in growth and total-return stocks ( or in mutual funds that hold such issues ) . Over time , rising corporate profits will enable stocks to provide capital gains and higher dividends that will offset inflation . <p> After you turn 75 , portfolio growth is less important , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less , as shown in the lower chart . The reason : your reduced life expectancy makes inflation less of a threat . By boostings the amount you keep in cash and bonds or bond mutual funds and putting half your remaining stock investments into high-yield issues or income-oriented funds , you can raise your yield to as much as 7% , while still keeping sufficient inflation protection to maintain your standard of living for the rest of your life .
