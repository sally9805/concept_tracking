Assault on the First Amendment It never quite added up : the tendency of modern liberalisn to favor strict regulation of property rights , and absolute freedom of speech . Now the mask is off , and free speech is out . <p> J.DONALD SILVA is a Congregational pastor in New Castle , New Hampshire . He had also been a writing instructor at the University of New Hampshire for thirty years , until April 1993 , when UNH suspended him , charging that he had created an " intimidating , hostile , and offensive academic environment . " The evidence consisted of two offbeat remarks Silva had made in class  --  one comparing " focus " in the writing process to sex , the other illustrating the meaning of " simile " with a famed belly dancer 's comparison of her profession to " Jell-o on a plate with a vibrator under the plate . " After seven female students complained , UNH administrators suspended Silva without pay and told him to undergo psychological counseling before petitioning for reinstatement . <p> When Silva , unable to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNH hired one of New Hampshire 's top law firms to mount a scorched-earth defense . ( A year and a half later , Silva has been provisionally reinstated under court order . ) Commenting on the case , NOW and academics of a similar stripe have maintained that there can be no justice for women unless we deal resolutely with characters like Don Silva . Barbara White , a women 's studies professor at UNH , explained that " the First Amendment and Academic Freedom ( I 'll call them FAF sic ) have traditionally protected the rights of white heterosexual men . " For others , " FAF . . . is just a yoke around our necks . " <p> This unapologetic defense illustrates a sad truth : liberalism no longer stands unequivocally for free speech . Radical feminists like Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin were the first to argue that women 's equality required the suppression of pornography and of " verbal conduct " that might give offense . Women 's groups have waged an aggressive legal campaign to suppress pro-life protests  --  including peaceful sit-ins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also latched onto the anti-free-speech agenda . Civil-rights organizations have lobbied successfully to expand civil-rights laws so as to prohibit not only discriminatory conduct but also offensive speech . " Hate speech " laws , stiffer penalties for crimes motivated by racial or ethnic animosity , and campus speech codes are among the best-known examples . And recently it came to public attention that federal housing bureaucrats , egged on by advocates for " the homeless , " were investigating private citizens for speaking out against the placement of shelters and similar facilities for the " handicapped " in their neighborhoods . Thinning the Ranks <p> SOME ON the Left have so far resisted the urge to suppress speech that certain groups find offensive . Traditional civil libertarians  --  perhaps best exemplified by columnist Nat Hentoff and ACLU President Nadine Strossen  --  have maintained an uncompromising stand on the First Amendment , even as many of their political allies have turned against it . But the civil-libertarian ranks have grown alarmingly thin , and they are confronted with an army of partisan agitators  --  on everything from racial justice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitious . It is not a foregone conclusion that the civil libertarians will lose this battle . But it is not at all unlikely , and there would be a certain logic to it . <p> Liberalism ( in the contemporary sense ) has never had a fundamental problem with coercion . Since the 1930s , it has championed state power over " mere economic rights " to facilitate the collective pursuit of equality . " Personal " rights were held to be different ; privacy ( that is , abortion and non-marital sex ) and free speech , liberalism held , must enjoy broad constitutional protection . Unlike property rights , these liberties did not seem to threaten the pursuit of equality . But this dichotomy was never totally secure . In many settings , speech is as much an instrument of power as money is . It may therefore raise the same egalitarian concerns that , from a liberal 's perspective , require expansive regulation of business . And in fact , New Deal liberals advocated government regulation of speech in areas such as broadcasting , advertising , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech was always more selective and instrumental than its absolutist rhetoric implied . Its tendency was to turn the First Amendment into a citadel for academics , advocates , and progressive social constituencies . As long as they could speak in a robust and wide-open debate , reason would triumph over prejudice , enlightened public opinion over entrenched political and economic power . <p> This confidence in the harmony of civil-libertarian values and egalitarian aspirations is a thing of the past . Progressive opinion has come to doubt that free speech and debate will cure an irredeemably racist , reactionary society ; and once this doubt seeps in , it is not so easy to explain why the pursuit of equality should stop at the water 's edge of speech . University professors , including many legal scholars , now stress that speech can be an instrument of oppression as well as of liberation ; that it may cement existing " power structures " ; and that powerless minorities should receive special protection from offensive speech . This view of the First Amendment is no longer marginal within the academy ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free Speech by Cass Sunstein , a widely respected legal scholar ) , and it has begun to make its mark on the law . <p> During the civil-rights era , the Supreme Court 's jurisprudence reflected a faith in the congruence between social equality and free speech . The Supreme Court defined " speech " very broadly , so as to include preferred forms of leftist activism such as demonstrations , pickets , boycotts , and litigation . At the same time , it insisted that the state must not regulate speech on the basis of its content , for only government neutrality would protect social reformers from officials bent on preserving the old order . But more recent decisions undermine the traditional approach to free speech , especially the neutrality principle . The Court has opened the door to egalitarian inroads on the First Amendment . <p> In a 1993 case , Wisconsin v. Mitchell , the Justices examined a hate-crime law that significantly increased criminal penalties if the defendant " intentionally selected the victim because of the race , religion , color , disability , sexual orientation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Court unanimously upheld the statute on the grounds that it was directed not at expression but only at " conduct unprotected by the First Amendment . " <p> It is not at all clear , however , that this is so . The Wisconsin statute subjects defendants to increased penalties solely on the basis of their motives and beliefs . In this critical respect , it raises First Amendment concerns that would ordinarily give the Justices pause . Even in the extremely cursory Mitchell opinion , the Court acknowledged these concerns . But it responded that a discriminatory motive " plays the same role under the Wisconsin statute as it does under federal and state discrimination laws " ; and these , the Court said , had always been upheld against constitutional challenge . <p> The Wisconsin statute indeed follows the pattern of many civil-rights laws , in that it punishes the " arbitrary selection " of crime victims . The comparison , though , is preposterous . The employer who refrains from " arbitrarily selecting " employees on account of their race is praised as an equal-opportunity employer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who kill and maim indiscriminately ? This obvious absurdity , if nothing else , shows that the statute was not a content-neutral regulation of conduct . In contrast to employment laws that prohibit discriminatory conduct irrespective of the employer 's motives , it is aimed squarely at motives and beliefs . By likening hate crime to employment discrimination , and hate-crime laws to civil-rights laws , the Court suggested that just about any speech regulation is constitutional if it is written as , and officially declared to be , a " civil rights " law . <p> Civil-rights regulators , especially in higher education , drew precisely this conclusion . In trade publications such as The Chronicle of Higher Education , university lawyers cheerfully explained that campus speech codes ( most of which had been scuttled by an earlier Supreme Court decision , RAV v. St. Paul ) could be reinstituted if they were rewritten as regulations of " verbal conduct " and prefaced with some general anti-discrimination incantation . Federal agencies reacted with equal swiftness . In July 1993 , the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission proposed new rules that defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " verbal conduct " ) that " denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his/her race , color , religion , gender , national origin , age , or disability , or that of his/her relatives , friends , or associates . " Epithets , slurs , and " negative stereotyping , " along with all " written or graphic material " that displays " hostility or aversion , " would provide disgruntled employees with a federal cause of action . <p> Guidelines published by the Education Department 's Office for Civil Rights ( OCR ) this March go even further in defining " harassment . " They seem to subject anything a professor or student might write or say to official oversight . When legal commentator Stuart Taylor asked a high-ranking OCR lawyer whether a law professor 's classroom discussion of a controversial subject such as affirmative action might violate the guidelines , the lawyer in effect admitted it could . <p> One would hope that the Supreme Court would not tolerate the enforcement of these regulations in a context such as Stuart Taylor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can no longer be entirely sure . This June , in Madsen v. Women 's Health Center , the Justices upheld a trial court 's injunction that , among other things , barred anti-abortion protestors from entrances to abortion clinics . The bar applied not only to identified individuals who had arguably violated an earlier , similar injunction but also to all individuals acting " in concert " with them . Yet demonstrations in favor of abortion were still permitted . Amazingly , the Court held that the injunction was nonetheless content neutral . <p> If there is some solace , it is that the Supreme Court has endorsed egalitarian restraints on heretofore protected speech with grudging pragmatism rather than enthusiasm . Madsen invalidated portions of the trial court 's sweeping injunction , and Mitchell at least paid lip service to the principle that government must not regulate speech directly on the basis of its content . The opinions  --  both written , in an ostentatiously statesmanlike tone , by Chief Justice Rehnquist  --  do not embrace the egalitarian agenda ; rather , they read like tactical concessions to shrill constituencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ False Hope <p> IT MIGHT BE tempting to think , then , that the damage has been limited . One might even be inclined to welcome the demise of First Amendment absolutism and liberalism 's newfound concern with the harmful effects of certain forms of speech . We need not be so alarmed by decisions that , in the end , restrict speech only at the margin , or weep over the racist diatribes that may be lost in the wake of Mitchell . And the pro-life movement will survive Madsen . <p> But dismissing this as judicial pragmatism and tactical games fails to recognize that the egalitarian agenda is the most serious and thoroughgoing assault on free speech in decades . McCarthyism , which arose with the Communist threat , disappeared long before it . The egalitarians will not be tamed so easily . And unlike the Religious Right  --  which , far from being able to censor anybody , has to suffer the expulsion of its speech from many a public forum where it might make a difference  --  the egalitarian censors occupy the command posts of government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well positioned to suppress speech . <p> The egalitarian enthusiasm for regulating speech is particularly pernicious because it strikes at the heart of free speech without tempering the excesses of First Amendment absolutism . Conservative scholars such as Walter Berns and Robert Bork always wanted to protect rational discourse ; they simply doubted that the same protection should be extended to " expression " such as nude dancing or Nazi marches . This perspective has struck libertarians as unduly narrow . But it does have the virtue of extending the most categorical constitutional protection to speech that is eminently worthy of protection and unquestionably at the core of the First Amendment . Egalitarianism , in contrast , would protect speech not according to its intrinsic value or its value to democratic government but according to its contribution to the quest for equality . The same ACLU that supported the state of Wisconsin in Mitchell and shamefully sat out Madsen still defends panhandling as free speech and insists that a bum with a very bad bod y odor and a habit of accosting female patrons must be given free access to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court , the ACLU has made tactical concessions to the egalitarian agenda , while still trying to maintain its historic commitment to free speech . For example , it has supported hate-crime laws but opposes codes that would regulate speech directly . But such nice distinctions miss the point of the egalitarian agenda , which is to prohibit hateful speech not because it is worthless or not really speech at all but because it offends the sensibilities of women , racial minorities , and other preferred constituencies . This logic does not stop at regulating " hate " speech , however broadly defined . Since a scholar 's argument can be far more painful than a drunkard 's epithet , government on this reasoning could and perhaps should ban Charles Murray 's or Thomas Sowell 's books from college campuses . <p> At the same time , others must endure and , indeed , embrace the " speech " of oppressed minorities , no matter how raucous . The members of ACT-UP demand their right to flaunt their lifestyle on the steps of St. Patrick 's Cathedral . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be summarily suspended and declared a mental case . In short , the animating principle of egalitarianism is not moderation or civility ; it is thought control and coerced sensitivity toward professional victims . <p> This agenda may still look like a fringe concern , and it may still seem unlikely that mainstream liberalism will jettison its long-standing commitment to free speech . But this would not be the first time liberalism has sacrificed high principle for expediency . In the late 1960s , the civil-rights movement discarded the ideal of color blindness like so much useless baggage and turned to quotas . The liberals who held onto the ideal found a home in the pages of Commentary but lost any connection to a real political constituency . The civil libertarians who still defend free speech as a matter of principle may soon find themselves in the same position . Much as quotas became part of the fabric of American politics , the suppression of speech may soon become an integral part of the welfare state 's agenda . <p> The egalitarian assault on free speech can still be arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were when they managed to ram quotas down our throats . Liberalism has lost public support even in its original domain of economic regulation . Voters have just about had it with a government that treats their property as a collective resource to be doled out to favored constituents . They are n't quite ready to dismantle the bureaucratic state , and they are still reluctant to oppose anything that sails under the banner of equality and civil rights . But they can be persuaded that liberalism should not be permitted to renege on its promise to exempt speech from its meddling . They can be persuaded , that is , that a government which mucks around in every other corner of the marketplace must at least steer clear of the marketplace of ideas . Rallying the fairness and good sense of the voters in the fight against the leftist censors will be a big task . But it would be a grave mistake to wait for th e Supreme Court to carry the main burden of that fight . <p> By MICHAEL GREVE <p> <p> Mr. Greve is executive director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm , which represents Don SIlva . <p>
