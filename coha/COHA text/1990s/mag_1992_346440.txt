IT HAD BEEN BILLED AS THE GRAND BATTLE OF THE Yitzhaks : a robust election campaign pitting Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir against the toughest foe he has faced  --  the former and newly returned head of the Labor Party , Yitzhak Rabin . Instead , the fight has shriveled into what the Jerusalem Post last week called " the Longest Yawn . " Voters are so overcome with ennui that the major parties are canceling campaign events for lack of attendance . Posters and banners can hardly be seen in the streets . And Shamir 's Likud is moaning that the Venezuelan soap opera Crystal is drawing the party 's natural constituency away from the nightly dose of televised party propaganda . <P> The principal source of the rampant indifference is that nobody expects the June 23 voting to really change anything . For some time , the opposition Labor Party has been running well ahead of Shamir 's Likud in the polls ; the latest surveys give the parties , respectively , 42 and 33 places in the 120-seat Knesset . But because neither organization has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inevitable , as has always been the case in Israeli elections . And when the big two parties are grouped with their natural alignment partners , they are running neck and neck . <P> The result may be another national-unity government , with Labor and the Likud sharing power , as they have already done twice in the past , after tight elections in 1984 and 1988 . With Labor likely to be the larger grouping , Rabin may replace Shamir as Prime Minister . But the two men 's policies are so similar that such a prospect elicits little excitement . No wonder many voters are more interested in knowing whether Victoria , the Caracas fashion mogul , will discover that her new model , Crystal , is actually the daughter she conceived with a priest-in-training and gave up for adoption long ago .
