<p> Less then three months ago , Cardinal Joseph Bernardin gallantly faced a roomful of reporters to tell the world that his pancreatic cancer had spread and would kill him within a year . <p> He faced the ordeal humbly , head-on , in the style that defined the man in life and his very public death . <p> Bernardin , 68 , the senior Roman Catholic prelate in the United States and leader of Chicago 's 2.3 million Catholics , died Thursday at his home , surrounded by friends and family . His only sister was at his side . <p> Pope John Paul II mourned the loss of a great church leader and cited the cardinal 's " dignity and hope in the face of the mystery of suffering and death .

Bernardin gave up his day-to-day duties two weeks ago . Up until then , he never avoided the most prying questions about his failing health . <p> Just days before his death , he wrote to the U.S. Supreme Court , urging it not to allow doctor-assisted suicide . In September , Bernardin also went to the cell of a death-row inmate who asked to pray with him before being executed . The cardinal said at the time : " He knows he 's going to die tonight , and I know that I am going to die in the near future .

" <p> In 1993 , Bernardin showed grace in handling the personal crisis he called " the greatest period of agony and growth in my life " - an accusation that he had molested a teen-ager . The cardinal denied he had ever had sex , and the young man later recanted and reconciled with Bernardin before dying of AIDS in 1995 . <p> Ironically , Bernardin had established a system for dealing with sexual accusations against priests that was a model for other dioceses . <p> His last major undertaking was the Catholic Common Ground Project announced earlier this year , an effort to open dialogue with Catholics who dissent from church teachings on issues such as birth control , celibacy of priests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project , but others applauded his tolerance . <p> " Cardinal Bernardin was a loving , gentle man who led by moral persuasion and personal example , never by force or fear , " said Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York , a friend who sometimes criticized Bernardin 's more liberal views . <p> " The world has lost a prince , " said Rabbi A. James Rudin of the New York-based American Jewish Committee . " Throughout his remarkable career , Cardinal Bernardin taught us how to live our lives in faith and integrity .

Archdiocesan officials declined Thursday to discuss Bernardin 's successor . <p> A funeral Mass was scheduled for Wednesday at Holy Name Cathedral . <p> Pam Sullivan , a 52-year-old parishioner who was treated for breast cancer eight years ago , praised Bernardin 's own courageous battle with the disease . <p> " I wish I had had his example then . I still look at it ( mortality ) with fear , until I think of Cardinal Bernardin , " she said . <p> Bernardin died at his home at 1:33 a.m. , Bishop Raymond Goedert said . <p> " Our brother Joseph is at peace , " Goedert said . " As Christians , we believe Cardinal Bernardin at long last begins a new life .

Just days before his death , he wrote to the U.S. Supreme Court urging against creation of a legal right to die . <p> But Bernardin spent much time in his final months discussing his illness , his struggle to overcome the fear of death , and his belief in eternal life . <p> " We can look at death in two ways , as an enemy or as a friend , " Bernardin said when he announced his illness was terminal . " As a person of faith , I see death as a friend . " <p> His openness about his impending death won praise from religious leaders .

Cook recanted the accusation and reconciled with Bernardin before dying of AIDS last year . <p> Ironically , Bernardin had established a system for dealing with sexual accusations against priests that was considered a model for other dioceses . His vindication after calmly declaring his innocence and willingness to forgive Cook mitigated damage to the church 's image from priest-abuse scandals . <p> " His transcendence of the personal clerical abuse charges will take on almost epic proportions when people review the priesthood in our times , " said Martin E. Marty , a religious historian at the University of Chicago . <p> Bernardin considered it a priest 's duty to confront sticky social issues . <p> " If we live a religious life and encourage others to do that , there is no doubt we will come into increasing conflict with the prevailing values of this society , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements sometimes enraged critics , but Bernardin rarely raised his voice in public or dropped the humble demeanor that became familiar to Catholics in the Chicago archdiocese since he took over in 1982 . <p> Bernardin was appointed after the death of Cardinal John Cody , a doctrinal conservative with a reputation for autocratic rule . Cody had been embroiled in accusations of financial wrongdoing , and Bernardin sought to repair divisions between traditionalists and progressives in the archdiocese . <p> " He gave the Chicago church a much needed renewal of spirit , " Scott Appleby , a religious scholar at the University of Notre Dame , said prior to Bernardin 's death . " He established a more open relationship with fellow priests . He had an inclusive style of leadership . " <p> Bernardin became an international figure when he guided the U.S. Catholic bishops ' 1983 pastoral letter on nuclear war .

" <p> The document furthered Bernardin 's reputation as a liberal-minded mediator and consensus-builder . <p> In 1987 he helped persuade the Vatican to restore the authority stripped from Seattle archbishop Raymond Hunthausen because of his liberal approach to some church matters . Bernardin urged the Vatican to let bishops govern their dioceses without undue interference from Rome . <p> He struck a delicate balance as chief drafter of a 1987 document in which U.S. bishops said they would tolerate educational programs that describe how condoms may prevent the spread of AIDS . Critics including Cardinal John O'Connor of New York said the document could be interpreted as condoning condom use , which the Vatican condemns along with other artificial birth control . Bernardin said the statement did n't imply church support for condom use . <p> He won a small but significant victory for women in 1992 when U.S. bishops rejected a document that would have flatly prohibited women 's ordination in favor of Bernardin 's plan for more " study and dialogue " of the issue . <p> This year , he stirred criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ground Project , an effort to open dialogue with Catholics who dissent from church teachings on issues such as birth control , celibacy of priests and ordination of women .
