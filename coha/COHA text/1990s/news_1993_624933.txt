<p> A working bluesman may travel the world . When he 's " " coasted past midnight , " he can go home again . <p> Two , in fact , do this weekend . Saxophonist Joe Houston ( Saturday ) and guitarist Johnny Copeland ( Sunday ) perform at Billy Blues nightclub and restaurant . <p> Both , touring on new albums , have Texas on the mind . Houston is an Austin native who gigged around Houston in the early ' 50s . He now lives in Long Beach , Calif. , and , he said , " " I tell everybody that the worst barbecue in Texas is better than the best here in California . I 'll be lookin ' to get some good food when I get down there . " Copeland grew up in Houston 's Third Ward , helped put the city on the map during its blues heyday of the early ' 50s , and now resides in New York City 's Harlem district . " " When I went out ( in the world ) , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " " I went out to try and build Texas blues . Texas will always be home . " <p> From Third Ward days , Copeland remembers Joe Houston as somebody " " who was blowin ' that horn . He was really good . He looked good , and he played his butt off . " Joe Houston left Austin more than 40 years ago . Today , he said , " " All the young cats tell me , ' Hey , man , I 'm going to Austin . ' I say , ' You go ahead ; I gave it up . ' " <p> He was 17 then , and Chicago was the first stop . " " There was only one black hotel in ( Austin ) , " Houston said , " " and ( the King Kolax swing band ) was booked . I was playin ' across the street . The singer from ( Kolax ) came over and he heard me . He told me , ' Hey , man , you sound good ; we need a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was finished and he 'd introduce me to the band leader . <p> " " All the fellas in my band had been on the road before , and they were telling me , ' Do n't go , man , do n't go to Chicago . <p> They gon na strand you up North . ' " Houston left with Kolax on the train at 8 the next morning . <p> " " I bet I was at the station at 6 , " he said . <p> With Kolax , Houston earned $ 10 a night . Big money . " " Man , you could get a room for 75 cents . You could buy the best shirt for $ 1.50 . I ( dressed ) sharper than the band leader . " <p> After the Kolax band broke up , Houston traveled extensively . <p> He played Corpus Christi and was in Gatemouth Moore 's band in Florida . When the latter performed at Mardi Gras in New Orleans , Houston skipped over to Houston , where his mother was living . <p> " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Texas , so I pawned my horn for $ 10 and caught me a bus to Houston . I was n't worried , because I was going home to Mama . " <p> Mama told her son , then only 18 , to go get a job . He did , as a horn man in Amos Milburn 's band . <p> " " I learned my way around Houston , " he said , " " and all the cats would let me play horn at the jam sessions . That 's where I met Amos . When I joined him , my mama took me down to the Capitol Music Store in downtown Houston , bought me a tenor , and that 's when I started playing tenor . " <p> Said Houston : " " All saxophones are the same , but the tenor takes more wind because it 's bigger . " <p> With the tenor in the early ' 50s , Houston made his mark in Big Joe Turner 's band , based at the time in Baton Rouge , La . <p> Together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped shape early rock ' n ' roll . Many have been reissued on the Specialty Records CD " " Cornbread and Cabbage Greens . " <p> Houston took up singing eight years ago and " " will have a jazz sound ( on the alto ) till the day I die . " But his honking tenor work inducted him into a distinguished order of famed Texas tenor saxmen that would include Arnett Cobb , Illinois Jacquet , Grady Gaines , David " " Fathead " Newman and Hank Crawford . <p> " " Most Texas tenor players got a lot of " " drive , " Houston said . " " Even the guitar players - I do n't care what they play , if they 're from Texas they got a lot of drive . " <p> Copeland 's time <p> Johnny Copeland remembers the thrill of getting paid to play for the first time . <p> In the early ' 50s , " " When we put our first band together , my mother had to give us consent to go in these ( nightclubs ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't do it . One night me and Joe ( Hughes ) and some others , we went down to Sugar Land . I know my mother was n't gon na let me go , so I " " slipped " off . <p> " " We got down there , and it was so good , we got paid $ 16 apiece . So when I got back home , I showed my mother that $ 16 . <p> She made about $ 10-$ 12 a week . <p> " " After that , she did n't bother me no more . " Copeland never looked back . He inherited Albert Collins ' band in 1953 , went on the road for low-paying and even nonpaying gigs , and returned to Houston as band leader at Shady 's Playhouse . <p> At the time , he was tutored by Joe " " Guitar " Hughes . The two remain good friends , and Hughes will still remind Copeland that " " ' I taught you note-for-note , ' " Copeland said . " " And you know , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legendary Texas electric guitar pioneer , T-Bone Walker . " " If I had never seen T-Bone Walker , I would never have wanted to sing the blues , " he said . <p> " " When I first saw him I 'd say , ' I do n't want to sound like him ' - but yes , I did . I did n't want to look like him - but yes , I did . I wanted to be just like him . You got to start somewhere . " From 1958 to 1975 , Copeland recorded a string of singles and forged a living on the " " chitlin ' circuit . " By the mid ' 70s , disco was threatening live music everywhere , and when the blues scene in Houston had all but dried up , Copeland relocated to New York . <p> He landed a job in Harlem , where he played four nights a week at Marcell 's . " " That 's where I started building my career , " he said . " " When I 'm in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Coast is where I have to play ; that 's where I make my money . " <p> In 1981 , Copeland was " " rediscovered " and signed with the folk-blues label Rounder , which released " " Copeland Special . " He joined a roster of African and American musicians in the fascinating " " Bringing It All Back Home " and collaborated with Albert King and Robert Cray on the " " Showdown ! " LP . <p> His new release is a debut for Verve , " " Flyin ' High . " But Copeland 's speed-of-sound career leaves little time to promote the record . <p> " " I 'm pretty happy with this , but now I 'm goin ' on to the next album , " he said . " " I just completed it . " <p> Joe Hughes plays on both records , and it 's the fulfillment of a promise made long ago . " " When me and Joe was kids , we said to each other - he said , ' If I ever go anywhere and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I said , ' OK , and if I ever go anywhere and make it I 'm gon na come and get you . ' That 's what we 've been tryin ' to do all along . " <p> It speaks to Copeland 's perspective about Texas blues . " " It scared me when I went to New York and realized nobody knew nothing about music down here but ( about ) Lightnin ' Hopkins . <p> You know , T-Bone Walker used to carry ( Dallas bluesman ) Blind Lemon Jefferson 's guitar around for him . <p> " " This is a family , a blues family . You have to establish in the world that it ai n't just about somebody popping up , selling the blues , and going about his business . This is a whole tradition here . "
