Almost as wondrous as the windup of Hideo Nomo has been his follow-through . Major league teams , eager for their own version of the Los Angeles Dodgers ' " Tornado , " are importing Japanese pitchers as never before imagined , and they are lighting up radar guns , enlivening batting-cage conversations and making names for themselves this spring . Shigetoshi Hasegawa , nicknamed " Shaggy " by his Anaheim Angel teammates , keeps 75 members of the Japanese media busy while charming American reporters with the revelation that he learned English by watching Field of Dreams  --  12 times . New York Yankee Katsuhiro Maeda has amused observers with both his sense of tradition  --  he bowed deeply before pitching batting practice to teammate and former Hanshin Tiger Cecil Fielder  --  and his sense of the absurd . Maeda , whose hair is bleached white , is known as " Rodman . " <P> But the biggest impression made by a Japanese pitcher this spring has been by " the Jellyfish . " That is what Hideki Irabu is known as back home , where , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused batters ' arms to go numb with the sting of his 95-m.p.h. fastball . ( The Marines used to sell stuffed Irabu Jellyfish dolls . ) Though he has yet to throw a pitch in a U.S. major league uniform , he has become Topic A in both the Cactus and Grapefruit leagues . <P> The Marines are willing to grant Irabu his freedom , but only to the San Diego Padres , with which the team has a working agreement . But Irabu 's hardball-playing agent , Don Nomura , has maintained all along that his client wants to pitch only for the Yankees . In a fax sent to all 30 major league teams last week , Nomura threatened to let Irabu sit out the year if the Yankees and Padres did not work out a deal , and soon . Nomura , who has become equally unpopular on both sides of the Pacific , recently incensed people by comparing Irabu 's plight to that of Japanese Americans put into internment camps during World War II . Still , the agent , who also represents Nomo and Maeda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being kept against his will , as if he were a prisoner , " Nomura says . " He is being held hostage to the special interests of baseball . " <P> The fight over Irabu , 28 , the Pacific League 's ERA leader for the past two years , has involved not only the Padres and Yankees , which tried to sign him unilaterally earlier this year , but also Major League Baseball and the Players Association . Is he worth it ? Is he worth the players ( a prospect , a pitcher and a starter ) and cash ( $3 million to $4 million ) that Yankees owner George Steinbrenner is supposedly dangling before the Padres ? Absolutely , says New York Mets manager Bobby Valentine , who managed the Marines and Irabu in 1995 . " He throws the ball as well as anyone in the world , " says Valentine . " On some days , he 's even a good pitcher . Once he gets acclimated and learns hitters , he 'll remove the fallacy that American baseball is better than Japanese baseball . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baseball , says , " Irabu has a much higher potential than Nomo . " That is lofty praise , considering Nomo is 29-17 with a 2.95 ERA in two years in the majors . But there are just as many doubters about Irabu as believers . " Maybe this guy is like Sydd Finch , the guy SPORTS ILLUSTRATED made up , " Yankee pitcher Brian Boehringer said last week .
