<p> After years of civil war during which armed militias held sway across Lebanon , the legitimate government put on an uncharacteristic display of authority recently , arresting a militia chief and a big-time drug smuggler . But the longstanding issue of armed groups operating with the approval of Syria on Lebanese soil remains unresolved . <p> President Clinton came away from his meeting with Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus in September with vague answers on the terrorist groups , guerrilla bands and Iranian-inspired Islamic networks still operating in Lebanon , according to a senior Lebanese official . <p> Damascus is considered the place to ask about such groups since Syria wields decisive influence in Lebanon , where 40,000 of its troops still help maintain order  --  and the armed groups would find it difficult to operate without their cooperation . But Assad avoided a commitment to halt acts of " national resistance " against Israelis and their Lebanese allies until the price of peace with Israel is in his pocket . <p> Assad has supported active resistance against Israeli forces in the strip of southern Lebanon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers from the Golan Heights . Israel captured the heights from Syria in 1967 . Assad also avoided addressing that question during his news conference with Clinton after their talks . <p> Divisions have appeared within the main Lebanese Islamic group , the Shiite-based Hezbollah , over what direction to take should Israel and Syria reach a peace agreement that includes Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon . The differences are likely to surface in debates at Hezbollah 's third general congress , scheduled for mid-1995 . <p> Decisions made at that congress will help shape Hezbollah 's role in a new Middle East . Although some Hezbollah leaders privately speak of a political role , die-hards such as Sheik Subhi Tufaily have vowed that Hezbollah guerrillas , estimated to number between 2,500 and 3,000 , will keep up anti-Israeli attacks even after Israeli troops have left southern Lebanon . More than a dozen Israeli soldiers and militiamen of the Israeli-sponsored South Lebanon army have been killed in such attacks in recent weeks . <p> Neither Syria nor Iran has tipped its hand on any of these Lebanese extremists who , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become instruments of Middle East realpolitik . Iran is still spending money in Lebanon , but there have been cuts in social services , the basic salary of the fighters has been slashed from $ 300 to $ 175 and women who used to get $ 100-a-month stipends for wearing the chador have been cut off . <p> Palestinian refugees , including their armed groups , also retain a degree of autonomy here , thanks in part to Syria . The Lebanese Army , for example , is still not allowed to enter the Palestinian camps in southern Lebanon . <p> In Beirut , Palestinian factions opposed to Arafat  --  called the " Damascus 10 "  --  control the camps of Burj al Barajinah , Sabra and Shatila and Mar Elias . " There are rings around the camps in Beirut . The first one is composed of Syrians and the second  --  the outer one  --  is Lebanese army , " explained a spokesman for one of the Palestinian factions . <p> When Hamas  --  the militant faction opposed to the Palestine Liberation Organization and active in Gaza and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among Palestinians were widely predicted . Instead , violence came in the Palestinian camp of Ain Helweh , just above the Lebanese port city of Sidon , between supporters of PLO leader Yasser Arafat and his opponents . <p> The battles in Ain Helweh left at least seven dead and 21 injured , causing many Lebanese to sneer at what they saw as a double standard . " What is upsetting us is this lie we are all living . We were told the war is over , all the weapons have been collected by the Lebanese army and then we hear of fighting in the camps , " a Lebanese businesswoman complained . <p> Hezbollah provides occasional training and assistance to Hamas supporters in the camps , according to senior Lebanese officials . Some activists from other Palestinian groups such as Fatah-Revolutionary Command , headed by Hassan Sabri Banna , known as Abu Nidal , or the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command , headed by Ahmed Jibril , are sometimes disciplined when they overstep the line , but none of their networks has been shut down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even ask about how other peace talks with Israel are proceeding before Syria clinches its deal . But many Lebanese fear that Syria would like to institutionalize the vacuum . Lebanese officials firmly in Syria 's grip appear to believe there is no alternative to waiting . <p> In the meantime , opposition to Syria is risky . The only militia leader who dared defy Damascus by not joining a Syrian-tailored government  --  Samir Geagea , a Christian  --  is also the only one who has been made a defendant in the first postwar trial for misdeeds during the civil war . <p> Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Bouez said in an interview that Lebanon has no interest in joining a " race or competition for a peace that may be deficient and that could be exposed to failure at any time "  --  a reference to recurring violence in the West Bank and the Gaza strip . <p> " We do n't think there is any harm in being last . We even think that Lebanon has a political advantage in being the last to sign , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of earlier cooperation between Christian militias and Israel . <p> Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri said he expects to sign a peace treaty next June or July . With Lebanese negotiators left out of any current talks with Israel , no one is quite sure what kind of treaty Lebanon would sign . Many here are beginning to doubt that either Israel or Syria is serious about pulling out of Lebanon . <p> When President Elias Hrawi dared propose that Lebanon would be willing to form a military commission with Israel once Israel declares its commitment to leave Lebanese soil , he was promptly rebuffed by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , who said that is up to Syria to decide . <p> Talks between Syria and Israel were suspended last year after the massacre of Muslim worshipers by an Israeli settler in Hebron . While their resumption has been announced , nothing has been said about Lebanon . " Let the Syrians finish up with the Israelis . Our turn will come , " Hariri said . <p> But others are not so sure . The specter of a Syrian-Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  looms large . <p> " Will Israeli occupation become a permanent fait accompli , in spite of  --  yes in spite of  --  a peace treaty ? " columnist Ghassan Tueini , a former Lebanese diplomat , asked last month . " Israel has no objections , as Rabin has said more than once , thinking he is endearing himself to Syria , if Syrian troops should remain in the Bekaa  --  which is better for Israel than them staying on the Golan . " <p> Lebanese officials were relieved earlier this month when the assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs , Robert Pelletreau , the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Lebanon in 14 months , came here . They also were heartened to learn that a new American ambassador will soon be named . The post has been vacant since Mark Hambley was pulled out early in August for undisclosed health reasons . <p> There were also hints that Washington may lift a ban on air links between Beirut and the United States and reconsider an embargo on travel there by U.S. citizens , due for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send military and security officers to Washington in January to try to have the travel ban lifted . <p> Senior Lebanese army officers cautiously coordinating with Syria insist that once orders come through , their army can deliver on peace and its requirements : the dismantling of armed factions and their enclaves in a country supposedly on the mend . <p> " It is not a problem of guns or training . We have found and collected so much from the militias that the Lebanese army can sell guns , " said a top-ranking Lebanese army officer . " Once there is a political decision , we can do anything , " he said of disarming the Iran-backed resistance fighters .
