No one had died all month . We were n't far enough into spring for the drag queens and cross dressers to be cleaning out their closets . <p> That meant the work was slow and the talk idle . Piled in front of us were heaps of clothes from Midwestern college students who found wool overcoats , skirts , dresses and sweaters useless in the mild Seattle winters . Tasha always said the stuff we collected at the shop was used but not used up . Tarique said one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . Hollis said , " How much can we get for it ? " I was a volunteer , so I did n't say anything at all . I guess I was there just to try to make life mean something . <p> " Wan na hear a joke ? " Tasha picked up a powder blue angora . She 'd taken to wearing cat's-eye glasses with no lenses in them . The roots of her short , yellow hair showed dark . <p> " Sure . " I held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notched lapel . Size four . Would n't you just know ? " Ummmmm ... Did you hear that Al Gore has termites ? " She was laughing hysterically before she even got to the last word . I could see the small silver ball on her pierced tongue jiggling . It was like ... l have no idea what it was like . <p> " No . " I said , not realizing that was the whole joke , expecting more , not really getting it . <p> " Al Gore ! Termites ! The guy is wooden for real ! Get it ? " <p> I guess she genuinely thought the jokes she told me were funny , but I suspected it was really the only thing she could think to say to me . It was good of her . I laughed as best I could and said , " That 's cute . " <p> We had disposed of the clothes by sorting them into bins , dividing the pile into smaller separate piles : one for hanging , one for folding . We discarded things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counter was clear again , Tasha lifted a box onto it and we started unboxing cracked and dingy Melmac plates and saucers , knickknacks , unscoured pans and plain white sheets . The sheets we could always use . I mean our clients . Some stages of AIDS mean night sweats so drenching that some people go through several changes in a single night . <p> " You know any jokes , Liz ? " <p> I thought about it , but I already knew I never remembered things like that . I only remembered really dumb ones , like What part of the body is also a flower ? Tulips . You know ? Two lips ? As bad as hers was , I could n't tell that . <p> " I 'm a terrible joke teller , " was all I said . Tasha had set another box on the counter and was pulling out scarves , belts , handkerchiefs and jewelry <p> " First person through the door 's going to buy these , " she held up a pair of colored rhinestone earrings , deep chartreuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ha ! Look at this ! " she held up the matching bracelet . " Ten dollars for the set ? You want to tag it ? " She handed the earrings and bracelet to me . " C'm on , Liz . You got to know one joke . " <p> " Yeah , yeah , I do . There 's these two guys .. let me think a minute . I 'll put these in the case and then I 'll be ready when I get back . " <p> I marked the set $10 and started around the counter . There were only a few people in the shop . One , Irene , was a regular who shopped for a women 's shelter . I was making my way around the sorting counter when she stuck her head through the open door . <p> " You guys are n't keeping any of the good stuff for yourselves , are ya ? " She was thin , beaten looking and smiling big ; I wondered if she was one salvaged from the shelter herself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mound of clothes , pulling out the size four suit , a couple of dresses and a pants suit , things Le good enough for a job interview . " Got anything bigger ? " <p> I pulled out a few more things and put lt them on the counter . " Come on in and os look for yourself , " I told her . <p> " Liz ? There 's these two guys ? And ? " <p> " Oh . There 's these two guys .. . no , let me get these things in the case first . " There was one case we kept locked . It was for at the good jewelry , and I decided to put the earrings and bracelet there . I found the key under the register , opened the case and put the earrings and bracelet next to a line of a dozen little silver rings . When I put them directly under one of the fluorescent lights that rimmed the top of the case , the blue and green stones projected rainbow-like arcs on the glass . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , her arms now loaded down with clothes . <p> " I think there 's about five over there on that shelf . Middle shelf near the window . " Her eyes followed the direction my finger pointed . " No clock radios , though . You want me to save your stuff for you ? You can just set it on the counter if you want . " I headed back to the sort room . " And ? " <p> " OK . There 's these two guys and they 're sitting in this bar having a beer after work . And one of them turns to the other one and says , You look troubled . Is something the matter ? " ' <p> When Hollis poked his head through the back door , the one that leads to the alley , and asked one of us to give him a hand , Tasha sighed and thrust the hanger and the shirt she was hanging down at her sides . How could she be so frustrated ? It was only a joke . Anyway , Hollis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just now come back . " You 're in the middle of something , " I said to Tasha . " I 'll go . " Well , I was closest to the door and had n't yet picked up anything new . Tasha was in the middle of hanging shirts . Okay , yeah , I was anxious to see what they 'd brought . In the alley , Tarique had pulled up the dirty blue van amid the open trash containers . Hollis was lighting a cigarette . Tarique came around to open the van doors . I could tell by their look that the scene had been grim , and when that was the case I never said anything . Sometimes the pickups were from old ladies whose families did n't know what else to do with their scarred and obsolete belongings , but sometimes the stuff was from one of ours . I had a feeling about this one . No one was saying a word , so I just went around to where Ta ri que stood looking into the open van doors and started unloading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of books from the floor of the front seat and preceded us into the shop . Finally , we had emptied out the van and began to go through the boxes , each of us taking one . <p> Before I knew it , I was holding in my hands a familiar shirt . Holding in my hands an amulet always worn around a neck . A teapot used to serve me tea . Serve me tea . I formulated sentences that started " is n't that ... " or " did n't this ... " but all that I managed was an " oh " of recognition . <p> We unpacked things slowly and carefully and without a word . It was like these were the last remains , the bones and guts of a life that had no one to live it anymore . <p> I 'd only known him as Dake . First name ? Last name ? I did n't know . Maybe it was n't even his name at all . And I 'd only been to see him one time , and then not out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollis had gone on vacation . I did n't know him well enough to mourn his passing in more than a superficial way ; I do n't mean the way we feel bad for the remote and generic deaths when a plane crashes or an earthquake hits . It was a little closer to home than that . More like someone on your block getting stabbed or someone in your building getting killed in a car wreck . <p> " What 's this ? " Tarique held up a wooden box , a perfect unpainted cube about eight inches square with no markings save for an inch-diameter red dot in the center of one of the sides ; in the center of the red dot was a tiny hole ringed by a thin gold band . We all gathered round to examine it . I 'd seen it before . In Dake 's apartment . Propping open the kitchen door . <p> " Here , let me see it . " Hollis reached for it . <p> " What 's this hole for ? " Tarique said . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box , but I knew it felt kind of good to be , all of us , gathered like this , united , standing around trying to figure things out . And I did n't say I knew there was a key that fit in that tiny gold ring in the middle of the red dot . I was just kind of going with the moment . Tarique shook the box and it rattled . He looked for a place to open it , but finding no latch or clasp and not realizing that the tiny hole was for a key , he just looked puzzled . We all did . <p> " Let me see it , " Hollis said again . " I think someone 's at the register . You better go take care of it . " Tarique was n't about to give up the box until he had finished his inspection . <p> Hollis harumphed , peeked into the store and reluctantly left to make the sale , muttering under his breath . <p> " What does that sound like ? " Tarique shook the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sounds like a pea or a bean or something to me , " Tasha guessed . " Maybe it 's a stone of some kind . You know , I mean a diamond . Something like that . " I 'd said that because I imagined that rendering something that inaccessible must mean it was valuable . Still , if what was inside were valuable , you 'd think it would have been wrapped in cotton or something . <p> " Now why would he put a diamond in there ? " Tasha clearly directed her remark toward me , but she kept her eyes riveted on the box . <p> " Why would he put in a pea ? " What else could I say ? <p> Tasha shrugged . " Is it some kind of musical instrument ? " <p> Tarique gave her his duh look . " Maybe he did n't put it in there at all . Maybe it was already in there when he got it . " " When he got it ? " I thought out loud . " Who would give this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have made it and it had to have been made to contain a particular thing . " <p> Tarique had put the box down , picked up a butter knife and gently pried at the seams of the box . When it failed to give way easily , he set the box down with the red dot at the top , put the butter knife down and went to talk to Hollis at the cash register . <p> Tasha 's turn . <p> She shook it . She turned it , examining every side , picked up the butter knife and took her turn prying gently at the seams . She straightened a paper clip to wiggle inside the hole in the red circle of the box . " You think a key fits in here ? " she asked . <p> " Looks too small for a key , " I told her truthfully . <p> I went back to sorting his things . " You knew him ? " I asked Tasha . " Who ? " <p> " This is his stuff . " <p> " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " He used to come in the shop . Was his stuff . " <p> " Oh . No , I do n't think his ho , " she once . Remember him serving " You ? " <p> " He used to come in the shop . Was even in his house once . Remember him serving tea from that pot over there . " She looked up then , thinking maybe I was having a bad moment or something . " He was pretty sick even then . That was about a year ago , " I said to let her know that it was OK . Frustrated , Tasha put the knife down and set the box once again with the red dot facing up . <p> " OK , " she said , her fists dug into her waist like she meant business . " There 's these two guys sitting in a bar and one turns to the other and says ? " She was going to make me tell this joke . <p> " Yeah . So , one guy turns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the matter ? " ' <p> Dake 's shirts were virtually useless . They looked like rejects from the thrift shop , stuff that went to the homeless or was bundled and sold by the ton to someplace like Botswana . I threw them in the trash . His shoes were pretty much the same story , but there were books and dishes that were salable , some silverware and a set of six glasses still in their original box . Whoever had cleaned up his place had taken all his framed pictures and snugged them between some towels-family pictures and three commercial glossy pictures of red , green and yellow peppers . On top of that were some photo albums . Tucked down the side of the box was a small jewelry case . I opened it . The case contained cuff links , a high school medal for high jump , a couple of buttons and a long , straight toothpick of a key with an all but invisible notch on the end . So the other guy says , My conscience is bothering me . ' And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that ? " ' It was the key to the box . I knew even though I had n't actually seen it ; it was the key chain I recognized . The key had stuck up out of that little red dot . A thick , satiny thread attached to a small painted bell was tied to the top of the key <p> Tasha was standing there expectantly , not moving , a hanger in one hand and a shirt in the other . <p> " So , the other guy says , ' I slept with one of my patients today " ' " You did n't say one guy was a doctor . " " Sorry . One guy was a doctor . " I guess it was wrong , but they were n't going to get anything for a thing like that , a funny key with a bell on it . OK , so that was n't the point . It was the key to the box , I knew it was the key and now I had it . Anyway , I wrapped the bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its bell in my pocket so casually that Tasha did n't even notice . Now , why did I do that ? I did n't even know yet myself . <p> " Was the other guy a doctor too ? " <p> " It does n't matter . " <p> " OK . Go on . " <p> " The other guy says , Oh , come on , do n't let it bother you . You are n't the first doctor to sleep with one of his patients . " ' Actually , I thought I was telling the joke pretty well , considering . I was closing in on the punchline and really had n't made any major mistakes . But it was sort of my turn to pick up the box , and I knew that would distract me . It was plain and smooth and raw . I do n't know woods all that well , but this did n't strike me as particularly expensive wood like , say , cypress or ebony It was more a common wood like oak or dark pine . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the corners of a picture frame and then it looked to have been glued together . <p> I put the box down and rested my hand on it . " So the guy says , ' l hats true , very true , but damn it , I 'm a veterinarian . " ' After a minute I said , " Well , I told you I could n't tell a joke . " <p> " That 's OK , " Tasha said . " We ca n't all play guitar like B.B. King . " She hung up the shirt and came closer , looking at the box again . <p> " What if soemthing awful 's in there ? " she said . On second thought , her hair was n't quite yellow , but maybe had a little tinge of green in it . " What do you mean ? Like what ? " " Like a dried-up , cut-off finger or something . Some powerful voodoo magic thing . " <p> Sometimes Tasha seemed like just a wise child , haphazardly tripping across wisdom one minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be embarrassed to say It was a thought , of course , but a pretty dumb one if you asked me . I shrugged . <p> " Let 's smash it open ! " Tasha looked around for something to smash it with . " I do n't think we should . " I picked up the box again and held it away from her . " It is n't ours and we have n't figured out yet if we can get it open ... I mean without breaking it . " <p> " Hey , if Hollis and Tarique had n't rescued it , it would be in the trash right now . What good is it anyway if we do n't know what it is ? Maybe there 's something in there that really is valuable . A diamond , like you said ? " <p> I did n't really know what to say to dissuade her . I mean , she was right , was n't she ? What good is something if you do n't even know what it is ? Still , I felt compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I could n't just stand there and hold the thing all day " There 's no diamond in here , Tasha . It 's probably like you said , an old dried-up finger or something . " <p> When Dake had let me in , he took the bag of medicine from me immediately and showed me to a chair in a small living room . His place reminded me of my grandmother 's house , with that kind of Early American furniture that 's all olive drab and squash orange and clocks with eagles on them . He sat stiffly on the edge of a day bed , not saying anything . At the end of the bed was a small TV sitting on a TV tray <p> " I 'll take this to the kitchen , " he said after a while . I could see that his clothes were too big for him . He was barefoot , but his hair had been combed neatly , in anticipation of my coming , I suspected . His apartment was on the first floor with windows that opened out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the windowsill were African violets . On the arms of my chair were little white doilies . " I 'll make us some tea , " he called from the kitchen . <p> That 's when I saw the box . Later , when he came into the shop , I remember hearing a bell from the back room where I was sorting clothes . He was just walking around the store , but I could hear the bell . I went out to put some shirts on the rack and saw Dake standing there and noticed the key and bell attached to a belt loop of his pants . <p> " That to scare off snakes ? " I teased him . He was already too serious with his sickness to laugh . Well , was n't much of a joke anyway <p> " No . It 's a replica of a Japanese temple bell . " <p> I looked at it more closely then , bending toward him to take a better look . " Miniature , of course , " he added , like I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ring the bell to make sure that the gods are awake to hear their prayers . " <p> " Good idea , " I said , and hung up my shirts . <p> I took the box out to Tarique and Hollis then , more to get it out of Tasha 's reach than to offer it for sale , and set it on the counter next to the cash register . Business had picked up a bit . There were a few Eastsiders doing the thrift-shop circuit , some college students rebuying what other college students had donated , Connie the homeless guy who would periodically pretend to try on shoes and then walk out in a better pair that he 'd walked in with and Dudley from the body-piercing and tattooing shop next door . He was rummaging through the vinyl records . <p> " Got any Jerry Vale in here ? " <p> " Yeah , I think . Look in that last section . " Hollis was leaning over the glass counter , pointing . <p> Dudley found two LPs and brought them over so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking at the jewelry I 'd set in the case that morning . The earrings and bracelet were still there . <p> " What 's that ? " Dudley indicated the wooden box . <p> " A box , " Hollis told him . <p> " What 's it do ? " <p> " Not sure . " <p> " What 's that red dot for ? " Hollis shrugged . <p> " How much you want for it ? " <p> " Have n't priced it yet . " <p> " Well , when you do , let me know how much you want , OK ? " He started to leave , but then turned to Hollis . " Hey , I got about 20 really good nose rings . Trade ' em to you for that box . " <p> " I 'll think about it . " Hollis turned to me . " Bring out those polo shirts , Liz . There 's buyers in the store . " <p> In the sorting room , Tasha was standing there looking like she 'd forgotten something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she took a sorted bin from under the counter , picked up the pricing gun and set the amount to one dollar . I gathered all the shirts , including the polo shirts , taking them out to distribute along the rack . As I passed the register , I heard someone else asking about the box . When they 'd left , I asked Hollis , " So , how much for the box ? " <p> " I 'm thinking maybe we 'll just keep it . " " Keep it ? " <p> " Yeah . As kind of a metaphor . " <p> " A metaphor for what ? " Hollis looked at me blankly " Whattaya mean ? " <p> " Well , you mean a metaphor for the mystery of life ? For the secrets of Dake 's life ? A kind of reliquary or coffin ? A metaphor for what ? " <p> " Does n't have to be a metaphor for anything , does it ? " <p> I wanted to say , yes , if it 's a metaphor then it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made to mean something . It 's the law . <p> Instead I said , " I guess not . " <p> " Do you think the dot goes at the top ? " he said . <p> " Seems right to me , " I said . Dake 's life had n't been much . Well , maybe to Dake it had . Bottom line , that 's all we got . And his ended in a kind of isolated pain with all his stuff in a thrift shop . Could be worse . Maybe . <p> Really , I had all but forgotten about the key until I started undressing for bed . I turned the pocket out and there it was . I could n't think what made me put it in my pocket in the first place except all of us standing around that box . And now , Hollis was going to keep it there by the register , a mystery box that brings people together the same way as when the face of the Virgin suddenly appears on a barn door in Iowa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
