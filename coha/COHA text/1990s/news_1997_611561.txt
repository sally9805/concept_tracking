<p> His father is a pediatric surgeon , his wife is a dentist and he 's an architect . But since Hector Mayorga moved here from Mexico last year , he 's had to shelve his middle-class pedigree to slog around on subways in Queens in the middle of the night . <p> He heads out at midnight for a CVS drug store in Forest Hills , where he unloads trucks for $ 7.50 an hour . At 8 a.m. he goes to Flushing , where he puts in another six hours running errands for an architect . Then he returns to his aunt 's house in Corona , where he sleeps until it 's time to go back to the drug store . <p> " I have to work like a laborer , but it is not important . I need money , " says Mayorga , who is 30 years old . " I have a really great appreciation that this country has given me the opportunity to work . " <p> Mayorga 's workday may sound implausibly virtuous , like one of those elbow-grease stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it suggests a fundamental reason why the largest city in the United States has staged a remarkable comeback . <p> At the end of the 20th century , New York is soaking up immigrants at nearly the same torrid pace as at the beginning of the century . And the city is thriving , in large measure , because hundreds of thousands of these new New Yorkers are reenacting grandpa 's elbow-grease story . <p> Instead of Italians , it 's Dominicans . Instead of Irish , it 's Mexicans . Instead of Russians and Poles , well , in fact , it 's a new generation of Russians and Poles . Each year this decade , the city has absorbed 113,000 or so newcomers , many of them with the education , the dreams and the drive of Hector Mayorga . <p> For an aging , debt-ridden city under pressure to cut services , immigrants are a windfall . They are relatively cheap to govern  --  and , in some cases , easy to exploit  --  because they do n't complain much about what other New Yorkers regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " People who are immigrants have lower expectations , " Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani ( R ) said in an interview , comparing them with native New Yorkers who he said often take city services for granted and are more inclined to " get angry and think they have been failed . " <p> In 1920 , just after the crest of America 's greatest wave of immigration , 40 percent of New Yorkers were foreign-born . That fell to 18 percent in the 1970s , a decade in which the city lost 10 percent of its population , as it skidded into a bleak era of near-bankruptcy , crime and abandoned housing . Now , about a third of New Yorkers are foreign-born , with another 20 percent the offspring of new immigrants . Buoyed by this flood of newcomers , the population is holding steady , there is hardly an empty apartment in the city and the economy is stronger than it 's been in decades . <p> " This city was dying in the 1970s , " says Peter D. Salins , a senior fellow at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 100,000 immigrants a year has helped mightily . " <p> Immigrants here are salving a number of chronic ailments  --  suburban flight , erosion of the tax base , long-term dependency on social services  --  that hobble many big American cities . A troubled case in point is the District of Columbia , which , despite sharp increases in its foreign-born population , has been unable to offset the even greater number of residents who have moved out . <p> New York demographers credit immigrants with heading off a potentially " catastrophic " population drain . For as the immigrants poured into the city in recent years , longtime New Yorkers poured out , at a rate of more than 100,000 a year . <p> " Cities , by their very nature , are places that some successful people leave . They get married , they have children , they want a different kind of environment for raising their kids , " says Joseph B. Rose , director of the city 's planning department . " What is important is that you have new people coming in to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work . " <p> Immigrants , quite literally , save the homes of those who 've fled to the suburbs . It works this way : A number of immigrant families move into a dwelling that used to be a single-family house , and they pool their incomes to pay the rent . In so doing , the planning department says they rescue New York 's aging stock of privately owned housing that is " most vulnerable to abandonment . " <p> New York has been resuscitated as much by the quality of its new immigrants as by their number . As compared with native-born New Yorkers , recent immigrants are less likely to use social services , more likely to have jobs and more likely to own businesses , according to a city analysis of census figures . <p> " We come here with a focus , " says Natalia Sabatino , a Dominican immigrant who teaches at a Catholic preschool in Queens . " We did n't have a welfare system where we were born . Some New Yorkers know the system and how to use it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> And not just any work . Thirty percent of immigrant women this decade arrived with professional and technical training , a figure that is twice the level of the 1980s . City planners credit changes in federal immigration law in 1990 , which granted preferences to people with occupational skills in short supply and allowed entry to more immigrants without family ties . <p> Immigrants , too , are considerably younger than native New Yorkers . They are also much more likely to have children . Immigrant women constitute about a third of the female population , but they have 43 percent of the city 's babies . <p> New York City politicians , keenly aware of where their bread is buttered , can not say enough good things about immigrants . <p> " This city is the great example of why immigration can be an extremely positive thing for America , " said Giuliani , a Republican who accuses both political parties of " pandering " to anti-immigrant prejudices . <p> Part of the reason why Giuliani , along with nearly every New York business leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hundreds of thousands of low-paying jobs it takes to keep the city running . <p> Their willingness to bear long hours and hardship at work is often echoed in their silent tolerance of living conditions and social services that make native New Yorkers howl . Joseph J. Salvo , a demographer for the city , said immigrants are behaving almost exactly as they behaved at the turn of the century . As was the case then , Salvo said , immigrants do not complain because they genuinely believe their lives are better than they were back home . <p> " We do n't use the proper reference points . Those reference points are Santa Domingo , Port-au-Prince , Beijing . . . . What is overcrowding to us , what is quality of life to us , is not so much to these people , " Salvo said . <p> Many who work with New York immigrants are less sanguine . Immigrants tend to suffer in silence , according to a number of urban policy specialists here , because of language problems , unfamiliarity with their legal rights and fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts agree that immigrant parents are far more tolerant of the city 's severely overcrowded classrooms and crumbling school buildings than are native-born New Yorkers . Similarly , housing specialists say immigrants accept housing that is overcrowded to the point of being dangerous , even as they conscientiously pay their rent . <p> A fire in Queens killed four immigrants last month in a multi-tenant house that had jerry-rigged electric wiring and was illegally subdivided to pack in renters . The deaths dramatized the city 's cost-saving decision to reduce the number of building inspectors in Queens by a third since 1990 , even as the number of new immigrants living in that borough grew by more than 200,000 . <p> " The city is flouting a lot of the regulatory control that we had established this century as to what is good , safe housing , " said Frank Branconi , head of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council . " We have almost conceded that those kind of housing standards can no longer prevail . It is the downside of the immigration . " <p> Another downside that troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's black and Puerto Rican communities , is that immigration eases the pressure on city government to deal with the intractable problems of the long-term unemployed . <p> Black leaders , though , play down tensions between African Americans and immigrants . <p> " I think there is some resentment , but at the same time I think it is overblown . I do n't think African Americans go out and say , ' Oh , those damn Asians , ' " said Dennis Walcott , president of the New York Urban League . " People see that they have provided a major push to revitalize black neighborhoods , by opening stores , buying homes and being renters . " <p> An important consequence of accelerated immigration here , particularly in Brooklyn and Queens , is that it apparently has helped reduce crime in many neighborhoods , even as those neighborhoods become poorer and more crowded . <p> " It is kind of a paradox , " said Mike Curtis , an anthropologist who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice . " I see Latino neighborhoods that have definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of families in houses , where they ca n't afford to buy food , but we have not really seen an increase in crime . <p> " These first-generation immigrants are much less crime-prone . They are fearful of being locked up and deported . So they are taking off-the-books jobs and keeping their mouths shut . They are simply not the kind of people to go out and mug somebody , " said Curtis . <p> Archie Bunker 's Home <p> Queens was the fictional home of Archie Bunker , the 1970s television character who was famously intolerant of blacks and Puerto Ricans . Bunker 's bigotry , owing to a tidal wave of immigration in that borough , is now badly out of date . <p> " Archie Bunker would have a terrible time knowing whom to resent . He would not be able to figure it out . He would be too confused , " says demographer Salvo . <p> While Bunker would be racially vexed and linguistically overwhelmed , he would not be unfamiliar with the house-proud , family-centered values of many non-white immigrant neighborhoods in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , live in a middle-income section of Jackson Heights where homes look almost exactly as they looked 30 years ago . Italian and Jewish owners have long since moved to suburbs on Long Island and elsewhere , replaced by what Haydee Pineda , who runs a Head Start program in Queens , calls a " United Nations " of middle-class homeowners . She and her neighbors are vigilant members of a block association that she says does not tolerate abandoned cars , illegal sublets or noisy teenagers . <p> " We take care every day so the community does n't go down , " said Haydee , whose husband is a computer technician . Together they have sent five children through college and have lived in the same Jackson Heights house for 26 years . <p> Not far from Jackson Heights , Hector Mayorga and his wife moved last year into a rather less stable Queens neighborhood . Corona is boiling over with immigrants , more of whom arrive every week . Since the 1970s , it has gone from predominantly Jewish and Italian , to African American , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past few years , to a stew of Colombians , Central Americans , South Americans , Chinese , Indians , Pakistanis , Koreans and Mexicans . Just since 1990 , more than 10,000 new immigrants have moved into Corona , swelling the population by more than 15 percent . Amid the crush of newcomers , Mayorga is lucky . His widowed aunt , Gloria Romera , who arrived from Mexico in the 1960s , owns a sizable duplex . She has given Mayorga and his wife a bedroom for themselves . Her adult son , George , sleeps in the second bedroom , and she occupies the third . Her eldest son , Jose , along with his wife and their young son , live upstairs in the second apartment . <p> By Corona standards , such accommodations are palatial . For in recent years there has been almost no new housing construction in this neighborhood of small single-family houses . Instead , many thousands of houses have been converted , often illegally , into " mattress mills , " where each room is rented to a separate family and residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that New York , after investing $ 5 billion in the 1980s to increase low-cost housing by about 40,000 units , is again running dangerously low on safe and affordable dwellings . City budget constraints , along with cuts in federal aid , have all but halted major new housing programs . <p> " The politicians are very hot on how immigration is good for the city . They should complete the picture and make sure those immigrants have a decent place to live , " said Kathleen Dunn , an executive at the nonprofit Community Preservation Corp . <p> Dunn , who worked for 16 years with the city 's housing program , says it is common knowledge that the cost of quality housing in New York is higher than new immigrants can afford to pay . Unless the government steps in , immigrants have to live in substandard , unsafe conditions , Dunn said . <p> Church and School <p> The crush of immigrants in Corona is visible most Sunday mornings in the street outside Our Lady of Sorrows Roman Catholic Church . Although the Rev. Thomas Healy now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says he usually ca n't avoid a spillover of worshipers . <p> Healy says logistical concerns also have forced him to impose a limit of no more than 15 babies at any one baptism : " I do that because you lose your place . You do n't know where you are . Otherwise , it is like being at Shea Stadium . " <p> An elementary school in Corona , P.S. 19 , has a official student capacity of 1,375 students . The school now has 2,680 students  --  speaking 25 different languages . They attend classes in hallways and stairwells . Playgrounds around the school are parking lots for portable classrooms . It takes four lunch periods , from 10 to 2 , to feed all the students . " We are the largest elementary school in New York City , probably the largest in the country , " said principal Nicholas Apostolo . <p> Overcrowding and distracting noise in the school , plus language and cultural problems , contribute to student reading and math scores that are far below the city average . But few parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents are very belligerent . It is completely different here , " said Apostolo . " When they come to speak to anyone at this school , they are often fearful . They do n't speak English and they do n't really know how to help their kids . " <p> The passivity of immigrant parents is a factor in the steep decline of the city school system , education experts agree . Foreign-born parents have little clout with school boards because they tend not to vote . <p> " There was no hammer there , " said Ramon C. Cortines , who tried to reverse the situation when he was chancellor in the early 1990s . " The professionals lowered their standards , including the standards of behavior . " <p> For more than two decades New York has been known for having both the nation 's largest school system and many of the worst schools . Families who otherwise loved city life moved to the suburbs for better schools . Many of those that remained placed their children in private schools , watching at a distance as public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more students than seats in city schools . <p> Giuliani cut more than $ 1 billion from projected school spending during his first two years in office . He did so at a time when the number of students , due mostly to immigration , was growing by about 20,000 a year . Budget cuts swelled class sizes and reduced maintenance . In this election year , the mayor has recommended $ 172 million in additional spending , along with nearly $ 1 billion over several years for classrooms and computers . Education , the mayor says , will be the major focus of his second term . <p> While they may be passive about what happens at school , immigrant parents in Corona demand that their children go every day , says principal Apostolo . Attendance at his school is 93 percent , slightly higher than the city average . <p> " These kids come from low-income parents , about 80 percent of them are eligible for our free lunch program , " said Apostolo . " But it would be wrong to think in poverty stereotypes about these kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids come from families trying very hard to plant a stake in the community . " <p> Teenage Culture Gap <p> Mi hui Pak arrived in Queens from Korea when she was in second grade . She grew up in a series of one-bedroom apartments , together with her father , a plumber , and her mother , a cook , and her two older brothers . <p> She attended an overcrowded grade school that she says did n't teach her much . By her own admission , Pak , now 18 , is often lost when it comes to American teenager culture . She has always worn hand-me-down clothes from her cousins . And she fears she has committed many unforgivable social gaffes . <p> " My friend Shelley asked me , like , ' Do you know what the Gap is ?

It is frustrating and I am often angry when they ask me to translate something , " Pak wrote in an essay that won her an award from Manhattan 's exclusive Barnard College . An English word that Pak 's mother did learn in her 12-hour days at a Korean grocery was one that began with the letter " F.
