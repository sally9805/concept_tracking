LIVING THE DREAM Headnote Tina Miller bought her new land , built her home , and supplied the utilities for less than the price of a family car . Here 's how . By Tina Miller // Two years ago , coming out of a marriage that should never have been , I was determined to take care of myself . At fortysix , feeling very middle-aged and alone , my utmost desire was to have a nest of my own . My dilemma was that I had only $5,000 and no job . I wanted to live an alternative lifestyle on the land , and I had long before made a promise to myself that I would accomplish this without going into debt . The promise also included a conviction that I would never look back . Making a Profit from Buying Land Finding affordable land was a challenge . I needed something I could buy-with a small down payment and low monthly payments-that was dividable yet attractive enough that I would want to live there the rest of my life . I was also aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn it into my Shangri-la ; really gorgeous land was far beyond my pocketbook . Watching the land ads in the newspapers and contacting almost every real estate agent in a hundred-mile area in southeastern Arizona-the area I chosewas an education in itself . I stuck to my price range and did not look at more expensive properties , even though agents desperately tried to push me that way . Once I found a few candidates , I went to the planning and zoning department of the county to find out if the land was dividable and what , if any , restrictions applied . Do not trust anyone 's word on these matters . Go to planning and zoning and get their recommendations in writing . The process may well be Greek to you , but as long as you make it plain that you require the kindergarten explanation , almost everyone will be extremely helpful . Even if you are going through real estate agents to find your land , be prepared to do most of the legwork yourself . They do not make large commissions on cheap land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and money showing it . Photograph Above : Tina and Walt in front of the dream home . Left Walt wiring the home for both 12V and 110V . Tina takes a break from moving mud . // I found many ranchers , farmers , and large property owners selling off forty-acre parcels , generally with 20% down and monthly payments for ten to fifteen years at 10% interest . Once you find your land , go through a reputable title company and be sure to do a title search before the deal closes . The last thing in the world you want is to be unable to get a clear deed to a piece of land because of title complications . I finally located thirty-six acres here in southeastern Arizona . The land was remote enough to provide privacy , yet close enough-about twenty miles-to a large town where decent jobs were a reasonable drive away . The land was beautiful , with 360 deg views of the Mule and Huachuca Mountains . The desert vegetation was wonderful : ocotillo , prickly pear cactus , mesquite trees , hackberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wild birds , and even an occasional rattlesnake . The trade-off for cheap , beautiful land was a very deep water table , very nearly a thousand feet down . Electric and phone service were not available . The lack of utility service did n't really keep me up at night , but I own a horse that drinks ten gallons a day ! More on that in a bit . The land fit all of my criteria and the purchase price was affordable : $26,500 , with down payment and closing costs of $4,000 . I jumped into the deep end and bought it . The bank financed the loan for fifteen years at 10% interest , which put the monthly payments at $278 . Of course that would not do , so I took my last $1,000 , had the land surveyed , and split it into five parcels : three nine-acre lots and two fourand-a-half-acre lots . Getting a survey done was nearly as exhausting a process as finding the land . Calling every survey company in the book yielded five different quotes . The lowest bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pocket . A little negotiating lowered the price , and I in turn agreed to assist in the surveying . I did all the gofer work , held equipment , etc . Once the survey was finished and recorded , I had the property descriptions and papers drawn up by a reputable title company . They would be paid when the parcels were sold . I promptly found four eager buyers for my split parcels . I sold the two nine-acre parcels for $12,000 each and the four-anda-half-acre parcels for $8,000 each . Finding the buyers was fairly easy . When I found the whole thirty-six-acre parcel , I put the word out immediately that I was splitting and selling off parcels . I was also selective about whom I sold to , as I knew they would end up being my neighbors . A couple of parcels were sold " on time , " or through what is called a land contract . I received 20% down . They paid all the closing costs and agreed to make monthly payments for ten years at 10% interest . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms if you want the cash up front , but be prepared to get less than the original selling price in the process . Locating and purchasing the land , splitting it up , and selling the parcels took all of about forty-five days . I then had my nine acres paid for , my $5000 back , and a nice $13,500 profit from the sale of my lots : seed money to start building my home . // Cost of the Dream // My salvation was my sixty-nine-yearold brother-in-law Walt and my sister Jill , who live nearby in Bisbee , Arizona . They believed in my venture from the beginning and encouraged me to pursue my dream , even when it was just that . Mi Casa Walt is my teacher , my mentor , my building brain , my extra pair of hands , and my hero . While we considered the project , he insisted upon two things from the beginning . Numero uno was " Do it right and build to code . " We have no building codes in Cochise County , Arizona but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Numero dos was his stipulation that he would teach me how to do the work , not do the work himself while I watched . Not even for a moment did he treat me like a nincompoop , even when I asked some howlingly dumb questions and did some mighty dumb things . I decided on a plan for a **26;1148;TOOLONG adobe casita , designed around a passive-solar heating and cooling floor plan , with south-facing windows and a tin roof with two porches , to aid water collection . I initially purchased the stabilized adobe block and mud , but adobe can also be readily made ; I have made it for other projects . All the lumber , doors , bathroom fixtures , windows , headers , etc. , were scrounged from local junkyards or were given to me . At first , the process of snooping around for excess materials made me slightly uncomfortable , but I quickly came to the conclusion that being broke and shy created mutually useless situations . I stopped at re-modeling jobs , new construction sites , even the dump . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could use . With a little luck , I was able to trade these extra materials for items I needed . Enthusiasm is contagious . Share your dream , and you 'll find goodwill in the farthest corners and the darkest spaces . I had the foundation and the roof done by licensed contractors . They were beyond the scope of Walt 's and my abilities , and of course turned out to be my biggest expenses . Walt and I did rest the by ourselves , from mixing mud and laying the adobe , to installing windows , headers , bond beam , gas lines , plumbing etc . Construction First , I laid out the floor plan , with emphasis on properly siting the windows and doors . We then built the door frame and set it in place . Next , we put up story poles on the corners , so the building would go up straight and plumb . We could then begin laying the adobe block . I would mix the mud , and wheelbarrow it to Walt . He laid most of the block . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiring on a course of block and covered it with metal flashing . All wood exposed to adobe was covered with metal lathe , so the mud would stick . As the adobe reached the top of the windows and door frames , we placed headers , using railroad ties I purchased for $3 each at the dump . We left a foot on either side to stabilize and tie-in the adobe walls . One foot further we put in anchor bolts and began framing-in for a concrete bond beam . A bond beam is a continuous pour of concrete , tying the whole structure together . We framed up a box ten inches high and twelve inches thick , wired it into place , and then ran a continuous double row of rebar , circling the entire structure . We left the foundation anchor-bolts exposed by several inches that later allowed us to tie-in the wood top-plate . We hired a concrete pumper to do the pour . We removed the wood frames and then reused them for the top-plate . Finding carpenters to put on the roof was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it , a drop in any contractor 's normal budget bucket . The quotes came in and were several thousand dollars more than I could afford . Just when I was ready to settle for a flat roof with no porches , a contractor team of two brothers came to my rescue . Mark and Mike Gruey of Bisbee , Arizona , agreed to supply used lumber and more than honest and fair workmanship in producing a very high grade of galvanized tin roof . They cut their profit to help me , and in return I have recommended them highly for other jobs . With the roof installed , we put in the windows , Sheetrocked the ceiling , plastered the inside walls with adobe , painted the walls white with a lime plaster , and painted the concrete floor . Walt and I built all the sink cupboards and closets with used lumber we scrounged or were given . We worked every day for three months . In January , 1996 , I set foot into my new home . We set up a two-thousand-gallon water tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof ; the water runs from a gutter system into the tank . A 12V demand pump supplies the house with water , but drinking water has to come from the town-a small compromise with independence , but I can live with it . One inch of rain gives me about eight hundred gallons of free water . My horse and I split six hundred gallons fifty-fifty . The house is all solar-powered . Two 80W solar panels , mounted on the roof and facing south , supply power to four 6V batteries wired in series to produce 12V power . I use it to power the demand pump , cellular phone , and 12V television and VCR I also have an inverter that gives me 110V to run conventional lights , a radio , fan , blender , and word processor . On those rare occasions when I need to dress up , I heat an old-fashioned iron in a frying pan and use a propane curling iron . My solar system is very simple , extremely affordable , and is designed so that I could easily add more panels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a generator for emergencies . It was used to run power tools while building the house , but I rarely use it now . Propane powers my refrigerator , gas stove , and the six-gallon water heater . I heat the house with a woodburning stove , but even in the winter , the sun keeps the house warm until sunset . Extra Room Photograph Above : windows framed and adobe going up . Below . Tina throws some mud up to Walt . Right : Walt placing one of the several scrounged windowpanes used to make picture windows . // The Gruey brothers carpenters had an old wood shed in their backyard . I purchased it from them with the intention of setting up a simple shed . Soon , with much help from the brothers , we added two porches to the small shed , rocked up a foundation , finished the inside , and saw that we had produced not only a tack room and bead house ( for crafts ) , but space enough to run a home business . All the esthetic items in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cactus landscaping , ocotillo fences , used lumber . We built a two-seater outhouse , to code , with used lumber . Outhouses and composting toilets are legal here . A septic tank is a must for the black water ; sink or gray water can be filtered and used on plants .

Below ( with Walt in the background caught at an unfortunate moment ) poses next her recent plumbing solution . // While working with foundation rocks , I quickly became enthused and decided to attempt a rock building by myself . What started out to be a tool room turned into a guest house and cantina . Every morning for about six months , I would haul one or two loads of rocks and sand from alongside our rocky roads . I dug a ten-inch-deep footer for a ten-by-fourteen-foot house , purchased fifteen ninety-pound bags of Portland cement and began laying up the rocks . I set a door frame and found two used windows . As the walls reached shoulder height , my slight frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a helper for the week at $40 a day . The rafters were four-inch pine poles my daughter let me cut from her mountain property . The roofing cost me about $100 . Within a week , the casa was finished , for a total cost of $390 . I even built an adobe rock fireplace . While not an adventure in gorgeous design , the fireplace looks the part , warms the cantina , and the smoke goes up . I accomplished all this in less than a year , with $5,000 in my pocket and no job . Today I own my casita , my land , have electricity , hot and cold running water , and no bills , ever . After the initial land purchase , lot sales , and minus building expenses , I figure my nest actually cost me $510 . After this experience , the best advice I can give anyone is : just follow your dream . When things seem monumental-and they will-do n't look at the total picture . Take one day at a time . Dwell on figuring out the problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is overcoming them . I have my castle , now the only thing missing is a prince ! <p>
