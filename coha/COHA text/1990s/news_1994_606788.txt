<p> See You Later , Alligator : On the Road in the Everglades <p> You name your particular stretch of white-lined blacktop " Alligator Alley " and you 're going to attract three types of people : the brave , the illiterate and the very , very nervous . <p> This particular family is a definite Type Three . But there we were , with an overwhelming need to go from here on the Atlantic Ocean to there on the Gulf of Mexico , and the only logical way to do that was to hack our way west through the Everglades , along the road famed for multi reptiles and mini ( which is to say no ) bathrooms . So we swallowed hard after breakfast and filled the car with the bare essentials : sunglasses , map , alligator repellent , pith helmets , flares , wills . <p> I 'm exaggerating , of course . We did n't take a map . We thought we 'd packed it . But then five or six miles into our journey we decided to check the map again ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was no map , which made for some pretty frantic moments , followed almost immediately by some pretty quiet moments , as each of us considered the near certainty , any minute now , of our swampy demise . <p> So what if Alligator Alley is straight as a stick ? So what if there are no exits for 20 and 30 miles at a stretch ? Does n't matter  --  without a map , we 'll make a wrong turn anyhow . And when the alligators start to surround our muck-trapped car  --  without a map , we 'll have nothing to swat them away with ! <p> Except that we did n't see any alligators . What we saw instead , bordering the Alley for miles and miles , was metal fencing six feet high if it was a foot , with strands of barbed wire on top . Is anyone breeding pole-vaulting gators ? Gators with wire cutters ? Unlikely . Then so was the prospect of a sudden slither across the road . We started to breathe easier . <p> Then we started to yawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire , but no alligators . And nothing else either  --  not an egret , nor a heron . ( Not even a pickled heron . ) Just a few cars rolling along ahead of us , a few cars behind , and the people inside looking every bit as unfulfilled as we were . <p> What 's the story here ? We made turns on Florida 's Turnpike , did n't we ? We saw grass on the Sawgrass Expressway . So where are the alligators on Alligator Alley ? <p> Forget it , said our Gulfside expert when we 'd finally reached our destination  --  Alligator Alley just is n't what it used to be . They 'd recently gone and made a nearly normal interstate out of it , he said : extra lanes , shoulders for pull-offs , median strips  --  and fences all along the way , to keep the humans and the nonhumans a comfy distance from one another . <p> So much for any chance of real adventure . Just to shake things up on the return trip , we stopped at the Miccosukee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a live package of Reese 's Peanut Butter Cups . <p> And that was the absolute peak of our wilderness experience . No thrills , no spills , no rampaging alligators . What a bore ! <p> What a relief . <p>  --  Rick Horowitz <p> In Uzbekistan , That Sinking Feeling <p> When my parents  --  who loved and trusted ships  --  flew to Europe for the first time , my father sent me terse instructions for dealing with their estate . He summarized their financial and legal affairs and the location of valuables , and added , " Do n't rush and sell our house cheap . It 's way up in value . " There was a chilling addendum : " Do n't bring our bodies back . It 's ridiculously expensive . " Also a brief P.S. : " My new gray suit is at the cleaners . " <p> The night before my husband and I set off for a trip to Uzbekistan , we updated and embellished our own **26;524;TOOLONG letter . Because our schedule included four laps on Aeroflot and four on Uzbekistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joking Now ?

You decide , " I wrote . " Please save some pieces of my jewelry for Emily , Lily and Tanya , " I added , tearfully , envisioning the exquisite little granddaughters I 'd never see again . <p> I reread the article that concluded , " Do not fly to , in or over Russia " as 3we awaited the late take-off of our first Aeroflot flight , from London to Moscow . The large jet had seats that collapsed forward at a touch , rickety tray tables that slanted lapward , knobs and switches and light fixtures that dangled . " This delay is nothing technical , " the flight attendant told us , as we moved about the cabin looking for an unbroken seat with a functioning seat belt . " Only perhaps no fuel . " <p> And suddenly , without any announcement and with passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane took off and began cruising smoothly . <p> Actually , getting to Uzbekistan was n't our only concern . The country , we had read , was anticipating invasion from nearby Afghanistan and/or Tajikistan at any time . ( Another reason to go now , we told each other . ) We also had heard talk of street crime , and a doctor at a dinner party had gone on about cholera and rabid dogs . Our travel agent became rather sly when pressed for advice . " Prepare for an adventure , " he said . " Bring snacks . Bring plenty of water . " <p> We went prepared and had a mostly fine time prowling the hot and dusty streets of the wondrous cities of Bukhara , Samarkand , Khiva and Tashkent . We survived every alarming flight , incommodious hotel and appalling meal . For those who are tired of bossy flight attendants , the airlines of the Commonwealth of Independent States provide a new experience . No one cares whether or where you smoke or whether you fasten your seat belt , raise your seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and descends or stow your carry-on luggage under the seat . There are no seat assignments , no drink carts , no announcements on domestic flights in any language except Russian or Uzbek . " Meal " service is a plastic cupful of warm , chalky mineral water , sometimes accompanied by crackers . <p> Since flights are canceled day after day if they 're not filled , all flights that actually take off are jammed with people who hoist down the aisle anything they do n't wish to entrust to the baggage compartment . Such as huge boxes lugged aboard by two panting men . Such as sacks five feet high containing God knows what . Such as a replacement car door . Somehow , our overloaded planes got off the ground and landed safely . <p> Between flights , we pushed through exotic crowded bazaars , climbed to the top of Khiva 's old city walls , picked up shards of turquoise mosaic tile , walked on the ancient Silk Road behind a horse-drawn bus , watched old men sell snuff and play chess and dominoes under skinny trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull caps . We photographed the pleated turquoise dome of Tamerlane 's mausoleum and the spectacular Registan in Samarkand . We walked three times around the 10th-century Ismail Samani Mausoleum in Bukhara  --  perhaps the most beautiful building in the world  --  to ensure that our wishes would come true . We visited the museums in Tashkent , with their splendid displays of ancient embroidered royal robes . <p> And we queried everyone we met who spoke English  --  a total of five Uzbekistanis , two Americans , two Pakistani lawyers and a whole tourful of gung-ho Brits . Unfortunately , the roster of English-speakers did not include anyone on the staff of our four hotels , so we were unable to get answers to such inquiries as **25;552;TOOLONG and **26;579;TOOLONG and **35;607;TOOLONG and what's-on-the-menu . This was , we knew , part of the adventure . We also knew , after a day or two , that the answers would not please us . <p> Uzbekistan  --  rich in history , stunningly photogenic , desperately poor and , according to our few informants , intensely regretful to be free of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even aside from its plane flights , not for the faint-hearted . Hotel rooms are dark or hot or buggy or grimy or all of the above , and bathrooms primitive . Beds with coarse , mended sheets collapse , and towel racks fall off the wall . In the worst , spooky men wander the halls and knock during the night to offer prostitutes and other commodities , and hours before dawn police bang loudly demanding your passport . In others , the problems of food shortage and food quality that diminish the lives of the people who live there filter down to the few hotel guests . <p> Lunches and dinners were identical and typically featured salad ( dangerous ) , soup ( untasty ) , old mutton ( uncuttable and unchewable ) or ground kabobs ( made of even poorer quality meat ) . Rice , a major crop in the country , appeared rarely . Uzbek bread , delicious when fresh , was invariably served stale . There was plenty of green tea , served in small bowls . <p> One hotel , near Khiva , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests who wished to remain healthy to drink green tea after eating fruit , never water . This raised our expectations . We prowled the bazaar looking for peelable fruit , to no avail . Five days later in Bukhara we spied and purchased , with some excitement , a large round fruit with smooth orange skin , which proved to be a lemon . Squeezed and mixed with warm mineral water and artificial sweetener it made  --  we were that low  --  a delicious refreshing beverage . <p> In the end , we did not experience aerial bombardment or overland invasion from neighboring countries . We avoided dogs , lugged large quantities of bottled water everywhere and drank plenty of green tea . We stayed well . <p> And we accepted as great news the words of Fatima  --  a beautiful smiling guide in Bukhara .

The afternoon walk in the forest , seeing how Indians survived in the wilderness , reminded me of my own days at camp , and I looked forward to the evening campfire . Then came the question that told me my husband had slipped over the edge : " How can we get to see the bears ? " <p> I looked at the ranger . He looked at me and sighed . I took my husband by the hand and explained slowly and carefully that here in the wild we did n't want to see the bear face to face . We could visit the bear in the town zoo when we got home . <p> We had dinner in the White Wolf Lodge , the only restaurant in the high country . I pondered the menu , wondering which dinner would be least attractive to the bear , were he to smell it on my breath . My husband and children had no such qualms . They proceeded on the assumption that Sierra black bears were fond only of berries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dinner rolls with honey and jam . <p> My husband even requested honey for his tea . " Honey prevents early-onset arthritis . " Death by bear does too . <p> We attended the White Wolf Lodge campfire . The ranger explained to the assembled campers that this park was the animals ' home . We were visitors , welcome if we did not disturb the animals , lure them by leaving open food or in other ways initiate face-to-face contact . They are very smart animals , he explained , particularly the bears who break into coolers and vans because they know there is food inside . Great . I now knew that the enemy was not only huge , but intelligent as well . I promised not to bother or seduce any animal . We sang some songs and left the campfire . <p> Our tent-cabin boasted a wooden floor and a canvas skin of approximately a quarter inch . Bear-proof , my eye ! Here we were in the middle of the wilderness in a large knapsack with doors . As we walked back to the shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaws . " <p> As I entered the tent-cabin , I wondered if bears preferred Pepsodent to Crest , tartar control or fluoride . Could I skip brushing just this once ? Would my teeth survive the night ? I just hoped the bear did n't like minty fresh breath . <p> I piled 14 blankets on and prayed that the bear would not catch the scent of anything remotely interesting . Drifting off , I wished for only one thing . Unfortunately , drinking water , wine and a pot of coffee at dinner prevented my wish from being granted . In the middle of the night , I was forced to leave the security of my blankets and make tracks for the " facility " across the compound . My chivalrous husband followed with a flashlight . <p> It was a moonlit night . I could see places where the bear had been and avoided them . I held my minty breath and went forward . In order to conserve energy , lights inside the facility had been turned off . Lovely . I could imagine the bear hovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice , clean teeth . <p> There was a loud noise . My heart stopped . Was this it , the end of my sojourn on earth ? No . My husband had dropped the flashlight . I raced across the compound and left him to cope with whatever was out there in the darkness . I reentered my canvas fortress and dove under the 14 blankets . <p> Wildlife abounds in the mountains . And I am comfortable with the species Ursa in the night sky , at the zoo and on the playing field . <p> We bought a bear skin for my husband 's study . I dust around it gently once a week and then back out of the room . So far , so good . <p>  --  Andrea Cohen Greyber <p> Withering Heights <p> " Crook Lodge " sounded like something out of a bad Gene Wilder movie , but there it was in my guide to Britain  --  a typical bed-and-breakfast hotel at the end of a tiny street in the city of York . When I arrived there in late October at 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark and cold in what looked like night but technically was only late afternoon in Yorkshire . <p> But the landlady offered a cheerful welcome and invited me to park my car " at the bottom " of the drive . I 'd been living in England for two months and knew what she meant : to pull all the way to the end so that other guests could park behind me . It 's a common practice in a country where parking is hard to find , and especially in a city like York , where the automobile and the narrow medieval lanes do not mix comfortably . Indeed , even before I could get inside the house with my luggage , another car entered the drive and blocked my vehicle . <p> I had come to Yorkshire to visit Brontem country , particularly the small town of Haworth , about an hour west of York , with its museum in the old Brontem parsonage . I told my landlady that I needed to get on the road by 11 the following morning . <p> " And , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not to worry ! " she said . " No trouble at all . " <p> I spent the next morning , a glorious Yorkshire day , touring York . At 11 a.m. , I returned to the lodge ready to hop into my car for my day trip to Haworth  --  and discovered that I was still blocked by the other vehicle . When I told my landlady , she reacted with dismay . <p> " You mean that is your car ? " she said , pointing to the one trapped at the end of her drive . " I thought it was the other . " <p> And where were the drivers of the other car ? <p> She shrugged . " They 've gone into the town . " She checked their room for car keys without success , then suggested I wait until noon , when they might return . <p> I waited until noon . I waited until 1 p.m . At 1:30 , I suggested that we call a locksmith or a tow truck . The landlady did n't like that idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her car if mine still was n't free when she returned from her afternoon shopping trip . At 2:30 , she was back home , and my car was still barricaded . So she gallantly offered the keys to her new BMW , and I started off to Haworth . <p> Then it began to rain . And five miles down the road , I experienced , in true " Wuthering Heights " fashion , a premonition so vivid that I nearly pulled off the road . I sensed with absolute certainty that , if I drove any farther , I was going to have an accident in this expensive car and that I 'd never get out of York before the insurance was settled . <p> I drove back to the lodge without damaging the car , and spent the rest of the afternoon waiting for the offending couple to appear . I walked over to the railroad museum in York , certain that my car would be free when I returned . It was n't . I wrote postcards . I walked into town again . My car was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pitch dark outside and when everything in Haworth was closed , the couple who had trapped me returned to the lodge . <p> The next morning I got up early and drove to Haworth , arriving around 9 o'clock . <p> The Brontem museum did n't open until 11 . But no matter , said the kind women at the information center . If I was a Brontem fan , I would no doubt enjoy the lovely walk to see the ruins of Top Withens , purported to be the model for Wuthering Heights . <p> It was cold and very windy , but the sun shone bright , so I set out on the five-mile round trip . My parka , which I 'd washed for the trip , kept me warm enough , and it was a stunning walk  --  across the moors , over stiles , beside stone walls . <p> When I was 400 yards from the ruins , the wind blew in a thunderhead that would have made Emily Brontem strain for adjectives , and the rain began to pour . That was when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The rain was gone by the time I reached Top Withens , which was nothing but a ruined foundation on a hillside , so all that remained was for me to walk back , drenched . The wind blew as hard as ever , only now I could feel it more dramatically . The lovely moors had become bogs , and soon I was covered with mud . <p> Well , at least I had the museum to look forward to . By the time I returned from my hike it was 12:30 , well past opening time . Sure enough , when I reached the entrance , I could see plenty of visitors milling around inside . <p> I tried the door . It was locked . <p> A knock produced a very pleasant man who opened the door just enough to allow his head to protrude . " Yes ? " he said . I asked if the museum were open . <p> " Oh , yes , " he said . " It 's open . But you ca n't come in . " He smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door in my face . <p> I retreated 50 yards to a newsstand , where I bought myself a soda and contemplated my options . I would knock again , and if the man refused me entry a second time , I would let him have it , recounting every single incident that had transpired from the moment I 'd pulled into the drive at the inn the day before . <p> Such dire measures turned out not to be necessary . I got into the museum at last , and spent a good amount of time looking around the collection . <p> But I ca n't remember a single thing I saw . <p>  --  W. Edward Blain <p> Honeymoon Hotel <p> " Leave it all to me , " I told my fiance when it came time to plan our honeymoon . I considered myself the traveler in this family-to-be , with trips to Nepal , several Caribbean islands and the Middle East to my credit . John 's idea of a vacation was a week at a cottage in the country . I resolved to introduce him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start than on our honeymoon ? <p> John was skeptical . He asked , " Why do n't we just check into a hotel right here at home ? " But I regaled him with stories about the charming , out-of-the-way hotels I 'd found on past trips and impressed him with tales about the travel dollars I 'd stretched . <p> Begrudgingly , John agreed to leave the planning to me . " But find someplace nice , " he said . " It 's our honeymoon . " <p> " Of course , " I said , already happily surrounded by brochures and guidebooks . <p> Picking a general destination was easy . The wedding was in January , and neither of us ski . It was n't a time to sightsee or take on any hard traveling . It was a time for the beach . <p> " Where can we go in the Caribbean ? " I asked several travel agents . <p> I had stipulations . I was a traveler ; I wanted no mass-market honeymoon , no high-rise hotels or gambling havens , no cruises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no swarms of American tourists . I wanted off-the-beaten-track . Someplace pretty and a little exotic . <p> I finally decided on Grenada because a yachtsman I 'd met in my travels had told me it was the prettiest island in the Caribbean . I presented the choice to John with a flourish , and we sorted through brochures . " How about this hotel ? " he asked , picking up a flier from a large chain . " There 's no point to traveling if you stay in a place you could stay in at home , " I argued . " Looks pretty good to me , " he said . " But do what you want . Just find someplace nice . It 's our honeymoon . " <p> I drew up a list of hotels , then hit the guidebooks . I knew exactly what I wanted : a place that was small and had a foreign flavor , ocean views , bougainvillea and the nightly rate of a Motel 6 . <p> I settled on a place that promised ocean views and a terrace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm . " This place is small and out-of-the-way . And it has a sort of foreign flavor . Trust me . " <p> A few weeks later , still picking the rice out of our hair , John and I were snuggled in the back of a taxi , careering along twisted Grenadian roads . Our driver kept one hand on his horn to warn goats and motorists of our approach , and we whizzed past pastel-colored houses , shacks and tiny roadside stores all decorated with flamboyant splashes of hibiscus and bougainvillea . <p> The driver turned down a road bordered by a dull brown field . A few thin cows nibbled on the parched grass . A sign told us that a sewage treatment plant was under construction , but the heavy equipment surrounding it was idle . There was n't a flowering bush in sight . <p> To my horror , the driver pulled into a driveway across from the field . Three squat buildings perched one above the other on the side of a steep hill . <p> John and I stumbled out of the cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside and up the hill , ignoring our luggage . <p> We trudged along , bags slung over both shoulders . " Well , it definitely has a foreign feel , " John said . <p> In a building at the top of the hill , the youth slid open a glass door and waved us in . There was a bed covered by a spread the color of canned pea soup , a built-in table and one straight-backed chair . <p> He pointed to a small refrigerator . " Your kitchen . The stove is broken . Maybe we 'll fix it tomorrow . " <p> I slid open the glass door and stepped out onto our " terrace , " the cement threshold . The ocean was nowhere to be seen . Our view was of the hotel 's fuel tanks and the prickly field across the street . <p> I came back into the room and sat down on the bed . I imagined a week in this room , one straight-backed chair between us . Unable to move , I started to cry . <p> John put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey , " he said . " We 're getting out of here . " <p> " We ca n't ! " I wailed . " We 've already paid for the room . " <p> " I do n't care , " he said . " It 's our honeymoon . " <p> He took my hand and led me to a taxi that sped us away and deposited us in front of a graceful building set in the midst of a tropical garden  --  the chain hotel . John conferred with the clerk at the reception desk . <p> " I understand you 're on your honeymoon , " she said to me . " We 've arranged an ocean-front room . No extra charge . " <p> A bellboy escorted us to a spacious room with a king-size bed , overstuffed chairs and a balcony overlooking the sea . We stood at the railing and watched the waves curl into the shore . <p>  --  Fredda Rosen <p> The Orient Distress <p> " Visa ? You do n't need a visa for Bulgaria , do you ?

" I said even more plaintively . <p> " No visa , no Bulgaria , " he repeated . <p> I changed tactics . " I 've got plenty of money ... " <p> " Sorry . " This cog in the great gears of the Soviet was not to be swayed . <p> Moments later we stood on a small station platform somewhere inside Bulgaria , the train lurching toward Istanbul without us . Two feet of snow covered the ground ; there was not another person in sight . Pointing to the dingy station house , the cog said , " Tonight you will stay there . Tomorrow , back to Yugoslavia . " <p> " But our passports ... ? " <p> He waved his hand dismissively and trudged into the night . <p> It was December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The famous Orient Express was defunct , but trains still plied the route to Istanbul . And so , smitten by images of Agatha Christie and romantic railway carriages , we bought tickets . <p> The first 24 hours , from Venice to Belgrade , were unremarkable . We crossed the border without mishap , purchasing visas from the customs agents as our guidebook recommended . The train slowly bumped and screeched through the night , while we huddled warmly in our sleeping bags , undisturbed in our compartment . The next morning we arrived in Belgrade , there to change trains to Istanbul . <p> Fog engulfed the frigid station . Patches of ice congealed on the platforms , and the sullen crowds seemed to be having a spitting contest , so universally were people hawking onto the ground . No one spoke English , and we could n't find the right platform , much less the right train . And then a man leaning out a train window ( he must have overheard us talking ) shouted " Istanbul ! Istanbul ! " and beckoned us with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . " Istanbul , Istanbul ! " the man shouted . We jumped on the moving train . It picked up speed . Then the man approached , laughing hysterically , tears dripping from his eyes . " Munchen . Munchen . Ha , ha , ha , ha ! " We had jumped on the train to Munich . <p> For an hour we rolled through a bleak landscape of snow-covered fields of broken corn stalks and big , black crows . Finally the train stopped in Ruma , at an unheated concrete train station that belonged in the Twilight Zone . When a train going to Belgrade finally arrived , it was an old bus mounted on train wheels . It took all afternoon to reach Belgrade . <p> We did , of course , find the train to Istanbul . We did not jump on ; we squeezed . There must have been 5,000 people packed into a space for 500 . We could n't even move through the hallways . The train was unheated , and every person was drunk . For six hours we stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until we discovered that only the very last car was going all the way to Istanbul . And any moment , we were warned , that car might separate from the train . <p> We pushed , and squeezed , and cursed , and desperately fought our way to the rear car , a car that made the rest of the train seem first-class . Stinking of salami , liquor and sweat , of humanity as raw as I 'd ever experienced , a man lay unconscious in a pool of liquid . Another man , also unconscious , had slipped so far forward that his forehead rested on the filthy floor . The others , drunk and wrapped in layers of soiled clothes , sang loudly , stomped their feet and tossed empty bottles into the hall . And through it all walked the conductor , spitting in his hands and wiping them on the curtains . <p> Near midnight , the train stopped , and the men  --  workers returning home from some far-away labor project , we later learned  --  stumbled off . We were in Nis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the train , at last , was empty . <p> Exhausted  --  we had now been on our feet for 15 hours  --  we flopped into a seat and fell asleep .

Welcome to Bulgaria . <p> In a corner of the one-room station , two Turks and a Romanian sat huddled around a small coal stove . They too were without visas . I leaned my pack in a corner , pulled out my sleeping bag and fell asleep on a bench . <p> Bright lights and loud voices awakened me . The room fell silent as I sat up . In one corner of the room stood about 25 peasants with rough burlap sacks and ragged clothes . " Hi , " I said , waving . No one returned my greeting .

" <p> Spent from our ordeal , we decided not to go back to Belgrade and apply for Bulgarian visas , but to head south , to the warm Greek isles instead . We settled into our seats and rejoiced at our freedom , and our free ride . <p> An hour later we crossed back into Yugoslavia , and a conductor demanded our tickets . But the Bulgarians told us it would be free , I protested . The conductor spit on the floor .

My mission : to purchase a ticket for the 50-hour journey from Kunming , in southeast China , to Guangzhou . <p> The sign outside window No. 2 says in Chinese that train tickets for travel two days hence will be sold at 8:30 a.m . Another note says that all tickets for all trains are sold out for the next two days . What to do ? <p> Train tickets are never for sale in China more than two days in advance . Furthermore , foreigners have only an outside shot at getting any tickets at all at the train station , because we are supposed to go to the official travel agency to make purchases . In this city , though , the official travel agency sells only plane tickets . Consequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country with as many rules and regulations as China , I am determined to beat the system by creating my own rules , if necessary  --  or at least by bending the existing ones . I have one big advantage over many of my fellow tourists  --  I speak decent Chinese . <p> All Chinese have identity cards that they must present in order to purchase train tickets . Without a special foreign student ID card , foreigners must pay more for tickets . So now , in the Kunming train station , I hop to the front of the line to see if there are any students in a position to barter  --  a free English lesson , perhaps , for a ticket ? No , these are pros and they are cornering the market . By my calculations , there are at least 200 hard berths available on the train to Guangzhou , yet only 21 are for sale . <p> The first person in line is taking " orders " from latecomers and she has a lot of information on that pad of hers , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line between us , and that means the numbers are against me . <p> A security man appears from the shadows and the crowd at the front of the line rapidly disperses . Next , a train station attendant makes her way through the line , checking IDs and counting purchasers . " Will one be available for me ? " I ask . " I 've been here since 5:30 and it does n't even open for another 90 minutes . " <p> " Guangzhou tickets are gone , " she replies abruptly . <p> " Can you help me out ? I am a foreigner and do n't understand the system here . " This appeal to sympathy is a last resort , but there 's a slight chance it will work . <p> " No , " she says . " Come this afternoon to queue for tickets sold tomorrow morning . " <p> By now it 's 7:45 . My patience is dwindling , and my Chinese is evaporating with my frustration . <p> Suddenly , a flash flood of people streams toward a window on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open . Hundreds of hands clutching Chinese currency converge on the ticket agent . Back at my window , it is now my turn . <p> " Pardon me , I know tickets are not sold here at this window , but I need to get to Guangzhou . Can you help me ? I 'm a student here , but I lost my student ID card , " I say . " <p> " To Guangzhou , you say ? " The attendant is a young woman , probably a student . <p> " Very well , " she says as she examines my papers . " I 'll sell you one ticket , hard-sleeper , leaving this afternoon . " <p> My heart thumps , my fears evaporate and I approach paradise . I have purchased a train ticket in China . <p>  --  Jeff Brauer <p> Belize It or Not ! <p> The brochure promised " a tropical adventure , " and despite what other survivors of my travel party might say , it would be an injustice to describe it as anything less . <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stolen luggage , the evening we spent hopelessly stranded in deep jungle , the attack of the panthers . Then there were the razor-sharp coral beaches , the rain and the resident mosquito populations that thrive on repellent . And who can forget our star-crossed hotel , with its tenant reptiles and toxic meals ? <p> The climate did n't help . Bathed in a fireball sunset , an iridescent green tropical haze rose off the jungle as our flight bounced in . Night was obscenely brief and the sun returned early , bleaching skies and boiling rivers . It was n't just hot . By mid-morning , breathing demanded voluntary function . <p> Although we did n't know it when we awoke that first blazing morning , it was Belize Independence Day , an important anniversary in Central America 's tiniest democracy . After learning that every local currency exchange was officially closed , we complained , drank warm beers and took a siesta . <p> Later that evening , we watched from our hotel balcony as a pageant of flames and shadows converged on the city 's open-air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lit by bonfires , on surrounding hillsides . <p> Once the ceremonies began , a public address system blared forth the national anthem . Among the assembled thousands , few demonstrated familiarity with its lyrics . <p> Fewer still joined in the following round of " God Save the Queen . " After these choice choruses , though , a third arose spontaneously from the hillsides  --  a strangely familiar country tune . Could it be ... yes , it was that old favorite , " El Paso . " You 'll never fully appreciate patriotic fervor until you 've heard a chorus of thousands singing , " Out in the West Texas town of El Paso , I fell in love with a Mexican girl ... " <p> As 10,000 voices sang the refrain , " Ai , yi , yi , yiiiiii ! " to the tropical stars of a September night , I reflected on independence days , and patriotism . <p> I ca n't explain what makes one population 's patriotic song popular in the hearts and charts of another . Few , I believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " certainly . " Waltzing Matilda . " And definitely " El Paso . " <p>  --  Peter Mikelbank <p> Airport Angst <p> Crossing the jungles of Africa or the plains of Mongolia has always been easy for me . Eating exotic foods , making myself understood when I do n't speak the language , negotiating my way through unfamiliar territory  --  all aspects of travel are exhilarating . It 's trying to get home from the airport that 's tough . <p> Last year  --  over the objections of friends and relatives  --  I went to Cuba . " It 's too dangerous , " said one concerned friend . " What will you eat ? " said another , familiar with the food shortages . But I went ahead , had a terrific time , flew back from Havana to Florida  --  and sat at Miami Airport . For 10 hours . There had been a snowstorm in New York , and both Kennedy and LaGuardia airports were shut down . Finally , after midnight , we flew to LaGuardia , where I discovered  --  at 2:30 a.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounded and cabs were spotted as frequently as J.D. Salinger . But I finally corraled one , headed out at a snail 's pace , reached my Long Island home by 4 a.m. , showered , slept two hours and at 7:15 a.m. staggered off to my job . <p> Leaving for trips , I used to let my family drive me to the airport . But there was always a big scene : Mom hugging me tight , Dad surreptitiously stuffing a few extra bills into my pocket , my sisters fighting back tears . <p> Now , things are easier . I take the Long Island Railroad to Jamaica , where I catch a bus to the airport . Returning home , I reverse the order . Very simple , inexpensive , no big deal  --  usually ... <p> This year I went to Vietnam . Again , some of my friends and family did n't think it was a good idea . " You 'll get malaria , " said one . " What happens if you get into trouble ? " Indeed , Vietnam was a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to expect . But I went ahead and had a terrific time . <p> On a Monday morning , I flew from Bangkok to Taipei , to San Francisco to New York  --  a trip taking nearly 27 hours . After arriving in San Francisco , I noticed a United Airlines flight leaving an hour earlier than the one I was scheduled on . I switched flights and got home early . <p> I walked into my house at 8:30 p.m. and called my parents . No answer . That 's nice , I thought . They 're out for the evening . Then it hit me : Where are they out for the evening ? <p> I called their neighbor , and sure enough , they had gone to the airport . Oh , great . My parents have n't picked me up at the airport since the Carter administration . I 'm thinking : The plane will come in , there will be no Saul , and Mom will be upset . So , here I am at home , sitting by the phone , worrying about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hepatitis and taking 27 hours to get home . Finally , they called . <p> Traveling would be so nice if I could just avoid airports . <p>  --  Saul Schachter
