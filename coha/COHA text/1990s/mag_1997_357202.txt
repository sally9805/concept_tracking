So I 'm sitting in the office minding my own business when this E-mail pops up from some guy named Denny Reikert . " The following accounts have reference numbers way out of sequence , " his note says . " Do these need to be updated in some way ? " Then he lists them : Warren Road , Rexx , the Ogden Group , Ladybell Textiles . <P> Rexx ? Ogden ? Ladybell ? I do n't know what this character is talking about , and I 've never heard of his outfit , the Dysson Foundation . I E-mail him back to say just that . His quick response : Oops . Could I delete the errant message ? <P> Then another E-mail arrives , this one from Vicky DeBice , Dysson 's director of human resources . " Yesterday you mistakenly received E-mail from one of our employees ... I would like to assure you that Dysson does not buy or sell electronic address lists . " <P> No sooner has this crossed my screen than Reikert writes again , asking me to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to sound like a weirdo , " he says . " I 'm just trying to prove certain discrepancies , and I seem to have been locked out of my computer . " <P> Already I can smell trouble . Then the second E-mail arrives from DeBice . " For reasons yet to be understood , " she says , " you received messages from one of our members , Denny Reikert . Denny Reikert was found dead yesterday afternoon ... " <P> Now all hell breaks loose . In rapid order I hear from Mendiero Barrett , Dysson 's V.P. of Pan-Pacific Integration ( " Dysson is currently conducting a private inquiry into the suicide of Denny Reikert ... " ) and from a recruiter who offers me , of all things , a job at Dysson and guides me to its Website
