' Dynamic scoring ' sounds like something composers or quarterbacks do . But in fact it 's the hottest buzz word from the realm of Republican legislators , who hope to use the economic technique to justify tax cuts . Already the term has ignited a controversy . Laura D'Andrea Tyson , the President 's chief economist , calls the concept " dangerous . " But Republican John Kasich of Ohio , who is expected to head the House Budget Committee in the new Congress , is just as strongly in favor of the idea . <P> Scoring is a Washington term for estimating the impact of changes in tax and spending policy on federal revenue . Traditionally , economists and estimators use " static scoring , " in which a cut or increase in taxes is presumed to have a directly proportional effect on revenues . In other words , if taxes are cut 10% , revenues fall 10% . Thus fiscal responsibility demands that tax cuts be paired with matching cuts in spending . <P> The dynamic-scoring models hold that a 10% tax cut may boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and businesses , which affects not only their own behavior but the performance of the economy as well . Increased economic activity means that the government 's incoming revenues might actually be enhanced by tax cuts . Thus , using the dynamic- scoring model , tax cuts do n't always require matching spending cuts . <P> Liberals charge that dynamic scoring is a latter-day version of Reagan-era voodoo economics , a way of slashing taxes without making painful budget cuts . Says Tyson : " We have just gained , after more than a decade , some credibility with financial markets through the hard-won credibility and sanity of our fiscal policy . This is not the moment to change . " But Republicans argue that they have an example of how dynamic scoring could have predicted failure : the luxury tax of 1990 , which produced disappointing revenues because it crushed the boat industry .
