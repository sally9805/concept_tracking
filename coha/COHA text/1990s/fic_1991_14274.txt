VITA sits in her narrow bed , newspapers strewn around her , watching PITO playing handball against the stone of a building . VITA Pito was better than me at everything  --  stickball , kick the can , Johnny-on-the-rope , capsHe had an incredible arm . I tried not to feel too bad  --  I mean , he was a boy and boys are supposed to be better at things like that . Ma said that I should be proud I could n't keep up with Pitobecause he was n't human . She thought this because of how he called me . He never used my name . He 'd just put his fingers to his mouth and blow . Pito had the loudest whistle on the block . Ma used to say he could call Satan with that whistleI always came running when I heard that sound . ( PITO whistles . ) Coming , General . ( Gathering up several sorry-looking dolls from under her bed and running over to PITO . ) Are these okay ? PITO Good enough , Sargeant . Good enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a fence , head up . ) VITA I like the doing the blondes the best  --  PITO Uh huh . Ready ? VITA Sure . PITO Do it ! ( VITA takes a stick and decapitates all the blonde dolls . ) Good one , Sargeant Vita . Very good . p. 3 VITA The only problem with this game is that you run out of good victims . PITO Yeah , I know . It 's fun for a while though . VITA I 'll tell Ma I played with you today and then she 'll get me more dolls . She hates me to play with you . PITO She just do n't understand what we 're trying to do , Vita . Sometimes people jus'do n't understand You got ta be bigger than them  --  smarter . Get what you need and get out . VITA Damn you 're smart . PITO YeahI know . When I go into the army I 'm going straight to intelligence . People like me  --  we 're wasted anyplace else . You know what ? After we knock off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VITA You mean like put cherry bombs in their heads ? PITO Yeah ! VITA Snap ! That would be fah-unn , Pito ! PITO Tell me about it ! VITA Why do n't you let me call you your real name ? Ma said that 's another reason you ai n't human  --  because you ai n't got a real name . PITO Pito 's as real as you can get . It 's my trademark , man . Tell her that . And listen , stop listening to her , okay ? It 's getting on my nerves . p. 4 VITA Okay PITO Do n't look at me like that . VITA Like what ? PITO Like you want to cry at me . VITA I don'wanna cry at you I just  --  I wan na know it . I wan na know your real name . Your Ma couldn'ta woken up and said I wan na call my boy " whistle " . You 've got ta have a real name . PITO It do n't matter . What 's real do n't matter , Vita . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing . VITA I ca n't marry you unless you got a real name . PITO God will marry us no matter what name we use . Anyway , when I 'm an intelligence officer , I 'll have to go by a code name  --  How do you think I should dress ? Like James Bond or like the Saint ? VITA You know what ? I do n't think they let Puerto Ricans be intelligence officers because think about itThey always have those British accents  --  PITO Not Man From U.N.C.L.E . VITA Yeah , but they talked kinda funny though . You do n't talk funny enoughI guess you 'll have to stay here with me. p. 5 PITO I 'll come backand bring you some real heads . You 'd like that would n't you ? VITA MaybeYeahI guess so . They probably would n't explode as good as my dolls though . PITO I bet you 're right . ( VITA touches his lips with her fingers . ) Hey ! VITA Sorry . You just  --  they looked like they was bleeding for a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess ( Takes out a cherry bomb or fire crackers and divides them up with VITA ) You do those and I 'll take theseokay Sargeant ? VITA You got it , General . ( PITO lights his . There 's a flash of light . VITA continues to speak . ) I really shoulda kissed him . I wanted toall the time . He had the reddest lips I ever seen on a guy . Like a flower  --  sweet-smelling and soft . When I pull up my sheets to my nose I think I smell him there even though he never came to me . I smell him in the warmth there . I smell him in my dreams . In my dreams , he wears a suit and he comes to Ma and asks her if he can marry me . She says no , but he keeps coming back . He comes back twenty-one times for every year he walked the Earth . And finally , Ma says okay , but he has to wait twenty-one days before he can have me , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass of water to get Ma out of the room and then he takes me on my mother 's red rug and we stay together for the rest of our lives and even Ma begins to like him . But something happens at the end of that dreamI try to wake myself up , but I never can . That 's when I see him in that last minute  --  that last moment when the world stopped for him . When his head was the one that exploded ( VITA watches the child-PITO tell of his death. ) p. 6 PITO I heard a long , sharp sound  --  like a knife cutting straight through my heart . That sound filled my mouth . It was the sound of my heart exploding . My blood filling my mouth . I became a waterfall . I became liquid . And in my eyes , I saw a kiss that never left my lips  --  a kiss that was covered in organ meat . My lungs and my heart resting on my face . The force of them pushing my eyes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what that sound was that was so much inside me now  --  it was my whistle , my call to God , to somebodyI did n't want to taste my own bloodI did n't know the taste of my blood was like fear . But my sound was a warning . I guess that 's how you know you 're dead  --  when your own sound becomes the only thing you hear . VITA When I was seven , Pito Vasquez accidentally put a piece of rusted antenna in my ear . We were playing Johnny on the Rope  --  but instead of rope , Pito pulled an antenna off a junked-up car . I thought I would die , it hurt so much and I could hardly hear outta that ear any more . Only certain sounds were clearlike Pito 's pito . But I healed real well and real fast  --  for a girl , that 's what Pito told me . He told me I would be rewarded for my bravery . ( Pause )              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
