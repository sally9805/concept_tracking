<p> As a scientist , one of Steven Wolf 's favorite questions to ask participants at the end of a study is : " What can you do now that you could n't do before ? " <p> One of the best answers he 's ever received came from an 86-year-old man who learned the ancient Chinese martial art form t'ai chi as part of Woif 's study of how exercise can help seniors prevent falls . <p> " The man smiled at me , then lifted up one foot , bent over , and took off his loafer while balancing on his other leg , " recalls Wolf , a professor and director of research in the department of rehabilitation medicine at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta . " Then , still balancing on one leg , the 86-year-old gentleman stood back up , bent over again , and put his loafer back on . What impressed me the most was that he could n't do this before studying t'ai chi . " <p> Although many people assume that balance and mobility problems are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that exercise can help improve agility and strength in elderly individuals and reduce their likelihood of falling . In Wolf 's study , published in the May 1996 Journal of the American Gerontological Society , 215 seniors ages 70 to 96 were divided into three groups . One group performed balance exercises on a computerized platform once a week ; one group took a weekly t'ai chi class ; and a control group met for a weekly discussion . After 15 weeks , " the t'ai chi group did the best , by delaying the onset of first or multiple falls by 47 percent , " Wolf said . <p> In addition , the t'ai chi group also showed significant improvement in cardiovascular profile and quality-of-life measurements , such as a reduced fear of falling and an increased sense of control over their lives . " T'ai chi has been used in China as an exercise for older individuals for three centuries and as a martial art for 2,000 years , " Wolf says . " The movements are very slow and deliberate and involve a great deal of trunk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these movements is like learning strategies you can use to abort falls . " <p> T'ai chi is just one form of exercise studied for its fall-preventing capability as part of a recently completed six-year project by the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute for Nursing Research . More than 1,500 seniors at seven sites around the country participated in the trials , called FICSIT for Frailty and Injuries : Cooperative Studies of intervention Techniques . " The FICSIT studies showed that even a low level of exercise can reduce the risk of falls , " notes Washington University ( St. Louis ) bio-statistician Michael Province , whose analysis of the FICSIT data on exercise and fall prevention appeared last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association . " Exercise can help older adults improve strength , endurance , flexibility , and balance ; improvements in one domain often carry over into another . " <p> In general , " the evidence is mounting that the more older people can do in terms of exercise , the better off they are  --  with two main caveats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to check with a doctor to make sure any new exercise program is safe and appropriate . Second , seniors should start under the guidance of a qualified instructor or physical therapist to make sure they 're doing exercises properly and not doing too much , too soon  --  especially if they 've been sedentary . <p> " The problem is that to improve balance , you 've got to challenge balance , which is inherently risky , " says Mary E. Tinetti , chief of geriatrics at Yale University School of Medicine , who studied 301 men and women age 70 and older with at least one risk factor for falling  --  such as muscle weakness or use of sedatives . To reduce these seniors ' risk of falling , Tinetti used multiple interventions , including having a physical therapist go to a participant 's home and teach balance exercises . " The physical therapist was n't necessarily there with them every time they did the exercise , " Tinetti notes . <p> " But the therapist did an assessment , then gave people exercises that matched their fitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we trained balance was to start with a simple exercise people could do by holding onto their kitchensink with two hands , then going up on their toes , then on their heels , then walking sideways . As they gained proficiency , people did the exercises holding on by just one hand , then one finger , then not holding on at all . " <p> Tinetti 's study also involved other fall-reduction strategies , such as adjusting medications and making the environment safer . The overall program reduced the rate of falling by 40 percent . " It 's impossible to say how much of this was due to exercise , " she notes , " but my guess ' is that exercise had the major impact of all the interventions . " <p> The message , she says , " is that balance is very trainable , even in older people . " While balance exercises have been used for years to help people recover from trauma such as stroke , she says , " What 's new is that these exercises can be very effective in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> ILLUSTRATION : Balancing on one leg , he stood up , bent over , and put his loafer back on  --  something he could n't do before studying t'ai chi . <p> By Carol Krucoff <p>
