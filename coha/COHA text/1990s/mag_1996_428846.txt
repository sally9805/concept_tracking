CASSIOPEIA is the only queen in heaven cataloged among the official constellations that partition the sky into 88 sovereign domains . According to the oldest Greek star lore , she is the Queen of Ethiopia transfigured into stars . Her majesty , however , was minimized by Aratus of Soli . The Phaenomena , his astronomical poem composed in the third century B.C. , informs us her stars are " scanty . " In the story of Perseus and Andromeda , Cassiopeia 's high-and-mighty vanity prompted the god Poseidon to assign a sea monster to help her cultivate some dynastic discretion and royal remorse . You can judge Cassiopeia 's celestial regality for yourself by locating the distinctive W her stars always assume . She is above the northeast horizon on August 's all-sky map on pages 62 and 63 , and from most northern latitudes Cassiopeia is circumpolar . Seatbelted to her throne , she turns head over heels every time she completes another lap through the skies . Sometimes known as the " Lady of the Chair , " her ability to hang on to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like scepters and crowns , are emblems of a monarch 's rank . Most portraits of Cassiopeia , however , leave her crownless . Soaring upside down could induce a crown to slip from her brow , and when we comb the starry night we actually encounter a loose one - Corona Borealis , the Northern Crown - hanging between Hercules , the Strongman , and Bootes , the Herdsman . Hercules kneels at the meridian , the blue vertical line that stands like a scepter connecting the map 's south and north horizons . The Crown is a little farther west , not far from the zenith . Heaven is crowned like royalty as Corona Borealis glides overhead on these August nights . It is an incomplete circlet of stars , but its resemblance to a crown was recognized by the ancient Greeks . In the second century A.D. , the Alexandrian astronomer Ptolemy included it in his list of 48 constellations . About four centuries earlier , the heavenly Crown earned a passage in the Phaenomena , and the oldest surviving collection of ancient Greek constellation myths - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiquity . Commentaries on the Crown by other ancient authors reveal some confusion about its character . In some accounts it 's a traditional diadem cast in gold and encrusted with jewels . Other sources , however , regarded it as a wreath . The Leiden Aratea , a ninth-century manuscript with illustrations of constellation figures , portrays Corona Borealis as a leafy garland with a few dangling ribbons . However the Northern Crown was contrived , both the Phaenomena and the Katasterismoi insist it belongs to someone other than Cassiopeia. // Cassiopeia , queen of the Ethiopians , sails through the northern sky on her throne . Circumpolar from most northern latitudes , the constellation is best known for its W of stars . From Johannes Hevelius 's Star Atlas of 1690. // According to Aratus , the Northern Crown was launched by the god Dionysus up to its lofty berth to honor Ariadne . She had helped Theseus , the hero prince of Athens , to escape the Labyrinth of Crete 's King Minos after he killed the Minotaur . Ariadne had persuaded Theseus to carry her back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the island of Naxos . The ancient authorities differ on his motivation . Some say he cynically abandoned her once he was safely clear of Crete . Others imply that Dionysus had already claimed her for himself . Various versions of the story also account for Ariadne 's crown in different ways . Although the Katasterismoi endorses the crown 's placement in the heavens by Dionysus at his wedding with Ariadne , it also indicates the crown was first presented to Ariadne by Theseus , who turned her head with promises of a kind heart and a coronet . In the story of the Labyrinth and the Minotaur , Theseus and 13 other Athenian youths were delivered as sacrificial tribute to King Minos , an obligation Athens had to fulfill every eight years . Incorporating the symbolism of calendrical renewal , this interval corresponds to the octaeteris , a cycle that matched eight solar , or tropical , years with 99 lunar months to bring the phase of the Moon back into congruence with the seasons . Ritual nuptials between the king and his consort at this time mimicked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sacrificial deaths that accompanied these fertility rites were also part of the rhythm of renewal . Through the seasonal deaths of wild and cultivated plants , the inevitable replacement of generations , and the passage of cyclical , celestial time , the world was regenerated . In the Poetica Astronomica , the Latin poet Hyginus offered a Roman perspective on Corona Borealis . According to Hyginus , when Ariadne married Liber Pater ( the Italic equivalent of Dionysus ) , she received the crown as a wedding gift from Venus and the Hours . Despite their name , the Hours ( or Horae ) were actually nymphs of the seasons . Like Dionysus , Father Liber sponsored a cult of divine inspiration and mystic intoxication . Although he came to be identified most closely with freely flowing wine and Xrated rites of renewal , he embodied the enduring spirit of life . Like a seasonal vegetation god , he annually fell dormant , only later to be revived . The ancient authorities , then , attributed Corona Borealis to Ariadne , but why would the old Mediterranean skywatchers single her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Minos , she was a princess of Crete and probably eligible to wear one , but the tradition is still a little puzzling . So let 's take a closer look at prehistoric Crete . Knossos and the other great palaces of Bronze Age Crete had been destroyed more than once - principally by earthquakes and perhaps by volcanic eruptions as well . For all practical purposes , Minoan civilization ended around 1450 B.C. , long before our earliest sources of Greek sky lore had anything to say about Ariadne . Her myth , however , seems to preserve a memory of Crete 's domination of the Aegean world . Minoan ruins have n't relinquished any images of crowned kings presiding over the renewal rituals , but Crete has given us a pair of ceramic female figures thought to portray a priestess or goddess . Each wears an elaborate headdress that could be regarded as a crown . They hold serpents that probably symbolize the Earth and renewal . Most scholars recognize in these effigies the attributes of the Great Mother goddess who once contained the world 's capacity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth , seasons , Moon , and stars through the cyclical renewal of nature . Almost every ancient society saw her in the seasonal transformation of vegetation , and with symbols of birth , death , and rebirth , she was also , in time , affiliated with the transformation of the soul . The Northern Crown 's seasonal significance was specifically mentioned by the poet Virgil , who advised waiting until " Ariadne 's shining Coronet " set at dawn before planting . Now Ariadne , we recall , became the wife of a god . The root of her name means " holy " and " pure , " and it is also related to a name used for the supernatural Queen of the Underworld . Ariadne is much more than a jilted princess . She is like those crowned female figures from Knossos  --  another incarnation of the Great Mother . Like Persephone , she is the young goddess bride who emerges in one season like the sprouting grain and later ensures new life through her sacrifice at the harvest . Her divinity , evident in her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is advertised by her starry crown . As the paganism of Late Antiquity was displaced by Christianity , many prerogatives of Great Mother goddesses like Isis , Cybele , Demeter , and Diana of Ephesus were conferred on the Virgin Mary . In Roman Catholic doctrine she became Queen of Heaven when she ascended for her celestial Assumption . She is imperially enthroned in the churches of Rome as early as the fifth century , and the celestial imagery that often accompanies her includes the crescent Moon , a sky-blue robe sometimes blazing with stars , and a crown of stars upon her head . Scenes depicting her coronation appear later and treat her as the bride of Christ . In this guise she represents the Church , and the symbols of celestial transcendence are also emblems of power on Earth . // Corona Borealis is a canonical crown in Elijah H. Burritt 's Atlas Designed to Illustrate the Geography of the Heavens , New Edition , 1835 . Griffith Observatory collection . // Corona Borealis has been depicted in many forms throughout history . In the Leiden Aratea it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ der Rijksuniversiteit te Leiden and Griffith Observatory . // The liturgical calendar ties Mary 's Assumption to the season of harvest , when all of nature is ripe and at the end of a cycle . The feast of the Assumption , on August 15th , celebrates her triumph as the crown of Ariadne , one of her pagan predecessors , flies past the top of the sky . Ariadne may have suffered when she was abandoned by Theseus , but as a goddess of cyclic renewal she kept the ancient world humming through her sorrows and her effort on behalf of life on Earth . While Cassiopeia 's highhanded manners put her royal family in jeopardy , Ariadne earned stars for her crown in heaven . <p>
