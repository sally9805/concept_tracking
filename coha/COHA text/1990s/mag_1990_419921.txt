In wilderness lies a genetic bank account we have been drawing on for generations ; only now are we trying to find out what 's left . <p> As we reach down to examine the deep red fruit , the smell of wild strawberries is ridiculously fragrant . In the heat of a July afternoon , the sugars in the fruit seem to cook , smelling like cotton candy at a fairground . The strawberry perfume , hanging in the air , says to birds , bears , and humans alike : pick me , enjoy me , and then spread my seed . We do . After a pleasant morning hike , the wild strawberries taste as good as they look and smell . Sweet and nutritious , they thrive along the trails and sunlit openings of Chippewa National Forest in northern Minnesota . But we are only eating a few of them . We are here to bag samples  --  a few dozen fruits , ten or fifteen tiny seeds per fruit  --  for genetic evaluation and breeding , mostly for qualities we ca n't immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can survive 40 below zero winters , " says my guide for the day , Professor James J. Luby from the University of Minnesota . " This particular variety seems to bloom and set fruit late  --  an advantage for northern growers . It may be resistant to fungal leaf diseases and root rot that afflict commercial strawberries everywhere . But they also have some powerful aromatic compounds that the California industry is paying us to look at . " <p> As a plant breeder , Luby seeks out the genetic diversity of the small fruit crops native to the United States . At the same time that many of the world 's crop varieties have become vulnerable from decades of inbreeding , the characteristics of related wild plants are becoming more and more valuable . Through crossbreeding , Luby and other U.S.crop scientists are expanding the potential of crops like strawberries , transferring to the commercial crop important characteristics found only in plants that must compete and survive in the wild . In the 1960s , California breeders launched a commercial strawberry with genes from a wild variety found growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to flower and set fruit year-round  --  a distinct commercial advantage that has led to a record U.S. strawberry production valued in 1986 at more than $500 million . But most of the breeding and collecting work using wild native fruits belongs only to the recent past and present . Minnesota breeders have developed hardy low-bush blueberries for the North while Florida breeders have created a heat-tolerant blueberry from wild rabbit-eye blueberries of the South . And there are dozens more new varieties of various native fruits in progress . <p> " The North woods are an extremely productive place for small wild fruits , " says Luby . On a half-day exploration in Chippewa National Forest alone , we collected samples of perhaps a dozen species of strawberries , blueberries , raspberries , blackberries , Saskatoon or service-berries , and cranberries . We also saw a wild hazelnut that has disease resistance sought by nut growers in Oregon . The nuts were green and Luby noted the spot for later collection . On another day we might also have found wild currants and grapes , the latter growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over most of the past decade , participating in plant explorations sponsored by the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA/ARS ) , Luby and his colleagues have followed all manner of trails , hiked mountains and stamped through bogs , and spent days at a time wearing mosquito headgear . He has collected wild fruit material , or germplasm , in a dozen northern and western states . Back at the University of Minnesota 's Department of Horticultural Science and Landscape Architecture , he prepares the seeds and clones , then sets them out in plots where he can study them under uniform conditions and monitor their response to disease , heat , cold , drought , wind , insects , and other environmental stresses . <p> The best material will be used to develop new varieties  --  a process that sometimes takes ten to fifteen years . It will also be sent to the USDA 's National Clonal Germplasm Repository in Corvallis , Oregon , to be available to crop scientists and plant breeders from around the world . " But you can never save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks , " says Luby . " Much of the good stuff remains out there in extraordinary diversity , still evolving . It 's a tremendous resource . " <p> The wild relatives of strawberries and the other fruits that we collected happen to occur along the North Country National Scenic Trail , part of the National Trails System , which cuts across Chippewa National Forest . The 662,730-acre Chippewa National Forest is administered by the U.S. Forest Service . The trail provides a sunny corridor through the jack pine woodland , which , depending on when it was last cut , includes aspen , birch and maple along with the pine  --  good habitat for many wild fruits . But there is no official protection . In some areas of the national forests , for example , the Forest Service uses herbicides to discourage berries from overtaking young commercial trees . And on the trails , though signs are posted banning motorized traffic , we heard , even as we collected , the whine of an approaching motor . <p> Many wild relatives of other economically important plants native to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks , in national forests , on Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) lands , in national wildlife refuges , or on other public lands where they receive varying amounts of " unofficial " protection yet no real recognition . USDA/ARS is stepping up the collection and storage of wild relatives in gene banks but has yet to really consider conservation in the wild . A few wild relatives are protected as rare species  --  either federally threatened or endangered or by conservation groups  --  but most wild relatives do not conveniently fit into this designation . Probably the most significant " accidental " conservation of wild relatives of crops is in the National Wlderness Preservation System  --  simply because of the large areas of protected habitat it sets aside . The addition of wilderness areas to Bureau of Land Management lands , now in the final planning stages , will add considerably to that . But biological inventories of public lands fall short of revealing in any detail which wild relatives are present and exactly where they are located . In 1987 , a congressional Office of Technology Assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for about 50 percent of agricultural productivity increases and for annual contributions of about $ 1 billion to U.S. agriculture . " Congress is now considering a biological diversity bill that could assign responsibility for conserving the genetic diversity of all wild plants . We simply do n't know what we 're going to need and want in the decades to come . Yet we can not conserve everything . Finding out where the most useful wild relatives occur in special populations or in high diversity is crucial . With their great present and potential value , wild relatives might be used as a powerful argument for setting aside many more protected areas . <p> Only within the last decade have plant breeders , economic botanists , and conservationists begun to get together and develop strategies for conserving the diversity of wild plants related to crops and other economic plants . In 1974 , the International Board for Plant Genetic Resources ( IBPGR ) , based at the United Nations Food &; Agriculture Organization in Rome , was formed to collect , conserve , evaluate , and promote the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of collecting cultivated varieties of about 120 targeted priority crops and economic plants was largely complete and they turned to the massive job of conserving the wild relatives . Wild relatives respond best to a dual strategy of conservation in seed banks and in the wild . Seed banks , including " field genebanks " such as botanic gardens , are convenient for a number of reasons : breeders have easy access to material ; some of the seeds can be grown out , multiplied plants are kept relatively safe . Some species , such as pecans and other tree crops , are difficult to keep for long as seeds . Conservation in the natural habitat or in small tree farms may be the only way to protect them . But conservation in the wild is valuable for all wild species because it accommodates wide genetic diversity in large populations , allowing them to continue evolving with pests and conditions in the wild . The IBPGR has helped set up and standardize hundreds of the world 's gene banks . It has funded collecting expedition . It has also provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives such as storage of plant tissues or cells , often at very cold temperatures . " Yet conservation in the natural habitat , " says IBPGR 's Executive Secretary Prof. J. Trevor Williams , " has proved a forbidding business . There is simply so much in the wild that must be scientifically evaluated first . It will take enormous inputs of money and scientific expertise to do a good job . " <p> In the early 1980s , IBPGR agreed to work with the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Resources ( IUCN ) , and they have sin funded several joint long-term research projects that are expected to lead to habitat conservation for wild reletive in Columbia , Brazil , and Malaysia . The IBPGR 's work  --  as well as that of WWF and IUCN  --  have focused on the developing world , particularly around the tropics . The plants most of the world uses every day for food mostly originated in the tropics  --  corn and tomatoes ( southern Mexico ) , potatoes and many kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from southwest Asia and rice and millet from China . The wild relatives  --  wild descendants of crops domesticated 6,000 to 10,000 years ago  --  grow in the greatest diversity in these mostly tropical centers of origin and surrounding regions of diversity . The wild relatives of native crops in the United States have consequently been largely overlooked . <p> " Compared to the rest of the world , we may be genepoor in the United States , " says Calvin R. Sperling , who works on the conservation of wild relatives for USDA/ARS in Beltsville . " But we 're far from gene bankrupt . " Sperling 's list of wild relatives of crops and economic species native to the United States is surprisingly long . Besides the many wild small fruits , there are several wild cotton species , sunflowers ( which also produce Jerusalem artichokes ) certain cherries and apples , black walnuts and pecans , clovers , and numerous other wild forages  --  all of which have genes of value for established crops . <p> Many other native American plants might be used to develop new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new crops at USDA/ARS , is a champion of the potato-like groundnut , an all-American nitrogen-fixing tuber that thrives in poor soil and has four eimes the crude protein of potatoes . East coast Indians ate groundnuts  --  " Indian potatoes "  --  for thousands of years , says Duke , and the wild plants rescued the early colonists during the first winters in the New World . Other new crop candidates are the tepary bean and the century plant of , the desert Southwest , as well as wild persimmons , p , iwpaws , chestnuts , hog-peanuts , service-berries , panicgriss , and a host of others . Long before Columbus arrived , the American Indians north of Mexico were using more tlian 1,100 plant species for food . Some plants were from Latin America , but the American Indian , tribe for tribe , pad fewer imported species than we modern Americans and a far more diverse plant diet . <p> Today , the sunflower arguably ranks as America 's most valuable native-plant genetic resource . It is the world 's second most important oil crop . Ii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known array of wild relatives . Thriving across much of the United States , the wild relatives of sunflowers consist of about fifty species and many natural interspecific hybrids . A number of these wild relatives have already provided genes for resistance to various diseases and pests , improving the crop 's hardiness and productivity . Many other genes of wild sunflowers might be used to enhance the crop 's salt and drought tolerance and adaptation to other extreme growing conditions , as well as to improve the seed quality . <p> The sunflower is vital to the agricultural economies of the Soviet Union , Argentina , China , and various European countries  --  all of which grow more sunflowers than the United States . Everywhere it grows as a crop , however , the majestic plant with the bright yellow flowers and dense seedheads seems to invite new diseases . " Sunflower 's wild relatives are absolutely crucial to the future of this crop , " says Gerald Seiler , a research botanist and former curator of the U.S. sunflower germplasm collection . Seiler has spent the past decade tracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American backroads . Through the USDA , Seiler has sent wilf flower seeds to breeders in more than forty countries and has introduced many foreign crop breeders to America 's heartland . On Seiler 's 1989 sunflower exploration through the American Midwest , sponsored by the USDA/ARS , IBPGR and the UN Food &; Agriculture Organization , he was accompanied by Soviet scientists , searching for new wild sunflowers resistant to diseases . <p> The sunflower 's appeal overseas is a switch . Most of the USDA/ARS 's collecting expeditions search the world for wild and primitive cultivated varieties to bring back genes to the United States . The Agricultural Research Service has been criticized for ignoring native wild relatives and failing to support possible new crops . But in 1989 , ARS funded seven two- to six-week-long plant explorations to collect native species growing wild in the United States  --  more domestic trips than in any recent year . There was Jim Luby 's work on wild strawberries and other small fruits , plus expeditions to collect wild blueberries on the East Coast and in the Appalachians , wild forage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rare wild relative of the cereal amaranth in the Carolinas and Florida . With the Center for Plant Conservation , a national group based near Boston that works with local botanical gardens to conserve rare plants , ARS also sponsored three urgent rescue missions in 1989 to collect an endangered wild onion in California , a wild cherry tree in Michigan , and a unique sunflower known to exist in only three wild populations in Texas . And ARS is also funding more work to evaluate material . This is crucial . But much more needs to be done . There is a huge backlog of collected material without any analytical data to accompany it . Evaluating this material would help reveal which plant populations need more collecting as well as point to where they might best be conserved in the wild . ' We know there is much more wild material that breeders could use , " says USDA/ARS 's Sperling . " But it has to be more readily available and properly evaluated . We might even turn up some new economic plants . I 'm sure there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise has been a possible new crop from a little known genus of wild plants found in the disappearing vernal pools of northern California and southern Oregon . The meadowfoam , genus Limnanthes , has seeds with anywhere from 25 to 35 percent oil , suitable for pharmaceutical products and as a high quality lubricant for electronic and other equipment . The new crop is being developed by Oregon State University researchers who crossed two rare wild meadowfoam species , one of which is found only in a six-square-mile area north of Medford , Oregon . Some of the oil produced experimentally has been purchased by the Japanese . " The challenge , " says OSU professor Gary D. Jolliff , " is to increase the oil yield per plant so it can compete in the world market . " For that , he needs more funding and access to the widest possible genetic diversity to improve the crop . That means wild relatives . But the nine known wild species in the genus are all candidates for the endangered species list . The Center for Plant C , Conservation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature Conservancy has protected one of them in a 49-acre reserve in the Rogue Valley of Oregon . USDA/ARS has sponsored the collecting of some of the wild material in the past , but much more needs the done . <p> And Sperling says there is another potential native oilcrop plant from a genus called Lesquerella with many diverse wild relatives . Some day Sperling would like to put together a comprehensive catalogue of wild relatives available in the United State . " The Soviets have already done it there , " he says . " We have a better idea of what is in Russia than in the U.S. We do n't even have a basic flora yet for North America . " <p> Henry L. Shands , national program leader for plant germplasm , based at USDA/ARS in Beltsville , Maryland , adds : ' We have n't done a very good job of collecting , evaluating , and conserving germplasm in our own country . We 've got a lot of work to do to put our own house in order . " <p> The Soviet Union and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting up " genetic reserves " to conserve their wild relatives of crops . The 58,954-acre Sary-Chelek Reserve in the Soviet Union conserves the wild relatives of various nut and fruit trees such as walnuts , apples , pears , and part of the plum-cherry family . Other reserves protect wild pistachio , apricot and almond trees , and wild wheat . India has specific gene sanctuaries for oranges and citrus wild relatives and is planning others . And in Mexico , in March 1988 , a reserve was established because of the recent discovery of a new , potentially valuable wild relative of corn . The 343,330-acre Sierra de Manantlan Biosphere Reserve in the mountains south of Guadalajara protects the only known stands of this primitive wild relative known as diploperennial teosinte , Zea diploperennis . The United States , however , has only a few modest reserves and has yet to organize a specific program to protect the genetic diversity of wild relatives of crops and economic plants . <p> " Many U.S. wild relatives are already located on federal or state lands or in other protected areas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legwork to find out the prime areas . " Some of the information plant breeders like Jim Luby and Gerald Seiler obtain when they go collecting goes into the USDA 's GRIN ( Germplasm Resources Information Network ) database , which lists the more than 500,000 different seed and clonal accessions in USDA genebanks , including their availability and evaluation results and , for those that are wild , where they came from . But for many accessions , the data are incomplete . And there is no indication of any plant 's status in the wild , nor the status of the land it grows on . Some of this information could be picked out by coordinating the GRIN database with the rare plant databases of The Nature Conservancy , the Center for Plant Conservation , and the World Conservation Monitoring Centre , whose Threatened Plants Unit is based at Kew Gardens in England . " That 's just the start , " says Sperling . " Then someone will need to assess habitat conservation needs on a crop by crop , species by species , area by area basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USDA , feel that USDA/ARS must take the lead in identifying what needs to be conserved as part of a mandate to conserve the genetic diversity of wild relatives of crops . But for cost-effective habitat conservation of wild relatives of crops , ARS will need to find out what may already be conserved by the four main public land agencies , as well as by state governments and private groups . <p> For example , the conservation of wild relatives of crops is partly covered by the plant-oriented programs of The Nature Conservancy and the Center for Plant Conservation . " Our main priority for plants is how rare and endangered they are , " says The Nature Conservancy 's chief botanist , Larry E. Morse . The same is true for the Center for Plant Conservation , which has based its priorities on the Nature Conservancy plant lists . The Nature Conservancy and the Center for Plant Conservation lists for plants are longer than the endangered species list  --  those entitled to federal protection . There are only about a dozen wild relatives of crops on the federal list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Fay , U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service botanist , " but many more are candidates for the list . " He cites ten wild sunflowers , nine meadowfoams , eleven clovers , three raspberries , a currant , and a blueberry , among others . The Center for Plant Conservation , which rates plants by the number of years before they might go extinct , lists a few more . But , according to botanist Linda R. McMahan , the center 's director of botanic garden programs , " Wild relatives of alleconomic genera  --  if you include crops , medicinals and potential ornamentals  --  comprise as much as 85 percent of our rare list . " <p> The Center works through local botanical gardens to collect seeds and conserve plants in gardens and in the wild . The Center 's collecting work with wild relatives , such as rare sunflowers , cherries , and onions , was recently funded by ARS , which is supplying scientific expertise and its seed banks for storage . <p> The Nature Conservancy is the main private organization working to acquire and conserve natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal agencies , such as the Forest Service , the Fish and Wildlife Service , and soon the Department of Defense , with which it recently signed an agreement to conduct biological inventories on its 25 million acres . With the assistance of the various state natural heritage programs , based on agreements with the states , certain wild relatives of drops and economic species have been conserved . A recent example is Texas wild-rice , a southern relative of the cultivated wild-rice found around the Great Lakes and cultivated Manchurian water-rice from China . Once abundant along the San Marcos River of central Texas , Texas wild-Ice is now an endangered species , rated by the Center br Plant Conservation as within five years of going extin . The damming of the San Marcos River and other de pment has now reduced this perennial grass to a single opulation in a partly submerged stretch of the river wheJe it can not flower and clings to life only through cloning . <p> The story of wild-riice is an example of a cooperative conservation effort involving federal , state , university , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heritage Program , Southwest Texas State University , and , more recently , the Center for Plant Conservation , through the San Antonio Botanic Gardens , have collected the plant to try to grow it offsite or transplant it , though so far with limited success . Th Fish and Wildlife Service is trying to manage part of the river as " critical habitat " for two of the river 's fish and a salamander , all threatened or endangered ; Texas wild-rice ge some protection in the bargain . Recently , The Nature Conservancy purchased part of the river bank  --  a potential site for a reintroduction . <p> Yet this may all have come too late . Ethnobotanist Gary P. Nabhan of the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix made a painful pilgrimage to see Texas wild-rice for his 1989 book , Enduring Seeds . He called it a surviving species in name more than in behavior . He doubts that it will ever flourish again in anything resembling its original habitat . Still , conservationist are trying , even is a few plants or seeds for breeding may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivated northern wild-rice could be suffering warmer temperatures from the " Greenhouse Effect . " The seeds of Texas wild-rice with a few heat-tolerant genes might go a long way . But healthy wild populations are the best source of genetic diversity for future crops . <p> The rare plant work of The Nature Conservancy and the Center for Plant gonservation is important for crop plant genetic resources  --  particularly if wild relatives can be identified and protected before they become highly endangered or extinct . But most wild relatives of crops are not rare species . Indeed , many wild relatives are weedy , hardy individuals , thriving in areas with some human disturbance . Wild relatives of crops and economic plants have special characteristics , which often dictate different conservation measures , than other plants . With wild relatives , it 's important to conserve the diversity of genes in specific populations of often very common species , subspecies , or varieties . Also valuable are unique plant populations with natural hybrids , or those with resistance to pests or diseases , or populations growing at the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot , wet , or salty conditions . The Endangered Species Act does not protect special populations of plants , and neither do the programs of the plant conservation societies , for the most part . <p> " For The Nature Conservancy , " says its vice-president for science Robert E. Jenkins , " it 's difficult to give emphasis to intra-specific genetic variability over the conservation of so many full species that are needy . But having an area that can be identified as not just of interest to us but to the crop plant people , increases the likelihood that we can protect that piece of property . I do n't see any conflict with collecting a few seeds on these areas once in a while . " <p> The other prime opportunity for the conservation of special populations of wild relatives in the United States is through the public land agencies  --  the National Park Service , the Forest Service , the Bureau of Land Management , and the Fish and Wildlife Service  --  and particularly through the National Wilderness Preservation System . But in all cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the threats . National Park Service <p> Out of its total domain of nearly 80 million acres , the Nation , al'Park Service administers numerous areas purely for natural and recreational values . Many wild relatives in park areas can handle a high number of visitor days  --  as long as the plants are suitably protected . In too many areas they are not , and while the system embraces 38.5 million acres of designated wilderness , not even this is a guarantee of protection in all cases . The popularity of Saguaro National Monument in Arizona , for instance , in spite of the park 's 71,600 acres of wilderness , has contributed to the decline of Thornber 's fishhook cactus , known for its edible fruits , because of visitor pressure and surrounding development . The lesson is that wherever wild relatives are found on parks or other public lands , they need specific ecological management plans . Yet , to date , little attention has been paid to this , in the parks or elsewhere . <p> More positively , in 1989 , the Park Service theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system , educational programs revolved around the idea of conserving diversity . Four parks in the Western Region , each representing a distinct ecological type , were chosen to design and implement model programs on biodiversity Plant surveys at Sequoia National Park , for example , have revealed that the park contains several wild relatives of sunflowers and a wild amaranth . And in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park , there is a vulnerable wild cotton found only in Hawaii . This cotton has already been useful to commercial cotton as a source of resistance to the Iygus bug and jassids , while its nectarless flowers reduce the incidence of boll rot and the number of browsing insects . <p> As part of its biological diversity initiative , the Park Service , with the University of Massachusetts , has also recently surveyed all park sites to determine which have fruit and nut trees . Investigators were mainly looking for early cultivated varieties , but the survey turned up some wild material as well , mainly native American plum trees . One third of the sites reported fruit and nut trees ranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the project , the rare germplasm will be identified , collected , and managed . <p> The Park Service also administers the National Natural Landmarks Program , which recognizes outstanding sites containing nationally significant ecological or geological features . Natural Landmarks status can be conferred on land under any ownership . Through designation , owners are encouraged to protect the area in non-binding agreements . Since 1962 , the Secretary of the Interior has designated more than 600 such areas throughout the United States . According to Hardy L. Pearce , former Acting Chief of the Park Service 's Natural Resources Program Branch , " Many natural landmarks contain rare plants . In fact , many may be the best remaining examples of various biotic community types in the country . " Pearce was n't sure what role the program could play in the conservation of gene pools of useful wild plants . Some natural landmarks contain wild relatives , says Pearce , but they could not be designated for this reason alone . Forest Service <p> National forests and grasslands occupy about 191 million acres in forty-two states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are outstanding living repositories for small native fruits , especially blueberries , raspberries , and strawberries . The Coronado National Forest of Arizona has a wild relative of cotton that has been used in breeding work to increase the fiber strength of commercial cotton and as a source of resistance to several pests . The Chattahoochee National Forest of Georgia and the Uwharrie National Forest of North Carolina have several wild sunflowers , one species endangered . The nineteen national grasslands contain other wild sunflowers , plus clovers and many forages . <p> In 1988 the Forest Service signed an agreement with The Nature Conservancy to help identify and manage " sensitive " species before they are pushed to the legal definitions of " threatened " or " endangered " species . There are now almost 1,000 sensitive plant species in the national forests and grasslands , in addition to forty-five species designated threatened include a wild crabberry , gooseberries , an elderberry them located in the Southern Region . <p> But are wild relatives compatible with Forest Service activities of logging and cattle grazing ? It depends . As mandated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is assessing the impact of its logging and grazing activity on sensitive species . Yet , says Glen Contreras , threatened and endangered species branch chief for the Service , " We 're finding that fence them amd leave them ' is not the solution for all plants . Many need burning or for a specific microhabitat to be maintained . " <p> Blueberries , raspberries , and many other small fruits for example , flourish in openings in the forest , whether caused by fire , natural falls , or logging . However , clearcut logging on the steep slopes of the Northwest , such as in parts of Olympic National Forest , has led to mass erosion , after which almost nothing grows . And replanting one or two commercial trees species with herbicides in other areas eliminates most small fruit populations . On the national grasslands , the problems are different . In general , cattle grazing helps few plants . <p> The Forest Service has a system of research natural areas for wild stands of its commercial tree and rangeland species . Currently 204 such areas cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed . The areas are permanent " genetic reserves " for forest and rangeland species and will be important for maintaining the genetic diversity of future commercial forests and rangelands . A number of these would protect plant communities distinguished simply by being rare or containing rare plants . <p> Besides research natural areas , the Forest Service has botanical , recreation , and other special-use areas  --  some of which contain small populations of wild relatives of crops but none of which provides permanent , undisturbed protection . As on Park Service lands , Forest Service-administered wilderness  --  some 33 million acres  --  offers the best protection for most wild relatives of crops . <p> Like all federal agencies , the Forest Service 's conservation work and effectiveness in fulfilling its mandate varies by region . Partly it is the personnel who work there and partly the people and pressure groups that work with them . The Forest Service in California is particularly good at managing wild plants , says Linda McMahan of the Center for Plant Conservation . The national forests there occupy 20 percent of the land base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich flora of 7,000 plant species . Jim Shevock , regional botanist for the Forest Service , works closely with the California Native Plant Society and California Department of Fish and Game , which has developed the Natural Diversity Data Base . This valuable data base is a computerized inventory of where populations of rare and threatened plants , animals , and natural communities can be found . Shevock uses the data base to develop specific management prescriptions for many wild plants , including a half-dozen of the meadowfoams , potentially valuable for their oil . Bureau of Land Management <p> The Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) administers almost half of all public lands  --  over 272 million acres , most of which is spread over thirteen western states . Compared to the other public land agencies , the BLM has been slow to manage for conservation . As on the Forest Service 's national grasslands , livestock grazing on BLM lands is the main reason plant populations are declining , but the problem on BLM lands is much greater . Grazing there has caused widespread soil erosion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over habitats of native plants . <p> Like the Forest Service , the BLM has a system of research natural areas , as well as outstanding natural areas , but the BLM has been much less effective in protecting natural areas than the other large public land agencies . Through the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 Congress directed the agency to give priority to determining areas of critical environmental concern ( ACEC ) to protect , among other things , wildlife resources and natural values . <p> But now , more than a decade later , a 1989 report on the BALM prepared by the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) , found that this BLM has failed to provide " significantly improved protection " for the public 's resources . By the end of 1988,389 ACECs had been designated , covering only 2 percent of BLM lands . Few of them displaced cattle grazing or other BLM activities , and protection and management presicriptions for the land , according to the NRDC , were minimal . The report declared that ACECs , in general , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those surveyed were under 1,000 acres  --  a size that would make life difficult for many population of wild relatives of crops . <p> The BLM is now in the process of suggesting areas for the National Wilderness Preservation System . About 25 million acres of BLM lands have been placed under study ( too few , say many conservationists ) , and recommendations must be made to the President by October 1991 . Bringing a share of BLM lands into the Wilderness Preservation System will be critical to the conservation of America 's native plants , including wild relatives of crops and other economic plants . Most existing wilderness covers middle-to high-elevation terrain . The wilderness study areas on BLM lands contain many lower elevation ecosystems not represented in the Wilderness Preservation System  --  although the agency 's recommendations so far include far less land than they should , according to most of the conservation community . <p> This could be a crucial lack . A multi-agency effort to identify the number of ecosystems in the National Wilderness Preservation System revealed that in a ten-state region of the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other agency 's wilderness holdings  --  more than the other three agencies combined . Ecosystem diversity tends to support species and genetic diversity . For wild relatives of crops , species or varieties that range across several different ecosystems typically show high genetic diversity . <p> " BLM lands also cover many dry and desert ecosystems with some particularly valuable wild relatives of crops , " says the Desert Botanical Garden 's Gary Nabhan . These include wild agaves , sunflowers , prickly pears , beans , and several varieties of gourds . " We 're going to need genes from wild plants like these in an increasingly dry , hot world . " Nabhan says that there are over 500 wild relatives of crop and economic plants found in the Southwest alone , sixty to seventy-five of which are threatened or endangered . " We hope BLM wilderness can protect some of them , " he says . U.S.Fish &; Wildlife Service <p> As the lead federal agency in the conservation of wildlife , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ( USFWS ) administers the Endangered Species Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both public and private lands . The USFWS also administers the National Wildlife Refuges , a 90 million-acre system that includes 19.3 million acres of designated wilderness . Some plants , including wild relatives of crops , are protected on National Wildlife Refuges . A disease-resistant wild relative of corn in the genus Tripsacum , for example , grows in the moist soils of Island Bay National Wildlife Refuge in Florida . It 's a candidate for listing as a threatened or endangered species . Other National Wildlife Refuges protect several wild sunflowers . But plant protection in the refuge system is mostly secondary or incidental to target animal species . <p> " We have only been in the plant business for fifteen years , " says Fish and Wildlife botanist John Fay . " We 're still learning , but plants are a big and growing part of the endangered species program . One problem we have in administering the Endangered Species Act is that not every plant and animal conservation problem is an endangered species problem . Sometimes it is a genetic diversity or habitat preservation problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have the legal tools to do anything about it . " <p> The USFWS has sponsored re-introductions of a number of listed plants , such as cactus on public lands in New Mexico to complement a site owned by The Nature Conservancy . " But , " says the Center for Plant Conservation 's McMahan , " for the most part , plants get the short end of the deal . There 's money for recovery of species that are listed as threatened or endangered but almost all of it goes for the glamor animal species and very little for plants  --  even something as attractive and highly endangered as the Florida Torrea of the Florida panhandle . The USFWS wrote a beautiful plan for recovery of the Florida Torrea , but in terms of actual money to get it conserved , there 's been nothing yet . And that 's generally true across the country . Federal money just does n't become available on the same level for conserving plants . It 's a problem that needs to be addressed . It 's not working now with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " national plant refuges , " with funds from Congress earmarked for plants , would help preserve wild plant species in the federal public lands system . And it could include not only threatened and endangered plants , but disjunct , hybrid , and other special populations of wild relatives that USDA/ARS might target as valuable and possibly useful for future breeders . National plant refuges could supplement the much larger populations conserved in wilderness areas . Says John Fay , " I think we 're set up to take the lead on conserving plant genetic resources in the natural habitat but we 'd need a mandate and more money from Congress . " <p> Such a mandate could come with passage of a biological diversity act . A good biological , diversity act could distribute some of the responsibilitiesperhaps in a way comparable to the Endangered Species Act , which made all public land agencies responsible for compliance . On the face of it , conserving biological diversity should not be a tough package to sell , since many genetic resources are used in crops and economic plants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . The advances in biotechnology , with radical gene transfers and other techniques , are enabling plant breeders to use a much wider pool of material . Almost anything , if conserved , could be useful in the future . A model biological diversity act could set an example for the world , just as our Wilderness and Endangered Species act have done . <p> With or without such act , it is generally conceded that much more work must be done to survey and study genetic diversity on public lands . Henry Shands of USDA/ARS says he would welcome worthwhile proposals for surveys and studies toward conserving wild relatives in their natural habitat . Such work would help provide a solid biological basis  --  and a stronger argument  --  for securing many more wilderness areas . <p> Wild relatives often take time to reveal their full value . It may be ten or fifteen years before the wild strawberries we collected last July in northern Minnesota will contribute their fragnant , cold-hardy , disease resistant genes to a variety that wakes us up in the morning , even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wild strawberries are there for birds , bears , and people to enjoy as part of America 's natural heritage . But if Jim Luby 's breeding work proves productive , he says he 's return to that same strawberry patch in Chippewa National Forest , and he 'll be prospecting for even mor diversity  --  maybe future wild strawberries slowly evolving to fight new challenges to their survival  --  and with their survival , perhaps something of our own . <p> By BY ERICH HOYT <p>
