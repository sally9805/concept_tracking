After a solid year of scum  --  a soiled blue dress , a scheme to buy silence , witness intimidation , and lies , lies , lies  --  you might think Bill Clinton would be ready to get back to doing his job . But you would be wrong . According to the New York Times , our cigar-abusing , bongo-thumping President plans to celebrate the Senate 's highly charitable verdict by launching " an all-out offensive to knock off his foes . " It 's not enough for this self-absorbed wretch to defile the nation 's highest office . Now he 's dragging his whole party into the muck . And amazingly , Democrats are buying into the Big Creep 's definition of victory : three-quarters of the country believe he is untrustworthy and lacking ethical standards , and they 're popping corks . Party leaders are united in defense of this man  --  their guiding principles of moral and legal relativity have been elevated to an art form ( one standard for liberal Presidents , another for everyone else ) . The politics of personal destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarence Thomas , et al. ) has , on Clinton 's behalf , been perfected by pornographers and private eyes . <P> In short , as the millennium elections approach , Democrats represent the party of degradation , double talk , double standards and political destruction . Buoyed by their odd conception of victory , they are launching Operation Perpetual Impeachment , targeting outspoken presidential critics for political extinction in 2000 . For Republicans the temptation to do battle with them  --  for retribution , validation , vindication  --  will be enormous . But the G.O.P. needs to resist taking this bait and return to fighting over big issues , not small men . <P> Republicans can safely resume their rightful role as agenda setters and not worry about the latest cynical Clintonite " war , " because the new offensive is doomed . These pathological partisans must have battle fatigue , because they have devised a strategy based on three grave political miscalculations : <P> No troops . The voters are reeling . In the immortal words of Richard Douglas Llamas , the Senate impeachment heckler , " Good God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battlefields . The most outspoken Republican targets are from outspokenly Republican districts ; they would be strung up had they not pushed for impeachment . <P> No general . In presidential races issues flow down from the top of the ticket . Is Al Gore really going to wave the bloody impeachment shirt , reminding voters of complicity in this most ethically challenged Administration ?
