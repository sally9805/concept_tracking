<p> Gregor von Rezzori , whose novels and memoirs revealed the tragic sweep of European history through two world wars and beyond , died last Thursday at his home in Donnini , a village near Florence . He was 83 and also had homes in Manhattan and on the island of Rhodes . <p> The cause was a heart attack , said Elizabeth Sifton , his editor at Farrar , Straus &; Giroux . <p> Mr. von Rezzori wrote most of his work in German , though he also produced highly admired prose in English and Italian . In whatever language , he evoked the collapsed polyglot world of the Austro-Hungarian Empire into which he was born . He once described himself as " a living anachronism , " and " a man dreaming of a lost homeland . " <p> That homeland , as it emerges from his provocatively titled novel " Memoirs of an Anti-Semite " ( published in 1981 in the United States ) or from his less fictionalized autobiographical work " The Snows of Yesteryear " ( 1989 ) was rooted geographically , culturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at the time of Mr. von Rezzori 's birth on May 13 , 1914 , was an outpost of the Austro-Hungarian Empire . The empire collapsed with the outbreak of World War I a few months later , and Bukovina would experience the convulsions of history that would remake the face of Europe . <p> Mr. von Rezzori would watch his homeland fall under the rule of Romania and the Soviet Union ; today it is divided between Ukraine and Romania . But it was Bukovina as it was ruled from Vienna that served as the point of departure for Mr. von Rezzori 's life and work . His hometown of Czernowitz ( now Chernovtsy in Ukraine ) had a rich but complicated national and ethnic history , and much of his work depicts the loss of a familiar , if never idealized , order and the onset of chaos . <p> Whether writing autobiography or fiction , Mr. Von Rezzori kept dissecting himself , mining his experience with an unadorned and unsympathetic memory . The narrator of his " Memoirs of an Anti-Semite , " a man also named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of survival he possesses is " the artful feat of always holding up a new possibility of himself , a fiction of himself . " <p> The critic Stanley Kauffmann , reviewing the novel in The New York Times Book Review , described " Memoirs " as " a literature in which the author envisions himself as a character in a design arranged from the data of his life as another author might arrange items from fictitious notes . " <p> " Memoirs of an Anti-Semite " was first published in 1979 , when the author was 65 . It is composed of five connected stories , each dealing in some measure with the protagonist 's relationship with Jews and with the expressions of attitudes toward Jews over several decades . Much of the protagonist 's life resembles that of the author , who was the son of a snobbish Austro-Hungarian official who was responsible for the maintenance of art in Orthodox churches . Despite their Sicilian forebears , the von Rezzoris spoke German as their first language . As a young man the author could also make his way linguistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yiddish-speaking Jews who lived in his hometown . <p> In the stories that make up " Memoirs of an Anti-Semite , " the fictional Gregor is taught in his upper-class home to have contempt for Jews as aliens , rivals , inferiors . He reveals his disdain for his Jewish classmates but makes exceptions for Jewish women , with whom he has affairs . At one point he finds himself in Vienna on the night of March 11 , 1938 , and is swept along by Nazi demonstrators celebrating the Anschluss . Later he marries a Jewish woman and becomes the father of a boy , whom he adores . But when the child dies at the age of 5 , he confides that he would have been more comfortable had the child been born a girl since the son appeared to be " himself as a Jew . " <p> The work is characterized by a candor and unstinting description of attitudes that the author must have known from both experience and observation .

" It is through Mr. von Rezzori 's art , rather than through any vanity or apology , that we are enlightened . " <p> Mr. von Rezzori focused more closely on his childhood and his family in " The Snows of Yesteryear , " a volume of reminiscences . Here the domineering , philandering and anti-Semitic figure is clearly identified as the writer 's father , a descendant of impoverished nobles who left Sicily to serve emperors in Vienna . His mother is portrayed as an overprotective woman who believed she had married beneath her station . <p> Of his parents , Mr. von Rezzori writes : " Their obsessions  --  our mother 's anxiety-whipped , guilt-ridden sense of duty and our father 's blindly passionate escape into his mania for hunting  --  were specific responses to circumstances that in no way fitted their upbringing , their existential concepts and expectations , even less their dispositions . We lived in the Bukovina  --  more radically than would have been the case elsewhere  --  as the flotsam of the European class struggle , which is what the two great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad and dislocated personalities in a period that also was mad and dislocated and filled with unrest . " <p> In her review in The New York Times , Michiko Kakutani wrote : " In the story of his own family he finds a parable of Europe 's dissolution ; in the confusions of his own parents , a mirror of the losses sustained by that vanishing class of the haute bourgeoisie . " She added : " The wounds the family sustained were psychic ones : a Chekhovian sense of displacement , the perception that all the old certainties  --  of class , religion and society  --  had abruptly vanished , a disorienting fear that the world no longer corresponded to expectations . " <p> The book also contains Mr. von Rezzori 's impressions of a visit he paid to his hometown 50 years after he left it in what was to be Czernowitz 's last year under Communism . Writing in The New York Review of Books , Michael Ignatieff said that Mr. von Rezzori could well be " the last great remembrancer of a region that has vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. von Rezzori spent much of World War II in Berlin . In " Memoirs of an Anti-Semite " the fictional Gregor confessed that he had been " a hideous fop , cynically watching the world in flames . " In 1985 , the real Gregor drew on his wartime experiences to write a huge novel called " The Death of My Brother Abel , " in which among many threads of narrative he presented the perspective of small aristocrats refusing to see the disappearance of their cultural and physical world . <p> Elie Wiesel , writing in The Washington Post , said : " If a great novel can be recognized by its obsessions , its characters and above all its tone , then ' The Death of My Brother Abel ' is unquestionably great . " <p> These books secured Mr. von Rezzori 's international reputation rather late in his life . But altogether he wrote some 20 books , beginning shortly after the war while also working as a radio script writer in Germany .

He was acclaimed for carefully following his own precept : " You must never undertake the search for time lost in the spirit of nostalgic tourism . " <p> A handsome man and an engaging conversationalist , he was once described by Francine du Plessix Gray as having " a majestic courtly manner that made him look as if he were perennially hosting a reception in some Middle European palace . " In fact , as a personal protest of war and the irrationality of politics , he spent decades as a stateless person until the inconvenience of seeking visas drove him to take up Austrian nationality . <p> He cherished friendship , maintaining it was the central ingredient to any happiness , " vastly superior to romance , family , children , sexual love .

Another friend , the writer Bruce Chatwin , wrote about staying in the medieval tower that the von Rezzoris offered to guests at their farmhouse in Tuscany . Michael Ondaatje , the Canadian writer and author of " The English Patient , " was another frequent writing guest . <p> Mr. von Rezzori is survived by his wife . He had two sons by an earlier marriage to a Prussian woman , but details of his survivors were incomplete yesterday .
