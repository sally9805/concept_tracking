Truth <p> She did n't finish One Hundred Years of Solitude , ca n't understand a word of Ashbery 's poetry and returns Nadine Gordimer 's books , unread , to the well-wishers who press them upon her . The sight of crystals makes her chakras combative , meditation causes a fine rash to rise on her upper arm , and she practices yoga as a competitive sport . She never knew anyone personally who was killed in Vietnam . None of her friends has died of AIDS , none has tested HIV-positive , few have even tested , except for her current lover , an ex-heroin addict who 's been checked every year for the past five and says they should go in together next time . She 's told him of her mild risks : the escapades in foreign countries , a few seasons as a middle-class barfly , the long affairs with married men , designed to keep heart and pride permanently stalled and to guarantee permanent control of the remote . Sundays , she makes him leave before noon , citing 11:00 as checkout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand one , " she sings from a song he does n't recognize . If she ever relents , he will mimic her restrictions in a nasal squeak , " I have to have rules ; when we started this , you knew my time was limited ; I ca n't just be at your beck and call , " in a voice still gentle , that waits for adoration to realign itself with scorn . He is always gentle with her , except when they make love . When they walk down the street , he holds her hand up , away from her body , as if to protect it , or to keep it from inflicting harm on herself . If she forgets and stands on tiptoe to kiss him , he eases her heels down , and cradles her head , sideways , against his chest . There is the danger , his heartbeat at the crown of her head , pushing at her skull , if not searching for a crevice to enter , then making itself necessary with its regularity , dependability , white noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the voice of judgment , an award to the recipient who gives herself so compulsively , so completely , you 'd swear this is all there ever was . <p> Dare <p> He , who could take no drugs ; she , who could take no alcohol , a nineties version of Jack Sprat and his wife . She stashes liters of water in her house near the various places they might end up making love : by the glass doors opening out to the patio , behind the living-room couch , on the bedside table . The second night , her knees ground into the carpet , she wondered how they 'd keep on with this  --  no drink , no mood alterations to blur edges , loosen the tongue of depression flattened in their mouths . It 's the lithium , she says , apologizing for her constant thirst . It 's also the touch of nicotine on his tongue , the sweat she breaks even in winter in her poorly insulated house , the fear of risking her manageable loneliness on him . Neither of them has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months pile up like snowdrifts , she grows more and more afraid . When he told her the stories of the shooting galleries in Juarez , cruising dark downtown streets on Christmas Eve looking for enough to get through another holiday , the last time ever in his sister 's bathroom , shaking and sick , she felt the vicarious thrills fleshing out her literary past . De Quincey bored her , but there was the poetic nihilism of Anna Kavan , the spleen and ennui fighting over Baudelaire , even the repulsive attraction of Bukowski 's down-and-outness . She has so little to trade him : giving up sweets to control incipient hypoglycemia is unworthy . He wants love , and she has waited , nigh onto bursting , before saying the word . Oh starry starry night , this is how I want to die . It makes him nervous when she quotes Anne Sexton ; he holds her close and murmurs words that are meant to be soothing , but she does n't believe that he can protect her , take care of her , love , comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe in God , he 's stopped wearing the gold earring in the shape of a cross . She wants to tell him it does n't matter , that she believes most of the current crosses are inspired more by style than faith , but she ca n't bring herself to do so because something matters , something in her mortal mind that causes her to hold out her hands to him , wrist up , to reveal the protruding veins she has always thought uglier than sin . He will draw his forefinger down a conspicuous blue line and tell her it was a mark of beauty in the age of Cleopatra . And tell her that some things never change . <p> Jean Rhys in Mexico <p> He 'd been working out at La Estetica Gymnasia on Lopez Mateos Once he crossed the border next fall he would have no problems blending in , with his American-style pecs , triceps and a heel-to-toe stride that added swagger to his grace . So when he strolled through the outdoor cafe on Pedro Moreno and the American woman raised her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she wore sunglasses , he could tell she observed him . There would be a melancholy , nostalgic look in her eyes . She studied his shoulders , his faded Levi 501s , the worn Benetton T-shirt . Perhaps she admired his muscles . Perhaps she was tired of the same conversations with waiters and taxi drivers . He sat down on one of the plaza benches and waited for her to finish her beer . It was <p> Bohemia ; strong for American women . Maybe strong enough to make her walk by his bench and then he could ask her what time it was . He watched her . She was looking down , observing the traveler 's custom , but of course with the small shudder of her profiled face that signified a blinking back of tears . Another triste senora . He knew them well . They avoided the shade , even on days like this , and turned their faces to the sun . In their oversized handbags they carried brochures of the Ballet Folklorico and guidebook lists of the markets where the curanderas might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized the twisted shape of this one 's earrings . From Tlaquepaque , where she 'd probably paid as much for the story about their significance as the silver . Tonight , when she dined alone , she would be seated in the married couples ' section of the restaurant out of courtesy . When the children with roses came in , some man would extract a single rose from the bunch he bought for his wife and send it to her table . <p> He waited to leave until she lifted the glass and tilted her head slightly . Her throat was not unattractive although she had to be over thirty or over forty , hard to tell with these women . The ones that made it this far south were the ones that aged well . But oh , how many broken hearts they labored under . He knew he did not have to understand the sadness , knew she 'd be grateful if he 'd speak to her in his own language , allowing her to practice the few twisted phrases she could summon . She would even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet him later on . But when she left , he would feel an uncomfortable regret as the motes and particles of her irrelevant sadness settled over him . She would again reach for her glass , he would rise and she would watch him across the plaza . For a moment he felt the horror of knowing the moves , the sequence , the time allotted for each interchange , the absolute fear of everything that would happen next . <p> Why I 'm in Vietnam : Answer 2/Bong Sen Hotel , Saigon <p> I 'm hoping when I get back to the hotel , no one will see me . I 'm head-to-toe with red mud from crawling through old VC tunnels enlarged for heftier western bodies and winding through jungle trails on the back of a motorcycle . My hair 's stringy with sweat and rain . But the lobby 's full of Australian vets here on a tour so I call out a cheery , " I wanted adventure and I got it ! " One of the vets pulls out a chair and my shaky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiry in denim jeans and vest , faded from wear , not fashion , and pre-vogue tattoos cover his arms , nautical motifs of anchors and ships intertwined with dragons and pagodas . This is his fifth time back since the war . " So you 're doing this on your own , " he says . " That 's game . " At the moment I feel more gamy than game , but I am grateful to him and we begin trading stories about our failed marriages , making escape through deceit and trickery , fighting fire with fire . I grow hyperbolic , say I 'm small-minded and petty , still bitter after all these years , calculating acts of mental revenge , on a pilgrimage of contention to vanquish that long-vanished rival . He says I sound hungry and we walk down the street to a noodle stall on the corner , sit down on the doll-sized stools and lift bowls of steaming soup with tiny dried shrimp and thick slices of tofu that I praise so much I 'm presented with a huge complimentary bowl . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit defeat and surrender my bowl with words of thanks and apology that must all be in the wrong tones as the women sitting around the soup kettle laugh , but the one in charge points to herself , then me and opens her arms wide . I take a chance on the pantomime and lean into a hug . Everyone laughs again , but approvingly . Murray nods at me and we walk back , arm in arm like the lovers in front of the Municipal Theater , the ones without cycles , the ones who watch the endless procession of couples cruising the town in elaborate formation at each intersection , weaving in perfect choreography without traffic lights , without traffic police , in absolute control of what , to us , seems impossible , if not terrible . <p> Why I 'm in Vietnam : Answer 4/Hue <p> Say it 's because of Walter Cronkite and his reporting of the Tet Offensive , 1968 : " Shelling the Imperial Capitol of Hue , " " Storming the Citadel , " " Destruction of the Forbidden City . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocabulary like a sad poem in a foreign language where the unfamiliar phrases assume a kind of isolate sovereignty , and are left unapproached , out of laziness , out of fear . Say that Hue became for me a symbol of grace and dignity , of irreplaceable treasure ruinate ; and I kept it symbolic , safe , untouched in my mind as <p> miser 's gold . <p> Now I 'm taking the scenic route from Da Nang to Hue on a winding road over three mountains , clinging to the back of a motorcycle , behind the ebullient and tenacious Mr. Tam who comes with a tiny notebook of recommendations from previous passengers and a letter proving the U.S. Army employed his father as a forklift operator for three years . This may be symbolic , but it is not safe . The road is narrow with hairpin curves and all traffic favors the middle ; we slip so closely by the side of an approaching bus that I can feel the rough sleeve of the bus helper who leans in his troubleshooting position out the rear door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a mere courageous gasp , but Mr. Tam half-turns his head and scolds , " Do n't move ! Do n't worry ! I know this road ! " I want to protest that I have n't moved , but I remember the night bus out of Saigon and the tiny woman settled against me , relentlessly immobile , entrenched , cast as if in a mold while I twitched and scratched , wriggled and squirmed . I close my eyes to the oncoming traffic to keep myself still ; when Mr. Tam shouts the name of a mountain or a lovely village below , I shout back the name to show I understand . I do not see Heaven Mountain , Cloudy Pass or the view of the beaches at Vinh Loc , but I am steadfast in my quiescence , alternately benumbed and cramped . <p> Mr. Tam shouts " Hue ! " and I open my eyes . We are crossing a bridge over what must be the Perfume River , to 1968 Street and the Hoa Binh Guest House . A little boy with a basket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame ! " partly in greeting , partly to alert the other vendors . " Madame , you buy ! " he asks and without waiting for the practiced shake of my head , continues , " Madame see Forbidden City ! Totally awesome place ! " I have smiled a great deal in this country , but now I am laughing , the inelegant whoop I try to curb even back home , and under the disapproving eye of Mr. Tam I bargain awkwardly , exchanging precious American dollars for gum and cookies , smuggled Kodak film and a bamboo fan that releases a delicate scent of lotus when waved before me . <p>
