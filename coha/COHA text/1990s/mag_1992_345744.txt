While the details are disputed , this much is plain : something grim and unconscionable happened in the Azerbaijani town of Khojaly two weeks ago . So far , some 200 dead Azerbaijanis , many of them mutilated , have been transported out of the town tucked inside the Armenian-dominated enclave of Nagorno- Karabakh for burial in neighboring Azerbaijan . The total number of dead  --  the Azerbaijanis claim 1,324 civilians were slaughtered , most of them women and children  --  is unknown . But the facile explanation offered by the attacking Armenians , who insist that no innocents were deliberately killed , is hardly convincing . <P> The assault represents an alarming escalation in the hostilities that are rapidly pushing Christian Armenia and Muslim Azerbaijan toward all-out war . Over the past four years the two republics have pressed their territorial claims to Nagorno-Karabakh , a 1,700-sq. - mi. piece of turf located within Azerbaijan 's boundaries but home mainly to Armenians . Until the breakup of the Soviet Union , Azerbaijan held the upper hand , owing to military support from units of the now disintegrating Seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow 's liberals and democrats , who disliked the collusion between Azerbaijan and Kremlin hard-liners . <P> Now perceptions are shifting as Azerbaijanis assume the role of underdog and Armenians appear to be the predatory wolves . Videotapes circulated by the Azerbaijanis include images of disfigured civilians , some of them scalped , others shot through the head . Armenians claim the footage is fake . They insist that they left a corridor open for civilians to flee Khojaly but that Azerbaijani soldiers led a group of 200 civilians into harm 's way . The use of surface-to-air missiles , sophisticated Grad rocket batteries and armor proves that both sides are now armed with state-of-the-art weapons that were bequeathed by , sold by or stolen from Soviet units . <P> Although Nagorno-Karabakh is small , the implications of the violence are large . Officials from other republics regard the outcome as a test for the future prospects of the patchwork Commonwealth of Independent States . Nursultan Nazarbayev , President of Kazakhstan , warns that the clash may " create a precedent for uncontrolled development of conflicts within the C.I.S . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mishandling the crisis . Meanwhile , Russian President Boris Yeltsin called upon the two republics to " show political will and wisdom and start a dialogue . " But with the guns sounding so loudly , it is hard to imagine how the two sides will be able to hear each other .
