txt // phone in the evening ; there is less pressure on the phone company 's resources , so that each call costs less to provide . Nevertheless , the discount is for the time you make the call . It is evening calls that the phone company markets at a discount , not calls when few people are using the phone . As I explained in section 4.4 , the fertility of the economy 's productive system is the chief cause why future commodities are cheaper . The fact that people , like the person in figure 4.2 , end up assigning a lower value to future commodities than present ones is more an effect than a cause . People arrange their affairs so as to consume more in the future , and consequently they end up assigning less value to future commodities at the margin . But even if it were a cause , the discount would still be for time . Commodities are discounted by their own interest rates , and an interest rate is a discount for time . 4.6 Commodities that should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market price method , and said what is right about it . Now I come to what is wrong with it . A lot of sound objections have been raised against it , but I shall mention only three here.la The first objection is not to the theory of the market price method , but to the way the method is applied in practice . I explained that a commodity in the future normally has a lower price than in the present . It is discounted , that is to say , and the appropriate discount is given by its own interest rate . According to the theory , each commodity should be discounted at its own rate . But in practice all commodities are generally lumped together and discounted at the same rate . Normally , they are all discounted at something called the real ' interest rate , which is a weighted average of the own interest rates of various commodities . This may be an acceptable approximation for most commodities . Most commodities are produced within the economic system , and most of them have similar own interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But some commodities have quite different rates . These include nonreproducible scarce resources , which are not produced at all . I explained in section 4.4 that most present commodities can , in a sense , be converted into a greater quantity of future commodities . That is why future commodities are generally cheaper than present ones . But this is true only of commodities that are produced within the economic system . Scarce resources can not be converted into a greater quantity of future resources , and they therefore have own interest rates of zero or thereabouts . ' ' I t follows that they ought not to be discounted , even according to the theory of the market price method . Derek Parfit gives an example : a stretch of beautiful countryside , which might be destroyed to build an airport . ' ' ' The value of this scarce resource will remain the same through time ; it will not // decline like the value of produced commodities . It ought not to be discounted , and the theory underlying the market price method says it ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodity that ought not to be discounted . Some industrial plants cause congenital deformities amongst people born in their neighbourhoods . In valuing the plants , cost ? benefit analysts often discount deformities that will happen in the distant future ; they give them less significance than present ones . But Parfit says that is a mistake . A deformity caused at one time is just as bad as a deformity caused at another . It leads to the same loss of wellbeing , and , since Parfit believes wellbeing ought not to be discounted , he believes deformities ought not to be discounted either . ' ? Let us grant the premise that wellbeing ought not to be discounted . Then I am sure Parfit is right that deformities ought not to be discounted . But this example is theoretically tricky , and more needs to be said about it . Some commodities represent a constant quantity of wellbeing whenever they occur ; let us call them constant-wellbeing commodities . Deformities are a negative constant-wellbeing commodity . For theoretical purposes , it is easier to work with positive commodities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the positive commodity of saving people from deformities . Saving people 's lives is plausibly another example of a constant-wellbeing commodity ; on average , saving a person 's life in one hundred years ' time will presumably add just as much wellbeing to the world as saving a person 's life now . Granted that wellbeing ought not to be discounted , constant-wellbeing commodities ought not to be discounted . Some constant-wellbeing commodities are scarce resources , but some are not . Life saving is not , for instance . Life saving is actually a produced commodity . People 's lives are saved by care in hospitals , by installing safety devices in factories , by propaganda against smoking , and in many other ways ; these are all ways in which the commodity of life saving is produced by the economy . Furthermore , life saving participates in the general fertility of the productive system . It is like timber : a quantity of life saving in the present can be converted into a greater quantity in the future . We can , if we choose , use fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so have greater resources available next year , which we could use to save more lives next year . Because present timber can be converted into a greater quantity of future timber , future timber must be cheaper than present timber in equilibrium . Timber is therefore discounted . Surely , therefore , the same should be true of life saving . Future life saving is cheaper than present life saving ; so life saving should be discounted . But this contradicts my earlier remn rk t hat it should not be discounted because it is a constant-well-being commodity . So there is a puzzle . Which is right ? // The answer is that the earlier remark was right : if life saving is a constantwellbeing commodity , it should not be discounted . Life saving in the future will make the same contribution to wellbeing as life saving in the present . Sure enough , future life saving is cheaper than present life saving , but this is not a reason for valuing it less . The market prices of commodities have a role in valuations only because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In equilibrium , they will do so , and up to now I have been assuming the economy is in equilibrium . But if life saving produces constant wellbeing , and yet is cheaper in the future , we evidently do not have an equilibrium . With ordinary commodities like timber , there is a market that will move to equilibrium if it is working smoothly . But with life saving there is no such market . Nor is there one for saving people from deformities . We have no reason to discount these commodities at an interest rate that has been established in the market for marketed commodities . There is more to the puzzle , though . If we can convert a quantity of life saving now into a greater quantity next year , and if life saving next year is just as valuable as life saving now , the conclusion we have to draw is that life saving should be deferred . We should withdraw resources from life saving today , and apply them to saving more lives next year . We should also defer life saving next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after . We should defer life saving the year after in order to save still more the year after that , and so on . We will end up postponing all life saving to the indefinite future , which never comes . So we will end up saving no lives at all . If life saving produces constant wellbeing , and yet its price declines with time , this is the conclusion we must draw . But it is a ridiculous one . We have a paradox . Here is one possible solution . Life saving may not be a constant-wellbeing commodity after all . Undoubtedly , saving some people 's lives adds more wellbeing to the world than saving other people 's . Saving a twentyyear-old with a long and happy future ahead of her adds more to wellbeing than saving a ninety-year-old with little left to look forward to . We may expect that , by and large , a society will first direct its resources to saving the people with most wellbeing to gain . As it progresses in its ability to save lives , it will start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the future , therefore , where more lives are being saved , life saving will , by and large , produce less wellbeing at the margin . Therefore , the more life saving is deferred to the future , the less wellbeing it will produce on average at the margin . Eventually , as life saving is deferred , there will come a point where the lower price of future life saving is matched by its lower benefit in terms of wellbeing . After that , it would be wrong to defer any more life saving . At that point , future life saving is on average genuinely less valuable than present life saving . Life saving should then be discounted . // It is possible that we are in this position already . If we are , life saving is not a constant-wellbeing commodity , and it should be discounted . But we have no reason to think this is so , because there is no market that can be expected to make it so . We can not rely on a market interest rate . All we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving at different dates . If we conclude that life saving will lead to the same amount of wellbeing at every date , as I assumed earlier , it should not be discounted . The same goes for saving people from deformities. 4.7 Disenfranchised generations My second objection is that for many projects most of the interested parties are not represented in the market . Many projects will affect future generations for centuries or millennia ahead . Nuclear waste will remain dangerous for many thousands of years , and projects for disposing of it must take account of that . Attempts to control global warming will bring their main benefits more than a century from now . But the only people whose values are registered in market prices are those who are alive now . This is surely a very serious gap in the market price method . One thing might lead you to think not . I suggested in section 4.4 that the main determinant of interest rates is the economy 's technology , specifically its fertility . If this is correct , then interest rates would not be much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to be represented in the market . Imagine a trust for future generations was set up , able to borrow money against the potential earnings of future generations , and empowered to buy resources for their use . Once the economy settled down to a new equilibrium , interest rates would not have changed much . So is the disenfranchisement of future generations a significant fault in the market price method of evaluation , or is it not ? If enfranchisement would not make much difference to interest rates , surely not : the market price method uses interest rates that are about correct . But actually this reasoning is erroneous . Interest rates would be about the same in the new equilibrium , after the economy has settled down . But just after the new trust was set up , the economy would be very far from equilibrium . From the trust 's point of view ? representing future generations ? future commodities would be much more valuable than they seem to us who are participating in the market now . ' The trust-would use its funds to transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up future commodities , making them more expensive and reducing their own interest rates . When the new equilibrium was achieved , their prices would drop again to their original level , and interest rates would be restored . But in the meantime many resources would have been transferred away from us for the use of future generations . It is // // only the disenfranchisement of future generations that gives us the share of the world 's resources that we have . With things as they are , then , in our present equilibrium , if we came to take account of the interests of future generations , we would use lower interest rates . We would discount the future less than we do now in the market . If public authorities took account of the interests of future generations , they would use lower interest rates than market rates in their decision making . This would have the effect of transferring resources forward in time for the use of future people . Should public authorities act this way ? The welfare economist A. C. Pigou thought they should . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State should protect the interests of the future in some degree against the effects of our irrational discounting and of our preference for ourselves over our descendants . The whole movement for conservation ' in the United States is based on this conviction . It is the clear duty of Government , which is the trustee for unborn generations as well as for its present citizens , to watch over , and , if need be , by legislative enactment , to defend , the exhaustible natural resources of the country from rash and reckless spoliation.18 On the other hand , some people think a public authority should adopt the values of its constituents . In a democracy , they think , public authorities are responsible to their electorate , which does not include generations not yet born . No doubt the present generation cares about future generations to some extent , and wishes to leave resources for their use . The value the present generation attaches to the wellbeing of future generations will have been embodied in present interest rates , and it would be wrong to give any further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He says : I want the government 's social welfare function to reflect only the preferences of present individuals . Whatever else democratic theory may or may not imply , I consider it axiomatic that a democratic government reflects only the preferences of the individuals who are presently members of the body politic.19 Marglin and Pigou are arguing about what the job of a government is ? an argument in political philosophy that I do not wish to join in . I shall say something else instead.20 Besides the question of what a government ought to do , there is the separate question of which of its actions would have the best results . It is quite possible that the action a government ought to take is not the one that would have the best results . For instance , a government might have a duty to do what its electorate wants , and its electorate might want it to do something that would not have the best results . In this chapter I am concentrating on the question of what would have the best results . That was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid out was to compare alternative distributions of wellbeing across present and future people , to decide which is better . The market price method of evaluation came up as a possible short cut towards achieving this aim . It was intended to avoid the very difficult process of comparing people 's wellbeing directry , but was still meant to determine which distribution of wellbeing is better , weighing together the wellbeing of different people at different times . Marglin sug gests , though , that a government 's social welfare function ' should reflect only the preferences of the individuals who are presently members of the body politic . His reason is that he sees the social welfare function as playing a particular role in a democratic political process : helping to determine what a government ought to do . He does not suggest that the social welfare function measures the actual value of the alternative distributions . So his aim is different from the one I have been pursuing in this chapter . I have been looking for a way of aggregating people 's wellbeing to determine the overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wellbeing of future generations needs to be included . 4.8 Imprudence Market prices indicate the relative values people set on different commod ities . In section 4.3 , I discussed what values ' means in this context . I said that , if a person aims to maximize her wellbeing , the value of a commodity to her is the wellbeing she will derive from it . If people generally aim to maximize their wellbeing , then , market prices will indicate what wellbeing people expect to get from commodities . Prices will be some sort of a measure of wellbeing , and the market price method of evaluation has some chance of approximating the pure method . But if people do not aim to maximize their wellbeing , this will not be so . Imprudence is an important instance . When I say a person is imprudent , I mean she discounts her own future wellbeing ; she does not attach as much value to her future wellbeing as she does to her present wellbeing . Figure 4.3 shows indifference curves for an imprudent person . In the example I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent cheaper than present wine . In equilibrium the person must adjust her relative values to prices . She there-fore values future wine 5 per cent less than present wine , at the margin . But that does not mean an extra bottle of wine in the future would bring her 5 per cent less wellbeing than an extra bottle in the present . As it happens , in the example I assumed , it would bring her exactly the same wellbeing . So although future wine is discounted by 5 per cent on the market , it does not bring 5 per cent less wellbeing . The discount rate does not measure well-being . // In general , if people are imprudent , the market prices of commodities will not properly represent the commodities ' effects on wellbeing . The market price method of evaluation will therefore not correctly indicate the results that would be reached by the pure method . Market interest rates will discount the future too quickly . What is to be done about this ? In section 4.3 , I said that many economists would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is up to them . It is not the job of a public authority to overrule people 's own decision making in these matters . So imprudence gives no reason to use a lower discount rate on commodities than the market 's rate . Many economists believe that , if people are imprudent , this is a reason for the government to be imprudent too . On the other hand , Pigou thought otherwise . In the passage I quoted in section 4.7 , he says the government should protect the interests of the future , not only against our preference for ourselves over future generations , but also against our own irrational discounting ' . Once again , I shall decline to enter an argument about the job of the government ; that is a matter for political theory . In this chapter , I have been asking what action would have the best result . The pure method of evaluation was intended to answer this question , and the market price method was intended as a short cut to the pure method . If people are imprudent , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because market prices will not measure people 's wellbeing . Market interest rates will not correctly indicate which action will have the best results . The practical importance of this point depends on whether people are typically imprudent . I know of no convincing evidence about that , one way or the other.2 ' But it is theoretically important for the following reason . In section 4.4 , I explained that , for reasons of technology , future commodities would generally be cheaper in the market than present ones . This implies that consumers , when they are in equilibrium , must value future commodities less than present ones at the margin . I asked how that could happen , and I mentioned only two possible explanations of importance . The first is that the person might plan to consume more commodities in the future than in the present . This makes future commodities less valuable to her at the margin , because of their diminishing marginal value . Extra commodities will bring her less wellbeing in the future than in the present . So in this case future commodities ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market interest rates constitute a genuine reason for discounting . But this case can occur only if the person is increasing her consumption over time . It can occur in a society generally only if the economy is growing , so that people 's consumption is generally increasing . In a static economy , this can not be the explanation of why people value future commodities less than present ones . In a static economy , only the // second possible explanation is available , and that is imprudence . But if imprudence is the explanation , the fact that interest rates are positive in the market does not indicate that present commodities produce more wellbeing than future commodities . If wellbeing ought not to be discounted , market interest rates do not then give us a good reason for discounting commodities in public decisions . When it comes down to it , if wellbeing ought not to be discounted , the only justification there can be for discounting commodities is that future commodities produce less wellbeing than present ones . And that will only plausibly be the case if people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , technology will almost always ensure that interest rates are positive , but these positive rates will justify discounting only if the economy is growing . This is a severe limitation on our right to discount future commodities . 4.9 Conclusion Within the market price method of evaluation , there are some good grounds for discounting future commodities . The method itself has its attractions , and it is much more practical than the pure method . But there are also some sound objections to the market price method . The most serious is that it does not take proper account of the wellbeing of future generations . We can not put our faith in the market price method in circumstances where the objections are important . It is certainly unreliable for evaluating long-term projects that have large effects on future generations . For instance , it is useless for projects aimed at mitigating global warming . For these projects I think we have no alternative but to fall back on the pure method ; no short cut is available . We shall have to do our best to estimate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then we shall have to decide whether future wellbeing should be discounted . I have avoided that question in this chapter . The market price method skirts around it , by fixing attention on the discounting of commodities . But it can not be avoided in the end.22 5 Can a Humean be moderate ? 5.1 Moderate and extreme Humeans A Humean believes that no preference can be irrational . It is not irrational to prefer the destruction of the world to the scratching of your little finger , or your own acknowledged lesser good to your greater . An extreme Humean leaves it at that . A moderate Humean adds a qualification . Although , she says , no individual preference can be irrational on its own , some patterns of preferences are irrational ; there are some sets of preferences that a person can not rationally have together . Rationality , then , does constrain preferences to some extent . Moderate Humeans recognize two types of constraint on preferences . One is the connection between preferences about means and preferences about ends . Suppose an action A will bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you prefer the result of A to the result of B , and you have no intrinsic preference between A and B. Then it is irrational for you to prefer B to A. The other type of constraint is consistency . Moderate Humeans recog nize various consistency constraints . One is transitivity : if you prefer an alternative A to B and you prefer B to C , then it is irrational for you to prefer C to A. There are other consistency constraints too . Decision theory is generally taken to encapsulate them . Decision theory consists of a number of axioms defined on a person 's preferences . Transitivity is one , and there are several others . Each is intended to specify a consistency constraint on the preferences . ) A rational person is supposed to have preferences that conform to the axioms . These two types of constraint on preferences really come down to one : consistency constraints subsume means ? ends constraints . Indeed , the main 68 // point of decision theory is to make clear the nature of means ? ends constraints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires between a person 's preferences about ends and her preferences about means . I described this connection just now , but my description was rough and inadequate . For one thing , I mentioned an intrinsic preference ' without explaining precisely what that means . And , secondly , things are almost never as straightforward as I implied . You can almost never be sure what the result of an action will be ; it might be one thing , or something else . Furthermore , the result , whatever it is , will almost certainly be complex . It will almost certainly not be the achievement of some simple end that you want ; it will have some features you want and others you do not want . Forming a rational preference between two actions will therefore be a matter of weighing some goods against some bads , and of weighing the probabilities of some results against the probabilities of others . In this , you will be working back from preferences about ends to preferences about means , but the process will not be a simple one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducts the complex weighing up that is involved . The moderate Humean view , then , comes down to this . You may , rationally , have any preferences , provided only that they are consistent with each other . And what consistency requires is spelt out in decision theory . The extreme Humean view is unappealing . It implies that reason leaves people unequipped for life . For one thing , it leaves them a defenceless prey to Dutch bookmakers , money pump operators , and suchlike sharks.2 But that is the tip of the iceberg . The extreme Humean view implies that reason can not guide people even through the most ordinary business of living . When you want a hot shower rather than a cold one , rationality will not even direct you to prefer to turn on the hot tap rather than the cold one . A moderate Humean wants to avoid this conclusion . She wants to allow reason a role in guiding people through life ; she wants it to help determine and modify their preferences . But she still wants the ultimate basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some preferences can give rational grounds for others . When a person has some particular preferences , reason will require her to have other particular preferences . So the person may have a reason to have some particular preference ? and if she does not have it she will be irrational ? but the reason will always derive from her other preferences . A moderate Humean respects the fundamental Humean principle that a reason must always derive from a-preference . But she supplements this principle with some requirements of instrumental rationality ' , as they are often called . When a person has preferences that are inconsistent with one another , reason requires her to alter some of them , though it does not determine which . The moderate // Humean thinks of decision theory as ( in Richard Jeffrey 's words ) a sort of Logic of Decision which individuals can use as an anvil against which to form and reform parts of their preference rankings ' .3 But in this chapter , I shall argue that the moderate Humean position can not really be held apart from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Humean view as a whole . 5.2 A difficulty facing moderate Humeans The details of decision theory are not universally agreed . Different versions have different axioms . But they do all agree at least on the axiom of transitivity . Transitivity is a minimal condition of consistency ; if consistency does not require transitivity , it requires nothing.4 So we may take it that all moderate Humeans believe rationality requires a person to have transitive preferences . A Humean who does not insist on transitivity is extreme , not moderate . For this reason , I shall concentrate on the transitivity axiom in my argument . It is an interesting question how a moderate Humean might defend the requirement of transitivity . But that is not the subject of this chapter . I am not concerned with the grounds of the moderate Humean 's view , but with whether her view is significantly different from an extreme Humean 's . Think about this example . Maurice , given a choice between going mountaineering in the Alps and visiting Rome , prefers to visit Rome . Given a choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay at home . But given a choice between staying at home and going mountaineering , he prefers to go mountaineering . Maurice 's preferences seem to be intransitive , and therefore irrational . But Maurice has a defence against the charge of irrationality . In describing his preferences , I distinguished only three alternatives : mountaineering , Rome , and home . Maurice , however , distinguishes four : H , . : Maurice stays at home , when going to Rome was the only other alternative available . R : Maurice goes to Rome . M : Maurice goes mountaineering . H , , , : Maurice stays at home , when mountaineering was the only other alternative available . He points out that transitivity requires him to prefer H , to M , given that he prefers H , to R and R to M. But the choice between staying at home and going mountaineering is a choice between Hm and M , and nothing requires him to prefer H , , , to M. Maurice 's defence , then , is to refine the individuation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes what Maurice would choose if offered a choice between all three alternatives at once . But it adds a complication worth mentioning . Suppose he would choose Rome . This suggests he does not prefer home to Rome , though I said earlier that he did . So it suggests that Maurice 's preferences vary according to what alternatives are on offer . ' This , like intransitivity , is contrary to the consistency conditions of decision theory . But Maurice can obviously handle this problem in the way he handles intransitivity . He can individuate the alternatives taking account of the choice on offer . He can treat Hr ? staying at home when Rome was the only other alternative ? as different from staying at home when both Rome and mountaineering were available . This will allow him to arrange his preferences in one big , unvarying order . ' Since the same device of fine individuation works for both problems , I shall continue to concentrate on apparent intransitivity . Maurice 's defence is available to anyone who has apparently intransitive preferences . Suppose someone , faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faced with a choice between B and C , she prefers B. And faced with a choice between C and A , she prefers C. These preferences seem intransitive . But let us individuate the alternatives more finely . Let us write A when B was the only other alternative available ' as Ab , B when A was the only other alternative available ' as Ba , and so on . Then this person prefers Ab to Ba , B , to Cb and Ca to A , . And there is no intransitivity in that . It seems , then , that the requirement of transitivity is really no constraint on preferences at all . Fine individuation of alternatives will always allow a person to wriggle out of it . That is an overstatement , however . Transitivity does constrain Maurice 's preferences , despite his fine individuation . Because Maurice prefers Hr to R , and R to M , transitivity requires him to prefer Hr to M. This is a constraint on his preferences . To be sure , Hr and M are not a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he was to have a choice between staying at home and going mountaineering , that would be a choice between Hm and M , not between Hr and M. Let us call one of a person 's preferences practical if it is a preference between a pair of alternatives that the person could have a choice between . Then Maurice 's preference for M over Hm is practical , but his preference for H. over M is nonpractical . The truth about fine individuation is this . It means that a person 's practical preferences are not constrained by transitivity . Transitivity imposes constraints on a person 's complete pattern of preferences , including her nonpractical ones . But her practical preferences form only a part of her complete pattern of preferences , and these practical preferences can have any pattern at all without conflicting with transitivity . For the sake of precision , I neeito say more about this conclusion . Take // the person who prefers A to B , B to C , and C to A. Under fine individuation , she prefers Ab to Ba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consequently , transitivity requires this of her : either she prefers Ab to Ae , or she prefers Bc to Bu , or she prefers Ca to Ch.7 So if my claim that transitivity does not constrain practical preferences is to be correct , then a preference between Ab and Ac , and other preferences of that sort , can not be counted as practical preferences . Yet , at first sight , it may look as if the person might actually have a choice between Ab and She might be presented with this choice : would you like to have a choice between A and B , or alternatively a choice between A and C ? If she decides in advance that , whichever of these alternatives she chooses , she will choose A in her subsequent choice , then this may look like a choice between Ab and A , between A when the only other alternative available was B , and A when the only other alternative available was C. But this is not really a plausible interpretation of the choice the person is faced with , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , B , and C. In any case , I do not mean Ab and A , to be understood in such a way that the choice I described counts as a choice between Ab and A , . Nor is there any other way a person could have a choice between Ab and A , . So a preference between these alternatives is indeed nonpractical . Consider Maurice again . Implicitly I have been assuming he is indifferent between Rh and R , n , and also between Mr and Mh . Transitivity consequently requires him to prefer H , . to H. And this is a nonpractical preference ; Maurice could not have a choice between Hr and Transitivity , then , does not constrain practical preferences . And it turns out that none of the other consistency axioms of decision theory constrains practical preferences either . All of them yield to similar treatment by fine individuation . This point is well recognized when applied to the sure-thing principle ' , the central axiom of Leonard Savage 's decision theory . ' It has often been argued that rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure-thing principle ; 9 many plausible examples have been produced of preferences that seem rational but do not conform . But it has also been recognized for a long time that these examples can be brought into conformity with the sure-thing principle by means of fine individuation , just as Maurice 's preferences can be brought into conformity with transitivity . Fine individuation , then , can be used to defend the sure-thing principle against the examples . However , it has been recognized for just as long that fine individuation leaves the sure-thing principle empty ' ( which seems to make it an unsatisfactory defence ) .10 What this means , precisely , is that the sure-thing principle does not constrain practical preferences . I do not need to go into the details here . ' ' The conclusion is that , because of the possibility of fine individuation , the consistency conditions on preferences do not actually constrain practical preferences at all . // This is a difficulty for the moderate Humean . She wants rationality to guide a person in her practical affairs . But she supposes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns out that in practical matters ? between alternatives the person might have a choice between ? consistency does not guide her preferences at all . 5.3 A Non-Humean response What inference should we draw ? Let us consider whether Maurice is really rational . Has he really justified his preferences by insisting on fine individuation ? Certainly not by that alone . If we thought him irrational to begin with , because of his apparently intransitive preferences , we shall not revise our view just because he points out the formal possibility of individuating the alternatives more finely . He will have to do better than that . Having distinguished H , . from Hm , Maurice puts them in different places in his preference ordering . And this is what he will have to justify to us . He will have to justify his preference between H , . and H . Perhaps he can . Suppose the explanation of Maurice 's preferences is this . He is frightened of heights , and therefore he would rather go to Rome than go mountaineering . Sightseeing bores him , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Rome . But Maurice sees a choice of staying at home and undertaking a mountaineering trip as a test of his courage . He believes it would be cowardly to stay at home , and that is why he prefers to go mountaineering . ( He considers it cultured , not cowardly , to visit Rome . ) Is this enough to show that Maurice is rational ? I do not know , but I do know what it depends on . If we are to conclude that Maurice is rational , what shall we have to say ? We shall have to say he has produced an adequate reason that one involves cowardice and the other does not ? for placing H , n and H , in different positions in his preference ordering . If , on the other hand , we are to conclude Maurice is irrational , we shall have to deny this . We shall have to say that he has not shown a difference between these two alternatives that is adequate to justify his having a preference between them . Maurice is rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference between H , and Presumably we shall take the view that Maurice is irrational only if we think he is wrong about cowardice , and that actually there is nothing cowardly about staying at home rather than mountaineering . Even if we think this , it would perhaps be unfair to condemn Maurice for irrationality . His preferences stem front a false belief , and there may be nothing irrational about having a false belief . His prefereues will be mistaken in a sense , and // we might perhaps say they are objectively irrational , but not subjectively so . Furthermore , even if Maurice is wrong about cowardice , we might concede that his preferences are not irrational in any sense . They will not be irrational if , because of his incorrect views about cowardice , staying at home will make Maurice feel bad , or if it will make him lose his self-respect . Preserving his self-respect and avoiding a bad feeling are presumably themselves sufficient reasons to justify Maurice 's preference for mountaineering , quite apart from the matter of actual cowardice . But in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except on the grounds that he is not justified in having a preference between H , and H , n . So long as it is rational for these two alternatives to occupy different places in his preference ordering , Maurice 's preferences are rational . To convict him , we shall have to insist on a rational principle of indifference . We shall have to say that the difference between H , and H , , , is not enough to justify Maurice in having a preference between the two : rationality requires him to be indifferent between these alternatives . This rational principle , together with transitivity , is enough to bring home the charge . The rational principle requires him to be indifferent between H , . and Hm , and transitivity requires him to prefer H , to M. Together they require him to prefer H , , , to M , and actually he does not . It might be thought that a quite different argument can show Maurice 's preferences to be irrational . It seems that a money pump could be operated against Maurice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces . Suppose he has a ticket to Rome . You offer to exchange it , at a small price , for a certificate to stay at home . Maurice will accept . Next you offer to exchange the certificate , at a small price , for a mountaineering ticket . Again Maurice will accept . Finally , you offer to exchange the mountaineering ticket for a ticket to Rome , at a small price . Once more , Maurice will accept . So he will end up where he started , but poorer . If Maurice can be milked in this way , that is popularly supposed to show his preference are irrational . A money-pump argument may or may not be effective in general ; that is no concern of mine in this chapter . But it certainly can not succeed in this case . For one thing , it proves too much . If it works at all , it will work even if Maurice is right about cowardice , and fully justified in his preferences . But then his preferences are rational , so there must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it is plain what is wrong with it . Suppose Maurice is right . And suppose he is now planning to stay at home , having turned down a trip to Rome . Then , if you come and offer him a mountaineering trip , you are by that very action making him worse off . You are , in effect , moving him from H. to H , , , , which is justifiably lower in his preference ordering . Maurice is willing to buy his way out of this posiCan // tion . It is as though you stole his shirt and then sold it back to him . Rationality can not protect Maurice from that sort of sharp practice . So the fact that he is susceptible to it is no evidence of irrationality . The moneypump argument fails , then . To generalize the conclusion I have drawn : there must be such things as rational principles of indifference ; rationality must determine that some differences between alternatives are not enough to justify a person in preferring one of the alternatives to the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not , then rationality would not constrain practical preferences at all . Consistency conditions on their own ( transitivity and the other conditions too ) can not constrain them . Rational principles of indifference are needed to give consistency a grip on practical preferences . These rational principles must be concrete and specific , not formal and general like the consistency conditions . They must determine which specific differences between alternatives are not enough to justify a preference . I am happy with the conclusion that there must be rational principles of indifference . Here is a plausible one , for instance : the mere difference that in Hr Maurice has not rejected a mountaineering trip whereas in H , , , he has is not enough to justify Maurice in having a preference between Hr and H , , , . If he is to be justified in his preference , there must be some other difference as well . The other difference Maurice claims is that one involves cowardice and the other does not . If Maurice can not establish the existence of a justifying difference like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not rational to have a preference between two alternatives unless they differ in some good or bad respect.12 The view that there are concrete rational principles of indifference is not at all unusual . Some ethical theories imply very restrictive principles . Jeremy Bentham , for instance , seems to have believed that pleasure is the only good , and pain the only bad . Consequently , he would presumably have believed that if each of two alternatives gives everybody the same pleasure , and everybody the same pain , it is not rational to have a preference between the two . 5.4 A Humean response A Humean , on the other hand , can not be happy with the conclusion that there must be rational principles of indifference . Such a principle denies that certain specific preferences are rational , which is something a Humean can not allow . She can not allow that rationality should ever deny a person the right to prefer anything to anything else , provided this preference is consistent with her other preferences . // A Humean must therefore pay the penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constrain practical preferences . At first it looked as though the consistency conditions of rationality constrained them . But actually consistency conditions can not do so without the support of rational principles of indifference . And those the Humean can not acknowledge . How severe is this penalty ? Does it completely undermine the position of a moderate Humean ? An extreme Humean believes that rationality allows a person to have any pattern of preferences whatsoever . Even a moderate Humean , we now see , has to believe that rationality allows a person to have any pattern of practical preferences whatsoever . So can she hold herself apart from an extreme Humean ? She can certainly defend her position . In discussing Maurice , I have been considering the constraints of rationality from the outside . I asked whether we could or could not convict Maurice of irrationality . The answer is that , if we are Humeans , we never could . Nor could we convict anyone else , however strange her practical preferences . But a moderate Humean is not interested in rationality as a criterion for condemning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a guide that helps people conduct their own affairs . So am I , of course.13 The talk about condemnation was only metaphorical . I had in mind that Maurice could ask himself , Am I really being rational in preferring Hr to H ? ' He could ask himself , that is , whether some rational principle of indifference requires him to be indifferent between Hr and H , , , . If he concludes that this preference is not rational , then he should adjust his practical preferences . This is how I see rationality guiding him . But the moderate Humean will point out that , when a person is beating out her preferences on the anvil of decision theory , she has access to all of her preferences , not just the practical ones . The consistency conditions certainly constrain all of her preferences taken together . The person may consistently have any pattern of practical preferences at all , but the pattern of her practical preferences will , by consistency , determine a lot about her nonpractical preferences . Maurice , given the practical preferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , , , for instance , or else Mh , to Mr or R , , , to Rh . Conversely , if he has none of these nonpractical preferences , he ought not to have the practical preferences he does have . If he finds himself in this position , reason requires him to change some of his preferences , and he may change one of his practical ones . In this way , the consistency constraints , applied to the whole pattern of a person 's preferences , may have practical effects . If a person has a particular pattern of nonpractical preferences , then the consistency conditions will limit the practical preferences she may have . According to a moderate Humean , then , reason may guide Maurice in forming his practical preferences as follows . Maurice can ask himself , Do // I really prefer Hr to Hm ? ' If he concludes that he does not , reason will bring him to adjust his practical preferences . From the inside , Maurice does not need to ask whether it is rational for him to prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational principle of indifference is needed . He only needs to ask whether actually he has this preference . If he does not , that gives him a reason to alter his practical preferences . In general , then , people 's preferences are not entirely unconstrained by consistency , and the requirement of consistency may have an influence even over their practical preferences . On the basis of their nonpractical preferences , consistency may help to determine the pattern of their practical preferences . So the moderate Humean has a position that is still distinct from the extreme one . That is her argument . 5.5 The nature and epistemology of preferences I shall try to show that this argument is unsuccessful . A moderate Humean requires practical preferences to be determined or influenced by reasoning based on nonpractical preferences . One possible response would be to deny that nonpractical preferences even exist : if you can not have a choice , one might say , you can not have a preference either . If that were so , the moderate Humean would obviously have no , leg to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I think people do , indeed , have nonpractical preferences . My own response , put roughly , will be that , although nonpractical preferences exist , they do not have enough independent substance to serve the moderate Humean 's purposes . We are not able to reason from them to determine practical preferences in the way the moderate Humean requires . What , exactly , is it for someone to have a nonpractical preference ? If someone prefers A to B , where A and B are such that she could not have a choice between them , what does this amount to ? We shall see that nonpractical preferences raise special difficulties . But let us start by asking the same question about preferences in general . What is it for a person to have a preference ? The notion of preference is a flexible one , and several different concepts may be collected under the same name . But for our purposes we can restrict the concept by at least two conditions that preferences must satisfy . The first is that a person must be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some concept of preference ( a Freudian one , perhaps ) such that we can not know what our preferences are . But if so , this is not the concept a moderate Humean has in mind . A moderate Humean requires a person to be able to reson on the basis of her preferences to determine what other preferences she should have . Consequently , since preferences play a part in the person 's reasoning , she must be , able to know what they // are . Our account of preferences must therefore supply a satisfactory explanation of how a person can come to know her preferences . This condition , I think , provides the best approach to the concept of preference . By asking How can we know what our preferences are ? ' , we can discover what our concept of preference is . The second condition we require preferences to meet is this . It must genuinely be a condition of rationality that a person 's preferences should conform to the consistency requirements of decision theory ? transitivity in particular . We must understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think this condition provides a serious constraint on the notion of preferences , because if preferences are conceived in some popular ways ( as feelings , for instance ) it is very hard to see why rationality should require them to be transitive . I suspect that this condition could contribute extra support to the conclusions of this chapter . However , I shall actually make no use of it . The reason is that I could not use it without first settling what are the grounds of the consistency conditions , and I do not want to do that . This chapter , as I said earlier , is not about the grounds of the moderate Humean 's position . It is about whether the moderate Humean has a distinct position at all . So I shall rely on the first condition only . Some sort of functionalist account of preference seems very natural ? an account like this : a person prefers A to B if and only if she is in a state that typically has the following functional role ... 14 Then the typical functional role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not difficult . At least a major part of the typical functional role of a practical preference is to dispose the person to choose the preferred alternative , if she has a choice . This account provides a ready explanation of how we can know our own practical preferences and other people 's . There is a canonical test of a person 's preferences : to see what she chooses when she has a choice.15 In principle , a person can apply this test to herself , to discover her own preferences . In practice , however , the canonical test is often not available , because the subject never faces the appropriate choice . And in any case , even when it is available , it is often not the most natural test for a person to apply to herself . But I shall not discuss alternative tests now ; it will be most convenient to postpone that discussion to section 5.8 . A functionalist account may be available for nonpractical preferences too . But for a nonpractical preference , a disposition to choose A over B can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not have a choice between A and B.16 So what is the functional role of a nonpractical preference ? More generally : what is it to have a nonpractical preference ? To answer , let us examine the ways we may come to know what our nonpractical preferences are . // 5.6 Knowing preferences by perception How does a person come to know her nonpractical preferences ? I can think of three answers that might be given . First of all , preferences might be directly perceptible in some way . Start with practical preferences . These can be independently identified by th'ir tendency to determine choices . But suppose they can also be perceived directly . Suppose , for instance , that , if I scratch statements expressing two propositions in the dust around my feet , and then stand between them , I generally find myself leaning towards the one I prefer . Or suppose that , when I call to mind two propositions , I generally feel drawn to the one I prefer . Then we might take it as part of the functional role of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should certainly do so if the leanings or feelings themselves played a causal role in my choices . Suppose that when I am faced with a choice , I contemplate the alternatives , feel drawn to one of them , and , as a result of that , make my choice . Then bringing about the feeling would undoubtedly count as one of the functional roles that identify a preference . And now suppose I have these leanings or feelings even between alternatives that I could not have a choice between . Then the leanings or feelings might well be enough to determine that I have a preference between the alternatives , and what my preference is . This would be a nonpractical preference . I would have a nonpractical preference between A and B , then , if and only if I am in a state that typically brings it about that I lean towards A when I stand between expressions of A and B scratched in the dust , or I feel drawn towards A when I contemplate A and B. So this could be what it is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain how I can come to know my nonpractical preferences . I have only to observe my leanings or feelings . If human nature was like this , the moderate Humean 's argument would be sound . Maurice would be able to consult his leanings or feelings to determine whether or not he prefers H , . to H , , , , or MI , to M , , or R , , , to Rh . If he finds he does not , rationality would require him to make an adjustment in his preferences . We could draw the same conclusion if a person had perceptible degrees of desire , rather than perceptible preferences . In this case the argument happens to be more complicated , but the complication makes no significant difference . Suppose I could call an alternative to mind , and by an inward glance determine how much I desire it . Suppose this works in such a way that , of two alternative 's , I prefer the one an inward glance reveals I desire more . ( So for practical preferences , which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispr4ition to choose . ) Then I // could determine my preferences by inward glances . The complication is this . If , for each proposition , there is a degree to which I desire it , then my preferences are necessarily transitive . If the degree to which I desire A is greater than the degree to which I desire B , and the degree to which I desire B is greater than the degree to which I desire C , then necessarily the degree to which I desire A is greater than the degree to which I desire C. So , if I prefer A to B , and I prefer B to C , then necessarily I prefer A to C. Consequently , there can be no conflict on grounds of transitivity between my practical preferences and my nonpractical preferences . If Maurice has the practical preferences I described for him , then it follows that he prefers H , . to H , , , , or Mh to Mr , or R , , , to Rh . Transitivity is automatically satisfied ; it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be other rational constraints on preferences : namely , the other consistency axioms of decision theory . It will still be possible for practical and nonpractical preferences to conflict through these other axioms . The moderate Humean 's position will still be intact , therefore ; rationality may still constrain practical preferences . The situation I have been describing is possible . It is possible that nonpractical preferences ( or degrees of desire ) might have been directly perceptible , by means of a feeling or in some other way . Certainly , it is not possible that a preference might have been a feeling . ' ? But nonpractical preferences might have been perceptible by feelings , in the way I have described . If this had been so , the moderate Humean 's position would have been distinct from the extreme Humean 's . But , although it might have been so , actually it is not . So my case against the moderate Humean is only a contingent one . She would have been right if human nature had been different from how it actually is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it happens , nonpractical preferences are not perceptible by feelings . The only evidence I have for this claim is common experience . No doubt there are some feelings associated with preference . Some desires , at least , are accompanied by feelings , such as the violent passion of resentment mentioned by Hume.18 Perhaps a person can sometimes perceive her preferences between two simple objects of desire by noticing which she feels drawn to . But we are talking about nonpractical preferences . These are inevitably between complex alternatives , which it requires some intellectual effort to understand . It is implausible that a preference between such things could be detected by a feeling . I shall later be suggesting it could be detected by a process that might be mistaken for this one : by weighing up the considerations in favour of the two alternatives . A person who is weighing up considerations could believe herself to be judging which alternative she feels drawn to . The processes are actually quite different , because one is a rational process and the other is not . But they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceal the implausibility of the view that nonpractical preferences are perceived by feelings . But in any case , I do not think much evidence is needed for my claim . It is widely accepted.19 Hume himself accepted that many desires can not be perceived by feelings . Desires , he thought , are often calm passions which , tho ' they be real passions , produce little emotion in the mind , and are more known by their effects than by the immediate feeling or sensation ' .20 5.7 Knowing preferences by their effects That was the first way a person might come to know her nonpractical preferences . In the remark of his I quoted just now , Hume suggests a second way : she might come to know them by their effects . He means their outward effects , as opposed to the feelings they generate . What are these effects ? The primary outward effect of a practical preference is to dispose a person to make a particular choice . A nonpractical preference is more remote from choice , but we can identify an outward effect nonetheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that limits the practical preferences it is rational for her to have . Since people are typically rational , it therefore typically limits the practical preferences a person will have . Consequently , a person 's nonpractical preferences can be identified through her practical preferences . From Maurice 's practical preferences as I described them , we can tell something about his nonpractical preferences . At least if he is rational , either he prefers H , , to H , , , , or R , , , to Rh , or Mh to Mr. This way of identifying a person 's nonpractical preferences is available to other people besides the one whose preferences they are . For someone else to identify my nonpractical preferences by this method , she must first identify my practical preferences by somehow discovering my dispositions to choose , and then work back from there . But Hume had in mind that I would come to know my own preferences in this way : from their effects . So I , too , would work back from my own dispositions to choose . How would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems I have an advantage over other people . I can simply present myself with the choice in my imagination , and see what I decide . Applying Hume 's idea to nonpractical preferences raises a difficulty , though . The idea is that a person 's practical preferences are causally affected by her nonpractical preferences , and the effects identify these nonpractical preferences . This gives us a functionalist conception of nonpractical preferences : I have a particular nonpractical preference if and only if I am in a state that typically brings it about that my practical preferences have such-and-such a pattern . But why should we , believe that there is such // a state ? Why should we think that practical preferences are in any way affected by a separate range of preferences , the nonpractical ones ? Usually , when we identify a mental state by means of its causal functions , we have separate grounds for thinking there is some causal process , of the appropriate sort , at work . A practical preference , for instance , is that mental state , whatever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she makes . And we have grounds for thinking that some mental state causes her choices . Consequently , although a practical preference is identified by the person 's dispositions to choose , we have grounds for thinking it is actually something distinct from the disposition . But if a nonpractical preference is to be identified on the basis of practical preferences , we have no grounds for thinking that the state of having a nonpractical preference will be anything different from the state of having practical preferences of a particular form . A moderate Humean needs a person to be able to reason from her nonpractical preferences to determine , on grounds of consistency , what her practical preferences should be . For this to be possible , her nonpractical preferences must be distinct from her practical preferences . Yet I have just said that , if she identifies her nonpractical preferences by Hume 's method , there is no reason to think they will be distinct . Furthermore , even if they are distinct , they will have been identified from her practical preferences on the assumption that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could not possibly give her a reason , on grounds of consistency , for having practical preferences that are different from the ones she actually has . This difficulty is only the reflection of a much more fundamental objection : a general objection to Hume 's suggestion that a passion might be known by its effects . Hume , given the part he assigned to passions in rationality , ought never to have made this suggestion . He clearly meant that a person might know of one of her own passions by its effects . And the effects he had in mind were , evidently , the person 's acting in accordance with the passion ? doing things that satisfy it . But according to his own theory , these effects are mostly produced by the application of reason to the passion . We cast our view on every side , he thought , and discover by reasoning whatever objects are connected to the original object of our passion by the relation of cause and effect . So according as our reasoning varies , our actions receive a subsequent variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , are mediated by reason . A person , however , can not apply reason in this way unless she already knows what her passion is . Therefore , she can not know her passion by its effects . The moderate Humean is particularly concerned to explain how reason can guide action . Consequently , she particularly can not use this account of how we come to know our preferences . // 5.8 Knowing preferences by evaluation Now the third answer to the question of how a person can come to know her nonpractical preferences . This is the one I favour . Suppose A and B are a pair of alternatives that a person could not have a choice between , so her preference between them is nonpractical . I suggest that she finds out which she prefers by estimating the relative goodness of A and B. I suggest that she prefers A to B if and only if she estimates the goodness of A higher than she estimates the goodness of B. This is expressed a little awkwardly . It would be easier to say : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes A to be better than B. But David Lewis has shown that can not be correct.22 Lewis believes that his demonstration refutes the opinions of an Anti-Humean . In another paper , 23 however , I have argued that it does less than that . It shows only that an Anti-Humean ( and everyone else , too ) has to be careful about how she expresses her opinions . Preferences do not go by beliefs in degrees of good , but by expectations of good , and expectations can not be identified with beliefs . My proposal about the nature of nonpractical preferences , set out more strictly , is that a person prefers A to B ( where this preference is nonpractical ) if and only if A has , according to her probabilities , the greater expectation of good . But the details of the formulation make no difference to this chapter . And , although an expectation is not a belief , it is compounded out of beliefs . It is in the same ballpark as a belief . So the epistemology of nonpractical preferences , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The process of finding out what one 's preferences are is like the process of finding out what one 's beliefs are . In particular , it is like other matters of estimation : would you say this plate or that teacup is the older ? ; would you estimate the standard of living to be higher in Germany or Sweden ? To answer such questions , you consider the evidence and arguments available to you , and weigh them up as best you can . Maurice , similarly , must ask himself : Is Hr really better than H , n ? ' This will require him to consider whether or not H , , , really involves cowardice , whether cowardice is really bad , or whether perhaps the two alternatives are equally good , and so on . All of this is a matter of rational evaluation . I described this process of evaluation as a process of finding out what one 's preference is . But sometimes it may be a process of acquiring a new preference . I doubt there is a definite line between these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . If it is quick and obvious , it will count as finding out , otherwise as acquisition . But even if it is acquisition , it is finding out too . At.the same time as you acquire your new preference , you will come to know what it is . Either way , evaluation brings one to a knowledge of one 's preference . // There is an obvious objection to my proposal . Suppose a person estimates the goodness of A higher than the goodness of B. They she ought to prefer A to B ; reason requires her to prefer A to B. I am proposing , also , that actually she does prefer A to B. So I am eliding the distinction between having a preference and its being the case that one ought to have a preference . Obviously , though , there is a genuine distinction here . Suppose a person estimates the goodness of not smoking higher than the goodness of smoking . Then she ought to prefer not to smoke . But she may actually prefer to smoke . That is plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n general . I am only denying it for nonpractical preferences . I have said already that a practical preference , such as a preference for smoking , can be identified by its typical functional role , which is to bring about a disposition to choose . Typically , a person who is disposed to smoke prefers to smoke . And it is plain how she , and the rest of us , know what her preference is ; the epistemology of this type of preference is clear . Then , separately , it may also happen that she estimates the goodness of not smoking above the goodness of smoking . That can clearly happen with a practical preference . But with a nonpractical preference , the difference is that we have no plausible epistemology that can bring a person to know what her preference is between alternatives , independently of how she estimates the goodness of the alternatives . That is the argument I offer for my proposal . Estimating goodness is , so far as I can see , the only way we have of coming to know our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each , if it had been successful , would have supported a different concept of preference from the one I am proposing . But neither is successful . Consequently , we have to conclude that to have a nonpractical preference for A over B is nothing other than to estimate A as better than B. There is something more to say about smoking . To be sure , a person who is disposed to smoke prefers to smoke . But , if she estimates the goodness of not smoking above the goodness of smoking , it would also be natural to say she prefers not to smoke . She prefers not to smoke but , because of weakness of will , she smokes . Evidently we have two different senses of prefer ' here . We have at least two concepts of preference . According to one ? call it the evaluative ' concept ? a person prefers A to B if and only if she estimates the goodness of A above the goodness of B. According to the other ? functionalist ? concept , she prefers A to B if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads her to choose A rather than B. The functionalist concept applies only to practical preferences . But the evaluative concept applies to both practical and nonpractical preferences . That is to say , the concept I propose for nonpractical preferences can be applied to practical preferences too . // Furthermore , the epistemology of the functionalist concept is problematic even for practical preferences . Its canonical test is to see what a person chooses when she has a choice . This test can be carried out for smoking , but for many of her practical preferences a person will not actually have a choice . What can be done then ? There is the possibility I discussed earlier that a preference can be perceived , by a feeling or in some other way . But even for most practical preferences , that is not generally plausible . In practice , the best test for other people to use is generally to ask the person herself what she prefers . And the best test for her is to present herself with a choice in imagination , and see what she chooses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her running through the deliberation she would run through if faced with the choice , and forming an estimate of the goodness of the alternatives . She can then conclude she prefers the one she estimates higher . As a way of finding out what the person is disposed to choose , this test is unreliable . If she were actually to have the choice , she might choose the alternative that comes lower in her estimation , because of weakness of will . If she understands her own psychology well , she might be able to allow for her own weakness in making the imaginative test . But that allowance may well seem inappropriate to her if she is trying to find out her own preference . The process I have described , without the allowance , is an unreliable test for the functionalist concept of preference , but it is a perfectly reliable test for the evaluative concept . And when it comes to a preference that is remote from choice , the latter seems the most natural concept to apply . So I think that , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept rather than the functionalist one , even for practical preferences . Compare the conclusions of this section with Mark Johnston 's comments , in Dispositional theories of value ' , on David Lewis 's chapter with the same title . Lewis considers how a person can come to know whether a thing is valuable . His proposal is that the person should place herself in a position of full imaginative acquaintance with that thing , and see whether she values it . 1Jjy this he means : whether she desires to desire it . Lewis 's dispositional theory of value implies that , if she does , the thing is indeed valuable . Reason plays a part in the process Lewis describes : it is involved in bringing the person into full imaginative acquaintance with the object . But once she has achieved this position , it is simply a causal matter ? nothing to do with reason ? whether or not she finds herself valuing the object . " Johnston , however , argues that it is unreasonable to exclude reason at this point . I am , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the person to know that she values ? or desires to desire , the object ? I can think of no plausible answer if this state of desiring to desire is one that simply imposes itself on the person causally , as Lewis supposes . Most plausibly , a person // will find out whether she desires to desire something by considering whether she has reason to desire to desire it . This is a matter of estimating its goodness , and it is a rational process . If she judges it good , that both makes it the case that she desires to desire it , and gives her the knowledge that she does so . Indeed , it makes it the case that she desires it , in the evaluative sense of desire ' . So desiring to desire is no different from desiring in this sense . 5.9 Conclusion In section 5.4 , I suggested that reason might guide Maurice like this . He can ask himself whether it is rational for him to prefer H , . to H , , , . He might conclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be indifferent between these two alternatives . If so , he ought to change his practical preferences , because they are inconsistent with indifference between H , . and H , , , . But this story does not suit a moderate Humean . According to a moderate Humean , Maurice has only to ask himself whether he does prefer Hr to H , , , . He need not ask whether it is rational for him to do so . If he does not have this preference , then he ought to change his preferences in some way , and he may be brought to change his practical ones . Rationality guides him that way . But I have now argued in section 5.8 , on epistemological grounds , that Maurice can not really distinguish the question of whether he does have the preference from the question of whether it is rational for him to have it . To discover whether he has the preference , he will have to estimate the relative goodness of Hr and H , , , , and this is the same process as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , , . Maurice can not avoid considering the rationality of this preference . Unless he does , rationality can give him no guidance at all . This by itself may not worry a moderate Humean . A moderate Humean , unlike an extreme Humean , accepts that preferences can be irrational . So she may be willing to concede that Maurice will have to consider whether it is rational to prefer H , . to Tim . But she must insist that , if a preference is irrational , that can only be because it is inconsistent with other preferences . I said that Maurice , in considering whether it is rational to prefer H , . to H , , , , will have to consider the relative goodness of H , . and H , , , . The moderate Humean need have no objection to that . But , she will have to say , the goodness of the alternatives , from Maurice 's point of view , must itself be determined by Maurice 's preferences . When Maurice is deciding whether Hr is better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider , amongst other things , whether cowardice is really bad . But the moderate Humean will say he only // has to consider whether he prefers not to be cowardly . If he does , then , for him , H , . is better than H , n . But now the moderate Humean has come round in a circle . Her suggestion is that nonpractical preferences can be derived by principles of consistency from other preferences . These other preferences might themselves be nonpractical in the first instance . But , in the end , nonpractical preferences will have to be derived from practical ones if we are to avoid the epistemological problem I have described . So the moderate Humean 's suggestion is that nonpractical preferences are determined by consistency conditions from practical preferences . However , she started off ( in section 5.4 ) with the idea that practical preferences might be constrained , through the consistency conditions , by nonpractical preferences . This requires nonpractical preferences to be determined independently , and she has just concluded they are not . We have known since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistency , simply by other practical preferences . Consistency permits any pattern of practical preferences whatsoever . I conclude that the moderate Humean can not sustain her position . She must either become extreme or cease to be a Humean. 6 Bolker ? Jeffrey expected utility theory and axiomatic utilitarianism 6.1 Introduction In 1955 , John . Harsanyi proved a remarkable theorem . ' Assume everybody has preferences that conform to expected utility theory . Assume there are social preferences that also conform to expected utility theory . Finally , assume the social preferences satisfy the Pareto criterion . Harsanyi proved that , given these three assumptions , social preferences can be represented ( in the manner of expected utility theory ) by a utility function that is the sum of utility functions representing the preferences of the individuals . I call this the Utilitarian Theorem ' . Section 6.2 of this paper describes it in more detail . The significance of the Utilitarian Theorem has been much debated.2 Harsanyi believes it supports utilitarianism.3 That is , perhaps , an overstate ment , but I do think it throws enough light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I give it . It certainly makes a remarkable link between attitudes to risk and attitudes to inequality , which was Harsanyi 's original purpose.4 But this paper is not about the theorem 's significance ; I have expressed my own views on that in my Weighing Goods . It is about its truth . A number of proofs have been published besides Harsanyi's.5 Each is tied to a particular version of expected utility theory , and several rely implicitly on strong assumptions . Harsanyi's/own proof assumes that probabilities are objective and known to everyone . Other existing proofs allow for subjective probabilities , but they all assume versions of expected utility theory that derive ultimately from Leonard Savage's.6 This paper tries out the theorem in the Bolker ? Jeffrey version , which is radically different from Savage 's . I shall argue in section 6.3 that there are good reasons to test the theorem in 91 // this version . This paper proves the theorem within it . But it also shows the need for stringent assumptions . One of my main aims is to introduce the Bolker ? Jeffrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with Savage 's theory . Section 6.4 of this paper describes the theory . But no presentation of the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory these days can ignore the strong objections that have recently been raised against it from the direction of causal ' decision the ories ( which include Savage 's ) . Section 6.5 explains these objections , using some economic examples . It also argues that , although they may be cogent objections to the theory conceived as a theory of decision , conceived as a theory of valuation they leave it unscathed . The Bolker ? Jeffrey theory remains particularly appropriate for Harsanyi 's theorem , which is best understood as a matter of valuation rather than decision . Section 6.6 outlines the proof of the Utilitarian Theorem within the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory . This proof requires strong assumptions . Section 6.7 discusses the assumptions , and draws conclusions . 6.2 The utilitarian theorem Let there be h people . Let each have preferences defined on a set of alter-natives involving some uncertainty ( the same set for each person ) . Person i 's preferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the usual way . Throughout this paper , I shall assume that each person 's preferences are coherent , by which I mean they satisfy the axioms of expected utility theory . I want to allow for different versions of the theory , with different axioms , so I can not yet define coherence more exactly . Expected utility theory shows that each person 's preferences may be represented by a utility function defined on the domain of alternatives . These utility functions are expectational . By this I mean that , if an alterna tive has uncertain results , its utility is the expectation of the utility of its pos sible results . Again , the precise meaning of expectational ' can be defined only within each version of the theory . A person 's utility function is not unique ; several expectational utility functions will represent her preferences equally well . But all of them will be positive linear transforms , or in the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory ? see section 6.4 ? fractional linear transforms , of each other . Let there also be social preferences defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designate them by g , g , and g . I call them Paretian if and only if , for all alternatives A and B , // If the social preferences are coherent they may be represented by an expectational utility function . Once again , many functions , all positive linear or fractional linear transforms of each other , will serve to represent the preferences . Let Ul , ... , Uh be utility functions representing the individuals ' preferences , and Ug a utility function representing social preferences . Then , if social preferences are Paretian , Ug will be a function of the Uls : Ug(A) = W ( Ui ( A ) , ... , Uh(A) ) for all alternatives A. Also , W will be increasing in each argument . I call the social preferences utilitarian if and only if there is an expectational utility function Ug representing social preferences and for each i an expectational utility function Ut representing i 's preferences such that Ug(A) =liUi(A) for all alternatives A. Now I can state the theorem that is the subject of this paper : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , if social preferences are coherent and Paretian , they are utilitarian . Harsanyi 's original proof of the Utilitarian Theorem took probabilities to be objective and known to everyone . Some other proofs ( including mine in this paper ) are more general in that they allow for subjective probabilities that may differ from person to person . However , these proofs invariably arrive at the Utilitarian Theorem via a proof of the following : Probability Agreement Theorem . Suppose that each person has coherent preferences . Then if social preferences are coherent and Paretian , the individual and social preferences must all agree about the probabilities they assign to every event . So the initial extra generality cancels itself out : probabilities have to be universally agreed anyway . Nevertheless , the generality achieves something . It is better than simply assuming agreement about probabilities from the start . The Probability Agreement Theorem is important in its own right . It shows that the coherence and Paretian requirements on social preferences are together very stringent . They impose conditions not just on the social preferences themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have no reason to expect individual preferences to agree about probabilities . Unless they do , though , the theorem says that social preferences can not be both coherent and Paretian . Yet it is natural to think they should be both . Furthermore , coherence ztnd the Paretian requirement are the conditions of the Utilitarian Theorem . So the Probability Agreement Theorem tell us that as a general rule the conditions of the Utilitarian Theorem are mutuhe ' aim tore of good all inconsistent . I t tells us , then , that some work of interpretation needs to be done in order to reconcile the two conditions . Without this work , neither the notion of social preferences nor the Utilitarian Theorem can be prop-erly understood . I have attempted it in my Weighing Goods . In summary , the theorems say that unless individuals agree about prob-abilities there can be no coherent Paretian social preferences . And when coherent Paretian social preferences do exist , they must also agree about probabilities , and they must be utilitarian . 6.3 The ex-post approach Existing proofs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? model uncertainty in a way that is , broadly speaking , Leonard Savage 's . ' In this model there are a number of states of nature ' , any one of which may come about . People have preferences between alter-native prospects ( acts ' in Savage 's terminology ) . Each prospect associates a particular outcome ( consequence ' in Savage 's terminology ) with each state of nature : if the prospect is chosen and the state comes about , then this outcome will result . This structure is shown in table 6.1 . The cells of the table show outcomes Al , A2 , Bt , and so on . Each person has preferences amongst the alternative prospects . Expected utility theory tells us that , provided they are coherent , these preferences may be represented by probabilities and utilities . Probabilities are attached to the states of nature ; utilities , initially , to outcomes . Derivatively each prospect has a utility too , calculated as the expectation of the utility of its possible out-comes , assessed according to the probabilities . So the utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U ( A+ ? ( S2 ) U(A2) + .. . where ? stands for probability . Of two prospects , the preferred one will have the higher utility . The utility of a prospect for a person , then , is derived from the utilities of outcomes , and it depends on the person 's assessment of probabilities . On the other hand , in the model the utility of an outcome is basic . This leaves open an escape route from the Utilitarian and Probability Agreement Theorems . Many people find the implications of these theorems unattrac-tive . It seems desirable to have coherent social preferences . But according to the theorems this is rarely possible , and , even when it is , the social prefer-ences must be utilitarian in the sense defined in section 6.2 . Such utilitarian preferences seem , at least at first sight , inconsistent with the value of equal-ity . Whatever the truth about this ? and in this paper I am not going to enquire into it9 ? an escape from these implications is to adopt the so-called ex-post approach to forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammond and myself , among others . w // The idea of the ex-post approach is that social preferences about prospects should be based on individuals ' preferences about the possible outcomes of those prospects , but not necessarily on their preferences about the prospects themselves . So one should require social preferences to be Paretian about outcomes but not about prospects generally . If everyone 's preferences assign one outcome a higher utility than another , then so should social preferences , but the same need not be true for prospects . With this looser Paretian requirement , coherent social preferences are easier to come by , and they need not be utilitarian . The argument for the ex-post approach is that people 's preferences about prospects do not depend only on their wants , but also on their beliefs about probabilities . Democratic principles may insist that social preferences should be based on people 's wants , but it is quite a different matter to insist they should be based on their beliefs too . But this argument is open to a powerful objection People 's preferences about prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but so do their preferences about anything . The ex-post approach assumes that outcomes can be distinguished from prospects in such a way that prefer-ences about outcomes do not depend on beliefs about probabilities . But it is never certain what good or harm will result from anything . So a person 's preferences about anything must depend on her beliefs about the probabil-ities of its possible results . Take , for instance , one of Savage 's examples of a consequence ' ( outcome ) : a refreshing swim with friends . " If I have a refreshing swim with friends I might or might not get cramp , and my prefer-ences about the swim will depend on my beliefs about the probabilities of these results . If I swim and get cramp , I might or might not drown , and my preferences about swimming and getting cramp will depend on my beliefs about the likelihood of these results . And so on . No doubt in a practical decision-making problem of ' the sort Savage was concerned with , it is often possible to draw a workable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their results , and outcomes that have value in their own right . But this distinction , the objection goes , can not be sus tained in principle . And the ex-post approach can not be justified without it . I think this is a strong objection but not necessarily a conclusive one . It may be that actually an appropriate distinction can be drawn between prospects and outcomes . For instance , complete possible worlds are plau sible candidates for outcomes . But the objection certainly needs to be taken seriously . We should therefore not rely on conclusions drawn from a version of expected utility theory that takes for granted the distinction between prospects and outcomes . The Bolker ? Jeffrey theory ? the idea and interpretation is Richard Jeffrey 's , the axiomatization Ethan Bolker's12 ? assumes no such distinc tion . Indeed Bolker 's axiomatization explicitly rules it out , as I shall explain . A good reason , therefore , for trying out the Utilitarian Theorem within this theory is that , in so far as the theorem is true within it , no escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory In the Bolker ? Jeffrey expected utility theory , preferences , utilities , and probabilities are all defined on the same set of prospects . Jeffrey expresses these prospects as propositions , such as I have a refreshing swim with friends ' , and applies the propositional calculus to them . A prospect or proposition may be thought of as a subset of the set of all possible worlds , the subset consisting of worlds where the proposition is true . The opera tions of propositional calculus correspond to set-theoretic operations . If A is a proposition , ' A ( i.e. not A ) is the complement of A. AVB ( i.e. A or B ) is the union of A and B ; AAB ( i.e. A and B ) their intersection . If A and B are contraries ( propositions that can not both be true ) they are disjoint sets . Let A be I have a refreshing swim with friends ' , B I get cramp ' , and C I drown ' . Let Al be AAB and let A2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junction of Al and A2 ) , and Al and A2 are contrary propositions . Rules I shall describe later say that , whenever A is the disjunction of two contraries Al and A2 , where ? is probability and U utility . The formula for probability is obvi ously appropriate . To understand the formula for utility , remember that // ? ( A1 ) / ? ( A ) and ? ( Az ) / ? ( A ) are the probabilities of Al and A2 conditional on A. So the formula says that the utility of A is the expectation of utility given that A is true . In this way utility is expectational . A feature of Bolker 's axiomatization is that the set of prospects is atom-less . This means that any prospect in the set can always be broken down into a disjunction in the way that A breaks down into Al and A2 . For instance , A 1 breaks down into All = A1AC and Al2 = A1A-'C , so that AI =-A11VAl2 . And The assumption is that any prospect breaks down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the expectation of the utilities of its disjuncts . The utility of any proposition , then , depends on probabilities and utilities , on beliefs as well as wants . There are no propositions that play the role of outcomes or consequences and have a utility that is independent of probability judgements . The ex-post approach is therefore not possible within the Bolker-Jeffrey theory . A major difference between the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory and others is this : in the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory , when prospects are combined together by the truth-functional operation of disjunction they retain their own probabilities , made conditional on the disjunction . Other theories combine prospects or outcomes by forming gambles . This involves artificially assigning a probability ( or a state of nature , which has its own probability ) to each outcome . Setting up a gamble , in fact , involves altering causal relations in the world . In practice the sorts of gamble that are required by the theory may be causally impossible . For instance , fine weather tomorrow may be assigned to the state of nature : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toss of a coin can not actually determine what the weather will be . In order to include them in her preference ordering a person has to imagine herself being offered such impossible gambles . The Bolker ? Jeffrey theory , on the other hand , assumes that a person retains her actual beliefs about the causal processes in the world . Jeffrey considers this the theory 's main advantage.13 Take a set fl of prospects that is closed under the operations of disjunction and negation ( or union and complementation ) . That is to say , N. is then a Boolean algebra. ' 4 It will contain a unit T and a zero F. T is the necessarily true propositign and Fthe necessarily false one : // T is the set of all possible worlds and F the empty set . The Bolker ? Jeffrey theory takes the field of preferences to be a Boolean algebra 91 with the zero removed . Write this field J ' = ? F . F , then , has no place in the preference ordering . The algebra N need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that N. is atomless , which rules this out . An atomless Boolean algebra is one whose every element has a non-zero strict sub-element : This implies , for one thing , that the algebra can not contain a set consisting of a single world . I have already described the significance of this assump tion of atomlessness . We also assume that the algebra is complete . This means that it contains all disjunctions of arbitrary sets of contrary members of itself.ls Like other expected utility theories , the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory starts from given preferences and shows that , provided these preferences satisfy certain axioms , they can be represented by an expectational utility function . The axioms are : that the preferences are a complete preorder on 91 ' , that they are continuous in a particular sense , and that they satisfy these two conditions : Averaging . If A and B in 91 ' are contraries then A B implies A AVB BandA=  --  - Bimplies AAVB  --  =B . Impartiality . If A , B and C in f ' are pairwise contraries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and AV C BV C , then for every D in J ' that is contrary to A and B , AVD=BVD . The averaging axiom says that a disjunction lies somewhere between the disjuncts in the preference ordering . It slightly resembles the independence axiom found in other versions of expected utility theory . The independence axiom implies that a probability mixture ' of two prospects lies somewhere between the prospects in the preference ordering . But it implies much more than this too , and furthermore it implies it for any probability mixture with any arbitrary probabilities . As I explained earlier , in the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory , on the other hand , prospects always carry their own probabilities with them when they combine in a disjunction . Combination with arbitrary probabilities is not allowed . So the averaging axiom is much weaker than independence . The much-criticized independence axiom is not required by the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory . The impartiality axiom is less transparent . Take two contrary proposi tions A and B that are indifferent to each other . Form their disjunctions with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These // disjunctions AV C and BVC will be indifferent to each other if and only if A and B are equally probable . So a way of testing whether two indifferent propositions are equally probable is to compare together the disjunctions they respectively form with a third , non-indifferent proposition . The impartiality axiom says this test will deliver the same answer whatever third , non-indifferent proposition is used . Compare Savage 's Postulate 4.16 Savage , too , needs to test whether two events , say E and F , are equally probable . He does this by taking a pair of outcomes , say A and B , that are known not to be indifferent . He forms a gamble ( A , E ; B , F ) in which A comes about in event E and B in F. And he forms the opposite gamble ( B , E ; A , F ) . The events are equally probable if and only if these gambles are indifferent . Savage 's Postulate 4 says this test will deliver the same answer whatever pair of non-indifferent outcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsatisfactory in one respect . The explanation I have given for it presupposes expected utility theory to some extent . I said that AV C and BVC will be indifferent ( for indifferent A and B and nonindifferent C ) if and only if A and B are equally probable . But the reason for this is that the utility of a disjunction is the average of the utility of the disjuncts , weighted by their probabilities . And this reason comes out of expected utility theory . It is unsatisfactory that an axiom from which expected utility theory is supposed to be derived needs to be explained in this way . Savage 's Postulate 4 is in exactly the same position . The gambles ( A , E ; B , F ) and ( B , E ; A , F ) will be indifferent if and only if E and F are equally probable . The reason for this is that the utility of a gamble is the average utility of its possible outcomes , weighted by the probabilities of the events in which they occur . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postulate is one of the axioms from which expected utility theory is supposed to be derived . The impartiality axiom , then , is neither more nor less unsatisfactory than Savage 's Postulate 4 . Now we come to the representation theorem : Bolker 's Existence Theorem . Let at be a complete atomless Boolean algebra , and let be coherent preference on Jr . Then there is a probability measure ? on t and a signed measure v on 91 such that for all A and Bin 91 ' A #@# B if and only if v(A)I ? ( A ) v(B)IR(B) . ( I shall use the unqualified term measure ' to include signed measures , nonnegative measures , and ndn-positive measures . By a non-negative measure ' I mean a measure such that ? ( A ) ? 0 for all A in FA . By a positive measure ' , I mean a non-negative measure ? such that ? ( A ) = 0 implies A = F. ) // Because and v are measures , whenever A and B are contraries ( disjoint ) then U @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because if A and B are contraries , and In the existence theorem the role of utility is played by the quotient of measures v/ ? . Granted the existence of p , and v , we define utility U on 9i ' by I explained , using the example above , that this formula makes U(AVB) the expectation of utility given that AVB is true . The measure v is best thought of as simply a convenient construction , the product of utility and probability . Notice that the averaging axiom rules out propositions ( other than F ) that have probability zero . For if A , B e Jl ' , A #@# B , and ? ( B ) = 0 , we shall have from equation ( 1 ) that U(AVB) = U(A) , contrary to the averaging axiom . The measure ? is therefore strictly positive ( so U is well-defined on R ' ) . Bolker defends this implication of the axiom by saying that propositions to which a person assigns probability zero can simply be left out of N.1 ' This may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section 6.6 , I shall be assuming that everyone 's preferences and also social preferences are defined on the same field E1 ' . So there is a substantive assumption implied here : that all these different preferences attach zero probability to the same set of propositions . Notice too that , for a similar reason , the averaging axiom rules out infinite values for v(A) . Bolker 's Uniqueness Theorem . Let ? , ? ' be probability measures and v , v ' signed measures on a complete atomless Boolean algebra N. Then ? , v represent the same preferences as ? ' , v ' if and only if // The transformation of R , v to v ' transforms utility U to This is a fractional linear transformation ' . The Bolker ? Jeffrey theory allows a wider range of transformations for utility than other expected utility theories , which allow only linear transformations . It also allows transformations of probabilities , which other theories rule out . Bolker and Jeffrey have given an explanation of why other theories deter-mine utilities and probabilities more tightly than theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as data on which to construct utilities . Preferences are defined on all gambles in which outcomes are assigned to arbitrary states of nature or assigned arbitrary probabilities . As I explained , such gambles may be causally impossible . In the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory prospects always retain their own probabilities ; when prospects are com bined in a disjunction the probabilities are simply made conditional . It turns out that utilities and probabilities are then more loosely determined . There is one case , however , where probabilities can not be transformed , and utilities are confined to positive linear transformations only. - This is where the range of U on 91 ' is unbounded above and below . Condition ( 3c ) requires that c U(A) + d #@# 0 for all A in If U is unbounded above and below this is possible only if c = O. Then by ( 3b ) d=1 , and by ( 4 ) U ' = a U+ b . So any transform of U is also unbounded above and below . I shall call preferences unbounded if they are represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other decision theories rule out unbounded utilities as impossible . In effect , this is because of the St Petersburg Paradox . Given a sequence of prospects with unbounded utilities , one can construct out of them a gamble that has infinite utility . This is what the St Petersburg game does . And an infinite utility can not be accommodated within the theory . But to construct such a gamble one needs to assign each outcome an artificially chosen prob ability . And this , as I have explained , is not allowed in the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory . So unbounded utilities are not ruled out in this theory.19 Indeed , in the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory utility functions that are unbounded either above or below are nothing out of the ordinary . They can always be transformed into bounded functions by a suitable choice of coefficients in ( 2 ) . And any utility function that does not attain its upper or lower bound can be transformed into one that is unbounded above or below.20 This makes it clear that unboundedness need not imply extreme desirability or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbounded above and below are in a different class , because they can not he transfOrmed into hounded functions and they // permit no transformation of probability . But one thing that is missing , I think , from Bolker 's and Jeffrey 's accounts of their theory is a characteriza-tion of unbounded preferences . What must be special about preferences to make their utility representation unbounded above and below ? One feature they must have is to possess no top and no bottom : no prospect preferred or indifferent to every prospect and no prospect to which every prospect is preferred or indifferent . But it is not only unbounded preferences that have this feature . And it is not clear what extra feature unbounded preferences must have . Jeffrey gives a necessary and sufficient condition for preferences to be unbounded , but it is intuitively opaque.21 Throughout this paper I shall adopt the convenient normalization that Since ? is a probability measure From ( 2a ) and from ( 2b ) I shall call a transformation legal if it meets these conditions . 6.5 Decision versus valuation Consider this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are facing a prisoners ' dilemma . Table 6.2 shows the benefits ( money , say ) : first in each bracket is your benefit , then hers . There is no love lost between the pair of you , and you are going to act entirely self-interestedly . But she and you think very much alike , and you know this . So you know that if you act nice she will probably act nice too , and if you act nasty she will probably act nasty too . // Let A be the proposition You act nasty ' and B Your twin acts nasty . ' You know that the probability of B given A , ? ( AAB ) / ? ( A ) , is-high . Correspondingly , ? ( AA-B ) IR(A) is low . In the Bolker-Jeffrey theory , U(A) = U(AAB) ? ( AAB ) l ? ( A ) + U(AA-B) ? ( AA-'B ) l ? ( A ) . So if ? ( AAB ) I i(A) is high and ? ( A/c-B ) I ( A ) low , U(A) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act nice ' and D is Your twin acts nice ' , U(C) is near U(CAD) . But U(CAD) is well above U(AAB) because CAD gets you 5 and AAB only 1 . So U(C) will be above U(A) . This suggests you ought to act nice . But to most people this seems to be an incorrect conclusion.23 Whatever your twin does , you do better by acting nasty . Acting nasty is a dominant strategy , so that acting nice is irrational . The Bolker-Jeffrey theory seems to come to the wrong conclusion in this case . Its mistake is fairly plain . Acting nice gives you evidence that your twin will probably act nice too , because she is like you . In a sense , then , it makes it probable that she will act nice , and so give you a good result . That is why the theory gives acting nice a high utility . But your acting nice does not have any causal influence on how she acts . And that is what counts in deciding what to do . The theory seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to a resurgence of causal decision theory ' in opposition to the evidential ' Bolker-Jeffrey theory.24 Savage 's theory is the leading example of a causal decision theory . In Savage 's theory there must be states of nature whose probabilities are independent of actions . Faced with the twin prisoners ' dilemma , a follower of Savage has two alternatives . She may decline to apply the theory at all , perhaps taking the general view that decision theory does not apply to games . Or she may pick some things to serve as states of nature . She may , for instance , take your twin 's acts as states of nature from your point of view . They will then have to be assigned probabilities independent of your own acts . And whatever probabilities they are assigned , acting nasty will come out with a higher expected utility for you . Either way , the ? Bolker-Jeffrey theory 's incorrect conclusion is avoided . So , on the face of it at least , we have here a weakness in the 13olker Jeffrey theory , which causal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good It is a serious weakness , too , because situations like the twin prisoners ' dilemma are common in practice . Many free-rider problems have the structure of a prisoners ' dilemma . And in many of them the participants , though not twins , are similar enough for their behaviour to be quite closely correlated . For instance , suppose I , considering my own interest only , am wondering whether to join a trade union . If a lot of people join , we shall all be better off because we shall win benefits . But , however many people join , I should always be better off not joining , because I should get the benefits anyway , and save the dues . I am much like other people , though . So if I join , many other people will probably do so too . The argument I gave for the twin prisoners ' dilemma applies here too . The Bolker ? Jeffrey theory therefore seems to say I should join . But actually , most people would think , if I am concerned with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , may face dilemmas that raise the same difficulty . Take a government faced with a public that has rational expectations . It is wondering whether or not to expand the money supply . Table 6.3 shows how the effects of its actions will depend on what the people expect . If the government expands the money supply , the people will probably have predicted that , so the result will be inflation . If it does not expand it , they will probably have predicted that too , so the result will be no change . The Bolker ? Jeffrey theory , then , will assign a higher expected utility to not expanding . It suggests this is the right thing to do . Dominance reasoning , however , shows that the right thing is to expand . That , at any rate , is the conclusion of most authors who have considered this time-inconsistency problem ' . - 'S This government 's dilemma has exactly the form of the Newcomb problem ' , 26 which first led to the renewed interest in causal decision theory.27 There may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weakness I have been describing.28 But in any case , it is a weakness only when the theory is taken literally as a theory of decision . If it is taken as a theory of valuation , there is no problem . Although , in the twin prisoners ' dilemma , you ought to act nasty , it would nevertheless be better for you , in a natural sense , if you acted nice . If , for instance , you were to learn in some way that you were going to act nice , you would be justifiably pleased.79 That news would tell you that your twin would probably do the same , so that the outcome would probably be a good one . In the other example , it would be better , in a natural sense , if the government kept the money supply constant . This is what the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory says , and it makes good sense . It is , furthermore , a sense that causal decision theory can not recognize . So here , as a theory of valuation , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be connected with decision in the end . The point of making valuations is to supply reasons for deciding one way or another // when there is a decision to be made . But the connection need not be immediate . For instance , before it comes to a decision in some matter , a government may need to make complicated calculations about how good or bad the alternatives are for the people . In these calculations it may be appropriate for it to take good ' and bad ' for the people in a sense that is not directly connected with decisions the people make . So there is nothing wrong in general with separating value from decision . And it is useful in our context . Let us ask : which sort of expected utility theory is it appropriate to apply to the Utilitarian Theorem ? a theory of decision or a theory'of valuation ? The right one to pick is the one that makes the best sense of the theorem 's assumptions : coherence and the Paretian assumption . The Utilitarian Theorem is about individual and social preferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can interpret it as best fits the theorem . In one sense , a rational person in the twin prisoners ' dilemma will prefer the prospect of acting nasty , since this is what she ought to do . In another sense , she will prefer the prospect of acting nice , since that would be better for her . Let us call these the decisional ' and valuational ' senses of prefer ' . The same distinction applies to social preferences too . Of two alternatives , the one that is socially preferred in the decisional sense is the one the government should choose if it has the choice . The one that is socially preferred in the valuational sense is the better one.3 ? Suppose we pick the valuational interpretation . The Bolker ? Jeffrey theory suits this interpretation , and we can expect individual and social preferences , under this interpretation , to be coherent according to the Bolker-Jeffrey theory . What about the Paretian assumption ? Look again at the twin prisoners ' dilemma . Under the valuational interpretation , you prefer the prospect of your acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your twin prefers that too . So the Paretian assumption requires that your acting nice should lx socially preferred to your acting nasty . And this seems quite right in the valuational sense : it would indeed be better if you acted nice . All the assumptions of the Utilitarian Theorem , then , I06 The structure of good work well under the valuational interpretation . This means that the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory suits the theorem . Suppose , alternatively , we pick the decisional interpretation . Savage 's theory suits this interpretation , and we can expect individual and social preferences , under this interpretation , to be coherent according to Savage 's theory . What about the Paretian assumption ' ? I can find no way of setting up an example like the twin prisoners ' dilemma so as to give worthwhile scope to the Paretian assumption . I said that Savage 's theory can get a grip in the example by treating your twin 's acts as states of nature from your point of view . Given that , your acts can be thought of as prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting nice . But to apply the Paretian assumption , we need both players to have preferences over the same prospects . This means we need to define states of nature that are the same for both . And however this is done , prospects will have to be joint acts : yours and your twin 's . Your own acts will not be prospects on their own , so it will no longer be possible to say that your acting nasty has a greater expected utility for you . I conclude , then , that , if we want to apply the Utilitarian Theorem to examples like this , the decisional interpretation will get us nowhere . But the valuational interpretation works . I think this shows , at the very least , that this interpretation is as good as the decisional one for the pur-poses of the Utilitarian Theorem . But the objections I raised to the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory earlier in this section apply only when it is taken as a theory of decision . Taken as a theory of valuation , the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply it to the Utilitarian Theorem , and section 6.3 offered a good reason for doing so . 6.6 The utilitarian theorem in the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory Let 9i be a complete atomless Boolean algebra . Let its unit be T and its zero F Let 9i ' = ? F. Let there be h+ 1 preference relations #@# I , #@# 2 , ... , #@# h , #@# g on 9 ' . Write I = 1 , ... , h and I+ = 1 , ... , h U g . I explained in section 6.3 that ? , is strictly positive and v ; finite . For each i Given these assumptions , Bolker 's Existence Theorem tells us that for each i e I+ there is a probability measure ? ; and a signed measure v ; such that , for all A and B in R ' // E I+ , normalize v ; to make vi(T) = O. Write U ; ( A ) = vi(A)l ? ; ( A ) . Some definitions : I shall assume : Assumption 4 requires , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propositions . And secondly it requires some minimal independence between different people 's preferences . Now my first theorem : Theorem 1 . Under Assumptions 1-4 , for each i E I there is a number e ; #@# 0 such that for all A in . i ' : The proof of this theorem and all other theorems appear in the Appendices to the original edition of this paper.31 Now suppose there is probability agreement , or more exactly that all probabilities can be transformed into agreement . That is , suppose for each i e I+ there is a legal transform i. of such that ? , ( A ) = ? g(A) for all i E I and all A E Then for each i E I take the e ; from Theorem 1 and let v , = e ; v ; . Let vP = vQ . These are legal transformations . Then So we have this Corollary to Theorem 1 . Under Assumptions 1-4 , #@# g is utilitarian if for each i e I+ there is a legal transform ? ; of p , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , I% a sufficient condition for the Utilitarian Theorem . ( It is also necessary , but that is not proved in this paper . ) To establish the t ltilitarian Theorem , then , we would need only to estab108 The structure of good lish a version of the Probability Agreement Theorem : that individual and social probabilities can be transformed to make them all equal . Assumptions 1-4 , however , are not enough to ensure that this is true . The most that can be said is that the individual and social preferences must all agree about the probabilities of propositions that everyone finds indifferent to T. ( These probabilities can not be transformed anyway . ) Let be Ae9=t ' : A ; Tforalliel . Theorem 2 . Under Assumptions 1-4 , ? i(A) = p , g(A) for all i e I and all A ? s . But outside it may not be possible to transform probabilities into agreement.32 Consequently the Utilitarian Theorem can fail . Before we can prove the Utilitarian Theorem we shall need two major new assumptions : Assumption 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % ' , there is a B e Jt ' such that B =iAandB Tforallj ? I ? i . Assumption 6 . For all i e I , #@# i is unbounded . Assumption 5 says that there are propositions over the whole range of i 's preferences , from top to bottom , that everyone else considers indifferent to T. It says that the different people 's preferences are independent of each other in a sense . I shall discuss this independence assumption and Assumption 6 in section 6.7 . Assumption 4 contains a minimal independence assumption of the same sort . Note that Assumptions 5 and 6 together imply Assumption 4 . Granted assumptions 5 and 6 , the Probability Agreement Theorem can be proved : Theorem 3 . Under Assumptions 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 , ii(A) = ? g(A) for all ieIand all Ae ' . ( This says probabilities actually agree , not merely that they can be transformed into agreement , because under Assumption 6 probabilities can not be transformed . ) From Theorem 3 and the Corollary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 . Under Assumptions 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 , #@# g is utilitarian . 6.7 . Conclusions The Utilitarian Theorem , as I described it in section 6.1 , says that if individual and social preferences are coherent ( Assumptions 1 and 2 ) , and if social preferences are Paretian ( Assumption 3 ) , then it follows that social preferences are utilitarian . Theorem 4 tells us that Assumptions 5 and 6 are sufficient conditions for the truth of this theorem . Neither would be // sufficient on its own.33 Neither assumption is necessary , but I believe no weaker significant assumptions would be sufficient to establish the Utilitarian Theorem.34 So our trust in the theorem has to rest on these assumptions . How plausible are they ? Assumption 5 is very demanding . The values people assign to prospects are likely to be correlated to some extent . A nuclear war , for instance , comes near the bottom of most people 's scales of preference . But Assumption 5 requires there to be some prospect that is just as bad as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with equanimity . This is implausible . I doubt the Utilitarian Theorem could be proved on the basis of a much weaker independence assumption than this . My proof depends crucially on the existence of prospects that are very good or very bad for one person and neutral for everyone else . So I doubt if the objectionable feature of Assumption 5 could be eliminated . Other versions of the Utilitarian Theorem , within other versions of deci-sion theory , also rely on independence assumptions of the same sort . For example , take Peter Fishburn 's proof , which assumes objective probabili-ties.35 Fishburn assumes that for each person i there are prospects Ai and Bi such that Ai #@# i Bi and Ai =  --  -j Bi for all other than i . This is a very weak inde-pendence assumption . Indeed , it is equivalent to my Assumption 4 . My Corollary to Theorem 1 , which assumes probability agreement , corre-sponds closely to Fishburn 's theorem . It , too , requires Assumption 4 . For another example , one of Peter Hammond 's proofs assumes implicitly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . . . , u21 , . . . , unn ) , where uir is person i 's utility in state of nature r , is a product set HSi , . , where Si , . is the range of uir.36 This means that one person 's utility in one state can move over the whole of its range whilst the utilities for every other person ? state pair remain constant . This is an extremely strong independence assumption . An earlier proof of Hammond 's helps itself to variations in uir without any constraint.37 The need for Assumption 6 , the unboundedness assumption , is confined to the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory , because it makes no sense in other theories . But one might say that an assumption with the same role is already implicit in other theories . The effect of Assumption 6 is to cancel out a sort of extra generality that the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory initially possesses beyond other expected utility theories : the wider range of utility transformations it allows . When preferences are unbounded , only linear transformations are possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this conclusion . I expected that having a wide range of utility functions available for representing preferences would actually make it easier to find a social utility function that is the sum of individual functions . But the opposite is true . This sug-gests to me that a tight determination of utilities may be playing a part in making the Utilitarian Theorem work in other versions of expected utility theory too . As I explained in section 6.4 , this tight determination is the // result of supposing that a person has preferences over arbitrarily constructed gambles , including gambles that are causally impossible . It may be , then , that social preferences are forced to be utilitarian only because we insist that they should be coherent and Paretian over gambles that are causally impossible . This is some reason to be cautious about the theorem . It is not easy to assess the plausibility of Assumption 6 itself : that everyone 's preferences are unbounded . I said in section 6.4 that Bolker and Jeffrey have not made it clear just what unbounded preferences are like , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common or uncommon . But to assume that everyone 's preferences are unbounded does seem , at least , to be asking for a large coincidence . I conclude , then , that the Utilitarian Theorem , though it can be proved within the Bolker ? Jeffrey theory , needs to be treated with caution . In my Weighing Goods , I have reinterpreted the theorem in terms of a person 's good , rather than her preferences . I take a person 's utility to represent her betterness relation ' is at least as good for the person as instead of her preference relation is preferred or indifferent to ? . The notion of betterness applied to uncertain prospects presupposes probabilities that are the same for everyone.38 The reinterpreted theorem therefore does not require Assumptions 5 and 6 . It is shown to be true by the Corollary to Theorem 1 . This requires only Assumption 4 , the weakest of independence assumptions . I therefore have faith in the reinterpreted theorem . 7 Fairness This chapter presents a theory about fairness , as it applies to the distribu tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random lotteries . Sometimes a lottery is the fairest way of distributing a good , and my theory explains , better than any other theory I know , why this is so . That is the main evidence I offer for it . But the theory is not limited to lotteries ; it is intended to apply whenever goods are distributed between people . I shall use the fairness of lotteries as a guide to fairness in general . ' 7.1 Choosing between candidates It often happens that there are several candidates to receive a good , but the good can not be divided up to go round them all . The good may be very important ; it may even amount to the saving of the candidate 's life . For instance , not enough kidneys are available for transplant for everyone who needs one . As a result , some people are denied treatment for their kidney failure , and consequently die . For each candidate , there will be reasons why she should have the good , or some of it . ( I mean prima facie reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amongst them will be the benefits , to the candidate herself and to other people , that will result from this candidate 's receiving the good . When the good is the saving of life , these benefits will depend on how much the candidate enjoys her life , what responsibilities she has to other people , and so on . Then there may also be other reasons . One may be desert : some of the candidates may deserve the good , perhaps because of services they have performed in the past . For the moment , suppose all these reasons can be weighed against each other . ( I shall question this later . ) Then , for some can didates , the reasons why they should have the good will be stronger , on balance , than for others . Let us call one person a better ' candidate than another if she has stronger reasons in her favour . Ill // How should it be decided which of the candidates should get the good ? Several procedures might be used . One is to have some authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . But this procedure has its costs . The job of assembling and assessing the necessary information may be expensive and time-consuming . The responsibility of deciding who is to live and who to die ( if that is in question ) may be an intolerable emotional burden . Furthermore , the authority may not actually succeed in picking the best candidates . It may choose the candidates who best meet corrupt or prejudiced criteria , rather than the ones who are actually the best . One procedure that avoids the costs and dangers of deliberate selection by an authority is to apply some fixed rule . ( There is a risk of corruption or prejudice in setting up the rule , but not once it is set up . ) And it may be possible to devise a rule that goes some way towards selecting the best candidates . For life saving , the rule of picking the youngest will do this . Age will certainly be one of the factors that helps determine which candidates are the best . Other things being equal , it is better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does more good to the person who is saved : it gives her , on average , more years of life . So there is some correlation between a person 's youth and how good a candidate she is . A lottery is another procedure that avoids the costs and dangers of deliberate selection . Unlike a well-chosen fixed rule , though , it is no more likely to pick the best candidates than any others . So what advantage can it possibly have over a fixed rule ? Plainly , only that it is sometimes fairer . But how can this be so ? How can a lottery be fairer than a rule such as picking the youngest , which has a tendency to select the better candidates ? Answering this question is the main test that has to be passed by any account of the fairness of lotteries . To answer it properly demands a particular theory of fairness in general ; only this theory , which I shall describe in sections 7.3 and 7.4 , is able to explain adequately the fairness of a lottery . 7.2 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall first set out what I think it needs to account for : the facts about the fairness of lotteries that need to be explained . First : a lottery is by no means always fair . It would not , for instance , be a fair way of choosing whom to award the prize in a violin competition . So in explaining the fairness of lotteries we shall need a criterion for distinguishing when lotteries are fair from when they are not . Secondly : our account of the fairness of lotteries can not simply be that lotteries are good tie breakers , appropriate only when the reasons in favour of different candidates are exactly balanced . The two examples below show // that it is sometimes right to hold t. lottery even when reasons are not exactly balanced . In any case , if a lottery were appropriate only for breaking a tie , its value would be insignificant . It will hardly ever happen in practice that reasons balance exactly . And if ever they do , the slightest change in one of them would mean they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold a lottery only for breaking a tie , it would no longer be right to hold one . So the value of a lottery would be lexicographically dominated by other values . ( Section 7.6 , however , qualifies this point . ) Furthermore , to say that lotteries are good tie breakers fails to explain their fairness . When there is a tie , it does not matter which candidate is chosen . What is required is simply a means of getting the decision made . A lottery is a handy means , even when no issue of fairness arises . When I can not decide between two restaurants for dinner , I may toss a coin . This is not in order to be fair to the restaurants , but simply to avoid the fate of Buridan 's Ass . When it comes to a choice not between restaurants , but between candidates for some good , a lottery is sometimes more than just a handy means of getting the decision made when there is a tie . It is sometimes a better means than others because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of why it is fairer . Thirdly : the fairness of a lottery does not consist solely in the fact that it overcomes the costs and dangers of deliberate selection by an authority . I have already explained that selection by a fixed rule is likely to be a better way of doing that . And even when it is possible to choose the best candidates deliberately , without cost and without corruption or prejudice , there is still sometimes a case for a lottery . The following two examples make this point , and also the second point mentioned above . The first example is about games . Most games begin by holding a lottery to settle which player starts in the most favourable position ( playing white , say ) . Fairness requires this . But normally some players will be better candidates for the favourable position than others , as I defined better candidate ' in section 7.1 . For instance , usually more joy will be caused in total by the victory of one player rather than another , so a greater expectation of benefit would result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose there is a referee who , without prejudice or corruption , is easily able to pick out the best candidate . It would still be wrong to leave the decision to the referee rather than a lottery . The second example is a dangerous mission . Someone has to be sent on a mission that is so dangerous she will probably be killed . The people available are similar in all respects , except that one has special talents that make her more likely than the others to carry owt the mission well ( but no more likely to survive ) . This fact is recognized by her and everyone else . Who should he sent ? Who , that is , should receive the good of being left behind ? // It could plausibly be thought that the right thing is simply to send the talented person . But it is also very plausible that doing so would be unfair to her , and that fairness requires a lottery to be held amongst all the candidates . These two views are not incompatible . It may be that fairness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to hold one , but that in this case fairness is outweighed by expediency , so that on balance it is right to send the talented candidate without a lottery . This depends on the circumstances . If it is vital that there should be no slip in the execution of the mission , the unfairness will be tolerable . But if a less-than-perfect performance is acceptable , more importance can be given to fairness . In some circumstances , fairness will win , and a lottery should be held . 7.3 Claims Those , then , are the facts . How can they be explained ? In this section and the next , I shall present my theory of fairness . I mean it to apply to the distribution of any sort of good , whether indivisible or not . In section 7.5 , I shall come back to indivisible goods and lotteries . When a good is to be distributed , for each candidate there are reasons why she should have some of it . These reasons together determine what ought to be done : how the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reasons combine together to determine what ought to be done ? As I shall put it : how do reasons work ? There are various views about this . One is teleology . Teleology claims that the good ought to be distributed in whatever way maximizes overall benefit.2 So the only sort of reason it recognizes for a particular candidate to get the good is a benefit that would result . Imagine the good being distributed one unit at a time . Each unit should go to the candidate whose receiving it would produce the most benefit ; this will normally ensure that overall benefit is maximized when all the units are eventually distributed . At each stage , the reason for giving a particular unit to one candidate is the benefit that would result ; the reason for giving it to the next candidate is the benefit that would result from that ; and so on . All these reasons should be weighed against each other , and the unit allocated to the candidate for whom the reason is strongest . So we can say that reasons are combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in teleology . Weighing up goes along with maximizing . Other views disagree with teleology . One , for instance , claims that some reasons are side constraints . A side constraint determines directly what ought to be done ; it is not subject to being weighed against other reasons . Rights are often thought to be side constraints . Suppose that , amongst the candidates for a good , one has a right to some part of it . Suppose it is her income , for instance , which she has earned . Then side-constraint theory // says simply that she should have it ; no question of weighing arises . The theory may acknowledge the existence of teleological reasons too , which work by weighing up . It may allow that weighing up is appropriate amongst other candidates , but not for a candidate who has a right . I am going to describe a third type of reason , which works in a third way . To introduce it , I shall first draw a distinction of a different sort amongst the reasons why a candidate should get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the candidate herself , and others are not . I shall call the former claims that the candidate has to the good . The distinction between claims and other reasons is easy to grasp intu-itively . Take the dangerous mission , for example . One candidate is more tal- ented than the others . This is a reason for allotting to the others the good of staying behind . But the other candidates ' lack of talent gives them no claim to this good . It may be right to leave them behind , but it is not owed them to do so . Whatever claim they have to this good , the talented candi-date has it also . The distinction can appear even within teleology ? indeed within utilitar-ianism . All utilitarians think that if a person would benefit from having some particular good , that is a reason why she should have it . But some utilitarians think this reason is a duty owed to the person ? a claim and others think it is not . William Godwin , for one , thought it was a claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to that , the exclusive possession of which being awarded to him , a greater sum of benefit or pleasure will result than could have arisen from its being otherwise appropriated. ' 3 The difference is nicely brought out by the attitude of utilitarians to changes in the world 's population . Henry Sidgwick ' believed an action was right if it maximized the total of good enjoyed by people in the world . So he believed one should promote growth in population if the extra people brought into existence will have good lives , and no harm will be done to people already living . But this is clearly not a duty owed to the people who will be brought into existence . One can not owe anyone a duty to bring her into existence , because failing in such a duty would not be failing anyone . Sidgwick , then , evidently thought that the duty to benefit people is not owed to those people themselves . On the other hand , a utilitarian view pro-mulgated by Jan Narveson5 is that one should promote the good of exist-ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason to increase the total of good in the world simply for its own sake . So the fact that the extra people will enjoy good lives is no reason to increase the world 's popula-tion . Narveson is evidently motivated by the thought that , whatever duty there is to promote a person 's good , it must be owed to the person herself Consequently , there can be no duty to bring a person into existence . It is clear , then , that there is a distinction between claims and other // reasons . It is not so clear which particular reasons are claims and which are not . Even utilitarians , I have been saying , disagree about this . And if we recognize nonutilitarian reasons , there is further scope for disagreement . If we accept desert as a reason why a person should have a good , it is perhaps an uncontroversial further step to take it as a claim . But need is more controversial . If a person could benefit from a good , that is no doubt a reason why she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be reluctant to accept it as a claim . If , however , the person needs the good , perhaps we would accept that . Perhaps , for instance , a person who needs a kidney has a claim on it . But this is controversial . In this chapter , I am not going to engage in controversy over which reasons are claims and which are not . I shall take it for granted that some are : that some reasons why a person should have a good are duties owed to the person . And I shall concentrate on asking how these reasons , whichever they are , work . How do claims combine with each other and with other reasons in determining what should be done ? 7.4 What claims require Some teleologists , as I say , recognize the existence of claims . But they suppose claims work by weighing up , just like other reasons . They think that the right thing to do , and the right way to distribute a good , is determined by the balance of reasons , whether claims or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the same scales , in the same maximizing calculation . But the fact that conflicting claims are duties owed to different people gives rise to an alternative intuition . Simply weighing claims against each other may not seem enough . Weighing up is the treatment we would naturally give to conflicting duties owed to a single person . Applying it between different people may not seem to be giving proper recognition to the people 's separateness . ' In particular , weighing up claims does not seem to give proper attention to fairness . Take the example of the dangerous mission again . All reasons are evenly balanced , apart from the special reason for sending the talented candidate : she will perform the mission better . So weighing up reasons must conclude in favour of sending this candidate . But that seems unfair to her . It might be the right thing to do under pressure of expediency , but nevertheless it seems unfair . The talented candidate has a claim to the good of being left behind , and her claim is as strong as anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's claims , and the further reason that she will perform the mission better , her claim is overridden . Weighing up seems to override claims , rather than respect them . // It is fairness that matters here because the particular business of fairness is to mediate between the conflicting claims of different people . But I need to qualify this remark slightly . Certainly , fairness is concerned only with claims , and not with other reasons . Suppose there is some reason why a person should have a good , but she has no claim to it . Then if she does not get the good , that may be wrong , but she suffers no unfairness . It can not be unfair to deny her a good she had no claim to in the first place . On the other hand , it is possible that some claims are outside the domain of fairness , and work in different ways from the one I shall be describing . I shall say more about this possibility later , and for the time being I shall ignore it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Weighing up claims is not enough , then , because it does not give proper attention to fairness . It would not even be enough to give claims extra heavy weight in the course of weighing up . The example of the dangerous mission shows this , too . However much weight is given to claims , each person 's claim to the good of staying behind is still the same . So the claims will all balance , and the talented person will still be sent , because of the extra reason . But this is unfair to her . What , then , does fairness require ? It requires , I suggest , that claims should be satisfied in proportion to their strength . I do not mean proportion ' to be taken too precisely . But I do mean that equal claims require equal satisfaction , that stronger claims require more satisfaction than weaker ones , and also ? very importantly ? that weaker claims require some satisfaction . Weaker claims must not simply be overridden by stronger ones . This suggestion merely extends and tightens up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people identically situated should be treated identically . Economists call this the principle of horizontal equity ' . It is , like my generalization of it , inconsistent with teleological maximizing . To see why , imagine two people have equal claims to some good , but that , if the good is divided between them , less benefit will be produced in total than if it is all given to one . Then maximizing implies it should all go to one , but horizontal equity says it should be divided . The heart of my suggestion is that fairness is concerned only with how well each person 's claim is satisfied compared with how well other people 's are satisfied . It is concerned only with relative satisfaction , not absolute satisfaction . Take a case where all the candidates for a good have claims of equal strength . Then fairness requires equality in satisfaction . So if all the candidates get the same quantity of the good , then fairness has been perfectly achieved , even if they each get very little , or indeed none at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get none at all . For each claimant there is at least one reason why she should have some of the good : the reason that // constitutes her claim . Claims should be satisfied , therefore . But it is not unfair if they are not , provided everyone is treated proportionally . Everyone 's claim to a good should , prima facie , be satisfied . Indeed , if there is any reason , whether a claim or not , for a person to have some of a good , she should have some . Call this the satisfaction requirement ' . Normally , this requirement can not be fully met for everyone . What does it require then ? I suggest it requires maximizing of satisfaction . This implies that , to meet this requirement , claims will have to be weighed against each other and against other reasons ; I think weighing up and maximizing are appropriate for the satisfaction requirement . But then also fairness requires that claims should be satisfied in proportion to their strength . Claims therefore give rise to two separate requirements : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportionally . It will normally be impossible to fulfil both requirements completely . Consequently , the two will themselves have to be combined together in some way , to determine what should be done , all things considered . Here again , I suggest that weighing up is appropriate : the demands of fairness should be weighed against the demands of overall satisfaction . In some circumstances , no doubt , it will be very important to be fair , and in others fairness may be outweighed by expediency . In summary , claims work like this . Together with other reasons , they go to determine the satisfaction requirement by weighing up . And claims together determine the fairness requirement by the proportionality rule . Then the fairness requirement is itself weighed against the satisfaction requirement . Evidently , claims in my theory do not work as side constraints ; they do not necessarily prevail . This may be a limitation of the theory . I defined claims as duties owed to people , and it may be that within this class there are some claims that are genuinely side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not covered by my theory . My theory is limited to the subclass of claims that work in the way I have described . Call these fairness-claims ' . It might be a convenient piece of terminology to say that fairness is a subdivision of justice , and that justice is concerned with all claims , but fairness only with fairness-claims . Consequently , I can not pretend to have defined claims independently of the notion of fairness , and then shown how fairness applies to them . The subclass of claims I am talking about is partly identified by the way they work , and this is itself determined by the theory of fairness . Nevertheless , I believe the subclass of fairness-claims picked out this way is an important one . It may even include all claims . And for brevity I shall continue to use the term claim ' for fairness-claims only . The merit of the theory is that it shows a way claims can work , without // simply being weighed up in the manner of teleology , and also without being treated as side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grounds that teleology is mistaken . He concedes that these grounds are inadequate if there is a third alternative . ' My theory of fairness offers one . It shows how a claim can stop short of a right , considered as a side constraint . This fills a significant gap . It seems implausible that anyone has a right to a research grant from , say , the Ford Foundation . But if the Ford Foundation decides to distribute research grants , it should surely deal fairly with the applicants . Someone who was rejected on inadequate grounds would have a just complaint . But how can this be , if she had no right to a grant in the first place ? My theory explains how . If her application is good enough , she has a fairness-claim . Consequently , if other people are receiving a grant , she should receive one too . In Claims of need ' , David Wiggins considers just what sort of a claim is generated by need . Again , it seems implausible that a person has a right to whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suggest it might be a fairness-claim , which implies that , if needed resources are being distributed , the person should have a share . 7.5 Claims and lotteries Now let us concentrate once more on cases where the good to be distributed is indivisible , and there is not enough to go round . Take a case , first , where all the candidates have equal claims . It would be possible to satisfy their claims equally , as fairness requires , by denying the good to all of them . There may be occasions when it is so important to be fair that this is the right thing to do . But it would totally fail to meet the satisfaction requirement , and normally the demands of fairness will not be enough to outweigh this requirement completely . It will be better to use as much of the good as is available . In that case , the candidates ' claims can not all be equally satisfied , because some candidates will get the good and others will not . So some unfairness is inevitable . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each person can be given a sort of surrogate satisfaction . By holding a lottery , each can be given an equal chance of getting the good . This is not perfect fairness , but it meets the requirement of fairness to some extent . It does so , of course , only if giving a person a chance of getting the good counts as a surrogate satisfaction of her claim . This see4ns plausible to me . After all , if you have a chance of getting the good you may actually get it . It is quite different from merely giving the claim its proper weight against other reasons ; that does not satisfy it in any way . Suppose , in the example // of the dangerous mission , that the talented candidate was sent because of her talents . She could make the following complaint . She has as strong a claim to staying behind as anybody else . Her claim was weighed against other reasons . But this overrode her claim rather than satisfied it . It was never on the cards that she might actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she was sent because a lottery was held and she lost , she could make no such complaint . Next , take a case where several people have claims to a good that are roughly , but not exactly , equal . Perhaps , for instance , they all need the good , but not exactly equally . And suppose again that there is not enough to go round them all . Fairness requires satisfaction in proportion to their claims . So if the good goes to the people with the strongest claims , the others will not have been fairly treated ; their claims will have been overridden . And if it goes to other people , the unfairness will be worse . So unfairness is once again inevitable . But once again it can , if the circumstances are right , be mitigated by giving everyone a chance of getting the good . Ideally , each person 's chance should be in proportion to the strength of her claim : the lottery should be unequally weighted . ( At first , it is particularly puzzling how a weighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to have a greater chance than others , that means they more ought to have the good . So why not let them have it without a lottery ? My theory explains why not . ) But even a lottery at equal odds may be fairer than giving the good directly to the candidates with the strongest claims . This depends on a complicated judgement . The result of a lottery will generally be that the good goes to candidates who do not have the strongest claims . This is less fair than the result of giving it directly to those who do . The likelihood of this less fair result will have to be weighed against the contribution to fairness of the lottery itself . But it is clear that , if claims are close to equality , holding a lottery will be fairer than not . A subsidiary point . We have agreed that fairness requires everyone to have an equal chance when their claims are exactly equal . Then it is implausible it should require some people to have no chance at all when their claims fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or roughly equal , then , a lottery is fair . Whether it is right to hold one is then a matter of weighing the fairness it achieves against the likelihood that it will not meet the satisfaction requirement , which in this case requires the best candidates to be selected . The conclusion will depend on how important fairness is in the circumstances . But there will certainly be some circumstances where it is better to hold a lottery than to choose the best candidates deliberately . A lottery should be held when , first , it is important to be fair and , secondly , the candidates ' claims are equal or roughly equal . These conditions // may occur quite often . They do not require an exact balance of all considerations ; claims may be equal or roughly equal even when other considerations are not balanced at all . Consider , for instance , a life-saving medical treatment such as a kidney transplant . It seems plausible that , in a matter of life and death , fairness is particularly important . And it seems plausible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other grounds some are much better candidates than others . Maybe older candidates have weaker claims than younger , since they have already received a greater share of life . But , even so , the candidates ' claims may be nearly enough equal to make a lottery appropriate.10 This explains why a lottery may be better than the rule of picking the youngest . If an older person has a claim to the treatment , even if it is a weaker claim than a younger person 's , it demands proportional satisfaction . A lottery provides at least a surrogate satisfaction : a chance . But the rule of picking the youngest gives no sort of satisfaction at all . It simply overrides the claims of older people . So it is less fair . That is how my theory of fairness explains the value of lotteries . It satisfactorily accounts for the facts set out in section 7.2. 7.6 Other accounts of fairness I know no alternative theory that explains the value of lotteries as successfully as mine . I can not review all the alternatives here , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promising at first . " In section 7.1 , I spoke of the best ' candidates for a good , as though the notion was clear-cut . But when the judgement between candidates depends on comparing reasons of different sorts , it often seems impossible to weigh the reasons against each other in a precise way . How , for instance , when comparing candidates for life-saving treatment , should one 's joie de vivre be weighed against another 's family responsibilities ? The impossibility might be in the nature of things : some reasons might simply be incommensurable with each other . Or it might be practical : we might have no practical way of making the comparison accurately , even though in principle the reasons might be commensurable . This indeterminacy suggests the following defence of lotteries . A group of candidates might not be exactly tied ? all equally as good as the others ? but even so none might be definitely a better candidate than the others . Or it may be that some members of the group are actually better candidates than others , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only enough of the good for some of this group . Then , just as a lottery has a natural role as a tie breaker when there is an exact tie , it may be appropriate here for the same reason . Here we have a tie within the limits of comparability . And whereas I said in section 7.2 that an exact tie will be very rare , // a tie within the limits of comparability may be common . For life-saving medical treatment , for instance , once the medically unsuitable candidates , and perhaps the very old , have been eliminated , it may be that all the remaining candidates are tied within the limits of comparability . We may not be competent to judge between them . However , I do not think this argument accounts adequately for the value of lotteries . For one thing , it does not explain their fairness . As I said in section 7.2 , the role of a tie breaker is simply as a device for getting the decision made . No question of fairness need arise . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a device is needed to get the decision made when the weighing up of reasons has gone as far as it can . Furthermore , if there is no separate reason why a lottery is fair , it is doubtful that it is even going to be the best way of breaking the tie . A fixed rule may well do better , for the reason I gave in section 7.1 : it has some tendency to pick better candidates . Picking the youngest may well do better in the case of life-saving treatment . To be sure , this reason is more questionable in our present context . I said in section 7.1 that , in an arbitrary group of candidates for life saving , the younger ones are more likely to be better candidates than the older . Now , though , we are not dealing with an arbitrary group , but with a group that is tied within the limits of comparability . A candidate 's youth is one of the considerations that should already have been taken into account in admitting her to this group . Within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fewer other considerations in their favour than the older ones ; on balance , they should be no more likely to be good candidates . However , I doubt that in practice , when a lottery is defended on grounds of incomparability , it will often be for a group of people chosen in this finely balanced way . For instance , the group may consist of all the candidates except the medically unsuitable and the very old . For such a group , picking the youngest would be a better tie breaker than a lottery . In any case , this argument from incomparability provides no reason why a fixed rule should be worse than a lottery . It fails the test I mentioned at the end of section 7.1. 8 Is incommensurability vagueness ? 8.1 Indeterminate comparatives Which is more impressive : Salisbury Cathedral or Stonehenge ? I think there is no determinate answer to this question . The dyadic predicate more impressive than ' ? the comparative of the monadic predicate impressive ' ? seems to allow indeterminate cases . Many comparatives are like that . Amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , cleverer than ' , and the generic better than ' . For many comparatives , the indeterminacy arises because the compari son involves several factors or dimensions , and it is indeterminate exactly how the factors weigh against each other . The impressiveness of a building depends on some combination of its size , its importance in the landscape , the technological achievement it represents , and more , and it is inde terminate how these factors weigh against each other . Many evaluative comparatives are indeterminate for this reason . They depend on a combination of values , and it is indeterminate how the values are to be weighed . The values are incommensurable , we say . Not all indeterminate comparatives arise from incommensurable dimen sions , however . Redder than ' can also be indeterminate , even though it pre sumably does not involve several factors . Compare some reddish-purple patch of colour with some reddish-orange patch , and ask which is redder . The answer may be indeterminate . 123 // To make it clear : when I say a comparative Fer than ' is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a sort to which the predicate Fer ' can apply , there is no determinate answer to the question of which is Fer than which . Neither is Fer than the other , and nor are the two equally F. This chapter is about the logical structure of indeterminate comparatives , and in particular whether they are vague . The analysis is intended to apply to all indeterminate comparatives , but my chief interest is in the structure of evaluative and moral comparatives . I am particularly interested in the structure of better than ' . I shall argue that the indeterminacy of betterness is commonly misrepresented ; it does not take the form that is most commonly assumed for it . 8.2 Standard configurations I am going to set up a standard framework to use in the investigation . Before doing so I need to make a few preliminary points about the structure of comparatives . First , two formal features of the structure : Asymmetry of Fer than ' . For any x and y , if x is Fer than y , then y is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For any x , y , and z , if x is Fer than y and y is Fer than z , then x is Fer than z . I think these are principles of logic . If Fer than ' is indeterminate , that is no reason to doubt them . They are only conditional statements . Asymmetry requires that if x is Fer than y , then y is not Fer than x . With an indeterminate comparative , it may turn out for some xs and ys that x is not Fer than y and nor is y Fer than x ; this is consistent with asymmetry . Transitivity requires that if x is Fer than y and y is Fer than z , then x is Fer than z . If it turns out that neither x is Fer than y nor y Fer than x , then in this case transitivity is vacuously satisfied . My next point is that no comparative I can think of is indeterminate between every pair of things . For some pairs of colour patches , it is indeterminate which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pair is determinately redder than the other . A red patch is determinately redder than an orange patch , for instance . Salisbury Cathedral is determinately more impressive than Bath Abbey . For most comparatives Fer than ' , we can form whole chains of things , each of which is Fer than the next in the chain . A well-chosen chain may run from things that are very F to things that are not at all F. For instance , we could form a chain of colour patches , each redder than the next , starting from a pure red and running through orange to a yellow with no red in it at all . Churches could be arranged in a chain , each more impressive than the next . The chain might start with St // Peter 's , and end with some unimpressive chapel . Stonehenge would not be included in this chain . Take some chain ordered by Fer than ' . Then take something that is not included in the chain , and compare it with each of the things that are in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may turn out that there is no deter minate answer for any member of the chain . Compare Cantor 's diagonal proof that the real numbers are uncountable with churches in a chain . Which is more impressive ? You might conclude that proofs and churches in general are so different that they can never be determinately compared in terms of their impressiveness . Maybe so and maybe not . Things that are very different from the members of a chain are less likely to be comparable to these members than are similar things . But things that are not too different will normally be comparable to some extent . For instance , take a reddish-purple patch and compare it with the chain of patches I described that runs from red to yellow . The purple patch will be determinately comparable with some members of the chain . Patches at the top of the chain are redder than the purple patch , and the purple patch is redder than patches at the bottom of the chain . But somewhere in the middle there may well be patches where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think St Peter 's is more impressive than Stonehenge , and Stonehenge is more impressive than the gospel chapel in Stoke Pewsey , but for some churches in the chain the comparison with Stonehenge will be indeterminate . So as we move down a chain from top to bottom , compar ing its members in Fness with some object outside the chain , we may start in a zone where the members of the chain are Fer , then move into a zone where the comparison is indeterminate , and finally come to a zone where the other object is Fer . The aim of this chapter is to investigate what exactly goes on in the zone of indeterminacy . What is true of things in that zone , and what is not true ? To focus the discussion , I shall concentrate on a particular type of example , which I shall call a standard configuration ' . Here is one of the type . Take a chain of colour patches ranging from red through orange to yellow , each patch redder than the next . In fact , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour graded from red at the top to yellow at the bottom . Compare small patches or points of colour from this band with a single reddish-purple patch , and consider which is redder . At the top are points redder than the single patch and at the bottom points the single patch is redder than . A standard configuration for a comparative Fer than ' consists of a chain of things , fully ordered by their Fness and forming a continuum , and a fixed thing called the standard that is not itself in the chain . At the top of the chain are things Fer than the standard , and at the bottom things the stan126 The structure of good dard is Fer than . I shall refer to the things that make up the chain as points ' , whatever sort of thing they are . Two matters of clarification . There may be a zone of indeterminacy between the members of the chain that are Fer than the standard and those that the standard is Fer than , and I am particularly interested in cases where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not require there to be one . The second point is that the continuum of points may not exist in fact ; we may simply imagine it . For instance , actual churches do not form a continuum , but we can imagine a continuum of churches . Also , I have not defined what I mean by a continuum ' ; I hope I may leave that to intuition . The colour example is a standard configuration , and here is another . Suppose you have a choice between two careers , and you are wondering which is better . By this I mean : which would be the better one for you to take up . One offers travel and adventure , the other security and a regular income . Let us take the adventurous career as the standard , and form a continuous chain out of the other by varying the amount of income it offers . At the top of the chain are secure careers with a very high income , and let us suppose these are better than the adventurous career . At the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adventurous career is better than those . In the middle there may be a zone of indeterminacy . A third example . A government is wondering whether to preserve a stretch of rainforest , or open it up for commercial exploitation . Take as the standard the policy of preserving the forest . We can make a chain out of the exploitation option by imagining a range of economic benefits that might arise . Suppose that , if the benefits are enormous , exploitation is better , and , if the benefits are minute , preservation is better . Somewhere in between may be a zone of indeterminacy . A standard configuration is illustrated in figure 8.1 . Graphed against points in the chain , the figure shows truth values for the statements This point is Fer than the standard ' and ' The standard is Fer than this point ' . At the top of the chain is a zone of points with the property that they are Fer than the standard and the standard is not Fer than them . At the bottom is a zone of points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are not Fer than the standard . That is a constant feature of any standard configuration . But what happens between the top and the bottom zones ? There are a number of possibilities , which I shall describe in turn . In sections 8.9 and 8.10 , I shall discuss which of the possibilities are realized in actual English comparatives . // 8.3 No indeterminacy The first possibility is that there is no more than one point between the top zone and the bottom zone . It may be that , for every point in the chain , either it is Fer than the standard or the standard is Fer than it . Alternatively , there may be just one point for which this is not so . In both of these cases there is no indeterminacy . Let us call these type ( a ) determinacy and type ( b ) determinacy respectively . Figure 8.2 illustrates either . In type ( b ) determinacy , I assume the unique point must be equally as F as the standard . That is why I say these cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Fer than the standard , or the standard is Fer than it , or it is equally as Fas the standard . What justifies this assumption ? Not much , I am sorry to say , but here is my reason for adopting it . Take a standard configuration , and suppose one point in the chain is equally as F as the standard . Since higher points are Fer than this point , and this point is equally as F as the standard , it follows that higher points are Fer than the standard . This is an application of the principle : Extended transitivity of Fer than ' . For any x , y , and z , if x is Fer than y and y is equally as F as z , or if x is equally as F as y and y is Fer than z , then x is Fer than z . This is a small extension of the transitivity principle , and I take it too to be a principle of logic . The same extended transitivity implies that if one point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard is Fer than all lower points . So if one point is equally as F as the standard , then for every other point in the chain , either it is Fer than the standard or the standard is Fer than it . I am inclined to believe the converse . That is : if , for every point in a continu128 The structure of good ous chain bar one , either it is Fer than the standard or the standard is Fer than it , but for one point this is not so , then I am inclined to believe this one point must be equally as F as the standard . In fact , I am inclined to believe that equally as F as ' is not an independent notion at all , but can be defined in terms of Fer than . I would say that x is equally as F as y ' means that x is not Fer than y , and y is not Fer than x , and anything that is Fer than x is also Fer than y , and y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the basis of my assumption that , in type ( b ) determinacy , the unique point is equally as F as the standard . I have no argument for it , but I can think of no counterexample. 8.4 Hard indeterminacy The next possibility is that there is more than one point in the chain such that it is not Fer than the standard and the standard is not Fer than it . All the points with this property form a central zone . None of them can be equally as F as the standard . If one was , I showed in section 8.3 that all points above it would be Fer than the standard and the standard would be Fer than all points below it . Then only this one point would have the property that it is not Fer than the standard and the stan dard is not Fer than it . But our assumption is that there is more than one point with this property . The whole central zone , then , constitutes a zone of indeterminacy . If there is more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the standard , and the standard is not Fer than it , I shall say that Fer than ' has hard indeterminacy . Hard indeterminacy is not vagueness . It is definite that points within the zone of indeterminacy are not Fer than the standard and the standard is not Fer than them . However , it is natural to think there is often something // vague about an indeterminate comparative . Take redder than ' , for instance . Redder than the standard ' is a monadic predicate , and it is natural to think it may be vague , like the predicate red ' . Start from the top of the chain in the standard configuration I described , which runs from red to yellow . Points at the top of the chain are red , and it seems implausible that as we move down the chain we encounter a sharp boundary that divides these points that are red from those that are not red . Similarly , points at the top are redder than the standard ( which is reddish-purple and not in the chain itself ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we move down the chain , we encounter a sharp boundary that divides these points that are redder than this standard from points that are not redder than it . Instead , it seems there may be a zone of vagueness between the points that are redder than the standard and those that are not . For many comparatives Fer than ' , it seems plausible that there is an zone of vagueness between points that are Fer than the standard and points that are not . There seems also to be an area of vagueness at the bottom of the zone of indeterminacy , between points the standard is not Fer than , and those it is . Is vagueness like this compatible with hard indeterminacy ? At first it seems it should be . Hard indeterminacy simply says there is a zone where points are not Fer than the standard and the standard is not Fer than them . The vagueness I have just described is around the borders of this zone . The suggestion is that the borders are vague rather than sharp . The zone of indeterminacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there seems nothing wrong with that . However , oddly enough , it turns out that this can not be so . The boundaries of the zone of indeterminacy must be sharp rather than vague , for the following reason . Take any point somewhere around the top boundary of the zone of indeterminacy . Clearly , it is false that the standard is Fer than this point , since this is false for all points in the zone of indeterminacy and above . If it is also false that this point is Fer than the standard , then the point is squarely within the zone of indeterminacy . If , on the other hand , it is true that this point is Fer than the standard , then it is squarely within the top zone . So if there is really a zone of vagueness , for points in this zone it must be neither true nor false that they are Fer than the standard . But now we can apply something I call the collapsing principle : The collapsing principle , special version . For any x and y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x and , not false that x is Fer than y , then it is true that x is Fer than y . This principle is crucial to the argument of this chapter . I shall defend it in the next section , and here I shall simply apply it . I have just said that , for a point in the zone of vagueness , if there is such a zone , it is false that the standard is l-cr than it , but not false that it is Fer than the standard . Then // according to the collapsing principle , it is true that it is Fer than the standard . This implies it is not in a zone of vagueness after all . So there is no such zone . Figure 8.3 shows hard indeterminacy . As we move down the chain from the top , starting with points that are Fer than the standard , we suddenly come to ones that are not Fer than the standard . Later , having found only points that the standard is not Fer than , we suddenly encounter ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has hard indeterminacy is a strict partial ordering without vagueness. 8.5 The collapsing principle The proof in the previous section depended crucially on the collapsing prin ciple . Now I need to justify it . My only real argument is this . If it is false that y is Fer than x , and not false that x is Fer than y , then x has a clear advantage over y in respect of its Fness . So it must be Fer than y . It only takes the slightest asymmetry to make it the case that one thing is Fer than another . One object is heavier than another if the scales tip ever so slightly towards it . Here there is a clear asymmetry between x and y in respect of their Fness . That is enough to determine that x is Fer than y . I find this obvious , and here is a thought-experiment to reinforce its obvi ousness . Suppose you had to award a prize to either x or y for its Fness . Suburbs in Canberra are named after great Australians , and each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not yet have a suburb . Suppose there are two candidates for the next suburb , and you have to decide between them . Suppose that , on investigating their cases , you con clude it is false that Wye is a greater Australian than Exe , but that it is not false that Exe is a greater Australian than Wye . This is not at all like the case // where you conclude that Wye and Exe are equally great Australians , because then it is not clear who should get the suburb ; you should probably toss a coin . Nor is it like the case where you conclude that neither Wye nor Exe is greater than the other and they are not equally great either . This is a case squarely in the zone of indeterminacy . In this case , it is once again not clear who should get the suburb , just because neither candidate is better than the other . Perhaps you should toss a coin in this case too , or perhaps some other procedure would be right . But when it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false that Exe is greater than Wye , you need not hesitate . It would be quite wrong to give the suburb to Wye . Since the prize was for being the greater Australian , it could not be so obvious who should win unless that person was the greater Australian . When it is false that y is Fer than x but not false that x is Fer than y , then if you had to award a prize for Fness , it is plain you should give the prize to x . But it would not be plain unless x was Fer than y . Therefore x is Fer than y . This must be so whether actually you have to give a prize or not , since whether or not you have to give a prize can not affect whether or not x is Fer than y. 8.6 Soft indeterminacy What other options are there for the structure of a comparative Fer than ' ? No other option can allow the existence of points in the chain such that they are not Fer than the standard and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such that it is false that they are Fer than the standard and false that the standard is Fer than them ) . That would be hard indeterminacy . But it might be possible for there to be points such that it is neither true nor false that they are Fer than the standard , and neither true nor false that the standard is Fer than them . There could be a zone of indeterminacy composed of points like this . I call this case soft indeterminacy . None of the points in the zone of indeterminacy can be equally as F as the standard , since if a point was equally as F as the standard it would be false that it was better than the standard , whereas it is not false . Therefore , the zone of indeterminacy must have more than one point in it . If there were only one point , I argued in section 8.3 that it would have to be equally as F as the standard . But I have just said this is impossible . Unlike hard indeterminacy , which has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of indeterminacy is also a zone of vagueness . For any point in the zone , it is vague whether or not it is Fer than the standard , and vague whether or not the standard is Fer than it . The possible structures of a softly indeterminate comparative are severely limited . Once again , it is chiefly the collapsing principle that limits them . One limit is that , for any point , it is neither true nor false that it is Fer // than the standard if and only if it is neither true nor false that the standard is Fer than it . So the entire zone of indeterminacy necessarily has vagueness of both sorts ; the comparison is vague taken either way . Here is the proof . First , suppose some point is Fer than the standard and it is neither true nor false that the standard is Fer than it . Since this point is Fer than the standard , the asymmetry of Fer than ' implies the standard is not Fer than it . This contradicts that it is neither true nor false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose a point is not Fer than the standard and it is neither true nor false that the standard is Fer than it . From this supposition , the special version of the collapsing principle , stated in section 8.4 , implies that the standard is Fer than the point . That contradicts that it is neither true nor false that the standard is Fer than it . The rest of the proof is a matter of ringing the changes . Another limit on the structure of softly indeterminate comparatives is imposed by a more general version of the collapsing principle . My statement of this version needs a preface . I intend it to be neutral between competing theories of vagueness . It uses the expression more true than ' , but this is not to be read as implying the existence of degrees of truth as they are usually understood . Its meaning is wider . For instance , if P is true and Q is false , then I would say P is more true than Q. If P is neither true nor false , and Q is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Q. In this case , P is certainly less false than Q , and I intend more true ' to include less false ' . If P is definitely true and Q is not definitely true , I would again say that P is more true than Q. In general , I will say P is more true than Q whenever P in any way rates more highly than Q in respect of its truth . Now , the principle is : The collapsing principle , general version . For any x and y , if it is more true that x is Fer than y than that y is Fer than x , then x is Fer than y . ' The argument for it is the same as the one I gave in section 8.5 for the special version . Remember that this principle is specifically about reciprocal comparative statements . I do not endorse the general claim that if any statement P is more true than another statement Q then P is true , nor the different specific claim that if P is more true than its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more dead than alive , I do not believe she is necessarily dead . The general version of the collapsing principle implies that for no point in the zone of indeterminacy can it be more true that the point is Fer than the standard than that the standard is Fer than it . Nor can it be less true . This leaves open several possibilities , corresponding to different theories of vagueness . One theory is that when statements are vague they have no truth value . Figure 8.4 illustrates how soft indeterminacy will appear from this point of view ; I have called it type ( a ) soft indeterminacy . Evidently , it is // consistent with the collapsing principle . According to other theories , vague statements may have some other truth value besides true or false . It would be consistent with the collapsing principle for This point is Fer than the standard ' and The standard is Fer than this point ' to have the same truth value throughout the zone of indeterminate . It might be indefinite ' , say , or some particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have called it type ( b ) soft indeterminacy . 8.7 Incomparable truth values Both types ( a ) and ( b ) of soft indeterminacy fail to capture one natural intuition . For any point in the zone of indeterminacy , it is neither true nor false that it is Fer than the standard . But intuition suggests that in some sense or other the statement This point is Fer than the standard ' is more true for points near the top of the zone than for points near the bottom . For points near the top , indeed , it seems it must be almost true they are Fer than the standard , and for points near the bottom it seems this must be almost false . This intuition clearly implies that statements can be true to a greater or lesser degree . So in order to discuss it , I shall have to give up my attempt to be neutral amongst competing theories of vagueness . For this discussion , I shall take it for granted that there are degrees of truth . Anyway , the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y . This implies that x has redness to a greater degree than y has it , so there are degrees of redness . ' But it seems also to imply that x is red more than y is red , which in turn surely implies that x is red ' is truer than y is red ' , so there are degrees of truth . I shall say more about this in section 8.8 . Other sorts of comparisons perhaps point more clearly to degrees of truth , because they // more clearly compare statements . It 's raining more than it 's snowing ' seems clearly to imply that It 's raining ' is truer than It 's snowing . ' One intuition , then , is that as we move from point to point up through the zone of indeterminacy , This point is Fer than the standard ' becomes progressively more true and The standard is Fer than this point ' pro progressively less true . At first , this intuition seems to be inconsistent with the collapsing principle . It seems to imply that , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter points for which This point is Fer than the standard ' is more true than The standard is Fer than this point . ' But then the collapsing principle will kick in and say these points must actually be determinately Fer than the standard : they are not in the zone of inde terminacy after all . However , a point made by Adam Morton can be used to show this need not happen.3 It may be that the truth values of This point is Fer than the standard ' and The standard is Fer than this point ' are incomparable throughout the zone of indeterminacy , but nevertheless one of these state ments may increase in truth value as we move up through the zone and the other decrease . The reason this seems impossible at first is that we tradition-ally think of degrees of truth as numbers between zero and one . At least , we assume they are linearly ordered . If degrees are linearly ordered , every degree is comparable with every other . But degrees are not linearly ordered , and there really are incomparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . I have already assumed that , if x is redder than y , xis red ' is truer than y is red ' . We know already that in many cases it is indeterminate which of x and y is redder . In those cases it must be indeterminate which of x is red ' and y is red ' is truer . So , because comparatives can be indeterminate , degrees of truth can be incomparable . Given that , there is no reason why it should not be inde terminate which of This point is Fer than the standard ' and The standard // is Fer than this point ' is truer . This gives us a type ( c ) of soft indeterminacy . I have illustrated it as well as I can in figure 8.6 , but the illustration is inad equate because I can find no way of showing the truth values of the two statements varying through the zone of indeterminacy . Type ( c ) indeterminacy raises a more complex question . If it is inde terminate which of two statements ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and The standard is Fer than this point ' ? is truer , just what sort of indeterminacy is this ? This is a question about the structure of the compar ative truer than ' : does it have hard or soft indeterminacy in this application ? I suggest it has soft indeterminacy , on grounds of uniformity . The statement x is Fer than y ' implies x is F is truer than y is F. So if Fer than ' is softly indeterminate , truer than ' must be softly indeterminate between statements of the form x is F. My suggestion is that it is also softly indeterminate between statements of the form x is Fer than y ' ( such as , This point is Fer than the standard ' ) or equivalently between statements of the form " x is F is truer than y is F ' . I also suggest it is softly indeterminate between state ments at the next level of complexity : statements of the form " xis F is truer than y is F " is truer than " y is F @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suggest we find only soft indeterminacy as we iterate to infinity . ' My reason is that I would expect truer than ' to have a uniform structure wherever it is used . Type ( c ) soft indeterminacy satisfies our intuitions to some extent , but not completely . One intuition is that , as we move up through the zone of indeterminacy , it becomes progressively more true that the points we encounter are Fer than the standard , and progressively less true that the standard is Fer than them . Type ( c ) indeterminacy reconciles this idea with the collapsing principle . But another intuition is that , as we get near the top of the zone , it becomes nearly true that the points we encounter are Fer than the standard , and nearly false that the standard is Fer than them . I think this really is inconsistent with the collapsing principle . If one statement is // nearly true and another nearly false , it is surely undeniable that the first is truer than the second . Other degrees of truth might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly false ' are plainly comparable . So the intuition suggests that , for points near the top of the zone , it is truer that they are Fer than the standard than that the standard is Fer than them . This drags in the collapsing principle in the usual way , and leads to a contradiction . So , even in type ( c ) indeterminacy , at the boundary of the zone of indeterminacy , This point is Fer than the standard ' changes its truth value sharply . At the top boundary its value drops from true to some degree that is not nearly true . 8.8 Supervaluation The most widely held theory of vagueness is supervaluation theory . ' If we take this theory on board , what can we add to the analysis ? When a term is vague , there are various ways it could acceptably be made sharp . Suppose Fer than ' is vague ? softly indeterminate that is ? and in particular suppose it is vague whether xis Fer than y . Then if Fer than ' was sharpened in one direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was sharpened in another direction , y would be Fer than x . I shall confine the word ' sharpening ' to sharpenings that are complete : they are not themselves vague , that is to say . According to supervaluation theory : Supervaluation . A statement containing a vague term is true if and only if it is true under all acceptable sharpenings of the term . The sharpenings of a vague comparative Fer than ' will be comparatives . Since they are not themselves vague , they must either be fully determinate , or have hard indeterminacy . Which will it be ? I can not rule out either possibility on logical grounds . A vague comparative may have as its sharpenings both determinate comparatives and comparatives with hard indeterminacy . Alternatively , a vague comparative may have only determinate comparatives as its sharpenings . However , I can show that no vague comparative can have only comparatives with hard indeterminacy as its sharpenings ; at least some of its sharpenings must be determinate . Here is the demonstration . Suppose every sharpening of Fer than ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points ' as I shall call them . The lower switch point is where The standard is Fer than this point ' switches from true to false as we move up the chain ; the upper switch point is where This point is Fer than the standard ' switches from false to true . For every sharpening there is a gap between these switch points . Now think about the top end of the zone of indeterminacy . Every sharpening // must have its upper switch point within the zone . So every sharpening must have its lower switch point a definite distance below the top of the zone . Consequently , there will be some points within the zone that are above the lower switch point of every sharpening . ( I shall ignore the mathematical possibility that there might be a sequence of sharpenings such that the distance between their switch points tends to zero ; this is uninteresting . ) For these points , every sharpening makes it false that the standard is Fer than them . That is , every sharpening makes it true that the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely true that the standard is Fer than them . But in the zone of indeterminacy this is not so . So there is a contradiction . Why does it matter what sort of indeterminacy the sharpenings have ? If all the sharpenings of a softly indeterminate comparative were determinate , we could draw a striking conclusion . In every sharpening of Fer than ' , it would be true of every point that either it is Fer than the standard , or the standard is Fer than it , or that it and the standard are equally F. Since this would be true of every point in every sharpening , according to supervaluation theory it would simply be true of every point . Even when Fer than ' is softly indeterminate , it would nevertheless be the case for every point that either it is Fer than the standard , or the standard is Fer than it , or it and the standard are equally F. This may seem puzzling , since for any point in the zone of indeterminacy , we know already it is not true that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not true that the standard is Fer than the point , and it is not true that the point and the standard are equally F. Since none of these three things is true , how can their disjunction be true ? The answer is : in the same way as the law of the excluded middle is true according to supervaluation theory . If F is vague , then for some x it may not be true that x is F nor true that x is not F. Nevertheless , according to supervaluation theory , the disjunction is true : x is either F or not F , since this disjunction is true in every sharpening.6 So , if every sharpening of a softly indeterminate comparative were determinate , the contrast between hard determinacy and soft determinacy would be particularly stark . In hard indeterminacy , no point in the zone of indeterminacy is Fer than the standard , and nor is the standard Fer than it , and nor are it and the standard equally F. In soft indeterminacy , for every point , either it is Fer than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or it and the standard are equally F. Now , what version of soft indeterminacy does supervaluation theory support ? Many supervaluationists refuse to recognize degrees of truth , ' and that suggests they would adopt type ( a ) as their version . But we may make a small and readily acceptable addition to the theory : // Greatervaluation . One statement P , containing a vague term , is truer than another Q if P is true in every sharpening that makes Q true , and also true in some sharpening that does not make Q true . When people dislike the idea of degrees of truth , I think that is generally because they assume degrees must be linearly ordered . Greatervaluation does not imply that . I only offer greatervaluation as a sufficient condition for P to be truer than Q. It is not a necessary condition , as this example shows . Compare a reddish-orange patch with a pure orange patch . The former is redder than the latter . Consequently , it is more true that the former is red than that the latter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language in which it is true that the former is red . Now , take a pair of points , one higher in the zone of indeterminacy than the other . Any sharpening that makes the lower point Fer than the standard will also make the higher point Fer than the standard , but there the standard . So according to greatervaluation , it is more true that the higher point is Fer than the standard than that the lower point is . Similarly , it is more true that the standard is Fer than the lower point than that it is Fer than the higher point . As we move up through the zone , then , it becomes progressively more true that the points we encounter are Fer than the standard , and progressively less true that the standard is Fer than them . This implies type ( c ) indeterminacy , so greatervaluation supports this type . 8.9 Ordinary comparatives are softly indeterminate I have now laid out the possible structures a comparative might have . What structures do we find amongst our ordinary comparatives ? I particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . Without doubt , there are comparatives that have no indeterminacy . Heavier than ' is one . Are there comparatives with hard indeterminacy ? A comparative with hard indeterminacy is a strict partial ordering without vagueness . There are plenty of such orderings around ; the question is whether any of them are the comparatives of monadic predicates . It may be possible to construe some of them artificially as comparatives , by deriving monadic predicates from them . For instance , let us say that one object is mucheavier than another if and only if it is more than one kilo heavier than the other . Then the relation mucheavier than ' is a strict partial ordering without vagueness . Let us say it is the comparative of a monadic predicate mucheavy ' . Then mucheavy ' is a predicate whose comparative // has hard indeterminacy . However , I am not convinced that the predicate mucheavy ' really exists . The only property of objects that is involved in the relation mucheavier than ' is their heaviness . The objects have no separate property that a predicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no such predicate . I do not think mucheavier than ' is the comparative of any predicate ; instead it is a fragment of the genuine comparative heavier than ' , the comparative of heavy ' . Or take another example of a strict partial ordering without vagueness . Let us say that one option is Pareto-better ' than another if and only if it is better for someone and not worse for anyone . Pareto-betterness defined this way is a strict partial ordering , and for the sake of argument let us assume it is not vague . Could we define a monadic predicate Pareto-good ' to have Pareto-better than ' as its comparative ? Once again , I am doubtful . The only property of options that seems to be in play is their goodness . Paretobetterness is best understood as a partial , sufficient criterion for better than ' , the comparative of goodness , rather than as itself the complete comparative of anything . There are people who think that Paretobetterness is actually a complete criterion for betterness , so that one option is better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not worse for anyone . These people do not try to construct an artificial predicate out of the relation Pareto-better than ' . Instead they think that better than ' , the comparative of the natural predicate good ' , happens to be extensionally equivalent to Pareto-better than ' . If they were right , better than ' would have hard indeterminacy , but I shall say in section 8.10 why I think are wrong . These examples suggest to me that constructing artificial comparatives with hard indeterminacy may not be as easy as it seems . But I do not insist they can not be constructed . Perhaps they can . I am interested in our ordinary , natural comparatives . Do any of them have hard indeterminacy ? I find it implausible that any do . My reasons are these . First , the difficulty of finding artificial comparatives with hard indeterminacy suggests to me there is something fishy about hard indeterminacy in general . A comparative with hard indeterminacy is incomplete , and that suggests it may be a fragment of a complete comparative rather than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I showed in section 8.4 that if a comparative has hard indeterminacy it can not be vague . I find it implausible that indeterminate comparatives are not vague at all . If a comparative has hard indeterminacy , then , as we move down from the top of a chain in a standard configuration , there comes a point where This point is Fer than the standard ' suddenly changes from true to false . So the monadic predicate Fer than the standard ' is sharp and not vague . I find this implausible l r indeterminate comparatives . Why ? I do not think // it is as obvious as the vagueness of many predicates . Take red ' , for instance . If we move down a continuous chain of colour-patches from pure red to yellow , it seems obvious that there is no point in the chain where the patches suddenly cease to be red . Therefore , red ' is vague . But a predicate of the form Fer than the standard ' can not be quite so obviously vague , because it will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance . Take the chain of colours from red to yellow , and for a moment let the standard be a patch that exactly matches some point in the chain . Then higher points are redder than the standard and lower points are not redder than the standard , and the transition is sharp . Since there is a sharp transition for certain standards , it is not perfectly obvious that there is no sharp transition for other standards . Notice first about this example that it has no indeterminacy . The point in the chain that exactly matches the standard is equally as red as the standard . Higher points are redder than the standard , and the standard is redder than lower points . So this is not an example of hard indeterminacy . Moreover , I am sure there is no sharp transition when the standard is , say , reddish-purple , and does not match a point in the chain . The reason is that , if there is a sharp transition , I can not tell where it is . I know no way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who can detect where it is . If there is a point of transition , it is undetectable , and I do not believe redness can have an undetectable boundary of this sort . The same goes for every other natural indeterminate comparative I can think of , including evaluative ones . I think ordinary indeterminate comparatives are softly indeterminate . Admittedly , even soft indeterminacy has a sharp boundary of a sort . There is a sharp boundary between points where This point is Fer than the standard ' is true and points where it is not true . I find it hard to believe in a sharp transition of this sort . It is the collapsing principle that demands it , and this implication of the principle is paradoxical . The principle implies there are sharp boundaries where there seem to be none . I am recommending soft rather than hard indeterminacy as the lesser of two evils . It certainly is the lesser evil . In soft indeterminacy the sharp transition is between points where This point is Fer than the standard ' is true and points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is between points where this statement is true and points where it is false . So the transition in soft indeterminacy is not so abrupt . Furthermore , in type ( c ) soft indeterminacy , This point is Fer than the standard ' becomes less and less true as we move down through the zone of indeterminacy . This makes the transition even softer . In this respect type ( c ) is the least paradoxical type of soft indeterminacy . // 8.10 Other views Many authors have described indeterminacy in a way that implies or suggests it is hard . Remember that in section 8.4 I defined a comparative Fer than ' to have hard indeterminacy if and only if there is more than one point in a chain such that it is not Fer than the standard and the standard is not her than it . I explained in section 8.4 that none of these points can be equally as F as the standard , and I explained in section 8.3 that if there is only one point in a chain such that it is not Fer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then it will be equally as F as the standard . So ' Fer than ' has hard indeterminacy if and only if there is a point in the chain such that it is not Fer than the standard , and the standard is not Fer than it , and it is not equally as F as the standard . But most authors take it for granted that indeterminate comparatives will satisfy a condition like this . For instance , Christopher Peacocke argues that redder than ' is indeterminate , and says of two colour-patches that neither is red to a greater degree than the other , nor are they equally red ' .8 Joseph Raz says that when A and B are incommensurable it is generally false that of A and B either one is better than the other or they are of equal value ' .9 When goods are incommensurable , I myself have said neither alternative will be better for the person and they will not be equally good for her either ' .10 I could find many more examples . All these authors seem to imply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are seriously attached to this view . For one thing , there is a way of reading most of their statements that makes them consistent with soft indeterminacy . When Peacocke says that neither object is red to a greater degree than the other , and nor are they equally red , I read him as meaning it is false that either object is red to a greater degree than the other and false that they are equally red . But he could also be read as saying it is not true that either object is red to a greater degree than the other , and not true that they are equally red . This allows the possibility that these statements are neither true nor false , which is consistent with soft indeterminacy . ( Raz , though , deliberately rules out this alternative reading . ) More important , these authors have not realized that hard indeterminacy in a comparative is incompatible with vagueness . I am sure that , once they realize it , they will have no inclination to believe in hard indeterminacy any more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeterminacy is normally soft . There is a tradition in economics ? inspired by Amartya Sen ? of representing certain comparatives by means of strict partial orderings without vagueness ) I For instance , Sen himself uses a strict partial ordering to represent more unequal than ' ( applied to distributions of income ) , 12 and in // another place to represent socially preferred to ' , which I take to mean simply better than ' .13 This seems to imply hard indeterminacy . But actually I do not think Sen necessarily has hard indeterminacy in mind . Let us look at one of his arguments . ' 4 Suppose we have to compare various alternative arrangements for society , where some are better for some people and others better for others . To judge which are better than which , we have to weigh some people 's good against others ' . Suppose we can not do this weighing precisely , but we can do it roughly . There is a range of weights we might give to each person ; we should use weights from this range , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each person , we picked one weight from her range , so we had a set of weights , one for each person , that set would determine a complete ordering of the options . If we picked a different set of weights , that would determine a different complete ordering . Suppose we go through all the combinations of possible weights ; each will determine a complete ordering . Now let us say one option is clearly above ' another if and only if it is above the other in all these orderings . Clearly above ' is then a strict partial ordering without vagueness , and Sen takes it to represent betterness . Does this mean he thinks better than ' is not vague ? I can see no evidence for that . Sen says one option is better than another if it is clearly above the other , but I doubt he would insist that one option is not better than another if it is not clearly above the other . If neither of two options is clearly above the other , he does not tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell us , it would be most natural for him to adopt soft indeterminacy . His explanation of how betterness comes to be a partial ordering is close to supervaluation theory . When applied to alternative arrangements for society , we can say that better than ' is vague because it is indeterminate how we should weigh together the good of different people . Within the appropriate range , each set of weights constitutes a sharpening of better than ' . Supervaluation says it is true that one option is better than another if and only if it is true in all sharpenings . Apparently Sen agrees . Supervaluation also says it is true that one option is not better than another if and only if that is true in all sharpenings . Sen does not state a necessary condition for one option not to be better than another , but it would be natural for him to agree to this too . If he did , he would have adopted soft indeterminacy . When Sen says betterness is a partial ordering , I do not think that is meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account were consistently completed , it would amount to soft indeterminacy . But what of the hard-liner who believes one person 's good can never be weighed against another 's to determine what is better overall ? Suppose this person thinks one option is better than another if and only if it is better iiir // someone and no worse for anyone . Between any pair of options that are not related in this way , suppose she thinks it false that either is better than the other or that they are equally good . She thinks the relation I called earlier Pareto-better than ' is actually the whole of ' better than ' , the comparative of good ' . It is a strict partial ordering , and let us suppose once again it is not vague . This person unequivocally thinks that better than ' has hard indeterminacy . My answer to this person is that her position is too implausible to be correct . I could understand someone who thinks there is no such thing as goodness , viewed from a neutral perspective , so that no option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain better , rather than , say , better for a particular person . But our hard-liner recognizes the existence of goodness ; she simply thinks it can never be determined by weighing one person 's good against another 's . Now imagine some piece of good fortune could befall either of two people . Suppose neither of them has any particular entitlement to it . One would scarcely benefit from it at all because she has already received her fill of good fortune . The other would benefit tremendously ; the good fortune would lift her from grinding poverty to a comfortable and enjoyable life . Would it be better for the first to receive the good fortune or the second ? If you do not believe in goodness , you will think this question meaningless . But if you recognize goodness , you can not plausibly deny the question has an answer : the second person . So , if goodness exists , then sometimes it can be determined by weighing together the good of different people . Once you acknowledge that , you will have to recognize borderline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good should be weighed . You will have to acknowledge vagueness in better than ' , and that makes it softly indeterminate . 8.10 Conclusion So indeterminate comparatives are softly indeterminate , and that includes better than ' . What conclusions can we draw ? I shall talk about betterness only . One is that the commonest formulations of indeterminateness are incorrect or at least misleading . When it is indeterminate which of two things is better , people commonly say that , of two options , neither is better than the other and they are not equally good either . This suggests it is false that either is better than the other , and false that they are equally good . But in a standard configuration , when a point in the zone of indeterminacy is compared with the standard , it is not false that it is better than the standard , and it is not false that the standard is better than it . Indeed , there are grounds for saying that either one is better than the other , or they are equally good . These grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I introduced supervaluation , I showed that some of the sharpenings of a particular comparative must be fully determinate . But I could not rule out on logical grounds the possibility that some of them might have hard indeterminacy . But by now I think I can plausibly rule it out on other grounds . I have not found any indubitable cases of hard indeterminacy even amongst artificial comparatives , and I very much doubt that any exist amongst natural comparatives . So it seems reasonable to doubt that they exist amongst the sharpenings of vague comparatives . If so , all sharpenings of better than ' must be fully determinate . In that case , I explained in section 8.8 that , for every point in a chain , either it is better than the standard , or the standard is better than it , or it is equally as good as the standard . When it is indeterminate which of two things is better , their goodness is in a sense incomparable . But the conclusion I have just drawn makes it clear that in other senses it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supervaluation theory , just recognizing that soft indeterminacy is a sort of vagueness should make you recognize a sort of comparability . When it is indeterminate which of two things is better , it is not true that one is better than the other , but it is also not false . Furthermore , if the indeterminacy is type ( c ) , then it is true to some degree that one is better than the other . And if one of the things improves a little , it will then be more true that it is better than the other . All these are facts about the things ' comparative goodness . 9 Incommensurable values 9.1 The idea of incommensurability You might join the army or you might become a priest . Which would be better ? Intuitively it seems this question may have no determinate answer ; the values realized by these two careers seem to be so very different that they can not be weighed against each other in a precise way . In some circum stances there will be a determinate answer to the question ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like guns . But , in more balanced circum stances , it will not be determinate which is the better option . This phe nomenon of indeterminacy is often called the incommensurability ' of values . It is often thought to be a central feature of ethical life . James Griffin has taken up the subject of incommensurability several times during his career . ' He is not enthusiastic about its importance , and even casts some doubt on its existence . ' He points out , first , that what many philosophers have called incommensurability ' is not really that at all , or ought not to be called that . Incommensurability ' ought to be reserved for cases where alternatives are incomparable ' as Griffin puts it , by which he means that they can not be put in an order . When a philosopher says the value of free speech is incommensurable with the pleasure of eating pizza , she means that free speech is immeasurably more valuable than this plea-sure . That is to say , free speech and this pleasure can be ordered , emphat ically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any large amount of pizza-pleasure . This is not really incommensurability but extreme commensurability . Griffin mentions other misuses of the term too . If we set the misuses aside , and concentrate on true incommensurability , he thinks it may be hard to find any . 145 // So values are commensurable in Griffin 's sense if alternatives can be ordered . It is not the values themselves that can be ordered . Griffin is not interested in ordering enjoyment and understanding ? to take two of his examples of values . These values can not be ordered ? neither is better than the other ? because they come in various amounts . Wren 's enjoyment in designing St Paul 's is better than understanding Article iv of section 3.8 of Regulation 294 issued by DG65 of the European Union , whereas understanding evolution is better than enjoying a pizza . So we can not order the values of enjoyment and understanding themselves . But we might be able to order events that realize these values , such as designing St Paul 's or eating a pizza . Each event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the values are commensurable , that means they can be measured on the same scale . So a degree of one can be compared , as greater or less , with a degree of the other . Consequently the events can be ordered . We often need to compare other things besides events , so for generality I shall say that options ' can be ordered , without specifying what sort of options . To claim that values are commensurable is to claim that options can be ordered . Ordered with respect to what ? Their goodness . Values are goods of different sorts , which contribute to the goodness of the options that realize them . To say that values are commensurable is to say that options are ordered by their goodness . Griffin himself sometimes seems not to have recognized clearly enough that it is options rather than values themselves that need to be ordered . As part of his argument against incommensurable values , he mentions that we can and do compare values . We can and do compare pain and accomplishment . If the pain is great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider this accomplishment worth the pain . ' 3 But this is beside the point . Undoubtedly , some amount of pain-avoidance can be compared with some amount of accomplishment ; indeed there may be no two values such that some amount of one can not be compared with some amount of the other . Perhaps all values are commensurable in this sense . But we are not interested in comparing values themselves ; we need to compare options that realize values . Options realize values to various degrees . A great accomplishment achieved with a little pain is better than painlessly accomplishing nothing . And painlessly accomplishing nothing is better than very painfully accomplishing very little . But if pain and accomplishment are to be thoroughly commensurable , any amount of painavoidance must be comparable with any amount of accomplishment , so that all options that realize pain-avoidance or accomplishment to any degree can be ordered by their goodness . Still , despite this slip , Griffin does correctly identify the question of commensurability as a question of ordering options . Actually , the ordering // of options is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask whether values are commensurable is implicitly to make a presumption about the way individual values combine together to determine the overall goodness of an option . It is to presume that the goodness of an option is determined by the various values it realizes , acting independently of each other . If that is so , and if these independent values are commensurable ? so they can be measured on the same scale ? then they can be added up to determine the overall value of the option . But actually the value of an option maybe determined in a complex fashion by the interaction of values with each other and with other features of the option that are not themselves values . If values and other features interact like this , the notion of commensurability is obscure . But the question of ordering remains clear . However complex the determination of goodness , we can ask whether options are ordered by their goodness . This question of ordering is the subject of this chapter , though I shall use the terms commensurability ' and incommensurability ' loosely to refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions . First , are options always ordered by their goodness ? Secondly , if they are not , how important is that fact in ethics ? Section 9.4 aims to answer the first question , and section 9.10 returns to it ; sections 9.5 to 9.10 aim to answer the second . But before coming to the two substantive questions , I need to deal with some formal matters in sections 9.2 and 9.3 . I have suggested that options might or might not be ordered by their goodness . What , exactly , is the difference ? 9.2 The standard configuration I find a particular formal device useful for answering this question ; I call it a standard configuration ' .4 Take the career example again . You have a choice between joining the church and joining the army . In practice there is bound to be a great deal of uncertainty about how each of these careers will progress if you choose it . But for simplicity let us ignore that ; imagine each can be accurately predicted . So you have a choice between a particular career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a particular career as a priest , also mapped out . Now , imagine variations in the church career that make it better or worse . For instance , imagine the community becomes more religious , which makes for a better career , or less religious , which makes for a worse one . Think of a whole sequence of imaginary church careers , each a little bit better than the previous one in the sequence . I shall call this sequence a chain ' . Next , fill in the spaces in the chain till we have fully continuous variations in goodness as we move along it . For instance , imagine continuous variations in the community 's religiousness . Then our chain call he represented as a continuous line like this : // f- worse better -3 Possible careers as a priest Each point on the line stands for a particular possible career . Each car on the line is better than every career that lies to its left . A standar configuration consists of a continuous chain like this , together with a single alternative that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard is the career available to you in the army . We hold that constant , while comparing it with all the various careers in the chain . In a standard configuration , the chain must be sufficiently long that the worst options in the chain are worse than the standard and the best options are better than the standard . The choice of careers is only an example . Standard configurations can he drawn up in other contexts too . Suppose you are choosing between dinner and a film . You can hold the film constant as standard , and form an imaginary chain of dinners that varies continuously from grim to superb . In general , then , a chain is like this : Possible options As we move from left to right along a chain , two things are essential for my purposes . First , there is improvement all the way : every option is better than every option to its left . Secondly , the improvement is continuous . Joseph Raz thinks this may not always be possible . ' He suggests some values may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrete steps . Myself , I can think of no values that are discrete like this . But even if there are some , we can still always change the goodness of an option in a continuous fashion , because options need not realize only one value . We can simply add or subtract amounts of some value that is not discrete . For instance , the service at dinner might be quicker or slower ; that is a quality that can certainly vary continuously . I am sure there are at least some continuous values . So I see no difficulty in assuming the chain is continuous . 9.3 Definitions Now we have the standard configuration , let us start to compare the options in the chain with the standard - in the example , the church careers with the army career . At the left of the line there are options that are worse than the standard ; they form the worse zone ' , as I shall call it . At the right are options that are better than the standard ; they form the better zone ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases . There may he more than one option between these zones - between options that are better // han the standard and those that are worse . There may be just one . Or there ay be none . This third case is genuinely possible , but it is not important or this chapter and I shall say no more about it.6 So we have two cases to onsider . In the first , where more than one option lies between the worse zone and the better zone , there must be many that do . If there are two options tween those zones , any option in the chain that lies in between these two ptions must also lie between the zones . So there will be an intermediate one of options between the worse and better zones . The cases we need to onsider , then , are , first , where there is an intermediate zone and , secondly , where there is just a single intermediate option . ' Fake some intermediate option . Suppose it happens to be equally as good as the standard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the line ) would be better than the standard , and any option worse than it ( to its left ) would be worse than the standard . It would therefore be the only intermedi ate option between those that are better than the standard and those that are worse . So if there is more than one intermediate option ? an intermedi ate zone ? no option within this zone can be equally as good as the stan dard . In this argument , I assumed that if one option is better or worse than another , and the other is equally as good as a third , then the first is , respec tively , better or worse than the third . This is part of the meaning of equally as good as ' . ( It is a extension of transitivity . ) It prevents any option in an intermediate zone from being equally as good as the standard . But if there is only a single intermediate option , nothing of this sort pre-vents it from being equally as good as the standard . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good as the standard . The slightest improvement or deterioration in this option would make it better or worse than the stan dard . If a choice is so finely balanced that the slightest change in one of the alternatives can make the difference between its being worse and its being better than the other , surely the alternatives are equally good . Indeed , I think we may define a single intermediate option to be as good as the standard . I propose this as a definition of equally as good as ' : one option A is equally as good as another B if and only if any possible option that is better or worse than A is also , respectively , better or worse than B , and any possible option that is better or worse than B is also , respectively , Netter or worse than A. ( This definition does not state explicitly that A is neither better nor worse than B , because that is implied by the rest . ) This is an acceptable definition because it meets the formal condition that equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it must be an equivalence rela tion it must he transitive , reflexive , and symmetric . The definition has the effect that , when there is just a single intermediate I50 The structure of good option , it must be equally as good as the standard ( except in some peculiar cases ) . The picture is , then : Let us call this the equality case ' . Next , let us define one option A to be incommensurate ' with another B if and only if it is not the case that A is better than B , and not the case that B is better than A , and not the case that A and B are equally good . We have found that , if there is an intermediate zone , all the options in it are incommensurate with the standard . Let us call this the incommensurate case ' . Its picture is : To sum up : we have only one primitive relation to deal with ? better than ' . Equally as good as ' and incommensurate with ' are defined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the structure of the better than ' relation . This relation picks out the zone of options that are better than the standard and the zone of options that are worse than the standard . If it leaves only one option in a chain intermediate between these zones , this option is equally as good as the standard . If it leaves an intermediate zone , the options in this zone are incommensurate with the standard . The difference between equality and incommensurateness is simply whether there is one intermediate option or many . There is no further , intuitive distinction between the two.7 My definition of equally as good as ' may seem unsatisfactory , because it may seem to deny a significant possibility . When there is only a single intermediate option between the worse and better zones , there may seem to be two possibilities for it : it might be equally as good as the standard or it might not be . When I defined it to be equally as good as the standard , I was denying the second possibility . However , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct . I see // no genuine second possibility . What real difference could there be between a case where this intermediate option is equally as good as the standard and a case where it is not ? Presumably , the difference would have to show up in some practical way : it would have to make some difference to your decision making , if you ever had to make a choice between this option and the stan-dard . Now , it certainly makes a practical difference whether there is a single intermediate option or a whole intermediate zone ; I shall explain why in section 9.8 . But when we are anyway dealing with just a single intermedi-ate option , I see no real difference . Various things would be true if you had to make the choice between the intermediate option and the standard : it is not the case that you ought to choose the intermediate option , nor that you ought to choose the standard ; choosing either would not be wrong ; it is not determinate which you ought to choose ; and so on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative is better than the other ; none of them indicates a difference between their being equally good and their not being equally good . I shall say more about this in section 9.7. 9.4 Is there incommensurability ? Having set up the definitions , we can turn to substantive questions . The first question I mentioned at the end of section 9.1 is : are options necessarily ordered by their goodness ? As I have now formalized it , this question has become : does the incommensurate case really exist , or is it only a technical possibility ? Let commensurabilism ' be the view that it does not exist . We can now see that commensurabilism is implausible . It is very stringent because it requires a sharp division between options that are worse than the standard and those that are better . There is at most one intermediate option . But this is implausible in , for instance , the careers example . It is implausible that a tiny change in the conditions of a church career could make all the difference between this career 's being worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have an intermediate zone ; it seems to fit the incommensurate case . At first , one might think commensurabilism could be supported by the epistemicist theory of vagueness . Take a vague predicate such as red ' . Most people believe there are borderline cases between things that are red and things that are not red . Of these borderline cases , we can not say definitely that they are red , nor that they are not red . But epistemicists about vague-ness believe there is a sharp boundary between red and not red , despite appearances . All coloured things are either red or not , and for apparently borderline cases we are simply ignorant which they are . Although epistem-icism is intuitively unattractive , there are arguments in its favour ; epistemi-cists believe their theory is the only way to avoid certain logical problems // that afflict other theories of vagueness.8 So if epistemicism implied commensurabilism , it would give commensurabilism support . But epistemicism does not imply commensurabilism . Consider the predicates better than soldiering ' and worse than soldiering ' . Epistemicism implies that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career of a priest takes us across the borderline from a career that is worse than soldiering to one that is not worse than soldiering , and from one that is not better than soldiering to one that is better than soldiering . In the incommensurate case , epistemicism implies that the borderline between the worse zone and the incommensurate zone is sharp , and so is the borderline between the incommensurate zone and the better zone . But it does not rule out the existence of an incommensurate zone . Only if these borderlines had to coincide would this be ruled out . Epistemicism does not imply that they coincide , so it gives no support to commensurabilism . Given that , I think we may safely reject commensurabilism because of its sheer implausibility . I shall go on to the second of the two questions mentioned at the end of section 9.1 : given that commensurabilism is false , and options are not necessarily ordered by their goodness , what importance does that have for ethics ? I can now express this question more precisely : how ethically significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case ? Sections 9.5 and 6 consider two arguments about this that have to do with the form of the betterness relation . Sections 9.7 to 9.10 consider the importance of the difference for practical decision making . 9.5 Rough equality Griffin does not support commensurabilism as I have defined it . For example , he would accept that there may be a range of careers as a priest that are intermediate between those that are better than soldiering and those that are worse . So he accepts there are incommensurate cases . However , he seems to think they are all , or at least mostly , cases of rough equality ' . We might call Griffin a rough commensurabilist ' . Evidently he thinks the difference between equality and incommensurateness is not very important . What does rough equality ' mean , exactly ? Griffin presents an analysis , 9 but we do not need to analyse the concept very far in order to see that rough commensurabilism is implausible . So long as roughly equal ' has something like its ordinary meaning , this must be true : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third can not differ very much from each other in their goodness . They do not have to be roughly equal in goodness to each other ; that would follow if rough equality was a transitive relation , // but ( as Griffin points out ) it is not . Nevertheless , they plainly can not differ very much in their goodness . Griffin is evidently assuming that no incommensurate zone can be very wide . But there seems to be no reason why it should not be . We would generally expect the zone to be narrow when we are comparing similar types of thing , and wide when we are comparing very different things . Between joining the Northumberland Rifles and the Fifth Lancers , the zone may be narrow , but between the church and the army it may be very wide . A mediocre career in the church may not be definitely worse than a career in the army , and a successful career in the church may not be definitely better than a career in the army . But a successful career in the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that not all careers in the incommensurate zone are roughly equally as good as a career in the army . To make this argument , I have presumed we have some scale of goodness . It need only be a rough scale , just enough to give sense to such expressions as much better ' , do not differ much in their goodness ' , and so on . The idea of rough equality itself presumes a rough scale , so I have taken one for granted in arguing against it . Commensurabilism is very implausible because it presumes there is no intermediate zone at all , but at most one intermediate option . Rough commensurabilism is less implausible , but implausible nonetheless because it presumes the intermediate zone is narrow . If we are to believe it , at least we need from Griffin an argument why this zone should be narrow . 9.6 Vagueness Griffin does make one point that I think is intended as such an argument . He claims that incommensurability is vagueness.i0 When two options are incommensurate , we can not say either is better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's view is that , although we can not assert This one is better ' , we also can not deny it , and although we can not assert That one is better ' , we can not deny that either . Take the career example again . Griffin believes the predicates better than soldiering ' and worse than soldiering ' are vague . Unlike the epistemicists , he believes this means there is no sharp borderline between priest-careers that are better than soldiering and those that are not , nor between priestcareers that are worse than soldiering and those that are not . More than that , he thinks these borderlines overlap and extend across the whole incommensurate zone . The consequence is that , although we can not assert of a career within this zone that it is better than soldiering , we can not deny it either . Also , although we can not assert it is worse than soldiering , we can not deny that either . The incommensurate zone is a zone of vagueness. // Joseph Raz disagrees . He thinks that , of a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than soldiering and deny it is worse than soldiering too.11 The issue between these views is a fiddly question of logic . As it happens , I think Griffin is right and Raz wrong , but since the arguments are fiddly 1 shall not present them here.12 The real difference of opinion between Griffin and Raz is not the fiddly one about logic , but that Raz thinks incommensurability is important , and Griffin thinks it is not . They both seem to take it for granted that , if incommensurability was vagueness , it would not be important . That is why they disagree about whether it is indeed vagueness . But if incommensurability is vagueness , why should that make it unimportant ? Raz says it would merely be an instance of the general indeterminacy of our language.13 That is true ; at least , vagueness is a common feature of our concepts . But why should it make it unimportant ? If better than ' is vague , I see no reason why that should not be a significant feature of ethics . Vagueness in general is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very important feature of several ethical problems . I think Griffin believes that if the incommensurate zone is a zone of vagueness , then it can not be very wide , and that would make it unimportant . It would support his contention that options within the zone are roughly equal to the standard in goodness . But vagueness can be very extensive . The Southern Ocean is a vague expanse of water whose boundaries with other oceans are indeterminate to the extent of a thousand miles or so . So the claim that incommensurability is vagueness does not support the claim that it is rough equality . I think the question of vagueness is a red herring when we are interested in the importance of incommensurability . It does not provide an argument why the incommensurate zone must be narrow , and it does not suggest independently that incommensurability must be unimportant . The real question about importance is whether incommensurability makes an important difference to practical decision making . In the next section I shall turn away from the formal questions of vagueness and rough equality to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall assume that incommensurate zones exist , and that they need not be small . We have found no reason for doubting either of these assumptions . 9.7 Practical decision making What implications does incommensurability have for how we ought to act ? What ought we to do when faced with a choice between two options that are incommensurate in their goodness ? To smooth the way for answering this question , let us make the assumption that the goodness of ' the options // is the only consideration relevant to the choice . This is to assume teleology ; teleology is the view that how one ought to act is determined by the goodness of the available options . Nonteleological theories deny this . For instance , some nonteleological theories hold there are rules of right action deontic rules ? that are not determined entirely by the goodness of the options . To get a clear view of the importance of incommensurability , let us set nonteleological theories aside . Granted teleology , when you are faced with a choice between two options , if one is better than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be wrong to choose the other . But if the two options are either incommensurate or equally good , what then ? We can not say that you ought to choose one , nor that you ought to choose the other . Choosing either would not b wrong . It is not determinate which you ought to choose . Reason , as it were , leaves you on your own . You must simply decide without the guidance of reason . This is mysterious in one way . Rational creatures have to be able to decide without the guidance of reason , and it is mysterious how we can do that . Buridan 's Ass could not manage it ; how can we ? It is not simply a matter of choosing which we like , since we may not like either of the options any more than the other . So how do we choose ? One might be tempted to use this mystery as an argument against incommensurability . One might argue that reason simply can not leave us in the lurch like this ; there must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a valid argument , it would work just as effectively against equality of goodness as against incommensurability . Since equality of goodness is surely possible , the argument must fail . It leaves us with the mystery of how we choose . But I have no need to solve this mystery , because it applies equally to the incommensurate case and the equality case ; it does not distinguish them . If you are faced with a choice between two options , and they are equally good , it does not matter which you choose . If they are incommensurate , it does matter . People often identify this as the practical importance of the distinction : one type of choice matters and the other does not . But actually this remark is a mere tautology . To say a choice between two options does not matter ? literally , and not simply that it does not matter much ? is simply to say the options are equally good , and to say it does matter is simply to say they are not equally good . I conclude that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is nothing in practical decision making that is different between the incommensurate case and the equality case . To find a difference we need to look further . In section 9.3 , I distinguished the cases by means of a structural feature of betterness that does not show up in an isolated choice like this . Using the device of the standard configuration , I made the // distinction depend on whether there is an intermediate zone or a single intermediate option , between options that are better than the standard and those that are worse , or just one . So this structural feature is where we should look for a practical difference between the cases . The difference must depend on there being an intermediate zone rather than a single intermediate option . 9.8 A puzzle Here indeed there is a significant difference . Decision making in the incommensurate case , but not the equality case , can lead to a puzzle . Suppose two careers are open to you : a career in the army and a good career as a priest . Suppose they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wrong . You have to choose without the guidance of reason , and suppose you choose the army : you commit yourself to the army career , and give up the chance of a good career in the church . In doing so you are doing nothing wrong . But then suppose another opportunity comes up to join the church , this time in much worse conditions . You now face a choice between the army or a much less good career as a priest . Suppose these two , also , are incommensurate . Choosing either would not be wrong . You have to choose without the guidance of reason . Suppose this time you choose the church . Once again you do nothing wrong . But though you have not acted wrongly in either of your choices , the effect of the two together is that you end up with a much worse career in the church than you could have had . Surely rationality should be able to protect you from this sort of bad result ; surely there is something irrational in what you have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is puzzling . ' ' No such bad result could have emerged had you only been choosing amongst options that are equally good . Suppose you have a choice between A and B , and the two are equally good . Suppose you choose B. Next suppose you have a choice between B and C , which are also equally good , and you choose C. Neither of your choices is contrary to reason . But in this case you are no worse off with C than you would have been with A. A and C must be equally good because the relation equally as good as ' is transitive . On the other hand , the relation incommensurate with ' is not . So we have identified a practical difficulty that arises in the incommensurate case but not in the equality case . This certainly makes the difference significant . The puzzle is that rational decision making leaves you worse off than you could have been . But what is puzzling about that ? The same thing can happen in ways that are not puzzling at all . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected to lead to a good result , but by sheer bad luck it might lead to a bad result . The example I described can // also be interpreted in a way that is not puzzling . You might just change your mind between one decision and the next . Having chosen the army , you might decide that was a mistake , and make the best of a bad job by taking up the only church career that is still available . Then you would not have acted irrationally . Nor is it puzzling that you end up worse off than you could have been . The puzzle arises only if , when you make the second choice of a poor church career rather than the army , you do not at the same time repudiate your first choice of the army rather than a good church career . If at one single time you are willing to endorse both decisions , then you are certainly in a puzzling condition . 9.9 Bayesianism Compare a similar puzzle that arises in a different context . Suppose you are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have no information whatsoever about which is likely to win ; indeed you do not even know the number of entries in the race . You find the bookies offering even odds on Gorgeous to win . Having no reason not to , you place a ? 10 bet on Gorgeous . In that , you are doing nothing wrong . Next you find even odds are also offered on Screaming Angel to win , and , having no reason not to do this either , you place a ? 10 bet on it . Again , you are doing nothing wrong . Finally , you find even odds offered on Intravenous to win , and you place a ? 10 bet on Intravenous too , once more doing nothing wrong . By these three bets , you have guaranteed yourself a loss of at least ? 10 . You have accepted what is known as a Dutch book ' against yourself . This is puzzling , since you have done nothing wrong . ( Let us abstract from the fun of the game and assume your only object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ways this can happen that are not at all puzzling . For instance , you might change your mind about the horses ' chances as the afternoon progresses . Having bet on one horse , you might decide another is more likely to win and bet on that one , resigning yourself to losing on the first , and hoping to recoup some of your losses . But you are in a puzzling condition if you are willing to endorse your bets on the three horses at the same time . Here is a Bayesian solution to the puzzle . Your bets are in fact irrational . True , none is individually irrational , because you have no reason not to bet on each of the horses individually . But each bet you place on a horse implies you have a particular degree of belief in that horse 's winning . When you bet on Gorgeous at even odds , that implies you believe to some degree at least as much as a half that it will win . You have no reason either to have this belief or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the bet or not to // make it . But you should only make it if in fact you do have this degree of belief in the horse 's winning . Similarly , you should bet on Screaming Angel only if you believe to a degree at least as much as a half that Screaming Angel will win , and you should bet on Intravenous only if you believe to a degree at least as much as a half that Intravenous will win . Now , it is irrational to believe to a degree at least as much as a half that Gorgeous will win , and to a degree at least as much as a half that Screaming Angel will win , and to a degree at least as much as a half that Intravenous will win . So your three bets together are irrational . Let me put this Bayesian argument in better order . Bayesians think , first , that reason imposes particular constraints on the combinations of bets you should make . These are constraints of consistency , and they are laid down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axioms are that , if you do not stick to them , you will be vulnerable to traps such as Dutch books . Bayesians next claim that bets imply particular degrees of belief . For instance , betting on a horse at particular odds implies a particular degree of belief in its winning . They then demonstrate mathematically that , if your betting is consistent according to the axioms , it implies a consistent pattern of beliefs . Otherwise it implies an inconsistent pattern . Consistent ' here means conforming to laws of probability . For instance , your degrees of belief in various horses winning a race must not add up to more than one . This consistency of belief gives further support to the consistency requirements of the axioms : bets that are consistent according to the axioms can be interpreted in terms of consistent beliefs . The upshot is that , if you are to be rational , you must act according to some probability beliefs or other . This is so whether or not there are rational grounds for some beliefs rather than others . If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horses ? you should still have beliefs . As it is often put , you should have subjective probabilities and act on them . This is so even if there are no objective probabilities , so reason does not determine which subjective probabilities you should have . Reason still determines that you should have some . 9.10 Reasons and intentions We might take a similar Bayesian line about the career example . Neither of your decisions ? to join the army rather than to take up a good career as a priest , and to take up the less good career as a priest rather than join the army ? is irrational on its own , but they are irrational in combination . Your decisions should be consistent with each other in particular ways , because otherwise you may find yourself in traps such as the one that actually // caught you . Just as Bayesians interpret betting decisions as implying beliefs , we can interpret your decisions as implying values . Your first choice in the example implies that you value a career in the army at least as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , your second choice implies that you value a less good career in the church at least as highly as a career in the army . So these two decisions imply inconsistent values . Consistent decisions will imply a consistent value system . In this case , the objective facts of goodness do not determine what values you ought to adopt . They do not determine whether you should value an army career higher than a good church career , or a less good church career higher than an army career . So reason does not determine what your subjective values should be . But it does determine that you should have some and act according to them . This Bayesian line is commensurabilist in a sense . Values may be objectively incommensurable , but subjectively they should not be . Objective values may leave room for subjective choices , but to act consistently you need to settle on subjective values for yourself , and these must have no incommensurability . Moreover , this is a sort of commensurabilism that many people might find credible even if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implausible . They might think objective commensurabilism is implausible , but the need for consistency in decisions gives grounds for subjective commensurabilism . Whatever the objective facts , we need to create fully commensurable value-systems for ourselves . This conclusion would have made a pleasant ending for a chapter in honour of James Griffin . However , I am sorry to say I shall have to end with doubts about it . There is a good objection to the Bayesian line . When you make your decisions in the career example , there is no reason to think you are reflecting your values . You have to decide between one career and another . If there are no grounds for your decision , you have to make it all the same , without grounds . Consequently , the fact that you make it does not show you have grounds.16 In particular , your decision need not imply a subjective system of values that gives it grounds . The same objection may be raised against the Bayesian line on probability . You have to choose whether or not to bet on Gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of winning , you have no grounds on which to base this decision . You have to decide , so you decide without grounds . The fact that you decide to bet does not show you have grounds for doing so . In particular , it does not show you believe to a degree greater than a half that Gorgeous will win . Bayesians might not be troubled by this objection . To avoid a Dutch hook , you must certainly act as if you have a consistent pattern of beliefs . Whether you actually have one or not might not particularly concern a Bayesian . IIthe Bayesian favours a behaviourist or functionalist notion of
