Talk about mixed emotions . What do you do when someone asks you about your favorite secret-stash ski area ? Do you rave about the great snow , short lift lines , and reasonable prices ? Or do you keep quiet , knowing that if the word gets out , the crowds will roll in ? It 's a tough call , especially if the area is an up-and-coming resort perched on the brink of the big time . Just because an area is little-known does n't mean it 's small-time . Having sprouted new lifts and lodges , it can offer many of the comforts and conveniences of the better-known resorts . Take Schweitzer Mountain Resort , which joined the up-and-comers club in 1990 . A pristine powder stash in the Selkirks of northern Idaho , Schweitzer has been satisfying the locals for 30 years . The terrain consists of a pair of back-to-back bowls that provide a medley of steep chutes , powder glades , and gentle trails through thick timber . The snow , up to 300 inches a year , falls light , deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than the exception . And yet , it 's virtually unknown outside the Northwest . That began to change three years ago when the area set its sights on an ambitious 10-year expansion plan . Starting with a high-speed quad and a stylish , slopeside hotel  --  the Green Gables Lodge  --  the area began offering the upscale amenities it previously lacked . Car-free convenience , fine dining , excellent day care  --  all the things that make a destination resort a destination worth heading for . Overnight , it seemed , Schweitzer went from humble homebody to skiing Cinderella . The skiing public , however , has been slow to catch on , which is just fine with the few who have . They like the fact that you can still get a room at the Green Gables Lodge without reserving it a year in advance . They like the fact that the nearby town of Sandpoint is picturesque , but not pretentious  --  a place where visitors are treated as guests , not just tourists with deep pockets . And they like the fact that , although Schweitzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status-seekers . Other ski areas are not so much up-and-coming as up-and-coming-back . Twenty-five years ago , areas like Sugarbush and Mont Tremblant were already among skiing 's elite resorts , places where celebrities and style-meisters set the tenor of the times . Unfortunately , times changed , and when these areas did n't , they fell out of favor , eventually getting dowdy and rundown . Now , after years of neglect , they 're recapturing their former glory with new facilities and a commitment to customer service . If Schweitzer 's a Cinderella story , these born-again resorts recall Sleeping Beauty . Whatever their tale , most up-and-comers share several traits . They are , for the most part , family-friendly , offering package deals and a relaxed atmosphere that fosters freedom for both parents and children . Likewise , they 're often more affordable than A-list areas ; many are just breaking the $30-a-day mark , while big-time resorts are topping $40 ( Schweitzer 's full-day adult ticket costs only $32 ) . And because they ca n't compete with the big boys on quantity  --  be it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they 're forced to compete on the quality of their service . Even regular folks get the star treatment . But to my mind , the best thing about up-and-coming resorts is what I call the lag factor . In order to draw new skiers ( or to get old ones back ) , an up-and-comer is forced to build for crowds that do n't yet exist . For a certain period  --  it could be one year , it could be five  --  it 's woefully overbuilt , which often translates into pleasantly undercrowded . Standing alone at the top of an untouched run on a bright , winter morning , you ca n't help but feel as if you 're the first person to discover the place . Like the guy I ran into at Schweitzer last year . He was from California , I think , or Colorado , and he and his family were checking out as I was checking in . " How 's the skiing ? " I asked in passing . " Incredible , " he said . " We 've been here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves . Our one-year-old loved the day care ; the older kids were hooked on ski school ; and my wife and I could keep tabs on all of them and still have time to ourselves . And there were no lift lines  --  I skied powder every day . How come nobody knows about this place ? " Like I said , mixed emotions . <p>
