<p> When the Progress &; Freedom Foundation was established in April 1993 , it described its purpose as the " nonpartisan analysis , study and research " of broad cultural trends in " American civilization . " <p> In fact , the main purpose of the nonprofit think tank has been the promotion of one man 's vision : that of Rep. Newt Gingrich . The foundation is the newest addition to " Newt Inc. , " a network of political and philosophical vehicles that Gingrich has used over the last decade to advance himself and his ideas . He has tapped many of the same contributors to fund his various megaphones , which range from a book containing his world view to a college course he teaches on American culture . <p> What Gingrich has done , to a degree matched by few politicians , is to use tax-exempt organizations and tax-deductible contributions to disseminate his philosophy . His approach is controversial because IRS rules prohibit the use of tax-deductible funds for partisan purposes , and the line between Gingrich 's philosophy and his political goals is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Progress &; Freedom Foundation , is Gingrich 's exact role . The lawmaker has no official position in the organization . Its 50-page filing with the Internal Revenue Service for tax-exempt status mentions him only once , and says the foundation will function in an " independent and objective " manner . <p> Yet Gingrich is central to its activities . More than half of the foundation 's $ 1.2 million budget in its first year went to pay for a college course taught by Gingrich , entitled " Renewing American Civilization " and a weekly talk show called " The Progress Report , " which the congressman hosts on the conservative cable network National Empowerment Television , financial records show . <p> Both the course and the show feature the voluble lawmaker extolling ideas that have been central to his brand of futuristic conservatism , such as eliminating the welfare state , shrinking the overall role of government and elevating technological development to a kind of secular religion that will eventually enable man to colonize space . <p> Principals Are Political Allies <p> Most of the foundation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed to his campaigns or to projects that he has utilized to trumpet his ideas . The foundation 's president is Jeffrey A. Eisenach , Gingrich 's self-described " intellectual sidekick " and former executive director of GOPAC , the conservative political organization headed by Gingrich that focuses on training candidates . <p> Senior fellow Heather Richardson-Higgins directs the Randolph Foundation , which has been a contributor to GOPAC and gave a $ 50,000 grant to the college course , according to records . Richardson is also Gingrich 's co-host on " The Progress Report . " Like some other board members , Daryl Conner is a friend as well as a political ally : He was a financial backer of Gingrich 's 1984 book and in the early 1980s , employed the congressman 's wife , Marianne , as a freelance marketing consultant for several months at his Atlanta management consulting business . <p> No one would discern the ties between the organization and Gingrich from the foundation 's IRS filing . It describes the college course in detail , but does not mention that Gingrich would teach it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gingrich would host it . The only mention of Gingrich is at the very bottom of a list of 10 authors whose papers are to serve as the course 's main reading . <p> Foundation board members said its decisions are made independently of Gingrich and stress that the organization sponsors other projects that do not involve the congressman , including studies on medical and telecommunications deregulation and research for a book by one of the group 's senior fellows . <p> The board members said that Eisenach is the foundation 's driving force and that they and Gingrich merely share many social and political views . <p> " There were two possible models for the foundation , " Eisenach said in a recent interview . " One , what was good for Newt Gingrich and two , what promotes ideas that Newt Gingrich mostly shares and may , as a byproduct , be helpful to him in getting ideas out ? " <p> Eisenach added : " What I 'm trying to do is develop an intellectual underpinning for the next generation of conservatives ... . How do I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of selling ideas for which Newt Gingrich is the most effective spokesman ; the ideas are bigger than any one person . " <p> In the words of Frank Hanna , a foundation board member and contributor to some Gingrich projects , " This is a team of like-minded people and Newt Gingrich is our Michael Jordan ; he is a star . " <p> Frank Gregorsky , a foundation co-incorporator and senior fellow who was Gingrich 's chief of staff from 1981 to 1983 , said that he and Eisenach have talked about possibly recruiting an elected Democrat whose views are compatible with the foundation 's visions , to " balance Newt ... and give us more partisan diversity . " <p> Eisenach said he alone decided to start the foundation , although Gingrich and others discussed with him the need to create a vision of the American future . <p> The foundation was formed after Republicans gained only 10 seats in the House in the 1992 congressional races despite a big GOP push that was backed by a GOPAC plan , which included a new Gingrich video entitled " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994 , the organization raised $ 658,496 , mostly from other foundations . In its current fiscal year , the group projects it will raise $ 2.25 million . <p> Borrowing From the Left <p> In an interview last week , Gingrich said that by setting up entities like the foundation , conservatives are doing nothing different than their liberal counterparts . <p> " Somebody wants to set up a legitimate foundation to deal with ideas . The foundation does legitimate work about ideas . What 's the beef ? " Gingrich said of the Progress &; Freedom Foundation . " I mean everything everybody has reported about anything I work with , we model this on how the left , how the modern left organizes power . " <p> Still , Gingrich 's use of nonpartisan organizations and his financing of other projects has prompted several inquiries during the 51-year-old lawmaker 's career . Currently , the House ethics committee is studying a complaint filed by Ben Jones , Gingrich 's opponent in the November election , alleging that the congressman violated House rules by improperly using GOPAC , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college course before the Progress &; Freedom Foundation took it over . <p> Contributors got tax deductions because the college 's foundation , which is prohibited from engaging in partisan activities , collected the money . Gingrich has challenged the ethics committee 's authority , saying that Jones 's charges center on a tax matter that falls under IRS jurisdiction . <p> Marcus Owens , director of the IRS 's exempt organizations division , said , " Certainly the involvement of an elected official would cause the IRS to look closely " at a foundation to ensure it was n't aiding his campaign or substantially benefiting him . But he added , " A politician or anyone else has a right to promote controversial ideas . The key is keeping the organization separate from one 's campaign . " <p> The Federal Election Commission is suing GOPAC , saying that the organization tried to solicit funds for federal candidates in 1989 and therefore must publicly disclose its contributors  --  as required by law . GOPAC has now decided to disclose the names of future contributors . <p> In 1989 , House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 21 supporters to promote Gingrich 's 1984 book " Window of Opportunity . " Because the book lost money , the partners could use their investments as tax write-offs . The ethics committee concluded about a year later that there was no basis for starting disciplinary proceedings against Gingrich . <p> Staff researcher Barbara J. Saffir contributed to this report . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : January 8 , 1995 <p> CORRECTION : The Randolph Foundation has not been a contributor to GOPAC , a conservative political organization . A Dec. 21 article misstated the relationship between the two .
