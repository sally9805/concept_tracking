TOKYO : In a shocking departure from Japan 's usual civility , ethnic-Korean schoolchildren are being victimized by racist assaults and taunts , apparently in reprisal for North Korea 's intransigence over nuclear inspections . Last Monday evening , a 17-year-old female student at a Tokyo high school run by Chongryun , a North Korean residents ' association , was riding home when a young man tried to push her off her bicycle . The assailant then slashed her school uniform with a pair of scissors . That assault was one of more than 120 verbal or physical attacks reported in Japan by Chongryun since April . Though Japanese police put the total much lower , the issue has alarmed Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata , who condemned the incidents as " intolerable . " Said a 78-year- old Korean woman who has lived in Japan for more than 70 years : " These attacks are crazy . Those children have committed no crimes . If the Japanese people want to protest against the North Korean regime , they should do so openly . " Most Japanese are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mother : " I wonder why such an ordinary young man did such a nasty thing to an innocent girl . " <P> SYDNEY : Jubilant in September when Sydney beat out Beijing for the 2000 Olympics , Australians are still looking for an organizer to mount the spectacle . As of last week , two handpicked candidates had turned down the top job , both saying their existing employers offered generous pay raises to keep them . Many critics feel the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games flubbed by offering bronze-medal remuneration  --  $292,000 a year  --  for a gold-medal job . Others are aghast that the honor of the position is apparently not incentive enough . Said salesman Charlie Perkiss : " They must start looking for someone who believes in the Olympic spirit . " <P> HYERES : The investigation into the February murder of French legislator and anticrime crusader Yann Piat near this southern city took a new twist last week . Shortly after her murder by two motorcycle-riding gunmen , police had collared two thugs who worked as musclemen for Piat 's political rivals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charges of corruption against several officials . Last week police dropped murder charges against the original suspects and arrested Lucien Ferri , 22 , who has confessed to firing the fatal shots , and Marco Di Caro , 21 , who admitted driving the motorcycle . This opens a fresh investigation into the presumption that the masterminds of the slaying were not Piat 's political opponents but drug dealers linked to the local Mafia . " If the police keep digging with what they 've got , " said a Hyeres cafe owner , " we wo n't be finished with this for years ! "
