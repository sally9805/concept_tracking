When I decided to ask Recita Holguin to marry me , I visited my confessor , The Bishop , in his place of banishment . He is not a bishop now , but he was once . <p> " Red ! " he said . " Red ! " And he hugged me close , his cheek and ear pressed hard against my chest . He stepped back , and raised up on his toes , and held his arms over my shoulders to bless me : " Fountain of Heaven . Mother of God . Ark of Peace . " This old blessing of strange and disturbing power brought tears to us both . His bony chest contracted against me . My nose ran . I had no handkerchief and had to use my hand . I snicked the stickiness from one side of my nose , then the other , onto the La Florida Deluxe Motel parking lot . <p> " God bless you , " he said as if I had sneezed . His one-room apartment had a hide-a-bed sofa , long , wide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the place to sit . " I said , " Nice , " rested my butt and hands on the dull green and vermilion mysteries in the fabric . <p> The band of freckles across his dark nose and cheeks made his face a galaxy of amazement , made his large eyes seem larger , and his wide forehead wider . No end to the horizons of his joy . I had admired these freckles when we met for the first time as children in 1915 ; I had seen them for eighty-one years of friendship . When he sat down near me , he said , " I have planned ! I have imagined your visit , Red . You are a dream ! " <p> He rested his hands inside mine . Yes , I held them . Holding them gave me such pleasure I should be ashamed to confess it . But I am less afraid than I once was of allowing that there is a kind of touching friends do that should be called lovemaking . <p> How dear The Bishop 's hands were to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now covered with freckles . I said , " What are these ? " <p> " Nasturtiums , " he said , thinking I had asked about the overlapping vermilion and green faces in his sofa . Perennially , flowers blossomed in his thoughts . I asked again : " These ? " His fingers were freckled , and his palms . " They 're everywhere ! " <p> His wrists and arms were freckled . His neck . He bowed his head to show me his freckled scalp . He said , " God is Lord of Tattooists , no ? " <p> I strained not to imagine the number of freckles . But I am a counter , I do n't know why . All my life I have felt the need . I counted rocks in the rock walls my father built for a living ; the number of people who received communion at Sunday Mass ; the hats on the heads in Albertson 's supermarket ; the trees in the Christmas tree lots . I counted money in my dreams before I ever stole it , counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planned amount ) , counted it after I stole it . Money , trees , hats , holy people , rocks . Whatever was beautiful to me I wanted to know the amount of its beauty . The Bishop 's freckles . Numberless . <p> " I have a fire over me " The Bishop said . They did look like tiny rising or collapsing flames . " What dark angels hover over you , Red ? " <p> " My problems are nothing ; ' I said . " My sins are crumbs , " <p> " Impossible ! " he said . " Your sins have always been loaves ! I have feasted on your sins , Red ! Have you stolen nothing lately ? " <p> I wanted to please him . How could I not want that ? I said , " I have kept secrets . From Recita . ' <p> " You have . You have ? Of course you have ! " He tugged at my hands to lift me from the sofa . " Do n't start your confession yet . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything is already prepared . " <p> He sliced hard-boiled eggs with the egg slicer I had given him . He served full glasses of wine , one of the twelve bottles I had lifted for him from the cellar of my friend Eusebio . The cottage cheese was small curd . We sprinkled red chili powder over the egg slices ( ten for me , twelve for him ) and into the cheese . <p> I said , " I will be direct . I 'm going to ask Recita to marry me . " <p> " Wonderful , " he said . <p> " Wonderful , " I said . " It is . Wonderful . But I worry . " The golden yoke on my tongue crumbled . I did n't know what to say next . <p> " Tell what you can , Red . " <p> " After so many years . There are questions . " " On earth as in heaven , Red . " He coughed . " What is the big question-la pregunta grande ? " <p> " Impotency , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Dios ! " He coughed hard . He wiped bits of shiny egg from his lips . " I think-I think we should finish our meal , " he said . <p> " I do n't know . I might be unready . Alone twenty-three years . " <p> The chili powder , too much chili powder , made him gasp . He said , " You are old , my friend . But she is also . " He sprinkled more powder on his egg slice , both sides . " The dust settles . It can be kicked up again . " His lips were red as a harlot 's . <p> " Sins are involved , " I said . " Impure thoughts . Things I have not told her . " " Oh . Oh ! " What food before him could satisfy him like this news ? He said , " The coffee is already made . Fresh-ground . Smell it ? " He wiped his hands with his napkin , but not his mouth . " So . We will go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him about La Memoria . <p> You have heard of the tradition of setting the table for a dead loved one ? People will do this in order to pretend . They will invite The Memory back . They will put the chair and setting where La Memoria sits . They will serve the soup and bread that are La Memoria 's favorites . How many ice cubes does La Memoria like in the glass ? What brand of creamed corn gave so much simple pleasure ? This is how the ritual of the meal with the dead goes . For a while after the person first dies we set a place for and serve a meal to La Memoria . We invite others among the living to come . Then , we do this on the family birthdays , the name-saint day , the anniversary of marriage , the holidays , the anniversary of death . We invite others among the dead to come . The ritual is crowded with memories . The table is laden with good food . It gets expensive . Eventually , we invite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . Once a year maybe . <p> We pretend . We imagine the departed one , La Memoria , is clever at the table , clever and kind , and a generous listener and always interested and utterly infatuated and in love with us and transformed by our love , the ways that , truly , the departed one was . Except better . We pretend everything was better . <p> Or we imagine the departed one swilling food and drinking like a sow , grunting and cruelly ignoring our cleverness , our kindness and generosity , our perfect love . La Memoria makes us do the dishes , clean the table , sweep the floors . La Memoria leaves us to go watch the television . Good riddance to this memory . " Praise God , " we say until the next meal for the dead . <p> When my wife , Cecilia , died in 1972 , I honored her . La Memoria . Alone in our bedroom , I made our bed , small , queen-size , caved-in bed , as she liked it . I washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I ironed it , and said , " Cecilia . How much ? " I sprayed as much starch as she liked , and I ironed out every wrinkle . I put on the beaten bed pad she had always said was good enough , and I heard my dead wife , La Memoria , say that it was , it was " Good enough , dear Red , " <p> With my hands and with the insides of my arms , I made the white sheets smooth . I put on Cecilia 's quilt , the prized quilt . Her mother had bought it for her in Tijuana from someone who said it was an American Civil War quilt traded across the border and traded back , and worth fortunes . Across her quilt flew lariats of morning glory vines , and inside the lariats flew stars the same pale blue color as the flowers . When everything was made right , I closed the curtains of our room . <p> Well . You can imagine . A man alone . I pretended . And each time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and La Memoria 's lover , Red Greet , became a lover 's dream . <p> I lay longer with La Memoria . I lay every afternoon , in the late afternoons , with La Memoria . Already , I was in love with Recita Holguin-in celibate but passionate love . I should have separated from my dead wife . Death should have helped me . But La Memoria and I would not give up this time together , which was like no time we had ever known in the living years . <p> One day , I stripped off the quilt . I piled all our old wraps and cloaks and coats and jackets on top of the bed . We seemed to be hosting a party , La Memoria and I. So many people had come , the dead and living , and I imagined them as gracious guests , excited by each other 's company , sharing the dip and heaven and earth 's gossip , pouring each other wine from bottles that never emptied , linking arms and hands and spilling everywhere , singing badly and angelically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Memoria and I had crawled naked under the coverings our guests had shed in our bedroom . I had caressed her cool , bare head , that is how we began . We did not rest , not one part of our bodies rested . Even if I wished her to , La Memoria would not rest . We heard the banging of our guests at the bedroom door , and we could not stop , not pause . We heard the joking pleas for us to stop making love long enough to let them take what they needed and leave , and we would not . <p> Through the door , one guest said , " Cecilia , you should be ashamed of yourself . You are dead ! " <p> La Memoria groaned , " How can I be sure ? " <p> Another guest said , " Red ! This is sad . This is not good . " <p> " How can I be sure ? " I said . <p> Our guests said goodbye from behind the door , and we said goodbye back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodbye ! Blessings ! Goodbye ! " and said it to each other , and we closed the spaces between us . Tightly . And La Memoria and I remembered she was dead , but the sadness sharpened our pleasure . In my bliss , I flung off the wraps and jackets , coats and cloaks . The last of our guests left . ( " It is not sad , " the guest whispered through the door . " It is beautiful . " Her voice was Sister Josefa 's . Ex-Carmelite . ) <p> The front door closed with a sound like a last breath . I flung off more coverings . The bed was bare . I was alone . I moved my hands and the insides of my arms over the bed and could barely believe La Memoria had gone . <p> What more do I need to confess ? <p> I still make the bed so many ways . Year after year . I hardly recognize the bed . And who is this La Memoria who visits ? A thousand different Cecilias , and none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every afternoon for twenty-three years has been pretending ? How will I ask Recita , dear Recita , a living woman , to lie with me ? I will disappoint her . I will disappoint me . <p> " Complicated , " The Bishop said . " Weird . And complicated . And familiar . " He leaned toward me on the confessional sofa . His freckles were tiny tilmas . " I am celibate . I know this story . If this is a confession , I do not know absolution that will fit " " Huh ? " I said . <p> He said , " I have old beer in my refrigerator . Bring it . " <p> " No absolution ? " I said . I went to the refrigerator . <p> Dos Equis . Four of them . I put them on the counter and wrestled with the tops . " They 're not screwtops ; ' I said . " Do you have an opener ? " <p> " Bring them , Red . " <p> He unscrewed them , of course . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the bottle across the fabric of the sofa . <p> He swigged . " You need a plan , " he said . <p> " Right ! " I said . " That 's what I need . " <p> The Bishop had no plan . " You must pray for a plan , " he said . <p> " Damn ! " I said . " You have to do better than that . " <p> He swished beer in his mouth . The freckles over his skin were filled with dark red roses no larger than motes . " It is what I do , " he said . " I pray to the saints and holy martyrs for a plan . " <p> I asked , " Which ones do you pray to ? " <p> " The women . Saint Joan . Teresa of Avila . Saint Bridget , Saint Monica . " <p> " The real lookers , " I said . <p> He hummed . His hum meant yes . <p> " And ? And you have a plan ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sixty years ! Sixty years of praying , and you have no plan ! " I stood up . " This is not encouraging , " I said . <p> What could he say ? He said nothing . Finally , he asked me to sit back down . " I love you , Red , " he said . " You know this ? " <p> " I know , " I said . <p> " You love me ? " <p> " I love you . " <p> " Red ! That is a miracle , is it not ? A miracle ! " <p> We had some flan . The lan and the beer did not go good together , but it inspired him . The nutmeg on the flan upset his stomach , and the indigestion inspired him . " Here is my advice , " he said . " Do not pray alone . When you are with Recita and La Memoria , when the three of you are together , pray then . " <p> In Christ Is King Church , at the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Recita Holguin . We were standing close , too close , singing . I made sure she heard . Into her good ear I whispered , " Marry me . " This was during the processional song so that she would have the liturgy , Eucharist , and final blessing to consider . <p> When we left the church , wind freed wisps of Recita 's black , red , and silver hair around her dark face . She lifted her head and neck to let wind expose her however it wished . The blue-brown slackness under her eyes was dear to me . And the sharp brightness at her cheeks where the bones grew dull beneath the skin . Her jaw and chin looked small when she gritted her teeth , closed her mouth in a tight smile that showed fear but no shame . <p> My nose watered . I had to wipe it and my eyes , too . I am a broken , leaking donkey . She saw this , and lent me a Kleenex from her purse , white alligator-skin vinyl . She handed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had she done this , though my nose always watered in the cold and watered when I ate and watered when I laughed good , and so I had often asked her for Kleenexes . <p> She had decided to marry me . <p> I knew for sure because she let me hold her hand on the steps of the church . At the bottom steps she closed her long , wrinkled fingers over mine and pressed our bony fingers , five flinty petals holding up another five , to her breast . She held that flower of old bones to her breast , and bowed her head and smelled the flower . Or it seemed like she smelled it , the way she drew in her breath , so far inside . <p> In my other hand I held her purse , small , almost empty . Through the vinyl skin I felt coins , two lipsticks , no , three , and a balled-up scarf and a fork and knife , a spoon . Soup spoon . <p> This was March 31 , 1995 , the feast of Eucharist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late March to our valley , a murdering frost . It is carried in the winds that have been waiting in the Sierra de la Soledad , waiting until they can come down to claim all the green , hopeful souls of plum and peach and apple trees . <p> " What do you plan for us ? " Recita asked . <p> " Plan ? " I said . I wondered if she had made her own visit to The Bishop 's motel room . " I am eighty-six You are eighty-five . " <p> " You have no plan ? " She , of course , did . Instantly , I saw she did , that during the Mass she had made A Plan . <p> Our hands fell apart . We walked beside each other . No words . Had she said yes to my marriage proposal ? Now I was not sure . Would she tell me her plan ? Was part of her plan to keep The Plan secret ? Already , maybe we were following Her Plan . <p> An Old Woman with a Plan-nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert had met An Old Woman with a Plan and Two Lipsticks and a Soup Spoon instead of meeting only Satan , His suffering , death , and resurrection , all of it , would have begun that very moment-no apostles , no Judas , no high priests , no soldiers , no Barrabas , no Pilate , no heaven-bound thief on His right side , no hellbound thief on His left . And no words . None . On the corner of Mr. Telles 's front yard , we passed a shivering old Santa Rosa plum tree , all its fruit doomed . I thought of La Memoria . How strange I must have looked : Recita on one arm , La Memoria on the other . <p> Finally , I asked , " You have a plan ? " For the first time , I realized we were not walking to her apartment on Espina and Boutz , where I would usually be allowed one kiss , one embrace , a long one sometimes , but only one . I asked , " Where are we going ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was following . <p> " Where ? " I asked . <p> She did not answer . We walked , Recita and I. And La Memoria . Recita 's old legs were tough as the roots of sarsaparilla , and lovely all the way up . I could imagine . I did imagine . Too much I imagined . Inviting legs , but no words . I am a dishonest man , everyone knows this about me . But I am a little honest whenever I tell a story , and I do not put words where there are no words . <p> We came to The Bishop 's house , which had once been my friend Francisco Velasco 's house when he was still bishop . She said , " We will go into his garden . He has a greeeen house . " She did not say " greenhouse , " she said , " greeeen house ; ' a very sly way she said this , a sixteen-year-old girl 's smile on her face . We opened the gate at the back of The Bishop 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it closed behind us , do you see ? Her Plan . <p> It was true . The small house was greeeen . I had sometimes been the caretaker for it , but , I admit , I had ignored it . The door was a brighter yellow-green , the doorknob was emerald-green glass . Its good coldness made my hand ache , my palm burn . I said , " Does n't open . " <p> " No ? " She opened it without a sound . This made her giggle . <p> " Like I dreamed , " she said . She had a dime-size coffee-spill birthmark on her thick , wide nose , right in the center . It had fingerprint whorls in it . I liked this mark , an uneven oval , which she said was twin to such a mark on her mother and all her mother 's ancestors . <p> Moonlight splashed silver upon the windows that had been painted green . On the wooden floor everywhere were shriveled , sharp-smelling bulbs we scooted our feet through . " Irises , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their speckled Formica had been washed clean , so clean the blackgreen light on them was like one current of river flowing over another darker current . <p> " Tell me , " she whispered . She was behind me , close enough I could feel her long dress sweep the back of my ankles . Her nose brushed against my ear , and she kissed the tender place behind it and then before it , and whispered , " Tell me , " and she kissed the place beneath my ear , old , wrinkled , smelly , hairy ear . Ear of a donkey . I was supposed to tell her . Tell her what ? Tell her My Plan , which I did n't have ? <p> " Are you there ? " I asked . You can see , I was asking La Memoria , who was once Cecilia herself , if she was still there with us . I did n't feel her at my side . <p> Recita said , " She is gone . " <p> " She is , is n't she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's purse on the floor , the things inside it clinked . She turned me around to face her , and in the turning , she slipped off her shoes . Pale yellow , to match her straw-gold dress . Long sleeves , gold trim at the neck and wrists and hem . Tiny , gold cloth buttons down the front . She was as tall as me without her shoes . <p> The purse slumped , and it clinked . Alone , untouched , it made a racket . Recita pushed away the purse with her bare feet . She took my hands , both at the same time , and tugged at them until they understood where they should go . My fingers slid into my back pants pockets where she sent them . She kissed a burning path across my jaw , nudged my chin with her chin . She tucked in my thumbs , too . <p> Her cheek pressed against mine . With her own hands she touched her face , her jaw and chin , her fingers blessing her own eyebrows and eyelids . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn smooth by time or by the caressing of her own fingers over time . " Red . Tell me . You have a plan ? " <p> I swear , the bulbs strewn over the floor gathered around my ankles , gathered and grew fingers . I kicked them away . They crept back . At the same moment my hands tried escaping , her arms captured my waist ; her hands flew into my back pockets . She said to me , said to my hands , " Stay inside . " Her fingers between my fingers , she pushed my hands flat against my hips . She wanted my hands to go deeper into my pockets , and so she forced them down , gentle but sure , which brought my pants low on my hips . " Stay there , " she said , and her fingertips showed my fingertips the curve of my own ass , inviting me to touch . Touch myself . <p> " Recita , " I said . " My dear . " <p> She said , " You are shy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Ohhh , Red , " she whispered , " we are in a greeeen house . " Her hands withdrew , her moist palms dampening my wrists . I watched her hands move behind her . How they moved was mysterious , reaching down behind her . Her lips tried to kiss my eyes closed , but I watched her hands . You would not ? <p> She turned her back to me and bent her knees and waist in order to lift the golden hem of her straw-colored dress , the whole hem . And now I saw how the moonlit green light of the green house made her golden dress the green-gold of cotton blossoms . The smooth material still in her hands , she drew her fingers up against the skin of her ankles and legs , and , slowly , her thighs . <p> Oh , my dear . <p> Old woman 's underwear . You will not see this underwear in magazines . No designer names , no printed words , no lace or floral wonders , but puckered elastic , plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I have my theories . When this underwear goes on , it does not take itself too seriously . When this underwear comes off ( Recita 's thumbs hooking the waistband , her hands almost completely inside , pushing this underwear down over her knees and ankles ) , when this underwear comes off ( one dance step , and she has kicked it away , and it lands around the purse , the silent purse ) , when this underwear comes off , it is part of A Plan . <p> Facing me again , she dropped the hem all at once . She did not take off the dress , under which she now had nothing but her legs , lovelier than they had ever been in my imagination . She touched but did not unbutton the cloth buttons at her breast and neck . How nice they must have felt , the material rougher than the material of her dress . I saw her pleasure . Under her eyes and at her cheeks was lovely greenness gilded by the deep brown of her skin . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Where is your purse ? " I asked . I looked around for it . Why did I look for it ? Concerned for her purse ! <p> She asked , " You are worried ? " <p> " Where has it gone ? " <p> " Not far , " she said . " She never goes far . " She made a little clap of her hands . " Heeeere , purse . Heeeere , purse . " <p> " Lost , " I said . My nose trickled . <p> " Wipe your nose , " she said , tender , funny , loving three words , good as any I have ever heard . She leaned her body against me , she reached behind me to free my hands . <p> I wiped , sniffed , and blew my nose right in front of her , and this seemed not at all strange . She took the rag from me and balled it up and put it back in my pocket for me . What do the young know of this kind of love ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth still heated from her touch . She unbuckled my belt . Buckled it one notch tighter . <p> We kissed . Our eyes were open . Recita 's hair was black , red , and silver , more red than black or silver , and I looked close . I leaned back from her and looked close at the falling waves on the top , the retreating flatter waves on the sides , the unbrushed tumble in back . <p> We kissed . I touched her woman 's beard , barely there , but there enough to illuminate the moonsilver on the skin of her neck and jaw . And around her mouth . Silver and seedling green . I tried to pray . This would be the time I should pray . Where was La Memoria ? Where had La Memoria gone ? <p> We kissed . Recita 's ears were low on her head . Smooth , small ears , low and far back on her head . I prayed : What now , God ? When I touched her ears , I swear this , I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What plan , God ? I need a plan . <p> We kissed . I had a crazy notion I could move her ears , and if I moved them far enough , they would be small wings at the back of her neck . She would fly a little ahead of me with them . Like a golden bee , she would hover over me . I pushed her ears back with my thumbs . She cupped my ears with her hands , my donkey ears . <p> How our ears delighted us ! We laughed together . We kissed . In the greeeen house . <p>
