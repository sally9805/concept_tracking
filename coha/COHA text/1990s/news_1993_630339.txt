<p> If Mayor Daley thinks it 's so easy and so necessary for Chicago teachers to have a 10 percent or 20 percent pay cut , then he also should introduce a bill to reduce his and the other city employees ' salaries by an equal amount . <p> After all , if these men and women were doing an exceptional job , the city government would have devised funding solutions for education a long time ago and have seen to it that the money was managed properly , too . <p> The teachers and voters of Illinois have backed income taxes , lotteries , bond issues and gambling all in the name of improved education funding ; however , once passed , the original funding as well as new funding somehow gets pared back far below what is needed . <p> It 's time we stop shortchanging and robbing teachers and students of what they deserve . Allan Goodkind , Skokie Gross Insult <p> The recent surge in commentaries attempting to deny that the Holocaust ever existed is offensive to the point of nausea . Even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not take place is a gross insult to those who suffered such horrors . Few events in history have been more thoroughly documented , not only by those who lived in the camps , but also by the very people who built them and did the awful work that occurred there . <p> Ironically , these denials are a very example of the " big lie " thesis : Tell a lie that even you know is a lie , and some few out there will believe it ; eventually the one who started the lie will himself accept it as truth . <p> But a lie is still a lie . Denials of the Holocaust may be taken as virulent anti-Semitism , or as the simplistic acceptance of wild distortions by those not interested enough to question . <p> I speak with particular reference to a Professor Arthur R. Butz of Northwestern University , and to a Mark Weber , the editor of the Journal of Historical Review , cited in a George F. Will column ( " Holocaust Deniers Peddle Fantasy of Hate , " Aug. 29 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others who still entertain the folly that the Holocaust did n't occur , to read a chapter in William Shirer 's book of the Hitler era , The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich . <p> Shirer details not only the hideous details of the concentration camp routines , but cites chapter and verse of the contracts that were let to construct the camps , build the ovens and supply the poison gas . He quotes actual memos and letters from the highest-ranking Nazi leaders . <p> In my view , only a fool could read the mountains of documentation , listen to the stories of actual survivors and read of the eyewitness accounts of those who stormed the camps toward the end of the war , and still deny what happened there . And , finally , as Will suggested , then go to the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington ; and then say it never was . John Loprieno , Elk Grove Village Dumb Idea <p> As a lifelong Hoosier , I read Richard Roeper 's Sept. 1 column ( " Spotting a Hoosier : It 's Hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise , then with disgust and finally with a shrug of the shoulders . It 's written tongue in cheek , I know , and , yes , Hoosiers can take a joke , but we can also spot rash generalizations and bad reasoning when we see them . <p> What a dumb idea to judge the whole state of Indiana and its people on Kenneth Lakeberg 's dress , demeanor and actions . That makes about as much sense as judging Illinois and its people by Richard Speck . <p> I wonder if Roeper realized that more than 50 percent of the home sales in Lake County , Ind. , are to people moving in from Illinois . What do they know about Indiana that a smart-aleck journalist has obviously missed ? Calvin Bellamy , president and chief executive officer , Calumet National Bank , Hammond Aid the Poor <p> In the next few months , Congress and the Clinton administration will make decisions that will significantly affect the poor and hungry in the world . Sen. Paul Simon ( D-Ill. ) is in a key position to influence much-needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cold War has ended , the United States has the opportunity to focus on global threats other than communism : global hunger , poverty and environmental destruction . Poverty sows the seeds of social unrest , illegal border crossings and mass migration as hungry people leave home in search of jobs . Environmental destruction occurs when the poor , in their hand-to-mouth existence , cut forests for fuel and clear land desperately needed for growing food . Poverty also contributes to instability inside the world 's emerging democracies . <p> We are at a historic juncture : We can forge a foreign aid program that actively promotes humanitarian concerns around the globe . By helping the world 's hungry and poor , we can help foster stable communities and states , and thus a stable globe , and slow the depletion of our dwindling natural resources . And if foreign aid helps poor people with no opportunities to become self-reliant , there will be no more need to provide aid to them in the future . <p> This month , the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will approve the foreign aid authorization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focusing aid on sustainable development rather than political considerations , but the final bill needs to put more emphasis on bottom-up approaches to development . It should expand economic opportunities for poor people , especially women , and address local environmental problems that directly affect poor people and their ability to become self-sufficient . <p> I ask Sen. Simon , who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , to stand up for these principles when the committee finalizes its foreign aid bill . He can make a difference . Teri Jacobs , manager of public information , World Relief Outrageous Story <p> I was outraged when I read the Aug. 24 news story ( " Up to 4,000 Iraqi Troops Begin Resettling in U.S. " ) that the United States has plans to resettle them at $ 4,000 per soldier . Our government is going to spend $ 16 million on these former enemy troops . <p> At a time of unprecedented national debt , when taxpayers are being asked to pay higher taxes , all we need now is the added burden of supporting enemy soldiers . Give Saddam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pullman Total Insult <p> The publication of Tyrone Walls ' letter Aug. 25 , was a total insult to the Mexican community . Walls ' comments seem to have come directly from Archie Bunker himself . <p> As history will tell us , the United States is supposed to be the land of opportunity for all since it has opened its doors to all foreigners who were escaping economic problems , food shortages , religious persecution , etc . <p> Yet , when it comes to the Mexican people living here in the United States , the government easily blames them for the economic problems of this country . The Mexican people are coming here for those same reasons , for " a better life . " <p> I ask those who blame the Mexicans , why do you not complain when the United States sends food , money , soldiers to foreign countries such as Bosnia-Herzegovina , Russia , Somalia , etc. ? What economic help/food do they send to the United States ? None ! The Mexicans come to the United States to find work , accepting whatever pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet there is clearly a double standard when it comes to them residing here and receiving benefits . Paying taxes is fine , but receiving benefits is not . June Ocon , South Lawndale Do n't Blame Race <p> Responding to James Jordan 's tragic death , Vernon Jarrett ( " New , Amoral Climate Is Leading to Violence , " column , Aug. 19 ) states that the alleged perpetrators ( one black , one Native American ) represent " a new generation of young blacks that has adopted the white racist attitudes that led to the oppression - including maiming and murder - of their ancestors . " <p> Why blame white society for Jordan 's death ? Whites - present or past - had nothing whatsoever to do with his death - either actually or symbolically . Why not recognize the fact that individuals - not races - are responsible for their actions ? <p> Some individuals , regardless of their ethnicity , religion or race , are evil . They hate and kill , and they do so in a rational , heartless manner . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their race . Instead of concentrating on race , zero in on individual behavior . Ralph J.
