<p> Achilles , that ancient and illustrious weekend warrior , had a heel problem of his own . But the tendon that bears his name has caused trouble for many a latter-day gladiator , from pro football stars like Sonny Jurgensen and Dan Marino to gym rats like Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and Vice President Al Gore . <p> Gore tore his Achilles ' tendon last August during a pickup basketball game with former congressional colleagues in the House of Representatives gymnasium . He had surgery at Bethesda Naval Medical Center and was on crutches till early this month . He still wears a knee-to-ankle leg brace to keep the repaired tendon from flexing too much . <p> Less than a month after Gore was felled on the basketball court , the Clinton administration 's solicitor general Drew Days sustained a similar injury in a softball game . Justice Thomas was on crutches for several months last year after tearing an Achilles ' tendon during a basketball game with law clerks . <p> " It 's a devastating injury , " said David C. Novicki , president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All of a sudden , they feel like someone hit them in the back of the leg with a baseball bat . " <p> Walking is not only painful , it 's nearly impossible . <p> Veteran Redskins fans will never forget the image of Sonny Jurgensen hobbling off the field in agony during Game 7 of the 1972 season , his Achilles ' tendon snapped . He had stepped in a pothole in Yankee Stadium and would miss the rest of the season , including the Super Bowl . <p> The Achilles ' tendon anchors the powerful muscles of the calf to the heel of the foot . Beginning as a wide fibrous sheath at the calf muscles , it tapers to a cord at the back of the ankle . <p> " It 's the largest tendon in the body , connected to the strongest muscle , " said Steve Smith , an orthopedic surgeon and a team physician for the U.S. national soccer squad . <p> It 's part of the muscle group that allows humans to push off and propel their entire body weight when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every time you stride , leap or lunge , you push off and flex the Achilles ' tendon  --  and then flex it again when the foot lands . <p> If a too-taut tendon is suddenly flexed  --  during a leap from the basketball court , say , or a stumble off a sidewalk curb  --  it can strain , fray or even snap at a weak point . <p> Star quarterback Dan Marino of the Miami Dolphins tore his Achilles ' tendon as he dropped back to pass in a game against Cleveland last year and missed most of the 1993 season . This year , back in top form at age 33 after surgery and a long off-season recovery , Marino is leading the first-place Dolphins into the playoffs . <p> Unfortunately , his coach , Don Shula , has to ride the sidelines while perched on a golf cart . That 's because Shula , 64 , underwent surgery this month to repair his Achilles ' tendon , which he snapped while walking back to his office after practice . <p> Marino and Shula are n't alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendon in the opening game of the season . Less heroically , Redskins general manager Charley Casserly has been on crutches since Nov. 30 , when he underwent surgery to repair a torn Achilles ' tendon . Casserly slipped on a wet , grassy embankment on the way to his car . <p> It 's the same injury that effectively ended the stellar careers of guard Isiah Thomas of the Detroit Pistons and distance runner John Walker of New Zealand . Other top athletes who have been cut down by Achilles ' tendon tears include football legends quarterback Johnny Unitas of the Baltimore Colts , linebacker Lawrence Taylor of the New York Giants and basketball 's eight-time All-Star Dominique Wilkins . <p> Sprinter Mark Witherspoon tore his during the 1992 Olympic trials . Brian Snow , a dancer with the Royal Ballet , snapped his while dancing the last act of " Sleeping Beauty . " San Francisco Giants rightfielder Willie McGee ripped his when he crashed into the outfield wall last season . <p> Then there 's the symmetrically sad example of pro basketball player Stanley Roberts , who plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his first game since rupturing his right Achilles ' tendon 10 months earlier , Roberts snapped his left one . <p> If the patient is lucky , the damage will heal without surgery , with the leg immobilized for months in a cast . More likely , intricate surgery is necessary to reattach the shredded ends of the torn tendon . <p> " Just picture trying to sew two paintbrushes together , " Novicki said . <p> With or without surgery , the patient is in for a long-haul rehabilitation to gradually stretch and strengthen the tendon without reinjuring it . Full recovery usually takes six months to a year , with the patient on crutches for the first eight to 12 weeks . <p> Achilles ' tendon injuries are most common in stop-and-go sports demanding sudden leaping , lunging or sprinting . Football , basketball , tennis and volleyball are prime examples . <p> In a three-year survey of emergency room patients treated in a suburban Atlanta medical center , podiatrists found 23 cases of strained or ruptured Achilles ' tendon . All the ruptured tendons were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who conducted the survey . Each was playing basketball at the time of the injury . <p> The tendon is named for Achilles , the Greek hero of the Trojan War , who was killed when an arrow shot by Paris struck him in the heel . Achilles had been dipped in the River Styx by his mother , rendering him invulnerable  --  except in the heel by which she had held him . <p> While by no means unheard of in women , Achilles ' tendon injuries are more common in men , said Smith , who is based at Metro Orthopedics and Sports Therapy in Silver Spring . That 's partly because women 's musculoskeletal systems tend to be more flexible , and also because they weigh less , on average , which puts less force on the foot and leg . <p> Although Achilles ' tendon injuries strike professional athletes and people of all ages , Smith said , " the more likely scenario is in the over-30 recreational athlete who goes out and tries to keep up with the young guys . " <p> Harold D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia , calls them social athletes or " athloids . " <p> It 's usually the " weekend warrior " who played basketball or tennis when he was in high school and does n't realize he 's no longer young , Novicki agreed . " He rushes home from work , throws on his gear , does n't take the time to loosen up , goes out there cold and  --  bam !  --  he 's down . " <p> Much more common than the catastrophic rupture of the Achilles ' tendon is soreness caused by inflammation in the tendon  --  or tendinitis . The symptoms range from mild discomfort to pain severe enough to interfere with walking . <p> The repetitive stress of a foot pounding the pavement affects alike the weekend jogger and the heart patient recovering from bypass surgery by daily walks in a shopping mall . <p> Chronic tendinitis can be treated or controlled in several ways : cutting back or varying the exercise routine ; nonprescription anti-inflammatory painkillers such as aspirin or ibuprofen ; arch supports or orthotics to relieve tension on the Achilles ' tendon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot takes during a long walk or run ; and ice packs to reduce swelling after exercise . <p> Some athletes even use a bag of frozen vegetables as a makeshift ice pack . " Frozen peas are n't bad for this , " said orthopedic surgeon Smith . " They 're relatively inexpensive , reusable and usually close at hand . " <p> But the best way to control tendinitis is to prevent it in the first place  --  by warming up properly with stretches . <p> One good way to loosen up the calves and Achilles ' tendons , both before and after exercise , is to stand on a stair step , facing upstairs . With the balls of the feet on the stair , lower the heel of one foot over the stair edge , until a stretch is felt . Hold for at least 10 seconds , and repeat five times with each foot . <p> People who are n't used to exercise or who work out only once a week will require more warmup . <p> Professional athletes , as well as high school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conditioning and limbering up before practices and games . <p> Fifteen or 20 years ago , Novicki said , hulking pro football players " would n't be caught dead doing so-called ballerina-type exercises . <p> " Now they 're being forced to do them by their trainers .
