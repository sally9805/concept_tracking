<p> James Marshall is , to put it mildly , a remarkable man . Using martial arts , stealth and sheer grit , he battles a planeload of terrorists , but not without a twinge of conscience . He fights for the lives of dozens of other Americans on board , including his wife and their courageous daughter . In the process , he tries to establish the United States as a bulwark of principle in a world of self-interest . <p> And by the way , he 's the President of the United States , a man more concerned with morals than with votes . <p> Hollywood has only rarely put a positive spin on American Presidents of late , as in " Independence Day " and " The American President . " But in " Air Force One , " Harrison Ford portrays the President as such an earnest and unblemished paragon of virtue that the movie plays as Rambo on wings , a paean to patriotism . The United States is presented as the best hope in a dark world . Should audiences miss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie ( which brought in an estimated $37.1 million in its first weekend ) , when the President must guess which wires to connect in a control panel and remarks that the red , white and blue ones must never be crossed . <p> Historically , Hollywood has not been shy about wrapping itself in the flag when that suited its purposes , but what 's noteworthy here is that the studio is Columbia Pictures , owned by Sony , the giant Japanese company . <p> In 1989 , when the Sony Corporation acquired Columbia for $3.5 billion , followed by Matsushita 's acquisition of MCA and Universal Pictures for $6.1 billion a few months later , it caused a wave of fear . Some Americans warned that the Japanese companies , battering their American competitors in the trade wars , would now subvert the content of movies . It seemed that an economic battle had turned into a battle for America 's cultural soul . A cover article in Newsweek proclaimed , " Japan Invades Hollywood . " <p> There was even concern that the vast movie library owned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who protects the interests of the people of the United States when it comes to these motion pictures ? " George Stevens Jr. , the head of the American Film Institute , asked in Congressional testimony at that time . " How will future generations judge us if we allow these expressions of the American spirit to be lost to us ? " <p> That seems a long time ago . The Japanese economy is struggling today with a recession that began in 1990 , while the American economy is soaring . Numerous Japanese companies have lost billions of dollars on ill-considered purchases of American real estate and American companies , including Sony , which has only recently began to recover from its own losses . The cultural heart of the United States appears to be beating strongly . <p> If anything , the fears today in Hollywood concern China , which owns no studios but has objected strongly to the content of two coming films on Tibet , a country forcibly annexed by Beijing . There are " Seven Years in Tibet , " produced by Sony 's Tri-Star studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that studios may be pressured into censoring films that are perceived as critical of China to insure future access to the Chinese market . <p> " We have always feared foreign influence in ways that were mostly overstated , " said Jeffrey Garten , the dean of the Yale School of Management and a former senior Commerce Department official involved in trade issues with Japan . " In the 1970 's we thought Arab money would take over the U.S. And then it was Japan . Now we 're worried about Chinese influence . " <p> He added : " The real irony is that it 's American culture dominating everyone else . We 've been looking through the wrong end of the telescope . " <p> " Air Force One " is just a thriller ( directed , as it happens , by Wolfgang Petersen , a German ) , but it reinforces the view that what Sony wants more than anything , after suffering billions of dollars in losses on its movie studio acquisition , is a profit , not control over the content of movies . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better job preserving its American film classics than American-owned studios . <p> " Obviously , our strategic and financial interests are mutual , but all creative decisions are exclusively local , " insisted John Calley , the president of Sony Pictures Entertainment , the studio unit that oversees Columbia and Tri-Star . " We 're accountable for all decisions about movie selection and production , as we should be . " Yuki Nozoe , an executive vice president at Sony Pictures Entertainment and the sole Japanese executive on the studio lot , added , " We usually talk only about how we can do business from their creative ideas , consumer tie-ins and marketing . " <p> Nobuyuki Idei , the tough-minded , hands-on president of the Sony Corporation , was in town two weeks ago for a series of meetings and viewed for the first time Columbia 's current hit movie , " Men in Black . " Several people recalled that afterward he quickly asked one thing , " Will it make money ? " <p> That concern is understandable , considering that Sony 's flier in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of embarrassment . After acquiring Columbia and Tri-Star , Sony went on to spend more than $700 million to bring in Jon Peters and Peter Guber to run the studios . The two producers , who had made films like " Batman " for Warner Brothers , already had a reputation in Hollywood for spending freely . The studio unit 's revenues declined steadily through the fiscal year ending March 31 , 1996 , and Sony took a $3.2 billion loss in 1994 . Rebounding To a Record Year <p> Making things worse , the new management team , Alan J. Levine and Mark Canton , was also regarded as ineffectual . They , too , were forced out late last year , to be replaced by Mr. Calley ; Lucy Fisher , the vice chairwoman of Columbia Tri-Star Motion Pictures , and Gareth Wigan , co-vice chairman . <p> But the studios began to rebound strongly last year , and in 1997 they are experiencing a record year . " Jerry Maguire , " " Men in Black , " " My Best Friend 's Wedding " and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box office . These films were all developed by Mr. Levine and Mr. Canton , the discredited management team . And Sony is now seen not as a company bent on controlling its studios ' output , but as a struggling Hollywood newcomer eager for little more than stability and a profit . <p> " I never took all that talk about the Japanese seriously , " said Rupert Murdoch , the chairman of the News Corporation , the Australian company that owns the 20th Century Fox studio . " I always thought that if they had been so foolish as to try and control the movies , the public would have destroyed them . " <p> He added : " If anything , the subversive films , the films questioning American values , American traditions , have all come from Americans . This is all really a non-issue . " <p> Tom Pollock , who had been head of Universal Studios when Matsushita bought MCA , said : " Let 's be honest , most of those fears at that time , they were more about racism than anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are making movies that made them before . Hollywood is a culture that deals with itself . Japanese ownership did n't change that . " <p> In fact , there have been changes in ownership . After suffering through poor returns and conflict with the American management of MCA , Matsushita sold 80 percent of its shareholding to Seagram two years ago . Sony has held talks on several occasions in an effort to sell all or part of its studios . Sony insists that the studios are not on the block now , and they are enjoying their most profitable year ever . <p> Mr. Pollock and executives at Sony 's studios said that their Japanese owners had never vetted scripts or insisted on reviewing the contents of movies . Nevertheless , there have been several instances when there were fears about interference from Tokyo . Universal Pictures made a 1991 film , " Mr. Baseball , " about an American baseball player who collides with Japanese culture when he goes to play in Japan . Two jokes that referred to World War II were eliminated , and the script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the changes were simply an effort to make a lackluster film better . War Remains A Sensitive Subject <p> In another example , " Hell Camp , " a Columbia Pictures comedy about an American sumo wrestler in Japan , was killed at the last minute . At the time , executives said the problem was with the Sumo Association in Japan , which refused to cooperate with the project . Mike Medavoy , who was then the head of the studio , said that Sony had tried to help gain clearance but failed , and he said there was no censorship at all . <p> A particularly sensitive subject is still World War II , which some thought might be a test of the Japanese studio owners . Mr. Medavoy said he is currently producing " The Thin Red Line , " the second film to be made from the James Jones novel about the American defeat of Japan at Guadalcanal . The executive producer , interestingly , is George Stevens . Mr. Medavoy said he had taken the project to Sony , which passed , and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movie . <p> Asked if Japanese sensitivities were involved , he said : " Not at all . This was purely commercial . I know that if they thought it would have made money , they would have done it . I was more enthusiastic about it than they were , and that 's what this business is all about . " <p> Chart/Graph : " SONY " 1989  --  Sony Corporation paid $3.5 billion for Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star Pictures , and set up Sony Pictures Entertainment to oversee the studios .
