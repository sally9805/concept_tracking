Prologue My name is Christopher Snow . The following account is an installment in my personal journal . If you are reading it , I am probably dead . If I am not dead , then because of the reportage herein , I am now -- or soon will be -- one of the most famous people on the planet . If no one ever reads this , it will be because the world as we know it has ceased to exist and human civilization is gone forever . I am no more vain than the average person , and instead of universal recognition , I prefer the peace of anonymity . Nevertheless , if the choice is between Armageddon and fame , I 'd prefer to be famous . Elsewhere , night falls , but in Moonlight Bay it steals upon us with barely a whisper , like a gentle dark-sapphire surf licking a beach . At dawn , when the night retreats across the pacific toward distant Asia , it is reluctant to go , leaving deep black pools in alleyways , under parked cars , in culverts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tibetan folklore , a secret sanctuary in the sacred Himalayas is the home of all wind , from which every breeze and raging storm throughout the world is born . If the night , too , has a special home , our town is no doubt the place . On the eleventh of April , as the night passed through Moonlight Bay on its way westward , it took with it a five-year-old boy named Jimmy Wing . Near midnight , I was on my bicycle , cruising the residential streets in the lower hills not far from Ashdon College , where my murdered parents had once been professors . Earlier , I had been to the beach , but although there was no wind , the surf was mushy ; the sloppy waves did n't make it worthwhile to suit up and float a board . Orson , a black Labrador mix , trotted at my side . Fur face and I were not looking for adventure , merely getting some fresh air and satisfying our mutual need to be on the move . A restlessness of the soul plagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a fool or a madman goes looking for adventure in picturesque Moonlight Bay , which is simultaneously one of the quietest and most dangerous communities on the planet . Here , if you stand in one place long enough , a lifetime 's worth of adventure will find you . Lilly Wing lives on a street shaded and scented by stone pines . In the absence of lampposts , the trunks and twisted branches were as black as char , except where moonlight pierced the feathery boughs and silvered the rough bark . I became aware of her when the beam of a flashlight swept back and forth between the tree trunks . A quick pendulum of light arced across the pavement ahead of me , and tree shadows jumped . She called her son 's name , trying to shout but defeated by breathlessness and by a quiver of panic that transformed Jimmy into a six -- syllable word . Because no traffic was in sight ahead of or behind us , Orson and I were traveling the center of the pavement : kings of the road . We swung to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the street , I said , " What 's wrong , Badger ? " For twelve years , since we were sixteen , " Badger " has been my affectionate nickname for her . In those days , her name was Lilly Travis , and we were in love and believed that a future together was our destiny . Among our long list of shared enthusiasms and passions was a special fondness for Kenneth Grahame 's The Wind in the Willows , in which the wise and courageous Badger was the stalwart defender of all good animals in the Wild Wood . " Any friend of mine walks where he likes in this country , " Badger had promised Mole , " or I 'll know the reason why ! " Likewise , those who shunned me because of my rare disability , those who called me vampire because of my inherited lack of tolerance for more than the dimmest light , those teenage psychopaths who plotted to torture me with fists and flashlights , those who spoke maliciously of me behind my back , as if I 'd chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lilly , whose face flushed and whose heart raced with righteous anger at any exhibition of intolerance . As a young boy , out of urgent necessity , I learned to fight , and by the time I met Lilly , I was confident of my ability to defend myself ; nevertheless , she had insisted on coming to my aid as fiercely as the noble Badger ever fought with claw and cudgel for his friend Mole . Although slender , she is mighty . Only five feet four , she appears to tower over any adversary . She is as formidable , fearless , and fierce as she is graceful and good-hearted . This night , however , her usual grace had deserted her , and fright had tortured her bones into unnatural angles . When I spoke , she twitched around to face me , and in her jeans and untucked flannel shirt , she seemed to be a bristling scarecrow now magically animated , confused and terrified to find itself suddenly alive , jerking at its supporting cross . The beam of her flashlight bathed my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant she realized who I was . " Chris . Oh , God . " " What 's wrong ? " I asked again as I got off my bike . " Jimmy 's gone . " " Run away ? " " No . " She turned from me and hurried toward the house . " This way , here , look . " Lilly 's property is ringed by a white picket fence that she herself built . The entrance is flanked not by gateposts but by matched bougainvillea that she has pruned into trees and trained into a canopy . Her modest Cape Cod bungalow lies at the end of an intricately patterned brick walkway that she designed and laid after teaching herself masonry from books . The front door stood open . Enticing rooms of deadly brightness lay beyond . Instead of taking me and Orson inside , Lilly quickly led us off the bricks and across the lawn . In the still night , as I pushed my bike through the closely cropped grass , the tick of wheel bearings was the loudest sound . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom window had been raised . Inside , a single lamp glowed , and the walls were striped with amber light and faint honey-brown shadows from the folded cloth of the pleated shade . To the left of the bed , Star Wars action figures stood on a set of bookshelves . As the cool night sucked warmth from the house , one panel of the curtains was drawn across the sill , pale and fluttering like a troubled spirit reluctant to leave this world for the next . " I thought the window was locked , but it must n't have been , " Lilly said frantically . " Someone opened it , some sonofabitch , and he took Jimmy away . " Maybe it 's not that bad . " " Some sick bastard , " she insisted . The flashlight jiggled , and Lilly struggled to still her trembling hand as she directed the beam at the planting bed alongside the house . " I do n't have any money , " she said . " Money ? " " To pay ransom . I 'm not rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's worse than that . " False Solomon 's seal , laden with feathery sprays of white flowers that glittered like ice , had been trampled by the intruder . Footprints were impressed in trodden leaves and soft damp soil . They were not the prints of a runaway child but those of an adult in athletic shoes with bold tread , and judging by the depth of the impressions , the kidnapper was a large person , most likely male . I saw that Lilly was barefoot . " I could n't sleep , I was watching TV , some stupid show on the TV , " she said with a note of self-flagellation , as if she should have anticipated this abduction and been at Jimmy 's bedside , ever vigilant . Orson pushed between us to sniff the imprinted earth . " I did n't hear anything , " Lilly said . " Jimmy never cried out , but I got this feeling .... " Her usual beauty , as clear and deep as a reflection of eternity , was now shattered by terror , crazed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was held together only by desperate hope . Even in the dim backwash of the flashlight , I could hardly bear the sight of her in such pain . " It 'll be all right , " I said , ashamed of this facile lie . " I called the police , " she said . " They should be here any second . Where are they ? " Personal experience had taught me to distrust the authorities in Moonlight Bay . They are corrupt . And the corruption is not merely moral , not simply a matter of bribe-taking and a taste for power ; it has deeper and more disturbing origins . No siren shrieked in the distance , and I did n't expect to hear one . In our special town , the police answer calls with utmost discretion , without even the quiet fanfare of flashing emergency lights , because as often as not , their purpose is to conceal a crime and silence the complainant rather than to bring the perpetrator to justice . " He 's only five , only five , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that guy on the news ? " " The news ? " " The serial killer . The one who ... burns kids . " " That 's not around here . " " All over the country . Every few months . Groups of little kids burned alive . Why not here ? " " Because it is n't , " I said , " It 's something else . " She swung away from the window and raked the yard with the flashlight beam , as though she hoped to discover her tousle-haired , pajama-clad son among the fallen leaves and the curled strips of papery bark that littered the grass under a row of tall eucalyptus trees . Catching a troubling scent , Orson issued a low growl and backed away from the planting bed . He peered up at the windowsill , sniffed the air , put his nose to the ground again , and headed tentatively toward the rear of the house . " He 's got something , " I said . Lilly turned . " Got what ? " " A trail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trot . " Badger , " I said , " do n't tell them that Orson and I were here . " A weight of fear pressed her voice thinner than a whisper . " Do n't tell who ? " " The police . " " Why ? " " I 'll be back . I 'll explain . I swear I 'll find Jimmy . I swear I will . " I could keep the first two promises . The third , however , was something less meaningful than wishful thinking and was intended only to provide a little hope with which she might keep herself glued together . In fact , as I hurried after my strange dog , pushing the bicycle at my side , I already believed that Jimmy Wing was lost forever . The most I expected to find at the end of the trail was the boy 's dead body and , with luck , the man who had murdered him . Chapter Two When I reached the rear of Lilly 's house , I could n't see Orson . He was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not sufficient to reveal him . From off to the right came a soft woof , then another , and I followed his call . At the end of the backyard was a freestanding garage that could be entered by car only from the alley beyond . A brick walkway led alongside the garage to a wooden gate , where Orson stood on his hind legs , pawing at the latch . For a fact , this dog is radically smarter than ordinary mutts . Sometimes I suspect that he is also considerably smarter than I am . If I did n't have the advantage of hands , no doubt I would be the one eating from a dish on the floor . He would have control of the most comfortable easy chair and the remote control for the television . Demonstrating my single claim to superiority , I disengaged the bolt latch with a flourish and pushed open the creaking gate . A series of garages , storage sheds , and backyard fences lay along this flank of the alley . On the farther side , the cracked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in turn led to a like of massive eucalyptuses and a weedy verge that sloped into a canyon . Lilly 's house is on the edge of town , and no one lives in the canyon beyond her place . The wild grass and scattered scrub oaks on the descending slopes provide homes for hawks , coyotes , rabbits , squirrels , field mice , and snakes . Following his formidable nose , Orson urgently investigated the weeds along the edge of the canyon , padding north and then south , softly whining and grumbling to himself . I stood at the brink , between two trees , peering down into a darkness that not even the fat moon could dispel . No flashlight moved in those depths . If Jimmy had been carried into that gloom , the kidnapper must have uncanny night vision . With a yelp , Orson abruptly abandoned his search along the canyon rim and returned to the center of the alleyway . He moved in a circle , as though he might start chasing his tail , but his head was raised and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a rich stew of scents . Every dog has a sense of smell thousands of times more powerful than yours or mine . The medicinal pungency of the eucalyptus trees was the only aroma that I could detect . Drawn by another and more suspicious scent , as if he were but a bit of iron pulled inexorably toward a powerful magnet , Orson raced north along the alley . Maybe Jimmy Wing was still alive . It 's my nature to believe in miracles . So why not believe in this one . I climbed on my bike and pedaled after the dog . He was swift and certain , and to match his pace , I really had to make the drive chain hum . In block after block , only a few widely spaced security lamps glowed at the back of the residential properties that we passed . By habit I steered away from those radiant pools , along the darker side of the alleyway , even though I could have sailed through each patch of lamplight in less than a second or so , without significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't able to tie their tongues in knots -- is an inherited genetic disorder that I share with an exclusive club of only one thousand other Americans . One of us per 250,000 citizens . XP renders me highly vulnerable to skin and eye cancers caused by exposure to any ultraviolet radiation . Sunshine . Incandescent or fluorescent bulbs . The shining , idiot face of a television screen . If I dared to spend just half an hour in summer sun , I would burn severely , though a single searing would n't kill me . The true horror of XP , however , is that even minor exposure to ultraviolet radiation shortens my life , because the effect is cumulative . Years of imperceptible injuries accrete until they manifest as visible lesions , malignancies . Six hundred minutes of exposure , spread one by one over an entire year , will have the same ultimate effect as ten continuous hours on a beach in brightest July .

Your body , unlike mine , continuously produces enzymes that strip out the damaged segments of nucleotide strands in your cells , replacing them with undamaged DNA . I must exist in shadows , while you live under exquisitely blue skies , and yet I do n't hate you . I do n't resent you for the freedom that you take for granted-although I do envy you . I do n't hate you because , after all , you are human , too , and therefore have limitations of your own . Perhaps you are homely , slow-witted or too smart for your own good , deaf or mute or blind , by nature given to despair or to self-hatred , or perhaps you are unusually fearful of Death himself . We all have burdens .

Rather than rage against XP , I regard it as a blessing . My passage through life is unique . For one thing , I have a singular familiarity with the night . I know the world between dusk and dawn as no one else can know it , for I am a brother to the owl and the bat and the badger . I am at home in the darkness . This can be a greater advantage than you might think . Of course , no number of advantages can compensate for the fact that death before the age of consent is not uncommon for those with XP . Survival far into adulthood is n't a reasonable expectation -- at least not without progressive neurological disorders such as tremors of the head and hands , hearing loss , slurred speech , even mental impairment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retribution . I 've also been spared all the physical infirmities that my physicians have long predicted . I am twenty-eight years old . To say that I am living on borrowed time would be not merely a clich but also an understatement . My entire life has been a heavily mortgaged enterprise . But so is yours . Eventual foreclosure awaits all of us . More likely than not , I 'll receive my notice before you do , though yours , too , is in the mail . Nevertheless , until the postman comes , be happy . There is no other rational response but happiness . Despair is a foolish squandering of precious time . Now , here , on this cool spring night , past the witching hour but with dawn still far away , chasing my sherlock hound , believing in the miracle of Jimmy Wing 's survival , I cycled along empty alleys and deserted avenues , through a park where Orson did not pause to sniff a single tree , past the high school , onto lower streets . He led me eventually to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heights to the bay . In this part of California , where annual rainfall averages a mere fourteen inches , rivers and streams are parched most of the year . The recent rainy season had been no wetter than usual , and this riverbed was entirely exposed : a broad expanse of powdery silt , pale and slightly lustrous in the lunar light . It was as smooth as a bedsheet except for scattered knots of dark driftwood like sleeping homeless men whose limbs were twisted by nightmares . In fact , though it was sixty to seventy feet wide , the Santa Rosita looked less like a real river than like a man-made drainage channel or canal . As part of an elaborate federal project to control the flash floods that could swell suddenly out of the steep hills and narrow canyons at the back door of Moonlight Bay , these riverbanks had been raised and stabilized with wide concrete levees from one end of town to the other . Orson trotted off the street , across a barren strip of land , to the levee . Following him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternated with each other for the entire length of the watercourse . The first declared that public access to the river was restricted and that anti-trespassing ordinances would be enforced . The second , directed at those lawless citizens who were undeterred by the first sign , warned that high water at a storm 's peak could be so powerful and fast-moving that it would overwhelm anyone who dared to venture into it . In spite of all the warnings , in spite of the obvious turbulence of the treacherous currents and the well-known tragic history of the Santa Rosita , a thrill seeker with a homemade raft or a kayak-or even just a pair of water wings-is swept to his death every few years . In a single winter , not long ago , three drowned . Human beings can always be relied upon to assert , with vigor , their God-given right to be stupid . Orson stood on the levee , burly head raised , gazing east toward the Pacific Coast Highway and the serried hills beyond . He was stiff with tension , and a thin whine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else moved along the moonlit channel . Not enough of a breeze slipped off the Pacific even to stir a dust ghost from the silt . Orson trotted to a wide concrete access ramp that descended along the levee wall to the Santa Rosita . In June and July , dump trucks and excavators would use this route when maintenance crews removed a year 's worth of accumulated sediment and debris from below , restoring a flood-preventing depth to the dry watercourse before the next rainy season . I followed the dog down to the riverbed . On the darkly mottled concrete slope , his black form was no more substantial than a shadow . On the faintly luminous silt , however , he appeared to be stone solid even as he drifted eastward like a homeward-bound spirit crossing a waterless Styx . Because the most recent rainfall had occurred three weeks in the past , the floor of the channel was n't damp . It was still well compacted , however , and I was able to ride the bicycle without struggle . At least as far as the pearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hard-packed silt , but a heavier vehicle had passed this way earlier , leaving clear tracks . Judging by the width and depth of the tread impressions , the tires were those of a van , a light truck , or a sports utility vehicle . Flanked by twenty-foot-high concrete ramparts , I had no view of any of the town immediately around us . I could see only the faint angular lines of the houses on higher hills , huddled under trees or partially revealed by streetlamps . As we ascended the watercourse , the townscape ahead also fell away from sight beyond the levees , as though the night were a powerful solvent in which all the structures and citizens of Moonlight Bay were dissolving . At irregular intervals , drainage culverts yawned in the levee walls , some only two or three feet in diameter , a few so large that a truck could have been driven into them . The tire tracks led past all those tributaries and continued up the riverbed , as straight as typed sentences on a sheet of paper , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orson 's attention remained focused ahead , I regarded the culverts with suspicion . During a cloudburst , torrents gushed out of them , carried from the streets and from the natural drainage swales high in the grassy eastern hills above town . Now , in fair weather , these storm drains were the subterranean lanes of a secret world , in which one might encounter exceptionally strange travelers . I half expected someone to rush at me from one of them . I admit to having an imagination feverish enough to melt good judgment . Occasionally it has gotten me into trouble , but more than once it has saved my life . Besides , having roamed all the storm drains large enough to accommodate a man my size , I 've encountered a few peculiar tableaux . Oddities and enigmas . Sights to wring fright from even the driest rag of imagination . Because the sun rises inevitably every day , my night life must be conducted within the town limits , to ensure that I 'm always close to the safely darkened rooms of my house when dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twelve thousand and a student population , at Ashdon College , of an additional three thousand , it offers a reasonably large board for a game of life ; it ca n't fairly be called a jerkwater burg . Nevertheless , by the time I was sixteen , I knew every inch of Moonlight Bay better than I knew the territory inside my own head . Consequently , to fend off boredom , I am always seeking new perspectives on the slice of the world to which XP confines me ; for a while I was intrigued by the view from below , touring the storm drains as if I were the Phantom prowling the realms beneath the Paris Opera House , though I lacked his cape , cloche hat , scars , and insanity . Recently , I 've preferred to keep to the surface . Like everyone born into this world , I 'll take up permanent residence underground soon enough . Now , after we passed another culvert without being assaulted , Orson suddenly picked up his pace . The trail had gotten hot . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until it was only forty feet wide where it passed under Highway 1 . This tunnel was more than a hundred feet long , and although faint silvery moonlight glimmered at the farther end , the way ahead was dauntingly dark . Apparently , Orson 's reliable nose did n't detect any danger . He was n't growling . On the other hand , he did n't sprint confidently into the gloom , either . He stood at the entrance , his tail still , his ears pricked , alert . For years I have traveled the night with only a modest amount of cash for the infrequent purchases I make , a small flashlight for those rare instances when darkness might be more of a enemy than a friend , and a compact cell phone clipped to my belt . Recently , I 'd added one other item to my standard kit : a 9-millimeter Glock pistol . Under my jacket , the Glock hung in a supple shoulder holster . I did n't need to touch the gun to know that it was there ; the weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , I slipped one hand under the coat and pressed my fingertips against the grip of the pistol as a superstitious person might touch a talisman . In addition to the black leather jacket , I was dressed in black Rockports , black socks , black jeans , and a black long-sleeve cotton pullover . The black-on-black is not because I style myself after vampires , priests , ninja assassins , or Hollywood celebrities . In this town , at night , wisdom requires you to be well armed but also to blend with the shadows , calling as little attention to yourself as possible . Leaving the Glock in the holster , still straddling my bike but with both feet on the ground , I unclipped the small flashlight from the handlebars . My bicycle does n't have a headlamp . I have lived so many years in the night and in rooms lit mostly by candles that my dark-adapted eyes do n't often need assistance . The beam penetrated perhaps thirty feet into the concrete tunnel , which had straight walls but an arched ceiling . No threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventured inside . Before following the dog , I listened to the traffic roaring south and north on Highway 1 , far above . To me , as always , this sound was simultaneously thrilling and melancholy . I 've never driven a car and probably never will . Even if I protected my hands with gloves and my face with a mask , the ceaseless oncoming headlights would pose a danger to my eyes . Besides , I could n't go any significant distance north or south along the coast and still return home before sunrise . Relishing the drone of the traffic , I peered up the broad concrete buttress in which the river tunnel was set . At the top of this long incline , headlights flared off the steel guardrails that defined the shoulder of the highway , but I could n't see the passing vehicles . What I did see -- or thought I saw -- from the corner of my eye , was someone crouched up there , to the south of me , a figure not quite as black as the night around him , fitfully backlit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just this side of the guardrails , barely visible yet with an aura as menacing as a gargoyle at the corner of a cathedral parapet . When I turned my head for a better look , the lights from a dense cluster of speeding cars and trucks caused shadows to leap like an immense flock of ravens taking flight in a lightning storm . Among those swooping phantoms , an apparently more solid figure raced diagonally downward , moving away from me and from the buttress , south along the grassy embankment . In but a flicker of time , he was beyond the reach of the strobing headlights , lost in the deeper darkness and also blocked from view by the levee walls that towered twenty feet above me . He might be circling back to the edge of the channel , intending to enter the riverbed above me . Or he might not be interested in me at all . Though it would be comforting to think that galaxies revolve around me , I am not the center of the universe . In fact , this mysterious figure might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpse of it that I could n't be absolutely certain it was more than an illusion . Again I reached under my coat and touched the Glock . Orson had padded so far into the passageway beneath Highway One that he was almost beyond the reach of my flashlight . After glancing at the channel behind me and seeing no stalker , I followed the dog . Instead of riding my bike , I walked beside it , guiding it with my left hand . I did n't like having my right hand -- my gun hand -- occupied with the flashlight . Besides , the light made me easy to follow and easy to target . Although the riverbed was dry , the walls of the tunnel gave off a not unpleasant damp odor , and the cool air was scented with a trace of lime from the concrete . From the roadbed high above , the rumble-hum of passing cars and trucks translated all the way down through layers of steel , concrete , and earth , echoing across the vault overhead . Repeatedly , in spite of the screening thrum of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each time I swung toward the sound , the flashlight revealed only the smooth concrete walls and the deserted river behind me . The tire tracks continued through the tunnel into another open stretch of the Santa Rosita , where I switched off the flashlight , relieved to rely on ambient light . The channel curved to the right , out of sight , leading east-southeast away from Highway 1 , rising at a steeper grade than before . Although houses still stippled the surrounding hills , we were nearing the edge of town . I knew where we were going . I had known for some time but was disturbed by the prospect . If Orson was on the right trail and if Jimmy Wing 's abductor was driving the vehicle that had left these tracks , then the kidnapper had fled with the boy into Fort Wyvern , the abandoned military base that was the source of many of Moonlight Bay 's current problems . Wyvern , which covers 134,456 acres -- far more territory than our town-is surrounded by a high chain-link fence supported by steel posts sunk in concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier bisected the river , and as I rounded the curve in the channel , I saw a dark-colored Chevrolet Suburban parked in front of it , and at the end of the tracks we had been following . The truck was about sixty feet away , but I was reasonably sure no one was in it . Nevertheless , I intended to approach it with caution . Orson 's low growl indicated a wariness of his own . With Orson at my side , I approached the Suburban . No driver or passenger waited inside . The hood was still warm with engine heat ; the truck had been parked here only minutes . Footprints led from the driver 's door around to the front door on the passenger 's side . From there , they continued toward the nearby fence . They appeared to be similar -- if not identical -- to the prints in the planting bed under Jimmy Wing 's bedroom window . The silver-coin moon was rolling slowly toward the dark purse of the western horizon , but its glow remained bright enough to allow me to read the license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorized the number . I found where a bolt cutter had been used to breach the chain-link fence . Evidently , this was accomplished some time ago , before the most recent rain , because the water-smoothed silt was not heavily disturbed , as it would have been by someone doing all that work . Several culverts also link Moonlight Bay to Wyvern . Usually , when I explore the former army base , I enter by one of those more discreet passages , where I have used my own bolt cutter . On this river-spanning fence -- as elsewhere along the entire perimeter and throughout the sprawling grounds of Wyvern -- a sign with red and black lettering warned that although this facility had been shut down at the recommendation of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission , as a consequence of the end of the Cold War , trespassers would nevertheless be prosecuted , fined , and possibly imprisoned under a list of relevant federal statutes so long that it occupied the bottom third of the notice .

The gloom prevented me from positively identifying the new impressions . I risked using the flashlight . Hooding it with one hand , I flicked it on for only a second or two , which was long enough for me to figure out what had happened here . Although the breach in the fence apparently had been made well ahead of time , in preparation for the crime , the kidnapper had not left a gaping hole . He 'd created a less obvious pass-through , and tonight he had needed only to pull the loosely hanging flap of chain-link out of his way . To free both hands for this task , he had put down his captive , ensuring against an escape attempt either by paralyzing Jimmy with vicious threats or by tethering the boy .

As strong as Lilly was , she might be broken if she had to suffer this second and even more terrible loss so soon after the first . Although she and I had long ago ceased to be lovers , I still loved her as a friend . I prayed that I 'd be able to bring her son back to her , smiling and unharmed , and see the anguish vanish from her face . Orson 's whine was filled with worry . He was quivering , eager to give pursuit . After tucking the small flashlight under my belt once more , I peeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest sang through the steel links .
