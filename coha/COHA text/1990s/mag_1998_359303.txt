David P. Schippers , the lawyer hired by the house to help lead possible impeachment hearings against the President , is a lifelong Democrat who voted for Clinton twice . That 's not the only surprising thing about his appointment as lead counsel by Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde . Schippers , a widely respected criminal-defense attorney and former federal prosecutor , has had practically nothing to do with national politics in his four-decade career . He once said he counts Thomas Jefferson among his heroes because " he never wanted to be in politics . " <P> This is also a man who wrote a fan letter to a hostile witness because he knew the witness was telling the truth . Schippers says he 's the kind of lawyer who prefers to " play it according to the rules " rather than bend them to score a point off a legal opponent . By that standard alone , Schippers , 68 , may seem an anomaly within the Beltway . In fact , he came to Washington only in March , having grown up and spent most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a priest and attended Chicago 's Quigley seminary . But he opted for law school ( night classes at Loyola University ) and soon landed a Justice Department job with the Chicago arm of John Kennedy 's Organized Crime Strike Force . That position led to an early brush with history : he was with his boss Robert Kennedy hours before the Attorney General 's brother was shot in Dallas . Schippers ' credentials  --  including nailing reputed mobster Sam Giancana and regularly defending unpopular clients like 1980s porn star Seka  --  have left him with an urge for rigor when it comes to gathering and evaluating evidence . " You ca n't prejudge what you do n't know anything about , " the father of 10 told the Los Angeles Times last month . " That 's one of the things that bothers me about Washington : everybody knows what Mr. Starr has , and really nobody knows what he has . " <P> The ruddy-faced attorney is almost defiantly uncool ( a favorite catchphrase : " What 're the facts , babe ? " ) . And defiant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going for the jugular . " But if he 's prepared to be a tough legal mind , he remains profoundly reticent about the political role he may be asked to play . " Every once in a while it hits you , " Schippers has said . " It really hit me when I took my wife to the Jefferson Memorial . If you stand at Mr. Jefferson 's feet and you look where he 's looking , you see right into the Oval Office . It kind of hit me right then . I thought , ' Oh , God . I pray that it does n't happen . ' " But if it does , Schippers could become as much of a household name as Lewinsky . <P>  --  By Harriet Barovick . Reported by James Carney/Washington
