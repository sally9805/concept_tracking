<p> WASHINGTON - Until James W.O . Rogers , a Colorado real estate agent , opened his mail Jan. 20 , Nicholas J. Bush had led a charmed life in the nation 's capital . <p> A lobbyist for the natural gas industry , Bush was known by both the titans of the petroleum industry and the power brokers on Capitol Hill . He would be summoned to the White House for energy conferences , but was also a man with expensive taste in women , food and drink . <p> When Rogers opened a letter from the Internal Revenue Service that January morning in Colorado Springs , Nick Bush 's world began to crash . <p> The IRS demanded to know why Rogers had failed to report the $ 275,000 he had earned in 1997 from the Natural Gas Supply Association , the industry trade group headed by Bush . Rogers says he had never heard of the group and the letter left him ' amused and shocked . ' <p> Federal prosecutors said that letter , and Rogers ' response to it , led to Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bank accounts to systematically loot money from the NGSA . Over a 16-year period , Bush stole nearly $ 3 million that he lavished on a double life . <p> This morning , Bush faces sentencing on charges of mail fraud and tax evasion . He has pleaded guilty and been warned by U.S. District Judge Emmett G. Sullivan that he will likely be imprisoned . <p> Prosecutors are recommending Bush be sentenced to 33 to 41 months in prison , a sentence Bush maintains is too severe for a crime that left no victims . <p> Bush , who is not related to former President George Bush , financed his double life by creating phony consulting contracts that used Rogers ' name and Social Security number as well as the names of two other men , one of them a former White House chief of staff and the other a top aide to former first lady Nancy Reagan . <p> Bush funneled much of the money into a bank account carrying Rogers ' name . And with it , prosecutors say , the 54-year-old petroleum executive maintained a lavish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in Washington until last year , said he ca n't figure out how Bush got his Social Security number . But he does recall helping Bush about 15 years ago when he needed to break a lease on a home in Georgetown . Rogers used a check to buy some furnishings from Bush and now fears it contained his Social Security number . <p> ' He said he was taking a job in San Francisco and had to leave immediately . He did n't even have time to take care of the furniture he was also leasing . So he asked if I could help him , ' Rogers said . <p> While Bush 's wife lived in a large home in an exclusive Virginia suburb overlooking the Potomac River , he also acquired a second home in an exclusive Washington neighborhood where the former president Bush once lived . <p> Neighbors said he entertained women there . For one , a Canadian diplomat , Bush bought a home on a resort island in Canada . Bush bought her the home after she apparently discovered the scheme and threatened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a written plea to Sullivan , Rogers says Bush 's stealing was not a victimless crime . <p> ' I am a victim of Mr. Bush 's crimes , just as was the NGSA , ' he said in a Sept. 2 letter . ' From the association Mr. Bush stole money . From me , Mr. Bush stole my good name . ... My name is now tarnished in the eyes of the Internal Revenue Service , ' Rogers said . <p> Rogers said that during the investigation , the IRS , FBI , prosecutors , the NGSA and the media ' all considered me part of Mr. Bush 's scheme , a suspect in the theft of NGSA funds . My name has now been cleared , but I fear my reputation has been sullied . ' <p> Until he got that IRS notice , Rogers had never heard of the NGSA , a trade association composed of petroleum industry giants , among them Amoco , Arco , Chevron and Shell . The idea that he could have forgotten a $ 275,000 payment , an amount ' disproportionate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny . <p> Puzzled , he called the gas association headquarters to complain . There , a bookkeeper named Jodee Jackson took his call . <p> Jackson 's first impulse was to check with Bush . According to court records , Bush told her that ' Rogers was a ' wacko ' who was trying to get him in trouble . ' Troubled , Jackson turned to another worker , who told her to talk to the NGSA 's in-house lawyer , John Sharp . Sharp hired investigators and then notified the FBI . <p> What the NGSA uncovered was what many of the hundreds of trade associations in Washington describe as their worst nightmare : an all-powerful chief executive whose personal actions can destroy their organization 's reputation and undermine its effectiveness with Congress . NGSA employees said in court papers that they and their organization are still attempting to recover from the damage Bush did . <p> In a lawsuit filed in D.C. Superior Court , the association has alleged that Bush , a reserved , introspective executive who was being paid more than $ 300,000 a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the checks that the NGSA was paying to the three consultants - Rogers , former White House chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein and James Rosebush , the former chief of staff to Nancy Reagan - and put the money into bank accounts he controlled . <p> Bush had padded his expense accounts to the tune of thousands of dollars , investigators said . <p> How Bush could have created such a scheme , and kept it secret for so long , has baffled those who knew him . <p> ' I was stunned and shocked . I had no inkling I ca n't understand it , ' lobbyist Wayne H. Valis told The Washington Post earlier this year . Valis met Bush when he worked in the White House and has represented NGSA on Capitol Hill for almost 18 years . <p> Bush telephoned Valis shortly before the association placed him on unpaid leave Feb. 16 . ' He called to tell me a lot of bad things were going to be said about him , ' Valis said . <p> Investigators say at one point Bush claimed he stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't buy that and have described Bush as less than candid about where the money went . His homes have been seized , but even when the houses and their furnishings were sold , the government has said it recovered only $ 874,000 , about 30 percent of his theft . <p> It is ' not an extraordinary restitution , ' the prosecutors said . Bush 's wife has sued him for divorce . <p> While it is unclear where all the money went , investigators say Bush began stealing from the association in 1982 soon after he arrived there . He used some of the money to finance the fancy homes he owned . <p> Bush kept the Rogers scheme going for years by telling bookkeepers at the NGSA to give him the paychecks for the alleged consultant . Instead of giving the checks to Rogers , Bush would deposit them to a bank account he had created in Rogers ' name . <p> In 1998 , he slipped up , failing to destroy a Form 1099 the association had drafted for the IRS , reporting to the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When that form arrived at IRS regional headquarters in Philadelphia , it prompted the dunning notice to Rogers . <p> Before he was hired by NGSA in 1982 , Bush was president of Mid-Continent Oil &; Gas Association , a regional petroleum association based in Washington . A brief biography , supplied by the association , said Bush had worked for Ford Motor Co. in Detroit and Cleveland and Exxon Co . USA in Houston and Washington before that . <p> Industry officials say he was regarded as an effective advocate for the natural gas producers . <p> When the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission changed officials , Bush was frequently quoted by The New York Times on the arrivals and departures of new commissioners . When Energy Secretary Federico Pena of Denver left the agency in 1988 , Bush was one of the Washington officials quoted in a Denver Post news story . <p> ' He was politically astute , ' said Charlotte LeGates , Bush 's public relations spokeswoman for six years . ' He came on strong , too strong for some , perhaps , but he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the NGSA lobbyist , said few people in Washington were close to Bush . <p> ' He was almost shy for a trade association guy , ' the lobbyist told The Washington Post . ' People knew him , but they did n't know him . ' <p> Mary Ellen Bork , the wife of former federal judge and Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork , said : ' Of all my neighbors , he was the mystery neighbor . ' <p> Nothing the staff knew about Bush prepared them for what auditors discovered . When the trade group ordered Bush out of his office on Feb. 16 , workers discovered a batch of First Union Bank checks imprinted with Rogers ' name , but listing Bush 's address , 5184 Palisades Lane , N.W. <p> Rogers said he had no idea Bush had allegedly taken more than $ 2.2 million in his name , until a reporter called him . He dismissed the suggestion that he had done something special . <p> ' I blew the whistle in self-defense , ' Rogers said . @p#
