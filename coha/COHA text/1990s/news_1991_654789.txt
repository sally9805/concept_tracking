<p> THERE are not many young women left in Al Ameriyah neighborhood in Baghdad . <p> There is hardly a family that did not lose a mother , a sister , or a daughter the evening of Feb. 12 , when missiles of the United States-led coalition against Iraq hit a public shelter , killing at least 800 people , according to residents . <p> " Most of my school girlfriends were killed . I have very few left , " said 16-year-old Soha . <p> But neither the death toll nor the vast destruction of their capital city seem to have shattered Iraqis the most , residents say . After eight years of war with Iran , Iraqis are used to large numbers of casualties . <p> " The most tragic aspect of this war is that Iraqis see little hope for the future , " said a novelist . <p> A combination of the effects of an international embargo , political isolation , and destruction of the country 's infrastructure convinced many Iraqis that the country has been subjected to " collective punishment " by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief victims in a war launched in the name of international law . <p> " The problem with the US and the West is that they do not deal with people but with individual leaders , without considering the repercussions on the people , " said a university professor . <p> Many Iraqis feel that the real aim of the war was to punish Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for challenging the United States and Western interests . " But before they will be able to destroy Saddam , they have destroyed us , the people , " said an Iraqi woman , echoing widespread sentiments . <p> There are still no reliable estimates of Iraqi civilian casualties during the Gulf war . The Al Ameriyah shelter bombing is believed to be the incident in which the greatest number of civilians were killed . ( US officials insist it was a military bunker . ) <p> Despair over casualties from coalition bombing was further aggravated by the civil war that broke out after an informal cease-fire in the Gulf war . The rebellion in the north and south of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baghdad residents heard that rebels had killed families affiliated with the ruling Baathist Party in Basra , Najaf , and Karbala in the south . Little is known of Army and Republican Guard killings in their drive to end the rebellion . <p> After being convinced that the war was over , the prospect of more destruction - this time , Iraqis killing Iraqis - deepened gloom in the capital city . <p> Protests put down <p> Although anti-Saddam protests took place in Shiite areas of Baghdad in support of the rebellion in the south , they were quickly put down . There is widespread discontent in the capital , but it has yet to take political form ; most residents still seem confused and disoriented . <p> " This is unbelievable - the country is moving from one tragedy into another . I am afraid we shall enter in an endless chain of destruction , just like Lebanon , " said a professional translator . <p> For the last eight months , Iraqis faced an international embargo that reduced their lives to the most basic needs . Then came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country . <p> From the very outset of the bombardment , the coalition forces targeted telecommunications center , power stations , water-purification plants , and the sewage system . The targeted buildings , at least in the Baghdad area , were hit several times until they were beyond repair . After the informal cease-fire , the government began bulldozing the buildings , as repeated hits made it impossible to fix anything . <p> " The destruction has thrown us a century back . It will be worse than starting from point zero , " said an Iraqi architect . <p> For more than five weeks , the country has been plunged into darkness , as main power stations were badly hit . Many Iraqis used kerosene lamps , as in the old days , and candles - mostly bad-quality candles that produced thick , black smoke . <p> Less than a week after the informal cease-fire , however , the government started a limited restoration of electricity to Baghdad , reportedly using an old power station and mobile generator . The impact was tremendous on the spirit of exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope was sparked . The main topic of daily conversation became the areas to which electricity has been restored . <p> Coalition forces insist that the bombardment was aimed at undermining the Iraqi Army , but Iraqis question why water and sewage systems were destroyed . <p> The United Nations and other international relief organizations say the bombings destroyed Iraq 's infrastructure and shut down public services , threatening the outbreak of epidemics . The World Health Organization reported that Iraq 's central water system supplies 5 percent of its prewar capacity of drinkable water . <p> Citizens , who are getting their main supplies from the polluted river of Tigris , are repeatedly asked to boil the tap water . <p> " This is like a slow death , " says one Iraqi housewife . <p> The coalition forces have reportedly destroyed most of the major factories , and many of the smaller ones . The destruction of vital economic sectors has aggravated the impact of international sanctions , threatening soaring rates of unemployment . <p> The hardest hit of the population seems to be the younger people who see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cease-fire , young men crowded sidewalk coffee shops - which reopened , but had very limited menus . Many walk aimlessly through traditional souks . <p> " They have nowhere to go , many have lost their jobs and their future , " said Munir , an electrician . <p> Souk vendors , however , seem flourishing . Al Shourjeh downtown market place was always busy and crowded . All kinds of goods flood the market , but are unlikely to make life easier for most Iraqis , who can not afford the high prices . <p> Iraqis , except for the most affluent , have reduced their intake of meat , bread , rice , tea , and milk . The prices of these staple foods are beyond the reach of many . Tea , a staple in Iraq especially during the month of Ramadan , sells for more than $60 a pound . <p> Severe shortages of fuel remain , despite the resumption of gasoline sales . Iraqi citizens are entitled to five gallons every three weeks , as 80 percent of Iraq 's refinery system has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Army vehicles , also is available on the black market . <p> City of pedestrians <p> The Iraqis have found the fuel shortages particularly unacceptable . " This is incredible . We are an oil-producing country , " said a taxi driver . The city 's vast number of white and red cabs are rarely seen on the streets now . In the past many , Iraqis supplemented their limited salaries or avoided unemployment by working as taxi drivers . Although the traffic on the capital 's streets was slowly picking up , Baghdad has become a city of pedestrians and bicyclists . <p> International relief organizations have warned that , without fuel , the mission of rebuilding Iraq is impossible and that it will difficult to operate hospitals or to set up water purification plants . <p> The lack of telephone communications and the shortage of fuel has severed contacts in the city of 4 million . <p> Relief , workers , journalists , and medical volunteers coming from Jordan find themselves traveling long distances carrying and distributing letters from Iraqi expatriates who have been worried about the fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mostly from Jordan , carry gallons of their fuel to supply Iraqi friends . Vans loaded with food supplies and medicine , mostly by Jordanian and international relief organizations , are almost the only vehicles seen traveling to Baghdad along the badly damaged highway . <p> When this reporter returned to Baghdad , three weeks after the war , there were many charred vehicles on the highway , mostly civilian with Jordanian license plates . They had been targeted during continuous air raids by the coalition forces . <p> In Baghdad , communications were rendered more difficult after the destruction of two beautiful , historic bridges . The collapse of the bridges deeply troubled residents who are proud of their city 's history . <p> " I just can not get myself near the bridges . I break in tears just by observing the view from afar . I can not see the beautiful city destroyed , " said an Iraqi poet who is in his 70s . <p> During the heavy days and nights of the bombardment by coalition forces , there were days Baghdad was shrouded with fog-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but remains heavy . <p> " They have confiscated everything , the country 's infrastructure , our dreams , and even the oxygen , " said the poet . " But we should remain hopeful . It is not the first time that Baghdad was destroyed and it was always rebuilt to assume its place in the world civilization . "
