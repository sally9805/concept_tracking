<p> As Mexicans prepare to elect a new government tomorrow , election observer groups say the voting process remains sullied by irregularities , halfhearted reforms and harassment of observers by government officials . <p> Although all observers say the voting will probably be the cleanest in the nation 's fraud-stained history , they warn that the remaining problems bode ill for a process that many opposition party supporters believe will be fraudulent . <p> On the surface , the results appear to be cut and dried . Ernesto Zedillo , the presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , holds a large lead in most polls over his challengers , conservative contender Diego Fernandez and the left-of-center Cuauhtemoc Cardenas . The government points to an extensive series of electoral reforms this year , including a $ 730 million voter list and a high-tech voter identification card , as evidence that this year 's voting will be exemplary . <p> For the first time , the voting will take place under the scrutiny of tens of thousands of observers searching for fraud . An estimated 32,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. and other foreign observers . <p> But in a report released yesterday , Mexico 's leading observer group concluded that although a free vote is possible , the government has failed to enforce the new reforms . <p> " The conditions that would allow the 1994 election process to be considered equitable and fair are not present , " said Civic Alliance , a U.N.- and U.S.-financed group that has monitored the entire electoral process and is stationing more than 12,000 observers at polling booths nationwide . <p> The report documented the following abuses : <p> * Widespread coercion of voters by government and PRI officials . In most cases , workers were threatened with the loss of several days ' pay if they did not support PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo . For example , on August 12 , the leader of the PRI-affiliated Mexico City bakers ' union sent all his members a printed statement ordering them to attend a Sunday rally by Zedillo . Attendance was " obligatory , " the statement said twice , warning that those who did not attend would " receive the usual sanctions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegations . On Thursday night , Mexico City police tried to break up a rock concert that Civic Alliance was throwing for its own volunteer observers . The police backed off only after the alliance protested to federal electoral authorities . And Wednesday , police in Michoacan state occupied and searched the office of a Civic Alliance affiliate . <p> * Direct government help to the PRI campaign . In the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz , observers produced a tape-recording of telephone conversations appearing to show the use of the PRI governor 's helicopter and other state resources by Zedillo 's campaign . <p> In addition , the report said that recent areas of progress  --  such as government reform of the Federal Electoral Institute and pressure on PRI-linked television giant Televisa to moderate its heavy pro-PRI bias  --  have turned out to have made " a disappointingly low level of progress . " <p> Foreign observers have also been critical . The Atlanta-based Carter Center , directed by former President Jimmy Carter , said in a recent report that the government has failed to correct " an uneven playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete equitably . " <p> The Carter Center , which has a 20-member group observing the election , also said the last-minute June reforms of the electoral institute " leave insufficient time for the ( institute 's ) new General Council to exercise control over the electoral machinery at the state and district levels and to ensure equitable conditions for a free election . " <p> The voting list , which has been praised as accurate by the United Nations but criticized as unreliable by the opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party ( PRD ) , got a mixed reaction . <p> Earlier this week , U.S. observer groups went door to door in one Mexico City neighborhood . In one block , they found 12 " phantom " registered voters  --  who were either dead or had never existed . <p> " The problem is this sort of thing makes people cynical here , " said Medea Benjamin , director of the San Francisco-based Global Exchange , which brought 115 Americans in as election observers . She said she has observed elections in several nations , including El Salvador and South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electoral process as in Mexico . <p> Civic Alliance said its spot checks of the list showed that between 3 percent and 6 percent of the names listed were phantoms , a rate that it called high but nevertheless acceptable . <p> The common denominator in the election process appears to be distrust . A recent Civic Alliance survey of 4,790 Mexicans in 16 states found that 63 percent of those interviewed believe ballots will be altered , ignored or switched by the computer system . <p> " The degree of suspicion and expectation of fraud here is much greater than I 've seen elsewhere , " said Horacio Boneo , director of the U.N . electoral advisory group . " This makes evaluating the situation much more complicated . " <p> Foreign observers are officially considered " visitors " and do not receive full access to voting facilities . Carter Center delegation head Jennifer McCoy said her team , including former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Jim Wright and former President Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala , was hampered by a delay in receiving the invitation . <p> " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , " she said . <p> Tempers have frayed . This week , after Boneo released a U.N . report saying the voter list was reliable , Civic Alliance director Sergio Aguayo in a column in the daily La Jornada , said the report was full of " optimism that is limitless and well-intentioned but without foundation .
