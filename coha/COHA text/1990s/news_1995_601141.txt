<p> Armor and amour . Damsels and dragons . Kilts and kingdoms . <p> A new era of big-screen swashbucklers dawns with today 's unsheathing of Rob Roy , the story of an 18th-century Scottish clan leader who fights to uphold his honor as he slices up his foes like so much shortbread . <p> Liam Neeson , Roy 's mighty man in plaid , is n't the only leading actor trying to be in like ( Errol ) Flynn . Mel Gibson directs and stars as the 13th-century Scottish patriot William Wallace in Braveheart , due May 24 ; Sean Connery wears the crown and revives the Arthurian legend with Richard Gere as a dashing Lancelot in First Knight , out July 7 ; and Dennis Quaid is a 10th-century dragon slayer and Connery the voice of a computer-graphics dragon in Dragonheart , coming in 1996 . <p> The competition is almost as fierce as the movie action . <p> " This script went flying past and I fell in love , " says Gibson , speaking from London , where he 's finalizing his kilt-and-kill-'em adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " When it was announced in the trades that I was doing Braveheart , I got the script for Rob Roy the next day . And I got First Knight , too . " What , they did n't offer Dragonheart ? " Oh , yes , they did . " <p> Why pick Braveheart ? " It was the best . I sound like a cocky bastard , " he says , chuckling before adding , " but I am . " <p> Aye , spoken with true swash . <p> " I felt I should hurry up and come out before the rest , " says Roy director Michael Caton-Jones , whose film was originally scheduled for July . " It was important that I was n't judged by the others . I saw what happened to Wyatt Earp after Tombstone and Valmont after Dangerous Liaisons . And I said to myself , ' Get going , Michael . ' We moved like the wind . " <p> Economy was in his favor . Roy , at $ 25 million , cost about half of the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew , who were filming nearby ( " I was nipping at his heels , " jokes Gibson , who used locations in Ireland as well ) . <p> " I knew my country and knew where to shoot . I saved money all over . With fewer people , you move quicker - like the Highlanders . " <p> Just as a posse of Westerns galloped into theaters in the wake of Oscar winners Dances With Wolves and Unforgiven , these dueling period pieces seem to be playing catch-up with the sweeping success of Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves ( 1991 ) and The Last of the Mohicans ( 1992 ) . <p> " This happens all the time , " says First Knight director Jerry Zucker , who began his project three years ago and filmed in England . " Once somebody is working on something , it 's in the air . When I did Ghost , there were several other similar ' ghost ' films like Ghost Dad and Truly Madly Deeply . " <p> " But , " he 's quick to add , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's very much a legend , not a true story . Medieval , but not presented with gritty , sweaty realism . The center is a woman ( Julia Ormond as Guinevere ) caught between two men . " The script dispenses with Merlin and any source of sorcery usually associated with Camelot . " We focus on the drama of people 's lives . " <p> Director Rob Cohen ( Dragon : The Bruce Lee Story ) is busy overseeing the computerized additions to Dragonheart , which was shot in Slovakia and promises to do to those scaly mythical fire-breathers what Jurassic Park did for dinos . The majestic Draco is 18 feet high , 43 feet long and has a wingspan of more than 72 feet - bigger than T-Rex . <p> Cohen , who calls his film " an allegorical fable , a love story between Dennis and the dragon , " is glad to be coming out last , " away from the pack . I just hope audiences are n't exhausted by then . " <p> The genre provides " a very transporting moviegoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby or the mad bomber holding hostages in a building , " Cohen says . " It 's about another time . And earlier times had clearer moral codes that were n't as murky or scary as our future of info highways and fiber optics . We knew what knights of old stood for . " <p> Cohen , whose tale holds the most kid appeal , loved The Adventures of Robin Hood and Captain Blood ( which Warner Bros. plans to remake ) as a youngster . " Flynn never worried . He would just walk into an enemy 's camp with a deer slung over his shoulder and dump it on the table with 55 guys ready to skewer him . And he 'd just whip out a rapier and swing on chandeliers . That suspension of anxiety was very appealing to me . I was always worried about getting an A on my English term paper . " <p> Perhaps happiest about the swashbuckler 's return are sword masters like England 's Robert Anderson , who trained Gere for First Knight . <p> " The ultimate weapon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's much more difficult to face someone a few feet away with a sword than 30 feet away with a gun . That 's detached . But there 's no detachment when a sword cuts your head or runs you through . " <p> The former Olympic fencer , 72 , also worked with Flynn in such later costume yarns as 1953 's The Master of Ballantrae . " In the old days , they would use a double for the actor during the serious swordfighting . Today , so many top actors like Richard are prepared to do it all themselves and are proud to do it . " <p> Caton-Jones , working on a smaller scale , compares Roy to a Western . " It involves people living off the land on the frontier . I tried to make it an intimate romantic epic , " referring to scenes of conjugal wooing between Neeson and Jessica Lange ( " Do you want to make a silk purse out of my sow 's ear ? " she purrs earthily ) . <p> Derring-do as daring does , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't jostle a jaded audience these days just with jousting . For one , Braveheart 's cruder style of fighting is far more brutal . " Wallace would charge into a crowd of guys , swinging his claymore like a helicopter blade with bits and pieces flying , " Gibson says . <p> " I wanted audiences to feel as if they were in the middle of it , to smell the battle . Science today uses buttons in a room that can fry people in another country . That 's the state of weaponry today . In the good old days , they would go out and find a man and go one-on-one . " <p> Furthermore , Scottish warriors in the more primal Middle Ages " would usually take their kilts off , paint themselves blue and go into battle naked . " <p> That 's not exactly re-created in his nearly three-hour , violence-studded epic , though the actor does don war paint . <p> But Gibson , who found inspiration by watching a homemade " carnage " video featuring famous on-screen clashes from Spartacus , Ran , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manages a show-stopper for the mid-movie Battle of Stirling . <p> " Scots often would flash the other side , " says Gibson with an audible Aussie wink . " I have 1,000 guys ( extras from the Irish Reserve Army ) exposing their equipment all at once . And their backsides as well . It 'll go into the Guinness Book of Records as the most asses ever on screen . " <p> Now that 's making a real spectacle of yourself .
