<p> It 's not your imagination : There really is a conspiracy . Thousands of people are spending hundreds of millions of dollars in a relentless effort , intensified at this time of year , to compel you to buy the juice . <p> Which is what people in the business privately call the product . " A really great juice , " they 'll say admiringly . Or : " Packaging 's important , but you got ta have the juice . " But in public , where " juice " sounds unfashionable and " perfume " is too limited and " smelly liquid in a fancy bottle " lacks panache , they call the stuff " fragrance . " <p> It 's an imaginative bunch , the fragrance cabal . As the number of new scents sprung on the public keeps growing  --  65 for women this year , 26 for men  --  so does the challenge of making the juice in one bottle seem more desirable and exciting , more worth 40 bucks for 1.7 ounces , than the juice in another . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have learned to associate fragrances not only with snobby jewelry stores ( Tiffany , Van Cleef ) , with upscale resorts ( Aspen , Tahoe , Santa Fe ) and with every fashion designer who ever sketched a schmatta . They 've also learned to hitch them to great art ( Les Fleurs de Claude Monet ) and to not-great art ( Only , by Julio Iglesias ) and to life itself ( DNA , an eau de toilette in a helix-shaped bottle by Bijan ) . Revlon sells fragrances named for characters from defunct TV melodramas ( Forever Krystle ) and for jeans ( Guess ) and , new this year , for lipstick colors ( Fire &; Ice ) . <p> Do not think that you can escape the mania in the supposedly sensible environs of a store like Eddie Bauer . It 's selling a cologne called Adventurer . ( There 's a mallard on the bottle . ) The Gap 's trying out its new GapScents line ( four smells  --  dubbed grass , day , heaven and earth  --  in recyclable containers ) in 52 stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duck Shoe and Damp Retriever  --  no , that was a joke . Bean remains fragrance-free . For now . <p> Even more than the fashion and cosmetics businesses with which it is allied , the fragrance trade traffics almost entirely in imagery and hyperbole . Its product , after all , serves no verifiable purpose . " It 's totally psychological , " acknowledges Annette Green , president of the Fragrance Foundation ( the trade association that each year distributes awards called the FiFis , but let that pass ) . " It does n't make you richer , thinner , younger . ... Unlike makeup or clothing that covers up certain things , it 's unseen . " <p> Yet somehow , the proselyting induces Americans to keep buying , to spend more than $ 5 billion at retail this year , most of it in these few pre-Christmas weeks . " Wise men , " the folks at Estee Lauder assert shamelessly , " give White Linen . " They 're not talking about the Magi . <p> ' Hint of Peach Flesh ' <p> Perfumers talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know what Gio , successfully launched last year by Giorgio Armani , smells like ? " Pure roseate notes , accompanied by green notes , combine their aqueous freshness with the true fragrance of hyacinth , " according to the indispensable 1995 Fragrance Foundation Reference Guide , relied on for most of the descriptions quoted herein . It goes on to discuss at length Gio 's orange blossoms , gardenias and " hint of peach flesh . " <p> The people who do understand are the industry 's " noses , " consultants who help mesh smells with marketing positions . Ann Gottlieb , the veteran nose behind Calvin Klein 's CK One ( this year 's major splash ) , explains that in a good juice , the elements fire off at different times . The so-called topnotes are light scents , like citrus or lily of the valley , that " come up and greet your nose , and then they dissipate . They 're volatile . " Middle notes , like jasmine or spices , are warmer , longer-lasting . What 's called the drydown  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lingers . <p> Gottlieb admits that outside the industry , none of this nattering registers . " The woman behind the counter can dance on her head about topnotes and midnotes , " she says . " What matters is , does the consumer like the way it smells ? " <p> So far , the consumer definitely likes CK One , a unisex fragrance for the young whose development consumed nearly a year . Early submissions from the essential-oil houses that actually produce the fragrances to designers ' specs were rejected as " too thick and reminiscent of traditional men 's fragrances , " Gottlieb reports . On the other hand , " if it skewed at all feminine , men would n't buy it . " <p> But the Klein team finally found something sufficiently androgynous ( in addition to " citrusy-fruity " topnotes , florals and musk , it contains a significant shot of green tea ) . " It 's gentle , it 's casual , it 's very approachable  --  you could practically pour a whole bottle on yourself and sit next to someone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked it too . <p> But of course , coming up with the juice is only the beginning . <p> ' Boy-Grabs-Girl ' <p> They do have a singular sort of eloquence , these fragrance folk . Here 's Marc Rosen , a FiFi-winning packaging designer , on the subject of containers : " The perfume bottle is the silent salesman at the counter . It has to speak to the consumer . " And what would it say , exactly ? " It would say , ' Pick me up , open me , smell me , take me home . ' " <p> Packaging is crucial . Perfectly decent juice has been known to sit on the shelf because of a confusing or pedestrian container . In fact , before Ultima II even began the search for a scent to call Head Over Heels , it had come up with the Vargas-like bottle , featuring an upended pair of pink gams and a undulating skirt . " It 's playful , it 's fun , it 's sexy , " Ultima 's Andrea Robinson declares . Wondered Adweek critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the rest of her body somewhere inside the bottle , drowning in the scent ? " <p> Rosen 's designs for Catalyst for Men , launched last spring , are a different kind of playful . Men 's packages sometimes sport a suggestively elongated look with a knobby top . ( " They deny that it 's phallic-looking but you and I know better , " Annette Green mutters . ) <p> The name Catalyst suggested a chemical reaction and set Rosen musing . " As a young boy the first adult toy I wanted desperately for Christmas was a chemistry set , " he says . The bottles he devised are a grown-up version : test-tube-shaped vials in a chrome lab stand , beakers , even one modeled on the Erlenmeyer flask . " There 's a real tactile response that happens at the counter , " Rosen says proudly . " Men want to own this package . " <p> To lure you to the counter , the scentmongers roll out the advertising , a trickle in the spring  --  to inspire Mother 's Day and Father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Calvin Klein is largely responsible for the flood . When he unveiled Obsession in 1985 , the industry was shocked . Not only were the brand 's TV spots  --  directed in edgy , neurotic black-and-white by Richard Avedon  --  very unlike traditional fragrance ads , but so was Obsession 's launch budget . Estimated by trade publications at $ 17 million , it provided the kind of saturation ad campaign normally waged on behalf of toothpastes or detergents . Obsession 's success upped the ante for everyone ; $ 10 million annual ad budgets have since become commonplace . <p> Many of the TV spots peddling fragrances are profoundly uninteresting , nevertheless : preening beauties , clutching couples , brooding seascapes with harp arpeggios on the soundtracks . Print ads , for their part , tend to feature glowing , gorgeous bottles . ( Except for Coty , the Harlequin of fragrance advertisers . You have to admire layouts of smooching couples with ski slopes in the background and slogans like " When pulses race ... It is n't the altitude . It 's Aspen . " And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surf , him  --  looks and sounds like a romance novel : " Everywhere he goes ... Everything he sees ... Everywhere he looks ... You 're there . Make a Man Remember . " ) <p> They all tend to blur , gripes Robin Burns , president and CEO of Estee Lauder USA . " I 'm so tired , personally , of boy-grabs-girl , girl-grabs-boy , same old story . Or that passionate-hot thing . Or Mystery . ... It gets boring . " <p> Burns 's contribution is a witty 30-second spot for Tuscany per Donna , featuring plenty of good-looking women but only one man , an elderly priest . Shot in the Italian town of Siena to the sound of chiming church bells , the ad  --  by the London office of the Lowe Group  --  shows the women lining up in the piazza waiting for the padre to hear confession . He arrives , unlocks the heavy old church door , stops , sniffs . " Tuscany per Donna ? " he asks . " Si , si , " the women chorus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The psychosexual assumptions wo n't withstand serious analysis , but the ads do stand out amid the mush . <p> All these elements  --  the juice , the packaging , the advertising  --  are supposed to reinforce one another in a seamless effusion of merchandising . The name White Diamonds , for instance , meshes perfectly with the icon of bejeweled Elizabeth Taylor , whose photos adorn the print ads , and with the glittery rhinestone bow atop the bottle . " It 's glitzy , a little cheap  --  but it 's right for a commercial scent by Elizabeth Taylor , who is known for her love of diamonds and for her excesses , " says Marc Rosen , who did n't design the bottle but appreciates a professional job when he sees one . <p> This year 's model may be Jean-Paul Gaultier 's eponymous parfum - in- a- can . Paris 's prince of punk , costumier to the Material Girl , Gaultier put his " floral oriental with musky tones " into a torso-shaped bottle  --  it would suggest the Venus de Milo if she 'd been into pink corsets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad is a cross between a music video and a Fellini film : women in aluminum bustiers offer breathy inanities in French and English , dinner forks curl , a silver-haired grande dame morphs into Jean-Paul . Appropriately , it 's aired on MTV , other cable channels and during the Letterman show . " The whole thing  --  the body , the bottle , the fragrance  --  is terrific : It 's a hit , " Annette Green declares . <p> She and her minions have even managed to convince women , once accustomed to sticking with a single " signature " scent , that they now need a " wardrobe of fragrances " for work , for evening , for leisure weekends . Such tactics often prove unnervingly effective , so it is a relief to realize that sometimes they do n't . <p> ' To Smell Like Cher ' <p> Take the minefield of celebrity fragrances . License a name , use the notable 's photo in the advertising and make a bundle , right ? It 's not always so simple . <p> Baryshnikov Pour Homme ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amber notes " ) sells well . But the women 's scent called Misha faltered : Outside certain Zip codes , consumers did n't grasp that Misha is dance legend Mikhail Baryshnikov 's nickname . The new scent , coming this spring , will therefore deliberately be named Baryshnikov Pour Femme . <p> If the " Dynasty " - inspired Forever Krystle ( " delicately embroidered with animal-like notes " ) has remained on the market for a decade , why did Joan Collins 's scent Spectacular bomb ? " Was n't a very elegant bottle , " Green guesses . " A little schmaltzy . " <p> What about the fragrance called Deneuve ? The juice may have been too light for the musky ' 80s , though it could succeed today . And Sophia ? Despite the appeal of La Loren , upscale consumers deserted when the stuff found its way into mass-distribution channels like drugstores . Cher 's Uninhibited ? Another dud . " As it turns out , people did n't necessarily want to smell like Cher , " Green says . " They do want to smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the industry from feverishly trying new maneuvers , however . Perfumers are formulating lighter scents , on the theory that working women other than Demi Moore hesitate to wear heavy perfume to the office . The success of CK One will undoubtedly inspire a number of " shared " fragrances . And every third juice introduced this year incorporates vanilla . <p> Can chocolate be far behind ? No , says nose Gottlieb . Thierry Mugler is trying it already . Caramel is under consideration . " There 's a fascination with things that are edible , " Gottlieb reports . <p> So Martha Stewart is about to uncork an intoxicating scent called Pot Roast  --  no , that was a joke . Fragrances do n't generate fantasies about church suppers . For now . <p> CAPTION : Jean-Paul Gaultier 's bustiered perfume in a can boasts " musky tones . " <p> CAPTION : Calvin Klein 's unisex fragrance CK One . <p> CAPTION : Elizabeth Taylor 's White Diamonds is a gem , sales-wise . <p> CAPTION:Head Over Heels , a fragrance to fit the bottle . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the elements  --  the juice , the packaging , the advertising  --  are supposed to reinforce one another in a seamless effusion of merchandising.
