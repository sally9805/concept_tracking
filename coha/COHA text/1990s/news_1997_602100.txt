<p> WASHINGTON  --  When R.J. Reynolds lawyer D. Scott Wise sat down to testify before a congressional panel earlier this month , Sen. Edward Kennedy puffed himself up to red-faced indignation . <p> " You have n't got much credibility coming in here , " the Massachusetts Democrat fumed , serving notice that anything the tobacco industry favors is going to be viewed suspiciously by many lawmakers . <p> Kennedy 's outburst was another sign that a proposed $ 368.5 billion settlement of states ' lawsuits against tobacco companies , a settlement reached after six months of tortuous negotiations , is falling apart inside the Beltway . <p> And if that deal unravels , it could be back to square one for the tobacco industry and its opponents . That would mean lawsuits that could drag on for years in many states across the nation . <p> It would also mean a lot of blown expectations . When they announced the deal in June , negotiators expressed optimism that the deal would receive congressional approval and President Clinton 's signature this fall . <p> But less than three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps beyond , demonstrating just how hard it is to get something so complex done in Washington . <p> " We could decide we do n't want to do anything . Not passing legislation is one option , " says Sen. Don Nickles , R-Okla. , who will direct the Senate 's consideration of the tobacco settlement . " Some people assume that if this is altered here or there , we 've got a deal . That 's not so . " <p> The state officials and tobacco industry representatives who announced the pact with much fanfare in June underestimated the difficulty of getting the necessary approvals in Washington . In the past 10 weeks , the pact has been picked apart by interest groups , White House advisers and lawmakers on Capitol Hill , where anti-tobacco sentiment is rising . <p> President Clinton is this week expected to outline in very broad terms what he thinks of the deal and the changes he 'd like to see . He says he 'll " do whatever I think will best further public health and will best increase the chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> It 's highly unlikely Clinton will give a strong endorsement . But even if he does , it might not be enough to breathe new life into the settlement . <p> " This is probably the most complex piece of legislation to come along in recent memory , " says Rutgers University political scientist Ross Baker . " The idea that the settlement can kind of sail through Congress is naive , at best . " <p> The deal would require tobacco companies to pay states $ 368.5 billion over 25 years to cover Medicaid costs of treating smoking-related illness . The companies also would submit to tougher advertising and sales restrictions . In return , the states would drop their lawsuits and more than a dozen class-action cases would be settled . And , most important for the companies , there would be a cap on how much each firm would have to pay out in damages each year if any anti-tobacco lawsuits are successful , as well as a ban on future class-action lawsuits . <p> From the states ' perspective , the deal would provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' perspective , the settlement would remove the uncertainty of fighting the lawsuits state-by-state . The companies could win many of those suits , but they carry the potential for penalties to soar through the roof . <p> Amid much hoopla , the June 20 pact was hailed as the greatest victory for anti-smoking forces since the surgeon general 's warnings were posted on cigarette packs in 1965 . <p> Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore , the lead negotiator for the states , called the settlement " the most historic public health achievement in history . " A jubilant Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth boasted that " the Marlboro Man will be riding into the sunset on Joe Camel . " <p> The ink on the proposed settlement had barely dried when the attacks began . Public health advocates such as former surgeon general C. Everett Koop and former Food and Drug Administration chief David Kessler said the pact was too easy on the cigarette makers . <p> The American Lung Association , a key leader in the anti-smoking fight , denounced the pact as " a sweet deal for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Then came the tobacco farmers , who fear economic losses as smoking declines , and the convenience stores , which fear sales losses as cigarette advertising is restricted . Advertising agencies do n't like restrictions on billboards . And the auto-racing industry is concerned about the loss of a major sponsor . <p> In short , the pact affects dozens of interest groups , most of which employ lobbyists seeking to get the best deal they can for their clients . Lobbyists for the tobacco industry alone collected $ 8 million in fees the first six months of this year . <p> Money is no small part of the story about why the settlement is so tenuous . There 's a lot at stake . The tobacco industry takes in about $ 8.4 billion annually in profits before taxes and provides an annual income of $ 2.8 billion for 100,000 farmers in 16 states . What 's more , federal , state and local government take in about $ 15 billion in taxes a year from tobacco products . <p> As all the competing forces have fought for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement has dragged on longer than expected . The review has been led by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala , an ex-smoker who is deeply suspicious of the tobacco companies and would like to punish them , and Clinton domestic policy chief Bruce Reed . He 's a non-smoker who approaches the subject with a more detached , policy-oriented perspective . <p> After getting his advisers ' conflicting recommendations , Clinton is expected to come out this week in favor of a settlement . But he 's expected to condition his approval on certain changes being incorporated . <p> Learning from his ill-fated health care reform plan , the president is expected to outline major principles , rather than try to write the legislation himself . And mindful of maintaining his high approval ratings , he knows that talking tough on tobacco plays well with most voters . Clinton is expected to call for these changes in the agreement : <p>  --  More power for the Food and Drug Administration to regulate nicotine and stiffer fines if teen smoking does n't drop . <p>  --  Greater disclosure of industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Repeal of a $ 50 billion tax credit for the tobacco industry that was inserted into the recently enacted tax law . ( The Senate voted for such a repeal last week , and on Sunday House Speaker Newt Gingrich said he will urge House members to also vote for repeal . ) <p>  --  Some type of financial protection for tobacco farmers . <p> Moore has been working with the White House in an effort to ensure that Clinton 's proposals are n't so tough that the companies walk away . " We want Congress to pass a national tobacco policy . We want to get it right but we do n't want to let the perfect become the enemy of good enough , " he says . <p> On Capitol Hill , however , one can almost hear the scrape of the legislative brakes being applied . " I do n't think any of us knows for sure where we 'll end up , " says Sen. Jim Jeffords , R-Vt. , chairman of the Senate labor committee . <p> Because no members of Congress were at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been somewhat of an orphan on Capitol Hill . Kennedy and other anti-smoking lawmakers have done little but trash it . And those who generally favor the tobacco companies , and receive big financial contributions from them , are reluctant to step forward to embrace it . Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole , during a 1996 campaign swing through Kentucky , caught flak when he said he did n't know if smoking is addictive and added that " some people say milk is addictive . " <p> " Many Republicans saw the way Dole mishandled the smoking issue in last year 's presidential election and do n't want to be seen as defenders of big tobacco , " says William Kristol , a GOP strategist and editor of the conservative Weekly Standard . <p> The tobacco industry continues , however , to use political contributions to bolster its sagging support on Capitol Hill . Common Cause says that the first six months of this year the tobacco industry gave $ 1.6 million to the Republican Party and $ 324,000 to Democrats . <p> The tobacco companies say that any attempt by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion price tag will be a deal-breaker . They recoil at a bill in Congress that would prevent the companies from taking tax deductions for the $ 368.5 billion in payments , raising the effective cost of the settlement by some $ 100 billion . <p> " Who 's going to make the payments if we go out of business ? " asks tobacco industry lawyer J. Phil Carlton . " This is a delicately balanced compromise , " says RJR 's Wise . " The companies do not have the ability to do more . " <p> But many on Capitol Hill believe the companies are bluffing . Not only do some lawmakers think the payouts and penalties are too low , they also do n't like the part of the deal that would protect the tobacco companies from future lawsuits , even though that 's a centerpiece of the settlement . <p> If the comprehensive settlement ultimately falls apart , the fight against smoking and the tobacco companies is certain to continue . <p> Clinton could press for greater FDA control over nicotine . New restrictions on advertising and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be levied . And tobacco companies could be expected to fight them through lobbying and court action . <p> In the meantime , lawsuits against tobacco companies on the state level are moving ahead . And if the national settlement grows too costly , the tobacco industry appears ready to take its chances in court , eschewing further state-by-state deals like those reached with Mississippi and Florida . That prospect , says Moore , could be a " double-edged sword . " <p> " States could start winning on their own and say , ' Why should we share the payments with other states ? ' " Moore says . " Or the companies can start winning and say , ' Wait just a minute on this settlement . ' This settlement is the best deal we can get . The time for Congress to act is now .
