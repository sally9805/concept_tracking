<p> Come with me to a place you should n't go . <p> Come where the hills roll , the air sweetens at dusk and barefooted girls in starched white caps peek around the back of a farmhouse as you drive up . Their mothers murmur into their ears in a soft , guttural tongue . <p> They are inhabitants of rural southwestern Wisconsin who have given me permission to write about them , but not to tell exactly where they are or who they are . They are Susan , Thomas , Daniel , Esther , Omer , Leora , Rosa and many others  --  men , women and children who form an Amish community in a corner of the world where bands of cornstalks undulate on a slope of curly clover . <p> Come , but in your mind 's eye only . Because these people have asked that we not take pictures of them , their animals or their homes . <p> Daniel , one of their leaders , a wisp-thin , bearded man who tramps out of his field to meet us , explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . <p> There is another reason for this staunch privacy . Many in this group have moved there from Northern Indiana , an area that has been invaded by tourism and commercialism . These Wisconsin Amish do n't want to repeat that experience . <p> But do meet them , because they grow the organic vegetables that in part supply Chicago area Dominick 's , Fresh Fields and Whole Foods stores , as well as at least one restaurant . They want to cultivate a successful livelihood from Wisconsin soil , and they are willing to publicize their home-grown vegetables to the outside world . <p> Daniel elaborates as he stretches his thick fingers etched with black earth : " We do n't make the vegetables . A higher power works through us . You see , we consider ourselves as only stewards of the land . " <p> To communicate with the outside world , last spring the group formed a cooperative for which a **25;363;TOOLONG coined the name Sweet Earth Organic Produce . Renee Randall , the publicist , herself an organic farmer , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amish families , many of whom have broken away from the Northern Indiana Amish within the last seven years . <p> A Sun-Times team could , it was agreed , take photos of the Amish crops  --  the vividly hued eggplants , to <p> all zones <p> matoes , squash , parsley and other vegetables that , on this mid-September day , must be picked before a threatened frost . So , we go from farm to farm , chatting at the edge of the gardens because no one has time to gather with us . <p> I may interview them , it has been agreed , but Daniel repeatedly stresses that what 's important is not that the foods are Amish , but that they are organic . <p> " Black and white , if it 's words on paper , that 's all right , " he says . Yet he asked that I omit the name of the county , the names of the women and children and any reference to what 's Amish . <p> Organic farming , Randall explains , refuses the aid of chemical fertilizers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor . By definition , it 's done on a small scale without heavy machinery . <p> The Amish meet most of the criteria by virtue of their Old World farming practices . In fact , Sweet Earth satisfied the requirements of the Organic Crop Improvement Association , the Midwest 's main organic certifying body , from the outset . Usually farms need three years to " clean up " their procedures before they qualify . <p> Low-tech and labor-intensive , organic farming is well-suited to the simple , close-knit Amish family life . As a result , prices of Amish-produced fruits and vegetables are competitive with produce from commercial farms . On the day of our visit , Omer , his wife , an 11-month-old son , a 4-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son are in the fields . Their 2-year-old is asleep in a nearby horse-drawn cart . Their two older children are at school until afternoon , when they , too , will help . <p> Meanwhile , father and mother , who look to be in their late 30s , and young ones are working their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children deposit the squash in piles that , just before dusk , Omer will cover in hopes that tonight 's predicted frost wo n't be severe enough to break through . <p> As Omer and I chat at the edge of the field , his 4-year-old walks up , her face blurred by the red stain of a bell pepper she is nibbling . <p> We stop at five farms  --  at one to pick up raspberries , at another for mint and at still another for pies . We are gathering the makings for lunch as well as the vegetables for the photograph on the front page of this story . At each family 's homestead , the farmhouse , unconnected to the rest of the world by power or telephone lines , is within 20 steps of their gardens . What the farm families raise for sale is what they eat . <p> Randall asks Susan for " some of the chocolate mint . " " It 's just mint , " Susan confides . " She ( Randall ) just made up the fancy name . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not shy inhabitants of some hideaway Brigadoon , but hard-working and determinedly private people . Explain  --  do n't expose  --  us , they ask , and you begin to understand . Preserve them and you preserve the ecological chain that begins with the sacred raising of food . <p> The second-to-the-last stop is lunch at Daniel and Esther 's . Esther has prepared baked delicata squash , roasted new potatoes , an " end-of-the-garden " salad , whole-wheat bread , honey and an 8-inch plate of meat that tastes like Swiss steak , with gravy . Dessert is the pies and raspberries we had gathered at earlier stops . The meal begins with a silent blessing and ends with one . <p> We feast on the simple , practical food , which tastes , in the warmth of the naturally lit house , exactly as you 'd expect  --  like home , the way it should be . It 's no more complex than the ingredients and equipment used to make it : salt , pepper , flour , water and a propane stove . <p> Yet it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparent , the cream fragrant  --  all meant to satisfy real hunger . The children come back silently , holding up bowls to their mother for more . Esther , who hesitates when asked what is most healthful to feed her children , says , " You see , they eat everything . " <p> Like the children , we eat seconds , thirds . <p> The last stop is the holding ; ice house for the cooperative 's vegetables . Randall says the group can deliver fresh produce to stores within 24 hours after an order is placed . Still , fruits , roots and leafy greens need immediate storage . <p> Built by the farmers at the bottom of a cool spring , the building uses troughs of flowing water to cool itself . Boxes of potatoes , peppers and tomatoes are stacked in the next room , which is amazingly cool , for the next pickup . <p> In a separate cinder-block space , ice will be saved this winter . The ice will last through the cooling needs of next summer . <p> The work sounds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community of food growers , it is essential because it will preserve their lives , families and beliefs . <p> At his table , Daniel told us that easy farming had crept into Indiana 's Amish community . After all , chemical fertilizer and pesticides are more reliable than organic methods . He and Omer have had to re-teach themselves organic farming and have become conversant with biodiversity , heirloom seeds , ecology and health . Omer says that finally , " I farm the way my grandfather did . " <p> For them , it paved a return to purity . <p> Some truths about eating well and staying healthy are so obvious that they struggle when asked the standard questions . <p> What is a nutritious meal , I ask them . Omer , in the field , cupping his chin in his hand . " For us , because we do n't have ( health ) insurance , to go to a doctor is what we do n't do . We go to a hospital in an emergency . It 's almost a punishment for us to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not eat it . " After a moment of silence , he answers directly , " We eat just what 's in season . It 's plain to see . " <p> At first , Daniel ca n't find the words to answer the question . Finally , he exclaims , " I know what is good nutrition . You have to have good seed , good soil . . . and good management . <p> " And by management , I mean farming .
