TO HEAR U.S. PROSECUTORS TELL IT , the stunts that Japan 's Daiwa Bank used to conceal the nefarious conduct of its Manhattan office might have come from The Sting . The end result , however , was more akin to the farcical Dumb and Dumber . Among the flagrant ruses employed by Daiwa , prosecutors said , was disguising a downtown trading floor as a nondescript storage room during audits by Federal Reserve regulators . But no sooner had the Feds left than the traders reappeared  --  led by Toshihide Iguchi . It was his dual role as chief bond trader and bookkeeper that ultimately brought the bank to grief by enabling him to rack up $1.1 billion in undisclosed losses from 1984 until his scheme came to light this past summer . <P> If the bank 's antics seemed right for a farce , their impact became the stuff of high drama last week when federal regulators gave Daiwa 90 days to pack up and leave the U.S. In a move coordinated with the regulators , a federal grand jury in New York City indicted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a cover-up of Iguchi 's losses . That could lead to $1.3 billion in fines if the bank is convicted . Masahiro Tsuda , general manager of Daiwa 's New York City office , was charged with taking part in a conspiracy with the bank and Iguchi , who last month pleaded guilty to concealing the losses . The moves were the most sweeping ever taken by the U.S. against so formidable a foreign lender . With $390 billion in total assets , Daiwa is the 10th largest bank in Japan and the 13th largest in the world . <P> The bank , which contends that the Osaka home office was unaware of Iguchi 's actions , responded with a mixture of contrition and defiance . Daiwa agreed to leave the 13 states where it has offices , which account for some 15% of the bank 's international assets . But the president of Daiwa , Takashi Kaiho , lashed out at the indictments , calling them " very inappropriate , " and vowed to fight the charges . At the same time , Kaiho said the bank would reappraise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 7,000 employees . <P> " You can not be a global player without a presence in the U.S. , " says James McDermott , president of the consulting firm Keefe , Bruyette &; Woods . He predicts that the bank may soon be acquired by a buyer like Sumitomo , Japan 's second largest bank , which is reportedly close to a deal . <P> In cracking down on the bank , U.S. officials sought to punish Daiwa without worsening Japan 's year-long financial crisis or generating new tensions between the two countries . Just last month the Federal Reserve agreed to help rescue U.S. branches of Japanese banks if a bailout is required . But Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin was furious at Daiwa for waiting six weeks to notify U.S. authorities of Iguchi 's illegal activities ; the trader told the bank about them in a letter in July . Rubin vented some of that ire last month in a 20-minute phone conversation with Japanese Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura , whose ministry had also learned of Iguchi 's crimes but delayed informing Washington . Takemura expressed regret for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. action , the Finance Ministry moved promptly to discipline Daiwa .
