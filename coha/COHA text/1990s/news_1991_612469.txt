<p> A sandbar in the Red River at Shreveport wo n't exactly match up to the beach at Waikiki . <p> Then again , it is possible to find a hotel room in Shreveport that does not require a bank loan to rent . <p> Still , no one ever mistook north Louisiana for Hawaii 's South Shore . <p> To some , it may not seem fair that Georgia Tech ( 7-4 ) is headed for the Aloha Bowl in Honolulu while Georgia ( 7-3 ) will move one time zone west to play in the Poulan Weed Eater Independence Bowl in Shreveport , La . <p> But whatever the result of Saturday 's regular-season finale between the Jackets and Dogs , Tech folks are polishing their sunglasses and making plans to listen to Christmas carols on ukeleles . <p> " Oh , we 'll have the typical Waikiki weather , " gloats Lenny Klompus , the Aloha 's executive vice president . " The trade winds will be blowing and the sun will be shining . " <p> The Bulldogs , meanwhile , are scheduled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game sported last year , when it was 54 degrees and not raining . <p> " The weather is like Georgia weather , " says Preston Friedley , president of the Shreveport-Bossier Convention and Tourist Bureau . " We 've had a 65-degree kickoff and , at the same time , we have had a 30-degree kickoff . That 's a risk you take . " <p> Friedley has a unique perspective . He grew up in Aiea , Hawaii , a Honolulu suburb , and moved from there to Shreveport 20 years ago . " The people of the South and Louisiana are much more hospitable in a traditional way than the people in Hawaii , " he says . <p> But , of course , that 's what he gets paid to say . <p> Bowl trips are the perks associated with a good season . It can be validation . It can be redemption . It can be a chance to get out of town and live it up on somebody else 's money . <p> " Going to a bowl means a lot to us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his team finished 7-4 by beating Ole Miss . " It proves how far we 've come . " <p> Never mind that Mississippi State is headed to the Liberty Bowl in Memphis , a mere three-hour drive from its Starkville campus . It 's still the team 's first bowl game in a decade . <p> It 's funny on what small considerations bowl trips can be judged . <p> " We had Michigan State in one year 1989 against Georgia , " says Dick Stratton , former president of Jacksonville 's Gator Bowl . " It was when that big tackle Tony Mandarich that plays for Green Bay played for them . " <p> The Spartans were housed in seaside splendor at Amelia Island . Stratton asked Mandarich how he liked it . <p> " He did n't , " Stratton recalls . " He said it was too far from Hooters . " <p> The thinking of those who plan the social swirl surrounding each bowl ranges from the Aloha 's **27;335;TOOLONG approach to the Florida Citrus Bowl 's frenetic schedule , which jams in a visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the middle ground by making available activities from deep-sea fishing to golf . Sometimes the requests from teams catch bowl people by surprise . <p> " Last year , Notre Dame wanted to do this thing called Whirly Ball , " says Lisa Franson , Orange Bowl communications director . " It 's playing basketball in bumper cars . I 'd never heard of it . But we rented out a whole place and took the whole team . " <p> While neither the Aloha nor the Independence has the cache or payoff ( $ 650,000 ) of the New Year 's Day bowls , they each have something to offer . <p> The Aloha , however , offers less than it once did . <p> " We used to drag the kids here , there and everywhere , " says Klompus . " All the kids wanted to do was get back to the beach . " <p> At the inaugural game in 1982 , Maryland , then coached by Tech 's Bobby Ross , played Washington . The Aloha crammed the players ' schedules , including a trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We left Waikiki and it was a typical beautiful day at Waikiki , " Klompus says . " It 's about a 45-minute drive to the Polynesian Cultural Center and when we came out of the Pau Tunnel , it was pouring rain . It rained all the way . It poured . We had raincoats and everything for the players when they got off the bus . " <p> At that crucial moment , Boomer Esiason , the Maryland quarterback who now plays for the Cincinnati Bengals , changed forever the way the Aloha entertained the teams . <p> " Esiason came up to me and said , Get me back to Waikiki . Now ! ' " Klompus recalls . " I will never take the teams to the Polynesian Cultural Center again . " <p> At the Independence Bowl , the approach is more traditional . <p> In Shreveport , 10 hours west of Atlanta along I-20 , there is a team awards party , a luncheon with highlight films , a parade through downtown and a pep rally where the Georgia and Arkansas bands will compete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the players and coaches , " says Pat Tiller , the bowl 's executive director . " One of the things they particularly like is that we do n't have a lot of stuffed-shirt events . " <p> One of the less stuffed-shirt ventures is the traditional , though unofficial trip to Cowboys , a Shreveport bar . <p> " They have some kind of incentives for both teams and the players seem to love it , " Tiller said of the event . " It used to do country-and- western but now it 's a disco . The players really like it . " <p> If you do n't like to disco , there is always Shreveport 's American Rose Center , headquarters of the American Rose Society . Unfortunately , the roses quit blooming in November . <p> Or there is Louisiana Downs , the horse track in neighboring Bossier City . Unfortunately , the races stop in October , but during the Independence Bowl the track will be open for off-track betting on races from New Orleans - about a seven-hour drive south .
