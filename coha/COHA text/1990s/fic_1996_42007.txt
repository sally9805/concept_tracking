LAURIE SAYS SHE FOUND ME naked , in the garage , screaming . I was lying beside the garden tools and camping gear , my hands over my head , screaming . She pulled out a dusty sleeping bag to cover my body . <p> I do n't remember much . I remember being out of Fiorinal and looking for something to kill the pain . I thought there might be some aspirin on the workbench , beside the paint thinner and wood chisels . Instead the bottle was full of miscellaneous screws , a collecting habit I 've inherited from my father , who taught me , among other things , to save always what might prove useful . The screws were scattered now across the cement floor , and I remember Laurie calling the hospital , talking to somebody , explaining my family history . I vomited in a bucket full of sawdust , and then in another we used to wash our cars . Because we each loved our work , which also meant we were fairly good at it , we owned a vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck , and Laurie put me into her car ; she ran inside to fetch a pair of jeans , a fresh shirt , while I shivered and wept inside her long , red car with its telephone . <p> The ride to the hospital was swift but nonetheless interminable . Once , Laurie ran a red light , reached for my hand , and said , " Soon , sweetie . We 'll be there soon . " And I remember panicking , amid the pain , now unforgivable , because my health insurance payment was going to be a day late-a delay caused by recent developments involving a fresh policy for a new , improved , and less expensive life . I remembered things that happened to my mother and instructed Laurie to predate the check , as if it really were possible to go back in time . When you feel as if something will never stop , especially a violent and catastrophic pain inside your head , it is possible to lose your senses , and I remember thinking if she had not been there to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Emergency , then perhaps I would have had no need for comfort . The intensity of this need made me dizzy , and I remember rolling down the window , gently , in order to permit escape . <p> First , an IV . The CAT scan , according to the ER intern , revealed no tumors or bleeds . My intern , Dr. Itzpala , wearing freshly laundered scrubs , seemed a pleasant woman . I suspect she was preoccupied with other matters : Would she ever get the day shift ? Had she been consigned to spend the rest of her healthy life near a moderately violent inner city ? The suburbs are a far more comfortable place to practice , a little bit each day , until you learn to get the basic matters of this life right . If you get married , you can be divorced , try again just down the block . I 've built a number of houses for single and affluent parents . I 've built living quarters for nannies or extended relatives not yet diagnosed with inoperable cancer or Alzheimer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then give me a shot , Dr. Itzpala asked me how old I was . <p> " Thirty-one , " I said . " And counting . " <p> She said , beginning , unfathomably , to flirt , " Trouble at work ? The sun 's not even up . " I realized she was a pretty woman-skin , hair , and eyes . A boy 's dream . I imagined someday dating her , sharing a cappuccino across a wooden table , and realized it would be impossible . She was a doctor , paid to care for the sick , entirely compensated elsewhere . <p> I said , " Sure enough . " <p> " Caffeine ? Alcohol ? You 've been drinking ? This is the third time in six months . You seem like a healthy man ? " <p> " Stress , " I said . <p> " Ahh . Stress . " She lifted my wrist , then set it back down , deciding . <p> " I have to catch a plane , " I said , sitting up . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room , brushing aside the curtain , asking how I was . She had been crying and , probably , talking on the telephone to her lover . She kissed me on the forehead , dead center , with the intent to cure . <p> My intern wrote a prescription . The morphine hit suddenly , a wave designed to capsize , and I fell back onto the table . Dr. Itzpala turned to Laurie and said , pleasantly , that I 'd need more tests . She asked Laurie if she could sign some forms . I closed my eyes and slept , deeply , with my wife watching over me , holding my hand . <p> When I was nine my mother died of brain cancer . It sounds ridiculous , cancer of the brain , like what you might say as a kid about somebody stupid , so and so 's retarded , or got cancer of the brain , but if you had seen my mother lying on the couch with cancer of the brain , you would have been filled with a legitimate terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she fingered her scarf , and you would have seen her eyes , which were blue , and her long , slender fingers-the nails bitten to the quick . You would have seen her holding me to her side , whispering stories , one after another in order to distract us from the unutterable truth : she was dying a vicious and insidious death , and she was not yet forty . And when I told my intern , Dr. Itzpala , that I was thirty-one years old , I realized I had become the same age my mother was the year I was conceived . It was the first time I understood that I was going to be required to spend the rest of my life as an adult , and I will tell you the God 's honest truth . It does not bother me that my mother died of cancer , as so many people in this life will ; what bothers me is that I watched it happen , the cancer eating away first her brain and then her mind while I stood by and fed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I watched my father fall apart-a stone wall , absent any mortar , caught by the recurring tremors of a fault line . Now he too was dead , and Laurie and I were flying east to attend his funeral . <p> On the plane I sat drugged and alert , as if embarking into a dream , and fully welcoming the possibilities : such is the virtue of a lingering narcotic . Laurie had packed quickly for us both while I took a shower . There was no cold water , of course . In Phoenix you wait until November for a cool bath . Then I called my foreman with some last-minute details . We were laying a new foundation on Mummy Mountain , and the county surveyors still needed to confirm our specs . Three months from now , the house would be worth over a million and a half and somebody would be mortgaged to the throat , and then we 'd have a small party-beer , hot dogs for the crew , flowers for the girlfriends and wives-in order to start in again . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , I had made a mint , done myself proper , and spent the night in the hospital again because I 'd had another headache . <p> Laurie drank water , which would n't make her sleepy ; she kept her hands folded on her stomach , just above the seatbelt . It had been nearly two years since I 'd had any wine or beer , which I specifically remembered now , being on a plane , and wanted a good deal of each . Strictly reflexive , that instinct . I quit drinking because I was afraid if I did n't then someday I would have to . As for my father , he had driven his boat onto the dock , which ruptured a gasoline tank . The gas had spilled out and been ignited by his cigarette . People saw the explosion across the bay . Nobody bothered to see if he 'd been drunk , which of course he was . My brother , Joel , was flying in from Atlanta , where he managed a Latin American portfolio that had recently lost a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spin , was going to remain volatile for at least another six weeks . <p> " Hey , " he said . " These are dangerous times . " <p> His accent had become increasingly southern . He 'd been at school when Mom died . Choate , from which he went to Princeton , then on to the University of Chicago : he 'd been pedigreed and well-groomed for the purpose of taking excessive risks with other people 's life savings . He had three kids , one of whom he 'd named after me . Two years ago he 'd asked me to recommend an architect . <p> On the phone , Joel said , " You and Laurie still intending to split the farm ? " <p> " Still intending , " I said . <p> " Should 've had some kids , little brother . Collateral . " <p> He was waiting for us at the gate in Newark . Laurie ran ahead , wrapped her arms around his vast girth , equine in scope , and kissed him on the cheek . <p> " Quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airport scotchand-water . " Little brother , you look like hell . " <p> " You get a car ? " <p> " A big one . S'posed to have a loud radio , even . A CD player ! " <p> " I ca n't drive , " I said . <p> " No , " said Laurie , taking my hand . " Of course not . " <p> My father often drove drunk , and he did not approve of music . Over the years he had become a frightened , lonely , increasingly psychotic man . He lived alone on Barnegat Bay with his cigarette boat and two Labradors . Mornings , he 'd walk along the Jersey shore , his dogs following along , playing in the surf . That 's pretty much all I knew about him anymore . Once , he 'd drawn a knife on me , Christmas vacation when I was fifteen ; apparently I 'd said something inappropriate . Occasionally he 'd call me in the middle of the night , rambling . In the car , driving , Joel asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own opinions . He had some new theories , too , about our father-the loneliness , the shame , the genetic contributions of sheer lunacy . Meanwhile I sat in the back , still riding the crest of my Fiorinal , measuring the traffic , which did n't seem all that different from the traffic back in Phoenix : people had accidents most anywhere . Before Laurie fell in love with a man named Hector Lopez , she was angry with me for not wanting to have a child . She was ripe , she said . She was ready to burst . <p> We were sitting on the roof-our own private sundeck-watching the sky . It 's the place where we first celebrated after I decided to go out on my own . Laurie , just home from work , had removed her blouse and bra . She had kicked off her shoes , her feet up on a crate . She put her hand on her belly , turned to me , and said , " Tell me you do n't want to make love to me . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to raise a little bambino . " <p> It was a pretty sight , for a moment a tempting idea . There was a blanket nearby . My wife is , among other things , a gorgeous woman . She likes to camp . She likes to play softball . Mornings , she likes to roll in the proverbial hay . " Ohh , " she 'll say . " Make me late for work . " <p> It 's a good marriage ; I 've always thought so . I said , admiring the fine sky , " I do n't want to be a dad . You know that . " <p> She stood , suddenly angry . She kicked at my chair with her bare feet . " I 'm serious , Neil . We 're running out of time here . I 'm running out of time . " <p> " It flies , I know . People have kids when they 're fifty . " <p> " No , " she said . " No , you do n't know . I want to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not maybe someday . This is serious . I want to have a baby while I 'm still young enough to play with it . " <p> " What ? You gon na quit your job ? You gon na start a day-care ? I 'm not . You want a kid , go volunteer down in Guadeloupe . Pick a dozen . " <p> " Lots of couples figure this out . " <p> " Yeah , and look at their kids . Good , decent kids all shot up with crack and charge cards . Drooling in designer strollers pushed by Guatemalan nannies . So nice , such good people , those kids . " <p> " You 're not even willing to try ? " <p> " No . I 'm not . " <p> " I do n't need your permission , you know . I do n't have to- " <p> " Laurie , you do that-you get yourself pregnant on purpose-I 'll divorce you . " <p> I 'd never spoken like that , but I meant it . It was the last time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gingerly . Sex often made it easier for me to apologize , and though I was willing to apologize for what I 'd said , I was n't about to change what I believed . I spoiled it , too , that night . I kept myself far away from her , even naked , in the center of our bed , and after that argument , after her implicit threat , and with the knowledge of an earlier abortion with a college lover , I was afraid she 'd actually go and do it-allow herself to become pregnant , slip a pill into the toilet one day , then another . So I began to go to bed after she fell asleep . I 'd wake before the first light , get a jump-start on the day . And she began coming home late from her office , smelling all musky and damp , at times oddly euphoric . Sometimes she did n't come home at all , and I 'd go into the study , fall asleep there over blueprints . One night she got drunk and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't mean ours has to be . " Then she threw her glass of wine at me . " Look at you , " she said . " You 're afraid of a little wine . It 's wine , " she screamed . " It 's just white wine ! " <p> A few days later , maybe even a week , I left the site early and drove to her office . It was August , and hot-over 112 deg , the third day running . I 'd thought , lunch , but she was n't in her office , which was halfway up the second-tallest building downtown . I took the elevator to the fern bar on the third floor , and there she was , at a table with a cloth and nice crystal , sitting across from Hector Lopez . I recognized him from a couple of parties for city politicians . He was sensitive-looking and handsome : movie-style , in an expensive suit . The hostess frowned at me-jeans and boots , dusty-and I put my fingers to my lips . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Oh , " she said , professionally . " Would you like to see a menu ? " <p> " Not really . " <p> " Really , " she said . " I think you should at least have a menu . " <p> My wife 's back was to me . I could see her bra strap beneath the fabric of her dress-one she had picked out for me to give her for her birthday . She was holding Hector 's hand beneath the table . I watched him smile , say something , and begin to laugh . He had generous eyes , and I knew then they were lovers . I returned the menu to my good hostess , left the restaurant , and went to my truck , sat there stewing in the heat , which was intolerable . It felt good , suffering like that . I imagined them at the Hyatt , later , making love . I imagined Laurie 's throat , the vein that always begins to throb ; her eyes , blinking like a blind woman 's . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth on her breast , but later , after the thrill of it all . Then I drove to my lawyer 's office . I broke up a meeting , briefly , and told him to begin drawing up the papers . <p> " Jesus , " he said , stepping outside his office . " Not you , too ? " <p> " I just need to get things rolling , " I said . <p> " You OK ? You need a drink ? " <p> " Ed , " I said . " You got business in there . " <p> The hallway was full of plants and refrigerated air ; I was beginning to chill and felt instantly stupid . I realized that while we 'd done an awful lot of business together , had spent weekends camping with our wives along the Mogollon Rim , this guy did n't know me any better than I did him . He 'd made out my wills ; I 'd built an addition to his ex-wife 's home . He 'd set up a trust fund for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay away from variable life . <p> " Well , I could use a drink , " Ed said . " That 's for damn sure . " <p> " Mr. Holland , " said his secretary , a woman old enough to date my father . " Mr. Holland , you just need a good night 's rest . You 're upset , that 's all . " <p> " Laurie , " Ed said . " Laurie-she know about this yet ? " <p> " Of course she does , Ed . How can anybody not ? You think people get divorced by accident ? You think people just wake up and they 're goddamned separated ? You think people just do n't know any better ? " <p> " You 're upset , " Ed said . " You're- " <p> " Call me at work , " I said . " From now on . " <p> " OK . " <p> " Laurie , " I said . " She 'll be needing a good lawyer too . Maybe you could recommend one . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Ah , " Ed said . " Conflict . " <p> We live in a no-fault state . The legal phrase Ed Alexander would use to describe our union was irreparably broken , but a marriage is not a car , or for that matter a board ; an idea can not simply break like that : it first has to be worn out by years of self-reliance and neglect . And it 's not that I did n't want to spend the rest of my life with Laurie-I did , unequivocally . But I did n't want to deny her the possibility of having a family proper . At the time I also wanted to hurt her badly . And Hector Lopez , I eventually realized , was a decent man ; otherwise she never would have been with him . It was n't about me as much as I might have hoped , which of course made me feel even worse . Your wife starts sleeping with the local politicos , and what , you 're going to start taking out the garbage ? You 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> That night I checked into a hotel . I walked down a filthy block , stepped into a liquor store , and bought a fifth of bourbon . I felt criminal , doing that ; I felt the need for explanation , and I tried to make a joke , but the man I was speaking to could n't hear me for all the bulletproof plastic . He slipped my change through the slot and turned to face a television . The bottle felt heavier than I remembered . I went out onto the street , whiskey in hand ; there were Chicanos sitting on the curb , smoking a joint , passing a quart of beer . I went back to my hotel , stripped out of my clothes , took a hot shower , and sat on the bed , watching the news with the sound turned off . There were riots replaying from L.A. , and a man was having his face beaten with a brick . After a while I held the whiskey in my hands . I pictured myself drunk and ridiculous . Mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course is what nearly everybody wants , so long as he does n't have to pay for it . It 's one thing to love your wife , quite another to realize she may be better off without you . Love makes even the pure of heart-or hard of same-complicitous . And so while I took my good and hot self-pitying bath , I did not open that bottle . Instead I drank half a dozen glasses of water , took another scalding shower . Then I stashed the whiskey in a drawer , beside the Gideon Bible , and put on my clothes . I laced my dusty boots and drove home . <p> I drove fast , still needing to feel as if I had direction . Laurie stood in the kitchen , putting pasta in the oven , probably to keep it warm for me . Usually I called if I was late . <p> " Hi , " she said , kissing me . " Where you been , mister ? " <p> I said , " Want to take a ride ? " <p> We went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up the mountain . It was dark by now . Laurie sat with her feet propped on the dash , which was as dusty as the road . The wind blew in her long hair . The neighborhood , expensive and assiduously quiet , rose into the hills . I pulled up beside a backhoe and stepped out . In the starlight you could see our office trailer-Holland Specialty Homes-and Laurie came around the truck . She was in her sandals , and I told her to watch for nails . <p> " In the dark , " she said . " Uh-huh . " <p> I took her by the hand and led her to what would someday be a front door . <p> She said , pretending to knock , " Why do n't you make one of these for us ? " <p> " Taxes . " <p> " Housecleaning , " she said , laughing . She turned and took a breath . " You 're mad at me about that drinking thing . That thing I said that night ? " <p> " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was awful . " <p> " It was true . " <p> We walked through the living room , the den , out toward the pool , which had been dug into the mountain . The house , complete , would comprise over five thousand square feet . I reached down for a level and kneeled to check a sill . <p> " Here , " I said . " Look . " <p> " What ? " <p> I showed her . You could just make out the fluid bubble , resting dead center . The house was going to be OK . " I was afraid , " I said . " I wanted to check it . " <p> " It 's level ? " <p> " It 's level . When it 's off , when the sill is n't level , the house goes up crooked . The joints do n't agree . Nothing trues . " <p> " A house divided can not stand , " Laurie said . <p> " No , " I said . " That 's a myth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She began to cry now . She took my hand , let it go . She stood in front of the pool . There was scrap inside it now-two-by-fours and skids and electrical conduit . We 'd thought about putting one in our own yard . It 's not as if we could n't afford it . <p> " It 's my fault , " she said . " It 's all my fault . " <p> " No , " I said . " It 's nobody 's . " <p> She began to cry harder , punching me . " It 's got to be somebody 's ! " <p> " My dad , " I said . " He used to blame me . Said it was my fault for being born . Then he began to blame himself . He made sure we 'd hate him . He bought a liquor cabinet and sent me off to prep school . " <p> " Jesus , " she said . " So your dad was crazy . So what ? So you wo n't make love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " No , " she said , blinking . " I do n't think so . " <p> " I spoke to Alexander . He 's drawing up the papers . He said he 'd recommend a lawyer . No fault . " <p> She laughed now . She wiped her eyes and laughed really hard . " You , " she said , pointing . " You 're a pillar , you know that ? You 're hard as fucking brick . " <p> A migraine gives off warnings : for me a patch of light , usually in the left eye , that then begins to cloud my vision . They 're caused by a constriction of the blood vessels in the brain , and over the years I 'd discovered ways to spot them coming and to take care of myself : usually a couple Midol-aspirin and 500 mg of caffeine-then a hot cup of coffee in a dark , silent room . Fiorinal , deliciously habit-forming , worked well ; morphine simply sent you to the moon . Apparently I 'd inherited the affliction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first diagnosed as another migraine . It was like learning to live with a bomb , always ticking , and was a constant reminder to be grateful when you could n't hear it . It was important , Laurie said , that I learn to control my blood pressure . <p> The morning of my father 's funeral in Point Pleasant , New Jersey , Laurie and I woke early . The beach was silent and asleep . My father 's dogs rooted in the sand , digging for clams . Having spent the night with us instead of at the kennel , the dogs no longer seemed disoriented or betrayed . Laurie and I were going to take them both to save them from being put down or , worse , split up . Joel already had a dog that his kids refused to play with . I pictured myself at a job , tape in hand , my dogs patrolling the lot : the independent contractor . The water , Laurie said , dipping her foot into the sea , was cold . She unbuttoned her blouse and called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " This is New Jersey , " I said . " It 's illegal . " <p> " No , " she said . " It 's your last chance . " <p> The water was cold-brisk as ice-and full of salt . Growing up near the beach , you appreciate the simple things : a clear sky and a fire , a pretty girl to swim with . We swam out first a hundred yards , then another . I 'd forgotten what it was like , being in the ocean . The sun was rising straight ahead , and there was the sky , and the water , and I realized I had at least for the moment become a happy man . <p> " You 're smiling , " Laurie said , over the waves . " About time , mister . " <p> " It 's too late , " I said , wishing it no longer was . I thought of my wife swimming in a chlorinated pool with a man named Hector Lopez . Eventually he would run for office-district attorney-which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , Neil , " Laurie said , sputtering . " It 's always too late . " <p> " You 're having an affair , " I said . " I did n't start that . " <p> " I 'm divorcing the only man I 've ever loved , " she said . " You tell me . You tell me what 's fair ! " <p> Living together for nearly a decade , we 'd learned not only to think alike but to speak alike as well-a lexicon set in code , refined by years of common history . For example , we each believed in quick disclosure so long as there was nobody nearby to listen in : a man would turn to sex because it did n't require that he believe in anything , a woman because the body was a less expensive item to offer up than her heart . It was something that would of course make perfect sense , so long as it were happening to another ; when we were first married , I 'd had my own summer of indiscretion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent man , but he was n't going to steal away my wife unless I let him . <p> Eventually we headed back to shore . The water had made us inexpressibly sad . Joel was standing there , beer in hand , his feet deep in the sand . Our clothes were piled beside him . He was talking on the phone . <p> We scrambled , pushed by the waves . Laurie called Turn around ! but he just smiled and waved . Now he pressed some buttons , shut the phone , turned his back to us while pointing with his foot to Laurie 's bra . <p> " Recognized this , " he said . " Figured it was somebody 's I knew . " <p> " It 's good , " I said . " You should take a dip . " <p> " Too much exercise , " he said , peeking , not at me . " Just lost another two-and-a-half mil . I 'm telling you , little brother , stay out of places where people carry rifles . No revolutionaries . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blouse , began to button up ; we shook sand from our clothes while Joel discussed the forthcoming collapse of bonds . <p> " OK , " Laurie said . " I 'm decent . " <p> " Of course you are , " Joel said , turning . " You 're rich . You 're beautiful . Your husband should have been a fucking priest . " <p> " Careful , " I said . " Be very careful . " <p> A thin woman , elderly , approached in her floral swimsuit . The sun had turned her skin to rawhide . She petted one of the dogs as if he might bite her , or were dead . Her hair might be gray , she explained , but she played tennis often . She commented on the quality of the beach . <p> " Private , you know . " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " Joel said , folksy as pie . " Proud of it . " <p> " I saw you , swimming like that . Good time , the morning . Just us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't you ? " <p> Joel insisted that we were , and it struck me that she did n't know our father was dead . She had a bracelet around her ankle , the electronic type used for cattle and parolees . <p> " You know , dear , " she said to Laurie . " You know , everybody around here owns a telescope . " She looked at me now , smiled , and said , " And your mother , too . Such good , nice people . " <p> Which of course is what we Hollands had become-good and nice , properly raised , exquisitely educated . My brother had an ulcer and stole sips of Pepto-Bismol whenever he thought nobody was looking . I suffered from recurring migraines and was about to divorce a woman whose life 's work was protecting the legal rights of aliens . Dressing for the funeral , which we 'd arranged to last less than twelve-and-a-half minutes , I remembered my insurance policy-a sudden wave of panic . <p> " Check 's in the mail , " Laurie said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " No , " I said . " I do n't think so . " I thought about my policy , about preexisting conditions , the need for eternal vigilance . A reliable postmaster , the ability to send things through the mail-my policy would take effect any day , and for a while , at least until the separation became legal , our emerging fortune would be safe . As it was , that emergency room visit was going to set us-no , me-back at least a couple thousand . <p> " I 'm glad he 's dead , " Laurie said , nodding into the mirror . " He was an evil man . " <p> " You do n't make money by spending it , " I said , wanting to be angry . " That 's what he always said . " <p> " He did terrible things to you , " she said . " He got beat up a little bit and decided to do his best to destroy you . " <p> " He was my father . And you did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't , " she said , straightening my tie . " And he did n't have to leave his estate to the John Birch Society . He did n't have to slap you from the grave . He did n't have to show up at our wedding with a gun ! " <p> I 'd forgotten about that , actually . Now , after spending years threatening to kill himself , he 'd finally gone and done it unintentionally . It was laughable . My father died alone because his children were no longer willing to visit him , let alone talk to him on the telephone . In the living room , waiting for us to finish dressing , Joel sat in my father 's chair , beside my father 's telescope , smoking . Joel said , looking up at me , in tears , " I am not going to feel guilty . I am not going to let him ruin my vacation . " <p> Now he lifted his beer , as if in a toast , and said , " To propriety , little brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just us-my brother , my wife-at the burial site . A backhoe , parked in the distance , had dug the trench square . Joel had picked out a nice coffin that was guaranteed by a salesman in Linden to last in perpetuity . For the most part I think my father believed the rights of family included the privilege of abuse : it was the supreme gift of genetics , complicated and deepened by tradition . Blood , my father reasoned , gave one the right to draw it from another at will ; if you were family , then you had to forgive , but after a while we had nothing left to forgive him with , and as a result my father died a lonely , bitter man and left his sons to carry on his legacy . The choice , of course , was ours to make-like whom you intend to love , despite the blood already spilled , or what you choose to forget because of it-the blood , which we filter with our lives , slowly , one hopeful and irrefutable day at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the lid of my father 's coffin , that we can be held accountable in this life only for what we know . And so knowing , we have no other way to turn : we 're going to have to try to live a decent life . Which is to say : after my father was lowered into the grave , I stood behind Laurie and laced my fingers tight around her belly . It was firm , smooth beneath the silk . I nuzzled her neck and knew then , right then , that I wanted to take her back to the sea . That night we would sit around the fireplace in my father 's empty house , as if waiting for him to become a proper ghost . Joel would tell stories about him , sloppily , until he finally drank himself to sleep . Then , if Laurie would permit me , I 'd begin to apologize : it would be the kind of reconciliation that might last for hours . In the morning , as the day turned ripe , we 'd return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . My wife , I 'd say , she likes the sea , and I 'd swim a bit farther out , waiting for her to come find me , which , thank God , she would . And we 'd stay there like that , treading water , the space between us fluid and lit eternally by the sky . Because this was finally a place that belonged to both of us , and something even I was allowed to have : a second chance . And I knew then this was going to be my home . Because this was my wife , to have and to hold , just like that , and right before the mercy of the grave . <p>
