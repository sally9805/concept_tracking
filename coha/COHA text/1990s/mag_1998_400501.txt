That 's why it 's a good habit to protect your skin from the sun year-round.This can be done by using a waterproof , SPF 15 ( sun protection factor ) sunscreen that protects against UVA and UVB rays and wearing protective clothing , including a wide-brimmed hat You should also avoid activity in the sun between the hours of 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the most intense.Wearing sunglasses will also help to prevent those wrinkles around the eyes called " crow 's feet " Sunglasses should have a label that reads " 99 percent UV protection or blockage " Smoking can also increase the number of wrinkles-another good reason not to smoke !
