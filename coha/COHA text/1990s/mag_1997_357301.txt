On the last weekend in August , my two young daughters and I will pack our suburban minivan with 2 1/2 gal . of water per person per day and head off to northern Nevada . There , in thousands of square miles of pure desert nothingness , 20,000 cheering , dancing celebrants will circle a towering , two-legged wooden sculpture and burn it to the ground . <P> It happens every Labor Day . Burning Man , as the festival is known , is an annual outbreak of techno-tribalism that has the makings of the next great American holiday . If this year 's party is like past ones , the immense desert flats will be teeming with offbeat stunts , weird art , flamboyant performances and bizarre , gasoline-powered contraptions . When we pulled up to Burning Man for the first time several years ago , we were greeted by a fat guy riding a large , furry rabbit motor scooter . He sat behind the ears . Across the desert we could see a truck hauling a mattress behind it , stirring up a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks were reclining on the mattress , waving insanely . <P> It gets even stranger . Each year a do-it-yourself city appears overnight . On one makeshift street , a three-story tower of scaffolding grows like a high-tech mushroom ; draped with a parachute , it becomes an instant cafe . At a table , generous folks with a spare gallon of blue body paint offer to turn you into an alien . Behind them , two guys have built a house out of old wooden doors hauled in on a yellow rental truck . Inside you hear hypnotic techno music . The house will be gone 48 hours later , as will the rest of the instant city . <P> This premillennial Woodstock got started 12 years ago when an unknown artist , Larry Harvey , built a wooden statue on a foggy beach near San Francisco and then set it on fire . For Harvey it was a catharsis to heal a broken relationship . For his friends it was a soul-energizing blast , and Harvey decided it should be an annual ritual . He cast a single brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , was to create " a Disneyland in reverse . " Everyone had to be a participant and march in the electric-light parade . <P> In succeeding years , Harvey 's wooden statue became a 40-ft. - high man ; the flames leaped higher , and the crowd grew ever more animated and theatrical . The intensity eventually taxed even the beatnik- and hippie-hardened San Francisco police , who asked Harvey and his acolytes to move off the beach . The Zen of the desert beckoned . <P> Once on the public lands of northern Nevada , where the rules are few and the possibilities infinite , Burning Man blossomed into a full-fledged happening . By word of mouth , via friend of a friend , with photocopied flyers posted in music stores , Burning Man quietly gathered a tribe of hundreds each summer to partake in the meaningless but mesmerizing ritual . And there , in its seclusion , it might still be , if it were n't for cyberspace . <P> News spreads quickly and efficiently via E-mail , and when the digerati got wind of Burning Man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silicon Valley and the Bay Area spend their workdays and worknights making little decentralized theaters of do-it-yourself creativity on the World Wide Web . Burning Man and its temporary city are material manifestations of the same creative urge . It was a perfect fit , a perfect way to celebrate a year of laboring on the Internet.
