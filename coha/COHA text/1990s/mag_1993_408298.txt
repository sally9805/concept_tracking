ANNE WILKINSON Remembers fondly the good old days when a trip to the beach meant only a swimsuit , towel , pail and shovel . These days , she says , she 's considering packing a suit of armour to protect her three - year - old from the sun . " With all the talk of'ozone depletion ' and the danger of sunburn , I 'm tempted to stop taking Taylor to the beach altogether . I do n't think summer holidays are ever going to be as much fun as when I was growing up . " Wilkinson 's concern is shared by a lot of parents . These days , we 're hearing a lot about the changes in the ozone and resulting danger from ultraviolet ( UV ) rays . But , in fact , overexposure to the sun has always posed serious health threats . The difference is that with a thinner ozone layer , it takes less time for the sun to burn our skin . What are the risks ? Well , long - term exposure to these UV rays can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin cancer premature aging of the skin higher incidence of cataracts , which may lead to blindness a weakening of the body 's immune system . Dr. J. Daniel Schachter is a consultant dermatologist at Toronto 's Women 's College Hospital . He says that children are the most at risk in the sun . Most adults know that there are certain risks to sun exposure , " Dr. Schachter says . " They will take steps to either avoid and cover up against the sun , or wear sun - screen . A child can not make these decisions , they do n't have the resources or information available to them . " Figure not transcribed Children spend much more time outdoors than adults . Researchers say that between 60 to 80 percent of our total lifetime exposure to the sun occurs before we turn 18 . It 's this early exposure to sun that can cause problems later in life . Sun damage is accumulative over a lifetime , so the less sun exposure and sun damage you have , the better chance you have of remaining healthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that parents like Wilkinson should panic , or that little Taylor should be taught to fear the sun . As with any old flame , the time has come to re - think our relationship to those rays . Facing the facts Many parents believe baby oil provides a simple and effective sunscreen . Wrong ! There are several myths about protecting your child from the sun . The baby oil myth is one  --  baby oil actually makes your skin burn faster . Another is that a tan or naturally dark skin isagood defence against the sun 's harmful rays . Dr. Schachter says that skin colour offers little advantage . While black skin is less susceptible to skin cancer , it is still important that a sunscreen be worn . A common assumption that most people make is that dark skin or a suntan will offer some protection , but this is not true . The sun protection factor ( SPF ) number of a tan is very low , offering very poor protection . So dark or black skin can still burn if over - exposed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get burned on a cloudy day or while swimming . Up to 80 percent of the sun 's rays can penetrate a light cloud cover . And swimmers ? Swimmers are exposed to light reflected off the water , which is much more intense than direct sunlight . Dr. Schachter says swimmers should be extra careful . " Children should swim in T - shirts , " he says , " and if possible , wear hats , to ward off any dangerous burning rays that are reflected from the water . " Not all sunlight is harmful . The danger is in the invisible UV rays . The biggest culprit is what scientists classify as UVB rays , the mid - range wavelengths . These rays burn and are believed to cause skin cancer . UVA rays are a little friendlier . They tan , but also age and wrinkle skin . Any kind of protection should be designed to limit skin 's exposure to these UV rays . The best defence is a threefold strategy : avoid the sun at peak times ; that is , between 11 a.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must go out in the sun during peak time , they should wear light - weight ( but not see - through ) long pants and long - sleeved shirts , a full - brimmed hat and UV - blocking sunglasses ; use effective sunscreen . Choose your sunscreen So what about a trip to the beach ? Well , a suit of armour is expensive and a tad toasty , but a good sunscreen is a must . Parents should choose one with a high SPF . The higher the SPF number , the more effective the sunscreen . The SPF of the sunscreen you buy for your child should be at least 15 , and up to 30 for younger children . And no cheating . A 7 applied twice as often is no substitute for a 15 . Also , check the label for the Canadian Dermatology Association 's logo . This means that the CDA has reviewed and approved the product . A creamy lotion is preferable to the clear kind . The latter usually contains alcohol , which can irritate your child 's skin . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sunscreen . Test the product first . Rub some lotion on a small patch on your child 's forearm a few days in a row . If the skin turns red or scaly , try another product . You also might want to avoid products that contain PABA . This stands for para - amino - benzoic - acid , and some people are sensitive to it . Remember , sunscreens do not increase exposure time . They offer some protection when exposure is unavoidable . As Dr. Schachter cautions , " Sunscreens do not offer unlimited protection . Simply because you are wearing SPF 45 does n't give you a licence to stay out in the sun all day with no repercussions . " Common sense is always the key . The good old days of summer ? Perhaps Wilkinson is right . Maybe they are gone forever . But with a little common sense and some practical information , today 's parents can look forward to the good new days of sun safety .

A QUICK GUIDE TO SUN SAFETY Sun safety is not difficult if you keep in mind a few simple points . The following list is adapted from information provided by the Canadian Dermatology Association . Babies are very sensitive to the sun ; keep them out of direct sunlight . Do not use sunscreen on babies under six months ; their skin may absorb chemicals in the lotion that are meant to block the sun . It 's tough in the summer holidays , but have your children avoid direct sunlight during the peak times for UVB rays , 11 a.m. to 3 p.m . If they do go out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - spectrum sunscreen  --  SPF 30 , and do n't be afraid to ladle it on , and often . Apply sunscreen before your children are dressed , to ensure that all skin will be covered . It 's a good idea to put the sunscreen on about a half hour before going out and remember to reapply the lotion after swimming or sweating . Special waterproof and water - resistant lotions are available and do work ; but still must be reapplied after swimming . Be careful with sunscreen around the eyes . Lip balm is just as effective , and will not run like lotion . A little dab of zinc oxide to the nose , cheeks , top of the ears and shoulders will help protect these often over - exposed parts of the body . The truth is that light - weight long pants and long - sleeved shirts offer the best protection against the sun . <p>
