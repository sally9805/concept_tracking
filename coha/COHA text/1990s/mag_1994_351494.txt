No one in pop music seems to have fun any more . Rapsters , grunge artists , even balladeers  --  their faces are all contorted into an Edvard Munch shriek , as if they were slaves to the agony of art . Hardly anyone wants to be an entertainer . <P> The world needs Spike Jones , the 1940s bandleader with a Dead End Kid 's mug and a wardrobe of cacophonous checks and plaids . Jones had fun with music . He took a sedate standard like Laura or Chloe , played it straight for a minute and then revved it up double-time and orchestrated it for tuba , kazoo and other instruments that mimic indiscreet bodily functions . Then he set this raucous pastiche to a junkyard syncopation of washboards , cap pistols , Klaxon and bicycle horns , pie pans and garbage cans  --  augmented by bird whistles , brays and tag lines from radio ads ( " Super Suds ! " " Bromo Seltzer ! " " Beeeeee Ohhhhhh ! " )  --  until the whole thing sounded the way Fibber McGee 's closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way Bart Simpson 's mind works . <P> From the day in late 1942 when Spike Jones &; His City Slickers stormed the charts with Der Feuhrer 's Face , they were the official naughty boys of music . They slowed down when Musicians Union boss James V. Petrillo imposed a two- year ban on union members ' making records , but they hit the top spot in late ' 44 , when their impudent version of Cocktails for Two sold two million records . Four years later , the holiday jape All I Want for Christmas ( My Two Front Teeth ) sold 1.5 million copies in six weeks . Jones cinched his renown with a high-rated radio show and an exhaustive skein of one-night stands . Chester Gould and Al Kapp put him into their comic strips . Movies and TV beckoned . For a decade , Lindley Armstrong Jones was the maestro satirist of the Hit Parade  --  and a crucial influence on such musicaliconoclasts as Stan Freberg , Ernie Kovacs , Tom Lehrer and Frank Zappa . <P> That was then , and it 's now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. Young 's carefully researched biography Spike Jones : The Man Who Murdered Music ( Past Times Publishing ; 00 pages ; $0.00 ) is making its own noise in book stores . Rhino Records has issued The Spike Jones Anthology , a handsome , 40- song dose of the band 's top tunes , including the chirping , barking , cackling Love in Bloom and the magnificent Hawaiian War Chant , which climaxes with a wail of electric-guitar dissonance that predates Jimi Hendrix by 20 years . A quirkier collection  --  Spiked ! , on Catalyst  --  has some prime oddities , notably a suave , six-part ribbing of The Nutcracker Suite ( 1945 ) , which must count as one of the earliest " concept albums . " <P> Spiked ! arrives with a cultural pedigree : cover art by Art ( Maus ) Spiegelman and liner notes by author-recluse Thomas ( Gravity 's Rainbow ) Pynchon . " Yet there remains about Spike 's work what is sometimes an almost uncomfortable complexity , " proclaims Pynchon , later anointing Jones as " a conceptual artist with a head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here too , for the Slickers never saw a text they could n't subvert . But Jones ' tactic was not deconstruction so much as demolition . His long-touring Musical Depreciation Revue was a frontal assault on sonic propriety . Even his nickname was an action verb , pithily expressing what the man did to music . He drove it into the ground , he impaled it on a drumstick , he laced it with aural rotgut , he deleted it from all genteel associations . He spiked it .
