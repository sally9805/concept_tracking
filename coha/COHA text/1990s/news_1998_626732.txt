<p> SALT LAKE CITY - Size matters . <p> Ever since James Naismith decided to hang a peach basket 10 feet over a YMCA gym floor , size has been the most desirable asset on the basketball court . <p> But some coaches are never satisfied . Have one good big man ? Hey , two must be better , right ? <p> It seems to be every coach 's dream , especially in the bigger-is-better world of the NBA . <p> Look no further than San Antonio , where Spurs coach Gregg Popovich had 7-1 All-Star center David Robinson , recently named one of the NBA 's 50 Greatest Players , in the middle . But that did n't stop Popovich from taking Tim Duncan , a 7-foot center out of Wake Forest , with the No. 1 pick in the 1997 NBA draft . <p> Presto , the Twin Towers is born . <p> Or reborn , to be more precise . <p> This version , which actually has grown into the " Tres Trees " lineup with 7-foot Will Perdue up front with Robinson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conference semifinals . Unfortunately , the Tres Trees are in danger of being felled , down 3-1 to the Utah Jazz entering tonight 's Game 5 at the Delta Center . <p> Even if the Spurs should be eliminated , many see the pairing of Robinson and Duncan , the Rookie of the Year , eventually working like no other big-man tandem . <p> Mostly because no other big-man tandem has really worked . <p> There have been several attempts to put together a two-center attack in the NBA , going back to 1964 , when the San Francisco Warriors put 6-11 rookie Nate Thurmond alongside Wilt Chamberlain . Chamberlain , who had set all kinds of scoring and rebounding records during his five years in the league , was traded to Philadelphia just 38 games into the 1964 season , which pretty much has been the fate of all the twin-tower experiments that followed . <p> New York did n't win a title until the Knicks got rid of Walt Bellamy and moved Willis Reed back to center , his usual position . The Knicks , apparently not learning their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , pairing Bill Cartwright with Patrick Ewing . <p> Three years later , Cartwright was the odd man out , traded in a move that helped create a championship team . Unfortunately for the Knicks , the team it helped was Chicago , where Cartwright , swapped for Charles Oakley , won three championships with the Bulls . <p> Then there was the teaming of Ralph Sampson and Hakeem Olajuwon in Houston , and you know how that one turned out . Like all the others before them , that towering tandem , which had advanced to the ' 86 NBA Finals , had to be broken up before the Rockets could win their two titles . <p> But some think San Antonio 's double dominators have a chance at doing what those others could n't - win a championship . <p> Stan Albeck , an assistant coach with the Atlanta Hawks , is one of those . And Albeck , who has coached Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , Artis Gilmore , Caldwell Jones and Dikembe Mutombo among others , knows a good big man when he sees one . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> " Everybody who coaches wants to coach a great big man , and here you have two , " Albeck said . " These guys ( Robinson and Duncan ) stand out because of their talent level . The only one that compares is when you go back to Wilt , who was , of course , very talented , and Nate . Those two guys were every bit as talented as Robinson and Duncan . <p> " But I think that the people we 're talking about in between , like Bellamy and Reed , did n't have the quickness or certainly the moves ( of Robinson and Duncan ) , who are great athletes . Sampson and Olajuwon are the only ones who are comparable ( athletically ) . <p> " I think probably the biggest difference is probably the effect that Duncan has had . In my mind , his competitive spirit has surprised everybody in the league . I think they knew he was going to be good , but I think they all thought he was going to have down days . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to Albeck , Duncan and Robinson have a chance to eventually win a title because they complement each other so well . Where other twin-tower alignments had players who were constantly stepping on each other 's toes , wrestling for the same spot in the low post , Duncan and Robinson can go inside or outside , depending on the individual matchups . <p> " I think a lot of that credit has to go to both guys , but to Robinson in particular , " Albeck said . " I 've read in the paper where Robinson said that Duncan is the guy who should take the last-second shot . And when you acquiesce to a rookie , you 're saying to everybody on that team , ' Hey , you 're the best player we have at crunch time . ' <p> " And for David Robinson to acknowledge that is pretty big of him . On the other hand , though , it puts enormous pressure on Duncan , but he 's been able to handle everything thrown at him throughout the course of the year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the playoffs . " <p> But Robinson 's willingness to step aside and make room for Duncan has made him a 7-1 lightning rod for criticism . Some say he 's not dedicated enough . Others insist he 's not tough enough , that he 's too soft . <p> Albeck thinks such talk is groundless . <p> " You have to question a lot of the criticism David gets , " Albeck said . " I 've seen a lot of games , and no one is quicker off his feet than he is . He shoots and that ball is hanging on the rim , and he 's off the floor like , ' Boom . ' He has the greatest second effort of any big man I 've seen . We have Dikembe ( in Atlanta ) , and if he gets the offensive rebound , he has to bring it down and gather himself before he goes up , so he gets knocked off-balance , he gets it ( the shot ) blocked or he gets fouled . <p> " That 's the difference with these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their feet , and I mean tremendously quick off their feet . And they have good basketball common sense . " <p> Duncan has proved to be an impact rookie , but there is work to be done . Some have called Duncan the most fundamentally sound big man to enter the league since Abdul-Jabbar in 1969 , but Albeck - and remember , he coached Abdul-Jabbar back then - says the Spurs rookie takes a back seat to Olajuwon in that department . <p> " I think the best footwork for any center or power forward in this league would be Hakeem , " Albeck said . " I 've never seen better footwork , where he could put distance between himself and the defender . Duncan is not that kind of player . He 'll turn right around , face up and has the ability to shoot the ball and make it , whether it be a bank or straight in , but he does n't present the distance ( between himself and the defender ) . <p> " I think next year will be a telling year for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somebody will find a way to maybe get him off the block , although that 's hard to do because of his size . But there will be something that people will find out about him and his offensive game , whereas Hakeem has solved most of those . <p> " He 's seen every defense that you can possibly throw at him , but this guy ( Duncan ) does n't see that on a constant basis because everybody respects Robinson so much . " <p> But does San Antonio management respect Robinson enough to give this twin-tower alignment a chance to work ? History has shown it 's usually the older player who is shown the door , so Robinson is probably the one who would leave should the Spurs decide one tower is sufficient . <p> " I definitely think that they can ( win a championship ) , " Albeck said . " I think that if you take a look at ( San Antonio 's ) weakness , it 's the bench . And , of course , with the salary cap being the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complement those two players up front to where you can win a championship . But I could never see the Spurs breaking up this combination of Duncan and Robinson . " <p> . . . <p> A tour of the towers <p> Contrary to what some might believe , when the Rockets paired Ralph Sampson and Hakeem Olajuwon , it was n't the first time a team had tried the twin-tower approach . It was n't even the first time it was tried in Houston , because Del Harris paired Moses Malone and Billy Paultz in his " Water Buffaloes " lineup that took the Rockets to the 1981 NBA Finals . The following is a brief look at some of the more notable attempts at a twin-tower attack : <p> . . . <p> Wilt Chamberlain and Nate Thurmond , San Francisco - The Warriors , which had the 7-1 Chamberlain , selected Thurmond , a 6-11 center out of Bowling Green , in the 1964 draft . Thurmond slid over to power forward to accommodate Chamberlain , who had set numerous NBA scoring and rebounding records in his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-lived , with Chamberlain being dealt to Philadelphia after 38 games . San Francisco , with Thurmond at center , made it to the 1967 NBA Finals , where they lost to - who else ? - Chamberlain and the 76ers . <p> . . . <p> Walt Bellamy and Willis Reed , New York - The Knicks selected Reed , 6-10 , out of Grambling State in the 1964 draft . The following year the Knicks traded three players to Baltimore for the 6-11 Bellamy and moved Reed to forward . The experiment lasted 3 1/2 years , when Bellamy was shipped to Detroit . The following year , in 1970 , the Knicks won the first of two titles with Reed back at center . <p> . . . <p> Artis Gilmore and Dan Issel , Kentucky ( American Basketball Association ) - Issel was an all-league center with the Colonels , but he stepped aside when Kentucky drafted 7-2 Artis Gilmore out of Jacksonville in 1971 . Gilmore gave the Colonels one of the few legitimate shot-blocking centers in the league , and he teamed with Issel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1975 ABA title . <p> . . . <p> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Jim Chones , Los Angeles Lakers - One of the few successful pairings . With the 7-2 Abdul-Jabbar in the middle , the Lakers traded to get the 6-11 Chones , a former All-Star center in Cleveland , before the 1979-80 season . The Lakers won the title that season , but it helped to have a rookie guard named Magic Johnson on that team . <p> . . . <p> Patrick Ewing and Bill Cartwright , New York - The Knicks , who had selected the 7-1 Cartwright in the 1979 draft , picked Ewing ( 7-0 ) out of Georgetown with the No. 1 pick in the 1985 draft . Three years later , Cartwright was sent to Chicago for Charles Oakley . Cartwright won three titles with the Bulls . Ewing is still waiting . <p> . . . <p> Hakeem Olajuwon and Ralph Sampson , Rockets - It was big news when the Rockets picked the 7-4 Sampson out of Virginia with the No. 1 pick in the 1983 draft . It did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest reason being the selection of a raw , young 7-footer ( then ) named Akeem Abdul Olajuwon out of the University of Houston with the top pick in the 1984 draft . The Sampson-Olajuwon tandem led the Rockets to the 1986 NBA Finals , but less than two years later , Sampson was gone , shipped to Golden State . But the Rockets did n't learn their lesson , getting 7-1 Joe Barry Carroll in the trade , a pairing that lasted less than a season .
