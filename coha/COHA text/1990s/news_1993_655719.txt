<p> WORKING with a shoestring budget but with a lot of enthusiasm , students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) here are designing a robot they hope one day will travel to Mars . <p> So far the group , called the Planetary Rover Baseline Experiment ( PROBE ) Laboratory , has built two prototypes : MITy-1 and MITy-2 . Their intended mission : to roll around the rocky surface of the fourth planet , perform experiments , and send the results back to Earth . <p> In building the prototypes , the 15 students who make up the lab are making discoveries that should help United States space scientists better understand the problems in sending robots to another planet . <p> " We 're providing data that is needed for robotic exploration , " says David Kang , the project 's manager and a scientist at the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory , which is funding part of the project and providing laboratory space for the students through a joint program with MIT . <p> The MIT students are one of four groups in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Redmond , a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) . Although each group is exploring a different approach , they all have the same goal : " To develop the technology and test its efficacy for the particular tasks which we know will be required , " he says . <p> Those tasks include navigating around the Martian surface , avoiding obstacles , and placing scientific instruments on the ground . In the Mars mission envisioned by the MIT students , scientists on Earth would begin each day by looking at a picture of the Martian landscape from the rover 's camera and choosing a target . The robot would then travel to that destination and send back measurements . Since the robots would be solar powered , they would shut down at the end of the day and " sleep " through the Martian night . <p> Because it takes radio waves up to 20 minutes to travel between the two planets , it is not possible to control an exploratory robot from Earth . Instead , the robot has to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extricating itself from problems when they arise . <p> " It has to distinguish between safe terrain and hazards , " explains Bill Kaliardos , a graduate student working on the robot . " As humans , we do that almost automatically . <p> For example , the robot needs to be able to steer around rocks and other obstacles in its path . In many cases , it is easier to simply go over the obstacles . One of the students ' early breakthroughs was developing a way to do that . <p> " It 's a new concept - a six-wheeled , articulated frame , " says Eric Malafeew , a graduate student in mechanical engineering who wrote parts of the robot 's control software for his master 's thesis . The segments of the robot 's body are attached with flexible springs . When the robot 's front wheels hit a rock , its body bends like an inchworm encountering a pebble . The design lets the rover climb objects " of its own height , " Mr. Malafeew says . <p> Not all obstacles can simply be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robot can detect a sudden drop . The computer constantly checks each of the sensors and stops the wheels if it detects a problem . And it needs to know when to ignore the readings from the sensors - for example , when it is pointed up into the air , climbing over a rock . <p> " One of the big reasons why this whole task is possible is that the robot is not going that fast - just one foot per second , " says Mr. Kaliardos . The robot 's slow speed gives it time to consider all the potential problems in its environment . <p> Until now , the only photographs of the Martian surface were taken from the two Viking landers in 1976 . " I 've always wondered what is beyond , " Dr. Kang says . " These rovers can take cameras beyond that horizon . " <p> The students started building their first robot , MITy-1 , in 1991 . In addition to six wheels and its on-board computer , MITy-1 has sonar sensors to detect its distance from obstacles , a magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to communicate with its base station , and batteries . <p> The group 's second robot , MITy-2 , was built in 1992 . MITy-2 has sensors designed to be more appropriate for the Martian environment . Since Mars has a much thinner atmosphere than Earth , a laser range finder replaces the earlier robot 's sonar sensors . <p> Most of the graduate students working on the project are in the " Draper Fellows " program , which pays tuition and provides them with a stipend in exchange for their work on a research project . Seven undergraduates also work on the project through MIT 's Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program . <p> " It 's been a good deal . We get our own desks and phones and have lots of computer resources , " Malafeew says . <p> Despite the funding , however , the budget is tight . Not counting labor , the students have spent less than $ 10,000 on each rover - virtually nothing in the high-priced world of space science . The low cost is partially a result of pursuing a " microrover " design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it lightweight ... everything gets smaller . You have to operate with much less power , less complex navigation , less sensors , and a smaller computer . " All that translates to savings . <p> To cut costs further , the students used off-the-shelf equipment , says Kaliardos , who will receive his master 's degree in June for work on the rover 's sensors and hazard-avoidance systems . <p> Mars does n't have a magnetic field , so instead of a compass , MITy-2 is equipped with a home-made sextant : By observing the direction of the sun and comparing it with the current time , the robot can figure out in which direction it is pointing . The students built their sextant out of the lens from a front-door peephole that they bought at a local hardware store . <p> Because the students ca n't test their robot on Mars , they 've had to rely heavily on computer simulation to verify their design . " I 'm trying to figure out where the center of gravity is and see at what point it will roll over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master 's degree this May for computer work that simulates how the rover behaves when crawling over obstacles . <p> But more than any single technical innovation , says Kang , what 's important about the project is that all the research has been done by students . In addition to meeting NASA guidelines for the weight and size of the rover , " these projects have to fulfill student thesis requirements . " <p> Kaliardos likes working on the robots because it has given him a chance to work " hands-on " with space technology . <p> " A lot of this dealt with electrical engineering and avionics - the kind of thing that I did n't pick up in my undergraduate education . It opened up a lot of doors , " he says . <p> NASA may send its first robot to Mars as early as 1996 , says Donna Pivirotto , who heads a similar microrover project at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , Calif . The mission " is scheduled to launch in November 1996 and land on Mars in November 1997 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , JPL plans to send its own micro-rover to Mars on the first mission . " We only have until 1996 to get a flight rover ready to go , and MITy is n't there , " she says . <p> Nevertheless , the MIT students are working at improving their robot 's spaceworthiness . This summer , they hope to simulate part of a Martian mission with a 12-hour field test in a quarry near Boston . And at the end of next year , Kang plans to " design freeze " the robot - that is , stop changing the design , and concentrate solely on issues of durability and reliability . <p> " If they decide to launch the JPL rover and have a couple of kilograms left over , they could put ours on too , " Kang says hopefully .
