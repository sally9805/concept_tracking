<p> The mounting toll of the AIDS epidemic on San Francisco 's financially strained health-care system was highlighted by two reports released yesterday . <p> Warning that a second wave of AIDS infections has arrived , public health experts predicted that 1,000 of the city 's men , women and children will become infected with HIV this year alone . <p> The study by epidemiologists with the city 's AIDS office estimates that 28,000 San Franciscans  --  one in 25  --  are already infected with HIV , which weakens the immune system and leads to AIDS . <p> Separately , Dr. Sandra Hernandez , the director the Health Department 's AIDS office , reported that the city is likely to see as many as 9,000 or more new AIDS cases this year . Hernandez based her conclusion on the spread of the disease to more segments of the population and on an expanded definition of what constitutes the disease . <p> The costs of medical care for these new patients , Hernandez said , are likely to add $ 5.8 million a year to the already crushing fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And because community organizations are already overburdened by people with AIDS seeking medical care , social services , psychological help and housing , the agencies will be forced to start severely rationing what they can offer , according to Dr. Mitchell H. Katz of the AIDS office . <p> The national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta has announced that April 1 it will make a significant change in its definition of AIDS , more than doubling the size of the nation 's caseload of AIDS patients . Until now , an HIV-infected person had to show symptoms of one or more AIDS-induced " opportunistic " infections in order to be diagnosed with the disease . But the new definition will include everyone infected with HIV . <p> The distinction is extremely important because the huge expenses of the disease  --  estimated at $ 5,150 annually for a single patient 's medical care alone  --  can quickly impoverish most people with AIDS . Up to now , federal funds have paid the bills of indigent patients through Medi-Cal , but federal authorities have refused to recognize the CDC 's new definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs like AZT to delay the onset of illness , communities such as San Francisco will have to take on the fiscal burden . <p> In an article being published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association , Hernandez and Katz , together with Dr. Sophia Chang of the AIDS office , estimate that the new definition will add as many as 440,000 HIV-infected Americans to the national total of people with AIDS . That total stands at 206,000 today . <p> In San Francisco , about 3,800 people are estimated to be ill with AIDS today , and that number will increase this year to somewhere between 7,000 and 9,200 , Hernandez and her colleagues estimated . <p> Katz noted that all the privately financed community services that have long been an AIDS-care model for the nation will have to start rationing their care . <p> The other study , forecasting 1,000 new HIV infections this year , was based on data from 17 reports . <p> The predicted number of new infections is the most ominous and significant finding of the report , according to its author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Branch . " A few years ago , we would have expected to see only 500 to 600 new cases this year , " he said . <p> Among various San Francisco groups at risk , there were these grim predictions : <p> * Gay men : 650 will be infected with HIV this year , primarily because of unsafe sexual practices that are causing a " second wave " of infection . The highest incidence rate , 4 percent a year , is among young gay men ages 17 to 25 . Young gays will account for 200 new infections this year . <p> * Drug users : 230 will be infected by contaminated hypodermic syringes . An estimated one in eight users , 1,700 people , are already infected . <p> * Women : 180 new infections , primarily caused by use of contaminated needles or sexual contact with an infected drug user . There are an estimated 1,100 women in San Francisco already infected . <p> * Heterosexual males : 50 new infections among straight men who do not inject drugs . There are about 250 infections currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be born this year with antibodies to HIV , but only five are expected to show actual infection after further testing . <p> With the report , the city is raising its estimate of the new infection rate among the city 's gay population to 2 percent a year , a level equal to that among injection drug users . The new infection rate among drug users has stabilized . <p> San Francisco 's gay community has clearly borne the brunt of the epidemic . <p> " We 're looking at a devastating situation here , " said Rene Durazzo , public policy director for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation . " If San Francisco , the model for HIV-prevention , is having 1,000 new cases a year , what 's happening in cities and communities that have marginal prevention activities ? " <p> Durazzo noted that the Centers for Disease Control cut its $ 500 million prevention budget this year by $ 15 million and that state financing for prevention efforts has remained stable at $ 15 million over the past five years . <p> " There has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This report shows we are paying the price , " he said . <p> Valerie Kegebein , chief of San Francisco 's AIDS prevention branch , said the city spends about $ 10 million a year on prevention programs . <p> She said that although AIDS prevention messages have gotten through to much of the at-risk population , it is vital to keep up the flow of such information . <p> CHART : HIV INFECTION IN SAN FRANCISCO . Incidence of HIV infection among various risk groups . HIV infection means that a person carries the human immunodeficiency virus , which breaks down the immune system and eventually causes AIDS .

" Effective April 1 , the national Centers for Disease Control will define people with AIDS as those who are infected with HIV , the AIDS virus , and whose CD-4 cell counts  --  a measure of immune system impairment  --  are 200 or below . <p> Dr. Sandra Hernandez , chief of the San Francisco Health Department 's AIDS office , said yesterday that the new CDC definition of AIDS is primarily a diagnostic category and will not affect the health or physical well-being of an individual who may or may not fall into the new category . <p> Yesterday 's article also stated incorrectly that as many as 9,000 or more new cases of AIDS will be reported in San Francisco this year . There are an estimated 3,800 people living with AIDS in the city already , and the Health Department estimates that between 5,000 and 7,000 more HIV-infected people could fall under the new and expanded definition of the disease . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : FEBRUARY 20 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chart accompanying the article that showed infection rates among gay men , heterosexual men , and women , some editions of The Chronicle incorrectly stated that the figures for gay men did not include injection drug users . There were 3,000 injection drug users included among the 58,000 gay men .
