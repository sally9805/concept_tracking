In the aftermath of the Littleton massacre , our nation 's capital and its entertainment capital-once more-than-friendly bedfellows-are locked in mortal combat over the future of violence in TV and film . Ca n't these two superpowers just get along ? // Not if Hollywood has anything to say about it . In fact , Hollings ' bill and a slew of other post-Littleton proposals aimed at toning down violence in entertainment-including legislation to make it illegal to film violent images on public property , as well as the idea to make it a federal crime to sell a ticket for an R-rated movie to a minor-are threatening to trigger the bloodiest battle between L.A. and D.C. in decades . Already the winds of war ( or at least the windbags ) can be heard rumbling on Capitol Hill . And Hollywood is blowing back just as hard . " To some people in Washington , Hollywood is a big fat target , " bristles Motion Picture Association of America head Jack Valenti . " It 's easy to say , if we cut the wires and darken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tranquillity back to our streets . But by piling on Hollywood , they 're distracting from the real issues-like guns . " Of course , piling on Hollywood is n't exactly unheard of in Washington . Conservatives have been saving the republic from the likes of Murphy Brown and Ellen DeGeneres for years . But these latest troop movements in the Culture War are potentially much more provocative . The image of all those teenage corpses in Colorado has given the issue a heightened sense of seriousness and urgency . Also  --  and much more ominously for Hollywood-it 's no longer just Republicans jumping on the pile . " There is still too much violence on our nation 's screens , large and small , " declared President Clinton , upbraiding Hollywood during his weekly radio address on May 15 . There are " too many creators and purveyors of violence ... too many vulnerable children who are steeped in this culture of violence . " To a lot of the creators and purveyors listening in-especially the ones who helped donate $2 million at a Clinton fund-raiser in Hollywood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To be publicly spanked by the same hands that are very frequently open and looking for money in this town is somewhat hypocritical , " complains producer Steve Tisch ( American History X , Forrest Gump ) . " And to characterize this industry as irresponsible is in fact a very irresponsible statement . " The President had gotten an even colder shoulder from Hollywood a week earlier , when he asked dozens of studio heads , actors , and music execs to sit down with gun manufacturers for a White House rap session on youth violence . Unsure what they had in common with makers of semiautomatic weapons , many turned him down . Valenti , Gloria Estefan , and erstwhile Melrose Place hunk Andrew Shue were among the few who showed up . Although Valenti has been holding summits of his own-including a May 24 caucus attended by virtually every studio chief in town-so far Hollywood has n't hit on a unified strategy to deal with the Washington offensive . Some have decided the best defense is capitulation-or else they 've sincerely discovered a newfound sensitivity to on-screen violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slayer fans found themselves dangling mid  --  cliff-hanger when The WB yanked the second part of the show 's season finale " out of sympathy and compassion " for the Littleton families . The episode , which will air later this summer , contained a scene in which a high school graduation ceremony explodes into violence-when the mayor turns into a 60-foot serpent and attacks the students . CBS , meanwhile , nixed a whole series from its fall lineup-the Donnie Brasco-style Mafia drama Falcone  --  because network head Leslie Moonves found himself " cringing " watching the pilot . " It was n't in bad taste , " he says . " Is murder bad taste ? But we felt a responsibility not to put it on now . It just did n't feel right . " Some film directors are also recoiling from the sight of fake blood . Jonathan Demme is said to have decided against lensing the Silence of the Lambs sequel because Thomas Harris ' slice  --  and-dice manuscript upset him too much . ( His publicist insists he just has " sequelitis . " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doom have shown no signs of appeasement , Cedar Fair amusement parks recently announced it was hauling away any carnage-heavy videogames . Others in Hollywood are taking a more wait-and-see attitude . " If a hurricane comes , you go to the cellar until it 's over , " says RKO Pictures head Ted Hartley . " You do n't want to be the lightning rod that stands up against all this . This thing will blow over . " Still others-like a powerful studio chief who would talk only under the condition of anonymity-have fallen back on the classic Hollywood defense of blaming somebody else . " Washington should be concerning itself with videogames , " says the well-known player . " Those things really glorify violence . " But if tensions worsen between L.A. and D.C.-two of America 's mightiest one-industry towns ( two-industry , if you count the manufacturing of egos )  --  you can bet Hollywood will marshal a tough resistance . Especially if it starts seeing any collateral damage at the ticket counters . " If it becomes a felony to sell an R-rated ticket to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit taken at the box office because of all the panic " it would cause at movie theaters , predicts director Keith Gordon ( who , as a teenager , starred in the R-rated Dressed to Kill ) . " That 's going to affect Hollywood 's pocketbook . It 's going to cost them money . They 'll fight back .

Before Littleton , Hollywood violence had been under fire in the courts . A lawsuit in Louisiana seeks to make Oliver Stone and Time Warner financially responsible for violence committed by two teens supposedly influenced by Natural Born Killers . Last month , The Jenny Jones Show and Warner Bros. lost a suit against the show and were ordered to pay $25 million to the family of a gay guest who was murdered by another guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Local governments have been making trouble too : The Chicago City Council is looking into whether guests who get into fights on The Jerry Springer Show can be charged with assault . ( What 's the world coming to when cross-dressing lesbian strippers ca n't punch each other out on TV ? ) But the biggest threat to mayhem as usual in Hollywood ( and here we have the sort of deft ironic flourish you do n't find in enough film scripts these days ) could turn out to be the gun-control legislation just passed by the Senate  --  with wide support from Hollywood liberals . It 's called the Juvenile Crime Bill , and in all the hoopla over its hotly debated loophole-tightening gun-show-sales restrictions , you might have missed one of its not-so  --  minor amendments , a few turgid little paragraphs pointed at Hollywood like the barrel of a .44 Magnum . Roughly translated , it reads : " Make my day . " The amendment funds a $2 million investigation of the creative policies and advertising practices of entertainment companies ( from studios to music labels to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if violence is deliberately being used as a marketing tool to entice teenagers . Like the commission that dug up dirt on the tobacco industry , it would have subpoena power , which means private studio memos , script notes , and e-mails may soon be playing publicly at a congressional hearing near you . Not to mention possible testimony from the most photogenic witnesses ever dragged up the Hill ( imagine Arnold Schwarzenegger at the witness table , cupping a hand over the microphone for whispered consultations with his publicist ) . " There 's no question there are some in Hollywood who are exploiting urges in young people with ultraviolent images , " says Sen. Orrin Hatch , the Utah Republican who cosponsored the amendment . " There are studies galore that continual exposure to these types of materials-violence , pornography  --  has a profound impact on young minds . So it would behoove the entertainment industry to step forward to reduce inappropriate violence . " Otherwise , he adds , Dirty Harry  --  style , " we have the recourse of forcing them to do it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juvenile Crime Bill is still in development ( as they say in L.A. ) , with no guarantee it 'll pass in the House . Other Littleton-inspired bills have already run into trouble , blocked by legislators still on speaking terms with Hollywood . " There were other amendments that were much worse , " says Sen. Barbara Boxer , a Democrat from ( where else ? ) California . " There was one that would have set up a commission to look into whether the government should actually regulate the content of movies . It was really terrifying . I got up on the floor of the Senate and said , What is this ? The Soviet Union ? " ' Boxer helped defeat that amendment in a 58-42 vote . She was also one of the senators who said nay to Hollings ' proposal banishing TV violence to the late-night airwaves , killing it with a 60-39 vote . A vote , it turns out , taken nearly a week before Hollings held his drone-fest in room 253 . Why would the senator bother to conduct hearings on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beltway insider could answer that question . Fortunately , we have one standing by-a high-ranking aide to a senator who voted against Hollings ' bill . " Oh , you know , " he explains matter  --  of-factly , " that 's show business .
