My partner is so hung up on the rules and stuff . I get pissed sometimes and go , " You just do n't even expletive understand . This job is not rules . This is a feeling . Expletive the rules ; we 'll make them up later . "  --  Former Los Angeles police detective Mark Fuhrman in a tape-recorded conversation <P> ON NOV. 22 , 1988 , A POLICE officer obtained a routine warrant to search Joseph Morris ' Philadelphia steak house by claiming he had watched a teenager sell marijuana outside a local high school , had followed him into the restaurant and had seen him hand a roll of cash to Morris . The officer said he saw Morris hand back a brown paper bag . The officer said he then followed the teen to the street and bought some marijuana , which the teen pulled out of the bag . After breaking down the door of the steak house with a sledgehammer , officers said they found marijuana there and arrested Morris . Based on the sworn testimony of officer Steven Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years in prison . <P> But Brown 's testimony was a skein of lies . There was no teenager , no exchange of cash or drugs inside the shop , no brown paper bag and no drug buy . Last March , Brown , a 13-year veteran on the force , pleaded guilty to federal charges involving 25 cases , including the illegal search of Morris ' steak house . After nearly 2 1/2 years in prison , Morris was released . While he has his freedom , peace of mind is a little harder to come by . " It takes a lot away from you , " says the 53-year-old father of five , now a self-employed carpenter . " I ca n't understand why these people can do anything they want and get away with it . " <P> It is the best of times , it is the worst of times for police departments and the citizens they are sworn to protect . News of declines in the rates of violent crime nationwide has been drowned out by the sound of Mark Fuhrman 's voice filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the former cop describes the brutalizing of suspects , fabrication of evidence and abuse of minorities . Although the O.J. Simpson jury will hear only two small snippets of the Fuhrman screed , to the rest of America the tapes provide a profane voice-over to real-life police corruption and brutality dramas that have been playing out not only in Los Angeles  --  where last Friday two officers were implicated in evidence tampering in a murder case  --  but also in New York City , Philadelphia , New Orleans , Minneapolis , Detroit and Washington . <P> The surprise here is not that police corruption exists or that there are , to use law-enforcement officials ' favorite metaphor , always " a few bad apples . " The question is why police departments appear locked in a perpetual cycle of scandal , repentance , pledges of reform and fresh scandal , seemingly unwilling or unable to police themselves . The answer in part lies in the way departments are set up and managed , and also within the hearts of the officers themselves . " The people in a position to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , " explains James Fyfe , a former New York City cop who teaches criminal justice at Temple University . " There 's a sense that their loyalty should be to the department , not to the public . "
