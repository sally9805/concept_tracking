Ritalin is prescribed almost reflexively to treat attention deficit disorders . But there are safer , gentler alternatives // Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( AD/HD ) is a problem of grave concern , and a source of great confusion , to the millions of children , parents and teachers whose lives are disrupted by it . Technically , it 's not one disorder but rather an umbrella term the American Psychiatric Association has given to the three recognizable subtypes , or forms , of the disorder : inattentive , hyperactive and impulsive . Still , the disorder is commonly referred to as AD/HD and we typically think of the AD/HD child as having difficulties focusing , concentrating and sitting still as well as being aggressive , defiant , overly emotional , resistant to discipline and accident-prone . Studies indicate that AD/HD children usually have normal or even above-average IQs , yet there 's a tendency for the condition to be present along with learning disabilities , such as language-processing problems or memory disorders . Consequently , the AD/HD child is often relegated to special-education classes . To ease the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a stimulant medication that usually provides fast and effective relief but comes with a host of drawbacks . There 's a new wave of researchers who ardently believe that AD/HD should not be treated with Ritalin alone ( and perhaps not with Ritalin at all ) , because the disorder is actually a manifestation of biochemical disturbances that can be corrected by cleaning up your child 's diet and environment . The following is an excerpt from a new book by certified nutritionist Marcia Zimmerman , called The A.D.D . Nutrition Solution : A Drug-Free 30-Day Plan ( Henry Holt , 1999 ) . Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( AD/HD ) is the fastest-growing childhood disorder in the United States . According to information published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in November 1996 , an astounding 5 to 7 percent of American children and teens-approximately 4 million , 80 percent of whom are boys-are believed to suffer from attention deficits . In some areas of the country , about half of all students are labeled as victims of this mentally disabling disorder . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it , bringing the total to a staggering 17 million Americans who battle the condition on a daily basis . The treatment most often recommended for alleviating AD/HD symptoms is stimulant medication , most commonly methylphenidate ( Ritalin , manufactured by Novartis ) . According to several government research institutes , 80 percent of the children taking it will continue to need it as adolescents and 50 percent of them into adulthood . The United States consumes five times more Ritalin than the rest of the world combined . Consumption of the drug has grown over 600 percent in the past decade-from 50 million pills in 1986 to 350 million in 1996 , with sales revenues totaling nearly half a billion dollars annually . Photograph // And yet , while Ritalin has helped thousands , many specialists agree that use of stimulant medication alone is not the answer because even though it may offer practically instant relief , it does not address the source of the problem . Treating the cause involves behavioral and nutritional modification , courses of action that take longer to be effective but that offer lasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects , including insomnia , slowed growth , facial tics , depression , a decreased zest for life and liver damage . Most professionals agree that Ritalin should never be the only course of treatment used , even if it is the most convenient . Thomas Achenbach , Ph.D. , stated the issue clearly in an article published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in May 1995 . " An important question for physicians to consider is whether stimulant medication alone results in more harm than benefit to the child and his family , since it may convince the parents that the child is receiving adequate treatment and divert attention from the need for treatment aimed at other associated disabilities such as poor self-image , antisocial behavior and learning disabilities . " Furthermore , the statistics on the single-treatment approach to AD/HD do not show significant long-term success . Despite the use of stimulant medication in childhood , many adolescents continue to have major attention deficit symptoms as well as academic , emotional or social problems without additional treatment methods . Environmental Factors In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doing to our environment with pesticides in her now-classic Silent Spring ( Houghton Mifflin , 1962 ) . Today there are hundreds of studies demonstrating the harmful effects of pesticides and heavy metals on the development of the fetus and young child , yet only a handful address the question of neurological problems . But despite the lack of conclusive research , it is reasonable to assume that substances that can cause visible damage to a fetus or child can injure the brain as well . Possible environmental factors in AD/HD include exposure to pesticides in food , air and water ; cleaning products ; heavy metals ( lead , mercury , cadmium , arsenic ) ; and the overuse of antibiotics , especially to treat children 's recurrent ear infections . Since concrete proof is hard to come by , there 's no consensus among experts on the degree to which these toxins influence AD/HD . In fact , one the few things that all AD/HD specialists do agree on is that the disorder runs in families , whether that means it 's inherited or learned through family behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a third factor influencing AD/HD occurrence , and one that holds the key to a safe and effective therapeutic treatment , is diet . Medical experts have traced the origin of many chronic diseases-cardiovascular disease , cancer , diabetes , arthritis-to unhealthy changes in American eating habits over the past 50 years . Yet we have been slow to make the same association between diet and the fastest-growing chronic and lifelong disability , AD/HD . Concerned about children 's eating habits , the U.S. Department of Agriculture analyzed the dietary practices of 3,000 children and adolescents between 1989 and 1991 and published the results in the journal Pediatrics ( September 1997 ) . They found that only 1 percent of those interviewed met all the national recommendations for daily servings from all the food groups and that 16 percent did n't meet any requirements . Even more disturbing , nearly half the daily calories consumed came from fat and sugar . It 's bad enough that Americans , and especially American kids , eat too much fat , sugar and processed foods and not enough whole grains , fruits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods we love are loaded with over 2,800 additives-all of which have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Most of these additives , so common in American foodstuffs , have been banned in many European countries . The FDA estimates that the average child consumes between 150 milligrams ( mg. ) and 300 mg. of additives a day in processed foods , beverages and candy-which is three to four times the amount that caused children 's hyperactive behavior to worsen in clinical trials . Diet is the cornerstone of good health and , in the case of AD/HD , the key to treatment . Sugar is probably the number one culprit in exacerbating the condition , but it 's not the whole story . Effectively treating AD/HD requires discipline and vigilance on the parents ' part about getting their child the proper mix of protein , carbohydrates , fats and supplements and weeding out processed foods , especially those containing " bad " fats and additives . Food Allergies Allergies are the immune system 's response to foreign elements . We develop allergies to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes into contact with or because small particles of the food escape undigested into our bloodstream , where the immune system reacts to the foreign presence with a cascade of defensive responses . Signs of this immune response include localized inflammation , itching , burning or sneezing . While conventional medicine considers allergies and behavior unrelated , some experts , like Paul Marshall , Ph.D. , of the University of Minnesota , are convinced that there is a relationship between allergies and AD/HD behaviors . Writing in the Alternative Medical Review ( April 1998 ) , Alan Gaby , M.D. , of Bastyr University in Seattle , described how food allergies are believed to cause a range of physical and mental conditions and how identifying and then avoiding those foods can relieve a number of common and difficult to treat medical problems , including AD/HD . Food allergies are believed to affect between 75 and 80 percent of children with AD/HD . A clue to which foods your child might be allergic is something called the addictive response . " Must-have " foods are often those that produce an allergic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoking food that results in a craving for that food . When the food is withdrawn , the individual may become quite ill during the first days of the substance 's elimination . Experts like James Braly , M.D. , an allergy specialist , maintain that four out of five children with AD/HD are helped by removing " provoking foods " and additives from their diet . The list of common provoking foods he cites includes cow 's milk , eggs , wheat , corn , chocolate and oranges . Food as Medicine While nutrition is a complex and often contradictory area of science , it is clear that diet strongly affects our health , behavior and brain function . With AD/HD , the first thing we need to examine is sugar , since research shows that people with AD/HD are usually quite sugar-sensitive . Glucose , or blood sugar , is produced in our bodies when we eat carbohydrates . Every cell uses glucose to generate energy to carry out bodily functions . While most cells can also convert fats and proteins into glucose , brain cells can not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain will ultimately affect all body systems . Research suggests that people with AD/HD have a disruption in glucose metabolism in the frontal region of their brains . Eating sugar-a relatively new experience for humans in evolutionary termsactually lowers brain glucose . The more sugar we consume , the lower those levels become . The brain compensates for the lowered levels by activating norepinephrine , a brain chemical that increases alertness and concentration ( and which comes from protein foods ) . Sugar consumption also causes a release of insulin , whose action leads to the release of calming serotonin and consequently , a shift in brain chemistry balance . Ultimately , a vicious cycle is set up as the brain demands more glucose : We eat more sugar , then insulin kicks in , further lowering glucose levels . The AD/HD sufferer who chooses sugar may calm his brain down ( from the serotonin ) , but he will also decrease his attention span and increase his mood swings . For some people , hyperactivity is a natural response to the lower glucose levels , as their bodies try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain struggles to maintain communication between neurons , but the transmissions become less efficient , making it very difficult to concentrate . Because carbohydrates supply most of the fuel the body burns for energy , they are very important to everyone . But the kind of carb foods and the time of day they 're eaten determine how they affect your brain function . There are two kinds of carbs : simple ( sugar in all its forms : table sugar , sucrose , Fructose , dextrose , maltodextrin , brown sugar , corn or cane syrup , honey , molasses , date sugar , maple sugar and fruit sweetener ) and complex ( vegetables , beans , whole grains , pasta ) , which are better because they release glucose into the system gradually , slowing the release of insulin and preventing its deleterious effect on brain function . When carbs are consumed is a factor as well . If your child eats a high-carb breakfast ( white bread , sugary cereal , fruit , fruit juice ) without a balance of protein ( soy , egg , peanut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or will be hyperactive all morning . If he then eats a high-carb or sugary lunch , the effect can last the entire school day . Overcoming AD/HD , especially in children , requires the consumption of a high percentage ( 30 percent of daily calories ) of high-quality protein . For a vegetarian , that means eating plenty of organically grown vegetables ; legumes , such as soybeans and peas , and whole grains , which also contain the necessary protein , essential fatty acids ( EFAs ) , vitamins and minerals . Give Us a Month ... The ideal way to eradicate AD/HD symptoms is with a nutritionally balanced diet that delivers 40 percent of daily calories as complex carbohydrates , which will regulate insulin and brain chemistry and help reduce AD/HD symptoms and keep children in balance throughout the day . In general , here are the basic guidelines . Serve a wide variety of complex carbohydrates . Balance carbs with proteins : In the morning , 30 percent protein and 40 percent carbs ; in the evening , 20 percent protein and 70 percent carbs ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canola and nut oils . Include EFAs ( best veg source : flaxseeds ) . In addition , you should eliminate the following foods from your diet : All hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated fats , trans and dairy fats ( some butter is okay ) ; mono and diglycerides ; fried foods ; Olestra and Olean ; tropical fats ( palm , palm kernel , coconut , cottonseed oil ) . Dairy products and foods containing dairy components : casein , lactalbumin , whey , lactose , egg whites . Chocolate Wheat Corn Oranges Peanuts Sweeteners : cane or beet sugar ; refined starches like corn syrup , cornstarch , modified food starch , maltodextrin , high fructose corn syrup ; all artificial sweeteners . Additives : all artificial colors , especially red dye no. 3 and yellow dye no. 5 . Flavors : MSG , vanillin , smoke , salt , sodium-containing agents and sodium or potassium phosphate . Preservatives : BHA , BHT , TBHQ , sodium benzoate , calcium propionate , nitrates and nitrites , sulfites and citric acid . Beverages : all caffeinated tea , coffee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phosphates . Although it 's the cornerstone of a lifetime of freedom from AD/HD symptoms , dietary change alone is not sufficient . Supplements are also essential . Children need EFAs , calcium , magnesium , vitamin C , the B vitamins and several trace minerals ( notably iron , manganese , copper , cobalt , selenium and chromium ) . By turning our attention to what our families are eating-and not ignoring the essential micronutrients that are typically overlooked in mainstream medicine-I am confident that we can beat AD/HD and help our children lead healthy and productive lives .

In her new book , Alternative Treatments for Children Within the Autistic Spectrum ( Keats Good Health Guide , 1999 ) , behavioral therapist Deborah Golden Alecson , M.S. , discusses the standard criteria for assessing whether your child has an attention deficit disorder .

When assessing a child 's ability to " attend " or stay still , you must also consider the degree to which his development , self-esteem and growth are being affected . It 's important , too , to realize many educational systems expect children to pay attention or sit still all day to an unrealistic and selfdefeating extent . That said , here are the diagnostic criteria for AD/HD , as described in the psychologist 's handbook , The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition ( DSM-fV . Note : You need six or more symptoms to have persisted for at least six months and to have been present before age seven to warrant a diagnosis of AD/HD .
