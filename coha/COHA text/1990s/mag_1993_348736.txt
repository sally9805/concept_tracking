In Baghdad 's art galleries hang heartrending depictions of slaughter , ruin and misery , painted since the Gulf War . On the sidewalks , poor families sell their meager household goods to procure enough money to eat . In the back alleys , women offer their bodies for sale  --  an extreme act of desperation in Muslim society  --  and men steal cars or rob their neighbors ' houses . <P> These are not the people that Saddam Hussein counts on . He has drawn around himself a tight circle of supporters , loyal members of his al-Tikriti clan , whose interlocking relationships ensure his control of the security services , the military and the Baath party . The army is run by a cousin who launched poison-gas attacks against the Kurds in 1988 and destroyed Shi'ite holy sites in the south after the war . Internal security is entrusted to two half- brothers , and Saddam 's younger son , Qusai , 26 , was recently put in charge of the 10,000-man presidential guard . Another half-brother , Barzan al-Tikriti , has just returned from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as presidential adviser . He is also the overseer of Saddam 's personal financial empire , allegedly a $30 billion fortune amassed by skimming 5% off Iraq 's oil revenues since Saddam became President in 1979 . Because $5.5 billion in official Iraqi accounts has been frozen abroad , Saddam is suspected of tapping his private accounts to finance restoration of the country . <P> Two years after Saddam 's shattering defeat in the Gulf War , the Iraqi dictator remains in full control of the Baghdad government . Though he has lost his hold on Kurdistan in the north and over parts of the Shi'ite south , he has bottled up the insurgents in both regions so they do not threaten his rule . Every step he takes has been aimed at buttressing his authority . He rebuilt Baghdad and the central region , where his Sunni Muslim backers hold sway ; he gives government workers and members of the armed forces regular pay increases and relentlessly bombards the nation with self-serving propaganda . <P> As a result , Saddam 's power base remains solid . Postwar clashes with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who provide the bulk of Saddam 's military and civilian support . " When things threaten to fall apart , " says Baghdad novelist Jabra Ibrahim Jabra , " you stick with the man who can hold it together . Saddam was the one man who could make the center hold . " <P> Using his monopoly over press and television , Saddam has apparently convinced large segments of the population that the ever hostile West simply used the occupation of Kuwait as an excuse to attack Iraq : they see themselves as the victims . Saddam also seized on Bush 's air strikes in January as evidence of Washington 's vendetta . Iraqi TV director Faisal Yasiri produced a series of 56 installments on the Gulf War that portrayed the country as a victim . " People discovered by watching the programs , " Yasiri says with a straight face , " that the target of aggression was Iraq . The liberation of Kuwait was only an excuse to attack Iraq .
