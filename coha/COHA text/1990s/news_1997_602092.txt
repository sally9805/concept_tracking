<p> CHICAGO  --  At 85 , Studs Terkel is preparing to sign off after 52 years on the radio , but he wants to make one thing clear : He 's not retiring . <p> " Retiring ? It 's not a word I use . Like they say in those old Westerns , smile when you say that . " <p> After making an art of interviewing haves and have-nots and popularizing oral history , Terkel has a new book out this month , My American Century ( The New Press , $ 25 ) , and a new job next year , the Chicago Historical Society 's Distinguished Visiting Scholar . <p> The bit about distinguished and scholar makes him uneasy , like forcing Terkel to wear a tie . But as he puts it , " Live long enough , last long enough and anything is possible . " <p> He moves to the historical society with 9,000 hours of tapes , a treasure of radio conversations with everyone from Tennessee Williams to Woody Allen , from Carl Sandburg to Maya Angelou , from Bertrand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these voices , " he says , " like Joan of Arc . " <p> The plan is to catalog them and make them available . It 's Terkel 's remedy for what he calls " the national Alzheimer 's disease possessing us . There 's no yesterday . " <p> " Those programs were built to last , " says George Drury , the former spoken arts curator at Terkel 's radio station . He recalls an interview with Martin Luther King Jr . at the home of Terkel 's friend , Mahalia Jackson , and another show with Langston Hughes reading his poetry to the blues of James Cotton . <p> Ever since Division Street : America was published in 1967 , Terkel also has been celebrated for giving a voice to the uncelebrated : farm workers and waitresses , neighborhood crusaders and former Klansmen , cops and con men . <p> Seven oral histories followed , including Working : People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do , which was made into a play . " The Good War " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotation marks are Terkel 's ) won a Pulitzer Prize in 1985 . <p> My American Century compiles highlights from his oral histories . In the foreword , Robert Coles calls Terkel " our foremost documentarian , our leading student of American variousness . " <p> It began with Andre Schiffrin , then editing Pantheon Books , suggesting Terkel do a book like Jan Myrdal 's Report From a Chinese Village , only his village would be Chicago . " Are you out of your mind ? " Terkel replied . Schiffrin persisted . <p> In 1990 , Schiffrin was ousted from Pantheon by what he calls " the financial people " at Newhouse , its corporate owners . Terkel loyally followed him to The New Press , an experiment in nonprofit publishing . Terkel 's Race : How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession was The New Press ' first book in 1992 . My American Century is its 200th . <p> The radio tapes are the other part of Terkel 's adventure with words and music that began as a kid at vaudeville shows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Time somersaults , as conversations with Terkel tend to do , to his " bleak years " at the University of Chicago Law School on the South Side and discovering what were then called " race records " of black musicians like Big Bill Broonzy singing , " Lord I 'm so low down , baby , I declare I 'm looking up at down . " <p> Bored with law , Terkel acted in radio soap operas , " usually a gangster who got killed off , " which in 1945 lead to a radio show , The Wax Museum , where he played Bach and Woody Guthrie and Bessie Smith , all on the same program , and began talking to musicians . <p> " One listener said it was like a conversation , and she was eavesdropping on it . I 've always remembered that . " <p> Radio led to TV in 1950 and a NBC show , Studs ' Place , a fictional cafe , with a pianist , waitress and Terkel as manager talking to guests as if they just dropped by . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Brecht would have roared . " <p> But his socialist politics got him in trouble in 1953 when the entertainment industry was cowed by Sen. Joseph McCarthy . <p> Terkel never met " a petition I did n't like . Anti-Jim Crow ? Peace with the Soviet Union ? I signed them . So this fellow from NBC flies from New York and says to me , ' You 're a valuable property . ' Valuable property . That 's what he said . And he tells me , ' All you 've got to do is say you were duped . ' ' But I was n't . ' And he says , ' Just say you were . ' <p> " And here 's the thing . To this day people call me a hero . But they miss the point . It was my ego . It was my vanity . To say I was duped is to say I 'm a fool . So he says the commies were behind what I signed . So that 's when I got cute . ' So if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it ? ' <p> " So finally he says , ' You 've got to stand up and be counted . ' So here 's what I do , " and Terkel stands up in the middle of his favorite Chinese restaurant where he 's telling the story 44 years later . " By then I knew I did n't have a job anymore . " <p> Blacklisted from TV , Terkel worked odd jobs , lectured about jazz and eventually returned to radio on WFMT-FM , Chicago 's classical music station , where he has been ever since , doing an hour-long show five times a week . After all these years , he still asks his engineer at tapings , " Did we take a break ? I get so excited , I forget . " <p> His nickname comes from James T. Farrell 's Chicago trilogy Studs Lonigan . His real name is Louis , but only his wife , Ida , a former social worker and anti-war activist , calls him that . Terkel 's friend , historian Garry Wills , says that after 58 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had a bigger FBI file . " <p> Terkel is all of 5-foot-5 . Having never learned to drive , he relies on the Chicago Transit Authority , as populist in his mode of transportation as in his politics . <p> Cast as a cabbie in the Jane Fonda movie The Dollmaker , he confessed he could n't drive . " So they got me a stand-in to drive the cab , the first time a bit player ever got a stand-in . " <p> In the baseball movie Eight Men Out , Terkel played Hugh Fullerton , the Chicago reporter who helped break the story of how the White Sox threw the 1919 World Series . Critics said Fullerton looked and sounded like Terkel playing Fullerton . <p> The voice is pure Terkel , a throaty kind of roller coaster of words . On radio , " I do n't interview my guests , " he says . " I have conversations . " The word conversation is drawn out , four full syllables , for emphasis . <p> Born a month after the Titanic sank , ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Terkel has n't given in much to old age . He uses a hearing aid and has abandoned cigars " except for a puff here and there . " But that does n't seem to bother him since " all the phonies in the world " took up cigars , " like the yuppies at the chophouse in town where they listen to Rush Limbaugh , " whom he dismisses as a " fast-talking comic . " <p> He recalls a young TV anchorman in Cincinnati asking him , " How about a bite ? " Terkel envisioned roast duck , red cabbage and some good German beer , but the anchorman wanted only 15 seconds of Terkel on tape . " I left very hungry . " <p> In his introduction to My American Century , Terkel quotes environmentalist David Brower 's advice to fellow elders who have lived out most of this century : <p> " Our young have n't lost their history . It was taken from them . . . . You 've got a file on this century , stored in your heads , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever again . Make the most of every molecule you 've got , as long as you 've got a second to go . That is your assignment . That is your charge . " <p> Or , as Terkel puts it , " As Fats Waller used to say , ' Give me another drink and I 'll tell you all you want to know . ' "
