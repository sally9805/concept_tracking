<p> Springfield , Mo . - Before Johnny Morris built plastic worm heaven at the edge of the Ozarks , this city had another unlikely claim to fame : cashew chicken . <p> A local restaurateur 's Chinese-American concoction of nuts over chicken never made Springfield a household name . But Morris ' angling empire did , at least in homes from California to Maine , where hunting and fishing have risen from mere sport to a conviction of culture . <p> Springfield , an otherwise nondescript southwest Missouri town , has become a magnet for outdoor enthusiasts . They make pilgrimages to the headquarters of Morris ' Bass Pro Shops catalog empire and its giant showroom , Outdoor World , a combination sporting goods store and amusement park . <p> By February , though , some enthusiasts may be coming to Atlanta instead . Bass Pro Shops plans to open a second Outdoor World in the former Fresh Festival market along I-85 at Steve Reynolds Boulevard near Gwinnett Place mall . <p> Officials expect the Atlanta store to become a major tourist destination . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas City Royals , the St. Louis Cardinals , the Gateway Arch or any other single attraction Missouri has to offer , state tourism officials say . <p> " It 's going to be fan-fantastic for our area , " said Willie Bentley , who manages a Holiday Inn and a Comfort Inn in Suwanee , eight miles up the interstate from the planned store . <p> " When this announcement was first made , we did not realize how important this would be for our hospitality industry , " said Bentley , who chairs the Gwinnett County Convention and Visitors Bureau . " The location in Missouri is bringing in people from outside the community by the thousands upon thousands a day . " <p> Tough competition in Atlanta <p> The Atlanta foray will be Morris ' first taste of direct competition with sports warehouses such as the Sports Authority and SportsTown . " Atlanta looks like it 's going to be tough in terms of competition , but it 's a big cherry in terms of opportunity out there , " Morris said . <p> Over the next decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ megastore s around the nation , a move that threatens to further bruise other big retailers on the sporting goods gridiron . But those in the business say there is a lot to go around . <p> Bass Pro 's target is the biggest chunk of the sporting goods industry . American retailers spent $ 3.9 billion last year to stock their shelves with fishing , hunting and camping gear . They bought only $ 2.19 billion worth of merchandise for a slew of other popular sports combined : baseball , softball , golf , tennis , basketball and football , according to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association . <p> But the secret to Outdoor World 's success seems to have as much to do with Morris ' showmanship as his array of merchandise and low prices . <p> Missouri tourism officials do n't dispute Bass Pro 's figures : Four million people crowd into Outdoor World every year - more than twice the number of visitors at Lake Lanier Islands and nearly half the annual draw at Underground Atlanta . <p> About 70 percent of those customers are from outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years - ever since seeing store promotions in the 30 million hunting and fishing catalogs that Bass Pro Shops mails out annually . <p> The biggest crowds come for annual hunting and fishing sale weekends , and once every four years , the company 's World 's Fishing Fair packs hotel rooms as far as 75 miles away and nearly triples Springfield 's population of 145,000 people . <p> " One of our major problems is where to put all the tour buses , " says Springfield Mayor N.L. " Mac " McCartney . <p> Jim DeBary brought his camcorder and family along on the eight-hour drive to the store from Hannibal , Mo . " I have a bunch of friends who come here all the time , " he said . " It 's amazing how much people like to fish . " <p> DeBary had promised to send a videotape of the store to his fish- crazy in-laws in Florida . " They are just the type of people to jump in the car and drive 1,000 miles to see it . " <p> All for a glorified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's billed as the world 's largest sporting goods store and they do n't have any concept of what 's there , " said Steve Kappler , a spokesman for the Missouri Division of Tourism . <p> Outdoor World 's 150,000 square feet is so stuffed to the gills that the store managers plan to expand into an adjoining warehouse to double the showroom 's size . <p> There are a thousand different models of fishing rods and every kind of accessory imaginable . An indoor firing range is so long it extends out under the fro nt parking lot . <p> All of which is easy enough to miss in a store big enough to house a four-story waterfall , a meandering stream with its own brood of live ducklings , a two-story log cabin , about two dozen bass and pontoon motor boats , a tin-roofed McDonald 's and a barbershop with chairs shaped like the fishing seats on ocean vessels . <p> Every wall , including the one beside the urinals in the men 's rooms , is decorated with a stuffed sample of nearly every animal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted flocks of geese and herds of deer , plus bobcats , a rhino , giraffes and huge bears . There are even the on-ice remains of Ethel , who recently abdicated her title as the largest living bass in captivity . <p> You can buy $ 1,800 carvings of wood ducks or a $ 110 framed luminescent blue mountain butterfly from Papua New Guinea . Or check out the wall of fishing tackle boxes or the aisles of artificial wigglers : disco worms in neon colors , hollow worms that float , Stud Fry and Triple Ripple worms , power grubs and fake crawfish . Bass Pro shares the rare distinction of keeping a standing inventory of 250,000 lures . <p> Televisions are positioned between showroom displays , playing videos of knee-slapping anglers and professional hunters giving away trade secrets . A pamphlet stand offers hot tips on selecting waders , slalom skis and winter underwear . Giant aquariums hold live catfish and bass . Another tank harbors saltwater creatures that eye diners in an upstairs seafood restaurant . <p> After an hour in the store , Diane Davies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband as he negotiated the fishing gear displays . <p> " Get this much junk in one place and people are going to come , " said John Davies , who decided to make a detour on the family trip to Wisconsin . <p> An economic generator <p> Privately held Bass Pro Shops does n't release total sales or profit figures . <p> A survey by Sports Trend , a trade magazine for sporting goods retailers , ranks Bass Pro as the industry 's 27th-largest retailer . The company 's retail and catalog operations rang up more than $ 160 million in sales last year , according to the publication . <p> Those figures do not include revenue from the company 's Tracker Marine boat manufacturing division , whose annual sales exceed $ 200 million , said Ron Fritz , Tracker Marine 's manufacturing director . <p> Morris owns a majority of Bass Pro , but he has begun seeking partners . <p> Two years ago , Brunswick Corp . bought " a significant minority " interest in Tracker Marine for $ 25 million , according to a Brunswick spokesman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers in metro Atlanta and manufacturing of Zebco rods , pleasure boats and marine motors . <p> Last year , Morris opened another marketing avenue by selling a minority stake in Bass Pro to Gaylord Entertainment Co. for $ 60 million . Gaylord owns the country music complex in Nashville that includes Opryland theme park , the Grand Ole Opry and the Nashville Network and CMT : Country Music Television cable networks . <p> The new partners will help put Morris on solid financial ground for his expansion into Atlanta and beyond , according to analysts who follow Gaylord and Brunswick . <p> Morris is already laying the groundwork . Bass Pro Shops is taking over a 1.7 million-square-foot manufacturing plant in Springfield where Zenith once built televisions . It is converting it into more space to warehouse merchandise for the Atlanta store . <p> The heart of Bass Pro 's operation , though - and the backbone of its chances for success in Atlanta - is its catalog operations . <p> Crammed in offices beside Outdoor World , nearly 100 operators take an average of 11,000 orders a day : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an eye on a deluxe reel cover , to an Ogdensburg , N.Y. , man looking for an electric air pump to a Grovetown , Ga. , customer ordering bait . <p> What Morris ' Bass Pro Shops and Outdoor World store bring to their community is n't taken for granted by Springfield residents . " He does hire when nobody else is , " said grocer Timothy Wommack . <p> City leaders say the company generates much of the annual $ 1.5 million in city sales taxes used to pave and fix streets , sidewalks and other city structures . <p> Take away Bass Pro Shops , and as far as tourists are concerned , Springfield is just a landmark for the interstate exit onto U.S. 65 and the short drive to Branson , Mo. , a little town that has grown into a mini- Nashville for the country music industry . <p> " It 's been a great plus for us , " said McCartney , Springfield 's mayor . " Johnny and his people are a big part of our community . "
