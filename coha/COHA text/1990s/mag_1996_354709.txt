In rare cases , such as parasitic wasps , creatures use each other for survival before one destroys the other . This is not unlike the current political morphology involving the genus Presidentum Candidatus , with those two familiar species , Robert Dole , Republican challenger , and Bill Clinton , Democratic incumbent . <P> Washington , as any biologist will tell you , is crueler than nature , and for the next few months rivals Clinton and Dole will find themselves in more or less intimate association , mutually dependent but wholeheartedly trying to annihilate each other . <P> For the next few months , the presidential campaign has shifted from the green fields of the Republic to the hard pavement of Pennsylvania Avenue .

" And he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane after wrapping up the nomination fight , Dole confided that he was " anxious to get back to work . " Back to work ? In other words , Dole was done moonlighting as a Republican primary candidate and now wanted to return to his real work , the job he knows and loves and does better than anyone else .
