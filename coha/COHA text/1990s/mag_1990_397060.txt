<p> WANT ABSOLUTELY PERFECT SERVICE on your next trip ? On every trip ? Just make all your hotel , restaurant , and travel reservations under the name " Andrew Harper . " <p> At least that 's what one enterprising traveler did recently in the Bahamas , capitalizing on the reputation of " Andrew Harper 's Hideaway Report , " the monthly newsletter which executives have learned to trust for its authoritative insights into pleasure travel . " To my knowledge , that 's the first time that 's ever happened , " laughs the man who calls himself " Andrew Harper " professionally , but who travels under his real name , one of the most closely guarded secrets in the travel industry . <p> " That 's so I can experience the hotel as a typical guest , " he explains . " If the hotel knows you 're from some publication  --  even if you pay your own way  --  the hotel tends to be on its best behavior . " Precisely what Harper wants to avoid in compiling his " connoisseur 's guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a touring pro is straightforward : " Anonymity breeds objectivity . " <p> Harper knows exactly who he 's writing for  --  an affluent clientele with little time to research new places . " I get so many letters , " he says , " which say , ' Just tell me what the best place is ; please do n't give me a choice between two . ' " He keeps the reviews in his slim , eight-page newsletter simple , writing in an amiable , informative style about the world 's premier hotels and resorts . <p> " There is no perfect hotel in the world , " Harper says . " Everyone thinks I could take the best of each and create the perfect hotel , but it just does n't happen . " Unlike such guides as Mobil and AAA , he has no quantified list of criteria , no automatic check-offs . " I 'm really looking for that ' Q ' factor , " he says , using TV parlance for desirability , " that intangible summary impression that instinctively separates the good hotel from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , you ask yourself at the very end , would I ever want to return to this hotel ? If the answer is yes , I will feature it . " <p> Harper is willing to overlook certain deficiencies , " if there is a high degree of personal service . " Not surprisingly , he feels the greatest service hotels in the world are in Southeast Asia  --  the Regent , the Peninsula , and the Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong , and the Oriental in Bangkok . The reason is simple : " Cheap labor . The staff to guest ratio must be two to one . And they intuitively sense what you want . " <p> The Ritz in Paris and the Stafford in London he mentions as providing superlative service in Europe , and a ranch near Darby , Mont. , called the Triple Creek Mountain Hideaway . " The staff there had a heart of gold , " he says , " and that 's what made the place . Greatness has nothing to do with the size of a hotel . " <p> Traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sun Valley , Idaho , he always spends at least 24 hours in an establishment in order to observe and experience a full daily cycle . His wife , he says , is an invaluable companion : " Women have a great feeling about staff ; they can pick up whether a feeling of friendliness is genuine . " <p> On the road , the 48-year-old Harper is n't exactly Everyman ; the places he 's staying in command hefty prices , usually upwards of $300 a day for a double . He laments the high prices that disgruntle his mainly American readership , and warns that the spiral will continue upward . " I thought prices had reached a limit , " he says , " but a lot of countries are saying that the Japanese and Germans will fill the void . It 's their turn to be on top with currencies . " <p> The way to beat some of those prices in Europe , he says , is to stay in hotels just outside of major cities . Instead of the historic district of Florence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scooters , Harper recommends the Torre di Bellosguardo , " a small hotel with a beautiful view of the city , in a centuries-old private park , " a five-minute taxi ride away . <p> The 12-year-old " Hideaway Report " is as exclusive as the places Andrew Harper writes about . Fine print at the bottom of the newsletter reads : " Worldwide circulation limited to 15,000 with new member slots determined by expired subscriptions . Approximately 125 openings currently available , " the precise number varying slightly from issue to issue . This " great marketing ploy , " as Harper somewhat ruefully calls it , actually happened by accident . After several years of publishing , a number of readers practically demanded that Harper keep the operation small . He then posed the question in his annual reader survey of whether he should , even if it meant increasing the price ( now $90 per year ) ; the response was overwhelmingly in favor . Although " it does n't make good business sense , " he says , " the exclusivity of it is probably another secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masses . " <p> Where , then , would Andrew Harper himself go if he wanted to play ? If , say , instead of visiting 31 hotels in 32 nights , he could decamp for a week or two ? <p> The Fattoria La Loggia , he says , in Montefiridolfi in the Chianti region of Tuscany  --  " where you can get a whole apartment for $1,000 a week for two in a remodeled Renaissance village in some of the most beautiful country in the world . " Or the Chateau de Vault-de-Lugny , near Avallon in the Burgundy region of France  --  " a nice , peaceful gem , 11 rooms in a converted old mansion , with a 13th-century fortress tower , which you can use as a base for touring all of Burgundy . It 's family-run , " for Harper usually a good portent . " Choosing between small hotels and large hotels , I 'd choose a small owner-managed hotel any time . " <p> Or Santa Fe , N.M .  --  " the oldest , most seductive capital city in America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Alameda is a perfectly situated bed-and-breakfast right down in the heart of things . " And the Triple Creek in Montana  --  where the minimum age is 16  --  " a stylish , personable ranch resort of luxury cabins and impressive amenities . It 's marvelous to have this feeling of luxury , and yet right outside your door you 're in the middle of nowhere . " <p> These are the antidotes to the places where " food poisoning is an appetizer , the service is dreadful , and the staff could care less if you were alive or dead . " He painfully recalls staying in a room in Wyoming reputed to be Buffalo Bill Cody 's , in the gunslinger 's original bed : " What they did n't tell you was that it was his original , hundred-year-old mattress . " Worse yet was French Polynesia , which , he says , " outside of Bora-Bora , is one of the most disappointing corners of the world . " <p> There , in Rangiroa , his experience was truly unforgettable . Rooms in his hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night and sweltered , or left them open and awakened to chickens scampering over the bedclothes . At dinner the thoroughly discontented guests were rebuffed in their requests for wine and uncracked china , until they noticed a table in a corner of the dining room . On an immaculate linen tablecloth a banquet was being set , with all of the niceties they were being denied . " Who 's that for , " Harper inquired . " Oh , " said a waiter , " we 're having in some travel writers and travel agents , and we 're really going to treat them royally . " <p> The supreme affront , says Harper , was that the visiting travel professionals were not even staying in the hotel they were purporting to recommend , but instead with the cagey owner . " So the public was getting the whole impression of a place that was totally skewed . " <p> Another disappointment , he says , has been Eastern Europe , currently the hot destination . " Fact is , it is n't wonderful . After 45 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sudden there 's a service industry ; they do n't know what a service industry is all about . Everyone says how beautiful Budapest is , and it is , on either side of the Danube River for about two blocks . " <p> Harper himself was one of the first to forego all-expenses-paid trips in the name of objectivity ; many travel journalists and some publications have since followed that lead . When preparing for a trip , he likes Fodor 's for background and major sights , and the Cadogan guides ( distributed in the U.S. by Globe Pequot Press ) , for the more obscure areas and smaller , country inns . In his own writing , he 's careful to observe the twin objectives of his newsletter : " not just news , " he says , " but a letter to a friend  --  a special rapport which maybe a magazine does n't have . " <p> Harper is careful to maintain the persona of a typical traveler ; he is not an ultra-streamlined " accidental tourist " with a thousand brilliant short-cuts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still overpack , " he confesses . But he points out that a successful gambit when making reservations is to request a room " away from the construction and renovation . What this does is to let you know if there is any construction going on , and give you the opportunity of choosing another hotel . " <p> If he could encourage American travelers to do one thing more often , it would be to complain . " People do n't complain enough , " he says . " If management is really worth their salt , they want to remedy any deficiencies . " How does he know this ? Because by May of this year , he had already received over 10,000 Of the pre-addressed hotel critique cards that he mails out with the " Hideaway Report . " " People do n't talk to the hotel manager , " he says , " but they will talk to Andrew Harper . " <p> With a renewal rate of 85% , Harper has clearly found the formula for success . And he is n't worried that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' Hideaway Report ' wo n't last , " he says , " because I 'll run out of hideaways . But most travelers stay with the big-name and cliche places . There are a lot of places in the world that are still undiscovered or right under one 's nose . " The Amenities Executives Prefer <p> Each September , Andrew Harper publishes his reader 's survey , collating the results of a questionnaire about lodgings around the world . His respondents are heavyweights : for a question pertaining to preferred room amenities , 77% of the 2,500 executives polled held the title of CEO/President/ Owner/Partner . <p> Harper was surprised by their preferences . " The results tell me , " he says , " that hoteliers had best concentrate on the basics of homey comfort , before dressing up guest rooms with a lot of fancy extras . " The top 10 of over 50 cited : Comfortable mattress Solid soundproofing Quality towels Thorough housekeeping Quiet air conditioner Comfortable bed pillows Morning paper at door Well-lit , spacious bath Efficient room service Good reading lamps <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing to Harper Associates , Inc. , Box 300 , Whitefish , MT , 5993 7 .
