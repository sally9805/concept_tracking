 | on the floor among the papers , not on the bed where she belonged with the lover , now . And what if the lover had walked in on them , he must have the key of the door , what change in direction would have happened then ? Vera was awarded the house in her divorce settlement and her lover Bennet Stark became her husband the day after her divorce was final . She gave up the wartime job she had had as secretary to someone in the set she had mixed with in her previous life , got herself articled to a legal firm and registered as a part-time law student at the university . There were no children of her previous marriage and , having lived with her lover in confident anticipation that they would be able to marry soon , she entered the second marriage already pregnant . The child ? it was Ivan  --  grew inside her , her lover was secured as her rightful possession , she was working and studying to fulfil the ambition she had been deflected from in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been hers since she was a schoolgirl . She sang as she lumbered heavily about the house . At night between the arms of her chosen man , with all the possibilities of her life envisioned in the dark , refrains of precise legal formulations she was learning ribboned pleasingly through her mind on the way to sleep . She saw her happiness as conscious and definitive . Once , in the first months when she was appearing in public with her lover as husband , a woman she did not know turned to her girlishly : Who 's that terribly handsome guy talking to the woman in the red dress ? ' He  --  hers . Sometimes when she woke before he did she would raise herself carefully on one elbow to gaze at his profile , the red bevelled scroll of his closed lips , the delicate hollow p 11 scooped beside the high bridge of his beautiful curved nose , the dear black shape his hairline cut against his white brow and temples , and , as if reflected , its blue shadow , the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf of jaw . If he stirred and the eye opened , black diamond mined from the depth of the subconscious , unfocussed , she suddenly was able to see him as the woman stranger had , existing in the eyes of others , her adoration  --  her luck  --  compounded by this . And there were times when , in the release of love-making , after the marvels he had first introduced her to in the mountains , caresses that had singled him out for her with an inked circle , Vera sobbed and huddled as if ecstasy were remorse or fear . Despite the extreme sensuality of his looks and the fascination it had for women , Bennet had not had much to do with them , inhibited by fastidiousness until he met this woman who , although so young , already had had the experience of marriage , abandoned a life , another man , chosen him . He understood that the passion she roused and they shared might find unexplained outlets of emotion through her ; he would soothe her gently , unquestioningly . But she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her distended breasts and swollen belly and between her legs so that he lost his head and they coupled wonderfully again , while he feared for the child tossed so wildly inside her . The baby was born strong and healthy . His mother 's gaze during his gestation had been so concentrated on his father that he might have been expected to be imprinted with his father 's Celtic or Semitic beauty ; but he came out favouring his mother , exactly , from his infant days ; in Vera 's image , alone . Mrs Stark is a fixture at the Legal Foundation . Although she has refused to take the executive directorship which has been p 12 offered to her , preferring  --  selfishly , she says  --  not to spend time on administration , no one can imagine the Foundation running without her . Her quiet acerbity at meetings , when she disagrees with aspects of policy ( and the fact that she 's so often proved right ) , her ability , sitting back with her head in its close-cut cap of white-streaked dark blond hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth sometimes tucked in ( the cleft could be expressing impatience or understanding ) to recognize and separate the truth , or as she would qualify , the facts from the fantasies born of poverty and powerlessness in applicants for the Foundation 's intervention  --  these combine to make her the colleague to whom everyone from the director to the telephonist turns for the last word . Nobody can con Vera , her colleagues agree with satisfaction . The Foundation is not a legal aid organization in the usual sense , it does not provide legal representation in the courts for individuals who can not afford to hire lawyers . It came into existence in response to the plight of black communities who had become so much baggage , to be taken up and put down according to a logic of separation of black people from the proximity of white people . A logic can be made out of anything ; it lies not in the truth or falsity of an idea , but in the means of its practical application . As part of their schedule of work for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the appropriate department and went off to bulldoze the homes of a community , pack the inhabitants and their belongings onto trucks drawn , like any other government equipment , from the State 's stores , and transport them to an area designated by the appropriate department . There they were supplied with tin toilets , communal taps , and sometimes , if these could he drawn from the stores department , tents . Sheets of corrugated tin might he supplied for them to begin building p 13 shacks . They might be allowed to bring along bits and ends left intact by the demolition of their houses  --  a window-frame or mine boards  --  but cows and goats had to be left behind ; what would the beasts feed on , in a stretch of veld cleared and levelled for the barest human occupation ? All this process was perfectly logical , Mrs Stark would remind her colleagues ; we have to come to terms with the fact that in the Foundation we are not dealing with the only real means , to defend these people , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into practice  --  we are not tackling that at all , at all , let 's not kid ourselves  --  we are only grappling with its Teal consequences , looking for the legal loopholes that will lay or frustrate or  --  occasionally  --  win out over that logic . They would smile in appreciation of her hard-headed sense of ' , portion , quite difficult to keep when confronted with the sort trusting wretchedness facing them in supplicants every day . Now that the Act that put the Idea into practice has been dished by the beginning of political defeat of that power , the inundation has not , as might be expected , become redundant . Mrs. Stark was not entirely right  --  or rather she and her colaura , absorbed in pragmatic strategies while the Act was in i. , had no time to think how far beyond its old promulgation I logical enactment , beyond its abolition , its consequences ' Id become yet new consequences . Now communities whose oral the Foundation had been unsuccessful in stalling are mg to present the case for having restored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken from them and allotted to whites . The same old men in stained worn suits , taking off a in hands that seem to be uprooted from earth , sit on the sale of the interviewer 's desk . There is the same patient alertness needed to listen to the tale and , while it is being told , a where , out of desperation and guile , it is omitting some-  | thing the emissary thinks might prejudice his case , where it is being exaggerated for sympathy , and where the facts and their truthful interpretation are the strength of the case , something to work on . Although Mrs Stark is the one who prepares the yearly report for publication  --  it has to be both comprehensive and persuasive , because it goes out to existing and prospective donors  --  and she sometimes travels abroad as a fund-raiser , she does her share of interviewing and investigation . Nobody can con Mrs Stark , no . To some she seems forbidding  --  and what white person , who among all those whites who still have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come into what you are now told is your own , is not forbidding , still there , on the other side of the desk , just as before ? But although with her discouraging coldness she does n't patronize these applicants struggling to express themselves in English  --  the language of the other side of the desks  --  and although she does n't try to ingratiate herself chummily , as many whites feel obliged to do , with the blacks among her colleagues , she has  --  how to categorize this ? ? connections with some of these colleagues that have come about rather than been sought and even , over the years , with individuals who to others would be scarcely distinguishable from any in the endless trudge of dispossessed in and out of the Foun-dation 's premises . The young clerk named Oupa will saunter into her office eating from his lunch packet of chips or takeaway of curried chicken , and sit there , sometimes in easy silence while she reads through notes she 's taken in an interview just concluded , a silence sometimes broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yoghurt . He 's studying at night for a law degree by correspondence and started off by coming to ask her for an explanation of something he did n't grasp ; it was her very reserve itself that in his naivety made him think she would be  | better qualified to give him the right answers than any of the other lawyers on the premises . She was the figure of the schoolmistress missing in his lonely self-education , she was the abstract image of authority that , resented all your life or not , you had to turn to in your powerlessness . Then he began to talk to her about his four years on Robben Island , seventeen to twenty-one . It was everyone 's prison story , of his kind and generation , but lie found himself telling it differently to this white woman , not censored or touched up as he was drawn out to tell it to other whites eager for vicarious experience . He broke off and returned to it on other days , remembering things he had forgotten or not wanted to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and warders , but also the distortions in his own behaviour he now looked back on . Sometimes with disbelief , talking to her , sometimes with puzzlement , even shame . There was the comradeship , the real meaning of brother ( as he put it ) . ? But you suddenly hate someone , you can hardly keep your hands off his throat  --  and it 's over nothing , a piece of string to tie your shoe , one time a fight in the shower about whose turn it was ! And the same two people , when we were on hunger strike , we 'd do anything for each other . . . I ca n't think it was me . What did she say ? He was a gentle person forced , too young , to see another version of himself that it needed only violence against him , degradation in suffering the lack of humanity in others , to bring to life . She did n't console , did n't assure him that that individual , that self , no longer existed . ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box on her desk with a gloomy tilt of the head and the answering tilt of her head said it was not necessary to ask . He was wiping chicken-wing-greasy fingers . She passed him the waste-paper bin , dropping her apple core into it on the way .  | Oupa doubled as driver of the Foundation 's station-wagon battered by the lawyers ' trips into the backveld to consult with communities under threat of removal . One day when Mrs Stark 's car had been stolen he gave her a lift home , and the theft revived something else . Before he went to the Island , he was awaiting trial on the mainland in a cell with criminals . ? Murderers , man ! Gangsters . I can tell you , they were brilliant . Nothing to touch them for brains . The things they 'd brought off  --  robberies , bank hold-ups . And they 'd play the whole show through for us . Exactly how they did it . Prison means nothing to them , they had the warders bribed and scared of them . Even whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for when they 'd done their time . I tell you , those guys would make top-class lawyers and big businessmen. ? He grinned , chin lifted as he drove . Again Mrs Stark was comfortably silent , if she noted , she made no remark on what he had just innocently confirmed : something of the unacknowledged self that came into being in prison still existed within him , a pride in and defiant community with anyone , everyone , who had the daring to defy the power of white men , to take from them what was not theirs , whether by political rebellion or by the gangster 's gun ; silent because this was a self that , by nature of what she was , could not exist among her selves . ? You ever come across any of them again , outside ? Oupa pressed his elbows to his ribs and brought his shoulders up to his ears . ? Those people ! Man ! Je-ss-uss ! I 'd be terrified. ?  | Vera left her promising position in a prosperous legal firm after , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second child was born , Annick . She has never known whether her first child , Ivan , is the Non of her divorced husband or of Bennet Stark , her love of whom was ringed indelibly on a photograph . No one else will ever know that she herself does not . He of the sun-grained , fairskinned nape is now living in Australia , retired from something to do with shipping , and has nothing around him to bring to the surface that last visit he made to the house they had once shared ; and if , in the mood of male camaraderie on a drinking evening there is an exchange of confidences about the unpredictable sexual behaviour of women , he contributes the example of an ex-wife who gave him a better hour than she 'd ever done during the brief marriage , he is unlikely to think there could have been any consequences  --  she was accustomed to see to that . Perhaps he might feel a momentary stab of betrayal , despite her complete betrayal of him , at mentioning her more or less in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all so long ago . . . As for her present husband , it 's unthinkable that ever there could be be- p 18 tween them one of those terrible , embattled stages of marriage when she might thrust her hand down into their life to seize a weapon to wound him mortally . Ben was almost embarrassedly dismissive of the fact that his daughter had inherited his beauty ; part of the quality of that beauty was that he was not aware of it , he was brought to see it only by remarks upon the beauty of the baby girl as the image of her father . Ivan  --  because he reproduced the face of his mother ? ? remained Ben 's favoured child . When the girl was born , with the marvellous markings of her father 's black hair and double fringe of lashes , even the bevel-edged lips , Vera could have been looking in a mirror where her lover from the mountains was preserved as he was as a child . A tremendous gratitude gushed from her along with the expulsion of the afterbirth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby with the tender emotional fervour of one making amends  --  for what , to whom , was diffused in maternal energy ; from which she looked up , only now and then , at the newspaper headlines announcing arrests , trials , bans , finally the outlawing of political movements . Physical fulfilment is a temporary withdrawal from the world , a sealing-off from threat and demand , whether directed to oneself or others . At the time , it seems the other world , all extraneous , is jabber and distraction , a crowded station passed through , train blinds drawn and compartment door locked . The self-absorption was pierced only by the fact of the baby shot dead on its mother 's back at Sharpeville  --  an infant like her own , like Bennet 's . Her life was all touch : during the day the smooth plumpness of her small daughter damply warm against her hip , the hands of her leggy son , roughened and scratched in tussles at play ; the caresses of love-making . There could have been a biological explanation for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory  | that after giving birth women experience fresh sexual initiatives and responses . They had been married for twelve years ; whatever the reason , the feast of sex begun as a picnic in the moun-t ains again preoccupied her and her lover-husband as it had done . Intelligent people as they were , while they discussed what was happening around them he could be distracted by the bare cup of her armpit showing in a sleeveless dress , and she could be conscious of the curve of his genitals enticing under his jeans . Bennet Stark carved wood and modelled clay but while recognition for his work in this vocation seemed long in coming had had to make use of a conventional degree he had earned when too young to know what he wanted to do . Bennet Stark was known , behind his back at the Department of English in the university where he worked , as Our Male Lead ; as if he were responsible for his looks and the mixture of resentment and admiration these aroused . From the point of view of advancement in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage that is simply a gift of nature , not earned and not attainable for others by any amount of hard work , lobbying or toadying . He remained in a junior position and the ambitions the lovers had for him as an artist when first they exchanged confidences beside a mountain stream were in abeyance while they concentrated on each other and the extension of themselves in their children . He still modelled in clay occasionally over a weekend  --  the heads of the children , which were growing , changing , even as the clay hardened the image of one stage or another , and the naked torso of Vera , anonymous female body to anyone other than himself , who supplied the beloved head in his mind . Hut married to the woman he had captivated and captured and the father of a family , he had given up the idea of becoming a sculptor . Vera , at least , had attained her easier ambition of qualifying in law . Lovingly , he felt no jealousy ; hers was a prac- p 20 tical goal , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , protected by sensual happiness , he came to accept he perhaps did not have enough . When Annick began to wriggle out of her arms and Ivan distanced himself from the need of her touch on childish wounds , Vera appeared restlessly displaced . She told Bennet she was going back to work . They could certainly do with the money . ? I 'm not going back to the firm . He did not know what to make of a sudden announcement that overturned all assumptions . ? I do n't want to fight their insurance claims when they lose their jewellery and Mercedes . Or dig the dirt in their divorces. ? He looked at her tenderly , patiently . ? Set up on your own ? - -I do n't know . Vera read newspapers and reports , White Papers , was drawn to people who were spread-eagled between their private attachments and those other tentacles , the tug of others ' predicaments , the tangle of frustration and misery ; women , as she was a woman , lifted out of the humble ramshackle of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , as hers was a man , endorsed out of a town where they might find work , driven off farms where their fathers had given their labour ; children unlike hers because there was no childhood for them , begging and sniffing glue for comfort in the street . She did come to know . She went to work at the Foundation , not out of the white guilt people talked about , but out of a need to take up , to balance on her own two feet the time and place to which , by birth , she understood she had no choice but to belong . This need must have been growing unheeded  --  seed shat by a bird and germinating , sprout- p 21 ing , beside a cultivated tree  --  climbing the branches of passionate domesticity . Population removals were being fought everywhere to the limit of the Foundation 's resources ; she was working until midnight at home as well as all day at the offices ; Bennet had left the university and , with a partner , opened a market consultancy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , they talked over for hours the disappointments , worries , resentments and compensations each had gathered during the day , giving one another advice , putting together the context , from his experience of one level of society and her experience of another , their life . Mr Tertius Odendaal had three farms , one inherited from his grandfather through his father , one that came as his wife 's dowry , and one that he had bought in the agricultural boom times of the early Eighties . With America and the British  --  even the Germans who had once been supporters of the war in which his grandfather was a Boer general  --  interfering in the affairs of the country , embargoing oil supplies , boycotting sports tours , encouraging the blacks to make trouble so that even his ignorant farm boys were no longer reliable , he began to think about looking to the present , if not the future . With the old stern President pushed out by one of his cabinet who smiled like a Alm star and was said to be having talks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . Not twenty kilometres across $hr veld from his homestead there was a black homeland . He had had to put an electrified fence round his kraal to protect his Holsteins from thieves , after one of his watch-boys had been 66.11441 in a panga attack . Even the old President had dumped blacks too near white farms . On one of his other farms  --  the one p 22 bought when there were good rains for his maize crop and beef prices were high  --  that he used only for seasonal grazing , he found squatters , although the herd-boy who had his women and umpteen children with him in his outpost of mud and thatch huts lied that these were just his family , visiting . He told the herd-boy to clear out , get off the farm and take his hangers-on with him . But next time he drove to inspect the place with one of his other boys there were fluttering sheets of plastic and leantos of cardboard , tin roofs held down by stones and old tyres , thrown up on his veld like worm-casts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men would have been away at work or loafing somewhere , even as far as town . He got his boy to warn these people with an harangue in their own language : what were they doing there , they must pack up their rubbish and get off his land immediately , if they were not gone by tomorrow he 'd bring the police . A tiny child clutched his penis in fear and drew up his cheeks to whimper . The women stood unblinking or turned away . As the farmer 's bakkie lurched and swayed off , one screamed something the herd-boy did n't translate to the farmer . The cry trailed in the wake of the vehicle . Mr Odendaal decided to move with the times ; whatever they might be . What the Government had done , was doing , could not be undone by one Afrikaner alone . Fighting its betrayal of the white farmer was something for which political action would be found . In the meantime , farmers would have to  --  in the busi-nessmen 's way of speaking ? ' diversify resources ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tricks that make those people rich . He applied to the Provincial Administration for permission to establish a black township on one of his holdings . He would convert the farm into cash as a landlord ; he would divide it into plots for rent to blacks . He was going to turn their invasion to profit . p 23 During the year pending the Administration 's decision  --  the application appeared inr the Government Gazette and there were ponderous objections from farmers in the vicinity ? 1,500 squatter families representing approximately 26,000 people took possession of Portion 19 . These figures for the Odensville squatter camp ( it must have got out among the squatters that Odendaal had thought to commemorate the family name in his township ) were ascertained by a field-worker of the Legal Foundation , to which a man who presented himself as the spokesperson of the squatters had appealed for investigation . A station-wagon with a tide-mark of dust and a windscreen dashed with splattered insects drew up at the Odendaal farmstead . Odendaal sensed at mice it had been through the squatter camp that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with white-streaked hair cut like a man 's , speaking the usual badly accented Afrikaans of English-'speaking townspeople , introduced herself there on the stoep as ? Mrs Stack or Stock from the Legal Foundation . At the pronouncement of that title his body shifted in reflex to bar the front door ; that body would not let her past into his house . She actually had with her the man he had refused to meet , whose existence was a matter for the police to deal with - the black bastard who put up that crowd of criminals , drunkrds , and won't-works on his land to talk about rights ' they never would have had the nerve to think of . She introduced the man and even the driver , also a black , as if she expected that she two blacks would be received as part of her delegation and greeted as visitors . She ignored that the farmer did not respond . Mr Odendaal M11r Odendaal that . Polite and talked so you could n't get a word in to stop her . ? We 've come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be distressing for you , do n't think the p 2 4 people there do n't realize this . I 'm one of the Foundation 's lawyers and  --  we know from experience  --  the worst aspect of this sort of situation is when the farmer feels he 's accepting it if he should agree to talk to the other parties concerned . The Odensville people have a spokesperson , Mr Rapulana , and I can assure you that neither of us is here to deny your position ( changed to English , not knowing how to put that sort of sly lawyer 's phrase in Afrikaans ) . We 've come because it 's in the best interests of everyone . . . believe me , I 've seen it , solutions can sometimes be reached where there has seemed no possible way out while the only communication is the threat of police action . . . Mr Odendaal , I hope you 're going to talk to us , Mr Rapulana and me  --  oh this morning or whenever it suits you  --  we 're going to hear each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of woman who produced a revulsion in him . To him , in fact was not a woman at all , as he knew women , even if she had been young he could never have believed a man would want to touch a woman like that , would never have thought there were breasts you could fondle in the marital bedroom dark , the mouth asking questions and addressing him without the respect and natural deference due to a male , yet offensively quietly , could bring the sensation of a woman 's tongue in your mouth . He made her wait . He was looking over her head as if she were not there . He spoke in Afrikaans , since she thought she would make herself acceptable by trying to speak his language . ? Daar 's Been Odensville se mense nie ! Odensville is my township that 's not yet declared , nobody is living in Odensville , nobody ! All those people are trespassers and the only thing I 'm going to tell you , lady ( the term of address emphasized , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run off my land , I 'm going to burn down their rubbish , and you can go back yourself and tell  | them I 'm not just talking , I 'm not talking at all to you , I 've got the men to do it with me , we know how to get it done , all right , and if they want to get in the way , that 's going to be their funeral . Running to you wo n't help them . There are no Odensville ' peo-ple ' , so you can forget about calling them that . They 're nothing , vuilgoed . This meddling woman  --  lawyers , they call themselves ! ? stood calmly , even the twitch of something like a smile at the side of her mouth , as if waiting for a tantrum to spend itself .

The man 's Afrikaans was Odendaal 's , not Mrs Stark 's pidgin . ? Meneer Odendaal , do n't be afraid . We wo n't harm you . Not you or your wife and children . The woman lawyer touched the man 's shirt-sleeve ( dressed up like a gentleman , jacket over his arm ) . Before she led the way back to the station-wagon she paused persistently . ? Mr Odendaal , I apologize for turning up without telephoning . I 'll be writing to you and probably will be able to explain the Foun-dation 's assessment of the situation more acceptably than I 've been able to do now . The farmer turned his back . He opened his front door and slummed it on them behind him . In the optical illusion of blotchy explosions that comes with leaving the glare of sun for a dim hallway , he , too , paused a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his property .

Rural rack-rent , and we 've no legal recourse . Exploitation is the other name for the law of supply and demand , my darling. - - Maybe . Maybe . In the situation of people with nothing . 11 lien it comes to land . Pocket calculators , deodorants , vodka brands . . . the stuff I 'm consulted about  --  the greater demand you create the greater the competition and the less chance of getting away with exploitation . Ile spoke in irony but without resentment . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of Vera 's was something that , as with other couples of their kind , of their place and time , was unremarked in their intimacy , ' port of an accepted ambiguity . For so long this had been a place and time when integrity in many matters could be maintained Ottly by dishonesty , when truth had to survive by lies . If Security ( Itself a euphemism for threat ) came to ask where so-and-so was  | living , you said you did not know , and , out of necessity to protect yourself as well , might even put Security off on a plausible false trail . If you were going to be a conduit for letters addressed to certain destinations that risked being intercepted by agents at the post office , you hired a mail-box under a fictitious name in a suburb far from where you lived . If there was a rumour that this one or that among acquaintances was suspect as a police plant , you smilingly dissimulated before the person but no longer talked in that company about anything you believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against association with someone who perhaps was innocent , a name smeared by yet others to cause dissension in your ranks . These were the only ways to defend at least something of the truth against the ultimate lie , the only way to defend the principle of life struggling against death , which is the ultimate , forgotten etymology , not to be found in any dictionary or political speech , of that embarrassing word , freedom . So while Vera 's Foundation upheld the right of land and shelter , the object of Bennet 's market research consultancy was to discover for his clients the enticements that distract people from what they really lack . But  --  again , wait ! ? is n't there another , everyday , popfreedom , broadcast everywhere in shops and elevators and the combis which transport everyone in cities and on country roads , an easy-to-use freedom in the choice of buying the beer that champions drink or the hair-relaxer beauty queens advise ? Must people forgo the pleasure of the unnecessary , as well as everything else they do n't have ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the university , he would have been teaching a curriculum devised for the level of general education and Western cultural background of white students , difficult to attain for the black students who satisfied entrance standards nominally but came from township schools where boycotts were their history thesis ,  | running battles with the police their epic poetry , and economic theory that of a home where there was n't enough money for bus fare , let alone books . So what was the difference , whichever way a failed sculptor might earn a living ? In some blessed peaceful country , existing far away , an obvious moral contradiction in the activities of a man and woman might destroy the respect that goes with love . But here , for these two , while the great lie prevailed , it was part of a shackle of common experience of what was wrong but aleatory , could not be escaped . They were scarcely aware of its chafing . When Oupa had driven two or three kilometres from the Onelendaal place the little party from the Foundation stopped on a side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took along on such trips a flask and a packet of biscuits , sugar in a jar , and a stack of plastic cups . Most welcome , the Odensville man said several times , sitting with his knees neatly together , on the grass . Young Oupa crunched one biscuit after another and every how and then , irresistibly , shook his head and laughed on a full mouth at the encounter they had left behind them . ? I know that man . Yoh-yoh ! I know him ! That kind from the Island , orders just like him . There was one commandant  --  stood there like a bull in front of you when you came up for interrogation . Never spoke himself , let the other one question you and rough you up , but just standing there he was in charge . If he had n't been there , they could n't have done the things they did to you . And every time I thought , now it 's coming , now he 's going to start in on me , too . Yrr-ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just had to he there. - Mrs. Stark ran her fingers through her hair , a commonplace mow ruffling its feathers , and yawned , the yawn turning into  | a smile , the pleasure she always took in the young man 's ebullience , his awesome way of dealing with his terrible experiences in the indiscriminate narrative style in which he would gossip of something pleasant or funny . The soft red road was empty except for a distant stick-figure zigzagging on a bicycle just below the horizon . The tea was hot and sweet . Beyond a barbed-wire fence where wispy beards of sheep 's wool were caught , veld grasses and weeds streaked in undulations of green woven to bronze and rust where a declivity in the ground had been swampy in summer . Black-and-white plover flung themselves up out of the grass as if they had been thrown , crying out on a single note at human presence . After the battering of responses and emotions in the exchange with the farmer , the irritation and exasperation repressed  --  and who knows , neither Mrs Stark nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? calm and quiet fell upon the three as a common bond . After this one unremarkable manifestation of that conflict which rang and babbled about them , in them , a constant garbling of their different lives ? suddenly the swallows of hot sweet tea were their only awareness . The paper-flutter of white egrets lifting the sky , the gauzy sleeves of water trailing from irrigation faucets in a vast field of something barely there , barely green ; the three rested on the land : this was what it was , not a wrangle in a cross-fire of saliva on a stoep , not folders of documents citing deed , claim and proclamation in the files of a Legal Foundation . Oupa wandered off to pee behind a tree . Mrs Stark , unconcerned about the dignity of her maturity , climbed through the spiky fence with the skill of one used to improvise and found a bush for herself . As she squatted there so privately , the flit of insects in the sun above her head made her drowsy , as if they were some pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flick of transparent wings , there/away , she felt she was about to lie down on  | the damp rough grass and dream something she had forgotten . She came back to herself and through the fence again . The Odensville man was still sitting as if at a church meeting . ? What about you ? But if he understood the brisk reference to the humble call of nature he perhaps thought it an embarrassing familiarity on the part of this woman , from whom he expected the formulations of the law . He dusted the elbows of his jacket as he rose , asking whether she would mind dropping him at a store nearby , he had to see someone . He got out of the station-wagon there , taking off his hat . ? I 'll be contacting you when I have any news , good or bad . You have my phone number ? Yes , keep me posted if there are any developments . One of us 'll come out again some time next week to take statements  --  if you could get some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had used for the farmer , a lawyer must not identify with the anxiety of a client any more than a doctor can function effectively if he begins to feel the pain of his patient . A day or night when Vera heard , like a phrase recurring front a piece of music once listened to and out of mind : Meneer Odendaal , do n't be afraid . We wo n't harm you . Not you or your N'i/v and children . She separated the three statements . Meneer Odendaal , do n't be afraid . ( Meneer Odendaal ) We wo n't harm you . ( Meneer Odendaal ) Not you or your wife and children . She thought that she had not heard them aright on the stoep at day . The farmer heard them and Rapulana the Odensville p 32 man heard them the way she did not , they understood what was being said . The words of tolerance and forgiveness so strangely coming from the Odensville squatter dweller , shaming her for the crude aggression of the farmer , were not tolerance and forgiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thousands on Portion 19 , our Odensville . We are there across the veld from you , every night . You have dogs , you have a gun , but we are thousands , and we can come across the veld to this house , this house where you and your wife and your children are asleep , and , as you said about us if we do n't go from Portion 19 , that 'll be your funeral .  | You do n't know who this is ? On her way in the city , coming up to the street from the underground garage where her car had its regular booth , a creature within its range of burrows walking the block to the Foundation from the bank , a coffee bar where she might have joined a friend or the Italian restaurant where occasionally she and Ben , in the observance of a forgotten retreat for clandestine lovers , met for lunch , Vera sometimes found herself stopped by Morneone who was searching for recognition to come from her . You do n't know who this is ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkened and puckered beneath the eyes , the saucy jut of dancing buttocks now built into a monument of solid , middle-aged flesh ; a figure of a man with one tired shoulder lower than the other , *billing pink dome where Vera would have recognized only the hail blond curls , another whose belly-fat , straining gaps between ? birt buttons , had swallowed the slender black Jonah ( that really happened to be his name ) she and Ben had hidden from the police in Ben 's office before he fled the country  --  who would ass eet a market research consultancy of harbouring one of the p 36 leaders of the uprising in ' 76 . Some had come from their years in prison , some were the first of those returning from exile . As they talked , hands grasped , sometimes embracing , the double embrace first clasped round this side of the neck then that , which everyone in the liberation movement forgot was derived from the embrace of dictators , Vera and these old acquaintances and friends were giddy with discovery , the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't remember me ? The past is known to be irretrievable . But here that proposition is overturned . In the euphoria of being back , of presenting themselves alive , resurrected from the anonymity of exile , of these who have returned , and the eager desire of those who have stayed at home to make up , in welcome , for the deprivation of exile they have not suffered , people who had had reason to distrust or simply dislike one another and people who once had been close as brothers and sisters are all greeted in the same way as cherished returning heroes . It is something of the same phenomenon as young Oupa 's lively accounts that do not discriminate between terrors he has experienced and the everyday gossip of the Foun-dation 's personnel . A convention came instantly into being , as conventions often do , to serve where it seems established patterns of behaviour do n't . Yet beneath it , under the disguise of flesh , behind the sunken eyes , within the clothes of a foreign cut , the black leather caps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab keffiyeh worn as a scarf , the old events and circumstances exist ; standing there in the street , the old dependencies , the old friendships , the old factional rivalries , the old betrayals and loyalties , political scandals and sexual jealousies were not gone for ever but persisted in evidence of traceable , ineffaceable features , visible cell structure , still living . The past was there . p 37 Perhaps because of the break in continuity this was so . If the satin skin had been seen slowly bruising dark with age and heavy drinking , if the blond curls had been observed , in the course of ordinary encounters , thinning , if Jonah had been heavier , maturing each time he dropped in for talk and a beer with Ben , the changes would have wound away naturally in the reel of years . But there was no tape running between the state of being they had been in when they left for exile or prison and their sudden reappearance back here where they had left : the weight their lives had was the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who had stayed behind . The man whom experiences had bowed to one side and shorn of his hair turned up at Vera 's office to see if there might be something for him  --  a research job , anything ; he had been back three months and could not find work . He had been a journalist on an often-banned small paper when they knew one another long ago . While she tried to make some suggestions , where he might find employment and  --  she had to offer  --  she would be able to put in a word for him , there lay between them the knowledge that he was  --  had been  --  suspected of being a police agent at one time , and when he fled the country , although apparently cleared of this suspicion , he was mixed up in some schismatic defection . This was what he was , to her ; she did not know whet her he had been reinstated among the exiles abroad and whether or not he had returned with the status of one fully acceptedl within the Movement  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw that that persona might have inveigled by nee subterfuge the status to return under indemnity , supposedly vouched for by the Movement . But if there were ambiguous feelings subsuming the enthusiasm of welcome and the obligations it carried , there was also overwhelming sense of good times impossibly restored . p 38 Among the people who were returning were some the sight and sound of whom , their very mannerisms and turn of phrase , were proof that such times are carried along within the self . When a railway line is abandoned , the tracks are n't taken up . Under weeds and grass , they remain , marking a route . For the Starks , with Sibongile and Didymus Maqoma suddenly sitting in the Starks ' living-room again after more than twenty years , there was the unexpected warmth and understanding , across the conditioned inhibitions of colour , between couples sharing youth and the ties of children . Now again , in the presence of Sally and Didy , the Starks were the lovers in an affair continuing in the protection of domesticity , expansive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not seen Ben as the woman at a party once had , his male allure , for a long time , had not even been aware , in her familiarity with him and her preoccupations , of not seeing him . He , Bennet Stark , was still there , with only the deep lines from the corners of those lips to that fine jaw to mark him , as if in the conduct of his life he had sculpted his own face . She exchanged again with him the side-glance smile of complicity , displayed the coquetry of joking reproaches that claimed him as hers , the recognition of his judgment in quoting him on this matter or that , which was the atmosphere the young couples used to generate between them . The class difference set by white privilege had been rather less than was usual between whites and blacks . Didymus was an articled clerk then , in a law firm , as Vera had been a few years before , Sally ran a black cooperative and ambitiously attended the extramural classes Bennet taught at the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met  --  through Bennet , and made the discovery that there was a link in that both their partners had chosen law . Of course , Vera had the house that had come to her with divorce , p 39 and the Maqomas lived in Chiawelo , Deep Soweto ; Didymus carried a pass . But the Maqomas , both politically active , even then had open confidence that they would be among those who would destroy white privilege sooner or later , and pragmatically made use , as of right  --  and this was recognized unembarrassedly by the Starks  --  of the advantages the white couple had . It was more pleasant to pool the children in the Starks ' run-wild garden on a Sunday than to have the Starks over in the two-roomed Chiawelo place , although the Stark couple enjoyed breaking the law of segregation , from the comfort of their side , by coming at night into Chiawelo to listen to jazz recordings  --  Didymus was a collector and himself played the trumpet in those days ! ? and drink and perhaps dance , bumping into Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same living-room in the manic house where the four of them had been together so many times , talking across one another in the same animation . The Maqoma boys might have been there , in Vera 's house , as they often used to be , come to spend the weekend , Ivan might have liven there , sharing his schoolboy room with them , and , clown Ilse passage , the disdainful small girl , Annie , against whom they aged up . It was not nostalgia Vera was experiencing on such ocea-n 's , but something different : a sense of confrontation with interpreted life kept about her , saddled on her person along with the bulging shoulder bag always on her arm , her briefcase documenting inquiry into other people 's lives . Didymus Magoma , whose whitening curls sat like the peruke a seventeenth - century courtier worn stately on his black head , ' I %era Stark with the haircut of a woman who has set aside p 40 her femininity , in this joyful reunion of friends gave no sign , even to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two had seen each other . One Saturday morning five years ago Vera , alone in the house , had answered a ring at the door . A black man with a scanty peppercorn beard round lips and chin , wearing thick glasses and the collar of a clergyman , stood there . He did not speak , or before he could , she gave her usual response to anyone in the racket of purporting to collect church funds . ? Sorry , I 've nothing for you . The man smiled . ? How mean of you Vera . It was long before the encounters in the street where people waited to be reassured by recognition , to have confirmed the claim that they were back . There were no indemnities , there was no lifting of bans on political movements . The last thing the man looked for was to be recognizable . To be recognized was to be hunted . Didymus , he said . As if she had dropped up to the neck in a pit alarm for him engulfed her . She took his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did not need to be told that he somehow had been smuggled into the country , and that he had a purpose about which she must not ask . Her nervous amazement broke hysterically . ? Umfundisi ! You look so funny ! No  --  no , you look dead right , that kind of Sunday suit , and the collar frayed , where did you get kitted out so perfectly They were both grinning with emotion . ? We have our network in the shops down Diagonal Street . One week I 'm a labourer with cement on my shoes , torn overalls and a woollen cap down to my eyes , next week I 'm in a three-piece blue with a white cap , a soccer promoter from Jabulani . They were walking through the house , weaving about each other , she was out of breath . ? Are you all right ? Do you think they know ? p 41 ? No , so far it 's okay . But I ca n't stay in the same place too long . I ca n't stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbours want to be nice to me , I have to disappear . Move on. - - I 'd heard you were ill , you had something awful-l eukemia ? ? you were being treated in Moscow. - - Yes , that 's right , I 'm out of action sick in Moscow . I 've been here six months . She was looking at him , head on one side , thrilled by the audacity . ? Six months ! They were in the kitchen , she was distractedly picking up cups and putting them down , turning on her heels to rummage in a drawer for spoons , forgetting whether she had or had not switched on the kettle . She talked fast at him , as if the house were surrounded and at any moment there would be a hammering on the doors  --  and what would she say ? Where would she hide him ? She tugged the kitchen curtains across the window . ? D' you need money ? how do you manage , I mean . I have n't much in the house , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , they close early on Saturdays  --  but how stupid , I can use my card at the ma-chines- ? Money is one thing I do n't need . That 's taken care of , thanks , do n't worry. - - Does Sally know ? - - That I 'm not dying in Moscow , yes . But not where I go . An 'd other comrades in London believe I 'm sick . She was shaking the coffee jug to make the liquid drip more quickly through the filter , she did n't know whether she wanted to get rid of him or take him and hide him away . ? Ben 'll be home soon . Wonderful for him to see you . Ca n't believe it ! But I 'm so afraid for you , what they 'll do to you if they catch you p 42 ? you could just disappear , you know that , they keep infiltrators in solitary for months under interrogation , months and months before they piece together enough to bring them to trial . If they ever do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tranquilly breathing in the aroma of coffee steam , adding another spoon of sugar like a poor man making the best of luxury . But coaxing irony surfaced from his own identity : ? You 'll defend me , if I come to trial , Vera , I count on you. - - Lot of use I 'd be. ? What would she do if the police did come , what if they were waiting somewhere hidden in the street , sitting in a car , ready to take him as he walked out of her gate ? ? I hope Ben wo n't be long. - - I must go before Ben comes . Vera , there is something I do need . I 've got things here I want you to send overseas for me . But not by post . If you have someone , if you know someone who 's flying out and wo n't ask questions  --  they can post them somewhere in Europe , does n't matter , anywhere . She took the letters and a package , claiming trust , not necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , a rush of rejection of fears swept her , she walked out with hire into the street , they were ambling together in full view of neighbours , police , anybody who might be witnessing them from watching houses , the eyes of windows , crossing and rounding the corner in the middle of the street where they could not fail to be seen , arm in arm to where , for discretion so that it would not mark her house , he had left a car . And there they embraced goodbye : the open stare of the street fixed on them . If no one finds out , it 's as if it never took place . It was not the first time Vera had experienced something she never revealed . Only five years of silence had passed this time ; but Ivan was more than forty years old . So it comes about  | that the precedent of lying by omission becomes a facility that serves a political purpose just as well . Sibongile and Didymus Maqoma regained their names when they came back . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be many people in the outside world who would know them by no other . Addressed by these names , they would react  --  answer  --  to them as they would to the names given them , attached as an umbilical cord to the location outside a coalmining town ( Sibongile , daughter of a Zulu mother and Sotho father ) and the steep hut village folded in maritime hills ( Didymus , in the Transkei ) where they were born and first answered to a name at all . They did not go back to the little house where they were young  --  probably a slum by now , with the crush of people doubling- and tripling-up for somewhere to live  --  unthinkable to live in Chiawelo , anyway . They spent the first few weeks in it I lillbrow hotel that had been taken over as a reception centre for returning exiles . It had been a drinking-place for working class white toughs and their women , and the cheap orange carpeting was stained with beer and pitted with cigarette burns . Stretched tapes on the music diffusion system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sibongile *tripped the beds to look for vermin . She felt them on her skin , sleepless , although they were not there . The plane-loads of returning exiles who were arriving every few days were awaited at the airport by chanting and dancing crowds ; when they came through the automatic doors that closed behind them on the old longing for home , when they emerged pushing squeaking chariots charged with the evidence of far places , carrying airport store giant teddy-bears , blind with ex-  | 4 citement in the glare of recognition  --  not , at once , of who they were individually but of what they stood for , the victory of return  --  a swell of women 's ululating voices buffeted them into the wrestle of joyous arms . Children seen for the first time were tossed from hands to shoulders , welcome banners were trampled , flowers waved , bull-horns sounded , the hugging , capering procession of transit to repossession , life regained , there outside the airport terminal , was a carnival beyond belief it would ever be possible to celebrate . Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pyrotechnic display of emotion for those who come from wars , banishment , exile , who have forgotten what home was , or suffered not being able to forget . The Maqomas of course had not come on one of the crowded charter flights and their reception was less flamboyant though no less emotional . Didymus was a veteran of the inner circle in exile , one who for all those years had been involved in international missions and certain other important activities , and they were met by comrades equal to him in rank within the internal organization . A car was waiting for them , driven by one of the young returned Freedom Fighters now deployed as Security men . Home . They slept , that first night , in what used to be a forbidden white suburb at the house that had been acquired for one of the most important leaders . But it was understood they could not stay ; the room would be needed for other transients in the to-and-fro now established between representatives from the Move-ment 's missions in other countries . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supply of Kleenex , a television set , a room where bags were never unpacked . Until a house or flat could be found they would have to live in a hotel ? there was , in fact , a hotel provided for just such an unavoidable interim . Sibongile came to Didymus with a blanket held draped over  | her raised palms . He had no idea what for , but was always patient with her sense of drama . ? I ca n't live like this. - - What is it ? A crust of something whitish-yellow dried in a smear on the hairy surface . ? What is it ! ? Her rising laugh , a cry . She thrust the evidence at him . ? Oh . That . Yes. ? Semen , someone 's seed . ? I ca n't live like this , I can tell you. - - Sibo , you 've lived much worse . It did n't kill us. - - At the beginning , years ago , yes . It was necessary . In Dar , in Botswana . But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . I 'm not running from anybody any more , I 'm not grateful for a bit of shelter , political asylum ( the blanket dropped at her feet , her hands lifted , palms together in parody of the black child 's gesture of thanks she had been taught as a little girl ) . 1This 's not for you and me. - - What can they do about it ? They ca n't find accommodation for everyone overnight . Give it another week or so . . . - - Accommodation . How long can we be expected to carry on in this filthy dump , this whore-house for Hillbrow drunks , is wonderful concession to desegregation , what an honour to sleep under the white man 's spunk. - - What about all the others living here . . . it 's no better r them. ? He was confronting her with herself , as she was rry time she entered the foyer of the hotel or walked through room smelling of cockroach repellent that was the restaurant , ' bracing unknown women , men and children in the intimacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screwing up her eyes and opening her ' nth , lips drawn hack , mimicking the expression of someone p 46 straining to hear aright . ? If you 're happy to come back to this from your meetings of the NEC , your big decisions , no complaints . . . - - How can I have complaints when so many have come back to nowhere at all . At least we have dirty blankets . She ignored the smile . ? And how does that help them ? It was Vera Stark to whom she suddenly felt she could unburden herself ; the farce of self-sacrifice when it was not necessary might have to be kept up with the wife of the leader in whose house she and Didymus had spent the first night , but Vera , while counted upon to understand perfectly the necessity for such tactics within that circle , was outside it . There were whites who had been in exile , but Vera had not ; there were whites who shared the wariness of return , Vera was not one of them . Unburden to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , place responsibility on her . When Vera answered the telephone with the usual cheerful how-are-you , there was a pause . ? Lousy. ? And then that cry of a laugh . Vera , good old Vera , did n't make the usual facilely sympathetic noises . ? Let 's have lunch today . Have you time ? - -I just have to get out of this place . On the site of the small restaurant where young Vera and her wartime lover had sat longing to embrace , the place now transformed into a takeaway outlet with additional vegetarian menu and tables open to all races , Sibongile was first to arrive . Her crossed legs were elegant in black suede boots draped to the knee . ? I love those boots . London boots . Vera had the generosity , towards women who still make their appearance seductive , of a woman confident that she , was once successfully seductive herself and now knows she may only p 47 occasionally , and in an abstracted way , herself be merely pleasing . The two women kissed and each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greet one another with a mock punch . ? Do you ? Yes , London . I suppose they give me away . They ordered a meal . Vera , whatever was the special for the day ; her guest reading up and down the menu and asking for what was not on it  --  fish , was there no fish ? The waiter smilingly patient , addressing her respectfully as mama , persuasive in what he somehow correctly divined was their shared mother tongue that this dish or that was ( back to English ) very , very nice , tasty . Vera read the message of the fish . Lousy ; everything lousy , not even possible to get what you wanted to eat . With the waiter gone the required time had passed for her companion to be able to speak . She described the hotel  --  the accommodation ' she kept calling it , by turns derisive , angry , disgusted , despairing , and  --  being Sibongile , Sally  --  giggling sharply . ? But Didy ! I do n't know , he seems ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quiet , nibbling at whatever 's given to him . That veteran of prism-is and interrogation . That fox at inIt ration , raiding under the eyes of the police and army . They laughed at the notion . ? I 'm telling you ! He seems to be living in the past , a time warp , we 're still some sort of refugee , we must suffer in noble silence  --  for what the cause does n't need any more . While he 's meeting members of the Government , for God 's sake ! The Boers fawning all over us , inviting us to official dinners , getting themselves photographed with us for the papers ! But he wo n't tell anyone on the NEC , straight out , we must have something decent to live in if we 're to function properly at that level . They 're p 48 never going to find anything , that I know . We 'll have to do it ourselves . . . I 'll have to do it . . . but in the meantime ! That flea-pit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you know I do n't like dogs . I never dreamt I 'd think back on our basement London flat and the one we had in Stockholm , those grey days  --  my God , I do . So Sibongile and Didymus Maqoma regained the personae of Sally and Didy , the code names of their old concourse with whites . They came to stay with the Starks . ? Ben , you should just see the Hillbrow dump ! Not just the dirt Sally goes on about . . . people sit around in the bar lounge watching television all day long , sprawled there sucking Coca-Cola , nothing to do and nowhere to go . She 's years from that kind of slum atmosphere , even though they 're her own people . . . she and Didy have moved away from that cheek-by-jowl existence they were at home in , the old days , Chiawelo . Ben defined the element exile had , at least , brought into the Maqomas ' life . ? Privacy ; they 've had it in London for years , now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was invaded for the five weeks Sally and Didy lived with them . Their own relationship was at the stage when the temporary presence of others was revivifying . They had an extra bathroom ; that was the only condition of middle-class existence that had any importance for them . Sally and Didy 's late-born daughter , Mpho , arrived from her school in England . She stayed indiscriminately , a weekend here , a week there , between her grandmother 's house in Alexandra township and the Starks ' house , sleeping in the bed and among the curling pop-star posters and odd trinkets that had survived their daughter Annick 's adolescence and absence . Thy ? Maqoma daughter was a sixteen-year-old beauty of the kind  | created by the cross-pollination of history . Boundaries are changed , ideologies merge , sects , religious and philosophical , create new idols out of combinations of belief , scientific discoveries link cause and effect between the disparate , ethnically jumbled territorial names make a nationality out of many-tongued peoples of different religions , a style of beauty comes out of the dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a time when this had not yet been achieved by governments , conferences , negotiations , mass action and international monitoring or intervention  --  of the struggle for power iii the country which was hers , and yet where , because of that power struggle , she had not been born . This schoolgirl combined the style of Vogue with the assertion of Africa . She was a mutation achieving happy appropriation of the aesthetics of opposing species . She exposed the exaggeratedly long legs that seem to have been created not by natural endowment but to the specification f Western standards of luxury , along with the elongated chassis f custom-built cars . The oyster-shell-pink palms of her slender Mauls completed the striking colour contrast of matt black skin with purple-red painted fingernails . Her hair , drawn back straightened and oiled to the gloss of European hair , was gathered on the crown and twisted into stiff dreadlocks , Congolese style , that fringed her shoulders . Despite all this , Mpho did not have the aspirant beauty queen 's skull grin but a child 's smile great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth came perky London English . She could not speak an African language , neither the Zulu of her mother nor the Xhosa of her father ? Oh but I understand , mother dear , I can follow ? And she would open her eyes wide and roll her head , appealing to high heaven in exactly the gesture of the mother with whom she was arguing . Yes , but who knows you understand when you never  | answer , people will think you 're an idiot , my retarded child . You 're going to have lessons. - - Well , that 's pretty humiliating for you , ma , is n't it  --  have your daughter taught our language as if it 's French or German or something . Sally appealed to their hosts , Vera and Ben ? Listen to that . My girl , that is exactly what has been done to our people , you , your father , me . We 've been alienated from what is ours , and it 's not only in exile . Your father 's descended from a great chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you have a name to live up to ! You were robbed of your birth  --  that should have been right here . Take back your language . The schoolgirl gave a smile of complicity with the witnesses to her mother 's emotionalism , dealing with it in harmless insolence . ? I 'll learn from my gogo. ? She giggled at her use of at least one word in a mother tongue , but was too shy or perhaps defiant to admit that she was serious about the intention . It was of her own volition that she left the guest room so well suited to her age and comfort and often went off to stay with her grandmother in Alexandra . After the first duty visit of respect required of a son 's child , Sally had not expected the girl to go back again soon , let alone pack her luminescent duffle bag and spend days and nights there in the house with its broken-pillared stoep and dust-dried pot-plants , battered relic of real bricks and mortar with two diamond-paned rotting windows from the time when Alex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , imitated , now standing alone on ash-coloured earth surrounded by shacks , and what had once been an aspiration to a patch of fenced suburban garden now a pile of rubbish where the street dumped its beer cans and pissed , and the ribcages of scavenging dogs moved like bellows . How could a child brought up with her own bedroom , fresh milk delivered at the p 51 front door in Notting Hill Gate every morning , tidy people who sorted their newspapers for recycling , be expected to stand more than one night in such a place , gogo or no gogo ? Going out across u yard to a toilet used by everyone round about ! Heaven knows what she might pick up there ! A return to a level of life to which Sibongile , Didymus , had been condemned when they were their child 's age  --  what did a sixteen-year-old born in exile know of what it was like when there was no choice ? The distress is something that can be conveyed to someone other  --  Vera  --  but a kind of pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself the dismayed humbling of the mother by the worldly child 's innocent level of acceptance : the sense that she knows what home is . Mpho moved between Alexandra and the house that came from Vera 's divorce settlement with an ease that charmed the Starks . At the Starks ' , along with her parents , she met and mingled with the Starks ' friends , Vera 's colleagues from the Foundation the protege Oupa and the lawyers . The young peogot on well together , Mpho was carried off to parties with these youngsters her relieved parents knew were decent , no drugs drunkenness ; through a contact of one of the lawyers , the Maqomas found exactly what was needed , a small house in a suburb near the school where , again with the help of scone met in the Stark circle , the girl was accepted to complete levels . The day after they moved in with nothing but rowed beds , Sally , taking the car the Movement provided for drove along the street of local shops to look for secondhand furniture , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ municiple cleaner , a woman sweeping the gutter-muck into a drain . She did n't know that women did this work , now . Well , any job was better than nothing , these times . It could be that of those she had known in exile , the fighters in the training  | 2 camps , might end up sweeping streets ; the probability gave her an internal cringe , the drawing in of her stomach muscles that was involuntary when she confronted herself with the responsibility in which she was engaged : she had just been appointed deputy director of the Movement 's regional redeployment programme , at present a collection of research papers emerging at the pace of stuttering faxes . As she locked the car ( forewarned since the day of arrival of those for whom theft was better than nothing ) she saw that the cleaner had not moved on , was leaning on her broom and looking at her , a woman dressed ridiculously in the handout of bright protective overalls , football stockings rolled round her calves , flat-footed in men 's shoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her head . Begging ? She would give her a greeting , anyway : Sawubona , sisi . The woman did not approach but spoke excitedly . ? Sibongile , when did you come ? I 'm Sela 's child , your mother 's cousin , you remember ? From Sela 's house , you used to see us there , in Witbank . Wakened suddenly , shaken alive into another light , another existence . Sally is drawn over to her other self , standing there , the one she started out with , this apparition with a plastic bag tied over the hand with which , deftly , it picks up dirt the broom misses . Home . In the streets of Johannesburg , on your way around the city , You do n't know who this is ? Even Oupa managed to move into a white suburb . Why did his white colleagues at the Foundation use , to themselves , the prefix even ' ? Because once the legal restriction " they campaigned against were lifted there remained an older , even ( yes , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 53 The clerk was decently paid by the decent standards of a Foundation that was non-profit-making not only in the money sense but also the human one , providing the same benefits of medical are and pension fund for all who worked there , from the director to the cleaner . But the rent of apartments in the area where he wanted to live was beyond his means . In one way , he was like any other young man in training for a professional career ; a stage when it is assumed the youngster has as yet no responsibilities , has emerged from school , free , to a few years of chasing girls and enjoying himself with his male peers . Starting out in life , the saying goes . But of course this one 's start had been delayed so long , he had queued up unable to get into schools , dropped out into political action , spent four years on Robben Island , that before he could start on the lowest rank of a career he had acquired the responsibilities of maturity . Oupa was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time as he was the Foundation 's bright protege . For him the business of ' growing tip had not been , could not be , followed in recognized chronology . Of course Oupa had a wife , somewhere , of course Is. ' had children . His decent salary was diminished by the rent , the food , the clothing to be provided out of sight , for the anachronism of his life . The wife and children lived in another part the country , with relatives who were dumped by the Government in some resettlement area . The eager apprentice was in fact an adult already trapped by adult desires , conflicts and responsibilities . The Foundation was more than tolerant of the time he took from work to find a place , a bachelor home among them in at had been the streets where only whites could live . They red for him on his daily journeys to and from Soweto by In ; he could be knifed by gangsters or thrown out of the window to his death by political thugs . Mrs Stark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , to telephone around among friends who might know of vacancies or have influence with estate agents who were wary about letting to blacks ; it was someone else in the office who found a lead that resulted in the young colleague getting what he wanted . He was elated , although the rent was too high for him to afford ; untroubled , although he had signed a lease restricting occupancy to two people , and he was going to split the rent by sharing the place with a couple and their two children . Oupa planned a house-warming for everyone from the Foundation . Mrs Stark , to compensate for not having been any help to him in finding somewhere to live , offered to contribute homemade snacks and left with him a little early on a Friday afternoon to help with preparations . ? Where do we go ? ? Oupa had mentioned enthusiastically to everyone an area where there were numerous apartment buildings but had given no further details . He named a street and chattered on . ? It 's an old building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , big rooms and everything . Here we are  --  here it is . Delville Wood . ' ( Look at that real marble entrance ! ) Something to do with a war , is n't it ? The car came to a standstill neatly against the kerb . ? Delville Wood. ? Walking up the steps under packages loaded between them , Mrs Stark turned to him , an odd smile accompanying the banal scrap of information she was giving . ? Yes , it 's a battle . Where it happened . He thought there was some unhappy connection with the name he 'd ignorantly blundered on . ? Someone you knew died there ? But she laughed . ? That war took place before 1 was born. ?  | He led her along red-polished corridors . Her eyes counted off the numbered doors as they passed . ? That 's it ! In his proud moment , she pronounced before his doorway : - One- Twenty- One . He rapped zestfully on the number and echoed her . ? One-'wenty-One Delville Wood . In the living-room two junk-shop chairs covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a fancy copper ashtray , and an old box trunk covered with a piece of African cloth . Everything faced the glaucous giant eye of the television set . ? Of course it 's not fixed up yet . Pictures and so on . I need desk and something for my books . I 'm going to do a lot of ork here , man ! But nice , aih ? - -A desk over there at the window . . . Ben might have one n could use . Yes , this is a lovely room . Ile had switched on the television , it was a children 's proattune with the squeaky voices of anthropomorphic animals but he slid not notice , it did n't matter , the gesture was that of session , he was at home in these walls where only whites had ed before . - Come and see the rest . Talking expansively , he led her to a room with a double had made up under a fringed bedspread with three cushions Doped diamond-shaped against the wall . ? I might put the It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . After for work. ? He was assuring her of his seriousness about dying ; after all , although she was a motherly friend , she was one of the seniors in the Foundation that employed him . second room : a chaos of clothing , toys , pots and pans , hot- p 5 6 plate standing on a triple-mirror dressing table , cot filled with jumbled shoes . ? They 're moving in . Oupa went to fetch from the car the folding chairs borrowed from the Foundation and when he returned Mrs Stark was in the kitchen unpacking what she called the goodies . He stood about : ? I have n't got the hang of the stove yet ? But she had opened the oven door and taken out fat-encrusted shelves , she tried the plates one by one , knowing exactly how everything worked , I 'll show you , she said , just as she calmly and quietly would explain to him some legal question he would bring to her from his correspondence course . He was flattered that she concentrated on the preparations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance to get everything right , to think of nothing else until this was so . He felt Mrs Stark knew what this occasion meant to him , even if to others it was just another office party . The extended family of the Foundation arrived . Husbands and wives , permanent lovers of this sex or that , the other half of unexplained attachments . There was the bonhomie of the special set of relationships between people who work together and find themselves at play , their joking in-house references that others might not follow but which raised the general level of celebration . Somebody 's boy-friend had brought a guitar and he sang his compositions in a mixture of Zulu , English and Afrikaans to a group that stood about or sat with their drinks on the fringed bedcover in the bedroom , while in the living-room nobody was listening , the talk and laughter at a higher volume than the music . Mrs Stark 's hot cheese puffs ran out . She and several others from the Foundation were back in the kitchen opening cans of Viennas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband arrived late and had brought along a carrier of wine and beer . With a knife in one hand and the greasy other hand held away from contact with his jacket , she p 57 dropped what she was doing and went over to kiss him for the thought . He almost backed in surprise , then held her shoulders a moment ; it was so unlike her to make a show of affection public . His contribution to the party hardly called for any special mark of gratitude ; perhaps she 'd had a few drinks  --  well , why not ? The promised desk was picked up from the Starks ' house and delivered to One-Twenty-One Delville Wood by a friend of Oupa who borrowed a bakkie from another friend . Oupa bought  --  computer , on credit , to complete the equipment ; the only problem , he remarked to Mrs Stark some weeks later , was that the friend who transported the desk had moved into the flat with him , the couple , and the two children . ? He 's got no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's working here in town. ? Soon this friend , who had agreed to contribute to the rent , was joined by another , workless and penniless . This came out when Oupa , bringing his lunch as usual into Mrs Stark 's suffice , relieved by talking to her his anxiety about not having fulfilled that month 's correspondence-course assignments . ? He also slept in the living-room , with my other friend . On the floor , but better than nothing , aih ? But now the other people are fed up they say they 're paying for sharing the sitting-room and he 's always there , lying around . And does n't pay . So now he stays with me in my room and when I want to study at night he 's talkking to me all the time . Man ! Till midnight , one o'clock . What could she be expected to say ? Tell him to find somere else . ' Where else ? Were n't she and the young clerk surrounded by the papers , right there under crumbs from their bunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , still had nowhere . She offered what she knew was useless , indignant at exploitation of him by his peers ; he could have been her son . ? Oupa , you have to be firm . You 're too soft . If he could move in with you , there must be someone else he can go  | to in the same way . You ca n't be expected to live like that . Now you 've at last got a place The young man swallowed a mouthful and sagged in his chair , blowing out his cheeks . He shook his head , again and again , in denial of the pressure of her attention . ? He was with me on the Island . He bit again into his chicken leg and chewed . She held her cup in both hands and gulped tea . ? Oh god . Wha'd'we do . What 's his line of work , ca n't we find something for him. - - Worked in a dry cleaner 's , a box factory , I do n't know ... he has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattled a pen against her cup . ? Why do I have to open my big mouth ! Why do I have to open my big mouth ! ?  | Passing . Passing down the street . Driven by countless times so that the destination it once meant has been obliterated , layer upon layer , by errands taking that route . At first , for months , halted at a traffic light , staring up at the closed windows of the flat as if into the eyes of someone who gives no sign . Then there was someone else 's washing on a laundry stand on the balcony . A dartboard hung on the wall below where the bathroom fanlight looked out . That was when the letters stopped ; or only now did the image seem as signalling that other dispossession ; the end of such experiences in reality comes much more slowly , the drama of parting , repeated in variation  --  the end of touching , the end of talking on the telephone , the lengthening gap between letters  --  it 's over-rehearsed and so the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positively last appearances . Here we are . To stop outside the entrance , to hear the name spoken by a stranger to the site , is simply the quiet ripple of a smile : Delville Wood . This is it . Walking along the corridors , same concrete p 6 0 slippery-polished ochre red , a mixture of fascination and a sort of dread . After all , the mail-boxes in the foyer are numbered through six floors , the new kind of tenant could have been leading along another corridor to another number . Even on this floor it surely must be another number . But no , more and more impossible , a coincidence against odds of six floors of flats , One-Twenty-One . The door opening on locked feelings ; the coming to life as fascination and dread is the old sexual anticipation of walking along the red-polished corridor to enter One-TwentyOne . Amazing : the sensations are pleasurable , as if the one who had been there at the desk before the window will get up to press himself against her or in the sleepy surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slide in , shivery-naked beside him  --  as if he were going to be there , was there , in the return of the desire he had created in this living-room where the great eye of the television set sees nothing , in this bedroom where a new , poor young tenant makes his bed . The motherly friend is helpfully surveying the needs of the new kind of tenant . She is briskly preparing the dirty stove to warm up her provision of snacks . The evidence that she knows her way about this kitchen as if she lived there is attributed to the general familiarity of women with the domestic domain : I have n't got the hang of the stove yet , the new kind of tenant says , apologetically male . What you have done once you will do again . Sometimes Vera had reminded herself , sneered at herself , jeered in reproach ; but this did not stop her . She felt resentment at selfconfrontation with this evidence of what , when she was a child , her mother termed ' behaviour ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the one with whom she had slept while her young husband was fighting a war , expecting to p 61 come home to her . Bennet therefore would be for ever in the category of lover , the one chosen above the sexual bond and moral ties of marriage , even when he became husband . That was how it was for how long ? Again , the reality comes at an unnoticed pace , in the brief human time-span of one life the equivalent of the smoothing of the thumb on a holy effigy by centuries ' homage of those who kiss the hand . Bennet became Ben . The skill of his love-making became satisfaction to be counted on . She could not believe she was being strongly attracted to another man ; Ben , Bennet was the other man . Yet in a way it was he who made another man possible , wanted , because he it was who had shown her , up in the mountains with those friends of a group photograph , what love-making could be , how many revelations of excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought was its limit , with the husband who was out of the way at war . If Ben had taught her that the possibilities of eroticism were beyond experience with one man , then this meant that the total experience of love-making did not end with him . The understanding of this , in her body , must have been there for years  --  logically , ever since she first was made love to by him ? But it remained unaccepted or dormant until , somewhere in her forties , oh when her hair was still abundantly glossy , not a single broken vein showing a red spiderweb on her legs , a man came to the Foundation to film an interview on its work for a documentary he was making about forms of resistance in the country . He left his card to join those of other visitors to the Foundation who imagined they might be contacted again , though what for , politeness forbade asking . Otto Abarbanel . The surname was one she had never heard of ; he worked for an Austrian television network and spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was solemn going about his filming and formal in manner , like Germans she had met . He telephoned her several p 62 times and came back to the office , apologizing for disturbing her , wanting to verify this information or that , and when she realized these were ' pretexts she was at first amused to find she did not find him a nuisance . Then , that afternoon , without any transition from formality , he grasped her fist where it was resting slackly on her desk , covered it tightly in his own . She placed her other hand over this grip . And so suddenly , there was a covenant of desire . Will you come and see me , he had said , to make it possible to seem that some professional appointment were being discussed , there in the office where anyone might come in upon the atmosphere the gesture had created . ? For coffee on Saturday afternoon . Vera and Ben were busy people who did not need to account to one another for every movement . He had invited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was tranquil , serving at table , unbelieving of what she was going to do , and in the same state of mind went to the bathroom after lunch and fitted into her body the rubber device that had prevented her from conceiving since the birth of Annie . She left Ben and his visitor with an apology  --  she had to put in some duty appearance at a political gathering . She had many obligations of this nature and her husband looked up from his preoccupation , giving the goodbye-go-well salute that was their customary private signal before other people . And when she came home later in the afternoon it was as she could never have imagined it could be , what had happened in the three hours ' interim was something that concerned her alone , her sexuality , a private constant in her being , a characteristic like the colour of eyes , the shape of a nose , the nature of a personal spirit that never could belong to anyone other than p 63 the self . Bennet Stark stood in a doorway once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed in a relationship with the woman to whom she remarked on his male beauty ; that unknown woman was demonstrating a truth Vera now euphorically believed she had only just discovered ; sexuality , in his case displayed guilelessly by nature in the sensuous allure of his face , was a wholly owned attribute , could not be claimed by the naive bid : He 's my husband . Now Vera saw herself in that doorway . She lay beside Ben that night with a sense of pride and freedom rather than betrayal . During those two years there was no yoghurt and apple lunch eaten over papers at the office . She fled , whenever there was an interstice in activity there or at home , whenever her absence would not be noticed or when there would be some reason for it plausible to her colleagues , her husband , her adolescent daughter ( Ivan was already living in England ) ; fled to number One-Twenty-One . The duplicate key she was equipped with hung with her car and house keys on the ring with the bluebird medallion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the daughter . She let herself in . He was there or was to be anticipated . Sometimes he arrived with the kind of food he liked  --  herrings or smoked sausage or cold Kasseler ribs  --  and they ate together in that kitchen before or after making love . They bathed together before going back to other people , soaping each other  --  why was it no one , least of all women , would admit the tender pleasure of handling like this a man 's slippery soft tube , pressing it a little , playfully , to make it grow , palpating , rounding out the shape of the two eggs , often uneven in size , in the pouch that keeps warm and alive the seed of the young , akin to the physical attribute that belongs , in the animal species , to the female kangaroo with her pouch of unborn young , quaintly p 6 4 reversed in the human species to the other sex , the male ; the pouch that is anciently wrinkled , as if about to atrophy , even in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Vera . Vague about his age perhaps because he wanted to forget the age of his lover . But when , in talk , she made references he was too young to remember , the attempt to catch up , the momentary blankness in his expression , was obvious . He had a high forehead tight , anxious , shiny-skinned , like that of a rosy apple , was not goodlooking ; in fact , Vera did not know what he really looked like , if the face is what one is ; she knew the body , the cruciform male body with its line of light brown curly hair branching up from the navel into a crossbeam at the nipples , following the dominant shape from the narrow hips and widening with a splendid thorax to the shoulders . His face was the disguise that bearded men all wear ; dark shaggy-blond growth curled round his mouth and gave its own shape to whatever his chin and jaw might be . Thickrimmed glasses protected the expression in commonplace blue eyes as if they were seen through the distancing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lower lip the same fullness , she associated with dissatisfaction with self , and generally found unattractive in other people . In him , surrounded by that seaweed beard , it was to her one of those fleshy creature-flowers in rock pools , sensitive to the temptation of the slightest touch . Not only had she thought she never could be attracted to another man ; she had been sure she would never be attracted to another blond man . So it was this foreigner who exorcised for her some residual resentment  --  and resentment remains always damag-ing  --  that must be surviving against the first blond , the wartime husband . She wanted to tell Otto this odd fact , a confession surely endearing if not flattering to him , but did n't because she sensed that references to that war , at the end of which he was p 65 a child , made him uneasy  --  for herself , she had no embarrassment at being so much older than he ; verifying critically in a mirror , she knew there was no mark of ageing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first few times she had visited One-Twenty-One , This wo n't last long , you know . He misunderstood what she was telling him : that he could n't count against Ben , although she was free to choose both of them . He thought she was referring to the limit of his working assignment in the country . ? I 've got a surprise for you  --  I 've applied to be stationed here , the channel 's correspondent for the region . They were getting dressed . He did not know what to make of the way she dropped her hands at her sides . He came over and bound her arms with his , bending his head to bury it in her neck . Alongside the success of managing clandestinity there was in her a wish to take her foreigner home , to introduce him to her life , so that he might know her elsewhere than behind a desk or in his bed . She rationalized : if he were invited to the house occasionally , as both she and Ben would naturally bring home a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of someone drawing other conclusions should she and Otto happen to be seen together somewhere . Otto was reluctant to come to Vera 's home , to enter her life in which he had no part . But he acknowledged she must be a better judge than he in the situation . There were other guests , some of them blacks he had met in the course of his filming of trade union officials and minor political figures , and there was the husband , an impressive man , very skilful in pleasing the guests in unison with his wife , the two of them managing the gathering . The wife : that 's what she was , in this house . He was p 66 introduced , also , to her daughter , who quickly disappeared from the parents ' gathering that no doubt bored her ; beautiful , but exactly like the father . So there was nothing to trouble him as evidence , in a younger version of herself , that his lover had faded in the years she had lived ahead of him . With the chat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned he had n't had much chance to talk to the young German , what was his name again ? A strange name ; giving it , she asked in innocent-sounding interest what its origin might be ? Ben was so well-read , had a memory for all kinds of esoteric knowledge that never came her way . ? Abarbanel ? But that 's an old Sephardic name , must be a Jew , not a German. - - I think he 's Austrian. ? She was enquiring . ? Could have been born there , I suppose . Jews 've been dispersed all over , so long . Who knows . Who knows . And so it was her husband who roused her curiosity . An erotic curiosity . In the dreamy confidentiality after love-making , she spoke to her lover . ? So you 're a Jew . Someone told me your name 's Jewish . Sephardic . That 's Spanish , is n't it. - - It has a Spanish origin but the Jews were expelled from Spain in the fifteenth century. - -I would n't have known you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be circumcised. - - I did n't have the usual sort of beginning and I was sent away quite young with other orphans and adopted , I grew up in Vienna with those people who took me . People of Sephardic origin , somewhere far back. - - What about your own mother and father ? He turned so that their profiles faced one another on the pillow . ? Dead. ?  | She would ask no more : the Gestapo round-up , the closed rattle-train , the concentration camp , the gas chamber ; a provenance she could be familiar with only from books and films , documentation . Vera was a gentile atheist gratified by the idea that her lover was a Jew , orphaned by racism , without a name that was his own  --  this linked him with the open , daily purpose of her life , the files of displaced communities on her desk and , before her on the other side of it , day after day , the faces of those who had been made wanderers because they were decreed the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of expensive shops selling men 's clothing ; she bought French shirts and Italian ties , and because he was fond of a few Ghanaian gold weights he picked up on assignments in West Africa , searched the art and craft galleries to bring him additions to his collection . She was making up to him for the deprivation of childhood , deprivation like that of so many she knew in the veld settlements she investigated . She was giving him toys and sweets . Naked in bed with her , he was , also an infant deported , naked in the world . Vera continued to make love with her husband , even if she felt she had the delicacy not to initiate it . She thought of it as part of a strategy , both to have her lover and not to hurt him , lien ; for the credo she had adopted for the situation was the well-worn one that anything was permitted her , was her right , so long as no one was hurt . Otto had no woman she knew of ; there might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact was that the love-making with Ben was strangely successful . Ben must have been moved by her ; instead of hurt . It was rather like it had been long ago on the mountain holiday , and again after the birth of Annick ; she could not help being convulsed by wave after wave of orgasm . Bitch . p 68 Bitch , greeted her face in the mirror . And next day she went back to One-Twenty-One . There she felt it was her lover she was hurting . What lover would accept that a woman like her could enjoy making love with another man ? With her husband ? She was not free at all , after all . There was a clause in their love affair  --  she had formulated the small print of it , through her work she was familiar with the importance of clauses that allow breach of contract . This wo n't last long , you know . But the clause was forgotten , buried in bedclothes and that other fabric , of the intimacy of a certain complementary pattern in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with horror at what he recorded on film , the savagery of those who called their victims savages , the shooting of children , beatings , torture , and the savagery that this was beginning to bring forth in retaliation , the knifings and burnings in the revenge of the night . He was telling her of what he managed to film the previous day , before the police had threatened him with arrest unless he left the site of a school where they had thrown tear-gas into classrooms to drive out children who had stoned their vehicles . Dogs rounded up the terrified children , white policemen caught them at random and beat some as they were dragged to police vans , there were shots  --  the two children he saw fall screaming : he did not know whether they were dead or not , nor would anyone know , because at that point he and everyone there to record was ordered out of the area . Black kids , he said . As if expecting some explanation . ? Black kids . A girl tried to hide behind me. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Nazis did n't end in the war where your parents died , they were reborn here. ? p 69 He stirred as if to ask a question and did not . He stared at the food before them . A plate of delicatessen smoked ham and potato salad she had provided to indulge his native tastes . ? There 's something I have n't told you . I do n't like to tell even myself . But it 's true . You know what a Hitler Baby is ? ? His German accent became unusually pronounced . He knew she did . ? I 'm one . My mother was mated like a cow to produce a good German child for Hitler . I do n't know who the Aryan stud was . She did n't know . Was never told his name when he was put on her . Artificial insemination for a cow is better , hei 'm , it 's a syringe , hei 'm ?

But you want to know who she was ? ? she was an attendant in a ? what d' you call it  --  a public wash-place , a lavatory , she came from Bavaria . She had nothing , the only boast she could have she would tell me my father must have been a good Nazi , chosen to give me a better brain , a better body , a chance  --  I do n't know  --  than any ordinary man .

Vera said what came to her to be said . ? Shave off the beard . And so there in the kitchen of One-Twenty-One the past was interpreted and shed , he clasped her fist as he had done that first time in her office , they returned to the beginning newly , over again , something based on a recognition so alien that it transformed the feel of his body , for her , and hers for him . There was no appropriate place for that curious passion to be enacted , and so it happened in the kitchen , she took him in through the aperture of clothes pulled out of the way , standing up where they had risen from the kitchen table , they were clutched like a pillar shaking in an earth tremor , and never before or after in her life was she , in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such blazing sensation . That was the day and place of betrayal of Ben , Bennet , the chosen man . Bitch . Many years later , Otto Abarbanel has long left , and occasional meetings abroad , telephone calls from remote places , letters , have ended , and all sense of touch and feel associated with him seem to have returned to other responses as nerves regenerate after damage  --  that kitchen , One-Twenty-One Delville Wood , is still the day and place of betrayal , as a battlefield never loses its association . And that is why when Ben comes in with his offering of wine , Vera , spreading apart hands innocently soiled , a knife in one , suddenly drops her housewifely task , comes towards him , and embraces hint .  | Does the past return because one can rid oneself of it only slowly , or is the freedom actually the slow process of loss ?

In t hat moment before the traffic bore her on she could not possibly have recognized anyone but him , matching one whose unique features and bodily outline she carried within her . He was bent over his plate , his dark head down and shoulders curved . He was alone . By the sight of him she was overcome with desolation , premonition like the nausea of one about to faint . How could he look so solitary ? Did all the years together mean nothing ? A childish fear of abandon drained her . His lowered head and bowed shoulders knew without knowing that he was no longer her lover . His aloneness was hers ; not here , not now , but somewhere waiting .  | Under banners on posters in the offices of Movement Headquarters , just opened in the city , on photographs in progressive journals and newspapers , Didymus appeared among others released from prison or returned from exile . Our leaders , our heroes . Who would occupy which office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long a period when there had been leadership dispersed between a number of representatives in different countries of exile , leadership confined in prison , and leaders in the front organizations which had grown up and survived within the country . He did whatever was needed , as everyone must . Sometimes he found himself arranging protocol and press conferences ; then he was off to fulfil the request of some provincial branch for a speaker , he was in one of the first delegations to talk with white businessmen , he gave a graduation address at a college where the rector had hoped for some better-known face too busy to attend . But this was while it was taken as understood that his legal training rather than the avocation of clandestine missions he had carried out so successfully in the ( lays of exile and underground activity would decide what position he would hold on the national executive in  | a time , now , when that formation was legal and the political ethos was negotiation , the grinning face at receptions in place of the disguised one moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Sally with her affectionately exaggerated shrug as a softener to her rising voice answered Vera when her friend asked what position Didy held now .

And what a mob this is ... all these cultural workers who 're ashamed to call themselves painters and writers . And the insurance bosses and bank PROs showing how they appreciate our black souls . Now for Christ 's sake do n't quote me , Ben ! ?

Although Sibongile spoke of her job as if it were quite humble  --  it was the democratic vocabulary , hangover from exile with its brave denial of hierarchy  --  she was one who could not be reached except through a secretary these days . She had her offices and battery of command  --  computers , fax , assistants whose poor education and lack of skills she was attempting to tolerate while disciplining and training them . When there were complaints about her she said to her comrades in high positions what they themselves thought it better not to express . ? I do n't want to be told I behave like an exploiter just so someone can go on sitting around filing her nails or someone who was once detained thinks he 's for ever entitled to disappear two hours for lunch .

The furnishing of the house was completed , if too sparsely for her taste ; she liked beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little money saved while moving around in exile had had to be left behind . The daughter had been fitted out with all her mother needed to supply for the new school . There was a microwave oven installed in the kitchen so that she could leave a meal to be heated when she had an official obligation that meant she would be home only in time to find Didymus and her daughter in darkness lit up by a television film , or to take off her shoes and move about without disturbing the husband who , asleep , left space for her at his side . Home was set lip ; hut she did not have time to do the daily tasks that would p 75 it ; it was Didymus who took the shopping lists she scribbled in bed at night , who drove Mpho to and from her modern dance class , to the dentist , to the urgent obligations that schoolgirls have to be here or there , it was he who called the plumber and reported the telephone out of order . His working day was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files , briefcase , keys in the morning while he was dipping bread in coffee , changing back and forth from local news broadcasts to the BBC . Their working life was housed in the same building ; sometimes he came to look in on her office : she was talking fast on the telephone , held up a hand not to be interrupted , she was in the middle of briefing the fieldworkers through whom she had initiated research into the reintegration of returned exiles . She began to appear at many of the meetings he attended . ; Tided in , late , graceful with her well-dressed big hips , eyebrows arched when anyone was long-winded . She had a complaint about her director , who did n't want to attend and made a habit of asking her to do so in his stead . Let 's have a post-mortem , she would say , at home .

The abstentions from adultery that trust ' means to most couples are petty in comparison ; this was a grand compact beyond the capacity of those who live only for themselves . They argued , they lot in complicity over this issue or that , together in the line each would follow , she in her department , he at his higher level . They defended to each other a partiality for or lack of confi- p 76 dente in certain leaders . ? We need someone tough and quickthinking in that sort of negotiation . Sebedi 's too much like ?

And what you must remember is that he 's impressive , these early days , he sits with his hands folded and his big head held back that way , and the government boys see he 's really listening to them , he does n't scratch himself and drink water and stub out cigarettes like some of the other comrades , the young ones who 're only thinking what they 're going to say next . He commands respect . She drew back in staring reproach . ? Who wants respect from those people ?

They think if they hear themselves nicely addressed as minister this and doctor that , if they 're listened to attentively , the whole smoothing-over process is in progress , the blacks have been flattered into talking like white gentlemen , they 're nicely  | tamed . Why do you think we turn up in suits and ties instead of the Mao shirts and dashikis the leaders in countries up North wear ? So that the Boers on the other side of the table will think there 's a code between us and them , we 've discarded our Africanness , our blackness is hidden under the suit-and-tie outfit , it 's not going to jump out at them and demand !

They 're the ones you 're trying to find jobs for ! Mpho watched her parents as if at a tennis match , sometimes laughing at them , sometimes chipping in with an opinion of her own . Sibongile and Didymus encouraged her , proud of a bright girl whose intelligence had been stimulated in exile by a superior education which perhaps also disadvantaged her by setting her apart among black youngsters . They were uneasy about the school they had been relieved to find for her ; although mixed ' ost of the pupils were white , it retained the ethos and rituals a white segregated school . They were grateful that in the early reks when they were staying with their friends the Starks , Vera ad introduced the girl to some decent young black people with whom she enjoyed herself . Her surprising attachment to her grandmother unfortunately did not mean that there were any suitable contacts for her in the dirt and violence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight tautness , the tug of a string in the gut ready to tighten in defence of Sibongile  --  he was troubled that her frankness would be interpreted as aggression ; her manner , sceptical , questioning , iconoclastic , would be taken as disrespectful of the traditional style of political intercourse that had been established in the higher ranks of the Movement  | through many years of exile , and would count against her advancement at the level to which she had , for the first time , gained access . Even the way she used her body : coming into conference , where she was by proxy rather than right , on high heels that clipped across the floor , no attempt to move discreetly . He was anxious ; not looking at her , as if that would prevent others from being annoyingly distracted , then not being able to prevent himself from being aware of the stir of legs and seats as perfume marked the progress of her breasts and hips to her place . He felt that even her obvious undocile femininity would count against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefigured the disturbance in the male appropriation of power she might seem presumptuous enough to ignore . He was sensitive to any response to her comments , sometimes hearing , as offensive proof of what he feared for her , undertones that merely made her laugh ( the volume of her laugh was not moderated to the atmosphere of conference , either ) or provided her with the opportunity of expounding a new point . He was familiar with the way things were done , always had been done , must be done , he was part of them ; he could sense how others would feel towards a personality like Sibongile 's ; and a woman 's . What he knew was remarkable in her could be misunderstood . He did not know how to give her the benefit of his own experience , teach her how to conduct herself if she wanted to realize the ambitions he saw were awakened in her . Home for her was the politics of home . That 's how things had worked out . But she was n't going about it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person with such high confidence in and expectations of herself . God help me , and Mpho , and everyone else she knows , when that happens . Didymus was against nepotism , but what is nepotism ' ? ? nothing more than putting in a word when this seems appro-  | priate . He was one of the old guard , there were private moments when he could remark to a comrade with whom he had experienced much in so many situations and crises , that he scarcely saw Sibongile these days , she was working so hard , she was so dedicated to her returnees . And the permissible observation was always received with some such formula : Oh yes , she 's doing a remarkable job of it . But whether this was a cautious assurance that her value was not unrecognized , and went no further , or whether it was to remind the old comrade that he should not think he could promote his wife , the response was dismissive . A brush-off.  | Driving through an area where her work took her Mrs Stark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seeing about her kept being diverted , as if by a seized muscle which will not be discernible to any companion . There was , among the documents in that loaded sling bag that was always with her , a letter found in her office mail that morning . Ivan 's handwriting on the envelope , not addressed as usual by one of his typists and sent to his childhood home . She had opened it in the awkward privacy granted to the recipient of a letter in the company of others . Hardly taken in any details , any explanation ; just the central fact her skimming arrested : Ivan was getting divorced . She folded the letter without reading the last page and thrust it somewhere in the bag . The undertone of a shy young woman was speaking of brutality . ? So you see , Mrs Stark , I mean they 's upgraded Phambili Park , sewerage and that , and we all building , but now the men from the hostels is just coming to run all over , the women from the squatters ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses  --  what can a person say to them ?

' The sight of his handwriting on the envelope is already a signal of something unusual to be conveyed ; a banker so successful that he is going back and forth from London to Poland , Hungary and Russia to negotiate new banking alliances does n't have time to lick stamps personally . As if she were saying it to Ben now , she heard herself , when Ivan came back to South Africa and married his schooldays girl : He ' 11 stay with her as long as he 's not suc-cessful. ? so I was scared , I can tell you , I was so scared , and my mom , we just hid there without the lights while there was running and screaming , terrible , and then that noise , that noise ! something falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I thought what if it 's Colin , he was n't home yet Billboards on bare ground proclaimed the right to shelter elevated to middle-class status .

That 's not the kind of attitude you 'd expect to have towards young married people . Hurt . Ben , who had been Bennet , the young man who took someone else 's wife while the man was away at war , had fear disguised as disapproval in his face , the withdrawal in his eyes in their dark caves . He did not want his son to suffer any complications in the search for sexual fulfilment and companionship that beckons from that other billboard : Happiness .

Combis have widened and channelled the dirt road to the passage of a river in flood , the Legal Foundation station-wagon is carried along , keeping track as the combis draw level so close the elbow of the driver out of his window almost touches the arm of the station-wagon 's outside mirror ; held back when the combis stop at speed , without warning , to take on or discharge a passenger . p 83 ? Oh Mrs Stark , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ca n't .

For the moment ; the Foundation must not flounder in effects , it tackles causes . ? like at the butcher 's shop , I never knew our brains was like that There is no stain on the doorstep . Neither blood nor the red-veined jelled grey displayed in shallow pans . All has been scrubbed away in the desperate upkeep of housewifely standards . A tall woman is waiting , bony in the way that often comes to African fleshiness from the mixture with European blood , and prematurely aged ( she could probably give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defeat poverty by the virtues of fastidious cleanliness and decency believed to belong without effort to people with money , the rewards of being white . The door is not that of a house but the side-door of a garage ; a stove , refrigerator , TV , beds , the family is living there . ? Colin 's doing the house on weekends , oh it 's over a year now , a slow busi-ness ! ? The older woman insists on making tea , there 's a granadilla cake with yellow icing , she breaks in for emphasis : ? His brother-in-law , my other daughter 's husband , he 's in the trade , and there 's others in the family comes to plaster and so on. - - Sundays it 's quite a party ! ? Distracted from her tears by the comfort of pride , the young one shows Mrs Stark over what will he her house one day , Sunday by Sunday , the breakfast nook , Colin 's clever with his hands he 's doing the table himself ,  | the master bedroom ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entrance to the yard for them , the living-dining 's going to have a hatch counter to the kitchen , ma 's room with a separate bathroom and that , this 's the foundation for a patio and braai . The visitor is led outside again to admire the facade . There is no roof yet but on the unplastered wall where the window frames are paneless the replica of a brass carriage lamp is in place just as if it were standing to light the pillared entrance to a white man 's driveway . The assertion of this half-built house is so undeniable that both women feel an unreality in returning to the object of Mrs Stark 's presence , which was supposed to be an inquiry into what happened in Phambili Park the night a man was murdered on the young woman 's doorstep . This sort of investigation was not normally within the purview of the Foundation , but on this occasion , as increasingly lately , the connection between the people who had been removed from a site and squatted near Phambili Park because they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwellers they were subject to , pursuing them , the disruption this in turn caused residents in a legally proclaimed , upgraded etc. township , was relevant to the Foundation 's case against the removal . The young woman leads Mrs Stark up and down roads in the veld drawn by the rough fingernail of an earth-mover . Woodpecker tapping  --  building going on wherever you look  --  the veld an endless offering to the infinity of light that is a clear Transvaal sky , scaffolding standing out in the exaggerated perspective of bareness , de Chirico , Dali , thought they imagined it , Munch saw open-mouthed women fleeing in space from dingy , smoke-smouldering encrustation of shanties , there , over there . But where is Europe , what place has the divorce of a banker in the mind of anyone picking a way over rubble and weeds to the neat hallucination of small houses with their fancy burglar grilles , and flowered bedsheets hung out to dry , someone  | speaking to families living in garages while the habitation that has existed over years , in their minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which money is saved and free Sundays are available . The normality in these homes  --  camping out in the garage is home , because it is the first occupation of what has existed in mind  --  is also hallucinatory . So what is normality ? Is n't it just the way people manage to live under any particular circumstance ; the children who are teetering a stolen supermarket trolley under the weight of two drums of water back to the squatter camp ( one of the Phambili Park residents ' complaints is that the squatters come over to use their taps ) ? the children are performing a normal task in terms of where and how they live . They yell and pummel one another , tumbling about as they go . A carriage lamp is the blazon of aspiration , fixed to the wall where a mob smashes a man 's head in . Mrs Stark put her notes into the sling bag , assuring that she would find her way back to the city . Without the face of a resident in black areas as escort beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors and closing the windows . Moving in a capsule ; neither what usefulness her notes will be to the case nor the letter lying beneath the notebook dispelled the unreality of the place just left behind . She was accustomed to squatter camps , slum townships , levels of existence of which white people were not aware ; the sudden illusion of suburbia , dropped here and there , standing up stranded on the veld between the vast undergrowth of tin and sacking and plastic and cardboard that was the natural terrain , was something still to be placed . She had an urge to pull over to the roadside and read the letter . But it was a resort to distraction ; just as having to go about her business to somewhere named Phambili Park had served as  | a reason to thrust the letter half-read into her catch-all bag . And you do n't stop for any reason or anyone on roads these days . With one hand on the wheel , she delved into the bag to feel for the envelope . Ivan a frowning child her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him his habit of fingering his nose while he talked ( do n't do it , it 's ugly ) at the butcher 's I never knew our brains was like that a carriage lamp to shine out over the grey spill She found she was at the turn-off to the hospital where the soft-voiced witness had said people from the squatter camp had taken refuge . So she drove into the hospital grounds , waved on by security guards , and brought the car to a standstill . But not to read a letter . She trudged over raked gravel between beds of regimented marigolds towards the wings of the hospital , dodging the hiss of the sprinkler system . Pigeons waddled to drink from the spray ; a two-metre-high security fence under the hooded eyes of stadium lights surrounded this provincial administration 's hallucination of undisturbed ordinance . All along the standard red-brick and green-painted walls of the hospital people were collected as if blown there as plastic bags and paper were blown against the fence . Women sat on the ground with their legs folded under skirts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men hunched with heads down on their knees , in a dangling hand a cigarette stub , or stood against the walls ; looked up from staring at feet in broken track shoes advertised for the pleasures of sport . She greeted some groups ; they blinked listlessly past her . She made a pretext for her approach , Were there people living in the hospital ? An old woman took a pinch of snuff and pointed while she drew it up her nostrils . Are you sleeping there ? A woman tugged at the blanket tied cutting into the shape p 87 of her sturdy breasts , needing to accuse anyone who would listen . ? They tell us no more place . Here ! We sleeping here ! Out of the stasis others were attracted . They did n't seem to understand questions in English or Afrikaans  --  Mrs Stark knew from experience how people in shock and bewilderment lose their responses in confusion , anyway  --  but the woman in the blanket spoke for them . ? Five days I been here . What can I do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at this old man , no blanket , nothing , the hospital give him blanket , when he 's run those men catch his brother , TV , bicycle , everything is gone from his place  --  shit ! The man was coughing , his knees pressed together and shoulders narrowed over his chest , folding himself out of the danger of existence ; the babies sucked at breasts , greedily taking it on . ? And this woman , she try to go to her home yesterday , in the night she come back again . No good , terrible The woman had the serene broad face that at the end of t he twentieth century is seen only on young peasants and nuns , she will have followed her man from some Bantustan to the city that had no place for her , but neither the squatter camp nor the flight from it had had time to redraw the anachronism of her face in conformation with her place and time . She did n't yet have the tough grimace pleated round the eyes and the stiff distended nostrils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was displaying her . She prepared herself obediently to speak . A hump under cloth on her back was a baby . A small girl hid against her thick calves . ? Friday there by Phambili where we living they come to get my husband . We run away but there 's plenty people running , night-time , and I do n't see where is my raised hands towards her back , carrying the weight ) ? now I do n't see my two children when I 'm come to this hospital . Now yesterday I think I must go back to my house and see where is my children , my boys children , but when I come in the veld I see those men again they by my place She looked to others , someone , to find words for this sight , an explanation , what to do . Were they hostel men , did they carry knobkerries , knives , how were they dressed ? The woman pulled the baby 's legs more securely round her waist and took again the long breath of her panic as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could she be sure what she saw , how could she know anything but the urgency of her flesh and the flesh of her children to get away . What about you  --  you get a chance to see who they were , the men who came that night ? The woman with the blanket stood before Mrs Stark on bare planted feet . ? Me ? You say what you see , your house is burn down or they kill you . Better I see nothing. ? A fly was creeping round her cheek under the eye . Too much had happened for her to notice so small a predator treating her as if she were already a corpse . And the letter . Lying at the bottom of the sling bag under the notes , under the sign of spilt brains and carriage lamp and the people staring for salvation , becoming dark clusters and clumps along a wall as she walked away from them . When she got home  --  it was too late to go back to the Foundation  --  she came upon the letter . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounty of divorce , in an order of life that could take for granted rights and their material assur-ances  --  her normality . It 's always been her house ; lien moved  | in with her , first as lover , then husband . It contains tables , lamps , posters and framed photographs , worn path on a carpet , bed  --  silent witness to that normality . She leant against the windowsill , where there was still sunset light . The handwritten address directed to the Foundation was itself part of the text waiting to be read . Why does he tell me and not his father ? Why did he know  --  think  --  she would understand better ? The envelope written in the well-rounded upright script she had seen form from his kindergarten alphabet , sent to a clandestine address like a love letter ; a claim to share a secret that should not have turned up again at the bottom of a bag of notes . He can not possibly know what she does not know herself : whether he is the son of love-making on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in her hand ) one last time with the returned soldier , or whether he is the son of his mother 's lover , Bennet . He does know . Somehow he does know . She has an irrational certainty . It was always there , ca n't be denied ; he does n't only look like her , in the genes that formed him is the knowledge of his conception . If she has never known who fathered him , he does . The first cells of his existence encoded the information : he is the child of the childless first marriage , conceived after it was over on this bedroom floor in an hour that should be forgotten . The information was always there : when she and Ben took him into their bed for a cuddle , as a tiny child , and in the innerfocussed emergence from sleep his gaze would be fixed on her eyes ; when , a grown man , a banker , he danced with her , each holding the other in their secrecy . You might have been aware , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London that things were not going too well . Alice made me promise we 'd keep up the appearance and 1 gave in  --  mistakenly , I believe , but when you 're what 's known  | as the guilty party ( that 's my designation with the lawyers ... ) you try to make small concessions in order not to seem too much of a bastard . I should have known better , not so ? Alice was plotting , poor thing , I suppose , every kind of delaying tactic she could think of . I sometimes wish you could be here now to tell her what people like you and I accept , that if you did n't exactly tell Annie and me , we somehow learned from you about emotions  --  you ca n't fake love . If it 's gone it 's gone . She wants me to stay with her , she says she does n't ask me to love her . She 's grown to be the kind of woman who 's content to be used like a prostitute , I should go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what she thinks of as the sexual needs of men that have nothing to do with love . She does n't understand for a moment that the idea fills me with disgust . I do n't want a vessel for my sex . Vera , I 've outgrown her , she 's the little girl I took to school dances . For a long time I 've had nothing I could discuss with her , not my work , not what 's in the newspapers , not my ideas about life . If it 's not concerning Adam , his earache , his school marks , whether he needs a new tennis racket , there 's nothing . I ca n't live like that and I 'm not going to be party to her weak choice to do so . I have another woman . Have had , of course , for a long time . She has n't pressed me into divorcing Alice , I can tell you that . She 's not the type to go in for emotional blackmail . She 's a Hungarian redhead , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , half-Jewish , and she 's very bright , an investment banker . There 's no messy tangle on her side , her husband died at thirtynine five years ago , a brain tumour . No children . I do n't know whether to contest Alice over Adam . He 's almost grown up . She 's got a strong case for custody , but does n't an adolescent boy need a father , more ? Difficult for me to judge , because I had both . All the old cliches of what 's best for him etc . Sometimes I  | just want to get out , I 'd agree to anything . Other times , I feel bad about the boy . This is beginning to sound like one of the soap operas Alice watches on tele and quickly switches off when I come in , to pretend she does n't . No doubt every divorce is a soap opera . And you get addicted to your own soap opera , never mind the important things that are happening in the world .

But it 's so much more profitable to sell arms , and they need money , no financial aid consortium can give them what can be earned by selling to the Middle East . I 'm enclosing a photograph .

He must have thought better of it ; had the instinct that a photograph , a face ringed , is no way to announce a betrayal . When she heard Ben come in , his relaxed home-coming sigh as he paused in the passage at the bookshelf where the day 's : nail was always left , her concourse alone with Ivan 's letter sank away ; the reason why Ivan did n't write to Ben was because Ben is his father , of course , must be ; he knows how deeply Ben loves him , and does n't want to upset him with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life . Vera threw away the envelope .  | Who are the faces arranged in a collage round the great man himself ? The posters are curling at the corners and some have faded strips where sunlight from a window has barred them day after day , month after month . Crowds who dance their manifesto in the streets are too young to recognize anyone who dates from the era before exile unless he is one of the two or three about whom songs were sung and whose images were kept alive on T-shirts . Didymus went about mostly unrecognized ; disguised , now , as himself . In the ranks of the entourage at mass rallies the cheers and chants fell pleasingly on him among other veterans as a category to whom this sort of valediction was due ; it did n't matter who they were individually . The press mixed up the attribution of names and that did n't matter either . In a democratic movement the personality cult must be kept to a minimum , except in the case of dead heroes , who are an example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or faction that might be divisive . The time of welcoming posters was over ; there were many new faces , or the unexpected appearance of known ones in positions they had not held previously . But these positions p 93 were interim ones  --  more or less on the level of his own adaptation to a variety of impermanent roles . When the date was announced of the congress at which the Movement 's elections for office would take place , lobbying began , of course . Among the strong group to which he belonged , those returned from prison and from experience as a government in exile , the concern  --  not to be admitted outside their own ranks  --  was how to concede positions to those who had earned them by keeping the Movement alive within the country , while retaining key positions for those who had surely earned them by conducting the Movement from exile or prison . Women 's groups , youth groups , trade union groups were busy gathering support for this or that candidate ; the old guard welcomed the influx as affirming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clandestinity . They had no need to fear they would not be returned to office  --  loyalty to the most militant is a dominant emotion in the masses ; deserved ; to be counted on . Meanwhile I ) idymus made it quietly but firmly known that on the new National Executive he would not expect to continue doing whatever came up . He would get the legal department , or at least something on that level ; it was tacitly assured by his comrades on the outgoing Executive that this went without saying . Among the possible newcomers Sibongile was nominated by a combination of returnees and a women 's organization , neither very prominent as yet . He did n't think she had much chance but was proud of the recognition nomination , at least , brought her . ? They 've put me up only because I 'm a woman  --  I 'm wise to that and I do n't think it 's a good enough reason . The women just want to see one of us there among you men. - - Of course the women have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of , they know what you can do. ? p 94 ? For them ? Well , then they know more than I do. ? Her theatrical , comic stare . ? All I know is how we allowed the government to get away with giving us amnesties and passports and nothing else . All I know is we did n't hold out for training centres , housing  --  your executive did n't insist , it was up to you . In my office , with three raw youngsters and a pittance , I 'm trying to deal with the results  --  and believe me , I 'm not making mir-acles. - Didymus had always appreciated her vehemence . He acknowledged the reproach , smiling . ? I promise you I 'll take it up in the new executive . What has been forbidden for so long  --  a gathering , any gath-ering  --  becomes a kind of fairground of released emotion , with its buskers , its symbolic taking , together , of food and drink , its garrulous decibels rising after long silence , its own insigniabanded marshals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived , where men and women discipline themselves . No more police , no more dogs , no more tear-gas , no more beatings on the way to the Black Maria . Even if it never comes , it is enacted here and now . And as always in the mix of human affairs the tension in the sense that the future of the country is being decided is combined with dissatisfaction with the catering and discomfort occasioned by a hopeless provision of too few toilets . Didymus moved among old acquaintances , old comrades who had to introduce themselves with reminiscence of campaigns they had shared with him . He had the politician 's flattering tactic of the hand on the shoulder , the grin of recognition even without knowing whom he was greeting . Every now and then he would excuse himself from his progression , called to confer with an- p 95 other of the outgoing Executive members  --  questions of protocol coming up , complaints from the press , requests from the groups that should have been settled in advance ; in a country where it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall to meet for any kind of political purpose , what are routine procedures anywhere else here were arcane secrets of power and privilege . While his conclave drew aside , their eyes glancing into and away from the throng as they sheltered within their halfturned backs , in the air thick with voices and the friction of movement , the sussuration of clothing , the echo of coughs , laughter , a slithering stamping of feet , the tremolo of ululating cries broke again and again into song . People sing on marches , they sing at funerals , they sing on the way to jail ; it was their secret , all that time of the forbidden . You ca n't toyi-toyi your way to freedom , Sibongile often tartly remarked in exile . He saw her , caught up in a sway and shuffle of women and young men . Her shoulders shrugged rhythmically and her head was thrown back ; Sibongile was enjoying herself , or learning how to be a politician . He was amused . The old guard sat on the podium through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people they had gone to prison for , gone into exile for  --  and died for : in their faces were those who were absent , who would never come back . Didymus , looking out at his people , had a strange realization , in his body , in his hands resting on his thighs , of his survival . I le had moved among them as if dead ; had he died under treatment in Moscow , the fiction , and walked among them those months as a phantom ? Disguised , unrecognized , do you exist ? And now they see him ; back to life . It was a conviction of pure existence . He sat there ; he was . In this state he heard the results of the election announced . His name . was not among those voted to the new Executive . The  | applause continued , the shouts flung about like streamers , the songs lifted , the list of names was somewhere beneath . Sibongile Maqoma . She was hidden in a scrum of triumphant supporters . He was congratulating his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dip of the cheek to each cheek , ridiculous , as if he were a prize-fighter coming forward in defeat to embrace the victor . Nobody said anything , with the single exception of a comrade who had always felt enmity towards him : ? It 's crazy . That they dump you , man . He made his way to the chanting , dancing press around Sibongile , pushing to get to her until someone saw who he was and nudged to have him let through . His embrace was again a public one , the hug and hard kiss on the mouth from the comrade-husband ; his presence before her bounced off the excited glare of her face like the flash of a piece of glass in the sun . But what could she say right then  --  he was eddied about with some sort of respect among those celebrating her , the husband congratulated by eager hands . When the surface of the crowd began to be broken up like foam in a current she appeared drifting to him with Vera Stark linked by the arm . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave his seat vacant for a successor . Vera was one of the team of independent observers  --  lawyers were regarded as having the most credibility for the task  --  brought in to monitor the votes . Clasped chummily by Sibongile as if they were schoolgirls after a victorious match , Vera stood waiting for him to speak ; knowing he would n't . ? You 'll be co-opted . So it does n't mean anything . He patted her on the arm , smiling at the lie between them . ? Let 's go and look for a drink  --  we must toast Sally , man ! -  - -  Oh there 's a party ! We 're all going to a party ! Vet-all come in our car  --  who 's got the keys , did I keep them or have  | you ? Sibongile used this abstracted jollying tone when Mpho was little and had to be hustled off for an inoculation or an exam . After Vera had entered the back of the car Sibongile stood with her hand on her door , turned her head , close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - - Of course I 'm all right ! What do you think ! Now come on . At the party he took part in the noisy discussions that assessed the composition of the new Executive which ( on balance ' was the phrase ) had kept the key positions intact while pushing a few of the leadership upstairs under honorary titles , and bringing in new people with better contacts within the country . One would have thought him quite detached from the event ; he succeeded in this : no one dared commiserate with him . Towards the end of the evening , when he and everyone else who took alcohol heightened the atmosphere of achievement ( the younger comrades tended to find this a weakness of the old guard and drank fruit juice ) , he himself was in a mood to believe he felt that all that mattered was that the congress had established conventional political legitimacy for the long-outlawed Movement . You had your role , your missions , you took the risks of your life , you disappeared and reappeared , went into prison or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those years to anyone , the benefit did not belong to you and your achievement was that you wanted it that way . The marital tradition of the post-mortem between husband and wife who were also comrades : one o'clock in the morning in the bedroom , the silence of weariness , stripping off shoes that have become constraints , opening waistbands that leave the weal of a long day  --  Sibongile burst into anger . ? Those sly bastards ! They planned it ! They wanted you out , I know that cabal , I 've seen their slimy smiles . They 've p 98 never forgiven you the time when you opposed them over the business of landings on the coast --  Oh nonsense . It was a crazy idea , I was n't the only one. - - How can you say that ? You were the one . You were the one who had gone inside and reconnoitred , you were the one who knew whether it was possible to carry it out or not . What you said had to be what High Command would listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made fools of . He sat down on the bed . This seemed to make her angrier . He did not look into her anger . ? All so long ago. - - They slapped you on the back , they whispered with you in corners , I saw them , even tonight , right there ! And all the time they had it all set up to get you out . It is n't long ago , for them . They do n't forget they did n't come out of that business too well . She was pulling clothes over her head and flinging them across the room . Her straightened hair broke loose from its combs and stood up blowsily , her mouth was squared open , anger made her ugly . ? For God 's sake , Sibo ? He changed from English to their language , or rather hers , which was the tongue of their intimacy . ? It 's done . It 's happened . I do n't want to deal with it now . It 's political life , we held everything together in exile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time to start stirring up trouble . There may be a purpose , I do n't know , something else planned for me. - - Hai you ! What purpose ! You going to grow a beard and all that stuff and infiltrate  --  where ? What for ? Where ca n't we just get off a plane at an airport and walk in , now ? We 're not , living in the past ! ?  | ? That 's exactly what you 're saying  --  we are  --  there was a plot against me because of something that happened outside , done with . For God 's sake , let 's sleep . She lay beside him stiffly , breathing fast . ? I do n't sleep . I ca n't turn over and forget about it. - - Listen , woman. ? He sat up with effort . ? You are going to be there , now . In there . Here at home in the country . Keep your mind on what you have to do , you have to work with everyone on the Executive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to English . ? On principle . Ever heard of it , Didymus . On principle. - - You 've got a lot to learn . Let me look after my own affairs. - - Your affairs are my affairs . Have I lived like any other woman , hubby coming home regularly from work every day ? Have I known , months on end , whether you were dead or alive ? Tell me . And could I ask anybody ? Did I ever expect an answer ? Could I tell our child why her father left her ? Our affairs. - - Not now . Not in politics , where you are now . Deep breaths snagged on a few sobs . She had always wept when she was angry . But was she also giving vent to the emotions of excitement and pride she had repressed out of consideration for him , when in the hall filled with delegates she heard that she was one of their chosen ?  | We do n't seem to have much success with them . All he said . ? What d' you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have chosen for him , but he 's good at it , and Annie always wanted to be a doctor , she 's doing good work is n't she , her heart 's in it ? But she knew what he meant . Annick , inheritor of his beautiful face , had brought many boys home when she was a teenager but since she had qualified and taken a post in community medicine in the Cape she appeared to have no man and in her thirties gave no sign of marrying ; Ivan was getting divorced without showing enthusiasm for a new woman who evidently was as much business associate as lover : Arid lives , by Ben 's hidden standards of high emotion . ? Well I do n't suppose we were such a good example  --  at least to Ivan. - - I 've never been divorced . The forgotten heat of blush , called up by Ben in her cheeks : Bennet , who thought he had seduced someone 's wife but had been seduced by her , and never since made love to another woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the  | image bent alone over a meal in a restaurant that came back to her with blood in her face . I love you . That was in the blood , too , but she could not say it , what reason would he find for such a  --  declaration , at this moment ? What reason was there ? ? Anyway , it 's not whether or not we make a success of their lives . Nothing to do with us . His palms smoothed along his jaw-line , a familiar gesture in the language of their marriage , not , as it might seem , a physical response to the shadow of his dark beard that by evening always had appeared again , but a sign of disagreement . ? Maybe we should take the boy if they 're squabbling over him . Give him a stable home for a year or two . He went away to write a letter to Ivan , turning from what he knew was her alarmed silence . Ben did n't show her the letter and she did not ask to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ivan . It was not mentioned when Ivan telephoned , as he did now and then , or they called him because there had not been time or thought to write to him . The idea that there could be space in their life for something more was mislaid like a document lost in the bottom of the files where the struggle for another kind of space grew up every day around her . On the western border people from a tribe that had been moved with the concession that they could come back to their land to tend the graves of their ancestors for one day a year did not leave at nightfall but began to build huts . The sullen silence of reclaim met the arrival of authorities to evict them ; they were left there  --  temporarily , the Foundation was warned , when it took up the issue on the appeal of the tribe . Vera and Lazar Feldman , a young colleague , found themselves proceeding from instructions of two kinds : one , from their own training in secular law , that the owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance ; the other , from the people p 102 who were thatching huts and surrounding them with fences of thorned branches and hacked-off prickly pear plants , that the instruction to return and take possession came from the an-cestors . It was easy to see this use of ancestor worship as a political tactic shrewd peasants had thought of beyond the rational ingenuity of lawyers ; but there were moments when , listening to the people 's spokesmen , she felt confusion and uncertainty ? not about them , but in herself ; whether the only validity of their claim lay outside the political struggle , outside the challenging of laws made by governments that rise and fall , in the continuation of life itself from below and above the very ground that sustained it . What other claim is there that holds ? The wars fought over land , the boundary proclamations , the paper deeds of sale  --  each cancels the other . What was she  --  the Founda-tion  --  working for , if not for that claim ? But it did n't look good enough in legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal right  --  it was too good , for that . With a shift in a chair or a half-smile she and Lazar passed over the instruction from the ancestors and took that which came from their own strategical experience in opposing the law through its interstices , which consisted mainly in delaying tactics . The action of re-evicting the people would be held off  --  maybe so long that the present policies of land ownership would be torn up . Who knows ? Such things are not discussed with Lazar ; he is young , and would not understand that doubts do not mean that belief in the necessity of the work she does is abandoned . And even while this case was occupying her , Oupa came with a favoured opening : they 've got a problem , we 've got a problem , he 's got a problem . The owner of that apartment building where he was living was seeking the eviction of some tenants . p 103 ? The problem is , rooms on the roof . There are many people living up there. - - But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's it . The tenants of the flats let them out to , say , one person or two . Then those people take in more . People who work in the day let the bed to people who work at night and sleep in the day . It 's like that . Yes , it was like that ; when the apartments were built for white people , for their occupancy , their way of life , for the white millennium , when they lived in the apartments , each had the right to one of the rooms to accommodate a servant . ? I did n't know about it . So I have n't got anyone up there . They laughed together at the missed opportunity . But the problem ' remained , between them on Mrs Stark 's desk . Oupa had received an eviction order along with the other black tenants . The Foundation would have to look into it , take it up on behalf of them all . Oupa had been so proud , so happy to move in . Yet he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brown suede , and he asked his old adviser and friend something he 'd never done before  --  she did n't know he went to the theatre  --  whether a current play was to be recommended ? He had about him the confidence of a young man elated to find himself attractive to a chosen girl ; well , circumstance kept his wife away in another part of the country , absence makes room for other attachments , and perhaps they were parted , emotionally , by reasons only absence makes clear . She filed at court an intention to defend against the eviction order ; she had to find time to interview the other tenants . Along the corridors of Delville Wood the old , faint signals from One-T'wenty-One were jammed by the static of complaint , voluble p 104 indignation that buzzed about her in flats she had never before entered , and by the sight of the cubicles on the windswept roof , water dribbling from the communal washrooms , spirit stoves beside makeshift beds that in her clandestine occupancy of the white millennium had existed above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben was negotiating finance for the new enterprise in which he had involved himself . Promotional Luggage . She made staggering , clownish movements of hands and head when , that evening , she heard the name , the term . What did it mean ? The gestures offended . He read scorn or ridicule into them , and she felt exasperation at having to deny these . He had to be coaxed to explain coldly . Suitcases and briefcases designed exclusively for executives , to their requirements and incorporating their logos in materials superior to some embossed stamp . Custom-made . Business has its jargon just as the test-cases of the Foundation have . After a bath to wash away the ancestral instruction from beneath the earth and the sense of lying , herself , buried in One-Twenty-One with reality windswept and forlorn ignored above her head ( for if you deny any time , any part of your life , you have no continuity of existence ) , she dressed and perfumed herself to go with Ben to a business dinner . They agreed it was inexplicable that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leisure ; apparently they are lonely after the occupation of the day and want to fill this vacuum with a continuation of the same company and the same talk over an extended taking of food and drink . He looked at her in detail , a sculptor 's eye for line and volume , her legs patterned in a filigree of lacey black stockings , her waist marked with a wide belt , her face made up sufficiently to conform with what would be expected of her . For her it was a calculation ; for him it put something of the fascinating distance  | between them that had existed when he first saw her , unapproachable , somebody else 's wife . ? You look lovely. - - My old glad rags . In the car he took up what her banal show of modesty provided the opportunity to say . ? Unless I do something about making some money now we 're going to be without resources when we 're really old . ( My god , I 'm beginning to use their vocabulary . ) Hard up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Promotional Luggage is about . They had never talked about provision for some long survival . A country where there was so much death  --  why should you need to choose your own solution . ? If you can believe we 're going to live so long. - - It 's easy to think there 's the option of dying before you run out of cash. - - We 'll always have somewhere , Ben . We 've always got the house . She had taken him in there , into the booty from her relationship with another man ; he had given up the idea of becoming a sculptor to provide for her through Promotional Luggage . She put out a hand and squeezed his thigh , a compact , one of the bargains constantly negotiated by marriage . The restaurant is called the Drommedaris , after the ship that carried the first European to the country ; it 's fashionable for cartels that own hotels and restaurants to feel they honour history and claim patriotism with such names . History and patriotism implying settler history and patriotism . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be expensively dressed and willing to pay one hundred per cent p 106 profit on a bottle of wine . The password comes from the client 's own cabalistic vocabulary  --  promotion  --  and is evidenced without being pronounced : up-market . Everyone 's main course is served at the same moment by waiters who , taking the cue from the senior among them like members of an orchestra with one eye on the conductor , simultaneously flourish silver-plated covers from the plates . Revealed are not four-and-twenty blackbirds ( she catches Ben 's eye across the table ) but attempts at culinary distinction and originality that combine incompatible ingredients in  --  fortunately  --  an unidentifiable mixture . Eat . It 's expensive , therefore it 's a privilege , she admonishes herself . It you do n't like it , you 're a prig . Between courses a fake silver egg-cup of watery ice cream is served that coats the palate it is supposed to clear for more eating ; a ritual someone in the cartel has picked up in eagerness to claim elegance as well as history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conversation , for the men frequently speak of this or that absent colleague being taken on board ' some enterprise . And there are others referred to as small fry ; the fingerlings in the sea of business .

He assiduously signals a waiter to fill her wineglass and passes with surface attention friendly remarks suitable to feminine interests ( Just like my wife , she 's always removing those chunks of ice they put in the water . Where do you have your holiday house  --  Plettenberg ? ? do try some of this , looks exciting does n't it oh I agree the Cape is too windy but I 'm out in my ski-boat , that 's my passion , Yvonne 's a girl for winter holidays , game parks , you know , all that ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table purdah in which women chat to one another under the vociferous competitive exchanges of the men . An Afrikaner , dressed , coiffured and made up in the television-star style of an indeterminate age that will never go beyond forty while at the same time adopting every change of fashion , flashing her mascara-spiked eyes from this speaker to that , clinking gold and ivory bracelets and neoncoloured jumbo watch as she laughs in the right places , calls out a tag punch-line now and then that reinforces attention to the male speaker rather than draws it to herself . Some group 's public relations director , a prototype of how , in the choice of a female for the job , the display of possible sexual availability may be exploited to combine with suitably acquired male aggression . Poor thing ; she comes clip-clopping into the ladies ' room on highheeled hooves and behind the door there is the noisy stream of her urine falling , she 's even taught herself to piss boldly as a man . Or perhaps that 's wronging her  --  she comes out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry . At the table the host stands courteously to see his righthand partner seated again , they know how to treat a lady . There are cigars and small fruits encased in glassy hardened sugar , as Circa-Cola and buns are distributed at treats in the townships whose workers are being discussed . A recent strike in the cardboard container trade is being compared with that in the tanning industry . Opposite Vera a man keeps pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose and breathing heavily in readiness for an opening to speak . At last : ? We told them  --  called them all together with their shop steward , I do n't talk to those fellows on their own , eh , you only get told afterwards he did n't have a mandate  --  we said , look , you can bring your wives ( hands chopped edge-on to the table , then lifted ) you can bring your children ( hands again ) you can bring the whole bang shoot , we 'll p 108 give you blankets , we 'll supply food , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

But there was one guy who said no , he has to stay away . Not for political reasons , no , no . So he said . But because he ca n't leave his house for two days , in the township .

Some mornings , attacks on farms ; a white farmer shot , the wife raped or killed , money and car missing . Taken . Taken ' to mean the motive is robbery ; as if robbery has a single meaning in every country at every period . Take cars , take money , take life . These mornings robbery means taking everything you have n't got from those who appear to have everything : money , a car to sell for money , a way of life with house and land and cattle . Otherwise , why kill as well as rob ? Why rape some farmer 's ugly old wife ? No violence is more pI 111 frightening than the violence of revenge , because it is something that what the victim stands for brings upon him . It is seldom retribution for a personal deed , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with desire ; the penis is a gun like the gun held to a head , its discharge is a discharge of bullets . She lies in a body-warmed bed , the first refuge after birth and the last , for those fortunate enough to die a natural death . What happened one morning was the sudden startle of the word Odensville ' in the newsreader 's bland recital . Nine people were killed and fourteen injured in violence at the Odensville squatter camp last night . The clash occurred when a local farmer , leading a group of armed supporters , tried to evict the squatters . Police report that it is unclear whether the bullet wounds sustained were the result of the group 's action or of cross-fire from the squatters . An AK ? 47 and three Makarov pistols were recovered at the scene . The farmer , Mr Tertius Odendaal , said that he had called by radio the local farmers ' defence commando when the squatters were spotted approaching his house under cover of darkness , carrying stones and weapons . ' The Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Odendaal . The day he shut his door in the face of its lawyer , her driver , and the squatters ' spokesman , Zeph Rapulana , was the end of negotiation with him . Communication was with his lawyer . Rapulana came to the city a number of times to confer with Vera on the squatters ' options in a course of action . It had become clear to her that it was best for the Foundation to be guided by this man , rather than the other way about . Ile read , enquired , informed himself of all the intricacies of legislation , so that her task was simply to formulate procedure ; there was a zest in working together with a plaintiff rather than p 1 12 taking over decisions for the helpless , which was her function most of the time . He sat quietly watching her , in her office , while she walked about going over exasperatedly her attempts to talk to Odendaal . His alert patience had the effect of taking the place of her own customary manner in that office ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she listened to others . It was a curious kind of release , almost a pleasure , that created ease between them . He had ready what he was going to say , but a natural respect for the views of others made him hear out what might modify his own . There were homely colloquialisms in his command of English , a little out-of-date , with its careful grammatical construction , in comparison with the spliced improvisations  --  TV jargon , Afrikaans and tsotsi slang , mothertongue syntax , mixed with English  --  of city people like Oupa or the Foundation 's black lawyers . ? Odendaal wo n't budge . We can abandon any idea of that nature . Our only possibility is to sup with the devil . Take a long spoon . Yes . . . The agents of the Government who put us in our position are the ones we must shame into getting us out of it. - - Count on the Provincial Administration ? Well . . . - - Odendaal has threatened to bring the AWB* with their guns to evict us . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present political climate , the Government surely does n't want too many press reports of blacks being forced out of their homes . That still going on. - - Their hands would look clean . It would be the work of the right-wing rebels. - - Even so . They 'd be asked why they did n't do something about it . That 's where we step in . Take the bull by the horns .  | He applied to the TPA* to build a black township on his land , we apply now to the TPA to appropriate the farm and declare it a transit settlement , for a start. - - Worth a try . Our case would be that it 's an initiative to avoid violence in an area of dangerous contention . I suppose we could lead with this . Making light of their conspiracy ' , they grasped hands that day ; sat down together over the formulation . That other clasp , two hands joined to make one creature , broke apart . Out of bed she stumbled to find the sling bag with the address and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She summoned the well-trained orderliness of her working mode in order not to think  --  anythingnot to ask of herself the name of one of the nine dead until she reached the telephone and heard it answered . Zeph Rapulana was a squatter but he had given her the number of a relative in a nearby township who had a store and lived behind it ; there was a telephone , whether in the house or the store she did n't know . It must have been in the store , and so early in the morning the store was not yet open . The telephone rang and rang . It seemed to her an answer : Rapulana would never reply again , anywhere . She called through the bathroom door to Ben in the shower , something terrible has happened , she has to go at once  --  he came to the doorway streaming . ? What ? What is it all about ? What happened ? ? Hle naked , she dressed , it was an encounter between strangers . Ile called out after her , Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But she was alone . He did n't know the man , Zeph Rapulana . Ile had n't stood before Odendaal 's anger , Odendaal 's barred p 1 14 door , with him , made decisions affecting families with him , had n't come to read the dignity , the shrewdness of confidence and intelligence in that calm black face of the man . She drove first to the empty Foundation  --  no one at work yet  --  to pick up documents relating to the Odensville affair . Well along the highway , she remembered she had not left a note , and turned off at a petrol station to telephone her office . The young switchboard operator could hear the voices of the petrol attendants , laughing and arguing over a game of cards set out on the ground , and the jabber from their radio . ? Where you partying already , in the day , Mrs Stark ! She drove ; a mind caged back and forth between the witness of the empty office where Zeph Rapulana had talked reason and strategy , the desk from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the collage , made up of so many press photographs , so many leaping and falling , running figures on TV , so many burning shacks , so many dead slumped on the earth as so many bundles of blood-stained washing . There was no connection . Before a reply to the letter , hers and Rapulana 's , could be received through the authorities , before bureaucracy had taken steps ' , the solution to everything had taken steps  --  deaths , again deaths . The car door slammed behind her outside the district police station with the blow of sun striking her with dizziness of the long solitary drive . Dust , sparkle of the wire security fence ; she passed under a drowsy-lidded gaze of a black policeman with his sub-machine-gun hitched on his stout thigh . Inside , a white policeman , elbows on the counter and forearms shielding his flirtatious face over the telephone , was engaged in one of those calls made up of sniggering silences and intimately curt remarks between young men and girls . Another policeman was standing before a filing cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he continued to glance sideways at p 115 this sheet and that ; shrugged without answering and called towards an open doorway through which someone of more senior rank appeared . He was a handsome Afrikaner with a glossy moustache and a Napoleon haircut , a well-groomed stallion of the kind with a special manner when dealing with women , since he felt himself to be pleasing to them somewhere under their complaint or distress , like it or not , in their female innards . Even to this tannie* he extended the patronage , listening to her rap of questions with the air , yes , yes , he knew how to deal with over-anxious ladies concerned about their black servants . That business with the squatters last night ; nine deaths confirmed but no names available , the bodies still to be identified ? if the relatives can be found , you never know with them , they 're spread around in these camps . He scribbled the name of the Foundation without reaction to her revealed connection with that trouble-making organization ; yes yes they could phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of any assistance . Ile cuffed the head of the young man at the telephone as he passed to his office . She drove to a complex of garage , chain restaurant and restrooms in a loop off the highway and found a bank of telephones . At the store , someone who sounded like a child listened , breathing gustily , and then put aside the receiver . Vera called loudly , hullo ! hullo ! possessed by a useless impatience with everyone , the police , the unknown storekeeper , the wild-goose chase of calling culpability to account , finding interstices in official obduracy and solutions to ignorance of the uneducated that was , had been so long , her working life . The gaping receiver at the other end of the line , the background noises lazily conveyed , p 1 16 ignoring her  --  this was nothing but another customary irritation , but it brought her to despair and destroyed the control within which she held the fact of nine unnamed dead . If that child had been within reach she would have struck it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill , kill back . If they killed that good man , why not deal back death to them  --  she understood with all her impatient angry flesh the violence that , like others , she called mindless . When the receiver was picked up she gave her name and business testily . A man 's soft hoarse voice said no , it 's all right , my cousin is well , everything it 's all right , nothing is happen , if you want see him I can send someone She was given instructions to find her way to the shop . Lost , turned back by police road-blocks , she found another route ? there it was , so that was it , she remembered dropping him off at that store the first day when they had left Odendaal 's house . He was there , standing , waiting for her , wearing a tie , right arm in a sling and , oozing through gauze , the pursed red lips of a deep cut drawn together by surgical clips on the black flesh of his cheek . Smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the man was alive . She began to shiver  --  not tremble  --  it was the quivering wave that comes when you give way to fear or are going to be sick . Certainty that he had been killed by Odendaal , that she had not allowed to rise in her , now struck at the sight of him . ? I 'm so sorry . You were worried . My cousin told me. ? A gentle and calm voice . She stood there , someone dropped from another planet , the outer space of safety , in the dim little store 's light moted by the dust of grain and spilt sugar , thick with the closed-in smells of the night , snuff , soap , sweat-dried secondhand shoes and army  | surplus coats , mouse-droppings and paraffin . He saw , came over at once and with his left hand strangely clasped her forearm above the wrist , held it there , between them . Tentatively , her other hand came to rest over his . He tramped before her to a shed behind the shop . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had slept . He turned off a radio and gave some instruction to a child who brought cups of sweet milky tea . She did n't ask whether the squatters had approached Oden-daal 's house armed with stones and weapons . She did n't ask if lie led them . He told drily , now and then touching with a middle finger along the gash on his cheek , how Odendaal and his commando had gone through the squatters ' shacks , firing , dragging people out . A pause , tracing the gash . A considering , rumbling murmur , expressive in his own language , that she understood from experience with blacks who have status in their communities as always some sort of warning or preparation for what was about to be said . ? Now Administration will act . Now they 'll have to buy his land . No more trouble for him . Lucky Odendaal . He 'll get money , plenty of money , he 'll be happy . And the land -- Their eyes held , and shifted . ? Nine dead , so we 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man . ? We 'll have to make sure it 's for occupation by your people there , no one else. - - Quickly . When shall I come to the office ? I 'd better bring the Chief with me , it 's always better for Pretoria if anything is backed by a chief . First I have to make the funeral arrange-ments . She had no preparatory murmur such as he could use . Perhaps near escapes from death are always a resurrection . Perhaps that 's how the whole legend of Christ rising from the  | tomb came about  --  I was thinking , they took him down from the cross and could n't believe he was n't dead , could n't believe he was there , alive , in front of them . . . that was the resurrection , really . The whole tomb story , the miracle came from that. ? Then she remembered he was probably religious . When they first met , that day they went to see Odendaal , the man had about him the kind of modest self-righteousness , prim bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to bring about in rural people ; at the roadside he sat circumspectly as if he were in a pew . This surface had burned off like morning fog in the heat of the events in which he was involved , as she had come to know him  --  or rather as he had come to reveal himself released by that involvement . Yet beliefs inculcated in childhood often remain uncontradicted by mature reasoning and experience . He might be offended by a Christian heretic 's doubts of Christ 's divine powers . He understood she was talking about  --  himself . ? I managed to drive . I took two of them to the hospital in my car . There 's blood all over . The woman died before we arrived around midnight . Yes . . . The youngster may be all right . That 's how I got this stitched up. ? He moved his lower jaw against the stiffness of the flesh drawn together on his cheek . In Vera 's car they went to what had been Odensville . A stunned aftermath of disaster slowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing , just breathing . Children with lolling-headed babies on their backs sat about , there was no way of knowing whether outside where they had lived  --  every element that could identify shelter and possessions cast in turmoil . Dried tears were the salty tracks on the grey-black cheeks of women who must not be gazed at . Men wandered , turning over splintered wood , torn board , plastic burned black-edged p 119 into fantastic whorls and peaks like the frozen waves in Japanese sprints . A sewing machine under kicked-aside crazy mounds of pots and clothing was an artifact uncovered from a destroyed culture . To Vera 's eyes it had never seemed that the squatter camps she had been in could represent what anyone would be able to regard as home . Now in the destruction of the wretched erections of rubbish-dump materials she saw that these were home , this place had been home . He talked quietly to people ; he and she did not speak to one another , everyone ignored her , as if she could not be seen , the events of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . What happened . There are always explanations expected . ? I ca n't . . . You can read in the papers what happened , you 'll see on TV what the place looks like now . That 's all . Who has ever explained what a war is like  --  everyone witnesses something different . Ben had a fingernail in his ear , something worrying him in the aperture ; the private moment like an offended inattention . She tried again . ? When you 're there yourself , it 's not anything you 've thought . And everyone who went there would know something else . . . it would n't be the same for you as for me , or for others as for you. - - Is n't it that you did n't live through the night there. ? The tone of one who assumes he knows the other better than she could know herself . ? No no . No no . That 's obvious . It 's not what I 'm trying to talk about. ?  | ? After the event : is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not something different : consequences . It 's not the first time you 've seen such things . In her office she dictated to a tape recorder an account of on-site investigation of the Odensville attack . It came back to her desk with neat margins and headings in the flat print-out of a computer . As she read it over for secretarial errors it seemed what Ben had annoyed , almost hurt her , by describing as having been a routine part of case work . The pain of catatonic inertia , yet another aspect of despair in addition to the many she already understood , was a terrible knowledge she would carry , because she never could be , never could wish to be inured to feeling by professionalism . That was what happened at Odensville ; that she understood . The other happening was something she came to realize slowly , returned to as a distraction from work and all the preoccupations of her life , interrupting , like a power failure of all the main lines of consciousness and memory , seeking a new connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the brain that may go unused through a lifetime . At first , with a beat that was half-distaste , half-fear , it came to her suddenly that the gesture of the man , grasping her arm , and her automatic placing of her hand , for a moment , over his knuckles , was a repetition of the compact to begin a love affair with her Hitler Baby , Otto , years ago . Yes  --  that had been a sexual question-and-answer by sudden contact , but the advance of this other man towards her and his assumption of the right to touch her strangely , her hand placed over his , was something quite other . And yet again quite different from shaking hands , which also has as little to do with any kind of intimacy as greeting by the shoulder-bobbing accolade has to do with kissing . Any kind of intimacy ? She turned away from the problem of interpretation again and again . Certainly not sexual . She kite% p 121 without doubt from the impulse in the hand that had gone out to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual invitation . She knew , even in the tight warm grasp of his big hand , that the gesture from him was not sexual ; the nerves of skin and flesh instantly recognize the touch of sensuality . Good god , was she not too old ? Was n't it even ridiculous , a vanity , that she should imagine this gesture could have been any repetition of the other ? She had sometimes feared , in the want , the involuntary yearning of her body for the man Otto , for One-Twenty-One , after he had gone , that when she began to grow old she would become one of those women who have a fancy for voting men , that she would dye her hair and undress in the dark to hide drooping buttocks and sad belly from a lover paid w it h  --  what ? Gold weights and silk shirts are only the beginning.Thank god , no sign of any taste for young men was occurring ; the passing mistrust of self projected upon the commanding outer reality of a community only just breathing under its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slashed cheek driving while a woman was dying on the back seat  --  what meaning could the mistrust of self have , what reality , standing against that ! To whom could she pose the very inappropriateness of any personal preoccupation arising from a situation where all individuality as in dissolution in terror and despair . Not the lover-husband In whom she used to tell  --  or thought she had  --  everything . Only In herself . First the schoolgirl confessional falls away , then the kind of friendships with men and women where , the awareness roles , confidences are regretted as weapons handed to others ; finally , the bliss of placing the burden of self on the beloved rent out to be undeliverable . The beloved is unknown at any address , a self , unlike a bed , can not be shared , and can not be shed . In the weeks that followed when Zeph Rapulana was back p 122 and forth at the Foundation on the matter of Odensville she slowly came to understand  --  not so much thinking about it as accepting , unknowingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that what had disturbed her as a mimesis of the past was the beginning of some new capability in her , something in the chemistry of human contact that she was only now ready for . This country black man about whose life apart from his place in the Odensville case she knew nothing ( wife , children , web of relatives and friends ) already had this capability . That was why he was able to claim her with what was neither a sexual caress nor an impersonal handshake such as they customarily exchanged . He understood her fear that he was dead was an indication that for reasons not to be explained , nor necessary to try to explain , he was not one more individual at risk in the course of her work . There was between them a level of knowledge of one another , tranquil , not very deep , but quite apart from those relationships complicated and profound , tangled in their beings , from which each came to it , a level that was neither sexually intuitive nor that of friendship . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived so far were an obstacle to the shared references of ordinary friendship . She a middle-class city woman  --  that was as much decisive as whiteness , ordering the services of her life by telephone or fax , taking for granted a secretary and a bay for her car at the office ; his status in his rural community marked  --  it was not difficult to picture from experience of these places  --  by neat clothes hanging on a wire and the small pile of books and papers in a shack  --  what did they share of the familiar , outside the Odensville affair ? His sexuality in late middle-age was no doubt satisfied elsewhere ; although it was clear , from the sense even of her reserved persona behind her office desk , that her whiteness would not be  | taboo for him , or his blackness for her , sex had no part in their perception of each other except that it recognized that each came from a base of sexual and familial relations to a meeting that had nothing to do with any of these . Vera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to  --  involved in the being of a man to whom she knew no sexual pull . And it was not that she did not find him physically attractive ; from the first time he sat across from her desk , his face wide-modelled and firm as polished ( basalt , his heavy but graceful back as he walked out of a room , his hands resting calmly palm-down on his thighs as he spoke , brought her reassurance she had not known she no longer found elsewhere with anyone . It was as if , in the commonplace nature of their continuing contact through the Foundation , they belonged together as a single sex , a reconciliation of all each had experienced , he as a man , she as a woman .  | Didymus 's left eye flickered open while the other stayed gummed with sleep . In the artificial night when curtains kept out the early morning  --  she stood , a burglar caught in the act . The eye held her . But this was no intruder : Sibongile off an early plane , the swirl on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought her home turned in the empty street . She released herself . Put down the suitcase . He closed the bleary greeting ashamedly , better pretend to be asleep , drop back into sleep . She drew the suitcase on its wheels across the carpet , fluttered papers and clicked objects against surfaces . Then the waterfall of the shower in the bathroom . The bed dipped to the side as she entered . He knew she wanted him to know she was trying not to wake him : as if she were not there ; or had never been away . He spoke . How was it ? He could n't dredge up in his mind where she had been sent , where was it this time , Japan , Libya , not the UN , no . Better not risk how was Qaddafi . ? Ex-tr-aordinary . She lay willing sleep , all she had heard and done alight  | inside her , could not be extinguished , as he himself had felt when he returned from his missions about which she could not have asked , How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion and negotiation came from her hair and skin as smoke clings to the clothing of one who has been in a crowded room . He scented it as a dog sniffs the shoes of its master to trace where he 's been . She was a stranger and she was as familiar as his own body ; that must have been how he was for her , those years when he came and went ; if he thought of it at all , he had thought that was how it was ; something for women . She slept , suddenly , with a snorting indrawn breath . This body beside him invaded the whole bed , lolled against him . His own felt no stir of desire for it . He must have slept . Both woke at the sound of the door *lamming as Mpho left for school , and Sibongile was out of bed instantly , padding over in her slippery nightgown to the halfdisgorged suitcase and packages on the floor . ? Look what I found for you. ? People are happy bringing the consolation of presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( he saw at first ) , no , a walkingstick , ebony , carved with a handle in the form of a closed fist over a ring , and chased all down the shaft to a copper ferrule . Is n't it great ? Look at the work that 's gone into it . I knew you 'd love it . I 'd looked everywhere in the market but I had so little time  --  and then there was this damned hawker pestering outside the hotel , one day the moment he held it up I knew , That 's for you . See  --  all carved in one piece She loved it , she sat back on the bed as he received the . tick from her and followed its features under her eyes , her feet with magenta-painted toenails waving , her thighs shaping shifting curve 's of shine on the satin that covered them ( he always had  | been proud of her clothes , her ingenuity in devising the appearance of flamboyant luxury , even to go to bed in , even when they were poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds and ends ) . ? And look at the grain , here , these lighter stripes going down the fingers  --  is n't that amazing  --  and feel how solid He duly held the object horizontally , raised from the pillows , weighing it on his palms . ? Where shall I hang it ? Above the desk , or here over the door perhaps . She slapped her thighs , sending the satin shivering . ? It 's not an ornament ! It 's to walk with ! Keep your weight down ! Do n't think I bring you presents without a double motive , dear ? Her voice climbed its scale of laughter . She swung herself off the bed and he could hear her going from room to room , inspecting the traces of her absence , closing cupboard doors in Mpho 's little room , clanging the kitchen bin shut on something he or Mpho had neglected to throw away . The walking-stick rested across his chest . He opened his eyes . She appeared in the bedroom doorway , as she had from a distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms crossed under her breasts . ? Are n't you getting up ? - - What 's the hurry. - - Oh come on . I 'm hungry . So she wanted him there in the kitchen to deliver to him a lecture on the results of her trip while they prepared breakfast together . She was trying it out on him  --  he was a comrade , experienced in such presentations , after all  --  before she prepared a report . It has been an assignment in Africa  --  where else could that stick have come from  --  she 'd been sent to negotiate the takeover by that country 's Government of a school for exiles ' children and various other buildings the Movement had had there . The National Executive left it to her diplomacy to see p 127 whether these assets , no longer needed , should be handed as a gift to a country that had given asylum , or whether it might be possible to expect some sort of compensation  --  the Swedes had funded the school and added living quarters for the teachers , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government donated the land . ? Dinner with the President , flowers sent to my hotel room and all ( I like it better when they send fruit , but only Europeans do that , aih , on our continent people do n't think fruit 's a treat ) . A lo-ong explanation from him on how we should run things here , my God , if you wrote out all the advice we get it would circle the world  --  not a word about any compensation deal for the property . The next day there was the great ceremony of the handing-over , President 's guard , military band , more speeches , mine as well , but the best I could do when I got the Minister in his office was to get out of him the promise of an agricultural training project , quite small , they 'd arrange for a few students we could send up there , tuition free but living expenses our responsibility . I do n't think I can recommend that as worth taking up ? Better that I come back with empty pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp ? She signalled two slices of bread to be put in the toaster . She went into one of her repertoire of elaborate gestures , throwing hands wide , bringing them together with a slight clap that mocked the attitude of prayer , leaning elbows on the kitchen table with a slumping sigh . ? Did you see Matthew or Tatamkulu ? - - Who ... - - You know. - - Not there any more. - - So you ( lid go. - -I had instructions . Just delivering I did n't ask what ? p 128 some documents. ? It was said as if this were to be the last word on the subject . But he , not she , had once operated in that camp , it was one of the periods when he disappeared from the exiled homes they occupied in Europe and Africa . His was a right to ask about that camp where spies who infiltrated the Movement were imprisoned , although it was not a subject for general discussion . Recently there had been released by the Movement a public report of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to come out he had thought he 'd better tell her what he had never told her : that for a time , a desperate time when the Freedom Fighters and the Movement itself were in great danger by infiltration , he had been an interrogator-yes  --  a jailer , there . He 'd told her the code names of others who were running the place and how two of them had joined him , eventually , in protest against the methods being used to extract information . She knew , all right , about whom he was enquiring when he mentioned those names . ? It 's not closed down , then . She lifted her chin and blinked wearily . ? In the process of . I did n't see much sign of life. - - Did anyone say what arrangements are made when inmates are released , who is it that brings them back here ? Is it the government agencies who sent them to infiltrate  --  or are they just being abandoned , that sort of outfit wants to pretend it never existed , these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used against us in other ways . Recycled . . . Well , we could n't think that far ahead ; there were a lot of things we could n't think about in that place. - - No one talked to me , I handed over what I had to . That was that. - - It 's not like you to be satisfied to be a messenger. ? He put plates in the sink , his back to her ; turned his head . p 129 She was yawning and yawning as if her jaw would dislocate with the force and she wandered out of the kitchen . Gone back to bed to sleep off the journey : but no , she appeared , dressed , eyes made-up , briefcase and keys in her hand , on her way to her office . He sat in his pyjamas over the mug of coffee he had reheated for himself . Ashamed , was that it ? She was ashamed that he had ever been involved in that camp where the methods of extracting information by inflicting pain and humiliation learnt from white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims . Ashamed , even though he 'd finally got himself out of the place , refused to carry on there . Refused , yet understood why others could do the terrible things they did ; she was a woman , after all , she could understand revolution but she did n't understand war . He sat on in the kitchen aware of the irritating drizzle of the tap he had not fully closed but unable to distract himself by getting up to turn it off . No . Not ashamed ; wary of her political position , calculating that since his code name had not been listed in the public report , she was not tainted , through her connection with him , under the necessity of leadership to discipline and perhaps in some cases expel from the Movement anyone who was involved . Unspeakable : even the subject , for Sibongile . She does not want , even in private , any reminders , any familiarity with names , from him . She has her position to think of . He had the curious remembered image , alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sole of her shoe all traces of a dog 's mess she had stepped into . She had made the bed and placed the walking-stick on the cover . Mpho had ear-rings and trinkets from her mother 's part in delegations to a number of countries ; he had this . Its to walk  | 0 with . A present for a retired man , who should be content to pass time pleasantly taking exercise . Sally Maqoma chose the restaurant and is known to the waiters . She orders sole . ? You know how I like it , grilled , not swimming in butter or oil , and plenty of lemon , bring a whole lemon. ? She and her old friend Vera Stark have tried many times to get together ( as they term it ) and for once Sally has a free hour to squeeze between morning appointments and a meeting in Pretoria at two-thirty for which a driver will pick her up . They talk politics on a level of shared references  --  Vera through her work and connections is privy to most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there can be no contact  --  but Sally rarely lets slip any political confidences . Vera is aware of this and knows how to respect evasions while yet interpreting them . As they eat , and drink mineral water Sally has been advised by her doctor to take copiously , Vera is both listening to her friend and piecing together rumours to fill lacunae in the spontaneity of the discourse . What Sally does n't say suggests or is meant to suggest that the delegation to Pretoria ( Sally has spoken of the three of us ' having hastily to go there ) is to meet some Government minister on the education crisis , but it might well be that the meeting was one of those of the Movement rumoured to be taking place with right-wing groups at those groups ' request . Vera tried to superimpose the bearded and sidewhiskered outline of a figure in commando outfit over the lively , sceptical black face so voluble opposite her . She could try a general question . ? Is there anything in the newspaper speculation that the AWB and their kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head forward comically . ? Sounds unlikely. ? She took a lung draught and , as she  | put the glass down close to Vera Stark 's hand , let her touch nudge it . ? Everything unlikely has become likely . That 's our politics these days . In their laughter the side-current of family lives surfaced , the intimacy of the times in one another 's four walls when they had pooled their children , danced to Didy 's records ; the weeks when , on return from exile , the Maqomas had moved in with the Starks . ? Did I tell you , some changes . Ivan 's divorced , and Ben 's father 's living with us now. - - Oh naughty Ivan . Young people are not like us , no staying power . But I remember , she was n't much of a personality , you said . . . ? It must n't be too good for you , having the old man in the house. - - I 've always got on all right with him but he needs time , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Vera , you ca n't do it , you must n't . You 've got more important things . . . I 'm sure I can find someone for you , there 're always people coming round my office , out-of-work nurses , nice elderly mamas , long-lost cousins , God knows what  --  I 'll find someone who can live in , that 's what you need. - - I do n't know . D' you know it 's going to be awful to be really old , no one wants to touch you any more , no one likes the smell of your skin , no one ever kisses you . . . And Ben 's never loved his father , it seems . Some sort of resentment from childhood , you know those mysteries no one but the one who was himself the child can understand. - - Ben ? Really ? Ben 's such a darling , such an affectionate man . The limits of confidences between two people constantly shift , opcnirrg here , there closing off one from the other . Vera Stark could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | loved , Ben loves , only me ; loves in Ivan only me , and what shall I do with that love ? The thought rising like a wave of anxiety trapped in voices at a restaurant full of people ; no place to deal with it . ? I hear Didy 's commissioned to do a book . A history of the exile period , is it ? - - He 's supposed to be researching . Do n't ask me . . . Let 's order coffee ? Sally had the alert shifting glance of a bird on a tree-top , surveying the comings and goings of waiters . When the coffee came she arranged the cups and poured , measuring out words with the flow . ? Half the time he does n't even get up in the mornings . I go to work , I do n't know what time he gets round to shaving and so on . Always some pain or ache . When I say in the evening , how did it go today  --  I mean , Vera , I 'm showing interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people who can give him material , whether he 's organizing his notes ? then he 'll say something like , How did what go ? To put me down . To imply I 'm humouring him . . . Because of where I 've been all day , at headquarters . Is what happened my fault ? Can I help it ? He 's got to stop this wallowing in self-pity . I can tell you ( her eyes shifted focus , round the neighbouring tables , where other people 's talk and self-absorption made a wall of protection ) I 'm beginning to find it disgusting . He does n't realize that ; it disgusts me . This confidence almost alarms ; to meet it means it should be matched , and Vera does not know , does not yet understand , what it is exactly that she needs to confide , or if that impulse is any longer something to be heeded . Who can give answers ? A bearded man in a preacher 's dog-collar stood in the doorway , How mean of you Vera . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How can anyone be expected to accept that about himself . Sally made a fist above her cup , she was shaking her head p 133 vehemently . ? That 's just the problem . He does think he 's history . He 's copping out because he 's not centre stage any more , he sees himself as history and history stops with him . He wo n't accept that it goes on being made and we all have to make it , my part has changed , his part has changed . He 's still a living man who has work to do even though it ca n't be what he 'd choose. - - Writing a history ? That 's the past . Sally leant on the table in silence but did not let it widen between them . ? I came back from a trip  --  a mission  --  you 'd think I 'd never been away . He does n't bring me home . They are not two young women , after all , exchanging bedroom secrets . Vera may take the odd phrase as some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she 's white , she has never known what exiles have , the return of your man from god knows where doing god knows what he had to do ( Didymus 's name as someone connected with one of those camps luckily has n't become public ) . She may or may not have understood what Sally is saying . Didymus does n't bring her home by making love to her , as she used to , for him . When Didymus did make the approaches of love-making Sibongile felt no response . Mpho had appeared from her room one evening charmed  --  in the sense of talented , gifted  --  with youth . The clarity of the lines of her body in a scrap of a dress , of her lips and long shining eyes with their fold of laughter at the outer corners , the cheap , wooden-toy ear-rings in the shape of parrots hanging from the delicate hieroglyph of her ears ? she was the embodiment of happiness . Waiting to be called for ; where was she going ? A party , there were so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the friends with whom p 134 she was apparently so popular . A girl-friend bustled in to fetch her , they chattered their way out . A thin chain looped through a pendant lay curled on the table where she had dropped it after lifting it from her neck over her carefully arranged hair when the friend pulled a face : the pendant clashed with the ear-rings . Didymus poured the chain from hand to hand , smiling . He came into the kitchen where Sibongile stood stirring a stew and , with the pretext of looking to see what was in the pot , leant his chin on her shoulder . His hand came round over her belly that was swelled forward as she moved the meat about with a fork , circled the navel in a half-humorous caress in anticipation of a meal , and then moved down over her pelvis a moment . After they had eaten she seated herself at the computer they had bought for his work on the history of exiles . Staring at the luminous waver of the screen a moment , arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that day at all ; she turned to him . ? Go ahead. ? He chose to understand that she was asking whether he needed the machine now . She spilled out and sorted her papers exasperatedly . He switched on the TV , volume low in order not to disturb concentration on whatever it was she was writing . Swells of music and the exaggerated pitch of broadcast emotions emanated from where he sat , as she removed from and inserted words and phrases in a speech she was due to deliver in a few days . His back faced her every time she lifted her eyes from the juggled text swimming in phosphorescence ; something about the droop of the head showed that he was n't seeing , he was n't hearing . Didymus was asleep , carried along , unconscious , like a drunk at a carnival , in the meaningless impersonal familiarity of the medium that invades everywhere and recognizes no one . In their bed he took up the caress begun in the kitchen .  | His hand slid from her hips pressing firmer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pubis , working fingers through the hair and slipping the index one , as if by chance , to touch through the lips . She flung back the covers and swerved out of bed , the mooring of his hand torn away . She stalked about the room with the air of looking for something and when aware of him watching her went out into the other rooms . She came back and offered : ? Verandah light was n't left on for Mpho. - -I turned it on. - - You didn't. - - My memory , these days . . . ? She lay beside him , not saying goodnight in case this provided an opening for him to try to rouse her again . That night , or another night , she woke in a tension of sadness in which she and he were lost together , bound , sunk . The sound of their breathing strung tight between them but the divide of darkness could not be crossed , the weight of fathoms could not be lifted . He had not forgotten the light for Mpho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this stupid little spite was actual between her ribs , something conjured up from the religious pictures pasted to the kitchen walls in her grandmother 's house in Witbank location , where she grew up . She seemed to be living simultaneously in the hum of the night all the images , the moments when she had been most aware of him , scattered through the years . Parted so often ; what happens in these partings , his , now hers , in the one who goes away ? Is the one who left ever the one who comes back ? There are changes in understanding and awareness that can occur only when one is alone , away from containment in the shale of self outlined by another . Such p 136 changes can never be shared . Alone with them for ever . The images are postcards sent from countries that exist only in the personality of the subject ; you will never visit them . She had to make sure that he was there , some version of himself , even as a shrouded bulk under the bedclothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead , the hand pressed against a cheek , the neck below the ear , where a pulse answers . She rested her spinal column back to back along the length of his and felt him break wind as he slept .  | The old man occupied Annick 's room , so she would have to take what had been Ivan 's and the friend she was bringing would have to share it with her . Ivan 's luxury had been a double bed across which he liked to stretch diagonally his adolescent sprawl . Vera bought a divan to move into the room to accommodate the friend . The old man 's presence already had changed the balance of the house . Sally forgot or had been too busy to fulfil her offer but connections at the Foundation supplied a relative in need of work ; the path of the old man 's movements , on the arm of the woman who came to help him every day , intersected and deflected those of Vera and Ben . Vera 's house had the transparent grids of various presences laid upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose military kit propped against her dressing-table left in the varnish a dent whose cause was forgotten , the clandestine movements Bennet brought in as a lover and established in usage as husband and father , the route the children used to take , out of the window in Annick 's room and in through the back stoep door to get at potato chips in the kitchen cupboard without alerting parents , and the invisible trails of Vera herself , changing the function of p 138 a space by bringing Blue Books and White Papers to occupy what had held model plane kits and threadbare stuffed animals , closing windows room by room in a storm , carrying , as if following back in footsteps that have worn grooves in the wood floor of her house , an old photograph to the light . On her barefoot morning scamper to the bathroom the old man might cross her path , wavering ahead with his paralysed hand dangling curled at his side and the other held before him as a blind man senses for obstacles . He was not blind but formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one ready to receive a handshake greeting , because even that side of his body had not survived the stroke unimpaired and it took time and effort to muster the appropriate muscles when the occasion came . She had to remember to wear a gown , as she had done when there were still children at home and a live-in maid coming early from the kitchen to house-clean . He wandered with a smile of strange sweetness from encounter to encounter , not that he had become simple-minded but because he was reliving the sense of achievement a child has when first it masters how to walk , and the house represented to him territory daily conquered . He did not seem to mind the wheedling patter of Thandeka , who winked and gesticulated behind his back in comment on his infirmity and pride in his progress . How is he today , Ben would enquire of her in the presence of his father ; and the hand that he might have touched sank uncertainly out of the way . He bought his father specialist journals and newspapers that should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and left them on the table beside the old man 's chair in lieu of a visit . The woman attendant decided , as part of her responsibility for the old man 's care , what he felt . ? Mama , he 's so happy for his granddaughter corning , I tell you , mama ! That time she is arrive lie 's going to he there , there , p 139 mama ! So happy ! Mama , I 'm going to put a nice suit he 'll wear Brought forward on her arm with abstract joy expressed on his behalf as smiling nuns set themselves to beam radiance of the holy spirit and politicians display their amorphous love of humankind , he looked uncertain , for a moment , which of the two young women who arrived was his granddaughter . He had not seen her since she was a high-school girl ; but the face , the face of his son , there in hers , was surely unmistakable . Vera and Ben had somehow omitted to mention to her that the grandfather was living with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other had done something neither had . But Annick kissed him , took the old hand  --  cold scaly skin like that of a tortoise she 'd kept as a pet as a child  --  placed it in that of the friend with her , using the childhood form of address . ? Grandpops , this is Lou , she 's in biology and she 's just come from a month on your old stamping ground , was n't it  --  Zaire  --  the Congo . His voice snagged on the effort to speak , but he turned the pause into a mock appeal to Vera . ? Of course this young lady 's in biology , we all are biological  --  what does that mean she does , though ? ? He enjoyed his little quip and the polite laughter it brought ; Ben only smiled , his black eyes unreadable . The granddaughter cuffed her friend lightly so that the girl shook her drape of hair like a mare stung by a fly ; both had long hair , but the straight black tresses Annick had from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? Grandpops she 's a professor , she 's been doing important research up there , fascinating , we 'll tell you about it. - - Do n't you believe her , Mr Stark . When we 're at home and I start to talk microbiology to her , her eyes glaze over , all she wants to know about Zaire is what tapes I 've brought for her , what kind of drums and strings you can still hear there. ? p 140 Annick with their two carry-ails followed Vera to Ivan 's room while the friend took her tea over to the old man and settled for a talk about Zaire . The timidity with which the relation with adult children  --  actuality defies the oxymoron  --  is taken up when they return from their lives , surrounded Vera . Each time Annick appeared after absence she was the sudden live manifestation of someone fixed in a painting . The static features in the mind were moving , the details of the texture of the skin , the glance  --  what is she apprehending , at once , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was once one of us ? Her scent  --  not perfume but the smell of her that vaguely reaches back to the odour of her hair when she was observed , sleeping , as a child , by one leaning to hear her breathe . Something missing in that beautiful face ? Must n't be seen to be gazing for it . Not a change in the line of eyebrows ; these are never plucked , they are definitive , seal-smooth and glossy , each tapering at the temple 's hollow . Ben 's sperm made her like that , in his image . Not the frizzing , though that hair-style 's a pity ; it 's nothing that 's been altered : something that 's gone . But the last opening with which to take up the relationship with daughter or son is to pass some remark about physical appearance . Perhaps one should tell , not ask . Offer , not request . Put oneself in their hands , the exchildren . Place there the mystery of the totally unexpected : what am I to do with that love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain it . Or to place , putting down carefully , a container of secret calm come out of an exaggerated fear of the death of someone not lover , husband , child : what would this young woman who was surely closer than any other woman make of that ? And all the time Vera was talking in the usual flitting , lightly anxious and excited way of someone wanting to make sure guests p 141 would be comfortable . The cupboard was cleared for clothes , the old man would share the main bathroom so the second one was all theirs , the daughter 's and her friend 's . ? Sorry the room 's crowded . But with full house now , no other bedroom , it 's all I could do , I bought the divan . Annick thumped the carry-ails on it . She gave a sigh of pleasure as she recognized some poster of her brother 's era that was still on the wall . ? Oh you should n't have bothered . We always sleep in a double bed . The androgynous harmony present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's femininity , her breasts under a loose sweater shrugged together by crossed arms , her pelvis and hips shaped in tight jeans , distracted Vera , she was conscious of something impossible trying to come to her . Instead , a sudden distraction : she realized what was missing in that seductive face . The black punctuation of that beauty , placed exactly as Bennet 's was , below the spread of eyelashes shading the left cheekbone . ? What happened to your beauty spot ? Annie laughed instructively . ? The mole . I had it off . No beauty ; moles should be removed , they can turn cancerous , Ma . The usual party to celebrate a son 's or daughter 's visit . The usual people , Legal Foundation familiars  --  Ben 's new associates in the luggage business remained business acquaintances he did n't particularly want to bring home  --  the old friends , oncebanned political activists now turned politicians at negotiating tables , and the addition , among the returned exiles , of those whom definitive indemnity at last allowed to disembark without fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half-home . A few diplomats of middle rank , useful conduits to p 142 overseas funding , now appeared , a member of one of the UN commissions sent to monitor violence in the country ; and there was a presence perhaps no one except young Oupa could place , a man introduced by Vera as Zeph Rapulana . He sat all evening in the same chair , while groups formed and broke up in and out of the garden and living-room ; coming and going with drinks and food she was aware of the shine of the planes of his features sinking into the gathering darkness like the natural outline of a landscape , part of a view she could always expect to see from her house . But people came to that dark unknown figure , drawn in some way ; she noticed them , Didymus , a consul-general , the UN woman whose professional qualification surely was to be enquiring . Annie and her friend Lou , shoes kicked off and feet on the grass , sat on the steps in rising and falling chatter and laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lazar Feldman , the young lawyer from the Foundation . Ben and Vera cast glances over the gatherings in and outdoors as an airline attendant walks down the aisle of a plane discreetly checking whether seat-belts are fastened . They were with every group and no group , and encountered one another apart from others . He put his hand on her shoulder . The night opened a soaring space above them , dwindling the voices and shapes of the human company they had gathered to a low humming horizon , a thin and distant huddle of life stirring under a vast gaze . Was this all they could muster to set against the trajectory of people thrown off trains that morning ; in the house an old man with limbs atrophying ; a ship full of nuclear filth prowling round the shores that night with death at a twelvekilometre limit ? How far is a twelve-kilometre limit , for death , when this great engulfment of sky can not be held off ? They did n't speak but drifted together clown the steps , past the backs and legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden . The  | neglected grass licked dew on their ankles ; she knelt a moment to bury her hands in it , ants crept up her wrists , crickets filled their ears ringingly , restoring the earth 's scale . They strolled on away from their party . ? Lazar seems pretty taken with Annie . I can foresee us being left to entertain the girl-friend from now on . Vera became conscious of the hand on her shoulder as if it had just descended there . ? I do n't think so. - - He 's the kind of man who 'd be right . Appeal to her , surely . He is n't living with some woman , is he ? You usually know what 's happening outside the Foundation. - - No one permanent , far as I know . Girl-friends , passing affairs. - -I 've got a hunch they 'd get on . She has n't some big affair going all this time in Cape Town , has she ? What about that doctor she once introduced us to , Van der Linde ? Would she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it 's all right for teenagers but she 's over thirty . I ca n't believe it is n't a smoke screen for something  --  some love affair with someone who 's married , probably. - - She 's living with this girl . She seems happy. - - That 's why I think there 's some complication with a man . They walked on . There was a stutter of music from the house , a cassette starting and stopped . Vera halted , and he turned , thinking they were about to return to the house . ? Ben , they sleep together . In one bed . The other girl does n't use the divan . Annie said when I took her to the room the day they arrived , they always sleep together. - - My god , what an idea . Childish . She 's a doctor and thirtysomething years old . Why not a teddy-bear , as well. ? p 144 They were approaching the steps , the young people there , the house full of others drinking and eating . ? Would you ever share a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . We ca n't talk now . The party goes on . In the kitchen plates pile on left-over food , Vera washes glasses because Ben 's supply has run out . One or the other , they join this group and that . In a corner of the living-room the stab of interrupting voices vies with the music . A heavy young Englishman in a catfish-patterned dashiki is using the height from which he projects his voice to dominate a discussion on conditions in the liberation movement 's prison camps , which have been the subject of a newspaper expose . ? You ca n't make such sweeping generalizations . Things differed from camp to camp . I myself can say A head was dipped disparagingly . ? As a journalist , from outside. - - Yes , a journalist , poking my nose where it was n't welcome . But I was n't doing so in the capacity of my work . My brother-in-law happens to have been held in two of those camps so I have the picture from outside and inside. - - Your brother-in-law ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry Gwangwa . A small black woman wearing the Western antithesis of her white husband 's outfit , satin trousers and a string of pearls in the neck of her tailored shirt , stood by looking up now and then to others in the manner of one watching the impression he was making . ? But at first they would n't tell you anything , you had to ? Why do you talk of things you know nothing about --   | His soft thick throat throbbed like a frog 's . He did not look at his wife as he spoke . ? My own brother-in-law was beaten on the soles of the feet , he was strung up , in another camp these methods were not used , it was no five-star hotel but . . . all depends on who was in command . I had some contact with him ... what I know is not secondhand . Jerry 's not bitter although how he happened to be subject to all this  --  that 's another story , he should never have been there , while there were plenty who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a good listener who , Vera saw , contributed nothing . He turned away with her as she moved on , and Tola Richards , the journalist 's wife , joined them . ? I did n't know about your brother . She stood , stranded , before Didymus ; before Vera . She gestured with her glass as if about to tip its contents in someone 's face . ? Oh have n't you heard it from Alec before ? It 's his party piece . Whenever there 's someone who does n't know us , he produces his punchline about the brother-in-law so they can be impressed he 's married a black . Do n't you know I 'm his passport ? I 'm his credentials as a white foreigner . Because he can produce me , it means he 's on the right side . That gets him in everywhere . Best thing was to assume she 'd had too much to drink ; Didymus put his arm round her in a hug and said something to her in their own language . The three of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone was waving and beckoning to the young woman and she broke away . Didymus and Vera had nothing to say to one another but were comfortable together at a distance each understood the other could not cross . It was , at least , their distance ; like a place they had once been to , together . He had lied by means of an ambiguous sentence . What he had hidden by it was : I did n't know Jerry Gwangwa was your brother . But p 14 6 I do know he was a plant , a South African police agent , nineteen years old , he was sent with a false record of being detained and escaping to make his way to Tanzania to present himself for military training with Umkhonto . He was to encourage dissatisfaction among the trainees , homesickness and drug-taking , and to inform other agents of the movements of military commanders , so that assassinations could be carried out . He was bloodied before he left home ; he had killed two youth leaders in their beds and planted a car bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth . He was interrogated by Maxi , code name for Didymus Maqoma . He survived , confessed , and having convinced the Americans he was a Freedom Fighter , was studying for a Ph.D . on a scholarship at one of their universities . Vera could not know what Didy 's preoccupation was , in the eye of silence he and she occupied briefly in the late-night animation around them , but she acknowledged it instinctively . In a long life there are many different pockets of collusion that form with different people out of different circumstances and , although generally forgotten , occasionally jingle there a kind of coinage , a handful of tokens good for re-entry to a shared mood . Ben was approaching with an arm round either girl , his daughter and her friend , forced by him into a dancing trot . ? I 'm telling these two , either we get everyone going with some hot music or it 's time to send them all home. ? But he looked deeply tired , the skin around his eyes so dark it seemed each had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mouth chiselled heavily , thickening what had been his beautiful lips into drooping coarseness . Once again at a party  --  as she had seen him as if with the gaze of another , at a party when first he had become lover turned husband  --  she saw him without the lens of her image of him . Annie , smiling under his arm , was the bearer of that face , now ; on him , it was no longer there . Weariness revealed  | him in spite of or because of the youthful energy he was summoning . ? Come , let 's show them. ? In the mountains , with muscles lightly trembling from the day 's climb , the love-making , fresh from the shower , they stood together at the invitation of music . There was the same readying slight movement of his shoulders before he took Vera to dance . The others laughed and applauded his expertise , egging him on . The warmth of his body , private in his clothes , was the warmth of the bed they shared . People were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke away to go to them , trailing his hand for the first few steps . Behind the straggle of Oupa , the Maqomas , Lazar , the Richards and the United Nations envoy , Zeph Rapulana was leaving . She had not had a chance to talk to him the whole night . Sally was embracing her with her usual formula , enthusing ? You know just how to do things , what a good time , we must get together ? and she saw Zeph Rapulana over Sally 's shoulder . His was a calm she could not reach . He was shaking hands with everyone in his countryman 's courtesy . What is a party ? For Vera tonight it is a mass of distraction hiding everyone from themselves , a dose of drink and noise that blocks what you do n't want to think about . We ca n't talk now . That night there was another party . When Ben in pyjama shorts ( still had the figure for them ) went down through the garden to fetch the Sunday paper from its slot in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf clubhouse had been attacked with hand grenades and automatic rifle fire . Four revellers were killed , others injured . He went slowly back to the house , reading the story , aware in peripheral vision of avoiding a couple of ' plates and a beer glass with its dregs filled with p 148 drowned insects , left on the grass by his guests . He sat on the bed , where Vera still lay , staring unseeing at his fine dark-haired legs as he listened to the radio report of reactions to the attack . Horrible , horrible , said a black bishop ; cowardly murder of innocent people , commented a Government spokesman ; savagery due to the Government losing control of blacks , according to the white right-wing . And the whole outcry merely because the victims were white , stated the Movement 's rival organization , neither confirming nor denying responsibility for the attack . ? Dorp connoisseurs. ? Ben ran fingers up and down through hair on his thigh . ? And they do n't know how it came to happen , do they . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if something contrived exactly what would show how out of the incongruity in our lives comes the horror ? That 's just it ! Innocence , they say . I do n't know what that means , any more , if it means we do n't know what 's happening outside a golf course . If people can sit sipping and spitting some Cape vintage innocent ' of the existence for others of guns and bombs . How far away from one another they were , for the clash of incongruity to be so awful. - - Further than we were . If it was a question she did n't seem to hear . Across mown greens and raked bunkers , across veld farmland , the man 's reassuring broad back is leading them , the farmhouse door slams shut . ? If you were to put that clubhouse in some film , some agitprop film , everyone would say it was too contrived , too obvious , too symbolic . Wine and blood . But with us , it happens . Sometimes picking up a garment as if not recognizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? Thank god that crowd has taken responsibility  --  if you do n't deny you 're con- p 149 firming , aih ? That wo n't give anybody the chance to dump blame on the Movement. ? Ben worked his feet into worn moccasins . ? Not a noble satisfaction , I know. - - How would the Movement be thought to go in for that kind of tactic ? With what purpose ? It 's not exactly an act to reassure whites and win their votes when the time comes. ? Vera was making the bed . ? Exactly . That 's why it would be useful to the government , if suspicion could be planted . But once responsibility 's boasted elsewhere  --  with a nice racist ring to it  --  you heard what the APLA* man said : there 's outrage only because the victims are white. - - But that 's true , you know it , Ben . Last week a whole family was gunned down in their sleep . But in a black township not a golf club . Four or five lines on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . And no statement from the ones who 're outraged now. - - You know what my partner would say if you told him that ? What if you 'd been in that clubhouse ? Your wife ? ' - - So we keep the pretence that 's forced upon us by this killing among so many . That everyone deplores , condemns unequivocally etc. - - Yes , yes ! You ca n't support any part of the views of that man , can you At breakfast the young women appeared languidly tousled , their yawns rapidly silenced by the news . ? Imagine , could you possibly imagine how terrified they must have been , for a moment thinking someone was playing a sick joke , and then the person beside you blown to bits . . . better to be killed at once than to know you might be next. ? Annie drew in her lips and hunched p 150 her arms . ? Think of us all last night. ? The two women held hands resting on the table , Annie 's the spatulate-fingered , muchscrubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirtied with nicotine on skin and nails . In a skimpy T-shirt and shorts Lou was seen to be very thin and muscular , the nipples of breasts like a preadolescent 's nobby beneath the clinging shirt , a concave chest between round posts of shoulders . The linked hands were laid out before Ben and Vera ; their eyes drawn to them as the talk went back and forth . Annie was persistent . ? D' you think it could have been us ? - - The bishop said it could have happened in the middle of his service. ? Vera directed herself to the girl Lou ; it was as if she had something to ask her other than what was being said . ? I do n't suppose the fact that we were blacks and whites would make much difference if the object is to create terror . Stop negotiations . But think of the international hullabaloo if the UN representative were to have been killed . Now that would have been something to wake up the outside world to this Govern-ment 's failure to deal with violence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps admiringly , for her mother . ? You do take things coolly ! ? She cocked her head to touch Lou 's , it was the foal 's butting gesture with which as a child she would claim affection and comfort from Ben or Vera . ? Well . . . will you excuse us ? That rather nice Lazar 's asked us to come for a walk on a farm , he 's due to pick us up . Ben was wheeling through stations on the radio for one that might be giving further details of the attack . ? Where 'd they say they 're off to ? - - Lazar 's invited them somewhere. ? p 151 ? Lazar ? Oh. ? We ca n't talk now . He 's sitting in her office against the light ; the still solidity of him . She gets up from her desk to lower a blind and his features emerge , watching , listening . What is it about that face ? The eyes  --  the eyes in repose always have that line of fellowfeeling , a slight lifting crease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can define it to herself . Where does it come from , that expression that is not a smile , that self-assurance that is not concealed arrogance ? There is nothing in her experience of other people to explain this man . Whatever she tries does not fit . Yet she does not need to enter his life with personal enquiries that would become a burden to both , each having to take into account circumstances with which , unlike the Odensville affair , she has nothing to do . ? You once said something . We wo n't harm you or your wife , your family . ' - - Yes . Yes. - - And then he came with his commando and people in the squatter camp were killed. - - Yes . He did. - - Now what about this attack , the night we were all together at my house . When we talked on the phone you said you were shocked , it was a cruel and terrible thing  --  you said . Just as everybody else , we all did . I know you mean what you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust myself . Patient for understanding , he never was waiting to jump in with his own opinions .  - -  - What reason have you not to trust yourself , Vera. ?  | ? The same reason I have not to trust any of us. ? They smiled . ? We all pass deftly from hand to hand the assumption that it 's human life that 's sacred , it 's an unblinking pact , we look each other in the eye and say , it 's the killing of human beings we deplore , we do n't have any other considerations , no matter who does it or why. - - Is n't that so ? - - Is n't it the conventional wisdom of whites ? And what 's that to us ? Blacks do n't believe it . When I heard that APLA man on the radio saying there 's outrage only because this time whites were killed , I agreed with him . He shocked people because they see him as racist , but what he said is more than fact , Zeph , it 's true , it 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV and radio stations . But we ca n't say it because we 're not racist , we ca n't say it because we have to demonstrate we do n't stereotype , we do n't use racial categories in the worth of human life . Killings are killings . Death is death . Blood and wine mix . All we can produce is this cover-up. - - People do n't believe what they 're saying. ? Her proposition put before her . ? The people I know . And the people you know , blacks ? - - There are some who believe. - - How can they ! They know Odendaal wanted to kill them . What were their lives , to him. - - This thing  --  what you call it , conventional wisdom , it 's a kind of law , is n't it  --  what 's right , what 's wrong , that everyone really knows . If we find the people who speak it do n't mean what they 're saying , the law 's empty , there 's only one thing left. ? He stopped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law into our own hands . Her mouth changed in bewilderment .  | ? Because we mean it : killing is killing , every life is one of ours . So we have to become a law unto ourselves . She was moved , and blurted with awkward flippancy ? Well why not , there are many who have done so for other reasons . He had come to the city because there was to be a further meeting with a provincial official over application to have the land purchased from Odendaal declared a site-and-service settlement for the people known as the Odensville squatters . The Chief was expected to accompany Vera and Zeph Rapulana to Pretoria ; apparently he had stayed over the weekend with friends not known to Rapulana , since their arrival in the city together . As Vera and Zeph walked into the Foundation 's lobby , he entered with an attendant a few steps behind him . He was the son of the first of his father 's wives , a young man who held his head tilted back so that he looked down with half-closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Vera shook it , was the coldly damp one of someone who has had a drinking night . Zeph Rapulana in all his mature dignity placed his palms together , bowed with knees stiff , and pronounced a formal greeting in the terms of traditional obeisance . Yet both knew the Chief would be saying to the official only what Rapulana had coached him to say , only what Rapulana and Mrs Stark of the Legal Foundation had decided upon . Rapulana had said as if to himself ? His interests are elsewhere . He wanted to come to Johannesburg and learn to play in a band , but his late father would n't allow it . . . Perhaps he was wrong . Vera stood by , as an unbeliever before any ritual . Zeph was his own man with masters and slaves , yet he knew how to dissemble ; but whether it was to the Chief or whether to show that he himself , his own man , was definitively a black man , her observation of him did not easily reveal . At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her sense of connection with this man was that she had something to learn from him , as all unbelievers secretly hope to appropriate a value without adopting a faith . Their daughter is back sleeping , breathing in the house as she did when she was a child . Ben turns off the light above the bed where he and her mother lie . ? I still hope she 'll fall in love one day. - - She is in love . We ca n't talk now . He did n't have a name any more . They spoke of him as the old man ; he had had a second stroke and lost the power of speech . He was incontinent and Vera had the impression that the whole house smelled like the primates ' cage at a zoo , although Than-deka 's care was supplemented by a trained nurse brought in on night duty . Ben saw Vera 's nostrils pinching and felt anxious for her  --  this was his father , after all . It was as if he himself were in danger of becoming repulsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the old man in a private hospital where he 'd be well cared for . It was Annick who objected . ? He 's quite adequately cared for here , there 's nothing more to be done : it 's a massive stroke. - - So it does n't make any difference where he is , Annie . And this house really is n't geared to hold nurses and all the paraphernalia  --  it 's just distressing for everyone to no purpose . But Annick was a doctor , she did not need to remind her p 155 father . She had taken over from him the necessary contact with the old man 's doctor , since colleagues can be more open with one another , even if they may be mistaken in their perceptions , as the doctor was when he told Annie he did not want to cause pain to her father by telling him that this stroke was terminal and the sooner life ended the better . ? It does make every difference . He may not be able to move or speak to you , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knows he 's at home. - - Hardly that . He had to give up his own place , as you know . He 's been with us only a few months . Annick opened her clear-lipped mouth and touched the tip of her tongue to her teeth , his mannerism inherited along with his beauty ; so often , in her presence , it seemed that nature was mocking him in his own image , a reluctant Narcissus . She spoke gently . ? Home where you are , Dad . She came out to the stoep-study and hitched her hip onto the table where Vera was doing some weekend work for the Foundation . ? Would it be better for you if Lou and I cut short our stay . Do n't be worried about saying so. - - My god Annie , no . It 's better for us that you 're here. - - But we 're occupying the second bathroom . . . - - It does n't matter . You know how to see that the nurse and Thandeka are doing what they ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . She 's damn good , at our place she does it all , I do n't have to boil an egg. - - Is that a fair division of labour  --  you both work. ? Vera did not lift her head from her papers . I ler daughter 's gaze drifted relaxedly out of the window for a moment , where the sheen of a hadeda 's back took on peacock colours as it dug its beak-probe into the grass . ? What about p 15 6 you and Ben ? I remember when we were kids , he did most of the fetching and carrying to school and so on. ? She smiled , for admittance . ? Has n't he always indulged you  --  quite in awe of your career , you 're his priority , and yours ... well you 've always been available to so many other people . Is there ever a really fair division of labour , as you call it , between couples ? The sense of approaching some move that would change what they were , what they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl child was born in the image of Bennet , grew between them , a supersonic hum only they could hear . Instinctively  --  the Foundation papers were under her hand  --  Vera took on the impersonal openness of her professional manner : Mrs Stark spoke . ? Ben ca n't believe you are a couple . He refuses to see it. - - You mean , accept it ? - - But also to see . He does n't interpret what he sees . Annie wriggled her way more comfortably onto the table , pushing papers aside . ? What does he think he sees. - - Well , when I told him you were sleeping in one bed , that it 's your choice , he took it as a sign of some sort of immaturity . He said why not a teddy-bear . Annie laughed . Clients often laughed when they were about to defend themselves from some real or imagined accusation . ? But you have gay friends , you and Dad , there were gays at the party . Some of your Foundation people. - - Men . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was matchmaking with Lazar , he saw that Lazar was attracted to you  --  you are beautiful you know , men could be mistaken into thinking . . . ca n't blame them Vera had emerged , looking fully at her daughter , and the girl was amazed to see her eyes trembling with tears . To help p 157 her , Annie was casual . ? Poor Lazar , my guess is he 's a bee that bumbles into any flower . Anyway , he did n't object to us both going walking with him . I suppose he 'd invite a girl to bring her mother along if he thought that would help his pursuit. - - Perhaps he saw , but he thought it worth taking a chance that there could be a man who 'd convert you to men . It 's surely natural , if you 're a man. - - Their arrogance. - - Not really . Maybe there 's a chance , always. - - That 's Ben , not you ! That 's what Ben really believes , does n't he ? You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to my room occasionally . Somewhere in the house lies an old man who has lost the power : here , it 's time to talk . Vera overcomes the urge to touch her daughter , place a hand on her cheek , trace her features . It 's as if over thirty years she has missed the times to do so , she has always been looking elsewhere , turned away , while the girl grew and changed and moved into another self . ? That 's why I do n't understand . My darling , how can you do without a man ? A plea , a cry . ? Oh perfectly well , Ma ! I can look after myself ! - - I do n't mean that . Anyway , I do n't think you do , you have someone who looks after you , does n't she ? Husband , wife , whatever she is . You 've just said there 's never a fair division of labour. - - All right . Granted . Of course you ca n't know of the other dependencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it does between your kind of couple . Vera was hearing her out with the gathering silence of a - Ietermination to speak , against reluctance to reveal oneself . I mean the Iove -- naking. ? p 158 ? The love-making ! ? The amused , coaxing tone ; her mother might have been an adolescent timidly seeking infor-mation . ? I have to tell you , Annie , I ca n't understand how you can prefer it without a man. ? Vera got up and went to close the glass doors that led into the house . In privacy she turned passionately . ? Without a man ! - - It 's wonderful . Let me tell you . A woman is like you , she knows what you feel , what makes you feel , and so  --  she does  --  instinctively she does what you want , she 's feeling what you 're feeling , at the same time . It 's not like that with a man , who wants his kind of stimulation while you want yours . Oh I suppose you 've never made love with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted to one . Though you know , you 've seen , I 'm affectionate with a few women friends -- But it 's men you like . Always men ? There was an edge of judgment , the twinge of an old injury in the smile . ? I suppose you 've had a few more lovers I do n't know about . You 've experienced nothing but men , men. - - Yes . I love men . I mean exactly what I 'm saying : how can there be love-making without the penis . I do n't care what subtleties of feeling you achieve with all those caresses  --  and when you caress the other partner you 're really caressing yourself , are n't you , because you 're producing in her , you say , exactly what you yourself experience  --  after all that , you end up without that marvellous entry , that astonishing phenomenon of a man 's body that transforms itself and that you can take in . You ca n't tell me there 's anything like it ! There 's nothing like it , no closeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you may produce them just as well , you 'll say , between two women . But with the penis inside you , it 's not just the pleasure  --  it 's the being no p 159 longer alone . You exchange the burdens of self . You 're another creature . Annie was fascinated by and yet moved to retreat from her mother . ? The beast with two backs . Vera looked at her with a flash of anguish . ? Annie , what did I do to put you off men ? - - What makes you always think what I am is determined by you ! It 's against all your principles vis-ii-vis other people , is n't it . It was not only the door that closed them off from the house and its familiars , their separate existences . They had moved into a territory that might never be re-entered , never found again . As voices that come out of the mouth of a medium , they spoke with the dreamy groping of the subconscious , silences aloud between them . Coming into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bath at One-Twenty-One taken to disguise the roused flush of love-making  --  startled , because she was so far out of mind , to see the schoolgirl at the table with a mug of cocoa , doing her homework : ? Did I disgust you ? - - No no . I was sorry for you , I do n't know why . I wanted to comfort you . Seeing you come home , fucked out . I thought you 'd come to the age when you 'd need peace instead of what you were doing . What age ! At seventeen anyone over forty seemed old to me. ? The sense of a conspiracy unacknowledged in the past ; neither brought up the name of Ben . ? Tell me . We disgust you  --  Lou and I. -- Of course you don't. - - No of course ' about it . Tell me. - - Not disgust -- 'So long as I ' -n happy ' , mnh ? ? what all the parents deprived of grandchildren swallow bravely and say. ?  | ? No  --  I do n't disapprove , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the penis . I have to say it . I regret for you  --  no penis . Annie gave the smile that acknowledged : you mean well , and they both laughed . ? What about Ivan ? With the penis , and the grandchild , it still did n't work out. - - Ah , it does n't solve everything , I 'll admit -- But it 's the essential. - - For me , yes. - - So you see ? Someone was rattling at the glass door , the eager black face of Thandeka was distorted through it . Annie thrust in quickly , their eyes already on the door : ? You really have the same view as Dad , for him that thing 's also the essential , because he has it , he ca n't bear to think of any woman rejecting what 's gained for him the treasure of his life , you , you ? Thandeka burst out onto the stoep , her face the standard-bearer of the old man 's presence back in the house , and the lifeline between Annie and Vera fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was only that Vera was wanted on the telephone . Thandeka , so close to the drama of death , seemed to transfer a disproportionate sense of events to everything , even a telephone call . Sally Maqoma : she stuttered interruptions through Vera 's expressions of pleasure at hearing from her again after many weeks and cut short the exchange of circling civilities by which friends excuse neglect of one another . She had something to speak to Vera about , it could not be discussed over the phone . Vera felt the valves of her heart exposed , her blood vessels lying open from the time and place with Annie from which she had just emerged . Sally 's voice came as a disembodied assault loud in her ear . She recoiled , distrait . She explained that her father-  | in-law had had another stroke , nurses in the house , confusion ? could whatever it was possibly wait a day or two ? Without a man . Bereft . To imagine that state . Why , if Renoir could say he painted with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I live by my vagina ? Love affairs as a neat motif , a sprig recurring woven in the textile of her life  --  it 's been nothing like that . She is the one who , she understands , sent her soldier husband a photograph ringed in revenge  --  that was it ; she has never forgotten or forgiven him premature ejaculation . That 's the fact of it . The only time he did n't end up by himself like an excited little boy was after they had parted for divorce . A lover only in name ; a father who has never known he is one . Was n't that the real reason for abandoning him , never mind all the others more acceptable she gave to all around her : his conservatism , his love of sport that she did n't share , the mistake , for which neither was to blame , of wartime marriages between people too young to commit them-selves . Was n't that the real reason for the passion for Bennet ; not his remarkable beauty nor his attraction as an artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mountain holiday to sustain what the other had failed at , to stay within her and exchange the burden of self . Make the beast with two backs . The emblem under which her Hitler Baby remains with her is that of the first image that drew her attention to his flesh . As lie sat in her office one of his gestures brushed against a wire letter basket and loosened a scab from a scratch ; he ignored it  | while she was aware of a trickle of blood below his rolled-up sleeve tracing a hieroglyph down his forearm  --  a warm message to her . Spending on silk shirts and gold weights while the schoolgirl is kept short of clothes and once from a school camp wrote a pleading note because she had n't had money to buy toothpaste and was ashamed to keep using other girls ' ; she must understand her parents are not rich , she must not be indulged . And then to come home fucked out . The shower in One-Twenty-One , the dousing with perfume , the careful rearrangement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caress his breast with it ) ? nothing could disguise sexuality . A sign of life . Without knowing it , she had ringed herself just as she once ringed a photograph . Mrs Stark at her desk was working on the Foundation 's yearly report and clerks and colleagues came in and out with documents she requested or advice she sought . The tension between tenant-labourers and white farmers had come into prominence alongside that of the old squatter removals and their consequences . The Foundation had had successes in overturning eviction notices farmers served on tenant-labourers for fear these might make a claim to their share-crop holdings under a future majority government , but already in one case success ended in tragedy . Philemon Maseko  --  in this very office he had spoken through an interpreter  --  was shot dead by a group of white farmers a few days after his case was won . There were no arrests , no names of the farmers published ; the Foundation was to prosecute on behalf of the man 's family . Whether it was a general disturbance , with doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that produced a distracted mood among p 163 Foundation people , or whether this was something she projected from herself , it was present . Even Oupa seemed inattentive and distant . There was agreement among senior colleagues that they ought to publish some sort of crisis ' paper in addition to the report , urging that a drastic revision of property and land laws was necessary to forestall disaster in the growing conflict between white and black over access to land . She worked at night , at home , on a draft . Annie 's Lou shopped and did the cooking . lien entertained his daughter become a guest , and her friend , taking them to the cinema or one of the so-called clubs where t hey could hear black groups play the kind of music they enjoyed . The night nurse creaked heavily up and down the passage to make herself tea . No arsenal of repressive laws , no army , no police force can stabilize the situation  --  catch herself out in the jargon officialdom timed to abstract and distract , draw the shroud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal paper in his dead hand . No laws , no army , no police force can protect white farmers from the need and right of people desperate to find a place to lire . She wrote and rewrote . Who will read what is happening on the farm Rietvlei , Mooiplaas , Soetfontein , Barendsdrift , at Odensville ? The newspapers paraphrase a paragraph or two , wen those who read the original will be those who do not know , have never seen Odensville or lived , neither as farmer Nor tenant-labourer paid once a year when he harvests his crops , mm t Ile pretty farm ' , at the sweet fountain ' or the river-crossing Barend claimed for himself . Who , understanding by land reform ' the loss of his weekend fishing retreat , you chaps wo n't be invited down any longer , will be interested to hear that without Worm tenant-labourers are losing the mealies and millet they bane worked the land for , every day , for generations ? How far from lane another . The commissions in session , the politicians  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its interstices and the great principles of justice beyond it : these stand somewhere between . Through the will to formulate the Foundation 's understanding of the meaning of land , her own life was gathered in . She had no thought , no space in herself for anything else . When she stood up a moment to place her hands at the small of her back and arch it , face upturned to the ceiling , to ease tension , with the slight dizzy lurch there came the presence of Annick , Annie , about the house , although the girl might be out at that particular hour : the fact of her . You 've always been available to so many other people . The seventeen-year-old schoolgirl alone in the kitchen over those textbooks she used to cover with fancy paper and stickers of film stars . She looks up from the conventional wisdom of adults she 's been taught , parents love one another , that 's the goal of sex children are taught , for parents their children come before everything and all others  --  her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fucked out . How can that schoolgirl he expected to know the family never was the way she 's been told families are , to accept that her own father was another man ' . her mother 's sexuality something that made a claim above the love of children ? There came to Vera , as what had been a long time waiting to be admitted : it was because of her that Ben 's daughter was a lesbian . During the night she went into the room where he was dying . The black nurse was dozing in a chair , her uniform ridden tip her thick thighs . Her stockings were stretched so tight over the flesh that they shone , catching the light silvery from the shaded lamp . p 165 She looked at her father-in-law . His hand lay palm up outside the covers . She looked a long time . She knelt at the side of the bed and said close to his poor flabby ear , with prurient curiosity : What 's it like ? He could n't hear ; or he heard only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought  --  imagined ? ? as if he were somewhere shaking it . The side of his mouth twisted . It as the way a baby 's did when it was too young to smile  --  could mistaken for a smile . The Egyptians took with them furniture , jewellery , food , a wine and oil , and attendants who must finish their lives in the next world . Even his false teeth had been taken from him . His % , . itch , his time run out , had been handed to Ben for safekeeping . Ills attendant , as usual for whites in this country , was a black woman , caring for the failing functions of the body without shaming him . This black face crumpled with weariness , a deep division of effort frowning between the eyes , as if in perpetual anxiety catch the crammed minibus that brought her back and forth from Moletsane or Chiawelo or Zondi to be with him on the last threshold . There was no one else . When the nurse saw he had crossed she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cardigan and tube of lip salve , collect her pay and maybe a gift of oranges from a box nmglrt thriftily in bulk by Lou , and leave .  | Vera was sorting the clothes to give to charity , taking the opportunity of one of the public holidays renamed like the streets under successive regimes to reflect shifts in the ethos of power : Dingane 's Day , his victors oddly conceding the force of the black warrior-king 's name , changed to Day of the Covenant , commemorating his defeat by the Boers ' hard bargain with God , and become for the present something presumed semantically less offensive to blacks sold out by God : Day of the Vow . It was the first time she had handled a dead person 's clothes ; life shed like a skin . Different garments marked the ambivalence of the species to which the old man could be ascribed . Why two dress suits and a white dinner jacket as well , whereas the shirts were so worn they were not worth giving away , and there seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with satin revers was folded in tissue paper in its presentation box , apparently never worn , and of a style ( she shook it wit ) that suggested it must have been very costly , even in the Thirties in which it must have originated . The awareness of a survivor that one knows so little about the other and there will lw no  | opportunity to know more , is usual ; an accompaniment to death . Only speculation on the evidence of relics : one of the few known personae with which the old man could be identified was as an Englishman among expatriates of various roving nationalities in corporate outposts and Belgian colonial clubs in the Congo . There ( Bennet had picked up only the barest outline of his own origin , with which to fascinate her in the mountains ) the liaison with the half-Spanish half-Lebanese wife of a dealer in wild animal skins had led to his marriage to his mistress 's daughter . The dressing-gown had no place in the category of charity clothing for refugees or drought victims . But Ben would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . She was just thinking that the one person she could imagine it on , to his pleasure , was young Oupa , she would take it to the Foundation and offer the gift in such a way that it would not be a hand-me-down  --  when the phone rang . There was Oupa 's voice . ? Telepathy ! You were in my mind Agitation made him hoarse . ? Mrs Stark , please come over . To the flat . A call from Oupa on a public holiday ? If he had been in her mind putting a living form into the dressing-gown that , for souse reason , the old man had never brought to life , his immediate self had been placed by her , far removed , in however a voting man like him would be spending a day at leisure . What on earth  --  an accident , a mugging , police raid , eviction  --  all the ordinary hazards that surrounded his life  --  she thought instantly of what it would be necessary to bring : money and a demeanour to pull rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come. -  - -  Mrs Maqoma ? But what is all this about ? Why Mrs Maqoma ? ?  | She heard he was being interrupted by voices in the background . His hand must have cupped the receiver and lifted again . ? Please , Mrs Stark , come. - - Oupa , who 's crying there , tell me what 's happening ? But the call was cut off ; she had the impression someone had taken the receiver from him and replaced it . In the living-room Ben was listening to his favourite Shostakovich piano concerto while reading . She stood about a moment ; under her own sense of alarm was the serenity he had regained for himself , alone with her , now that his father and daughter were no longer in the house . ? There 's just been such a peculiar call from Oupa . He looked up over his glasses . ? On a holiday ? What 's he want. - - God knows . He said Sally says I must come to the flat ? ( she corrected ) ? his flat . Sally. - - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? ? All she did know was that she had forgotten her promise to call Sally back when she telephoned just before the old man died . ? D' you want me to go with you . . . what 's that you 've got ? The glasses slipped , his strange deep eyes rested on the dressing-gown lying over her arm ; the eyes belonging along with the garment to some unexplained aspect of the old man 's being , perhaps even belonging together ? ? the mistress 's gift to her lover , and the son her daughter had borne him  --  in the double liaison out of which Bennet emerged . ? No . . . no , I 'd better do as they asked . Oupa belonged to her Foundation responsibilities , Ben had no obligation to get up from his chair , his hooks , his music . She lifted her arm : ? Grandpops 's finery. ? Annick 's childish name for the old man .  | ? When would he ever wear it. - - Of course not . Someone must 've given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury . The son put out his sallow hand , as he could do now that her house was theirs alone again , to touch hers as she left , spoke drily . ? Some woman. ?  | Oupa must have been hanging about at the door waiting to open it to her . There he was . His curly-lashed eyes were lowered sulkily as if to ward off reproach and his tongue comforted dry lips before he spoke . ? Sorry . It 's her mother made me call you here. - - And what is this all about ? ? But they were already entering the room where her voice invaded a silence so charged she might have been shouting . She had the sudden impulse of distaste  --  premonition  --  to turn and leave : what am I doing here ? What were they all doing here ? Sally sat upright , thrust forward on the single armchair ; Didy stood with his back to the television set against images without sound ; and on the floor , shockingly , face hidden on her knees and arms shielding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Oupa a step behind her : all might have been thrust by a stage director  --  you here , you there . Each waited for someone to speak . Only Didy flicked a blink of greeting at Vera 's presence . Sally 's face was that of a stranger confronting Vera , broad with hostility and accusation . ? Ask your favourite , ask the man you introduced her to , the one she met in your house , the one  | you liked so much that we let her go around with him and his friends . Ask him . Didy dropped back his head and expelled a breath of distressed embarrassment . He made some sort of appeal to her in her own language . ? No , let Vera ask him ! - - I do n't know why you have to drag Vera into it. - - Well if there 's trouble ... among friends . . . we 're all in it. ? Vera lied against the impulse to back out . ? You knew he was married , you know she 's a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd would be nice company for her , safe ?

What 's happened with you and the girl ? - - He 's been sleeping with my child , my daughter . I take her to a doctor and I find she 's pregnant . That 's what 's happened . That 's the result of the nice people you introduced her to ! Not a word from you , Vera , not a word of warning , you must have known she was running around with him --  I ? I knew nothing , I had no idea . I do n't have anything to do with the private lives of the people at the Foundation --  Oh yes you do . You had him in your house . You said n othing to me when she went to parties and they were not parties , he was bringing her back to this place to sleep with her ! You had him and the other nice friends in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wail , twisting her feet one upon the other . everybody looked at her , nobody touched her . Vera did not turn to Oupa , who slunk out to fetch a kitchen chair for her , a gesture Sally read with a despising glance as a cull ' won his employer-friend 's support . p 172 And did the companionable lunches in her office count for nothing ? The years of deprivation on Robben Island , did they not make understandable a weakness for the pleasures of affection and love-making , the temptation of an enticing girl ? But a schoolgirl . Sally and Didy 's daughter . He placed the chair . ? Oupa , you idiot. ? The moment the aside came from her she realized it would be taken by Sally as a dismissing insult to her . And to say to him , is this true , would be worse : doubting Sally . She looked at the bowed head of Mpho , the dreadlocks falling either side of her pretty ears dangling ear-rings large as they were . Likely that this girl had made love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one named as culpable , unable to prove he was n't . This lovely child  --  she saw now what should have been evident while the girl lived in her house -- -had all the instincts of her sex Annick never had had . She wanted to put out a hand and stroke her head , but there was in Sally a forbidding authority against anyone making such a move . Vera addressed Didy as if he stood once again in the persona she had not recognized at her door . ? How was I to know ? Do you think I would n't have done something , I would have spoken to him ... ? Sally wrested the attention away . ? But you should have told us your nice young man was married , his wife was n't here , he was running around like any man . . . and look at him , ten years older than a schoolgirl , and no respect for her or her parents . Parties ! She lied to us . When a girl-friend came to call for her , it was him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know he was waiting in this place . Vera knew it was pointless to question Oupa but could not ignore that this was expected of her . Their gaze nret apart front the others , he was cornered by her , counting upon her . How  | did you let it begin. ? He understood this signalled You knew I trusted you , there are plenty of other women for you . ? It was nothing , quite okay , we all went to Kippies together to hear the music , poetry readings , and that . And then one time She said she wanted to see a play , she used to go to plays in London and  --  I even asked you , you remember . . . what was a good one . . . and she said her parents must n't know she would go out alone , she was only allowed if there were other girls , she 'd tell them she was going to a party . So after that , we saw each other. - - And the wife ? ? Sally rang out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes my child , under age  --  does he know that ? ? a criminal offence  --  he gets my child pregnant ? He 'll go to jail , does he know that ! - - Your child is not under age , do n't talk like that Sibo . Sixteen is not under age . She 's an adult by law . And what 's the Ilse of threatening ? You want him to divorce his wife ? You want 11 pho to get married at sixteen , not yet passed her A levels ? Is that how we want to see her end up before her life 's begun . Is that what you want ? Of course you do n't . Then what 's the use of all this , blaming this one , blaming that. - - We should never have brought her from London . She should have been left at school there . You wanted her home ; ' home ' here , to get pregnant at school like every girl from a location. - - All right . You also wanted her here . Blaming again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count on these people. ? Sally spoke of Vera as if Vera were not summoned by her to be present . Same as it always was , eager to help so 's to be on the right aide with us . And making a mess of it . Bringing us harm . Sihongile , stop it ! You 're talking nonsense , you do n't  | know what you 're saying . It 's my fault , it 's Vera 's fault  --  what 's the use , what we need is to talk about what we 're going to do , have you forgotten about Mpho , she 's sitting there on the floor , she 's our daughter -- I do n't know what we 're going to do about her . I only know she 's got herself into a mess. - - What we 're going to do has nothing to do with this young man . We should n't be in this place of his at all . He 's out of it now , the whole matter .

Mpho , get up , come on , you 're not alone Usually so quick and graceful , the girl lumbered to her feet , her tear-bloated face had the withdrawn expressionlessness Vera was familiar with in accused brought before court without hope of being found not guilty . Still the wrong thing : making her stand there . Perhaps she was in love with Oupa ; but she knew , young and inexperienced in the judgments of the world as she was , that this was no plea . ? You mean Mpho should have an abortion . Didymus was used to doing what had to be done . ? Yes . And we 're new here , now . It must be without danger to her . You 're the one who 'll be able to make sure of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl went over to the arm of the chair where her mother was sitting and picked up a duffle bag decorated with the iconographic names of pop groups . She ignored her mother and took out a handkerchief , blew her nose . FUNK DOGS HIPHOP ROCK ELECTRIC PETALS INSTANT KARMA  | An intense discomfiture filled the room as if the temperature were rising . The girl was disposed of like a body . She was a body , in the solution that had been found ; nothing else . The other aspects of the situation that had brought them together had been withdrawn  --  emotions , motives and responsibilities nobody knew how to deal with . Didymus gathered his wife and ( laughter ; the girl walked out before him without glancing at anyone except  --  a moment  --  up at Oupa ; Vera saw the movement of the head , from behind , and could not tell whether the look was in compact or defiance ; but she saw no responding change in Oupa 's face .

Do n't treat her as if she 's a criminal , put your arms round her , hug her , she 's your daughter ? but the girl , walking alone before her parents , was gone down the corridor . Vera slowed to keep to the hesitant pace of Oupa accompanying her , urgent to speak . ? I was n't the first one she 'd been with. - - Oh what does that matter . Why tell me . It 's not the point. ? Vera was impatient with him for burdening her with the confusion of excuses , if they could be accepted as such , she lead thought of already . ? Not to you . But it would matter to her parents . I did n't want to make more trouble for Mpho , if I 'd told them . They walked a few steps . ? So you love her . You think you were in love with her. - -I do n't know . How can I be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed away from the intrusion . ? You mean you do n't think you have the right to. ? She smiled . ? That does n't prevent it coming about , you know. ? When I say I do n't know . . . she 's such a kid , the time  | when l might have a girl-friend like that , I was inside , those young years . But also she 's seen , she knows , so many things I never have  --  London and Europe and so on ... sometimes she even laughs at me , the things I do n't know about . In one way she 's too young , and in another way she 's ahead of me . So 1 do n't suppose we could ever get it right . As she drove home she realized she had not once , while there in the flat , been aware that this was One-Twenty-One . Otto 's One-Twenty-One . With that unawareness , everything that place had been to her and her lover slipped out of grasp ; no retracing of walls and footsteps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , overlaid , it was disappeared for ever .

He revised what Sibongile had said : Just get rid of it . ? She 's still angry with me ? - - She has the idea you ought to sack the man. - - How could she possibly expect that ! Even if I had the power to , which I don't. - - Of course . It 's just that she 's in such a state . I can tell you . It 's not easy . After all , Mpho is our only daughter , we 'd given up hope of having a girl and then she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , you know 1 was away most of the time . And Mpho just shuts herself off , she wo n't speak to her mother , she wo n't even speak to me , though I do n't reproach p 177 her , I 'm prepared to forget about the whole business once it 's been dealt with . Didymus looked so different , so  --  battle-weary , in comparison with the man in great danger who had smiled and said , Vera how mean of you ; so isolated , in contrast to the man who lived in the solitude of disguise . She had the instinct to offer some sort of exchange of unexpected situations , as people who feel attachment for one another do ; something private out of her own life . You know Didy , Annie has become a lesbian . He glanced away , clucked his tongue bewilderedly . After a moment , an African exclamation : ? Yoh-yoh !

They 're around . Of course , it 'll be part of our constitution that there 'll be no discrimination against any sex . . . but that does n't cover about your own child becoming  --  d' you have any idea what made her ? - - At present just . . . I suppose we believe we 're responsible for what we think has gone wrong with our children and in their judgment has n't gone wrong at all. - - Sally and me , with Mpho. - - Maybe .

Man , I do n't know . But they would n't apply to Annie ? - - No . He saw that this was the limit of her confidences , for the time being ; his old Underground experience in being alert to moods when people reveal themselves remained sensitive to the dropping and raising of barriers . They discussed , as if the itinerary for a journey or the agenda for a meeting , the doctor Vera had managed to persuade ? playing on his left-wing sympathies and lack of open activity in liberation politics  --  to salve his conscience , do his bit by removing an embryo from the daughter of an eminent couple who had suffered for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place were set . Vera walked with Didymus , once again , to his car , this time there openly outside the gate . She hesitated at the window after he was seated . ? Ben refuses to believe it  --  about Annie . He pretends not to know. ?  | The radio alarm clock Mpho had not been able to reMist , duty-free , as she left London airport , woke her with its Japanese version of Greensleeves at the hour she had set . She lay with her fists at her mouth , feeling on them the soft double stream of breath from her nostrils . To awake in the very early morning when everyone else is unconscious is to be alone in the world . She got up and went to the window , carefully pulled the curtain . All was blurred with mist and , set back on a hill , only t he glass facade of a towering building glistened out of it , mirror to the still hidden sun . She took off the Mickey Mouse T-shirt mite slept in , her breasts dragged up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then picked it up again , rolled it and 1 , tit it in her duffle bag . Naked , she packed some other clothes atttl a.goggle-eyed toy cat . She went to the window to see one more time the radiant face witnessing her . As she pulled in her atoutat h muscles to zip up her jeans a sense of fear and wonder and disbelief at what was there , inside , held her dead still . A p 180 hunt ) of panic was suppressed with a swallow of saliva . She put herself together as she always was : frilled elasticized hand circling her dreadlocks like an open blue rose on the crown of her head , another T-shirt with some other legend or logo on it , bright socks rolled round the ankles , black sneakers , the crook 'd wires of one of her collection of earrings hooked through the soft brown tips of her ear-lobes . Mpho . That 's Mpho . The mirror on her dressing-table caught her as the sun did the face of the building ; there she is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something overturned : she felt gaily released for a moment ; nothing had ever happened , she had just got off the plane from London to meet the admiring glances of this country called home . Nobody heard , nobody saw her close the front door behind her . In this white part of the suburban city only joggers were about , hamsters working their daily treadmill . She took an empty bus to a city terminal where blacks arrive from the townships to go to work . Street children lay in doorways as drifts of cartons , paper and banana skins lay in gutters . Women were setting out rows of boiled mealies , the venders of watches , sunglasses , vaseline , baseball caps , baby clothes , were unpacking their stock . A shebeen on a packing-case displayed litre bottles of beer and half-jacks of brandy , and before this altar a man still crazed from the drinking of the night danced round her to mbaqanga music coming from the stall-holder 's cassette player . The freshness of the morning brought the smell of urine as dew intensifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an untouchable insolent authority beauty creates , going against the stream of workers , agile among the combis cornering , stopping and starting racing-circuit-style , smiling in response to remarks made to her p 181 in the language no one who made them would believe she did n't understand . There is dread at the sight of an empty bed . Gone . Gone , it says . Where ? The contractions of fear ; people kill themselves if they have been made to feel ashamed of their lives . From that comes the extreme of fear : what should have been done to avert the sight of the bed , there , empty . What has been done to bring it about . Sibongile knows  --  he does n't have to say it , does n't have to conceal  --  Didymus thinks she has been too harsh and judgmental towards the girl . An appallingly reasonable conviction strikes her ; of course . She 's gone to that man . He bunched his mouth . ? Unlikely . He 'd be scared . I think hr 's a weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think he 'd take her in , now . Sibongile rummaged again for some clue  --  no note , of course , if the idea is to punish your parents you certainly do n't leave a note . Didymus followed her into the room , a place mute and accusatory . The odour of Mpho was there , the mingle of perfume and deodorants and skin-warmed clothing , sweaty sneakers , the mint-flavoured gum she liked . She could have run away to people they did n't know she knew , people picked up at those places young people frequent , Kippies , discos . Now something really terrible could be happening to her , rape , drugs . They stood about in her absence . Why do you think she 's done this ? ? p 182 ? Scared . She 's scared of what 's going to happen to her . The operation. - - For heaven 's sake . It 's hardly an operation . I 've told her , she 'll be asleep , she wo n't feel anything . I even told her I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his face . ? Why d' you do that . But Sibongile  --  Sally  --  belonged to the generation and the experience that saw emancipation in hardening their half-adult children with the intimate life of their parents . ? Why not ? So she would n't be scared. - - But if you put yourself in the same boat  --  why should she feel there 's anything wrong with her adventure with the man , why that whole business in the flat , her having to hide her face from us . . . you get pregnant , you have an abortion , does n't matter , it 's nothing to worry about. - - Oh you make me mad . Is n't what 's happened enough without you . . . d' you think she should n't be allowed to know what our life was like sometimes in exile , how hard up we were , could n't even keep the boys with us , how could we have another child those days in East Germany ! You always want to protect her from everything , and then look what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through has anything to do with her playing around with someone else 's man and getting herself pregnant ! He spread and then dropped his hands : not prepared to argue . ? I 'm going to his flat to see if he knows where she is . Sibongile was due to take part in a press conference  --  it would be that very morning the child chose to run away , God knows where . She was dressed for public exposure . In her distraction and anxiety she had put on as a general does his uniform her tailored skirt and jacket , her accoutrements of small gold p 183 ear-rings ( nothing showy ) , her carved wooden bracelets  --  as royalty is expected to wear garments and jewellery designed and made in their own country , a walking billboard for home products , she always saw to it that she included on her person some example of African craft . It 's understood  --  and she exacted this from her co-workers  --  that personal obligations must be subordinate to the cause , always had been in exile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and negotiation tables . Public exposure may be an armour within which trembling flesh is hidden . Photo opportunities ( that 's what the press asks for ) are the victim 's obligation to wear a persona separated by duty from self . It simply was not possible , for Sibongile ; not possible , if she was what she had taken responsibility to be in the Movement , for her to telephone and leave a message that her chair would be vacant  --  because ? Because a foolish child had got herself into a mess and punished her mother by leaving a deserted bed . When she was ill and alone , in London , with a baby to care for , could she expect to call her husband back from wherever they might have sent him , another country , another continent ? She stood there , looking at Didymus , unable to leave . All the partings and reappearances , the arrivals and departures , f the climates and languages , the queueing for rubber-stamped entry and exit were present between them , as a wind gathers up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? Go on . I 'll call . I 'll leave a message for someone to slip to you .

So they inhabit it and destroy the very thing they believe they wanted . It becomes the ghetto we think we 've escaped . Only it costs much , much more .

Is n't this what our education for democracy ' is all about , after you 've learnt to make your cross on a bit of paper , after you 've learnt not to allow yourself to be bribed or intimidated to vote for someone you do n't trust to govern your life : it 's about not occupying the past , not moving into it , but remaking our habitation , our country , to let us live within the needs of space and decency our country can afford . And that 's what the whites have to learn , too . Luxury 's a debt they ca n't pay .

Bloody fucking bastard : suddenly he joined Sihongile in anger against Vera 's nice young man . But a watery dark p 185 outline had appeared on the other side of the glass door ; it opened and he was there , barefoot , in running shorts , a thick ' lice of bread with a bite out of it , in one hand ; at once showing In his face that he felt foolish caught like that . Didymus spoke Zulu  --  it was Sibongile 's , not his own lan-'age and he did n't know what this man 's was , but every black In Johannesburg at least understands Zulu , he needed a lingua franca other than English for this occasion .

There In Alex . Mpho . That 's Mpho . Their girl was ironing on the kitchen table in the Alexandra house where her father had come to live as an infant when his parents left the Transkei . So many countries , cities , rooms , hideouts , personae  --  and now his daughter was ironing sheets on that same table in that same kitchen , a doek tied over her fancy hair-style .

Sibongile 's elegance , the hound's-tooth tweed suit and knotted silk scarf , high-heeled patent shoes and sheen of matching navy blue stockings emphasizing her stance before all that was familiar to him and his mother within the four walls ; the old grey-painted dresser with its display of enamel plates , mugs on hooks , three-legged alarm clock ticking , the refrigerator with wadded newspaper under one lame leg , the enormous scoured aluminium pots on the stove , his childhood reassurance against hunger through many lean times , the calendars illustrated with pink blondes and fluffy puppies , the framed Last Supper and blurred certificates of children 's prowess , long ago , at bible class , Didymus Maqoma 's matric certificate  --  these powerful inanimates stood back from Sibongile 's presence . ? I think Mama knows what her granddaughter told her . We do n't have to go over it. ? Sibongile spoke a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xhosa , not to be seen wanting in respect . But English was the medium for Mpho , English was the reminder to her that there was no running away from what she was , what circumstance made of her , a girl who had to have lessons in order to claim a mother tongue . Once home , the new world had to be made of exile and home , both accepted . In the vocabulary Sibongile herself had absorbed unconsciously through the circumstance of exile in London she found this next escapade  --  Alexandra  --  what the English called tiresome  --  yes , plain tiresome , mixed with a concealed hysterical relief that the  | girl was alive and safe . ? Mpho , why did you have to go off in the middle of the night or whenever it was , not leave a note or anything . Nobody would have stopped you if you 'd said you wanted to spend the next few days with gogo . It was just silly , d a darling . At the end of the next few clays ' was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it was still silence : the girl did n't look up , was expertly folding the sheet in four , testing the iron with the hiss of a finger first moistened by her tongue , and then running the iron over the neat oblong .

I will look after the child here , in my house . I have told Mpho. ? She stood up , put aside the basin of potatoes . Didymus rose , too , from the plastic chair whose screws on metal tube legs he had been turning in patient forbearance . He rut over to Mpho and put his hand gently on her nape , the gesture of love familiar to both his women , wife and daughter . One day Mpho will have children she 'll care for herself . That 's the way it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Thank you , Mania , Sibongile and I , we thank you for looking after her so %ell ; we 'll come back to fetch her at the weekend . Careful that the movement should not be interpreted by him as a rejection of his hand on her neck , Mpho slowly looked up , untied the doek from her head , laid it on the table , and turned , ready , to her father .  | A lawyer and a clerical assistant , both of the Legal Foundation , were attacked this week while on an investigative tour of State-owned land the Government proposes to sell off to private ownership in advance of the installation of an interim government .

The old woman said  --  Didymus had told her  --  We are not white people . Didymus dismissed this *milling , in passing . But maybe Oupa would have liked to have is child , somewhere , souvenir of the beautiful girl who was not for him , out of his class , speaking and moving in the manner of cities he had never seen , yet at the same time a black girl , sharing the precious familiarity , the dangerous condition of being black , for ' which he had dredged seaweed and broken rocks on a prison island .

He was in and out with papers and messages and talk on Foundation matters continued between them as usual , but there were no lively asides loom hire , he kept his eyes on papers or unfocussed , to concen- p 190 Irate on what was being discussed ; only occasionally , from the door , as if he had forgotten something , in what was barely a pause : his smile . This  --  to her  --  self-punishing attitude became more and more unnecessary ; she found herself increasingly impatient with the idea that he should have to feel exaggeratedly contrite , to the extent that this was carried over to his demeanour at work .

Sly little miss lied to her parents , made friends collude with and cover up for her when she went to make love in that flat ; the love-nest of two generations . On the three-day drive around the country the atmosphere between Mrs Stark and Oupa was easier but still was created only by exchanges of reaction to what they saw and to whom they talked in relation to their task .

From his armchair the proprietor called out in Afrikaans Show mevrou and meneer to their rooms , Klaus , show where the bathroom is . They laughed together over this as they had not laughed since Oupa summoned her to the flat . The factotum dragged hark and forth serving a dinner of mutton , mealie rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taste for the dishes of their country others would find dull and unappetizing . In his high-collared white jacket moulded in sweat-dried contours like a plaster cast containing his body , listing on shoes cot out on the uppers to ease bunions , the old black man brought Oupa 's third can of beer . ? Did n't your baas see me when he told you to show the ' nearer his room , Baba ? In the black face darker-streaked with age the mouth gaped nn a thick pink tongue . He looked slyly , comically round the empty dining-room before answering in his language . Oupa , clasping the old man 's arm , laughed as he translated for her : I lie white man does n't want to see nothing . Nothing any more . Nothing nothing . In the quiet of an early-morning start in another part of the country , an empty road , hornbills taking off from cowpats they were pecking at as the Foundation station-wagon approached , Oupa spoke as if to himself ? This 's only about fifty kilometres from my uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The turn 's just over there at the trees . She was watching the approach of the stand of eucalyptus ;  | they neared ; she could see long swathes of swaddling bark peeling from their white trunks . ? Let 's take it . He turned his head to her . ? We go there ? - - Yes. ? Mrs Stark authorizing transgression of one of the strictly honoured rules of the Foundation : the Foundation 's vehicles are not to be used for private purposes . And Vera added  --  Why not . It makes no sense for you to be so close , and drive on . So that day when they should have been heading for the city and the office she offered him a joy-ride ; not in the usual sense , of aimless pleasure , but the joy of restoration , union , in some  --  tentative  --  compensation for the sundering that outcast him , in his sense of self , in what she knew of him in the city . He asked no questions . That he did n't was in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple confidence between them . He opened his window to let the morning air gush in wide , he slotted a Ladysmith Black Mambazo cassette into the player he drove faster ; it was as if he had downed a couple of the beer he enjoyed so much . ? You give me the green light , okay . I 'm going to stop at a store . Get some sweets and things. ? As they neared the settlement there were roadside venders selling mounds of sweet potatoes and onions and an Indian store into whose dimness he disappeared in skipping strides . He came out with chips and Jelly Babies , clear plastic guns filled with candy pills for the children , and packets of tea and sugar , the gift ' to poor people offer adults the way rich visitors offer flowers . If there had been somewhere for her to wait for him while he made his visit she would have suggested that he leave her there so that she would not intrude . She hung hack as two small children threw aside the cardboard box in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and leapt to fling themselves p 193 at him . The younger had him by the leg , the elder hung from his neck . Hampered with joy , he staggered through the gap of a fence that had been shored up with strands of barbed wire and off-cuts of tin roofing , and approached the small , sagging mud-brick house , as much part of the features of the country as anthills in the veld . One of the children broke loose and ran inside shouting . There was some exchange ; a woman came out , a plump young face screwed up , hand shielding her gaze . She greeted  --  her man ? her husband ? ? respectfully , distantly , in the manner of one expecting an explanation . In their language , he introduced Vera . Shaking hands , brought close to her : the tender roundness of the neck with the gleam of sweat-necklaces in its three circling lines . These shelters provided for by men absent in cities fill up with women ; in the all-purpose room were several and a baby or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove . The sweetish smell of something boiling  --  offal ? ? was swallowed with tea flurriedly made for the white visitor ; the children brought her their school exercise books . Perhaps they thought she was some kind of teacher or inspector . In her familiarity , through her work , with homes like this one , scatterings of habitation outcropped along with the trash-pits of white towns , she was accustomed to being regarded as someone to whom it was an opportunity to address a demand , attention . She and the children chattered and laughed although they had no common language , while she admired their drawings and painstaking calligraphy . Time passed  --  some idea the visitors were to wait for the eldest child to come home from school . But he did not appear , and his father was not surprised or perturbed . ? It 's far . And they play on the road , you know how kids are . Sometimes I myself , I used to he the whole afternoon , coming home , forgetting to come .. From the cajoling , laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother not to be angry with the child , but she jerked her head in rejection . Such movements of self-assertion surfaced from the withdrawn placidity with which she kept her place . Sitting at the kitchen table , she might be any of the other women murmuring there . Her man from the city talked and she responded only to questions , now and then giggled when others did , and covered her mouth with her hand . The sun shifted its angle through the window barred with strips of tin ; he decided , turning to his fellow visitor ? Time to get going , hei ? And while the farewells were being made to all the women , the children hung again about him . Their heads caressed under his hands storing up the shapes , he asked  --  undercover  --  whether his employer could help him out ? ? The loan of twenty rands or so . Only then did he and his wife have a few minutes alone together ; he put his palm on her waist to guide her to the only other room of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror , a crocheted bedspread was reflected . The door was not closed behind them but their voices were so low they could not be heard in the kitchen . Whether they embraced , whether they said to one another what could not be said in the company in which the visit had passed , no one could know . They were soon back . He hugged his children , he joked again with the women : a man , a lover , a husband , a father . His wife stood aside  --  displaced by an arrival without a letter , without warning in the life she held together by herself ; in her stance , the way her full neck rose , she alone , of all the other women , in possession of him ; lonely . That was how Vera saw her and did not know she would never forget her . Driving away . To say he was so happy : how to explain what this was . He might have expected to be sad . Depressed , at least , at taking up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about his children , boastful of their excitement at seeing him ,  | he was drinking deep of being loved . ? Man , I wish you could 've seen my big boy , last time , he was nearly as tall as I am  --  right up here to my ear . And he 's clever , there he 's already bigger than me , I 'm telling you . . . He can do everything . At Christmas , one of my other uncles was here at their place with his car , so this kid says , Ntatemoholo , I bet you I can drive , so his uncle gets in next to him and hands over the keys . And off ! That kid manages the clutch , gears , everything . Just learnt from watching people . To say he was happy : it 's to say he was whole . He 'd accepted himself again ; husband , father , Freedom Fighter , womanizer , and clerk at the Legal Foundation . At that moment when , glancing at his profile , she found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . A black man was waving a plastic container . A good mood overflows in openness to others ; the Foundation station-wagon slowed and pulled up level with a brother in trouble , run out of gas . He leaned from the window and spoke to the man in the language of the district . An arm thrust through and snatched the keys from the ignition . She heard the gurgle as the forearm struck against Oupa 's windpipe in passing and saw the mound of a ring with a red stone on a finger . Tswaya ! Get out ! A voice that of a man giving routine orders . All the muscles in Oupa 's body gathered in a storm of tension that sucked into a vacuum his shock and hers , she felt it draw at her as if he had had his hand upon her . He burst out of the door knocking the man back with its force . The scuffle and animal grunting and yells of two men fighting . She saw another man run from behind the decoy car with a gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's voice screaming screaming and ran screaming , another self , screaming , to where the two men fought on the ground . The keys were thrown ,
