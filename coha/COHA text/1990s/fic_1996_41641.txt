We were sipping grappa , watching The Tragic Stiletto of Trabzon on an old Zenith TV in a suburban public square outside of Patras . Though it was dusk , and the images were murky , the film looked familiar , like a dim photo resolving in its pan . My wife and I were trying to read the lips of the dubbed and now dead third-rate British movie stars from the forties . An exotic theft held our interest-an amulet pared directly off the heroine 's neck-while soldiers lined the rim of the square to defend the town against any drunk who might raise his fists in a distant recollection of Democratic Greece . It was 1972 , a few years before I 'd start my life over again , but I 'm getting ahead of myself , because it was the words , not even the movie , tragic stiletto , that brought back a hazy memory , a critic over my shoulder , chastising me for something shamefully asinine I 'd once said or done . I could n't remember for sure who 'd said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether I even wanted to remember or to forget . <p> My wife 's handbag , including her passport and traveler 's checks , was lifted off the back of her chair , that 's how distracted we were while locals made faces at us behind our backs : our American dollars were desirable , whereas in the flesh we were banal and expendable , or , as I remembered reading in the paper a few days earlier about a couple in a rented Renault , explodable . We had reason to be distracted . Earlier , we 'd missed the ferry to Brindisi . At least we thought we 'd missed it . Some clerk told us the last boat had departed an hour before . " This time of year we 're very busy , " he said , meaning in the heat of August , " and we sell out tickets fast . " So we bought our non-refundable tickets for the next morning , parked our car at the pier so we 'd be first in line , and sat , until an hour later we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shout at the swindler , he said , " Oh , I thought you meant our boat . The other has holes . Completely unsafe . " After that , everything else had to be our fault : if there is a country of Omens and Signs , it has to be Greece . <p> In the movie an anonymous dark-skinned swine took a dagger out of some elaborate draping that served as his belt , and , after taking the amulet , stabbed our blond heroine three times , presumably to further the plot so her lover could scour the city and avenge her loss . My wife , I was reasonably certain , had recently slept with someone else , and I kept the hurt close to me , like a cold medallion on my chest , all through Europe . So we sat silently before the screen , until eventually she decided it was stupid to sit in the open air listening to dialogue that sounded like ugly murmurs ( that 's what she thought of Greek ) while the smutty traffic drove back and forth through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lure pretty women in what they saw as their luxurious rusted-out ' 57 Fords . <p> I saw the movie twice . Once as a boy and once as a man . Once while my mother peeled carrots into a pot , cursing at the screen and crying , and once with my wife at my side shaking her head and rolling her eyes . " Did he say Boris or boring ? " <p> " What else would you like to do ? " I asked . <p> " Go to bed " she said , " so we can get an early start for Brindisi . I ca n't wait to get out of this fucking country . " <p> It was still hot , probably still over ninety degrees after six . I was wearing a white oxford shirt and khaki shorts , and they were both saturated with sweat . We had spent the morning on the beach , so our thighs and our shoulders in particular were almost crimson . My wife wore a brown sundress that seemed to have faded after a week in Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexposed skin ; her long brown hair , parted in the middle , was stringy wet . Being in the square , with its cloudy scent of smoked meat wafting out of every window , intensified the feeling of being skewered . My wife 's handbag had been one of those colorful hemp-knit shoulder purses they used to call Greek bags . But now this whole scene is growing too literal , reduced to discussion , so the light around it grows dim . The point is , I tore into her for what she wore around her neck . It looked like a birthmark , but the purple perforated oval had been made by lips and teeth , someone else 's , so I could n't bear to look at her . Besides , everyone else was looking . I was therefore extraneous . <p> My mother came from Russia , was stern in spite of herself ( and hardest on herself ) , and never lost the k-k-k sound to her consonants , and never lost the sea tide lilt to her sentences , so every family in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the height of the Cold War , I 'd heard rumors that she was supposed to have been a spy . A spy who had difficulty getting out of her nightgown until late afternoon . Which must be why the Ruskies lost the Cold War and now run around with cheap imitations of Levi 's , while they mope , jobless , on their street corners . At least that 's what we saw when we went to visit my mother 's homeland without her the week before we took the plane to Greece . " Take pictures of my old house , " she 'd said . Her old house , which was now in another country . Or had been taken down from there so all that remained were tire tracks from a Russian tank . <p> Every Zimmer and Motel we went to refused us a bed for the night , including a place called Zorba 's , which had been recommended in our guidebook as particularly friendly to Americans . So what did we do ? After we left the movie , we walked to the closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for a double sleeping bag , a small pup tent ( my wife thought it practical since in Italy we could camp along the coast ) , along with pots and pans and utensils . I even bought a Swiss Army knife , the knife all my friends had owned when I was a boy but my mother had prohibited because she thought it too dangerous . It had a scissors and a corkscrew and a fingernail clipper and a screwdriver . Even at twenty-eight , I thought it astonishing . We walked around for a while with the tent on my backpack , until we found a restaurant whose sign said " Kamping : ' Some of the locals were eating dinner there , and those who bothered to look up to sneer at us made us feel as if we had not been sufficiently humiliated at the movie . " Maybe we 're too old for camping , " she said . <p> " After what we just spent ? " I shrugged . " Look , it 's eight-thirty . You want to sleep in the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The owner was jovial , he called us Mr. and Mrs. America , he still loved Americans , he knew the difference between a country and a government , and then he lowered his voice to say again , " I know the difference between a government and a country , even if I ca n't say so in a normal human voice . So you come here , " he said , and took us to a square gravel of field about fifty yards behind the restaurant . " It 's off-season , " he said , " so you might have the place to yourself . If you need to use the bathroom , it 's right behind my place . " He pointed to what looked like a large outhouse behind the restaurant . " Cold showers , too . " <p> " Off-season , my ass , " my wife said as he left , and I 'm sure he heard us . " Camping in a fucking parking lot . " <p> As we set up the tent in the dark , the foggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the hero of the film , for most of it , could n't see three feet in front of his face . And neither could I. I could n't see the other end of the tent in the dark , so I did n't even know if the poles were straight or if my wife was standing by me . <p> You see , earlier in the evening I 'd refused her offering . Just before we sat down to dinner , she 'd taken out of her handbag-so I know she had it then-a small box wrapped in elaborate paper laced with gold thread . " Not now , " I said . I did n't know what it was . " Please , " I said , waving my hands in front of my face . " Not now . I just feel too raw . " <p> I 'd been cruel in the only way I 'd known how , by being distant and indifferent during our whole vacation . We 'd saved up for the past five years to travel , and now I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So you do n't get to really know her , you do n't get to see her close-up , which is not to say she ever admitted she 'd made a mistake , that she had any regrets , that she even knew what she was doing , though I forgot to say she was French , the brightest person in her graduating class at the Sorbonne , she spoke without a trace of an accent , and consequently got taken for an American . I do n't want to tell you how once she loved me deeply , she could n't be happy unless she called me at work once a day , she made me presents out of construction paper and made collages of my favorite movie scenes on video . I held her through nightmares , one of us worked while the other went to school , we wept together when it was impossible to bear a child . You know why I wo n't let you ? Because this is n't a story about love lost . And I refuse to give you metaphors about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country among enemies who should be friends . Do n't even make me think of what it felt like to slice my finger to the bone with a bread knife the next morning : the shock of ithow long did it last ? - was like an out-of-body experience . And you do n't get to meet any of the people who were nice to us in Greece either . <p> During the movie , I remember now , my mother had cursed the Turks because her own father died in 1916 at their hands in the Dardanelles , but during commercials , my mother offered a long , familiar riff on my father , which she issued with bitterness and rage , though in a soft voice , and with parenthetical apologies , saying she knew that my relationship with him differed from hers , but it was stupid for me to defend him , that I could n't possibly know how he treated her once the bedroom doors were closed , and then she opened her nightgown , exposing one of her breasts , and showed me a thin pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a slash , I did n't know , and at eleven , I did n't want to ask . " But your father is kind to you , " she said . And when he came home from work , she always wrapped her arms around him tightly , as if she had amnesia , as if she knew , being a mother of the fifties , that she 'd be on the street if she left . " He 's proud of you , as he should be . For that I give him credit . I do n't want to be unfair . " The Russian way she said credit , with the c sound about to deliver phlegm from her throat , I wo n't forget it . So when I think of my mother , I think of spit . <p> The hero-his name , I think , was Frank ( the names were as straightforward as the movies and the age ) - was lost without his love . When he saw couples kissing on the waterfront , he covered his eyes with his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days , every foreign country looked alike-who seemingly wanted to seduce him . There was no one left to trust . And when he saw someone from behind who looked like the thief of Trabzon , his face welled up with that manufactured rage you only find in old third-rate movies , as if the medium had not yet made the successful adjustment from theater , where feelings had to be so visible you could not mistake them : that 's actually what I wanted , as I revisit my mother peeling those carrots ( saying something innocently ugly to me , cursing at the hero ) - why do I feel numb every time her name is mentioned ? - and thinking then about how I 'd let my wife die from me , and how now I had to lie beside her in a tent in a foreign country where we were both , rightly-since we 'd given their dictators guns and dollars to prop them up-despised . <p> Just before I thought of the words The Tragic Stiletto ( earlier and later I mistakenly called it The Magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film , after it was completely dark , three junta soldiers armed with American AK-47 's picked up a young man around nineteen or twenty by the shoulders and took him away . It was all done silently , with dignity , and everyone who was n't sitting at that particular table , meaning his mother and girlfriend , acted completely absorbed by the melodrama on the television screen . The young woman tried to follow them , but her way was blocked by another soldier , while the older woman sat at the table holding her head in her hands . My wife-I 'll tell you her name , Justine-actually said , " Should we contact our embassy ? " <p> I looked at her and shook my head . " They 're probably behind it . " So you see what dialogue does , how it takes away more than it supplies , because you ca n't know what it felt like for her to hear that from me , whether she felt stung or relieved or saddened by my cynicism , or whether she was even listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my voice . <p> It took us at least an hour to set up the tent . Justine focused the flashlight on the instructions , and I spread the materials out . The instructions were in French , probably written by Bulgarians . We were missing a pole . I found a stick in the olive orchard that tore a hole in the canvas material . We sighed and cursed . Even with our clothes on the ground as a buffer , the sleeping bags could not soften the hard and bumpy gravel , and I could n't help but think of Hindus sleeping on beds of nails , thinking they were welcome to them . I wished they were Greek . <p> We had some grappa we 'd bought at the department store , and once the tent was up , we sat briefly inside it ( it was too small to stand in ) , cross-legged , and passed the bottle as if it were a peace pipe . " So this is our vacation ; ' I said , looking around the tent . <p> " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just a mirror image . " <p> " What can we do about it ? " She did n't say , so I continued talking . " You know , I 've been thinking about that guy . " " At the movie ? " <p> I nodded , though I was n't sure she could see my face . " But not him , really . The woman at the table with him , how she wanted to get up to help him , but could n't . " <p> " They just would have thrown her in jail . " <p> " Yeah . But he probably thinks she does n't give a damn . For all he knows , he 's going to rot in jail till the firing squad shoots him . " <p> " That 's melodramatic . Now you 're just projecting . " <p> " Please , Justine , I hate that kind of talk . I 'm just telling you how I felt . " <p> " No you 're not , you 're guessing at what he felt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her judgment simultaneously with the rightness of it . " I 'm sorry I jumped on you . " Then we were silent for a very long time before I said , " I want to forgive you , but I ca n't . " <p> " Because I 'm unforgivable ? " <p> " Of course not . No one 's unforgivable . " <p> " The junta 's unforgivable : ' <p> " Yeah , " I said laughing , " but you 're not the junta . " <p> " Yeah , but that 's what it feels like ? " I nodded . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I wish I could say it wo n't happen again . " <p> I wish I could say I asked her why . I wish I could have told her I felt ripped open , not about her sleeping with someone but about everything , not just what was happening to us . But it was n't talk we needed . So I closed my eyes and reached over to feel her hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then I heard vaguely in the background as I drifted off some accordion music and the clapping of hands , but I was too tired to try to figure out if it came from a dream or not . <p> You can probably guess what I dreamed of . In the movies I might have gotten a telegram that my mother had died , but in fact I was just hovering over her while she cried , asking her again and again , " What 's wrong , why do n't you do something ? " The dream had actually occurred several times in what we call real life , and I 'd often leave our house thinking , She does n't have to be alone if she does n't want to . She 's torturing me . But in the dream , I 'm like an angel , the angel I want to be , as well as the boy sitting beside her watching the movie , telling her I understand , I want to make her feel better , what can I do ? She does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when she reaches for my hand , she has a ring , or a coin , for me . <p> When I woke up , when I was awakened , it was by a man 's voice murmuring in Greek to a woman , and she was saying something like No , no , but in a tender voice , and it was clear after a while that he was trying to cajole her it was all right , nobody would know , it would feel good , whatever Greek man say in seducing a Greek woman , and behind them I heard loud music coming from the restaurant , but I knew I was n't dreaming . Justine elbowed me and whispered , " How could you sleep through this ? " Then she asked if I 'd get out of the tent and ask them to go away . <p> " What , in Greek ? At least you speak good French . They 'll go away . " And they did , after he apparently pushed her to the ground and gave it to her hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionately , Yannis . Justine and I were so ashamed . But as we lay down in our sleeping bags , the rocks pressing against our spines , I 'm thinking I ca n't wait till morning ; but then I hear a number of voices , I do n't know how many , and then I hear one of them laughing and unzipping his pants . I know it 's his pants because a moment later he 's saying , Amerikani , and he 's pissing on the tent , so I have to get up , I have to unzip the tent and stand before them in my underwear , but before I do , I slip into my jeans and feel my Swiss Army knife in my pocket , and I 'm suddenly furious , at Justine and the Greeks and the stupid movie and anybody who 's in my way . Amerikani , I hear , they 're calling to us , laughing , they 're calling me out , and I unzip the tent with my knife flashing , saying , " Bastards , you bastards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back away , but their fists are up , so I move toward them , stabbing the air , I move them toward the restaurant , knowing full well Justine has no passport as I walk away from her , and I lead them toward the bar , which is raucous and crowded , which smells of the tarry scent of Greek liquor and lamb and cigarettes-it all unfolds unbearably slowly like the movie-and I 'm scanning the room to see who it is-what-I have to kill , before I see the owner holding up a shot glass , and spying me doubling over in laughter , wrapping his arms around himself , and then he 's shouting in English , " My hero , my hero , " so there 's nothing else I can do but put the blade between my teeth and act like a pirate or an ape , swinging my arms loosely back and forth , jumping on a table and gesturing wildly until we 're all laughing , until I sit and drink with them and their girlfriends , each of us happily babbling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
