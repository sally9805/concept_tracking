<p> President Fidel Castro is groping for a solution to an economic crisis that prompted about 30,000 rafters to flee Cuba over the last six weeks , even as international attention turns to the Caribbean 's other hot spot , Haiti . <p> Growing unemployment and poverty are threatening to turn this island nation into a second regional powder keg . Cubans say the classless utopia that Castro tried to construct here after his 1959 revolution is heading in much the same direction as the communist regimes that collapsed in 1989 across the Soviet Bloc in Europe . <p> Signs are evident throughout this capital that Castro is slowly abandoning his Marxist command economy in pursuit of measures aimed at attracting needed hard currency . <p> Capitalism , once the enemy of the people , is now openly practiced with seeming encouragement from authorities . <p> At the University of Havana last Monday , Cuban officials announced the start of a new master's-level course in capitalist economics taught by a team of professors from Canada 's Carleton University . <p> " It 's the first time in 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Archibald Ritter , the Canadian coordinator of the two-year program . " This is basically to teach Cuban students the theory of mainstream economics . We 're not calling it capitalism , but that 's essentially what it is . We 're referring to it as the ' economics of renovation . ' " <p> As little as five years ago , just the suggestion of such a course would have been tantamount to treason , Cubans say . But a longstanding U.S. commercial embargo and the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union , Cuba 's main benefactor , have wreaked havoc on this economy and forced Castro to make compromises previously unthinkable . <p> " People point to Fidel as some kind of megalomaniacal ideologue . Outsiders think he 's unswerving in his commitment to communism . I really do n't think that 's the case , " a Western diplomat said . " Reluctantly , slowly , haltingly , the process is moving forward on the economic front , " even though Castro still rules out any changes in the political framework that keeps him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more dramatic measures to change living conditions , the lid eventually will blow . A signal of the magnitude of the problems emerged Aug. 5 , when hundreds of protesters against Castro 's policies clashed with police in downtown Havana . <p> Cubans say the accord with the United States to halt raft departures and boost U.S. visa grants will do nothing to change the country 's more profound problems . Castro 's cost-cutting measures , including strict food and gasoline rationing , nightly power outages and water cutoffs , are pushing even his followers ' limits of endurance . <p> " Things have to change , and they will . I can feel it . I just hope they change before there is violence or war , " said a mid-level Foreign Ministry official . <p> Raul Castro , Fidel 's brother and second in command , signaled a major change in an interview published Saturday , saying free agricultural markets would be operating " very soon , " Reuter reported from Havana . A decade ago , experiments with " farmers ' markets " selling to private customers rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black markets serve as farmers ' markets . <p> Castro 's first open step toward " renovation " was his legalization last year of the U.S. dollar in all domestic transactions . As a result , the Cuban peso virtually has been eliminated as the nation 's currency . <p> Even at the Museum of the Revolution in central Havana , where the history of Castro 's struggle against capitalism and U.S. imperialism is chronicled in photos and exhibits , admission prices are set in dollars . <p> On the streets , renovation economics started taking root shortly after aid from the Soviet Bloc began drying up in the mid-1980s . Along the seafront Malecon boulevard , hundreds of hucksters and prostitutes flag down tourists day and night while police stand idly by . <p> The theory behind the government 's toleration , a Havana man associated with a prostitution ring said , is that any activity prompting foreigners to spend dollars ultimately benefits the state . " Eventually , all of that money passes through Fidel 's house . So it is good for Cuba , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A prostitute hovered nearby , as another dozen or so waved at passing rental cars . <p> " Four years ago , nobody even thought of doing what I do , " said Ania , a 20-year-old prostitute , underestimating by at least three years the point at which streetwalkers began to reappear in Cuba . " These days , girls are doing it everywhere . I 'm not talking about women , I mean girls , like 13- and 14-year-olds . They 'll do it just for a meal . " <p> The effect of Castro 's legalization of dollar-based trading has been to create a new middle class of prostitutes , hotel bellboys , waiters and anyone else with direct access to foreigners and their dollars . <p> A hotel bellboy , for example , earns in a week the equivalent of the annual salary for a Cuban doctor with 10 years experience . A prostitute can earn that in a night . <p> Ania said she sacrificed her dignity , as well as virginity , several years ago after her sister came into her room crying one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went with a Filipino who paid me $ 20 , " she said . " I cried for days after I did it . My mother screamed at me . But she knows why I did it and why I have to keep on doing it . " Since Ania started in the trade , four other girls in her apartment complex have joined her on the streets . Parents do not complain , she said , as " there is no other choice . " <p> If given an alternative , Ania said , " I would like to be able to start up my own business , maybe open a day-care center . " No such dream can be realized , because Castro bans for-profit businesses , although Ania acknowledged that her work amounts to that . <p> Many Cubans , bombarded with anti-capitalist propaganda from the time they enter school , say socialism offers a more equitable form of economic management . But they acknowledge that Castro 's socialist model has not lived up to promises . <p> " They could double my salary and it would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a 1,000-bed Havana hospital who , after 10 years on the job , earns the peso equivalent of $ 4 per month at the black-market rate . To supplement his income , Leonel sells meat from a secret pig farm . <p> " Socialism once brought us one of the best health-care systems in the world . I can not say we have advanced since about 1970 , " Leonel said , as he performed an antiquated kidney-dialysis procedure on a middle-aged man . He said he knows of no other country using such outmoded technology . <p> Nevertheless , he said , " The quality of care is very high because we are dedicated to our work . But let 's say I did n't have the money to buy breakfast today , or maybe my electricity is out , or I have n't had water to take a shower for a few days . I do n't care how dedicated I am , I 'm going to come to work feeling lousy , and it 's the patient who suffers . " <p> Conservative members of the Cuban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. embargo in hopes that the Cuban people will rise up against Castro . Earlier this summer , Clinton cut off remittances that Cuban Americans send here to help their families survive , and which the Western diplomat said accounted for $ 500 million a year in income for Cuba . Remittances are second only to tourism in producing foreign exchange . <p> But now that Cubans have acquired a taste for dollars and limited forms of entrepreneurship , many here argue that the embargo is actually helping Castro maintain control and preventing full-blown capitalism from taking over . <p> " There is a theory that if you open the floodgates and dump commerce and dollars into this economy , you will bring Castro down much more quickly . You essentially kill him with kindness , " the diplomat said . <p> A diplomat from a former Eastern Bloc country disagreed . " I 'm afraid the Miami Cubans are right . If you flood this place with dollars , they will only end up in Castro 's pocket . I know how this works because I 've seen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , " he said .
