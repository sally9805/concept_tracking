<p> In three days , the last of the winter 's eagerly awaited big new musicals will open on Broadway : Paul Simon 's $11 million " Capeman , " based on the true story of a Puerto Rican gang murder that became a tabloid sensation nearly four decades ago . <p> But unlike " The Lion King " or " Ragtime , " which moved fairly smoothly into their Broadway bows , " The Capeman " has struggled fitfully and publicly toward its opening , leading to unwanted speculation about whether the celebrated songwriter 's first Broadway effort would end up as a jewel or a thorn in his crown . <p> " The Capeman " has gone through three directors , and although the choreographer Mark Morris remains the director of record , he has been largely absent from the day-to-day work on the show for weeks . The job of polishing the musical has been turned over to Jerry Zaks , a four-time Tony winner , who was hired a month ago . <p> Under Mr. Zaks , several songs have been dropped or altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choreography has been redone by Joey McKneely a choreographer who is a part of Mr. Zaks 's team . The musical 's length has been cut by half an hour , to about 2 hours 25 minutes . And , most important , the producers say , the story line has been clarified . <p> " Jerry Zaks has done a brilliant job , a brilliant job , " said Dan Klores , one of the producers . " His mission was to tighten the show and tell the story , and he has accomplished that . " <p> Mr. Zaks said of his work : " I 've done about as much as I can do with what 's there . I 'm just trying to clarify , tell the story . " <p> Marc Anthony , who plays the title character , Salvador Agron , as a young man , said last week that he and other cast members felt that the show was in great shape and ready to open . " We 're all really excited , " he said . " Paul is smiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough decisions , but they pulled it through . We made it through the rain . " <p> The show 's original Jan. 8 opening was postponed in December , when it became clear to Mr. Simon and the show 's producers that the storytelling was inadequate , Mr. Klores said . A string of A-list directors wentto see the musical , including Mike Nichols and Nicholas Hytner , and offered suggestions . Mr. Zaks was eventually hired to doctor the show . <p> Though producers say that Mr. Zaks 's changes have been approved by Mr. Morris , they also acknowledge that Mr. Morris has been working with his own dance company since Jan. 10 , and has stepped in only occasionally to monitor progress on " The Capeman . " <p> Mr. Morris , who had directed several operas but never a musical , disagreed with the producers ' decision to postpone the opening . Once that decision was made , it became clear to Mr. Morris that his role would be diminished , so he decided to abide by long-standing commitments he had for other projects this month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The handover to Mr. Zaks was amicable , Mr. Morris said . " I am somewhat relieved , " he said . " I 'm happy that he was able to do when he came in the things I did n't have the power to make happen . " <p> Still , Mr. Alterman said , " bringing Jerry in was not easy for Mark . " He added , " Something like this has never , ever , ever happened to him before . " <p> The decision to postpone was also an expensive one . Extra rehearsals and Mr. Zaks 's fees added at least a half-million dollars to the show 's cost , said Edgar Dobie , another of the show 's producers . The expense was mitigated , in part , by the musical 's unusually strong advance sales , although four performances were canceled to provide time to put in Mr. Zaks 's changes . <p> Before the postponement , " The Capeman " was selling $100,000 worth of tickets every day , a high figure for a show in previews . And since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the musical has been selling $50,000 to $80,000 a day , said Mr. Dobie , who maintains that the show has stayed within its $11 million budget . <p> The number of changes made during the nearly two months of previews is hardly unheard of for Broadway shows , especially those , like " The Capeman , " that had no out-of-town tryouts . The producers had considered first staging " The Capeman " in another city , but rejected the plan to save money . Now , they are living with the downside of that decision . <p> " Obviously , no one likes to be in this fishbowl , " Mr. Dobie said . " It 's very difficult and very painful when you 're having your work critiqued , when conjecture is rampant about what 's going on . " Stirring Skepticism In Theater People <p> What has been unusual is the intense level of scrutiny that these changes have drawn , largely because of Mr. Simon 's celebrity and the roster of other big names associated with the show : Mr. Morris ; the Nobel Prize-winning poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lyrics , and the stars , Ruben Blades , Ednita Nazario and Mr. Anthony . <p> Mr. Klores , Mr. Zaks and others involved in the production , however , said it was unfair that the show had been subjected to such close examination during its preview phase , when shows traditionally work out their kinks . Mr. Simon 's celebrity , they said , has magnified every tiny bump in the road . <p> Mr. Simon declined to be interviewed for this article , and Mr. Walcott was unavailable . <p> Both " The Lion King " and " Ragtime " opened after long pre-Broadway runs in other cities , " The Lion King " in Minneapolis and " Ragtime " in Toronto and Los Angeles . Thus they had the chance to work out their problems long before New York audiences were exposed to them . <p> " The Capeman , " however , has gone through a difficult labor in full view of theater professionals who were already skeptical about the pop star 's announced intention to go to Broadway and reinvigorate a musical form for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingratiate himself with them . " I really could n't care less about what the theater community , or whatever it is that they call themselves , thinks about this work , " Mr. Simon said in an interview in this month 's Vogue magazine , for instance . " Because , quite frankly , I did n't write it for Broadway . I wrote it for me . " <p> He went on in the Vogue interview to criticize the sound systems in most Broadway theaters and the audiences he encountered during a " dreary round of theatergoing " while researching his Broadway options . " At every show save for ' Rent , ' the faces were glum and dutiful and anesthetized , " he said . " There was no sense of joy or awe or being transported . " <p> Any estrangement between " The Capeman " and the theater industry may also stem from the fact that with the exception of Mr. Dobie , who has worked with Andrew Lloyd Webber on several shows , the " Capeman " team was essentially made up of Broadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , film , television , corporate America , publishing , and I have never seen a community that disdains outsiders as much as Broadway , " Mr. Klores said . <p> Several people connected with the show say they are concerned that this has created a situation in which many Broadway professionals are rooting for " The Capeman " to stumble , and feeding the ever-willing tabloid gossip mill with enough grist to hobble the production . <p> " People should wait and see the show when it 's ready and judge it then , for what it is , " Mr. Klores said . " That 's all we 're asking . " <p> Mr. Simon , a noted perfectionist who had never worked on as intensely collaborative a project as a Broadway musical , has consistently shown a need to control every aspect of the show . He dismissed two directors , Susana Tubert and Eric Simonson , before settling on Mr. Morris . ( His most famous partnership , with Art Garfunkel , " was n't really much of a collaboration , " Mr. Simon has said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you 're done it 's done , " Mr. Alterman said . " The reality of theater is that once you 're done , that 's when it starts . And he 's embraced the process wholeheartedly . " Seeing Difficulty In Making Changes <p> And Mr. Simon was not the only reluctant collaborator . <p> James Lada , an assistant director under Mr. Morris who has since left the production , said Mr. Walcott was often obstinate about making text changes that Mr. Morris felt were necessary . " Mark was very respectful of Derek 's and Paul 's work , " Mr. Lada said . " He would n't say , ' Could you change it to this ? ' He 'd say , ' Could you re-examine this ? ' and Derek would argue about it . Sometimes I think Mark was too respectful of the work . Trying to get a change made was like pulling teeth . " <p> In the first weeks of previews , the show that Mr. Morris staged satisfied neither Mr. Simon nor the producers . " The producers were looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mark was n't proposing those changes , " Mr. Lada said . <p> When Mr. Zaks came aboard , though , he offered numerous proposals . " I would sit down every day and work out a battle plan for changes that I thought would be useful , and then outline them to Paul , " Mr. Zaks said . " His basic response was , ' Try it . ' " <p> Indeed , Mr. Zaks has been able to try sweeping changes , and Mr. Simon went along with most of it . " I get a sense he has n't gotten a very good rap about collaborating , " Mr. Zaks said , " but the back-and-forth on this has been very open and very trusting . "
