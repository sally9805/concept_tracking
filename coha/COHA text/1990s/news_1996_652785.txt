<p> Until 1991 the pop music charts were notoriously unreliable . Paying off record store employees with free albums , concert tickets and even vacations and washing machines was the standard music-business method of manipulating record sales figures . Even the Billboard magazine charts , considered the most prestigious in the business , were compiled from store managers ' oral reports , which were inaccurate to begin with and easily swayed . <p> That was before Soundscan . Five years ago , this company in Hartsdale , N.Y. , began compiling Billboard 's charts a new way , using a point-of-sale computer system that tallied sales of each record by picking up the bar code scanned at the cash registers of thousands of stores . <p> Soundscan added a legitimacy and authority to the charts . Payoffs became a thing of the past . " Today , the only way to make a record go higher on the charts is to sell more copies , " Bruce Haring writes in his new book on music-industry subterfuge , " Off the Charts " ( Birch Lane Press ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for loopholes in a tax law , there are those in the music business who have found ways to exploit even Soundscan 's sophisticated system . <p> Before 1995 , a single had never e'tered the pop charts in any of the top five positions in its first week of release . Last year , four singles had their debuts at No. 1 : " You Are Not Alone , " by Michael Jackson ; " Exhale ( Shoop Shoop ) , " by Whitney Houston , and " Fantasy " and " One Sweet Day , " by Mariah Carey . <p> Was the singles market suddenly stronger ? No , record companies were learning how to influence the charts . <p> Last week , record stores around the country received this fax from Columbia Records , the label for which Ms. Carey records , and Round the Globe Music , a marketing company : " Attention all Soundscan R &B; singles panelists . Your product is on the way . Mariah Carey , " One Sweet Day . " We 're going for No. 1 this week . Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? <p> " What we do is we talk to the stores , " said Neil Levine , president of Round the Globe . " We try to get them to put the records on sale or position them well to give them an added push . A lot of the time we 'll send them in-store play copies of various records so they can discount them . Our job is trying to get a record to first place , so we do weekly faxes to retail stores . That was n't in any way a bribe . " <p> One East Coast record-store owner who received the fax has another explanation . " One hand washes another , " he said , speaking on the condition of anonymity . " If we do them a favor , they 'll do us a favor . " <p> The fax is not the only way Columbia helped push " One Sweet Day " to No. 1 , where it has remained for nine weeks . The label also encouraged a rush of sales in the early weeks by giving out free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four singles for the price of one . Stores could then put " One Sweet Day " on sale for 49 to 99 cents , more than $2 below the average price of a single . This has become a common practice for promoting high-priority releases . <p> " One of the things that we 've learned is , you build a better mousetrap and all of a sudden the mouse starts finding ways to get around your trap , " said Michael Shalett , who founded and runs Soundscan with his partner , Mike Fine . " Record companies have realized that you can get a record up the charts real high by giving it a sort of running start . " <p> One way in which labels accomplish this , Mr. Shalett said , is to release a single to radio and wait until it receives heavy airplay before making it available commercially . Because a single is not eligible for the charts until it goes on sale , this insures that it enters the singles charts , calculated by a combination of sales and radio play , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumped up the song way high on the radio , all of a sudden you release the single and sell it for 49 cents , " he said . " And I 'm not aware of any economist who knows how to make money at that price . " <p> Aside from maneuvers like these , Mr. Shalett maintains that Sound scan is virtually foolproof . " We 're talking about campfire and nuclear power when it comes to where we were five or six years ago and where we are now in terms of realm of accuracy , " he said . <p> Certainly Soundscan has changed the way the music industry does business . In addition to enabling record labels to plan their marketing campaigns more effectively , sales statistics , which thanks to Soundscan can be broken down by region and genre , are crucial factors in the programming decisions of radio stations and MTV as well as in the planning of a tour , from the choice of an opening act to the number of concerts planned in each city . <p> But the more the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to gain by artificially inflating them . The easiest way to do this is to concentrate on independent retailers . Because Soundscan is in every major record chain but only in a small fraction of independent stores , records sold at the independents are weighted to account for the retailers that do not report to Soundscan . For example , one record sold at Upstairs , an independent rap store in Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn , will show up on Soundscan as three records sold . This way Soundscan , which tracks 85 percent of record sales , ends up with a figure that estimates 100 percent of sales . <p> " With projects where there is a potential for tremendous sales , doing the things necessary to get your Soundscan figures up is pennies compared with what you will get when it sells two million records , " said a sales executive at a record label who spoke on condition of anonymity . <p> " It 's common practice to tweak your sales by giving free singles to mom-and-pop stores in quantity  --  from 60 to 90 cassettes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And some retailers will scan goods before they pass the counter and then scan them again when they 're sold so they 'll get a double hit . " <p> Though there are safeguards in Soundscan 's system that alert the company when an unfeasible number of records are scanned at a single store in a short period of time , an album that is scanned just one or two extra times can escape undetected . But Mr. Shalett of Soundscan says that overscanning is impractical for stores . <p> " It 's hard for a clerk who might want to go scanning something he did n't sell a bunch of times to affect the chart , " he said , " because every time you scan something , you 're taking something out of inventory , and the store manager is going to have a big problem trying to reconcile the nightly deposit . " <p> " Am I going to sit here and tell you that there have n't been times where people have played some sort of games with Soundscan ? " Well , several times we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labels have been accused of is replacing the bar codes on older catalogue albums with those of new albums whose sales they want to boost . Soundscan denies that this happens intentionally . <p> Charlie Davin , the singles buyer at Tower Records in Greenwich Village , said : " I 've heard stories of bar codes being switched around , but when I 've priced my product and that happens we send it back to the record label . I would n't put a Fugees single on the racks when it was coming up as a Mariah Carey single . " <p> Several record-label executives described how playing with the charts could turn a borderline record into a major hit : In a crucial market like New York or Los Angeles , a label will load up retailers that report to Soundscan with free or discounted copies of a record . It will also send field representatives into stores to buy the album in small quantities and make deals for the store to display the record prominently , play it on the in-house sound system and in some cases scan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations to put the single or album on their play list , based on its regional popularity according to Soundscan . If it becomes a hit in one influential market , other stations around the country will usually start playing it . If the video is good , MTV will then put it into rotation and , as one of these executives said , all of a sudden you have a hit . <p> A complaint about Soundscan is that it ignores certain music genres sold primarily in specialty stores . Dance-music , reggae , New Age and Latin music shops are among Soundscan 's most often cited oversights . The computer equipment necessary for a store to go electronic can cost $5,000 , and although record labels sometimes offer to share the expenses , some retailers lack the resources . <p> Last summer , the company made an effort to add some Christian bookstores as reporters . Though only two Christian-music artists had appeared on the charts before , nearly a dozen have done so since . <p> Records sold at such nontraditional record outlets as supermarkets and gift shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' double album " Anthology 1 " was released in November , for example , Capitol Records sent out a press release stating that the album had sold 200,000 more copies than Soundscan 's figure of 855,000 . ( Capitol said it based the figure on oral reports from retailers . ) <p> As Soundscan enters its sixth year of compiling the pop charts , is it facing a future of even more schemes and more sophisticated schemes aimed at manipulating its sales figures ? Perhaps , but for now the company and music industry officials agree that behind-the-scenes tinkering will only get a record so far . <p> " One thing that Soundscan has proven is that you can fake it some of the way up the chart but you ca n't fake it all the way , " said a record label executive who spoke on condition of anonymity . " Ultimately , if the record does n't work with people , no matter how much you pervert the figures it does n't matter . What these things can only do is help expose a record . From that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide . "
