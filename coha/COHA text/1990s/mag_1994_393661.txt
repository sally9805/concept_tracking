When I was growing up , my mother had a small carved Buddha 's head in her room . I remember it as a witness to my childhood , with its mysterious expression , enigmatic half smile and serene brow . My dog , on the other hand , was totally spooked and generally could n't bear to be in the same room with it . I was reminded recently of how this little stone head carved out its own presence in the room on seeing a new collection of furniture by Judy Kensley McKie . Exhibited at the Pritam &; Eames Gallery in East Hampton , New York ( August 13-September 20 ) , these pieces convey an austerity and sense of mystery that seem a departure from McKie 's earlier work . The humor and whimsy I associate with her odd menagerie have been replaced by something different . It 's not that these pieces have the religious quality of a carved Buddha 's head . But there is a strength of spirit here . These solitary beasts stake out their own territory in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior animation . These are all objects that could spook the dog . Consider the Mirror with Black Birds . Had I been titling it , I might have called it The Way A Nightmare Finds Its Composure for the manner in which a swarm of black birds gracefully and ominously encircles the square of glass . So far as I can tell , McKie has composed a nightmare using an unlikely mixture of lyricism and horror . It is exactly such ambiguity that enlivens these works , an ambiguity that McKie takes to the limit throughout the collection . Jack Lenor Larsen suggests in the press release announcing the exhibit that the primitive animal imagery in McKie 's work has precedents in the images found in Rousseau 's paintings or Gauguin 's woodblocks . To my mind , it is closer to what you might get if Alfred Hitchcock were animating Merrie Melodies cartoons . It 's not that the forms are sinister , exactly . It 's just that McKie has taken ordinary domestic furnishings such as a cupboard , a table , a bench and given them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In part , this may be a sign of the times : we no longer take for granted the idea that the domestic realm is benign . Indeed , we recognize it as an ambiguous landscape full of its own dangers and deceits . McKie 's animal presences , then , often seem predatory , mysterious , remote . And in so being , they reflect the uncertain nature of the place we call home . Ambiguity has always been an element in McKie 's work ; she has admitted that when her work becomes too representational or specific in its animal imagery , it loses some of its power . Yet this ambiguity has never been so determined or so clearly expressed as it is here . In speaking about the 400-pound Lion Bench , the show 's centerpiece , McKie says , " The face of the lion switches from a grin to a growl . " Her statement articulates the larger spirit of the collection as well . McKie 's pieces have always walked the line between the grin and the growl , but their gait and balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is not as simple as it once was . In an interview in the accompanying catalogue , McKie states that she is most pleased when viewers " get this immediate enjoyment or pleasure from the work ... They just look at it and it makes them smile . " As a viewer , I do n't buy that . Or perhaps , if it is a smile , it 's a nervous one . What gives these works their edge ? For one thing , the beasts are confrontational . McKie 's creatures have always had a direct , frontal quality , which is in part why they come across as being primitive . The Lion Bench , the Monkey Chair , the Fox Table , even the series of quizzical expressions incised into the surface of Female Vessel  --  all have a head-on approach . Too , their tactile quality invites the user to engage them physically . There is a genuine , even friendly , accessibility . Yet for all their confrontation , indeed , their intimacy , they maintain distance ; they remain a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , aloof . This contradiction underscores their tension and ambiguity all the more ; it is also what so captures the viewer 's imagination . The strength in McKie 's new pieces has a physical source as well : half of them are of cast bronze . Not that you 'd know that right away  --  the bronze often comes across as wood . Forms appear to be gently turned or carved , with a warmth one associates with wood or clay ( particularly today , when most metal furniture tends to be aggressive , even harsh , playing against traditional notions of comfort ) . Only when one touches these pieces is it apparent that they are metal . Considering the permanence and endurance of bronze , it is not surprising that such strength inhabits them . " Bronze gives a different weight to the work , " McKie says . In some instances , the choice of bronze was determined by form . The serpentine support of the Snake Shelf or the spiraling tail composing the back of the Monkey Chair could best be constructed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be costly , time-consuming , impractical . The dark bronze patina is especially effective in the Monkey Choir , where it seems to meld organically with the dark grain of the walnut seat . Again , it is an ambiguity , this time of materials  --  wood and metal  --  and their interplay that gives the work its interest and its edge . In other cases , however , it was the imagery that determined the material . The totemic form of the Lion Bench has greater authority in bronze than it might have had in wood . Likewise , Female Vessel conveys quality of age that is more aptly expressed in bronze than in wood . Both its surface incisions and the worn hues of its patina evoke a sense of history . This work in particular appears to have been unearthed , if not from some archaeological mound , then perhaps from the depths of the human psyche . " I am interested in images that have been handed down through the ages , " says McKie . " I try to use finishes that make these pieces look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images to convey the idea of a time line , sense of connectedness . " Considering the assurance of these works , I was not surprised to learn that they were constructed during a time of extreme and deliberate focus . " I did n't accept any commissions during this period , " McKie says . " There were fewer deadlines and because of that , greater direction . " There is a reason that the spirit of continuity is so central . In discussing the evolution of an artist 's work , personal circumstances may play a part . In McKie 's case , what can only be described as a spiritual component in the work is the residual from a loss in her life , the death of her son , Jesse , in 1990 . These artifacts , with their intimations of endurance , emerge as potent and unswerving witnesses from that realm reserved for parents who have lost their children . " For a long time I was unable to work , " Judy McKie tells me . " Later , when I began to work again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes , it was my gift to him . But it was also a way of connecting to the world . I feel so fortunate to have had my work . " It is no surprise , then , that this collection reads as such a gift to us .
