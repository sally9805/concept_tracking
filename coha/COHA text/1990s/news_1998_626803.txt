<p> The first few weeks of the season 's second half will help some teams determine whether it 's time to bolster or break up . <p> Clubs like the Yankees , Braves , Indians , Padres and Astros need not worry themselves with this process . They know they 're good enough to realize the goals they set for themselves at the beginning of the season . <p> Other teams fell well short of their expectations in the first half and now must choose between going for broke or playing for next year and beyond . <p> Here are some of those clubs that face that dilemma and the direction each might choose to take : <p> BALTIMORE - The Orioles have been the biggest disappointment in baseball , considering owner Peter Angelos spent $ 73 million on player salaries . The Orioles have no chance of catching the Yankees , who are streaking toward the best record in major-league history . They 're also kidding themselves if they think they 're going to compete for the wild-card spot . <p> It 's time to cut their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so is Rafael Palmeiro . Both would fetch some nice prospects in just about any deal . <p> " Whatever needs to be done will be done , " Angelos said . " Obviously , we 'll do what 's necessary . If somebody has a deal out there to offer us , we 're here . If it sounds good , we 'll take it . If not , we 'll look elsewhere . I 'm not ruling anything out . " <p> SEATTLE - Because there is no dominant team in the AL West , the Mariners can afford to hold out hope a little longer than the Orioles , but only if they are committed to getting some serious help in the bullpen . <p> The guess here is that the bullpen is n't going to change , and if that 's the case , neither are the Mariners . Their biggest bargaining chip is Randy Johnson , who will make some contending team very happy down the stretch . For the time being , the Mariners claim Johnson is staying put . <p> ST . LOUIS - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the disabled list . In the meantime , they were falling farther off the pace in the NL Central . They need a lot of pitching help - more than they can hope to acquire in three months . <p> Their best bet is to trade soon-to-be free agents Brian Jordan and Royce Clayton and begin preparing for 1999 . The Padres are interested in Clayton , and Jordan 's list of suitors includes the Giants , Red Sox and Mets . <p> COLORADO - Things are so bad in Denver , Darryl Kile trade rumblings already have begun to surface . This is the same guy they signed to a three-year , $ 24 million contract with hopes he would pitch them into the postseason . <p> It 's not going to happen for the Rockies this season . Outfielders Ellis Burks and Dante Bichette will be free agents at the end of the season , so the Rockies might as well trade them now and at least get something in return . <p> LOS ANGELES - The Dodgers are arguably the most intriguing team in baseball . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent is talent nonetheless . <p> It 's too late for the Dodgers to throw in the towel . They 've already traded away two of their best prospects to get Jeff Shaw from Cincinnati , and they clearly are in a win-now mode . Anything less than a playoff berth would be a disappointment . The wild card is their only hope . <p> Around the National League <p> Triple play - A three-player deal involving San Diego , Cincinnati and Detroit is believed to be in the works . <p> The deal would send Padres starter Joey Hamilton to Detroit , Reds righthander Pete Harnisch and a Tigers pitching prospect to San Diego , and a pair of Tigers prospects to the Reds . <p> The Padres , much like the Astros , believe they need another top-notch starter to beat the Braves in a playoff series . They are only willing to give up on the talented but underachieving Hamilton if they can find someone with proven credentials . <p> " For us to trade the likes of a Joey Hamilton , it 's going to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin Towers said . " Three or four clubs have inquired about Joey . But the only way we would trade Joey is if it improved our club this year and for future years . And even in that case , I do n't know if we 'd do it . " <p> Longing at short - That 's not all that 's in the rumor mill for the Padres . They still are n't convinced they can go to the World Series with Chris Gomez as their everyday shortstop . <p> The Padres continue to consider trading for the Cardinals ' Royce Clayton or the Reds ' Barry Larkin . The latest shortstop to surface is Florida 's Edgar Renteria , whom the Marlins might be willing to move in favor of minor-league phenom Alex Gonzalez . <p> Brave dealings - The Braves ' bullpen is a mess , and it 's becoming a source of hope for the other NL pennant contenders . <p> In addition to finding a closer in case Mark Wohlers does n't regain his form , the Braves also need a lefthanded reliever , preferably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but manager Bobby Cox has been caught in a few late-inning mismatches where another lefty might have come in handy . <p> The more pressing matter involves Wohlers , who has n't been impressive at Class AAA . The Braves tried to acquire Jeff Shaw , but the Reds found a better deal with the Dodgers . <p> Other possibilities include Randy Myers , Mark Leiter and former Astro Todd Jones , who suddenly is on the trading block in Detroit . <p> Not over the Hill - A few people in baseball were scratching their heads when the Marlins waived seemingly tradeable outfielder Glenallen Hill during the All-Star break . <p> No one was surprised he got picked up so quickly . The Cubs claimed the veteran outfielder , who could form a nice left-field platoon with free-swinging Henry Rodriguez . <p> " He 's got 12 homers , 20 doubles , 33 RBI ; good numbers , " Cubs general manager Ed Lynch said of Hill . " He 'll give us something that we needed . " <p> Hill , who played in 74 games with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release . <p> Playing for one - The Mets had been looking forward to this weekend all season . <p> Todd Hundley was expected to return to the lineup Saturday , but his old position has been filled . The switch-hitting catcher will play in the outfield , while All-Star Mike Piazza handles the catching duties . <p> The Mets are 5 1/2 games behind the Giants in the wild-card race , but they are hoping Hundley can help them close the gap . <p> " I 'm not going to come in and be the savior of the team , " Hundley said . " It takes 25 guys to win . I 'm not going to come in and carry the team . I 'm just going to do my thing , be Todd Hundley and hit the ball hard and try to get the offense going . <p> " It 's definitely different playing the outfield , but I 'm willing to do that . I 've gotten used to that long run out there . It 'll be a totally different perspective at Shea Stadium , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ready to go - Now that the Dodgers have traded for closer Jeff Shaw , incumbent Antonio Osuna has asked to be traded . There is a great demand for righthanded relief pitching , so Dodgers interim general manager Tommy Lasorda should n't have any problem moving the disgruntled pitcher . <p> General managers around the league are lining up to fleece Lasorda . <p> After Lasorda gave up top prospect Paul Konerko and Dennis Reyes for Shaw , one NL scout said : " I would n't have traded either of those kids straight up for Shaw . " <p> Only natural - The Phillies should give some serious consideration to replacing the turf at Veterans Stadium with natural grass . Their future could depend on it . <p> " Scott ( Rolen ) told me that when his contract is up , he might have to go somewhere else , " Phillies ace Curt Schilling said . " He thinks it would be hard for him to play every day on turf , and I understand that . " <p> Rolen , the NL 's Rookie of the Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American League <p> Mo money - The Red Sox and first baseman Mo Vaughn are right where they were at the beginning of season - at each other 's throats . <p> At issue is Vaughn 's contract , which will expire at the end of the season . The Red Sox 's latest offer - a four-year deal worth $ 37 million - was turned down , and it does n't appear the two sides are close to an agreement . <p> Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette is reluctant to give Vaughn more than the three-year , $ 28.5 million deal Mark McGwire signed with the Cardinals . McGwire 's annual average salary is $ 9.5 million , and the Red Sox 's offer to Vaughn averages $ 9.25 million a year . <p> Vaughn , who wants to average at least $ 10 million a year , said McGwire gave the Cardinals a " hometown discount " because of special circumstances . Vaughn argues that McGwire was bowled over by the reception he received in St. Louis and the thought of closing out his career with manager/close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Mariners center fielder has been jokingly referring to Russ Davis as " 58 . " <p> That 's because Davis will be the 58th left fielder Ken Griffey Jr . has played with during his career in Seattle . Because Davis has been so error-prone at third base - his 25 errors lead the majors - the Mariners have decided to shift him to the outfield . <p> Left field opened up when Glenallen Hill was placed on waivers during the All-Star break . <p> Clearing the air - Tigers outfielder Bobby Higginson lit into closer Todd Jones after a recent loss to the Minnesota Twins in which Jones threw to the wrong base in the ninth inning . <p> Jones was making light of his miscue , and Higginson did n't appreciate it . The clubhouse went silent after Higginson 's outburst . <p> " That 's probably the first time I 've ever said anything in front of anybody , " Higginson said . " But the situation was really bothering me . It needed to be said . <p> " It was something that was n't taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a team struggling like us - I ca n't stress enough - we ca n't afford to give teams extra outs . We 're not good enough to do that . " <p> Staying power - The White Sox have a longstanding policy requiring players to sign autographs for the fans on the field before select home games . <p> As you might imagine , Albert Belle participates , but he certainly does n't like it . <p> " I told ( owner ) Jerry Reinsdorf and ( general manager ) Ron Schueler that giving autographs and conducting giveaways and playing music ca n't replace winning , " Belle said . " The Indians did n't draw many fans when they built their stadium , but as soon as they started winning , the fans came out . " <p> Some White Sox , including pitcher Jaime Navarro , have asked to be traded , but Belle intends to stick through the rough times . <p> " I told ( manager ) Jerry Manuel I 'm going down with the ship , " Belle said . " I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed a contract , and I 'm going to do it . We have to keep the same group and run ' em out there every day . You never know what 's going to happen with free agents in the offseason . Obviously , you 'd like to get someone right now , but that 's not going to happen . " <p> Credit where due - Roger Clemens was the only Blue Jay selected for the All-Star Game , but he felt at least four of his teammates were worthy of consideration . So Clemens made sure each was represented in some way or another . <p> He packed a bat from Jose Canseco , jerseys from Paul Quantrill and Woody Williams , and a cap from Dan Plesac . <p> " Those guys have all had great years , " Clemens said . " They are big reasons why we 're still lingering around in the wild-card race . Middle and late relief are so important , and Dan and Paul have both done great jobs . Jose has a chance at 40-40 ( 40 home runs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having , he deserved a chance to be here . " <p> Just wishing - Rangers general manager Doug Melvin talked to a few general managers at the All-Star Game about the possibility of acquiring a starting pitcher , but most clubs want prospects who are close to being major-league ready , and the Rangers do n't have much to offer . <p> Melvin has inquired about Cincinnati 's Pete Harnisch and Kansas City 's Tim Belcher . The pitcher Melvin and manager Johnny Oates really wants is Minnesota 's Bob Tewksbury . <p> On a roll - Indians slugger Jim Thome led the AL with 93 strikeouts during the first half of the season and is own pace to strike out 153 times , which would break his own club record for most strikeouts in a season by a lefthander . <p> But the Indians will live with the whiffs as long as Thome continues to drive in runs . He 's on pace to drive in 146 runs , which would be the third-highest total in franchise history . <p> Triple your pleasure - The Red Sox had three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - with at least 10 wins at the All-Star break . This could be a good omen . <p> The last time that happened was 1975 , when Luis Tiant , Rick Wise and Bill Lee formed the trio . That club reached the World Series . In fact , the Red Sox have gone to the World Series during three of the five years when three of their pitchers won 10 games during the first half of the season . <p> Philly fallout <p> Although Phillies left fielder Gregg Jefferies is only 31 years old , he knows he could be a casualty if the Phillies plan to rebuild with youth . <p> The Phillies have been trying to get rid of Jefferies for years , but no one would take him because his contract was so outrageous and his production was so underwhelming . <p> He 's hitting .314 this season , but that still wo n't be enough to convince the Phillies to pick up the $ 5 million option on his contract . Top outfield prospect Wendell Magee Jr . is waiting in the wings . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on this team , " Jefferies said . " But in my heart , I have a feeling I know what 's going to happen . I try to avoid that thought . They keep pumping the youth movement . And even though I 'm not 38 or 39 , it kind of puts me in a box . " <p> Jefferies could have trouble finding a job in the NL because he 's a player without a position . He began his career with the Mets as a second baseman but has played left field during most of his tenure with the Phillies . <p> Jefferies can butcher the outfield with the best , er , worst of them . <p> Belle sounds off <p> Albert Belle , who refused to participate in last year 's All-Star Game , had the audacity to take a shot at AL manager Mike Hargrove for not selecting him to the 1998 team . <p> " If Hargrove was his own man , I think I would have been picked , " Belle said . <p> The suggestion was that league officials urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the case . <p> " There was nobody in my ear about this , " said Hargrove , who managed Belle in Cleveland . " I made the decision based on the fact that Albert was picked last year and did n't participate in anything . <p> " He did n't take the team picture , he did n't take batting practice - nothing . I 'm not going to waste a spot with somebody who does n't want to play . It 's that plain and simple . "
