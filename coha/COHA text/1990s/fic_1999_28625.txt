" Once , " my mother said , " there was no true darkness . Even at night , the moon was as bright as the sun . The only difference was that the light was blue . You could see clearly for miles and miles and it was never cold . And this was called twilight . " " Why twi ? " I asked . " Because it rhymes with sky , " my mother said . " It 's a code word for blue . " Code blue was what they said when someone died , I remembered , and this , too , had to do with the sky . One day God called the bat to him and gave him a basket to carry to the moon . The basket was filled with darkness , but God did n't tell him what it was . Instead , he said , " Take this to the moon . I 'll explain everything when you return . " So the bat set off for the moon with the basket on his back . He flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hid behind a cloud . The bat grew tired and stopped for a rest . He put down the basket and went off to find something to eat . While he was gone , other animals came along . ( Dogs and wolves mostly , also a badger with a broken paw . ) These animals thought there might be food in the basket and pried the cover off , but inside there was only darkness , which they had never seen before . The dogs and wolves tried to pull it out and play with it , but it slipped away between their teeth and slithered off . Just then , the bat returned . He opened the basket and found it empty . The other animals disappeared into the night . The bat flew off to try to recapture the darkness . He could see it everywhere , but he could n't fit it back inside his basket , no matter how he tried . And that is why the bat sleepsall day and flies all night . He 's still trying to catch the dark . " Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wanted to know . I had asked my mother to tell me about Africa and instead she had told me about the bat . " It 's all about Africa , " my mother said , frowning . " Everything except the part about God . " When my mother was very young , she lived in Tanzania and studied birds . It was there that she met my father . He had come to Africa to set up a fishery and she had taught him some Swahili and that was that . " Before you were born , I met him , " my mother said . " Before you were even a gleam in my eye . " This made her laugh . I laughed too . I had seen a picture of my parents in Africa , standing on the beach , holding a giant silver fish between them . When they lived in Tanzania , my mother said , village boys would wait near the trees at dusk and scoop bats out of the sky with nets . In my notebook , I wrote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = mammal My mother spelled out each word for me and later I added " idealistic " to the list , which is what she said my father had been once . I kept the notebook because I thought that I might want to be a detective someday . I wrote down everything I heard , and when the pages started to fall out , I stuck them back inside with glue . I had an idea that someday someone would come to me with a mystery and I would open up the notebook and all the clues would already be there . My mother told me that another name for detective was P.I . and that this was the word for a number that no one could ever finish writing . I said , " What if you wrote all day and all night and never slept for a hundred years ? " " Even then , " my mother said , " you would n't be done . " About the bat , I wanted to know : Why was the darkness in a basket ? Why did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt his paw ? What do bats eat ? Where did the darkness run ? What happened to the dogs and wolves that started everything ? " Bats eat fruit and insects mostly , " my mother said . " The darkness ran everywhere at once . " " Do bats eat people ? " " No , " she said . " But there 's a kind in South America that drinks the blood of sleeping things . Sometimes they bite people without even waking them because their touch is as light as a kiss . " My mother turned off the light and closed the door . The room became its night self then , full of deep corners that swallowed up the dark . Shadows moved across the wall , chasing the lights of cars . I closed my eyes and tried to dream in another language . My mother knew five languages by heart and could dream in three . Her father had been a linguist and once she had wanted to be one too . Sometimes she spent all night translating what one person in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was so tired she could barely speak . That was why she slept all day and wandered around the house at night . In Africa , my mother said , there is a secret city where no one ever sleeps . If a traveler stumbles upon it and falls asleep , he will be buried alive before he wakes . The villagers have never seen sleep before and would think he had died in the night . If he woke up while he was being buried , they would think he was a demon and beat him to death . The only sign you have entered the sleepless city is a certain unceasing murmuring even in the dead of night . Otherwise , it looks like every other place . Travelers are advised to wander through each city , asking passersby , " Where can I sleep ? " because in the sleepless city no one knows the answer . * * * My mother had taught : me a little French . " What is your name ? " I knew and " Please , can you help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach me Swahili and she said , " You already know one word . Can you guess what it is ? " I had guessed " detective , " but this had been wrong . " Safari , " she said . " It 's an old Swahili word for travel . " This was the word for the shows my father liked to watch on TV . " Yes , " my mother said . " That 's exactly right . " Later I wrote " safari " in my notebook next to the word " Sophie , " the name of my mother 's other daughter , the one who died in Africa before I was born . Once I asked her if Sophie could speak Swahili before she died , but my mother said she had been too little to speak anything at all . Another time , my mother told me that when I was born every language in the world was in my head , waiting to take form . I could have spoken Swahili or Urdu or Cantonese , but now it was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked . " They just wasted away , " my mother explained , " like a leg you never walk on . " My mother kept a notebook too ; hers was black with shiny rings . I had torn a page from it and hidden it under my bed . Sometimes when I could n't sleep , I took the page out of its hiding place and read it : Zero order Betwixt trumpeter pebbly complication vigorous tipple careen obscure attractive consequence expedition unpunished prominence chest sweetly basin awake photographer ungrateful .

Prose text More attention has been paid to diet but mostly in relation to disease and to the growth of young children . A moth flew into the room and fluttered against the shade . I wondered if this might be the same moth that had tried to fly to a star . But that moth had died , I remembered , or maybe it was the moth who had stayed home and circled the street lamp . My mother had told me that story too and said the moral was that stars could not be trusted and moved farther away , the closer you came . " Poor moth , " I said again and again that day until my father put down the paper and asked me to stop . Later he explained that the nearest star was 93 million miles away and this made it unlikely that anyone , a person or a moth , would ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest star was , my father said , " The Sun , of course . " But my mother said that that was only one way to think of it and that in some places ( Africa , for instance ) people knew how to leave their bodies and fly up to the edge of the sky , where they hovered like birds . The trick , she said , was not to look down at your body in the bed , or you might lose your nerve and fall . I looked for the moth again , but it was gone . Outside my window , slow stars moved across the sky . I could feel myself falling asleep , into sleep , it seemed . This happened when the darkness in the corner pulled me to it like water to a drain . I closed my eyes and waited . Around me , the night buzzed like a fluorescent light .
