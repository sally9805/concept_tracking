After nearly a quarter of a century of marriage , Richie Meyers , my husband , told me to call him Rick . Then he started slicking back his hair with thirty-five-dollar-a-jar English pomade . Okay , I admit I was annoyed . But in all fairness , was n't Richie entitled to a life crisis ? He was just two years from fifty . His jaw was n't so much chiseled from granite anymore as sculpted from mashed potatoes . His hairline and his gums were receding at about the same rate . And when his shirt was off , he 'd eye his chest hair in disbelief , as if some practical joker had plunked a gray toupee between his pectorals . Well , I could empathize . At eleven months younger than Richie , I did n't exactly qualify as a spring chicken . Still , unless a man 's taste ran to prepubescent milkmaids with braids , I would probably be considered somewhere between attractive and downright pretty . Shiny dark hair . Clear skin . Even features . Hazel eyes with green specks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plus one hell of a set of eyelashes . And not a bad body either , although in the fight between gravity and me , gravity was winning ; no matter how many abdominal crunches I did , I would never again be tempted to include getting my panties ripped off in broad daylight as a detail of a sexual fantasy . Like Richie , I was n't so crazy about growing old , especially since I had at last come to appreciate the unlikelihood of immortality . A person who can laugh in the face of eternal nothingness is a schmuck . So my heart went out to him . And I made a sincere effort to call him Rick . But after all those years of " Richie , " I 'd slip up every so often -- like in bed . I cried out , " Oh , God ! Do n't stop , Rich . . . Rick . " But by then he was shriveling , and seconds later , it looked as if he 'd Scotch-taped a shrimp to his pubic area . The signs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . That 's how come I was surprised when , on the bright blue June morning after our silver anniversary party , which we 'd celebrated on what our real estate broker had called the Great Lawn behind our house , in a white tent festooned with creamy roses and thousands of twinkly white lights , Richie told me he was leaving me for his senior vice-president , for -- his voice softened , then melted -- Jessica . Jessica Stevenson had been one of the two hundred guests the night before . In fact , Richie had fox-trotted with her to a Cole Porter medley that had included " You 'd Be So Nice to Come Home To . " Yes , Jessica was a younger woman . But not obnoxiously so . Richie was n't one of those fiftyish guys who run off with twenty-two-year-old Lufthansa stewardesses . At thirty-eight , Jessica was a mere nine years younger than I. Unfortunately , she had luminous aquamarine eyes and was learning Japanese for the fun of it . At what turned out to be the final party of my marriage , I kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rosie ! As beautiful as the day we were married ! " He did n't . In the humid night air , the pleated , Grecian-style white silk gown that had caressed my curves in the fitting room at Bergdorf Goodman clung to my bosom and legs with crazed malice . Jessica , naturally , did not look as if she 'd wrapped herself in a wet sheet . No . She glowed in a gold lam off-the-shoulder bodysuit tucked into a transparent cream chiffon skirt that hung , petal-like , in soft panels ; her top was divided from her bottom by a four-inch-wide gold leather belt . It goes without saying she had a slender waist -- although to be perfectly candid , her bosom was nothing Richie would normally have written home about ; she was fairly flat , except for those overenthusiastic nipples men go crazy for , the kind that look like the erasers on number two pencils . I had actually blown her a kiss as I raced by , searching for the caterer to tell him that a guest , Richie 's banker 's girlfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jessica , in awesomely high-heeled gold sandals , was standing with a couple of the other Data Associates executives , laughing , squeezing a wedge of lime into her drink . She waved back with her usual energy : Rosie ! Hello ! With her gold bodysuit and the bronze highlights in her dark-gold hair , she looked shimmery , magical , almost like a mermaid . But that Richie would actually leave me for her ? Please ! He and I had a history . We 'd met in the late sixties , for God 's sake , when we were both teaching at Forest Hills High School in Queens . We had made a life together . A rich life -- long before all the money . We had children . So yes , I was surprised . Okay , stunned . Across our bedroom , Richie 's black-olive eyes were overflowing . He gulped noisy mouthfuls of air and was so choked up I could barely hear him . " I ca n't believe I 'm saying this , Rosie . " As he wiped his tears away with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manly act . " What gets me " his chest heaved --  " is that "  - -  he sobbed , unable to hold anything back --  " it sounds so damn trite . " " Please , Richie , tell me . " " For the first time in years , I feel truly alive . " The late-morning air was hot , sugary with honeysuckle , a reminder that lovely , sweaty summer sex was just weeks away . But , as the song goes , not for me . In spite of the season , I shivered and pulled the blanket tight around my shoulders . Sure , I was cold , but I suppose I also had the subconscious hope that all bundled up , lower lip quivering , I 'd be an irresistible package . I was n't . Richie was . With his combed-back steel-gray hair , his rich-man 's tan , his hand-tailored white slacks and crisp white shirt and white lizard loafers , he looked like an ex-husband who had outgrown his wife . But his face was wet . His tears were real . " Rosie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of a comeback . I just cried . He shifted his weight from one loafer to the other , and then back again . The confrontation was either horribly distressing or it was running longer than he 'd expected and he had a lunch date . " Richie , " I sobbed , " you 'll get over her ! " As fast as I could , I changed it to " Rick , please ! I love you so much ! " but by then it was much too late . That summer , I went through all the scorned-first-wife stages . Hysteria . Paralysis . Denial : Of course Richie will give up a worldly , successful , fertile , size-six financial whiz-bang for a suburban high school English teacher . Despair : spending my nights zonked on the Xanax I 'd conned my gynecologist into prescribing , regretting it was not general anesthesia . I was utterly alone . Husband gone . Kids grown and off on their own . And our beagle , Irving , died the first week in August . I wandered through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children 's warmth , Irving 's cold and loving nose . At least wandering was exercise . When Richie hit it big , he did not believe that less was more . More was more . One day we were in our Cape Cod , with its original , early sixties all-avocado kitchen , its off-the-track storm windows , its cockeyed basketball hoop over its one-car garage . The next , we were two and a half miles north , right on Long Island Sound in Great Gatsby country , in a Georgian-style house so stately it actually had a name . Gulls ' Haven . Admittedly , a nocturnal wanderer in a New York Shakespeare Festival T-shirt , pointlessly sexy black panties , and Pan Am socks left over from our last first-class flight to London ( before Richie got even richer and we started taking the Concorde ) given to rambles through a deserted house clutching a wad of damp Kleenex was n't the picture " Gulls ' Haven " ought to have evoked . But it was the truth . That 's how it was on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that night did n't seem any more or less ominous than any other . When we 'd moved , Richie had ditched the digital radio-alarm on his night table for a brass carriage clock , so I 'll never know the precise time I woke up or , more important , what wakened me . But it was around three-thirty . I realized I would n't get any more sleep because I was scared to take any more Xanax . My luck , the next pill could be the one to put me in what the doctors would diagnose as a persistent vegetative state . Richie , driven by guilt , would pay for the best custodial care , so I 'd spend the last three decades of my life cosmically desolate and unable to read , a prisoner in the solitary confinement of my own body . I wandered some more . When Richie had taken the hike that last week in June , he 'd made the twenty-six-mile trip west into Manhattan with just an overnight bag . How could a guy want to leave nearly his whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the closets full of his custom-tailored suits , touching the toes of his handmade shoes . I was able to get past them , and past his bathroom too , all rich green marble and chunky gold fixtures ; we 'd made love in his stall shower the first night we 'd moved in.
