NATION <P> Rocky the Flying Fight Fan <P> In a shocking and bizarre upset in Las Vegas , challenger Evander Holyfield took back the heavyweight boxing crown in a decision over previously undefeated champ Riddick Bowe . The fight was interrupted for 20 minutes during the seventh round when a parachutist came down into the outdoor ring at Caesars Palace . He landed on the ropes , bounced into the $800 ringside seats , was pummeled by irate spectators and wound up in the hospital in fair condition . Bowe 's pregnant wife Judy fainted and had to be taken away , but her husband , for understandable reasons , was not told . Holyfield became the third fighter ( after Floyd Patterson and Muhammad Ali ) to regain the title from the man he lost it to  --  and the first to do so after an unscheduled intermission . <P> Republicans Win <P> If last week is any harbinger , 1994 will be good to Republicans . In the New Jersey gubernatorial race , Christine Todd Whitman ousted Democrat James Florio , while New York City Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also won the Virginia statehouse , with George Allen scoring a victory over Mary Sue Terry . Top Democrats including President Clinton tried to downplay the significance of the results , attributing them to the vagaries of local politics . <P> Whither NAFTA ? <P> White House officials attempted to ensure that the unease caused by the Democrats ' Election Day losses did not hurt the North American Free Trade Agreement . Pollster Stan Greenberg was sent to Capitol Hill to convince Democrats that supporting NAFTA would not displease voters . In the meantime , Vice President Al Gore surprisingly challenged Ross Perot , NAFTA 's fiercest opponent , to a debate over its merits , and Perot , unsurprisingly , accepted . <P> The Packwood Saga <P> In a 94-to-6 vote , Senators supported the ethics committee 's effort to subpoena 8,400 pages of diaries as part of a sexual-misconduct investigation of Bob Packwood , the Oregon Republican . The five-term Senator refused to hand over the diaries , however , and the battle will now move into the federal courts . Democrat Robert Byrd of West Virginia savaged Packwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to resign . <P> Not So Bad After All <P> The Clinton Administration revised its revised number for how many Americans will pay more for health insurance . The figure was dropped from 40% of Americans to 30% . As explained to Congress by Budget Director Leon Panetta , the first figure counted only what people would pay in increased insurance premiums but did n't consider out-of-pocket costs such as co-payments , which are likely to decrease under the Clinton plan . <P> Ammo Control <P> Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York called for huge tax increases , ranging from 11% to 50% , on handgun bullets , to deter their use . He wants to tack his proposal onto the President 's health-care bill , saying he can not imagine the Senate Finance Committee , of which he is chairman , approving a health-reform bill without such a provision . <P> More Fire in California
