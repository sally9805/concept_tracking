<p> BILL OF RIGHTS <p> PROTECTION <p> Editor  --  We are in the midst of celebrating the 200th Anniversary of the Bill of Rights . Recently , to my shock and horror , I discovered how useless the document is . Right-wing reactionaries like J. Edgar Hoover , Ronald Reagan and William Rehnquist apparently never read it . <p> I recently was doing research at Stanford 's Jonsson Library of Government Documents . I discovered that the library holds 16 reels of microfilm from FBI documents on the Rev. Martin Luther King , Jr . The man was 39 when he died ; his public life spanned less than 15 years . <p> How much evil and criminality can one man do in 15 years to have 16 reels of microfilmed documents ? <p> I would venture a large bet that the KGB does not have as much information on Solzhenitsyn . <p> There are only two reels of microfilm on that other demonic threat to America , the football All-American , Rhodes Scholar and internationally acclaimed opera singer : Paul Robeson . White Americans need not feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John Steinbeck and Groucho Marx . <p> If this is the best the Warren Court could do with the Bill of Rights , then what does the next 20 to 30 years portend ? The Bill of Rights will be protected by the court 's solid reactionary , right-wing majority brought to us by Reagan and Bush . Will Big Brother be watching you ? <p> MICHAEL O. QUIGLEY <p> San Jose <p> LOOK FOR A MARKET <p> Editor  --  A lot has been said recently about opening up Japanese markets to American goods , especially to automobile manufacturers . Well , that is well and good I guess but I ask , who in their right mind would want to buy our inferior products ? Also , many American cars are too big for Japanese highways . <p> If this country would produce better products there might be some hope for greater sales at home and abroad . First we must make American industry more efficient . We must also educate our people better , and this includes keeping our young people in school until they at least complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so rampant in our society . Until we address those issues we will never produce better products and until we produce better products neither the Japanese nor anyone else will buy our goods . <p> Perhaps we should turn our attention to Russia and the other independent states as well as Eastern Europe . Certainly our products are in need there and they may be better than what is presently manufactured there . Let us stop this Japan bashing and do what they do . That is , look for a market in need and sell , sell , sell . <p> IRVING WALDORF <p> Oakland <p> BUSH 'S TAX LOOPHOLES <p> Editor  --  Who says George Bush has no domestic policy ? Like almost every other rich American , our president pays less income tax than most middle-class taxpayers . Although Bush lived and worked in Washington all through the 1980s and vacationed at the $ 2.2 million home he owns in Maine , his legal residence is a rented three-room apartment in Texas that he and Barbara " live " in for about five days a year . Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of Money magazine reports that President Bush , who made $ 452,732 in 1990  --  $ 200,000 as president and the rest through investments , paid 29.5 percent of that in income tax . The typical American family , making $ 52,011 a year , pays 37.7 percent taxes . <p> How can we expect Bush and other wealthy politicians to stabilize the economy when their loophole-oriented mentality leads even our president to pay less than his fair share ? <p> DAVID J. HORRIGAN <p> Davis <p> WHAT A CONCLUSION <p> Editor  --  I was surprised to read ( Chronicle , December 28 ) that the House Select Committee on Assassinations , which looked into the murder of John F. Kennedy , determined that Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy and that neither the Soviet Union ( remember them ? ) , Cuba nor any U.S. government agency was involved in the assassination . Period . End of Story . <p> Wow ! <p> Perhaps you have forgotten the most important conclusion of the committee ? It is a matter of public record that the committee determined that there probably was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States by blowing his head off . <p> The omission of this conclusion is truly a highly selective reading of the facts at best . Why was this left out of the story ! ? <p> E. SWIPES <p> Kensington <p> ON TERM LIMITS <p> Editor  --  In regard to your recent article , " Legislative Counsel Says S.F. Term Limits are Illegal " ( Chronicle , January 9 ) , the following comments should be considered and understood . <p> An overwhelming 64 percent of San Francisco voters approved of term limitation . The only visible opposition to term limits came from Art Agnos , Jim Gonzalez , Louise Renne , Terence Hallinan , as well as several state legislators and other incumbent politicians . <p> Several months of research were made in regard to the legislation that I authored . Some of the best legal minds available provided analysis on the verbiage and intent of the legislation as well as the applicability to federal , state and local law , including the City Charter . The legislation is fair , legal and beneficial to the citizens . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have pressured the legislative counsel into making public an opinion that carries no substance and merely seeks to abuse the rights of the San Francisco voters who supported the law through a landslide victory . <p> The nonpartisan coalition of citizens that sponsored the legislation appreciates and applauds the efforts of state Senator Kopp . He not only supports the good government term limitation law , but also continues to oppose the political hanky- panky so unfortunately prevalent in the political arena . <p> The coalition will continue to represent good government and oppose the efforts of those incumbents who seek to increase their power base while failing to represent the needs of every citizen . We value public opinion and salute your continued support . <p> RICHARD BODISCO , chairman <p> San Franciscans for <p> Reasonable Reform <p> N.Y . SLANT <p> Editor  --  The New York Post , circulation over 600,000 , ran an editorial titled , " San Francisco 's Rightward Shift . " This reader found it somewhat slanted , and wrote a letter which was printed in the December 30 edition , under the heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know the type of campaign Mr. Agnos and Mr. Jordan engaged in . I am in a fog ( excuse the pun ) as to who Mr. Jordan is ! My guess , he was one of two police chiefs in Dianne Feinstein 's administration . I just hate to see the people and the city of San Francisco portrayed in a negative light . ( You will not believe how the N.Y . media treats the 49ers , but that 's a different story . ) <p> Best wishes to the new administration , and I know you will carry on in the tradition to make us all proud of our Bay Area history and culture . <p> RICHARD STIEGLITZ <p> Rego Park , N.Y . <p> FASCINATING READING <p> Editor  --  The Friday , December 27 edition of The Chronicle was a fascinating experience in reading . First , in the Bay Area section , I saw that Queer Nation was indefinitely closing due to " . . . charges of racism . " ( What ! ?  --  Not from these enemies of prejudice ! ) " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These activists are the vanguard of a just society ! ) Then , in letters to the editor , Allen Jeffries tells straight people to leave San Francisco if they want to be safe . What ? ! And leave this bastion of tolerance ? <p> PAUL SELLMAN <p> San Francisco <p> UNREPRESENTATIVE <p> Editor  --  It was with a great deal of interest that I read the coments ( Chronicle , January 7 ) from Jean Harris , Mayor Frank Jordan 's new staff person representing the lesbian/gay community . One can only wonder if Ms. Harris has any common sense at all in attacking her boss publicly before she even takes office . But the thing that troubles me most is that Mayor Jordan seems to think Ms. Harris represents the lesbian community . As a lesbian , this offends me . Everything I 've ever read about Jean Harris has shown that she is obnoxious , confrontational , immature and has her own agenda . This woman does not represent the overwhelming majority of lesbians or anyone else . Look how she destroyed the Harvey Milk Lesbian/Gay Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our community , it 's a sad day for all of us . <p> LAURA GALA <p> San Francisco <p> PALMS AND ARCHES <p> Editor  --  Line The Embarcadero with palm trees ? Splendid idea ! The Port Commission should go all the way with this , however . Full-size plastic palm trees would be just as attractive and even hardier than canariensis , and would never need to be watered . Additional landscaping should also include extensive astroturfing so that tourists need never get their white shoes muddy . <p> While they 're at it , they should erect giant arches over The Embarcadero emblazoned with the slogan , " This Used to Be a Port , " so everyone understands exactly what the commissioners are trying to accomplish . Of course , the arches should be large and well-lit so they may be easily seen across the bay . <p> We need a few laughs over here . <p> JOHN TULLY <p> Oakland
