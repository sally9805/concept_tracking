<p> When Cleo Parker Robinson began her dance company 25 years ago , it was an act of faith . <p> She had just graduated from Colorado Women 's College , where she studied with Rita Berger . But starting Sunday she 's celebrating the 25th anniversary of her company . She was looking , when we spoke last week . " It 's madness , more madness , the most madness we 've had in a long time , " she said . <p> The whole week will be a series of celebrations of , by and for her company , the Cleo Parker Robinson Dance Ensemble . <p> What happened between that first , tentative performance and the dynamic , star-studded group of today ? <p> For one thing , there was a lot of experimentation and a lot of growth . I saw a lot of it . <p> The first performance I saw of Robinson 's was when she received a grant from Model Cities to promote dance among disadvantaged youth . As a company , this was as oddly matched a group as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members except Robinson had come to dance relatively late , and they were tentative and hesitant . <p> It was hard to commit to the idea of a grand movement when you 'd never had to do it before and had n't had the practice of years in a studio . Robinson , however , tried always to make her company look good , and if they could n't quite dance the way she wanted , she 'd dazzle the audience with theatrical effects . There were film , props and some unusual costumes . <p> From the outset , however , Robinson had decided several things . " Even as early as 1972 , " she said , " we had a parallel track , as we call it now . We were always concerned about the dance as a form and finding our form . But also ( we were concerned ) about our community . Our community was not only the black community and Denver . We began to realize it was a greater community . <p> " Finding the voice and preserving tradition - and finding out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . We wanted also to find our own form so we could speak a language that had n't been spoken yet . We 're still in the process , just in another place of the process . " <p> During the early years , it seemed as though the Robinson ensemble veered from one form of dance to another . There was ethnic dancing and modern dancing and a fey mix as well . One thing was certain : They were n't doing ballet . <p> As Robinson said , they were searching for their voice , their expression . The company went to Africa and learned authentic African dances , but worried that this did n't express quite what the company was about . ( But elements can still be found in Robinson 's choreography and that of guest choreographers . ) <p> Together with searching for an authentic voice , the company was for many of its first 25 years scrambling for a home . Model Cities provided a decrepit theater . The group also actively sought other venues . <p> The first Bonfils Theatre ( now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge all performers need : experience . " We were able to create through the musical theater . Henry ( Lowenstein , then director of the theater ) was extraordinary in pushing us . It was n't always comfortable , " Robinson recalled . <p> Another home was her alma mater , Colorado Women 's College , where her father was manager of the Houston Fine Arts Center . " The Arvada Center was a home , " Robinson said . " We 'd experiment . They 'd always say they wanted a new work . " <p> Some of the new works were controversial . There was the Angela Davis piece called " Run , Sister , Run " and " Blood River , " which chronicled the African-American experience . <p> It was at the Arvada Center that Robinson scored a major coup : enticing Maya Angelou to Denver for dance and poetry . " It was a marathon concert , " Robinson said . " I looked at the tape not too long ago and was amazed . People sat through three hours . But it was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then we realized she was a dancer - she 'd danced with Alvin Ailey . " <p> Of course there were down moments . Losing a home . Losing a studio . Picking up and moving on . <p> " We have come through a lot , " Robinson said . " But let 's not forget . Let 's value it . There 's still so much that has to take place . " <p> The company now has a permanent home , the former Shorter AME Church at East 20th Avenue , Washington Street and Park Avenue West . The building houses studios , theater and offices . <p> If anything , Robinson celebrates every moment of the company 's 25 years , maybe not every moment with the same enthusiasm , but every moment nonetheless . <p> " There 's really something to rejoice about , " she said . " And it happened here , not in Chicago or Los Angeles . Here . In Five Points . We have stayed in a 10-block radius of Five Points . When Model Cities ended , we really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was fearful , we then had to go to another level . <p> " We shared space , if you can believe this , with the Denver Civic Ballet . Milenko Banovitch said , ' Until you have your own home ' We did the ' Nutcracker ' together . I remember we toured it to Vail . Of course , I do n't do the ' Nutcracker ' now ! " ( She choreographed a holiday tradition dance called " Granny Dances to a Holiday Drum " that looks at many traditions centered on the winter solstice . ) <p> Plugging along , Robinson began to mold an ensemble that made people sit up and pay attention . With that base , she could begin to invite guest choreographers to set work for her company . The company was n't always ready . Some of the guests were polite but firm : " No , " they said . " But maybe when your company has developed a little more . " <p> And the company did improve . Rod Rodgers and Eleo Pomare did works for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular basis . <p> Today ? " We have the largest repository of Donald McKayle 's work of any company in the world - and he 's worked with the Israeli Ballet , Cincinnati Ballet , lots of companies , " Robinson said . <p> The ensemble was also chosen to become a living archive for works by Katherine Dunham and was noted in a recent article in The New York Times for " Barrelhouse Blues , " which was performed at the American Dance Festival this summer . The Robinson Dance Ensemble also has done some works by Helen Tamiris , the pioneer of socially activist dance . <p> Robinson is proud that some of her former dancers will return for the gala week . " I feel like a university , " she confessed , " with alumni and trying to find them sometimes . " Also on hand will be Angelou - " On the screen only ; she 's very busy , too " - and co-founder of the company Schyleen Qualls . Also Gordon Parks , Dunham and McKayle . <p> " It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a three-year initiative . It really will take us into the next 25 years .
