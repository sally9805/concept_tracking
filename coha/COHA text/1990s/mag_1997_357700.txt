BARRY 'S BACK IN PRIME TIME <P> First he lost a bidding war for Paramount Communications in 1994 . Then his effort to take over CBS collapsed at the last minute . But last week Barry Diller , who masterminded the rise of the Fox Network for Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp . a decade ago , was no longer a mogul-without-portfolio . Diller , who heads up the unglamorous HSN , whose holdings include the Home Shopping Network and a stake in Ticketmaster , struck a deal for nearly $4.1 billion with Seagram Co. that lays a foundation for his own entertainment empire . Diller , 55 , will pay Seagram $1.2 billion in cash plus HSN stock for Seagram 's USA and Sci-Fi cable channels and most of its Universal TV operations . Among them : the acclaimed cops-and-lawyers show Law and Order and schlock hit Xena : Warrior Princess . <P> The new enterprise , called USA Networks , puts Diller back in prime time with a long-sought chance to compete with the major broadcast networks . And it brings Seagram new outlets for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also enables Seagram CEO Edgar Bronfman Jr . to team up with pal Diller , one of TV 's shrewdest programmers . <P> ITT FINALLY SLAMS THE DOOR ON HILTON <P> Looks like checkout time for Hilton Corp . ' s Stephen Bollenbach . After an entertaining nine-month battle , replete with name calling , to buy ITT and its prized Sheraton properties and Caesars hotels and casinos , Bollenbach came up empty . But the escape from Hilton cost ITT its independence . Fearful that ITT shareholders would accept Hilton 's $70 a share offer in two weeks , ITT chairman Rand Araskog pulled a rabbit out of a hat by agreeing to sell ITT to Starwood Lodging for $82 a share . That 's 17% more than Hilton 's " final " offer . <P> Starwood Lodging , a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) based in Phoenix , Ariz. , was able to outbid Hilton because of a loophole in the tax laws that jacks up a reit 's market value . If ITT stockholders approve the deal , the new combination would become the largest lodging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries and total annual revenues of more than $10 billion . As for Araskog , 65 , under the plan he will step down next year and get a seat on Starwood 's board plus a consolation prize : a $55 million severance package that was designed as part of ITT 's " defense " against a takeover . <P> So it 's over , right ? Well ... there is an enticing story line that could have the wily Araskog pulling off one last masterly stroke . Once ITT shareholders formally reject Hilton 's bid next month , the ITT chairman could cancel the Starwood deal and continue his 18-year reign over the company . No one ever played Monopoly like this . <P> AT &T; FOLDS ITS UNIVERSAL CARD <P> On the same day that AT &T; replaced faltering CEO Robert Allen with former Hughes Electronics boss C. Michael Armstrong , the phone giant put its staggering $14 billion Universal Card business on the block . AT &T; terrorized the credit-card industry and started a trend by introducing , with spectacular results , the no-fee-for-life Universal Card in 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent on interest charges that many customers refused to rack up . According to Robert McKinley , president of RAM Research , holders of as many as 60% of AT &T's; 18 million Universal Cards are " convenience users " who pay off their bills each month . The industry average is 30% to 40%.
