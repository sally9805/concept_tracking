<p> PEOPLE do like cities . <p> Though often derided as centers of crime , pollution , homelessness , and crumbling infrastructure , cities still rate high as places to live . By United Nations estimates , the majority of citizens , including 60 percent of the world 's poor , will be urban dwellers by the year 2000 . Many will live in cities of unprecedented size . Twenty-three cities - most of them in developing nations - will have populations of more than 10 million each . <p> Trying to provide even the most basic services for so many people is a major challenge for city governments . The need is to find creative ways to make large cities work better . That 's why Janice Perlman , a political scientist with New York University 's Urban Research Center , has been at work for the last few years building a network of citizen teams in 14 of the world 's largest cities . The aim is to identify and share innovative ideas that work . <p> " We know there are lots of failures - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories in solving these huge urban problems , " says Dr. Perlman , the network 's executive director . " We 're trying to be the voice of the alternative city ... to find approaches that cost less and reach people 's needs more efficiently . " <p> Launched with seed money from a few United States foundations and international assistance groups , this Mega-Cities Project operates on the theory that cities in developing and industrialized nations have much to learn from each other . <p> " These cities may have different histories and different levels of economic development , but when it comes to garbage or conserving water or building a transportation system to get people to and from work , the problems are very similar , " Perlman says . <p> As she sees it , every third-world city has first-world components , such as high technology and high finance at the center , while every first-world city shares many third-world problems , such as poverty and malnutrition . <p> For many third-world cities , the economic and environmental costs of trying to provide all citizens with traditional services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be to skip a generation of technology . Rather than trying to replicate the toilets of the industrialized world that use 15 liters ( about 4 gallons ) of water per flush , for instance , cities in developing nations may do better in terms of cost and water conservation by adopting newer models that use only 1.5 liters of water per flush . <p> In some cases introducing more cost-effective and creative ideas may require government recognition of and cooperation with the informal economic sector that plays such a prominent role in many third-world cities . In Jakarta , for instance , many street vendors have been able to earn a better living and gain a more permanent location with government loans that let them set up sales stalls in city bazaars . <p> The initial focus of the Mega-Cities Project teams , which include community , business , and government leaders , has been the environment . Perlman says the thrust is intended partly to counter the negative image of cities as polluters . The emphasis is also meant to coincide with the UN environmental conference to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , Mega-Cities teams have identified from 20 to 200 successful innovations in each city . These range from the grand to the simple . Project standards stipulate that each must be economically viable , ecologically sound , socially just , and involve broad community participation . <p> One ambitious idea now being looked at by New York City , according to Perlman , is Tokyo 's Dream Island , an area in the harbor in which garbage is containerized and used as landfill . It is capped by a recreational area that includes beaches and botanical gardens heated by methane gas . <p> Other ideas up for global consideration include a for-profit recycling center here in the Bronx that buys trash from the public and employs local residents , the Green Belt Movement in Nairobi , Kenya , that involves the massive planting of trees and preservation of park space , and mobil elementary school and day-care-center facilities that follow construction workers to various sites in New Delhi . One simple idea is an antilitter program in Bangkok . Children are urged to help by a cartoon face on litter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are watching you . " <p> Often it is not clear where a good idea really gets its start . Rio is trying to reduce car congestion and make streets more friendly to pedestrians and bikes by integrating bike paths with public transit and ferry lines . The plan is one of many under consideration by New York City officials looking for ways to comply with the Clean Air Act . Brazilians say they got the idea from London . " Sometimes these ideas bounce back and forth with value added each time , " Perlman says . <p> Most technological and scientific advances of the last century have evolved through the private sector and have largely benefitted consumers and the military establishment , Perlman says . It is the public sector and cities in particular , she says , which badly need this new kind of experimental laboratory network . <p> " It 's by no means easy for cities to learn from each other - there 's no natural channel , " agrees Lisa Peattie , a professor of urban studies and planning at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinvent the wheel all the time . " <p> Perlman says she does not expect many Mega-Cities ideas to be transferred wholesale . More likely , she says , parts of innovations will be plucked and adapted to fit varying needs . Sometimes understanding the techniques used to win public or official support for an idea can be the most important part . <p> " Often the big secret is not the technology - it 's making the idea happen , " she says . <p> Analyzing the impact of controversial ideas is part of the lesson . Cities concerned , for instance , that proposals to reduce downtown traffic may adversely affect local businesses can learn much from the cumulative experience of Copenhagen , Buenos Aires , and Sao Paulo , Brazil , with such experiments . <p> This political aspect is one reason Perlman wanted a representative grass-roots team in each city rather than just a group of city officials . She recruited and trained each team coordinator . All have considerable empathy , she says , for " bottom-up " solutions and neighborhood problem-solving . <p> Perlman travels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time fund-raising . She works out of a small townhouse office at New York University that overlooks Washington Square in Manhattan . <p> Placards listing the names of all 14 cities in the project - Bangkok , Bombay , Buenos Aires , Jakarta , London , Los Angeles , Mexico City , Moscow , Nairobi , New Delhi , New York , Rio de Janeiro , Sao Paulo , and Tokyo - circle the walls , flanked by charts and maps . <p> Beijing , also a member , is currently on hold for political reasons . If funding increases enough , the project would welcome all 23 megacities ( see chart on Page 12 ) as members . <p> In Perlman 's view , cities , which account for the overwhelming share of the gross national product in every nation , deserve far more attention and support than they now get . Many people mistakenly look on cities , she says , as " parasites " that eat up most national resources . In fact , she says most development and international assistance organizations have only recently begun to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who heads the Urban Development Division of the World Bank , agrees . Noting that the World Bank has focused on cities and urban policy per se for less than 20 years , he says the bank still lends only five percent of its annual total , or about $1.5 billion , for urban projects . He says he finds it " startling " to realize that - at the moment when many cities are facing " dramatic " population increases - urban research around the world is in decline . He says the subject was on the rise in the 1960s but that most urban research centers now have much smaller staffs and more limited agendas . <p> A major redefinition of how cities ought to work and how services in the 21st century can best be supplied is " desperately needed , " says David Ramage , president of the McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago and a member of the Mega-Cities advisory board . " We 're at a point in terms of the technology of human settlement that we have run out of capacity to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Perlman says the unprecedented scale of the world 's largest cities is such that the concept of providing services from a central base needs to be rethought . " We 're at a level of urban opportunity and crisis that really demands a new approach , " she says . She clearly hopes that the Mega-Cities Project will provide it .
