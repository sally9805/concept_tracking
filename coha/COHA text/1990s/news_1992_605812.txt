<p> WHEN YOU SEE Dr. Marc Doctors in the daytime you may see your dentist , drill in hand . But when his colleagues in the Hockey North America league see him at night , they see a guy whose business is to extract their puck , not their bicuspids . <p> Then there 's photographer Ann Gassenheimer , whose own official portrait would be with Nikon in hand , stalking visiting dignitaries and political Washington . But her not-so-official pose would be in safari gear , trekking across the African continent , re-creating Henry M. Stanley 's historic expeditions . <p> Baltimore necktie manufacturer Harvey Schreter and his wife , Phyllis , cruise the jungles of Ecuador and the bush of Kenya , looking for adventure and lost civilizations . How many other soft-goods guys do you know who got the recipe for shrunken heads from the tribal shaman who wrote it ? <p> These are people for whom one life is not enough  --  with bountiful energy and talent enough to command parallel lives . If life 's a stage , they get more than their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , occupations and obsessions , day jobs and night diversions with equal gusto , seriousness , devotion and skill . They are your classic overachievers  --  double-majored , as it were , in life  --  wearing so many hats , it 's a wonder they have enough heads . <p> Now , these overdoers might not warrant a second glance during working hours in their ordinary guises , but they 'd get your attention after hours as race-car drivers or jazz saxophonists . And maybe that 's partly why they do it . Says Carol Melamed , a lawyer at The Washington Post and off-hours tap-dancer , " No one stands up and applauds when I write a brief . " <p> In Washington , overdoers are not anomalies . Scores of people , it seems , are leading double lives , many more than could be included here . At least eight of them are accounted for in Brock &; the Rockets , an eight-person a cappella group led by MCI marketing whiz Brock Holmes , with his fellow doo-woppers  --  by day , newspaper reporters , high school guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full-time mailman and jazz giant ( tenor sax ) ; Steven Silverman , senior attorney in the Office of the General Counsel at the Environmental Protection Agency and performing concert pianist ( complete with Carnegie Hall debut ) ; Stephen M. Weissman , psychoanalyst and biographer ( Samuel Taylor Coleridge , Charlie Chaplin ) ; and Marcia Halliday , electrical engineer for GTE and serious speleologist . <p> These moonlighters seem to revel in their split personalities . One day they might feel more like cardiologists , the next rising country-western stars , but they like it that way , because one pursuit nurtures the other in tangible and intangible ways . They know what pays the bills , but get to have the double satisfaction of playing it straight by day and playing tenor sax by night . <p> Are they different personalities in their double lives ? In their heart of hearts , which would they rather be pursuing ? Would they ever quit their day jobs ? And when , pray tell , do they have time to do the laundry ? ONE FROM THE HEART <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " gets to do his laundry between promotional tours around the country for his new Capitol Nashville album , " Tourist in Paradise , " and his steady gig at the coronary care unit of Mount Vernon Hospital in Alexandria . The road life is a grueling one  --  a different city every day , countless personal appearances , parties for DJs , and interviews on local radio and TV . <p> " Sure , these tours are exhausting , " says Francis , 45 , " but it 's no harder than tending critically ill patients all night  --  or getting up at 2 , 3 or 4 in the morning to make rounds . " <p> Conveniently , his profession lends itself to some clever marketing , which Francis seems to enjoy . " They sent out my single , ' Love Light , ' to the DJs in a toy doctor 's satchel , and had me write a prescription to ' Please play three times a day , ' " he laughs . <p> When asked why the record company did n't exploit the album 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he admits it 's a good bet to be his next single . His interviewers , too , have a field day with bad puns , and people are always offering to write him silly songs ( " Do n't Bypass My Love " is one example ) . But who can help it : After all , in what other two professions does the word " heart " occur so often ? <p> Fashioning successful careers in both professions no doubt requires a lot of , well , patience . But " music has just always been a part of my life , " says Francis . " I 've been singing since I was 8 and worked at roadside cafes and Holiday Inns through grad school and medical school for $ 25 a night . " <p> There was never any question of Francis abandoning his practice to work on his music full time  --  he worked too long and hard for his success as a doctor . " I came from a poor family in Cajun country in Louisiana , " explains Francis , " and becoming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude that if my singing happens , it happens  --  and I could still use my music , too , to make people feel good . " <p> A career as a country singer has required the same tenacity and hard work it took to become a doctor : Making it in the music business is neither an overnight prospect nor a sure thing , especially for a black country singer . Ironically , Francis was " discovered " in the hospital : " A patient 's brother who was in the music business heard I sang and asked to hear a tape . " <p> Before long Francis , who had recorded three albums on his own , had a recording contract with Playback Records , a popular music video ( " Love Light " ) and eventually a deal with Capitol Nashville , which will release a new album in March . <p> " I like songs that tell stories and have positive messages , not the ' cheatin ' and drinkin ' , tears in my beer ' sort you hear a lot , " says Francis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloom or in decline . Country music has the audience 's ear , Francis believes , the way folk music did in the ' 60s . <p> " Artists should be talking about social issues in the songs we sing , not ignoring them , " he asserts . <p> And he 'd be the first to say that music is good medicine . So for now , Francis spends the weekends on call ; the first thing Monday morning , he 's on a plane to Nashville where for a few days he 's Cleve again , the heartthrob and rising country star . THE JOY OF SAX <p> David Levy , president and director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art , downplays his double lives in art and music  --  including a tour to Japan this month as a baritone and alto saxophonist with New York jazzmen Chico Hamilton ( drums ) and Donald Byrd ( trumpet ) . <p> " All jazz musicians have other lives  --  they have to pay the bills , " Levy says <p> Occasionally his two lives intersect , as when he performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levy has been working as a musician since he was a kid , which he owes to adolescent rebellion ( both parents were painters ) and a bad accident . " I broke my neck and back and was in an upper-body cast . While I was recuperating I taught myself to play my cousin 's clarinet . " <p> During high school he played drums ( he also plays the viola , piano , harpsichord and flute ) in a band in New York City on weekends . " I also sat in at jazz jam sessions  --  and got a lot of egg on my face , the only way to learn to play jazz , " says Levy . <p> While head of the Parsons School of Design and later the chancellor of the New School for Social Research in New York , he formed the East 13th Street Band with his artist friend Larry Rivers , touring around the country and cutting records . <p> As for his musical ambitions , Levy knows what pays the bills . " Music is a great personal pleasure to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musician I would have been . " <p> And since " jazz happens at night , " the two do n't conflict . Besides , he says , " playing jazz is not a question of time , but a question of energy . " <p> What 's most satisfying , according to Levy , is " functioning as a professional with people who are tops in their field  --  a far different bunch of cats " than inhabit the world of an arts administrator . DOUBLE EXPOSURE <p> Photographer Ann Gassenheimer may spend most of her time shooting subjects , but she 's been shot at almost as much , it seems , in her work for the Reuters Bureau in Jerusalem . A lot of her professional life sounds more like adventure than work , but she believes ultimately that " no matter what you undertake , you 've got to be willing to take some risks . " <p> How else can you explain the Washingtonian 's nonchalance about literally walking her toenails off on a re-creation , in 1990 , of Stanley 's famous pursuit of Livingstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endured such hardships as swarms of stinging tsetse flies undeterred by clothing and insect repellent ; insufficient food , water and medicine ; encounters with angry Tanzanians toting assault rifles ; and lethal green mamba snakes and pythons . <p> During the two-month Stanley expedition , organized by local adventurer Jim Owens , Gassenheimer says , " We were all pushed to our limits , walking 12-hour days , carrying 30-pound packs through tough terrain  --  and were constantly in a lot of pain . " <p> This was no glamour trip : " But it was all worth it , to meet people who had never seen a white man before , and to have the chance to photograph them . " <p> Gassenheimer had signed on for the expedition partly because she needed a change from the job she had talked her way into with Reuters in Jerusalem 2 1/2 years before . Her introduction to photojournalism was covering religious demonstrations , which in Jerusalem can get a little dangerous . She had more than a few narrow escapes , including some tussles with Israeli soldiers over film . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed , " she explains gleefully , dismissing the resulting dangers . " Things just get hairy over there sometimes . " <p> Her next expedition in May 1993 , under Owens again , will be even more ambitious  --  this time re-creating Stanley 's second African expedition to verify the source of the Nile by walking across the entire continent  --  from Zanzibar in the east to Banana Point in the west  --  in eight to 10 months . But while the expedition is being organized , she is headed off to work on a documentary film on folk artists in America 's Deep South . SUNDAY DRIVER <p> " Is this about the spotted owl ? " Don Knowles 's secretary at the Department of the Interior wants to know . <p> Visions of Paul Newman dancing in our heads , we explain that we 're just as interested in his other life off-hours as a race car driver . Not that we do n't give a hoot about his current effort to protect the owl and save jobs for the Northwest timber industry , simultaneously , as Interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowles , 44 , negotiates the fast breaks and mean curves of politics , and on weekends he shifts gears and heads off to the other endurance races  --  on the Sports Car Club of America and International Motor Sports Association circuit . And he 's driven : Last year he and his Morrison Motorsports team broke a world record set in 1940 , driving a ZR-1 Chevy Corvette an average of 175 mph for 24 hours in Fort Stockton , Tex . <p> " That would be more than three times the national speed limit , " he laughs . " But the real challenge on that weekend was trying to make the 109-mile drive to the airport in an hour . " <p> Knowles has been racing since 1972  --  completing more than two dozen 24-hour races , winning 13 of them . A former staffer for the Senate Appropriations and Transportation committees , he says he brings the same qualities to his job at Interior as he does to his driving . <p> " What I like about racing , " he explains , " is the combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge  --  knowing that if you move a tenth of a second too soon , you can hit the wall . " <p> Knowles says he 's always flirting with limits : " How far can I go ? How late can I wait ? How soon can I start ? " <p> It 's also just his avocation , he says . " What I make racing anually barely covers one year 's tuition for my daughter 's college . " <p> But the Springfield resident often ponders the connection between his two lives . Where does he have the most control  --  in the car or on the Hill ? With the human factor " a lot harder to predict than the mechanical , " Knowles would probably agree that , on the Hill , it 's sometimes unsafe at any speed . <p> And though he has " rolled his car into a ball , ripped the tires and wheels off , and slammed into a wall , " Knowles avers he has never had any close calls . If those are n't close calls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's safe to say that few other tie salesmen have lived among headhunters  --  where a necktie could not be more redundant  --  or had their exploits immortalized in the National Anthropological Archives at the National Museum of Natural History . Few have A. Harvey Schreter 's head for business , the success of which gave him the means to travel and enabled him to tie in his interest in anthropology , documenting vanishing cultures . <p> Schreter , who speaks of himself in the third person , addressed the Explorers Club about his and wife Phyllis 's exploits among the Jivaro ( a k a the Shuar Indians ) in Ecuador 's Amazon headwaters . He describes the weekend program with obvious pride : " Sir Edmund Hillary spoke one night , the guy who found the Titanic the next , and Harvey spoke on Monday . " <p> The Schreters , married 50 years , have been giving monthly lectures since 1971 , when they began their travels . They have been to at least 90 countries together : " We were the first tourist group that went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afghanistan before the military coup and in Iran just before the shah was thrown out , " says Harvey . " Our aim has always been to leave the cultures we visit undisturbed . " <p> And their research materials are donated to museums . <p> Recently retired , but still a consultant in the business , Harvey 's niche in tie design was incorporating motifs and symbols from different cultures into wearable art that was sold in museum shops , including Egyptian and Chinese patterns , and the recent " Save the Elephant " tie to benefit the Kenya Wildlife Service . <p> " Our Ecuador trip , as the guests of missionaries , took us four years to arrange , " explains Harvey . " A previous group of ornithologists fared pretty badly in the same territory  --  driven out of the jungle by the natives , who thought they were searching for gold . " <p> The Schreters flew into the remote area over the Cutucu Mountain Range , near the border with Peru , on a plane fashioned from a kit by the missionary 's son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remote Sacred Falls ( a harrowing 10-hour hike up the sides of a canyon ) , a mystical spot where the young warriors go to become headhunters . <p> During their stay Harvey fell , spraining his back , and was treated by the tribal shaman , who made three " hut calls " to expell the evil spirits . " This was a great chance to do some real research , and we had Phyllis tape-record the proceedings , " he says . <p> The session was a wild scene with the shaman first taking hallucinogens , then sucking the poison out of Harvey 's body , alternately waving a baton over him and shrieking and chanting . <p> Did this worry the patient ? " During the cure , " Phyllis says , " Harvey fell asleep . " DANCES WITH BRIEFS <p> Now some might maintain that lawyers are all tap-dancers by definition , but when Carol Melamed , director of government affairs and associate counsel for The Washington Post , puts aside her legal briefs for the fast shuffle , she does it for the applause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her job at The Post . " I was feeling pretty light on my feet after the baby was born , " she jokes , " so I just signed up for beginning tap . " <p> She 'd hated ballet as a kid , but says she took to jazz tap like a lawyer to depositions , going to lessons first once , then twice , a week , and eventually joining an amateur performing company , part of the National Tap Ensemble , and appearing with them at the Kennedy Center and the French Embassy . <p> " I would never say that dancing is anything but a lark , " stresses Melamed , " but what I enjoy most is the wonderful illusion of feeling like a dancer . " She relishes , too , the contrast between her day job and her hoofing , which is " totally nonanalytical and nonverbal , involving a whole different set of mental processes and skills . " <p> Tap , she says , has exposed her to the previously ignored creative , artistic life . And though performing terrifies her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you draft a letter , 3,000 people do n't stand on their feet and yelp . And the good thing about tap is you can just go behind your desk for 10 minutes to get in a little practice . " <p> And does she ? <p> No comment . Once a lawyer . . . . SOUL ON ICE <p> If , as one hockey sage was overheard to postulate at a game recently , " half the hockey players in the world have probably had their teeth knocked out , " that must make it a dentist 's dream sport . But as a D.C. dentist with a busy practice who runs a dental HMO besides , Marc Doctors probably does n't need any more " goal mouths "  --  at least off the ice . <p> Though he claims that hockey is just a hobby , he describes turning into a completely different person on the ice  --  not the chairside charmer his patients know . " When I get out there , I literally forget everything but what I have to do to keep the puck out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily admits , is a pretty macho sport . " Any game where there is a lot of body contact between guys with sticks is bound to get a little aggressive , " laughs Doctors . In his amateur league , though , there is no checking allowed , and helmets and face masks are required . <p> Doctors , 45 , did n't learn to ice-skate until 10 years ago . " Then I saw an ad in the paper for the National Novice Hockey League that was forming . It read ' Learn to Skate  --  Just Show Up . ' So I did  --  along with 50 other guys . " <p> Soon he had all the equipment to be a player  --  including a full hockey uniform with his name on the back . They were assigned to teams and the " Star-Spangled Banner " was played at the beginning of each game . <p> " That was a real thrill , " remembers Doctors . " I felt like a kid again . But the first few games , with guys still learning to skate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puck  --  and when one guy would fall , the whole team would fall . " <p> And how long did the transformation from slapstick to slap shot take ? " After a few months it started to look vaguely like hockey , " he says . <p> And sometime after the first season  --  he is in his 11th currently , now a defenseman in the Hockey North America League  --  Doctors became known as the penalty leader . His team went to an international amateur championship with Canadian teams . And they got killed  --  the Canadians , says Doctors , really know how to drill those shots . <p> Barbara Ann Curcio last wrote for Weekend about acting workshops .
