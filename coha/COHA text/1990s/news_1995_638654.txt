<p> PALAU , Micronesia - It 's rush hour on the reef at Blue Corner , the high-voltage crossroads of marine life in the scuba-diving mecca of Palau . Schools of fish fly along the ripping current in every direction for an underwater version of the Valley Highway at 5 o'clock , except no speed limit is observed . <p> And this is just the entry point for a 40-minute journey that seems to pass in just that many seconds . It gets even better midway through the underwater excursion . <p> Consistent ratings <p> Scuba diving itself does n't get much better than Palau , an island republic in the Western Pacific about 800 miles southwest of Guam . The narrow , 100-mile archipelago of coral atolls , lying in the same time zone as Tokyo , offers some of the most diverse marine populations on the planet . Rarely a dive goes by without a shark visit , but schooling fish - barracudas , tuna , Napoleon wrasse ( 200-pound gargantuans resembling bulked-up parrotfish ) - are another attraction . The warm currents feed spectacular coral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunge through seemingly endless drops . <p> Consistently rated by marine biologists and divers to be among the top seven diving wonders in the world , few experts can agree on any place better . <p> " You have the two most state-of-the-art live-aboards there ( Palau Aggressor and Sun Dancer ) . There 's no other place with two like that , " said David Adams , editor of Undercurrent , the Consumer Reports of the dive travel industry . " Our readers come back consistently saying Palau is No. 1 . <p> Total experience <p> Rating scuba diving sites is as subjective as ranking museums in Europe or ski slopes in Colorado . There are destinations with more mantas ( Yap ) , wrecks ( Truk ) , turtles ( Sipadan , off Borneo ) , more comfortable boats and shorter trips ( most places ) and more hotel selection . The total experience on Palau sets it apart : the warm water that makes wet suits unnecessary , the unrivaled visibility , the diversity of marine life and the endless walls splashed with vibrant color . <p> Dive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant attention , is essential . <p> " First and foremost to me is the safety and quality of the diver operators , the boats , equipment and training of divemasters , " said Roger Bailiff , co-owner of Scuba Den , the Denver-area dive shop with the longest continuous ownership . " Then I look at the quality of the macro life ( coral growth and tiny aquatic creatures ) and quality of the reef . Blue Corner is as exciting a dive as I 've ever made . <p> " Some say the Red Sea is better , but what 's better ? A big part of Palau is the personal safety . When you consider the quality of the fish and coral , I do n't think you can beat Palau . " <p> Further testimony was given by the fact that renowned underwater photographer Al Giddings booked dive operator Neco Marine 's best boat in May for a six-week stay . <p> Any discussion of Palau diving starts with Blue Corner , so named because the wall forms a 90-degree angle , jutting out to open sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from the lagoon create a constant exchange of marine population . " Diving and Snorkeling Guide to Palau " lists Blue Corner 's top attraction as " sensory overload . " <p> Well , that 's a start . Divers drift along the wall until coming to a cut . The trick is to stay low to avoid being swept away from the next turn . If that fails , it helps to have a dive guide provide a tow . Then the group of divers makes its way cross current to a ledge looking directly out on the ocean . From the underwater perch , hanging on for dear life against the current , it 's a Rose Bowl Parade of color interspersed with sharks , silver flashes of tuna and schooling smaller fish . <p> Hovering behind our group were six giant green Napoleon wrasses , who seemed to enjoy watching divers . <p> There are several dive sites similar to Blue Corner , as well as those within the relative confines of the lagoon formed by the arc of islands . Those dives , largely free of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a squid and an octopus ) , red feathery lionfish and giant clams . Spectacular yellow sea fans highlight a boundless assortment of coral . Boat rides to the dive site take upward of an hour , but cruising around the Rock Islands - heavily vegetated masses rising just above the water - is a treat . Several offer tiny beaches for picnic lunches . <p> For all of the open-water diving opportunities , Palau also is known for one of the best freshwater-lake dives . A hike up the ridges of one of the islands reveals a jungle setting complete with the sights and sounds of an " Indiana Jones " movie . Strictly a snorkel dive ( because logistics prohibit hauling heavy tanks up the hill with its razor-sharp coral edges ) , the greenish lake is home to tens of thousands of grapefruit-size , nonstinging jellyfish . The white and orange globs , long removed from natural predators , have lost their ability to deliver the venomous stings that are a bane to divers . <p> For more variety , there are dozens of shipwrecks , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> An average day of diving means an 8 a.m. departure and a late-afternoon return , leaving little time for topside touring . <p> However lengthy the rides to dive sites , one fact remains . Many divers , no matter how many places they 've gone , feel Blue Corner is like diving again for the first time . <p> IF YOU GO TO PALAU <p> Where : Palau was an American trust territory from the end of World War II until it declared itself independent last fall . There 's a definite stamp of American youth culture evident in backward baseball caps , Michael Jordan T-shirts and cars with thundering speakers . More trappings of " civilization " are on the way : A cab driver pointed out the main town 's first traffic signal . <p> English is widely spoken . <p> Palau has changed hands many times . Japan , Germany , Spain and Great Britain occupied the country at different times since the 18th century . <p> Getting there : Continental Micronesia is the only carrier serving Micronesia , the area of Oceania north of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itinerary is a West Coast departure from Los Angeles or San Francisco to Honolulu ( about 5 1/2 hours ) , followed by a seven-hour flight to Guam . After an overnight in Guam or an airport layover after the red-eye out of Honolulu , there 's a relatively short flight to Palau . Good news for those who dislike puddle jumpers : This is strictly jet service . <p> Coach fare is $ 1,476 , from the West Coast . Continental no longer flies directly from Denver to the West Coast ( one stop through Houston ) . <p> Where to stay : Palau has a range of lodging , from several budget hotels ( West Plaza Desekel , D.W. Motel ) to the ultra-luxury Palau Pacific Resort . The latter is the only beachfront property . In between is the Sunrise Villa , which offers views of the lagoon and a swimming pool . The resort and Sunrise Villa are fairly removed from the downtown restaurants . An alternative is the live-aboard boats providing more diving opportunities . Eight-day packages including meals start at $ 2,000 for the Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't included . ) <p> Dive operators : Neco Marine , one of four established dive operations , has an unblemished safety record and the vote of several Denver-area dive shops . Boats are n't overcrowded , as is the case with some other operators . Before booking , check whether an operator caters to new divers , a tipoff that experienced divers might not get to take advantage of the more challenging dive sites . <p> What it costs .

Meals are very reasonable ( under $ 20 ) , with a variety of Japanese , Chinese and American fare . <p> Safety : While dive operators are careful with their patrons and divers look out for each other , there always is the possibility of an accident . Victims of decompression sickness ( from either staying too deep too long or ascending too rapidly ) no longer have to be transported to Guam for treatment . Palau National Hospital has just installed the nation 's first hyperbaric ( decompression ) chamber . What to bring : A valid U.S. passport and plenty of cash . ( Palau 's official currency is the U.S. dollar . ) Few shops and restaurants , except for the two high-end hotels , accept credit cards . <p> There 's no need for a heavy wet suit .
