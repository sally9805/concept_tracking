THE GUAYASAMIN FOUNDATION PROTECTS A NATIONAL PATRIMONY FOR THE PEOPLE OF ECUADOR <p> IT IS THE BIRTHRIGHT of every quiteno to reach out and touch a mountain . In the Ecuadorean city of Quito , squeezed 17 kilometers along a narrow valley high in the Sierra between two parallel ranges of the Andes , a mountain vista is never far away . But some views are better than others and halfway up a mountain in an exclusive area of Quito appropriately called Bellavista , lies land with a view that vies with some of the most expensive real estate in the world . This is the place Oswaldo Guayasamin , the world-famous painter , muralist and sculptor whose name is inseparable from modern art in Ecuador , has chosen to live and work . But this 5600-meter estate is not the private retreat of a hugely successful artist whose work can command as much as a million dollars . It is , instead , the home of Fundacion Guayasamin and its sister organization Taller Guayasamin S.A. It includes a museum containing Guayasamin 's lifetime collection of pre-Columbian archaeological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works by Guayasamin and other contemporary artists , a jewelry shop specializing in pre-Columbian and folk-art designs , an art library , and a collection of workshops and ateliers with a staff of 70-plus carpenters , artisans , art restorers , artists and support staff working together to preserve and extend South American traditional and contemporary art forms . <p> Everything  --  the land , the buildings , the art collections and , indeed , Guayasamin 's family home and studio  --  belong to the people of Ecuador . But the day-to-day operations of the Foundation are shouldered almost entirely by the gregarious artist 's extended family , a sprawling , diverse and energetic group of individuals similar in character to the city of Quito , Ecuador 's capital and the Guayasamin family 's hometown . <p> Sixteen years ago , Oswaldo Guayasamin , then in his late fifties , called a family conference . Some important decisions were pending . At the top of the agenda were his personal collections of pre-Columbian and Spanish colonial art which he had accumulated over almost half a century . His interest in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his father , a carpenter , brought home some pre-Hispanic vases he had unearthed while working on a construction project in the provincial town of Latacunga . By the time Guayasamin was in his twenties and his career as an artist was beginning to take off , he had developed a serious interest in the symbols and motifs used by the pre-Columbian peoples of South America . He travelled restlessly around South America , sketching the hard lives of the Indians , blacks and poor as he went , and adding to his personal collection of pre-Hispanic artifacts . By the mid-seventies when this family conference was held , Guayasamin had collected more than 3000 archaeological pieces . <p> Guayasamin 's interest in colonial religious art developed as a natural corollary of this passion for pre-Columbian artifacts . He had grown up in the heart of Old Quito surrounded by a rich concentration of colonial churches and religious art treasures . Although he had rejected formal Catholicism at an early age , Guayasamin remained fascinated with the Spanish colonials ' graphic depictions of human suffering in their religious art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this so-called Spanish colonial art was in fact the handiwork of Indian and mestizo artisans , working under the direction of the Catholic Church heirarchy . He believed that their work , much of it anonymous , together with the Incan and pre-Incan artifacts dating back to the centuries before the Spaniards arrived in the early 1500s , represented Ecuador 's true patrimony . Ecuador 's population is predominately indigenous or mixed blood ( 40 percent Indian , 40 percent mestizo ) and Guayasamln 's background is typical . He was the eldest from a poor family of 10 children with a mestizo mother and Indian father ( Guayasamin means white bird in Quechua , the language Ecuador 's Indians inherited from the Incas ) . <p> Over the years Guayasamin had collected 800 pieces of Spanish colonial religious art . Many of them focussed on the bloody agonies of the crucifixion and sufferings of the saints , a theme Guayasamin transferred to his first body of work called Huacaynan , Quechua for " The Path of Tears . " The 103 paintings of Huacaynan , which depicted with moving empathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , caused a sensation when they were exhibited for the first time in 1952 in Quito 's Museum of Colonial Art . ( Huacaynan subsequently was exhibited internationally , including a show at the Organization of American States in Washington , D.C. It won several awards , among them the grand prize at the Second Hispano-American Biennial in Barcelona in 1956 . ) <p> A second reason for the urgency of this family meeting was Guayasamin 's concern about a collection of his own work from the second stage of his career ( 1952-1966 ) when he concentrated , on the universal theme of human suffering . Entitled " The Age of Anger , " the collection had been exhibited in major galleries in Europe and South America . Guayasamin , however , had resisted selling individual pieces from the 250 paintings in the oeuvre , preferring to maintain its integrity as a single body of work . Now that he was about to embark on a new artistic theme  --  peace and maternal ternal love , in honor of his mother who died at the age of 35  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find an appropriate home . <p> At this historic family gathering , the Guayasamins decided that the family patriarch would donate his entire personal art collection  --  which included 100 contemporary artworks from all over the world and 300 more from various past epochs and much of his own work , including all of " The Age of Anger "  --  to the people of Ecuador . The home for this national patrimony would be a nonprofit organization called Fundaci6n Guayasamin . And his family would be the keepers of the flame . <p> A first-time visitor to Fundacion Guayasamin is immediately impressed by its ambience of calm , personal harmony and efficiency . From the moment you step inside the Foundation 's green and spacious grounds , you feel you are in competent hands . A uniformed attendant politely asks for the 1,000-sucre admission charge ( US$0.85 ) and invites you to proceed to a low white building trimmed with Spanish tiles and wrought iron . Here a second attendant wearing an understated Foundation uniform  --  classic earth-toned vest and skirt with tailored blouse  --  greets you and offers guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-Columbian artifacts and colonial religious art , both collections intelligently labelled and amply displayed . You are drawn to a large painting of the crucifixion in which the Christ figure is discreetly covered waist to knee by a skirt . Not just any skirt but a distinctly feminine one , filmy and bellshaped like something the corps de ballet would wear in Swan Lake . " Oh that , " the attendant says , appreciating the humor in the juxtaposition , " it 's just one colonial artist 's version of the fig leaf . " <p> Wherever you go , help is always nearby but never intrusive . Staff members demonstrate range of knowledge as they take you through the garden embellished by Guayasamin 's sculptures on low white plinths ; the art gallery exhibiting contemporary artists as well as the permanent Guayasamin collection ; or the studio displaying folk art and finely crafted jewelry . <p> Four of Guayasamin 's seven children run the Foundation . Pablo , his eldest son , is the director ; Saskia , his eldest daughter , is in charge of communications . Cristobal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small staff make lithographs , serigraphs and etchings of his father 's work . Verenice , youngest from Guayasamin 's first marriage ( he has married three times ) , directs the jewelry studio . Most of the 70-odd staffers working under the four siblings are relatives , in-laws , or relatives of relatives . The Guayasamin definition of family is comfortably fluid . <p> Fundacion Guayasamin costs 300 million sucres ( US$255.000 ) a year to run , according to Foundation director Pablo Guayasamin . The proceeds from admission charges plus revenues from sales of reproductions , jewelry , sculpture and folk art do not cover costs , he says . His father personally kicks in whatever is needed to balance the books at the end of each year and " not one sucre comes from government or from private donations . " <p> Guayasamin himself ( Oswaldo Guayasamin signs and refers to himself only by his last name ) is removed from the day-to-day operations of the Foundation . His home-cum-studio is physically separate and , although legally part of the Foundation , is not open to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public-spirited pride with which the Foundation is run clearly flows from the person of Guayasamin , who emanates an easy mix of authority and warmth that inspires both loyalty and professionalism . Speaking of his patron , one Foundation employee remarks , " He is very warm , very human , very gentle . " <p> The expansive personality of Guayasamin encompasses more than a rare and marvellous integration of family and professional life . In this mountain-isolated Andean republic bound together by Catholicism and traditional family ties , Guayasamin shares his elegant home/studio overlooking the Foundation museums , galleries and workshops with a young and beautiful Spanish companera . And , right next door , also on Foundation property , lives daughter Verenice with her mother ( Guayasamin 's first wife ) , Verenice 's son and his companera ( both students ) and their small child , who is looked after by the Foundation 's day-care staff . Every Sunday , the entire Guayasamin connection gathers en famille to relax around the swimming pool . Verenice , who delights in telling this tale of extended-family bliss , adds : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thailand , for example , for two , three months at a time  --  yes , all of us , including mi madre , pappy and his companera . You can see why people call us Clan Guayasamin ! " <p> Verenice began working with her father 25 years ago when he started selling his personal line of jewelry to tourists visiting his home/workshop , then in the modest storey-and-a-half building that now houses the pre-Columbian and Spanish colonial art collection . When the Foundation was formed in 1976 and the jewelry shop became a separate operation , Verenice continued as an assistant , producing designs which are inspired by pre-Columbian motifs and symbols and have become models for jewelry design throughout Ecuador . <p> Several years ago , while helping to put together an exhibit of necklaces for display in the museum , Verenice collected a large assortment of pre-Columbian stones . She became immersed in the work , producing one necklace for the museum display using purely indigenous designs and fashioning another with her own personal stamp . Before long she had a substantial pile of work . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " her father suggested . Verenice was reluctant but Guayasamin continued to gently encourage her . Five years ago , she put together an exhibit of her own designs in the Ecuadorean port city of Guayaquil . To her surprise , the entire exhibit sold out . Now after putting in long hours at the Foundation , Verenice retreats in the evenings to her private studio , a few blocks away . She puts together what she calls " collections " of her work , arranged in patterns and color combinations , and exhibits them " as if they were paintings . " To date , she has had exhibitions in Peru , Bolivia , Panama , Brazil , Venezuela , Switzerland , Germany and Canada . <p> Verenice is transformed by the joy of finding her creative voice . As the daughter of the renowned Guayasamin this was not easy , she says . Her pappy , as she calls him with enormous affection , " shines so brilliantly it is difficult for us children to take a small light for ourselves . " She points to her brother Cristobal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a talented artist in his own right . But his father 's personality and talent is such that Cristobal is content to work in his shadow , reproducing his father 's work instead of exhibiting his own . Cristobal has made his peace with this role , Verenice says , " but for me it is not enough . " <p> Verenice sums up the secret of the success of the Guayasamin Clan  --  " We are united by the ideal of the Foundation . " And the people of Ecuador are fortunate to be the beneficiaries of this extraordinary family 's unifying goal . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : World-famous artist and patron , Oswaldo Guayasamin <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Some of the world 's rarest pre-Columbian artifacts are exhibited in one of the museum 's two main galleries <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Religious objects and colonial paintings , many by anonymous Indian artists , line the walls of this gallery . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Guayasamin modern home and studio displays unusual angles and graceful colonnades reminiscent of coloniak structure <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family 's artistic clan , creates unique pre-Columbian style jewelry in her studio <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A print workshop under the supervision of son Cristobal executes the Maestro 's designs <p> BY LORAL DEAN <p> <p> Loral Dean is a freelance writer living in Toronto . <p> CARVING IN A TRADITION <p> In one of several small workshops below Guayasamin 's home and studio , three artisans paint the colorful balsa wood carvings for display in the Foundation jewelry shop . These carvings are styled after the famous bread-dough figurines and Christmas tree ornaments made for centuries in the tiny village of Calderon , 10 kilometers north of Quito . The use of balsa wood instead of bread dough began with Guayasamin 's father , a carpenter by trade , who carved balsa-wood shapes based on the Calderon guaguas de pan but used his son 's innovative designs . The workshop today is a personal remembrance of Guayasamin 's father as well as a means of preserving the traditional Calder6n folk art .
