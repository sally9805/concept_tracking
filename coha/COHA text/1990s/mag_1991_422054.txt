Section : News you can use ; Cover story Unconventional medicine , long dismissed by mainstream doctors , is getting a closer look . Some approaches seem promising indeed <p> Millions of Americans probably grumbled into their coffee , " So ? I knew that , " when they read last month that people who are under stress get more colds than people who are not . It was the finding of a quite serious study in the New England Journal of Medicine , arguably the world 's leading medical journal . The average three-colds-a-winter type , of course , is aware that if he is pressured at the office , rushed at home and gets too little rest , recreation and exercise , something has to give . <p> But behind that prosaic conclusion lurked a larger and more intriguing story . For the study added another morsel of evidence to a new field of research examining the tantalizing relationship between brain and body  --  from colds to cancer and heart disease . Public enthusiasm for the notion of a link between emotions and health  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at a peak , fed by a stack of recent bestsellers . Among them : the late Norman Cousins 's " Head First : The Biology of Hope and the Healing Power of the Human Spirit ' ' ; " Love , Medicine and Miracles " by Bernie Siegel , and " Quantum Healing : Exploring the Frontiers of Mind-Body Medicine ' and " Perfect Health : The Complete Mind-Body Guide , ' both by Deepak Chopra , an M.D. endocrinologist and proselytizer for ayurvedic healing , which originated in India ( see Page 77 ) . <p> And support , albeit qualified , is trickling in from the scientific community . It seems that mind-body medicine and some alternative medical practices long relegated to the fringes of Western healing might work after all . Meditation , hypnosis , acupuncture , homeopathy , yoga , aromatherapy , biofeedback and visualization are all getting a new look as mainstream doctors yield to patients ' demands for options that do n't involve traditional tests , drugs and surgery . <p> Cancer doctors at Sloan- Kettering in New York and M.D. Anderson in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into group psychotherapy , which may include meditation and training in visualizing their bodies ' internal battle against invading cancer cells . A 10-year study by David Spiegel , professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University , found that breast cancer patients who took part in support groups and practiced self-hypnosis to ease discomfort from surgery and chemotherapy survived twice as long on average as patients who did not . Heart specialists , too , are sending more angina sufferers , heart attack victims and people with high blood pressure to biofeedback and stress-reduction programs as a supplement to drugs , dietary changes and exercise . " I am convinced that the psychological measures used to treat or prevent heart disease are just as important as anything else we do , ' says Dean Ornish , a preventive-medicine expert at the University of California at San Francisco . <p> Many doctors complain that the hype still tends to outrun the evidence . By the usual standards , no proof exists that meditation alone will cure or prevent heart disease or cancer . And some alternative techniques lack even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have attracted the most attention and collected the largest number of favorable reviews . They 're not magic , and how they work is still largely mysterious  --  but that they work , for some people and against some ailments , is becoming harder to deny . Here is what is known about these three approaches to healing . ACUPUNCTURE : Needles in strategic places <p> American doctors have tolerated acupuncture practitioners in their midst since the 1930s , mostly with suspicion . But recent developments have opened more than a few eyes  --  and minds . Studies in The Lancet , Pain , Alcoholism : Clinical and Experimental Research and other journals have reported that this 3,000-year-old Chinese treatment , in which hair-thin needles are inserted into the skin at precise points , can work well for some patients with chronic back pain and the pain of arthritis and rheumatism . Most recently , acupuncture has been tapped to ease the pain of alcoholics and drug addicts as they struggle to kick the habit  --  sometimes with dramatic success . <p> But acupuncture has so far defied Western explanation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined pathways of energy , called qi or ch'i , running throughout . When the flow is disrupted , pain or illness results . Acupuncture is based on the belief that points on the skin along the energy pathways are connected to specific organs and body functions and that stimulating them with needles , or sometimes heat , rebalances the energy flow . <p> The best explanation to emerge from Western science so far is that the needles somehow trigger the release of brain chemicals called endorphins , which block or override pain information . In a series of landmark studies at the University of Toronto in the 1970s and ' 80s , physiologist Bruce Pomeranz used acupuncture to anesthetize cats and mice . Then he blocked the effect by injecting the animals with naloxone , a substance that inhibits the release of endorphins . <p> Doctors like Michael Smith , director of substance abuse at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx , simply care that acupuncture works . " I did not expect acupuncture to be as effective as it has been , ' says Smith . Studies at Lincoln show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a solid three months  --  high compared with other programs . The city of New York has ponied up $2 million to fund 25 other acupuncture treatment programs , and 200 drug-treatment programs nationwide now use acupuncture . <p> Mainstream medicine is n't exactly obsolete . While practitioners claim that acupuncture works against ills from allergies and high blood pressure to sexual dysfunction , the proof is n't there . And the number of U.S. doctors using acupuncture is tiny . Of the nation 's 550,000 doctors , an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 employ acupuncture in their practice , though this is up from fewer than 500 a decade ago . In 24 states , acupuncture can be performed only by a physician . <p> Few of the estimated 7,000 non-M.D. acupuncturists in the United States mix Western and Chinese medicine , though most will urge patients to see an M.D. if a problem warrants . " I would avoid any acupuncturist who promises too much or seems scornful of Western medicine , ' warns Paul Karsten , academic dean of the Northwest Institute of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license non-M.D. acupuncturists based mostly on certification from the National Commission for the Certification of Acupuncturists , which requires training at an acupuncture school or a three-to-six-year apprenticeship . The 5,000 certified acupuncturists in the United States use the designation " C.A. " after their name . <p> Just as doctors follow guidelines for surgery or drug prescriptions , acupuncturists have a set of guidelines based on Chinese texts and charts . But individual habits and preferences have a profound influence . There are 67 acupuncture points related to bladder disorders , for example . One practitioner may insert four or five needles at various points to treat bladder irritation or a urinary problem while another practitioner will use different points , depending on his reading of patient and problem . <p> The needles are usually wiggled into place and left there for 10 minutes to an hour . The needles are much thinner than those used for injections , and many Westerners are surprised by the lack of pain  --  though some spots are more sensitive than others and some people feel a small prick or burning sensation . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked them to outbreaks of hepatitis and to internal injury , though such incidents are very rare . In the age of AIDS , disposable needles are the rule . The number of visits depends on the ailment , but averages five or six at $40 to $50 each . Health insurance companies , of course , still consider acupuncture unproven or experimental , and rarely cover the cost . HYPNOSIS : Concentration relieves the pain <p> A doctor hypnotizes a man with parkinsonism , tells him he 'll awaken completely well , and the man arises free of the debilitating tremors that dog his hours . An asthmatic is put under hypnosis and snaps out wheeze-free . Such reports , which have been popping up with some regularity in medical journals , might seem more at home in a supermarket tabloid . But some 15,000 doctors are combining hypnotherapy with conventional treatments to ease the symptoms of migraines and arthritis  --  even to heal burns faster . Their successes have sufficiently wowed the American Medical Association 's Council on Scientific Affairs that the group has called for more research into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pediatrics suggest that hypnotherapy helps patients tap their bodies ' own power to heal . Ulcer patients apparently are able to control the secretion of stomach acid ; sick kids seemingly can turn on their immune systems . Other studies suggest that hypnosis helps fight inflammation and widens blood vessels and airways . <p> Few investigators can explain how . Some think hypnosis opens a direct line to the limbic system , a brain center linked to emotion and to normally involuntary activities like digestion and hormone regulation . Or hypnosis may alter awareness so that the brain simply does n't react to pain or nausea . <p> What hypnosis does not do is cure disease . " It 's not the medical condition that responds to hypnosis , it 's the patient , ' says Harold Wain , director of the psychiatric consultation liaison clinic at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington , D.C. " We use hypnotic techniques every day and in every ward . ' Under hypnosis , even claustrophobic patients remain calm and motionless inside a coffinlike enclosure for a solid hour during brain scans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere . Retired Army nurse Doris Russell-Terrell of Fort Meade , Md. , drifts off to her favorite reading chair at home . Drugs alone could not quench the fiery nerve pain that has dogged her since kidney surgery 10 years ago , but hypnosis can . While Russell-Terrell is in a trance , Wain administers imaginary anesthetics that keep her pain at bay for weeks . <p> Studies show that about 94 percent of patients get some benefit from hypnosis  --  at least relaxation . Patients who are motivated and readily hypnotized get far more out of it , says Wain . The importance of the patient 's attitude makes some practitioners wonder whether the benefits are due to a placebo effect . <p> Whatever the mechanism , it is clear that cancer patients can undergo chemotherapy without the usual nausea if they are first hypnotized . Burn patients recover faster and with less medication if they are hypnotized within two hours of receiving their burns and told that they will heal quickly and painlessly . Researchers think hypnotherapy gives them the ability to will the release of anti-inflammatory substances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgeon at the Etobicoke General Hospital in Toronto , finds that post-surgical hypnotic suggestions can see his patients through breast reconstructions and tummy tucks with less bleeding , fewer complications and quicker recovery . <p> Many doctors still dismiss hypnosis , even though the AMA labeled it legitimate 35 years ago . But the number of nonbelievers seems to be shrinking . " I can understand the skeptics . I was once the worst of them , ' says Karen Olness , a professor of pediatrics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland . It was during her early practice , when a medical colleague taught her self-hypnosis to relieve her own stress-induced abdominal pain , that she first started thinking of the technique as more than mere hocus-pocus . Over 20 years , she has found that hypnosis helps children with everything from migraines to sickle cell anemia . It even prompts kids with diabetes to stick to their regimen of diet , exercise and medication . " There has been a lot of lip service about mind-body connections , ' she says . " Hypnotherapy provides a tool to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses is up 30 percent over last year , according to the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis , an association of 3,000 physicians , psychologists and dentists who use hypnotherapy . The group will provide a list of practitioners ( send a stamped , self-addressed envelope to 2200 East Devon Avenue , Suite 291 , Des Plaines , IL 60018 ) . Even if hypnosis turns out to be only a sugar pill for the mind , it is a weapon against pain and fear that may work when conventional medicine falls short . BIOFEEDBACK : Monitoring your mind <p> Fifteen years ago , psychologist Michael McKee of the Cleveland Clinic was discussing with a colleague a slew of medical reports showing that a technique called biofeedback could enable people to mentally control seemingly involuntary conditions like heart rate and chronic pain . The scientists decided to see if biofeedback really worked . McKee 's colleague borrowed a device that measures muscle contraction , jabbed the needle into McKee 's forehead and said " OK , relax . " At this point McKee decided that biofeedback did n't have much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biofeedback research , devising gentler measurements . Meanwhile , biofeedback rode the same roller coaster as interferon and other " breakthroughs "  --  a run of breathtaking optimism followed by a precipitous plunge as scientists backed away from unrealized promises . <p> The ride has smoothed out . Biofeedback  --  broadly , any technique in which people alter automatic functions like heart rate by concentrating on them  --  now is used routinely to prevent or treat migraine or tension headaches , incontinence , mild hypertension , chronic pain , stress and anxiety disorders . Mindful of the early euphoria , researchers quickly caution that biofeedback is no panacea . " It should n't be the focus of therapy for most problems that come through general medicine , ' says psychologist Bruce Masek of Children 's Hospital in Boston . Physical problems must be ruled out first , and biofeedback alone is generally not enough . A child may be able to use biofeedback training to relax when he senses a school-induced migraine coming on . But he also needs to learn coping strategies to prevent or at least lessen stress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long way from McKee 's needle . There is absolutely no discomfort . Clinicians slip temperature , sweat or blood-flow sensors onto fingers or hands , strap blood-pressure cuffs around the arms or fasten suction-cup-type electrical sensors to various parts of the body . The patient then watches a display or listens to a tone that indicates how close he is getting to the desired result , such as hand warming or muscle relaxation . <p> Just how a person can " think " those changes into reality , however , remains a frustrating mystery . About all researchers can do is compare biofeedback to basketball . Try a shot blindfolded , and when you miss you 'll have no idea how to adjust your aim . Take the blindfold off and you can adjust successfully . <p> The debate over the workings of biofeedback has n't stopped it from gaining respectability . It is practiced at such paragons of medicine as the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic . New uses are on the way . A $1,700 posture-training device called Micro Straight is about to go on the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that brace the curved spines of people with scoliosis . The device , built around a simple set of wires that encircle the back , beeps softly when a wearer slouches , reminding her to straighten up . <p> One measure of biofeedback 's growing acceptance is the fact that many insurers will pay for training sessions . The Prudential Insurance Co. , for example , generally reimburses for treatment of migraines , muscle tension , hypertension , chronic pain and anxiety , including home treatment when necessary . Aetna and John Hancock also pay for some kinds of treatment . But the national Blue Cross-Blue Shield parent organization recommends that the individual baby Blues not reimburse for biofeedback . <p> Recourse to biofeedback should come only after a full medical investigation to determine whether other therapy might be more appropriate . The medical professional who recommends biofeedback should also be able to suggest a practitioner . The Biofeedback Certification Institute of America has credentialed 1,800 psychologists , doctors , nurses , dentists , social workers and physical therapists . Uncertified therapists can also be qualified ; you 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Depending on the problem , you might need just a few sessions or as many as 30 , at a cost ranging from $50 to $150 per session . Kids learn faster than adults . <p> Twelve-year-old Katie Kellett of St. Louis tried biofeedback after eight weeks of daily migraines that would n't respond to drugs . " I thought it sounded kind of stupid , ' she says now . " But it 's not . " She has n't eliminated her migraines , but she has cut down on their frequency and severity . Her big complaint : The training sessions are boring . HOW ACUPUNCTURE WORKS <p> Western doctors can not fully explain why inserting an acupuncture needle in the hand soothes pain in the shoulder . This is one likely scenario . Pain signals from shoulder injury or overuse travel to the brain , where the pain is perceived . An acupuncture needle triggers the release of endorphins and enkephalins , brain substances that inhibit pain or induce a sense of well-being . Pain eases as the substances block pain signals from being transmitted through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HOW HYPNOSIS WORKS <p> Hypnosis can help tune out pain and assert command over involuntary body functions . The patient focuses on a voice , an object , a mental image or his own growing relaxation . The brain 's limbic system , which affects emotion and controls involuntary activities is stimulated . Brain-wave patterns shift ; pulse and breathing slow ; blood pressure drops . The limbic system responds to suggestions to dilate the bronchial tubes , reduce stomach acid or otherwise modify the body 's problem behavior . HOW BIOFEEDBACK WORKS <p> In Raynaud 's disease , the arteries supplying blood to the hands abruptly narrow in cold weather , causing discomfort from mild tingling to acute pain . Biofeedback techniques can reopen the arteries . The patient watches a monitor that displays her hand temperature . She is instructed to relax and think about warming her hands . The message goes to the hypothalamus , a region of the brain that functions as the body 's thermostat . The hypothalamus sends a message to blood vessels in the hands and arms to open up and let blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caption ( Illustration by Steve MacCracken for USN &WR); <p> Picture : Ancient art .

So this is acupuncture . <p> It was sharp , persistent pain in my lower back that led me to the makeshift office of Upper East Side acupuncturist Keichi Murata . Murata had treated a similarly afflicted cousin of mine with much success . I was skeptical at first . But this time , my homegrown therapy of double doses of Advil and a few nights sleeping on the floor had not chased away the aches . <p> Murata began our session with a back massage so deep and soothing that I might have dozed off if I had n't been apprehensive about what was to come : dozens of hair-thin needles . His hands searched out specific points alongside my spine and on both legs . At each point , he gently tapped a needle into my skin with his finger and twirled it deeper . He said the needles penetrated up to a quarter inch , but the pain was less than that from a pin prick . <p> Finally , Murata placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on different spots on my back . He lit the cones and immediately snuffed them out . The smoldering herbs were like button-size heating pads . The needles , Murata explained , would release the pain from tightened muscles , while the warm mugwort would increase circulation and cleanse the affected areas . The entire treatment was repeated on my chest , stomach and the fronts of my legs . Afterwards , the Tokyo-educated and trained healer showed me stretches that no physical therapist had ever suggested , to help prevent the problem from recurring . I would n't have to visit Murata again , he said , unless the pain returned . <p> I left Murata 's apartment , back pain completely gone . It returned in a milder form over the next day or so , but then disappeared . A single visit to an acupuncturist had cost more than Advil , but I felt my $60 was well spent . After 16 months , my back still has n't registered a twinge . <p> By Daniel P. Wiener <p> OVERDOSING ON STRESS , AND ON THE 101 WAYS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniquely American tradition of entrepreneurship , stress has spawned a cottage industry . Stress reduction programs have sprouted in hospitals , the workplace and free-standing clinics . Massage therapists , acupuncturists and yoga instructors promise relief from stress and its attendant headaches , backaches , anxiety , fatigue and sleeplessness . <p> Most legitimate programs rely on a few basics pioneered in the 1970s and ' 80s by doctors like Herbert Benson of Boston 's New England Deaconness Hospital , author of " The Relaxation Response . " These elements include biofeedback ( see Page 73 ) , meditation and breathing techniques to calm the mind , and yoga and progressive muscle relaxation , in which first one muscle and then another is alternately tensed and relaxed , to calm the body . <p> The goal of all stress reduction programs is the same , but the paths vary . The Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center , for example , takes a Buddhist approach , shorn of religious content , that emphasizes a concept called mindfulness in an eight-week training program of meditation and yoga . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the immediate present and not be distracted by life 's constant impending demands . " We try to teach people to be patient observers of their life even as they live it , ' says Director Jon Kabat-Zinn , a molecular biologist . By contrast , the stress reduction program developed at the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito , Calif. , coaches heart disease patients in yoga , relaxation and breathing techniques . In addition , Director Dean Ornish , a physician on the faculty of the University of California at San Francisco , emphasizes group support and social interaction . " Much of the stress in our society results from a lack of community and loneliness , ' he contends . <p> The Mind/Body Clinic at New England Deaconness takes another tack , relying on meditation in which participants are taught to focus on a word , phrase or their own slowed-down breathing in a silent 20-minute session or two 10-minute sessions every day . Participants also get instruction in ways to purge their minds of negative , angry thoughts . <p> Nurses , psychologists and social workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , since many people seek stress reduction for health-related complaints . Opportunists with little training are numerous , says Paul Rosch , president of the American Institute of Stress , an educational and research group in Yonkers , N.Y . Programs to avoid include those that consist of only a lecture or two , those that exaggerate the health benefits of stress reduction or those linked to doctrinaire religious beliefs . <p> Experts in behavioral medicine say that most people generally do feel better when they practice stress reduction , and a growing number of studies back up that claim . More important , most students do n't backslide . A few Type A 's , however , wind up even more stressed because of unrealistic expectations . " People who expect immediate inner calm and peace can become easily frustrated , ' says Kabat-Zinn . True inner peace , he notes , is ever elusive . <p> Picture : Yoga therapy . Some cardiologists emphasize relaxation nearly as much as diet . ( Kevin Horan for USN &WR); <p>           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
