Following an unseasonable thaw and disastrous flooding , spring came early to Moose County , 400 miles north of everywhere .

He glanced furtively to the left and right , and , leaving the motor running , he opened the tailgate . Then he unlocked the trunk of the sedan and quickly transferred something from his vehicle to the other , after which he lost no time in driving away . might have described him as a Caucasian male , middle-aged , about six feet two , with slightly graying hair and an enormous pepper-and-salt moustache .

" Then he stopped at the used book store and browsed for a while , buying a 1939 copy of Nathanael West 's book , The Day of the Locust . At Toodle 's Market he asked Grandma Toodle to help him select fruit and vegetables for Polly . These he transferred to her car on the library parking lot , hoping to avoid notice by the ubiquitous busybodies. he heard sirens and saw flashing lights heading south on Main Street . With a journalist 's instinct he followed the emergency vans , at the same time calling the city desk on the car phone . earlier , and Roger 's already on his way there .

One passenger appeared to be trapped inside the worst wreck . Horrified students crowded the school lawn , restrained by a yellow cordon of police tape . Ambulance crews were in action . A drunk driver was hustled to a patrol car . Stretcher bearers rushed one serious case to a medical helicopter that had landed on the school parking lot . Meanwhile , groans and cries rose from the shocked onlookers as they recognized their bloodied classmates . Finally the rescue squad 's metal cutters sliced through the car body to reach the trapped victim , who was taken away in a body bag . system ordered all students to return to the building at once and report to the auditorium . stroked his moustache in perplexity and beckoned to the reporter , who had started packing his photo gear .

He was a native of Moose County , and junior Goodwinter , the young managing editor , was a fourth-generation native . Arch Riker , the publisher , was a transplant from Down Below , reluctant to abandon his journalistic integrity .

" Koko and Yum Yum turned up their well-bred noses at anything less than top-grade red sockeye salmon . Returning home , Qwilleran drove around the Park Circle , where Main Street divided into one-way northbound and southbound lanes . On the perimeter of the traffic circle were two venerable churches , the stately courthouse , and a public library that resembled a Greek temple . Yet the most imposing structure was a fieldstone cube that sparkled in the sunlight . Originally the Klingenschoen mansion , it was now a small theater for plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-stall carriage house was still there , and the apartment above was occupied by a woman who took special orders for meatloaf , macaroni and cheese , and other freezables for a bachelor 's larder . through an ornamental iron gateway into an ancient grove of evergreens so dense that all was dark and silent even in midday . Suddenly the drive opened into a clearing where a huge structure , more than a hundred years old , loomed like an enchanted castle . This was Qwilleran 's barn , octagonal and four stories high . walls so thick that small windows cut in the stone looked like crossbow ports in a medieval fort . Above the foundation the walls were shingled with weathered wood , and the octagonal roof was centered with a cupola . New windows cut in the walls had odd shapes dictated by the massive interior timbers bracing the structure . drive-through barn , with doors large enough for a farm wagon and a team of horses . Now the two large openings were filled with glass panels and doors of human scale . A formal double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single door on the west connected the barnyard with the kitchen . an architect from Down Below , it featured a continuous ramp that spiraled up to the roof , connecting balconies on three levels . In the central open space , which soared a good forty feet , stood a huge white fireplace cube with white cylindrical stacks rising to the roof . The cube divided the main floor into lounge area , library , dining room , and foyer. what the barn proved to be . The cube , a good eight feet high , was a safe perch just beyond human reach . The ramp was made-to-order for a fifty-yard dash ; before each meal , eight thundering paws spiraled to the top and down again . Odd-shaped windows admitted triangles and rhomboids of sunlight that tantalized the cats by moving throughout the day . checked the antique sea chest that stood at the back door and served for package deliveries . It was empty . He stood with his hand on the doorknob as he had a moment 's qualms about his housemates . Were they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of catly exuberance ?

Circling the main floor counterclockwise , he stopped short when he reached the foyer . " You rascals ! " he said with relief and rebuke . " You gave me a scare ! " gazing out the low-silled windows that flanked the front door . They were watching a congregation of seven black crows just outside the glass . They had never seen such birds at such close range . Briefly , they turned glassy eyes toward the person who had called their names , but they were still under the spell of these creatures who strutted in unison like a drill team -- all seven to the north , then right-about-face and all seven to the south . him to the kitchen , walking stiffly on long slender brown legs .

" He lowered it to the floor and spread the handles . Koko was the first to jump in , settling down in the bottom and making himself as compact as possible . Yum Yum followed , landing on top of him . After some good-natured shifting and squirming , they settled in , and other items were tucked in around them . It was the easiest , quickest , safest way to transport two indoor cats , some reading matter , and a coffee thermos to the gazebo .

" automated , thanks to a Klingenschoen grant , but many subscribers disliked the electronic catalogue . They preferred to make inquiries at the desk and be escorted to the card catalogue by a friendly clerk , who probably attended their church and might even be engaged to marry the son of someone they knew .
