His folks gone Matt heads west to live with relatives , hoping to make the best of a sad situation . But who knew this would happen ? <p> Matt Hollis was still a few miles from his uncle 's ranch when the snow , storm started . The winter sky had been clear when he 'd set out from Auburn in midafternoon . But the clouds had piled up rapidly , getting thicker and darker-veined until the whole sky was the color of coal smoke . The wind had sharpened to an icy breath that buffeted the rented wagon and roan horse . Now , as an early dusk approached , the snow flurries had come abruptly-big flakes swirled by the wind so that the pine forest flanking the trail was a misty blur . The hostler in Auburn had warned him that this might happen ; it often did in late December in the High Sierra foothills . He 'd been offered a bed for the night in the stable , but the prospect had n't appealed to Matt . He 'd already spent too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Uncle Jake and Aunt Ella were n't expecting him until tomorrow , Christmas Eve , which was why he had n't been met at Auburn 's tiny depot . It was just as well , Matt had thought . He was no longer a boy who needed to be met and escorted . He was 15 , strong from farm work and plenty capable of traveling alone and finding his own way . Arriving early or not , the Boyds would n't be pleased to see him . Uncle Jake 's letters had made it plain he was taking Matt in only because this was the final wish of his sister , Matt 's mother . By the same token Matt had come west only because Ma had made him promise to spend at least one Christmas with his aunt and uncle . She 'd put a lot of stock in family , and it was the least he could do to honor her memory . He sat huddled inside his fleece-lined long coat , mittens and cap , feeling sad and very much alone . His thoughts kept returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been born in 1875 and that had been sold for taxes last month . To Christmases past , when both his folks were alive and they 'd had bountiful crops of wheat and corn . Every holiday dinner had been a feast then . Baked turkey and skillet-browned cush-a mixture of wheat bread and corn meal soaked in hot water , then fried with raisins and spices . Sweet potatoes glazed with sorghum . Biscuits smothered in wild plum jelly . Ma 's special dried peach cobbler .... The prospect of Christmas in this unfamiliar mountain wilderness , with Pa and Ma and the farm all gone , was a cheerless one . He 'd never met Aunt Ella or Uncle Jake ; he was a baby when they had moved to California . Ma had said they were good people , honest and hard-working , and that they 'd be glad for his company , but Uncle Jake 's cold letters made Matt believe otherwise . He would stay with them no later than spring , he 'd decided . Then he 'd go back to Kansas . Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't sure , Finally the road crested and began to descend along the rim of a snowskinned meadow . The wind was even more fierce here , without one wall of trees to deflect its force . Ice particles clung to his eyebrows , kept trying to freeze his eyelids shut . It could n't be much farther to the ranch , could it ? Darkness was settling around him when he saw the faint shimmer of light ahead . He scrubbed at his eyes , leaning forward . The glow was off to his left , close to the trail , else he would n't have been able to see it at all . A little farther on , tall fence posts marked the ranch lane . He gigged the weary roan between the posts and through soft , shallow drifts . Sturdy buildings took on shape as he approached : log house , barn , open-sided lean-to and corral , a shed-like outbuilding barely visible beyond the barn . The lamplight came from behind the house 's frost- rimmed windows . Matt halted at the front gate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door . He could 've shouted himself hoarse before anyone inside heard him . So he tried the latch , found the door unbarred , and let the wind push him inside . The big front room was deserted . He leaned back against the door to shut it , then called out , " Uncle Jake , Aunt Ella ! It 's Matt Hollis ! " No one answered . Matt stood scraping snow cake off his face , slapping it from his clothing . The room was warm from a now-banked fire on the hearth . Two lamps were lit here , another in the kitchen beyond . Mistletoe and holly berries hung festively from the rafters , and near the hearth was a cut spruce decorated with red paper and red candles , snippets of cotton and a five-pointed star . He was surprised to see three white stockings tacked to the mantlepiece . His aunt and uncle had no children . A rich , spicy smell drew him into the kitchen . It too was empty . The puncheon table was set for two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking . Almost all the gravy had boiled away , Matt saw , and the rest was close to burning . Frowning , he moved the pot to a far edge . " Aunt Ella ! Uncle Jake ! " Only the wind answered him , howling along the eaves . Quickly Matt searched the other three rooms : One of them-not the smallestevidently would be his ; it contained a comfortable-looking trundle bed made up with a thick quilt . There was no sign of the Boyds there or anywhere else in the house . A sense of wrongness sent him hurrying out again into the icebound darkness . He led the shivering roan to the barn , and as he neared the building he saw that one of the door halves had been blown open and was banging in the wind . Inside it was pitch black . He unlatched the other half , prodded horse and wagon inside , then forced both halves shut . A sulphur match from his emergency supply showed him a windproof railroad lantern on a wall hook . He lighted the wick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boyds ? What had happened here tonight ? Matt hurriedly unharnessed the roan , led it to one of the stalls . Then , carrying the lantern , he bent his lean body once more into the wild white smother outside . Flinty snow half-blinded him as he slogged to the corral . The wind all but took his breath away . When he reached the lean-to , he found a plow horse and a saddle horse huddled together at the rear . They should have been in the barn , not here where they would eventually freeze . Really worried now , Matt fought his way back toward the barn . The snowfall had already covered his tracks , and this turned out to be a blessing . If he had n't taken a slightly different route , he might never have seen the snow-mantled shape pressed against the barn 's side wall . At first he thought it was a barrel or maybe a plow , but still he detoured that way for a closer look . He was almost upon it , before the lantern light showed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur-lined parka hood was a woman 's . Matt cried , " Aunt Ella ! " but the eyes remained frozen shut . He felt the artery in her neck , and relief flooded him when his fingers found a faint pulse . Photograph <p> He lifted and cradled her in his arms , a small woman who weighed hardly more than a hundredweight sack of flour . Even so he was staggering by the time he reached the house . Inside he put her gently on the hearth , took off her wet clothing and wrapped her in a buffalo robe from the Boyds " bedroom . He piled logs on the fire until it was blazing , boiled water in the kitchen and brewed tea . It seemed to take a long time for her to regain her senses . At last her eyelids fluttered open . She stared up at him blankly . " It 's me , Aunt Ella . Matt . Here , drink this . " He fed her little sips of steaming tea until the blueness left her lips and she was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your uncle ... did you find him ? " " No . Where is he ? " " Smokehouse behind the barn . He has a head wound , and his leg may be broken . " In swift , halting sentences she told Matt what had happened . Uncle Jake had gone out just before the storm began , to put the horses in the barn . One spooked and broke loose , and he chased it into the apple orchard near the smokehouse , where he tripped and fell , twisting his leg and hitting his head . When he did n't come back , Aunt Ella went looking for him . By then he had crawled partway to the smokehouse , but he was dazed and in too much pain to walk . She helped him the rest of the way into the building , then started back to the house for blankets . But the storm had worsened by then and most of her strength was gone . The last thing she remembered was leaning against the barn to rest for a few seconds . Photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was his Aunt Ella , her eyes frozen shut . <p> " I was n't able to wedge the smokehouse door shut all the way , " she told Matt . " Jake 's liable to freeze in there , hurt the way he is , if we do n't get him out soon ! " " I 'll go for him , Aunt Ella . You stay here where it 's warm . " She nodded , shivering. " here 's a sleigh in the barn . We use it for fetching firewood logs . " carrying two heavy wool blankets . Matt once again braved the storm 's fury . He found the sleigh , and dragged it from the barn . Locating the smokehouse took longer . He could feel his own strength ebbing when it finally materialized ahead . Drifts were piled high against the partly open door , but the snow was still powdery enough for him to clear it away with his mittened hands . Uncle Jake lay curled on the floor inside , unconscious but still breathing . Matt was n't sure afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the sleigh , swaddle it in the blankets and haul it outside . The long dragging trek back to the house was another timeless blur . Only fear of his uncle and him freezing to death kept Matt 's tired legs moving through the now-deep drifts . At long last the house lights appeared mistily , and then he was at the door and Aunt Ella was helping him carry Uncle Jake inside . Sinking down before the warmth of the In the morning , when he awoke in the trundle bed , the storm was over and the day before Christmas sparkled silver and white under a pale sun . Every muscle in his body ached , but he felt well enough otherwise . He smelled coffee and frying bacon , and shortly Aunt Ella brought him his breakfast on a tray . Her face glistened with salve applied to patches of frostbite . " Frostbite 's not too bad , " she told him . " You brought me inside just in time . Your Uncle Jake too .

" Aunt Ella sat beside him as he sipped hot coffee . " But do n't you think saving our lives is the only reason . We 've been looking forward to having you here ever since your poor Ma first wrote us about it . " " You have ? But I thought ... I mean , Uncle Jake did n't seem too happy about it in his letters . " " Pshaw . Jake never was any good at putting his true feelings on paper , and I 'm no better . Why , having you live with us will be a joy .

A part of him felt ashamed for his bitter thoughts about the Boyds . Another part felt warm and happy for the first time since Ma 's passing . He had n't just given special holiday gifts , he 'd received some too . A new home and family , and a new appreciation of the season 's spirit . This would be a fine Christmas after all .
