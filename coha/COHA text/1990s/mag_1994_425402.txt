Section : COMPUTE 'S GETTING STARTED WITH(TM) HOME COMPUTING <p> Having a computer at home opens a new world of wonderful software to you , programs your employer would never- allow you to put on the computers at work . Your biggest problems will be picking from the wealth of interesting programs , finding a way to pay for everything you 'd like to buy , and fitting it all onto your hard drive after you bring it home . I ca n't help you with the running-out-of-money problem , but I can give you a quick overview of the kinds of software that are available and pass along some advice . The Year of the Home Computer <p> There 's a lot of excitement for home computing among the giant software developers . Both Microsoft and WordPerfect have established major product lines with scores of products , heavy advertising support , and hopes of getting their products into most of the homes in the country . After all , with over 25 million households ( 27 percent of all homes ) owning computers and 40 percent more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market there waiting to be tapped . <p> Maybe all this attention will make this the year of the home computer . A Basic Home Software Portfolio <p> You 'll need a few basic programs as the core of your home computer 's repertoire . In today 's market , much of what you need will come bundled with the computer . You 'll have a hard time , for example , buying a new computer without Windows already installed along with DOS . Beyond that , software bundles will differ . <p> A works program is offer included in computers aimed for home use . Works programs , such as Microsoft Works , ClarisWorks , and WordPerfect Works ( also referred to as integrated programs ) , combine a basic word processor , spreadsheet , database , communications program , and often a graphics program into a single package . You can do most of the work a typical home needs ( homework , correspondence , light household data tracking ) quite well with these programs . If you did n't get a works program with your computer , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of power for your money , across the spectrum of basic computer tools . ( On the other hand , many of us need our word processors and spreadsheets , for instance , to match up with what we use at work . Be sure to explore the licensing of these programs ; many companies have agreements with the software companies allowing employees to legally make copies for use at home . ) <p> Beyond that , a basic portfolio of software might also include home productivity software , games , school or educational programs , work software brought home , hobby-related programs , home business applications , and communications software in order from most to least frequently used , according to a recent study . Let 's run through a brief overview of the categories we have n't already covered . Productivity Software <p> Aside from the works programs , you 'll find copies of several standard sorts of programs on most home computers . A few programs have been around since the beginning of the DOS era , continually upgraded and as common on home computers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up Software 's excellent Calendar Creator Plus , for example . We 've all seen those omnipresent monthly calendars created by this program-they come with PTA bulletins and church newsletters and are on countless company bulletin boards . The program is currently available in both DOS and Windows versions . <p> Another popular program is Broderbund 's Print Shop Deluxe . The company has sold over 6 million Print Shop products since its introduction years ago . Print Shop makes signs , cards , and banners , and its various companion products add many additional graphics and fancy features , such as text art . Most of us are familiar with the old dotmatrix printer version ; today 's Windows version prints first-class color graphics , laser-quality images , and other high quality graphics . <p> Several million copies of Intuit 's outstanding personal finance program , Quicken , grace home computers . With it or other programs like it , you can control your checkbook , bank cards , and total financial situation . Quicken leads that market because of its single-minded pursuit of ease of use throughout the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information ( The Software Toolworks ' Animals ) to zymurgy ( The Random House Unabridged Dictionary ) . You 'll find drawing programs for creating graphics ( Micrografx 's Windows Draw ) , desktop publishing ( Microsoft Publisher is the current bestseller ) , tax preparation packages ( Meca 's TaxCut for Windows or for DOS ) , home legal helps ( Parsons Technology 's It 's Legal ) , address books ( Power Up 's Address Book Plus ) , language-teaching and translation programs ( Road Scholar 's Spanish Scholar for Windows ) , cookbooks Software 's ( Arion MasterCook 11 ) , gardening programs ( Voudette 's FLOWERscape ) , home building and remodeling design ( Broderbund 's 3D Home Architect ) , genealogy programs ( Banner Blue 's Family Tree Maker for Windows ) , and , of course , the traditional items such as word processors , spreadsheets , and databases of all types and descriptions . The list goes on and on . Utilities <p> Personal productivity programs include the general category of utility programs , which are both popular and necessary . For those with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stacker 4.0 can stuff up to twice as much data as normal onto your drive through a process called disk compression . <p> In addition , you 'll want a virus checker , though you can get an adequate one with DOS 6.21 . LapLink V from Traveling Software comes with a cable that allows you to quickly move data between two computers-used most frequently with laptops , but handy whenever you want to transfer large quantities of data quickly . <p> General utility packages are perennial bestsellers . Symantec 's Norton Utilities 8.0 , Central Point Software 's PC Tools 2.0 for Windows , and PC Tools Pro 9.0 for DOS combine nearly every useful utility known to man into a single package . They provide excellent tools for diagnosing hardware problems , finding and solving hardware and software system conflicts , recovering from and preventing system crashes , and recovering lost or damaged files , You 'll want one of these on hand at all times . <p> Windows users may want to investigate Symantec 's Norton Desktop for Windows 3.0 , a utility that improves on and expands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other utility functions . Hewlett-Packard 's Dashboard provides a nononsense , streamlined Windows interface , <p> Windows users will also want a screen saver . These wonderfully entertaining programs put changing images on your PC 's screen when you have n't been working at the computer for a set time-ostensibly to prevent image burn-in . They 've become incredibly popular over the last two years , spawning dozens of wonderful packages , <p> Of note is Berkeley Systems ' fine After Dark series , which includes the famous flying toasters , a separate set of Star Trek screens with sound , and animated Disney scenes <p> Second Nature Software sells an inexpensive series of 31 fine art sets , ranging from breathtaking photos of mountain splendor to classic aircraft to Monet and Renoir paintings .

Chances are the boss wo n't appreciate Disney or Star Trek scenes at work , so let your spirit of fun run free at home . <p> Windows users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows program can access any TrueType font , printing it in scalable sizes on virtually any printer . Swfte International offers 100 fonts in each of its Typecase 1 , 11 , and III packages , along with a font manager that helps keep the Windows overhead associated with these fonts under control . Ares Software 's Font Chameleon and Altsys 's Font-o-matic let you create your own fonts by altering or combining existing ones . Font-o-matic offers wacky options such as Swiss cheese , cactus , and cow spot effects . Reference Titles <p> Falling under both the personal productivity and the school and educational categories are computerized reference programs . Nowadays , most of these great programs come on CD-ROMs , where vast amounts of storage allow freedom to include massive amounts of data . The three major encyclopedias-Microsoft Encarta , Grolier 's Multimedia Encyclopedia , and Compton 's Interactive Encyclopedia-are good examples . All include sound recordings , full-motion video clips , and thousands of color photos . <p> Of particular note in this category are Random House 's Random House Unabridged Dictionary , Second Edition ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Street Atlas USA 2.0 ( street maps of the entire country ) and Global Explorer ( detailed maps of the entire planet , though not quite down to street level ) , and Microsoft Cinemania ' 94 ( a database of thousands of movies including sound and video clips and thousands of still photos ) . Games <p> I 'm not going to be able to tell you much about games-there are just too many . Even listing the categories would take a full article . Go into any software store and scan the shelves-you 'll see four or five racks of productivity software , lots of computer books , and the rest of the store full of games . <p> Parents , a few cautions are in order . Computer games run the gamut from innocent Mickey Mouse games that teach reading all the way to gory , violent , and ( to some ) disgusting games with little apparent redeeming social value . Most kids go directly to the least desirable programs , so you 'll need to exercise some parental discretion here . <p> If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shooting , killing games turn you against the whole category , Literally hundreds of intriguing puzzle games , card games , and other unclassifiable but delightful games are aimed straight at us mature folks who like a little relaxation now and again . My current favorite is Access Software 's flagship game , Links 386 Pro , which provides gorgeous photorealist golf courses ( Pebble Beach , Firestone , and so on ) to test your talents . School and Educational <p> Reference titles come into play here , as do many games designed to educate children on the sly . MECC 's SuperMunchers games are always popular with the kids and are in most schools . You can count on Davidson &; Associates ' line of games , including its steady bestseller , Math Blaster : In Search of Spot , to be fascinating to the kids . Davidson also provides Your Personal Trainer for the SAT for teenagers preparing for college entrance exams . And Davidson 's Cruncher is , of all things , a powerful Windows spreadsheet for kids , which should open many small-fry eyes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broderbund 's series of exploration programs , including The Playhouse and The Backyard , provides hours of fascination to preschoolers . The company 's fabulously successful Carmen Sandiego series of educational games has even spawned its own television series . The latest incarnation is Where in Space Is Carmen Sandiego ? . <p> Games from The Learning Company provide playful entertainment , subtly delivering educational values . The company 's well-known Reader Rabbit and Math Rabbit games are now available in Windows versions , too . Hobbies <p> If you bowl , help with a scout troop , garden , cook , write poetry , do genealogy , participate in any of a hundred hobbies , or collect coins , stamps , or videos , there 's software available to help you be more effective in pursuing your interests . Unfortunately , you wo n't always find these programs in the software store or advertised by the major mail-order houses . Check your specialty magazines and club publications , and talk to your fellow hobbyists-you 'll find something useful for sure . Communications <p> Using the computer and a modem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major online services provide a rich source of information , computer assistance , news , and other services , as well as making up an electronic community of friends . <p> You 'll need software for this . Some of the online services provide their own software ( Prodigy and America Online , for instance ) ; others work through your standard modem programs . DataStorm Technology 's Procomm Plus is the champion in this arena ; it 's the easiest to use of any of the mainline programs , The Windows version is also excellent . Conclusion <p> There 's no way I can do more than give you a quick survey of the most popular software that 's available . There 's so much out there that you 'll never get to see everything that interests you , but look on the bright side-you 'll never be bored . <p> PHOTO : Organize your personal finances with Quicken for Windows . <p> PHOTO : Bring an encyclopedia into your home with Microsoft Encarta . <p> PHOTO : Explore the U.
