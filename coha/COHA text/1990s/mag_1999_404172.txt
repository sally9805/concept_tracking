WILLIAM AVERY , the latest in Duke 's procession of point guards , shares little in common with his predecessors . But behind his understated demeanor burns an intense , predatory playmaker // The ones who came before , they were crazy , man , they were just crazy . You had stocky Steve Wojciechowsld , playing defense like his room and board depended on it , little legs pumping up and down the court , face red and angry , the effort exacting such a terrible toll on his body that once , after the 1998 ACC championship game , he collapsed in the shower and needed IVs to get going again . You had Bobby Hurley , the holloweyed ghost of a point guard who played 140 feisty games in college , once with an acute attack of diarrhea You had Quin Snyder , the hyper kid from the Pacific Northwest with incredible amounts of energy on the court and off ; after college , he obtained his law degree and his master 's in business . Photograph // And you had Tommy - Amaker , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smothered the intricacies of the position not with athletic ability but with the round-the-clock work habits of a coach , which he became , last season , at Seton Hall . And now , William Avery . He is the latest in the Duke point guard procession , a 6-2 sophomore who outwardly shares little in common with those who came before him , other than the royal blue of his jersey . Maybe that 's why there were so many questions , so many doubts , entering this season about whether the indifferent-looking Avery could run Mike Krzyzewski 's motion offense and be the focal point of Krzyzewski 's bludgeoning , man-to-man defense . " William is ... " Krzyzewski starts , pauses , and finally stops . Then he starts again . " William is a little different than the other kids we 've had at that position . " Avery is the polar opposite of Wojciechowski , the anti-Wojo . Before tipoff , Wojo looked at the opposing point guard like a lion measuring a wounded gazelle . Avery does n't look at the other point guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight shifting from foot to foot , looking at his shirt as if there might be lint on it . The mechanical Wojo performed every task-every dribble , every defensive stance-with muscles flexed and sweat flying . Avery is so sleepy smooth , he looks relaxed even as he is covering more ground on defense and getting into the lane faster on offense than any of his predecessors did . But the questions ? Oh , there were questions . With Wojciechowski gone but eight former high school AllAmericans returning from last season 's 32-4 , Elite Eight team , Avery appeared to be the only potential roadblock between the Blue Devils and the 1999 Final Four . Could Avery , more of a scorer than a playmaker last season , rein in his offense enough to get everyone else involved ? Could he curtail his occasionally futile forays into the lane , which often ended in a missed shot or a charging call , sometimes both ? Could he do everything he would be asked to do on offense , and still have enough left for 94 feet of man-toman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he needed to learn to play more under control , " Duke senior guard Trajan Langdon says . " Nobody really knew what William was going to do . No , let me take that back . William knew what he was going to do . " Not really . The assists , yes ; Avery knew he 'd get the assists . And the shooting , yes ; Avery knew he 'd shoot this well . But this often ? On a team with preseason All-Americans Langdon and Elton Brand ? " If you 'd told me I was going to score almost 15 a game , I 'd have been like , " I do n't know , I have two players-of-the-year candidates . I 've got to get them the ball , ' Avery says . " I did n't think there 'd be this many shots for me . " There has been enough for everybody . Langdon and Brand see-sawed for the ACC scoring lead throughout the season , literally exchanging it on a shot-by-shot basis during a game at Virginia , and Brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Langdon was fourth , behind Georgia Tech 's Jason Collier and Clemson 's Terrell McIntyre , at 17.4 ) . Photograph POINT OF VIEW : Avery ( left ) averaged 14.6 points and assisted Brand in winning the ACC scoring title . // To all that offense , Avery has added 14.6 points a game and 5.5 assists . He has shot 49.2 percent from the field , 40 percent on 3pointers and 81 percent from the foul line . Often impatient on offense as a freshman , when he averaged 8.5 points but shot only 29.6 percent on 3-pointers and averaged one turnover for every 1.45 assists , Avery this season has been a model of self-control . His 2.25-to-1 ratio of assists to turnovers is third in the ACC . " They 've had a lot of great point guards over there at Duke , " Maryland coach Gary Williams says . " And Avery certainly fits in well with all of them . " Maybe better than that . Wojciechowski was more of a hound dog on defense , but he never scored like Avery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for assists was his junior year , when he averaged 5.3 per game . Snyder and Amaker matched Avery in the assist category , but neither scored at such a clip . Hurley did it all-he is the NCAA career leader with 1,076 assists and he scored 1,731 points , 14th on the Duke chartsbut even Hurley did n't match Avery 's current scoring average until his senior year , when he averaged 17 points after three previous seasons of 8.8 , 11.3 and 13.2 . " William 's one of the better point guards in the country , " Krzyzewski says . " I have to admit , he 's surprised me with how far he 's come in one year . I knew he 'd be a key player for us , a starter , but I did n't see him having this kind of success so soon . He 's become a great player . " Not everyone is a believer . Earlier this season , North Carolina senior forward Ademola Okulaja said he 'd take his point guard , junior Ed Cota , over Avery " 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watered down a few compliments of Avery by questioning his quickness and suggesting that the high quality of Avery 's supporting cast eased his transition from reserve to starter . " He 's got two of the best players in the country ( Brand and Langdon ) to pass it to , " Cota said . " He should have a lot of assists . " Cota was more gracious after Duke 's 81-61 expulsion of the Tar Heels on February 27 , when Avery outscored him , 24-12 . " He 's a great point guard , " Cota said . Coming into that night , Avery had averaged 10.3 points over the previous four games . In the days leading up to the North Carolina game , Krzyzewski devoted extra practice time to getting Avery more shots , telling his point guard to be more selfish . " It shows how good a kid William is , because the thing he 's supposed to do well-shoot-he had n't done that much , " Krzyzewski says . " William had been focusing so much on running the team that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is remarkable . " The spoils of this season have had a dizzying effect on Avery , who , a year ago , could n't break into the starting lineup for a single game and now is contemplating coming out for the 1999 NBA draft . Krzyzewski never has had a player leave school early for the NBA-not Grant Hill , not Christian Laettner , not anybody-and the assumption in October was that if the streak were to end , it would end with Brand , the 6-8 , 260-pound monster forward . Instead , Avery has put enough thought into it to know where he will draw the line between staying in school or turning pro . " If I 'm going to be a lottery pick , I think I 'd have to do it , " Avery says . " That kind of deal would be hard to turn your back on . I know I 'm going to have a decision to make . I just hope I make the right one . " This basketball odyssey began on a sheet of red clay in Augusta Ga. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back yard . When the weather turned , rain rotted the wood backboard and turned the court into mush . " When it rained , there 'd be mud for five days . I think it helped my ballhandling a lot , because I was out there dribbling around all that stuff , " Avery says . " Then I 'd go out there and shoot it and try to run and get the ball before it fell in a water puddle . It really helped me follow my shot . " Ask Clemson . At the 1998 ACC tournament , the fifth-seeded Tigers played No. 1 Duke to a 64-64 draw with 7.8 seconds remaining . Avery took the inbounds pass , darted up the court and let go a running jumper from the left side over the 5-9 McIntyre . While everyone else watched the shot , Avery kept on running to the rim , where he caught his rebound in midair and in one motion laid it into the basket with three-tenths of a second left for the victory . " It was like I was in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let the ball get all muddy . " Avery was 8 when he launched the shot that tore the rim from that decaying backboard behind his grandmother 's house . Avery contends it was no brick- " I made the shot , " he says-but with the rim lying on the ground , it was time to move on . Avery found himself a spot a few blocks away , at a park where the grown-ups played . " I was a natural scorer , " he says . " Even then . I was n't scared of anybody . I knew I could dribble , and I knew I could shoot " The park was the place Avery learned how to shoot off the dribble , using his quickness to separate from bigger players , then shooting before they could recover . The park also was the place where he learned to keep his mouth shut , to defer to his elders , to get knocked flat by a moving screen , leave some serious epidermis on the pavement and get up quiet but ready for more . Photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Avery , who , a year ago , could n't break into the starting lineup for a single game and now is contemplating coming out for the 1999 NBA draft . // Avery never has been a talker . Even at Westside High in Augusta , where he was dubbed " The Truth " by a local broadcaster as a ninth-grader and went on to score more than 1,900 points in three years , Avery was stone quiet on the court . He stayed that way at Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson , Va , where he spent his senior season improving his academics to qualify for admission into Duke , and quiet he is to this day . One of the most assertive things he ever said came during his junior year of high school , when he visited Duke , was told by Krzyzewski he did n't have the academic work habits to get into school , walked out of Krzyzewski 's office and told his mother , " I 'm going to Duke . " " It 's a big change from Wojo , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real take-charge guy , real vocal , and William is so quiet . Sometimes he goes an entire game and I wo n't hear his voice . But you know he 's there , and he 's making plenty ot noise in his own way . " Nobody calls Avery " The Truth " any more , but he liked the Augusta handle so much he had it burned onto his right biceps . The tattoo almost blends into his arm , not jumping off his arm and into your eyes like teammate Corey Maggette 's tattoo-a picture of a wizard spinning basketballs on his fingers . But that 's Avery . What he does , even when it 's something as overstated as a tattoo , he does in his understated way . " People do n't have to growl to be intense , " Krzyzewski says . " William 's had a great year , you know , and he would n't have had a great year if he were n't intense . Do n't be fooled by his look . He 's a terrific competitor . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks as if he could stop his dribble , pass to Brand for a dunk , and take a nap under the basket . To the other team , he gives nothing to build on , nothing to get fired up about , nothing at all . He does n't say a word to an opposing player during a game , and he wo n't even look at one beforehand . " I never look over there at them warming up , because if they see me look , they 're thinking , Oh , man , he 's watching me , he 's worrying about me . ' So that guy gains confidence , " Avery says . " Our whole team has that attitude . When we 're warming up , we do n't look at the other team . But if we find out they 're looking at us , we 're like , They 're not ready to play . We 're going to crush them . ' " Avery cracks a smile and offers something so predatory , it sounds like something that would make Wojo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yeah , " he says , " I want to crush every team we play .
