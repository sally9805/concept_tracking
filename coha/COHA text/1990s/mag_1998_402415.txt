Our brothers and sisters are made of the same clay we are . That is why we can hit them , hate them - and never really lose them . Insights on family from Pulitzer prize-winning writer Anna Quindlen , with photographs by Nick Kelsh. // The most vivid emotion of my childhood , at least in memory , is my hatred of my brother Bob . Truth is , the word hatred , simple and powerful as a punch to the gut , does not even begin to cover what I remember feeling . A virtual rainbow of contempt , loathing , disdain-that is how I remember my life with my brother from the time he arrived , cradled in my mother 's arms , when I was little more than a year old . TI here is something so pure and uncompromising in the feeling , like the taste of a lemon or the prick of a thorn , that it 's almost pleasurable to think of it today , in a world where I have learned to shave off the sharper edges of experience , to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , how I hated him . I can only tell this story because I now love my brother as fiercely as I once loathed him . This is not because we are alike , although we 're both gregarious and inward in some strange dichotomous way . I like to think Bob is the person I would have been had I come second , he first-although , of course , that would have changed everything for both of us. le is unpretentious , generous , good-hearted , but nobody 's fool . He 's also ironic , funny , and moe king with just the right edge of kidding to it . He runs a day-care center and wears an earring . You would like him ; everyone does . I have two other brothers , Mike and Kevin , with whom I have had relationships different from , in truth much less close than , the one I have with Bob . There is often a kind of domino theory to sibling relationships : The more powerful bond , for good or ill , is usually made with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brothers and I all feel particularly close to Theresa , who is the youngest . But I have a special relationship with Bob because he is able to validate my history simply by existing . lie and I witnessed together what childhood was like in our household . II lie shared the rooms , meals , mischief , and especially the mother and the father . Which is why I hated him so in the beginning . I DO N'T UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE learn to live in the world if they have n't had siblings . If those who are only children recoil from that sentence , I can only beg pardon and plead the myopia of one who , until she 'd graduated from college , ca n't recall being alone in the house . Everything I learned about negotiation , territoriality , coexistence , dislike , and love , I learned from these four : Bob , like , Kevin , Theresa . In some essential way , they were my universe , even more than my parents . For while we might pretend to be what our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our siblings day after day , year after year , without thinking much about it . We share real life with them . We see them naked , in every sense of the word . Sometimes , when I was in my 20s , my friends would report meeting a man with whom they could be so intimate that they admitted him into the most grimy details of daily existence . This was a man who could see you sick , watch you cry , and even share your bathroom . This man might someday be your husband . Well , I 've been that intimate with my husband , but I 'd been that intimate and a million times more with my brothers and sister for many years . The boys barged into the bathroom when I was in the tub ; I 'd surprised them on the living room couch when they were prone with their girlfriends ; I changed my sister 's diapers , made her school lunches , told her what books to read , and filled her in on menstruation and birth control . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " They 're all you 'll have someday , " my mother used to say when we children would bicker , fight , or strike one another , as we did with some fre ( lency . I always thought there was something pathetic in the way she 'd say that , as though our siblings would be the sad leftovers on the plate of life . But now , as I say it to my own three children , I realize she meant something quite different . And I remember what I felt deep in my bones when I was pregnant with my third child : that she was a lucky person because we 'd had the foresight to provide her with two brothers , who , in the natural order of things , would still be part of her life after we were gone . The greatest gift I believe I 've given my children is one another . HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DESCRIBE THE commonplace bonds of blood . But we begin to understand when we remember the moments with our siblings , not the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is when I think of pushing Theresa around our suburban neighborhood in her stroller , or remember running faster than I ever had before , my lungs bursting , to tell my mother that Kevin had pulled a cement flowerpot down onto his leg . It is when I remember listening to Mike , a baby with beautiful blond curls , in his crib . It is when I remember shooting across the living room with Bob behind me , to throw myself into a chair and raise my flying feet to meet his fists . Photograph Photograph // Or maybe I find it in a photograph of Bob , Mike , and me taken when we were all under 6 , still smooth , unmarked , and unknowing . The photographer had placed us in a classic pose : Bob sitting between my knees , Mike between his-a sibling train . We are like matrioshka dolls , one inside the other . There is a sense of connection as powerful as a rope or those chains around the ankles that convicts wear when they 're shuttled to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . You can pick your nose , as one of my kids once told me , but you ca n't pick your family . Yet they are me . I am them . I say that now knowing how different we are and that , sometimes , we have been estranged , angry , uncaring . But I suppose that is part of it too . It is easier to be cavalier when there is a bond that can never be broken . " Flesh of my flesh , " they say sometimes in the marriage ceremony , but it 's just not true . It 's not even true of our children , who are part us , but not made of what we are made of . But our brothers and sisters : Well , it is all the same clay . That is why we can hit them , hate them , and never really lose them-or we have lost our history , a part of ourselves . It is a bond as old as humanity . In 1785 , a girl named Jane Austen was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because her parents thought her ready , but because she demanded to go where her older sister led . " If Cassandra 's head had been going to he cut off , " their mother said , " Jane would insist on having hers cut off too . " The little girl would go on to write some of the finest prose about sisterhood that has ever been produced . And why not ? She knew it from cradle to grave . After she was dead , her sister burned almost all the letters that had passed between them . After all , they could tell each other anything and probably did . Which is not to say the sibling relationship is straightforward . In fact , it may be one of the most complex connections we ever know . My children all have loved a book about sibling rivalry called Julius , the Baby of the World by Kevin Henkes . It is about a little girl named Lilly ( well , actually she 's a mouse , but she lo ) ks like a little girl ) who acquires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best part-Lilly writes a story alx ) ut Julius : Julius was really a germ . Julius was like dust under your bed . If he was a number , he would be zero . If he was a food , he would be a raisin . Zero is nothing . A raisin tastes like dirt . The End Well , anyone who has had a younger brother or sister knows exactly how Lilly feels , and exactly how this story is going to turn out , and so did my kids . Because when someone else makes fun of Julius , Lilly gets all cold , dark , and mean , and makes the malefactor repeat these words loudly : Julius is the baby of the world . And that is the way it is . My children live it , every day . While my son Christ ( r pher allows himself to call his brother Quin a " macho creep , " or Quin to call Maria " you baby , " or Maria to call ( Christopher " big stupid , " no one else is permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're talking to ? " one of the boys will say to another kid who insults his sister . And the answer is implicit : My sister : Mine . Listen to that possessive pronoun . Of course , it 's not as simple as that . The feelings of the stronger toward the weaker , the elder toward the younger , are never simple . And overall , there remains one irrefutable fact : Each has what the other wants exclusively-the love of their parents . In Henkes 's hook , lilly 's parents understand this . They showered her with hgs and kisses and treats of all shapes and sizes . .. It did n't matter : Nothing worked . Well , of course it did n't . It means something that in Dr. Spock 's Baby and Child Care , the only mention of siblings is in connection with jealousy and rivalry . Penelope Leach , in one of her childcare books , described this phenomenon best : Suppose one day your husband comes home and says that he is about to acquire a new wife . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care and attention . But this does not mean he loves you any less . Well , it does make the ground rules of the relationship quite vivid , does n't it ? Each time my mother went to the hospital in the middle of the night , I remember thinking : Less for me . My father did his best while she was gone , but the school lunches were badly made and the dinners were haphazard . And then our mother was home with someone small and clearly in need of intensive care . Less for me . Just ... less . Photograph // And yet , without knowing it , I was getting more , learning about human relationships and the amazing variety of character and response . Incredibly enough , my college psychology text has only a single reference to the sibling relationship . It reads : " lore than eighty percent of American children have siblings . In the child 's interaction with them , he may learn patterns of loyalty , helpfulness , and protection ; or of conflict , domination , and competition-and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my kids like to say , " Duh . " Virtually all the rest of the material in this section of the book is about the eldest child , which younger siblings would tell you , wryly , bitterly , is just abo ( lt the way the book of life is written too . IN SITCOMS , MOVIES , COMICS , AND CARtoons , the sibling relationship is often portrayed as just one practical joke after another . Torture , mental and physical , is a recurrent theme : biting , kicking , telling friends about the night your brother had the dream about going to the bathroom and actually-well , you know . But that is the easy part , the surface manifestation of what it means to live in a house with other people related by blood and by their equal right to the towels , sofa , and Oreos . The hard part , the deeply individual part , is the alchemy What is it like to be the younger boy if your older brother is a gifted athlete ? What is it like to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the other just like Dad , and you are-well , just like you ? If we are so clearly defined by our childhoods , how can we help but define ourselves except in terms of what our sisters and brothers are ? How much of our character is essential , how much a reaction against the family mythology that assigns roles ? You are the good child , the clown , the little lady , the troublemaker . The family is a country from which it is impossible to escape when we are young . It creates a place for each of us , whether we like it or not . My husband is the eldest of six hoys , and one of his brothers once told me that the rest of them Il had a clear sense of where his future lay : " either pope or president . " I am the eldest of five , and when my brother Bob heard that , he laughed . " You two were made for each other , " he said . So Bob established his persona partly in opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on . Our families are like houses ; you get the room that is not yet filled . Sometimes it is a narrow one . Inevitably , you think someone else has gotten a better deal . Nly second child has a one-word clarion cry whenever he feels put upon . " Favoritism , " he intones , almost as though the word were set to music . " Favoritism ! " If I am Mother Earth to my children , and they are my competing moons , then a good bit of their relationship with one another consists of grievances . " He got to ... You always let her ... She never gets in trouble when ... I always have to ... " There is some truth in these grievances as well , since each child in a family gets a different set of parents-different in age , experience , and position at the time of the child 's birth . By the time our third child was born , I did n't sweat the small stuff , which sometimes meant I missed the little moments . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older brothers . Ask her and she will tell you that they are the bane of her existence , and in many ways she is right . Here , for example , is some representative dialogue from a short ride in our car : " I like this song . " Loud sigh from the backseat . " Maria , this song is so stupid . It sounds like their last song . " " I liked their last song too . " Loud sigh from the backseat . Ten bars of music . Another sigh . " Can we change this ? " " No , I like this song . You guys always get to listen to what you want . " Snort from the backseat . " You listened to this same song yesterday in the car . " " No , I did n't . " " And it 's such a stupid song . " Another sigh . Maria bursts into tears . " You always make fun of my music . " " Maria , you do n't have to cry about everything .... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is wrong with this scenario if you are Maria . She is too young to have the vast perspective on popular music that her older brother had at the time of this conversation , nor is she experienced enough to have learned the tricks of tWisting a discussion to her advantage . Raw emotion is her tool of choice , which she understands intuitively is useful but secondrate She would prefer the bon mot , but each time she gets a handle on more sophisticated repartee , the other two have done so as well . She 's in no position to know this will continue until sometime after 18 , when age becomes less important than experience , and she will do and experience things that will impress and educate her brothers . There is a cartoon by Gary I , arson showing two small octopi in the backseat of a car with their parents . The caption reads : He 's touching me ! He 's touching me ! It is the work of a man who grew up with a brother ; it speaks to all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that conversation in the car , and you can see much of what makes the sibling relationship so powertill and so important . Beneath the bickering is something unusual and valuable in human intercourse : little pretense , posturing , or false politeness . These three are direct in a way they are with few others rlhey have known each other , literally , since the day they were born . They have shared beds , breakfasts , heartbreaks . The masks we assume throughout our lives fall before the weight of so much everydayness . With one another , my children will learn how to be themselves for other people , at least for those they love , live with , and truly trust . Family life is a laboratory , in which to experiment with living . The boys learn that bullying may give them a momentary feeling of power but will not yield the desired result , Which is to change the radio station . They learn that the tears of others make them uncomfortable and force them to soften their hard line . And Maria discovers herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both a result , I think , of her relationship with her brothers . There are families in which the jockeying for position continues well past the **34;0;TOOLONG stage , when grown men are still trying to prove which brother is smarter , stronger , better . But most of the time that evaporates as the years go by and all that is left are memories-and love . But it is not a love like most others . I suppose it is like the way I love a little china dish on my dresser in which I leave my earrings every night . It 's pretty , perfectly shaped , and I scarcely look at it most of the time . But if it were not there , I would be off-kilter . I am used to it . And that 's how it is with my brothers and sister . " I here have been times when lCS WIl I have not seen or talked to them for months , but I 've been a sister longer than I 've been almost anything else in my life . Here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with almost the same amount of gray in our hair , having a comfortable conversation , and it suddenly occurs to me : He is the only person I have ever beaten up . More than once too . Two of my brothers-in-law were talking the other day of how they once came to blows , and their father came between them , repeating , " Brothers do n't fight . Brothers do n't fight . " I loved my fatherin-law , but here 's my response to that particular piece of family wisdom : " Ihe hell they do n't . Of course , I hit Bob . Of course , I could . He is my brother . That explains everything . If he were anyone else I once hated so much , I would n't know him today . But he is n't anyone else . And I know what our mother meant now : We are all we have left . So much of our past life is gone . Strangers live in our former houses ; we no longer see the schools ; our mother is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as artifacts . But in each other , Bob and I remember where we have been , who we are . T here is a little boy inside the man who is my brother , a little boy with thick glasses , bright blue eyes , a brush cut , and a squint . Oh , how I hated that little boy . And how I love him too . <p>
