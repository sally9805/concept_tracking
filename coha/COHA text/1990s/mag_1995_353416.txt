My computer does n't work . If you own a computer , I 'm sure this admission does n't surprise you . This morning , for instance , I powered up my new , $3,000 machine , hoping to check my E-mail . I launched ( an optimistic verb ) a communications program , and double-clicked an on-screen button . <P> The button refused to respond . I could n't get my E-mail . When my computer does n't work , I engage in a few modern rituals . I turn it off , then on again  --  the equivalent of throwing a cup of cold water in its face . Or I try starting it while holding down the shift key ; that secret handshake tells my computer to load only its most essential programs . Then , I add the one I need , hoping it wo n't crash my system . I 've found that rapping my machine smartly on its side never cures the problem . It does , however , precipitate a brief but gratifying starburst pattern on the monitor , much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My behavior is within the normal range of human-computer interactions . I know an editor at a computer magazine who treats his machine as if it were organic , a delicate ecology of microchips and electric pulsing code . He 's put a word-processing program and some bland communications software on it . Nothing more . While every new , cool program comes to him ( laser-'em-up games , flight sims , goofy utilities that promise to make his computer bark like a Schnauzer ) , he refuses to put any of them on his hard drive for fear that doing so would expose it to grave biological risk . <P> We 're not stupid and neither are you . It 's 1995 and we 're no longer technological naifs . Many of us do n't need how-to books like Windows for Dummies or Macs for Dummies because we 've been using ( or trying to use ) computers for more than 15 years . We neither fear them , nor want them to go away . When they work , they help organize our thoughts and simplify our lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smartly on their sides . Repeatedly . Until the nurse comes and leads us to a quiet room . <P> The problem is not in us , it 's in our computers . And I am fed up . I do n't want to have to deal with software conflicts and bugs and crashes anymore . I do n't want to waste another second waiting at the checkout counter of the grocery store because the cash-machine network is down . I want to be online , not on line . Most of all , I want to read my E-mail without having to sacrifice a tethered goat . <P> So I offer a modest proposal : Let Bill Gates rule the digital world . <P> Gates does n't control too much , he controls too little . Encourage him to finish building his monopoly . Let him manage the flow of bits end-to-end , from the boxes that sit on our desktops to the servers that run mighty networks . Let him provide the digital dial tone for the information superhighway . Look the other way while Microsoft gobbles up cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipeline into every home . Ignore it when Gates colonizes Hollywood and starts running the film and TV industry . Give him Intuit . And throw in the banks too .
