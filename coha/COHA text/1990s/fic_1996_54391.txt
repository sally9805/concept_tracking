" Chasing Butterfly Shadow " is the first of two stories we have from novelist Nancy Springer . Nancy has published nearly two dozen novels , and countless short stories . She has won a Joan Fassler Memorial Book award for her children 's book , Colt . About this story , she writes , " In my experience , very old people , like very young children , are cognitive aliens to the rest of us . I think this is not because they are ' losing it ' but because they are on their way out a here , one foot in another world . ' Chasing Butterfly Shadow ' is my attempt to depict a very old woman 's different view of everyday experience . " <p> When Nona goes out to get the mail , she takes the new dog with her , letting him run . He is a little thing , a sheltie , not a Lassie look-alike but just another brown hairy . oblong , jaws worthy of a moray eel at one end , tail out of control at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cute , but when the people from the cinder-block church on the highway came knocking last night he turned all teeth and snarl . Nona held him back by the collar and let him speak for her . After the tract pushers went away she said , " Your mama raised you right , dog , " and patted him and smiled for an hour . She has never liked tract pushers , trying to shove their religion down everybody 's throat <p> The mail is waiting in the box out by the road , a quarter-mile away . It will take Nona an hour to get there and back , but she does not mind . She has stayed thin and healthy , and she looks forward to the walk . That sort of thing is what keeps you going when you are ninety-five years old . <p> In the sandy front yard , between the twin palmettos , the big azalea bush is in full coral-pink bloom . Nona slowfoots toward it . The dog , who does not care about azaleas , busies himself sending a squirrel back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine forest behind the house . But Nona peers ahead , perceiving an aureole of movement around the azalea and intimations of blue and yellow amid its glory of pink . When she reaches it she comprehends : the azalea is alive with butterflies , dozens of them . <p> " Dog , you got to see this ! " Nona calls . <p> He comes running . Nona 's son Bill did not want her to get another dog because of the expense , but when her friend Maisie called her from the pound and told her this one was going begging , she was n't about to say no . It is Billy 's problem if he worries too much about money . Her husband was the same way when he was alive , and that is why he paid the piper before he had to , she is sure of it . The man was penny wise and pound foolish . He let money run his life , never understanding there were things above and beyond . <p> Nona stands by the azalea studying the butterflies coming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swallowtails and Red Admirals and others she does n't know , one kind velvet black with a blue fringe , another sort tawny with white leopard spots . The dog bounces up to her , then rears like a pony with excitement . In the strong Florida sunshine , shadows of butterflies on the wing scud sharp and dark across the sand . The dog pounces on a flitting shadow with both forepaws , then jumps after it as it glides on , unaffected . His series of leaps follow the butterfly shadow across the yard until he loses it in the shade under the huge gray-mossed oak tree . <p> " Here ! " Nona complains . " You never saw what I called you for . " <p> He runs panting back to her , but immediately finds another shadow to chase , Pogo-stick fashion , across the yard . His spring-loaded zigzags make him appear more like a wind-up toy than the watchdog he is . Nona shakes her head at him . <p> " It ai n't like that 's a mouse or a rat , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you caught it ? It ai n't real . " <p> It is real enough to satisfy him . Nona walks on , heading toward her mailbox , but the dog remains behind , intent on chasing butterfly shadows . <p> The walk is long and slow but not hard . Most of the time Nona 's lane lies under pine forest , so she is not out in the heat and glare . At the roadside , though , the sun beats down . Back in her yard , now , it will be making the azalea blaze like fire , like the burning bush of Moses , and the butterflies will be going up like sparks into the sky . Nona has trouble with the catch on the mailbox , but eventually conquers it . The contents are worth her effort : a Fingerhut catalog , a Carol Wright coupon packet , and a bright red-white-and-blue envelope that declares , " You Have Been Selected for Grand Prize Eligibility . " When Nona 's daughter , Lois , gets the mail , there is never anything good in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the interesting things and hides them under her car seat before she drives back up the lane . She has never asked , and certainly she will not go open Lois 's car and look , but she feels sure this is true . There has been no good mail since the day the Visa bill came and Lois saw it and was aghast and cried out like somebody snakebit . <p> " Six thousand dollars , Mother ! " <p> " It is just money , " Nona said . <p> " Just money ! Why , Mother , do n't you realize , you could be paying on that forever and never get anywhere ! " <p> Nona does not care . " Forever " takes on a different meaning when you are ninety-five , when each day is a pearl strung on a necklace that has its ends way out of sight , up in eternity somewhere . <p> Anyway , Lois is away today , and Nona has gotten the mail by herself , and feels exalted . She walks back to the house , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the sunny spots in the lane and out of her way . When she gets home , clouds have come out of somewhere and covered the sun . No more butterfly shadows . The dog is sitting by her front door like a locked-out child . <p> Nona lets him in , lays her mail on the kitchen table to be enjoyed over lunch , and finds the big butterfly book . It is getting old , like her . Its green cloth cover is frayed , but its color plates are as bright as ever . She opens it and almost immediately identifies the leopard-spotted butterfly as a Gulf Fritillary , but then forgets to look up the elegant black one with blue borders . Her researches stray to the tropical butterflies with their iridescent colors , their strangely shaped wings . There are pictures of butterflies from Burma , Paraguay , the Solomon Islands , the Ivory Coast , Ceylon . Faraway places . <p> She will clear the owl figurines off the mantel , she decides . Owls are not so wise . Probably they worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start collecting porcelain butterflies , if there is such a thing . Perhaps the Franklin Mint has something . It does not have to be the actual butterflies . It can be butterfly vases , or mugs , or prints . <p> Not quite accidentally Nona leaves the butterfly book lying out and open . She is feeling just a little weightless , lightheaded  --  it must be time for something . Lunch , that 's what . Lunch , and her mail . She makes her way into the kitchen , where she microwaves herself Cup-A-Soup . When she sits , the dog lies at her feet and does not pester to be fed . He has good manners . Strange that such a nice dog should end up at the pound . <p> As Nona eats she opens the brightly colored envelope , looks at its brochure  --  turquoise-blue Caribbean seas , an Aztec festival in Mexico  --  and sends off her Grand Prize Entry at once , sticking her tokens on squares that say " Five-Piece Cordovan Luggage Set " and " World of Wonders Encyclopedia " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she tried to use the Visa she was told it was full . She seals the envelope and stamps it from the postage supply she keeps on the table right along with the sugar . The great-grandchildren are coming over this afternoon , and they will be glad to mail it for her and not tattle to the adults . <p> She opens the lovely parcel-brown Carol Wright envelope and looks through the offers . A 1248 Piece Personalized Stationery Set , only $7.95 . Nona has never understood why they call it that , stationery . It 's like writing letters means you 're not going anywhere . Limited Edition Endangered Species Decorator Plates  --  they are nice , but they are not butterflies . She is looking for butterflies . Lose Weight Overnight Vitamin E Nighttime Diet  --  she does not need that , she has always been thin enough to blow away . Cascade Dishwashing Detergent For Spotless Dishes Sweepstakes She is just about to read the Easy Directions , Enter Now , No Purchase Required , when she sees on the next page : Breakthrough In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now that is something worthwhile . When she was a youngster , which somehow seems closer all the time instead of farther away , the only way to go anywhere was by horse and buggy , Heaven was the half-day trip to the county seat for the Fourth of July , and all the glory was yet to come , the automobiles and paved roads , radio and television , the great airships , trips into space . But now they can bounce signals off artificial stars  --  at least they look like wandering stars overhead at night , because she saw one once , Bill showed her , and that was what it was like , a spark of light moving through the sky . And now they can send brightwing pictures from the far side of the world straight to her house . She wants to be linked to the stars and the sky , part of whatever is big and far away . At once she writes out a check , seals and stamps its envelope and puts it in the napkin holder with the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandchildren . She will have to look at the Fingerhut catalog later . For now , she slides it under the corduroy seat cushion of a kitchen chair , where nobody is likely to notice it . <p> She hears the station wagon drive in . The dog jumps up . " Now , you do n't have to bark , " she tells him . " These people are family . " <p> He barks a little anyhow , but not the way he did at the tract pushers yesterday . Bill walks past him with a sour look , but the children become loud and happy . <p> " What 's his name ? " <p> " Grammaw , can we walk him ? " <p> She makes them wait till Bill is gone , then gives them the letters to mail . They go off with the dog on a leash , as she is not sure he will come when they call him if he gets distracted in the woods , and he might not know his way home yet . Next time they can let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a pen or on a leash or a chain . Things were meant to be free . <p> " Hey , Gram . " It is the oldest one , the teenager , who has stayed behind to separate himself from the little kids . " Did you hear the one about the dyslexic atheist ? He did n't believe in Dog . " <p> " That 's not nice , " she tells him . In fact she does not understand his joke , but she would not have laughed anyway . Seems like she 's on a different wavelength than most people these days . Hardly anything anybody can say makes her laugh aloud anymore . <p> She puts the teenager to work packing away porcelain owls . He is still grumpily at it when the other children get back , their bluejay voices flying in the windows long before they come m the door . <p> " Grammaw , this dog is stupid ! " <p> " Grammaw , you know what your new dog did ? He tried to fight Bubha ! " <p> She hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Doberman pinscher , of how the children had to drag the sheltie away so he would not get himself hurt . <p> " He 's not stupid , " she tells them stiffly when they are done . " He 's just full of piss and vinegar . " <p> " He acts dumb ! He wants to chase cars . " <p> " He wants to chase everything ! " <p> The dog , freed from the leash and stimulated by the commotion , demonstrates by whirling after his own wayward tail . The children laugh , but Nona cuts them short . <p> " Go look at my azalea , " she tells them . " It 's loaded with butterflies . " <p> They run out , and so does the dog . The sky is still clouded over , but in a few moments it clears , the sun starts to shine again , and Nona hears the children shouting " Grammaw ! Come out , you got to see this ! " <p> " I know what he 's doing , " she mutters into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Grammaw ! You sure this dog came complete with a brain ? " <p> " Yeah ! Maybe he was Some Assembly Required  --  " <p> "  --  and they forgot to put one in . " <p> Suddenly the dog starts to bark as if the tract pushers are coming back again , and Nona gets up from her owl packing and goes out as quickly as she can , which is not very , not at her age . But the children have things well in hand . One of them is holding the dog by the collar , and he is snarling and Lois is there , getting out of her cute little car . It is no wonder the dog is raging at her . There is anger all around her like a dark halo . She carries two envelopes in her hand . <p> " Mother , " she says , " what in the world are you thinking of ? After all you 've spent already . What do I have to say to make you listen ? You 've gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not made of money . How do you expect us ever to pay off the charges you 're running up ? " <p> Lois has hardly raised her voice , and she does not swear , not ever . Nona raised her right . But she is scolding her mother in front of the children , and she has never done that before . <p> Nona keeps her head up . " Those envelopes are supposed to be in the mail , " she tells her daughter . " What are you doing taking mail out of my mailbox ? " <p> " I thought I 'd stop on my way home and bring you your mail , that 's what . And then I find these . Mother , you just ca n't . Do n't you remember all the so-called prizes you 've sent for already ? Hundreds of dollars wasted . Thousands , by the time we get done paying . " She holds up the other envelope . " And what 's this for ? " <p> " An indoor TV antenna . " That is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the glory of the thing , but Nona is rattled . The way the dog is carrying on shows how furious Lois really is . Nona never realized before . <p> Lois cries , " A TV antenna ? What possessed you ? You have a perfectly good antenna already . " <p> " Oh , rip them up if you want , " Nona says , jerking her chin at the envelopes . " It does n't matter . " This is probably true . In the long view , the sky view , it probably does not matter at all . <p> " It matters that you  --  would somebody please get that dog out of here ? " Lois waits until the children comply , taking refuge in the house . Then she goes on more quietly . " It matters that you do n't seem to under , and about your situation . Mother , I do n't know what to do with you . You 're healthy , I know you want to keep living in your own home , but how can you if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you be so sharp about everything else and so dense about money ? " <p> She sails into the house , calls Bill , arranges to take the children home to save him a trip . " I will pick up your mail tomorrow , " she tells Nona as she leaves . After everyone is gone , Nona hears the silence ringing like great soundless bells . <p> She ought to put the owls back on the mantel , but does not . Instead she speaks to the dog , who waggles his ears attentively at her . Lord only knows what he is thinking , but that does n't mean he is dumb . It is just that his thoughts run in ways that are strange to her . " You are not stupid , " she tells him . " Do n't listen to them . " <p> The house seems dark and small to Nona . She goes outside for a little walk , taking the dog with her . He darts straight to the azalea bush , and much more slowly she follows . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low , the butterflies are sated , they fly sluggishly if at all , and their shadows on the sand are dim . One hazy skimming shape goes past ; the dog pounces on it and springs after it a short distance , then comes back . He stands with ears quivering and pricked so high they nearly touch , waiting for another . The azalea bush glows like sunset , and the butterflies rest in its cloudy softness , slowly fanning their delectable wings . They are southern ladies in church , Nona decides , souls rocking in the bosom of Abraham . <p> The dog waits . No shadows skitter across the sand . Time passes , minutes collecting on God 's necklace . The dog barks impatiently , then springs . Straight at a swallowtail on a lower branch he launches himself , snapping with those piss-and-vinegar jaws of his , jumping it to make it fly . <p> Nona does not mind that he then chases the shadow instead of the thing itself . She is laughing out loud , and trying to leap into the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands like the noisy clapping wings of a dove , because her dog is wise as angels . He knows . He knows what is real . He knows where the stars wander , he knows the color of glory , he knows how to qualify for the grand prize . He knows that above the butterfly shadow flies the butterfly . <p> <p> By Nancy Springer <p>
