" JEANIE ? " UNCLE BILLY SAID . Honey , are you awake ? " <p> I had n't been until he spoke , but now I was . Not just awake , but wide awake . It was a skill I 'd learned , how to be sound asleep one second , alert the next . It 's something I can do today . <p> " Yeah , " I said . <p> Uncle Billy was in his mid-thirties then , but his hair had already turned gray . Except for that , he looked exactly like my father had looked . He had a pleasant enough face , nice blue eyes . At various times in their lives he and Daddy had been mistaken for one another . Once , after a high-school dance , they 'd switched places and fooled their dates . Daddy used to brag about that . <p> " We 're almost there , " Uncle Billy said . He glanced past me at Walter . <p> My brother 's head rested against the window glass . His eyes were shut tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always slept like that , like he was ready for a fight . But he was n't like me . It took a lot of doing to wake him up . <p> The wipers hurled sheets of water o the windshield . It had been raining hard when we left Jackson , and it was raining hard now . The road was slick . <p> It was a one-lane blacktop that ran between two cotton fields . It looked like any other road in the Delta , I guess , but it pleased me to think I recognized it . I had n't been here in more than four years . A lot had changed in that time , but the road had n't ; it was still the same strip of asphalt it had been way back then . <p> Aunt Margaret 's house stood right at the edge of a field . It was a farmhouse , a small one with white shingles on the sides and brown shingles on the roof , but Aunt Margaret did n't farm . She was the bookkeeper at Delta Implemene in Indianola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left her a year or two ago . As I understood it , nobody knew where he was . <p> " Maybe Lula 's run off to be with Larry , " Aunt Dot had said in the kitchen last night . " Maybe if you find her , you 'll find him too . " <p> Aunt Dot was Uncle Billy 's wife . Lula was my mother ; Larry was Aunt Margaret 's husband , the man who 'd run off . Aunt Margaret and Uncle Billy were my dead father 's brother and sister . <p> It gets confusing , I know . All these names , all these family relationships . I 'd like to say just forget all the ones who are dead or missing , I 'd like to tell you they 're not important to the story , but the truth is they may be the most important of all . <p> Them and Luke . He was standing there on the porch that morning with Aunt Margaret , both of them waiting , watching for us to show . He was already tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short lady . <p> We ran across the yard , jumping puddles , dodging a skinny dog that came tearing out from under the porch , barking like he meant to rip our hides . <p> " Shut up , " Luke yelled at the dog . " You damned old mongrel . Do n't nobody know where you come from . " He bent and grabbed a rock from a pile on the porch , then straightened up and drew his arm back . The dog aimed to bite me , I knew he did , but the look on Luke 's face made me feel for the animal . Luke hurled the rock sidearm . It thudded against the dog , who howled and ran back under the house . <p> " Did you see that ? " Walter said later , after we 'd gone inside and dried off . My brother loved animals , had loved them all his life . He was twelve years old and had never owned a dog or a cat or a pet of any kind , but all the animals on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . Two or three neighborhood dogs always followed him to school . " Anybody that 'd do that to a dog , " Walter said , shaking his head , " hell , there ai n't no telling about him . There flat ai n't no telling . " <p> We had come to Indianola to stay with Aunt Margaret because the previous day , a Monday , our momma had left us . It had been the first day of summer vacation . I 'd woken up around seven o'clock , just like I would have if school had been in session , and I 'd put on my bathrobe and walked down the hall to the kitchen . It would take a week or so , I figured , to get used to sleeping longer . <p> Momma had a job checking groceries at the Jitney-Jungle on West Capitol , and she was supposed to be at work by eight-thirty . I expected her to be in the kitchen , drinking coffee , possibly talking to some man I 'd never seen before , who would more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house at that time , the presence of strangers was always a possibility . But that morning nobody was there . <p> All the dishes had been washed and stacked in the dishrack The drying rag was still damp . A note lay on the table . It said , You can call your Uncle Billy . He 'll take care of you or see to it somebody does . I 'm sorry . I hope you 'll one day forgive me . Momma . <p> I ca n't say I 've never walked out on anybody , because I have . But everybody I 've ever walked out : on was grown , and I never did it while they were asleep . Every time I left , I looked the person I was leaving right straight in the eye . It did n't matter whether I was taking off due to something silly , like him neglecting to wash his dishes till finally I came to think of him as nothing more than a gravy-stained bowl , or whether I 'd caught him in the sack , like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going , I said . Here 's why . <p> But the morning Momma left , it was that sheet of paper that told me , and ever since then the sight of a piece of white paper lying on a table or a countertop has made me weak in the knees . <p> I walked back down the hall and into the room I shared with Walter . It was a tiny room , barely big enough to hold our bunk bed . There were ugly brown stains on the ceiling . We 'd dealt with a lot of bad news in that room , and the truth was I hated it . But at least I knew how to deal with bad news there . Dealing with bad news elsewhere was something I might have to work on . <p> I put my hand on Walter 's shoulder and shook him . He did n't budge . I shook him again . <p> " Wake up , " I said . <p> He finally opened his eyes . <p> " Momma 's gone , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess , that Walter never once thought I meant Momma had gone to work . He knew I meant gone in the big sense . But even in the big sense , there are different kinds of gone . <p> He sat up . " Dead " he said . " Or in the road " <p> " In the road , " I said , because that was all I could swear to . <p> I called Aunt Dot and gave her the news in a-matter-of-fact way , like it was no big deal . I must have understood that we were about to become objects of pity and that the disadvantages of being pitied far outweighed the advantages . " Momma 's left us , " I said . " The note said to call y'all . " <p> " Jesus , " she said . " The good Lord did n't want the world to be boring , so He cooked up the likes of Lula . " <p> She called Uncle Billy at the pesticide company where he worked , and he came for us in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to think we needed to go to bed , even though it was just midmorning and we 'd been asleep for eight or ten hours . They sent their kids  --  they had a house full of them  --  out to the park to play , and Dot stripped the sheets off two beds and put clean ones on and kept saying , " Y'all must be exhausted ; you just need to rest . " <p> It had been like that the day Daddy died . It was summertime then too , and Momma had left us at home alone , hooked up to the television set while she went out to buy groceries . Aunt Dot was the one who showed up to break the news . She 'd knocked on the door in the middle of the day , her eyes red-rimmed , and she 'd headed straight for our bedroom and started turning back the covers on our beds , saying something about Eagle Lake , about Daddy and Uncle Billy going fishing in a boat , and then something about Uncle Billy turning his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd said . She fluffed my lumpy old pillow . " Just for a minute , a second , he turned his back , and then he turned around . And children , your daddy was gone . " <p> Our daddy was not above playing practical jokes on other adults . Once , I knew , he 'd parked his pickup on another street and hidden in the hall closet and then jumped out and said Boo to Momma . He 'd told us all about it at the supper table . " Your momma , " he said , " looked like she 'd seen a ghost . " <p> " He 's probably just playing a trick , " I told Aunt Dot . " He 's probably just trying to fool Uncle Billy . " <p> " Oh , honey , " she said . " They 're dragging the lake . " <p> " What 's that mean ? " <p> " Baby , they 're trying to pull up his body . " <p> The distance between her last two words was what froze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body was another . <p> " Y'all get in bed , " she said . She nudged Walter toward the lower bunk . He crawled in , and she pulled the covers up to his neck and tucked him in . <p> I must have climbed into the upper bunk because the next thing I knew she was tucking me in too . I lay there above my brother , staring at the stains on the ceiling , knowing they 'd been left there by water . <p> Aunt Margaret acted calm , like it truly was no big deal that Momma had run off . Aunt Margaret had been deserted herself , and in the years since all this happened , I 've come to believe that you can divide people up on the basis of whether or not they 've ever been abandoned . You can take things a step further and divide those who have according to when and how they were left . Uncle Larry , so Luke would tell me later on that summer , had left in the middle of the night , just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he told Aunt Margaret that she 'd kept her ass in cold storage so long it had turned to dry ice . I imagine that after hearing that from the father of her son , she 'd grown a little bit numb . <p> Our first morning at her place she got up early to fix breakfast . I was sleeping on the living room couch by myself  --  she 'd put an army cot in Luke 's room for Walter to sleep on  --  and I lay there awake that morning , listening to her cook . While she moved around the kitchen , cracking eggshells and frying bacon , she hummed softly , one hymn blending with another . " Just as I Am " became " Standing on the Promises , " and that one ran right into " Love Lifted Me . " <p> At breakfast you could tell Luke and Walter had n't gotten along especially well during the night . " Can I have some butter " Walter said . <p> Luke was fourteen , a year older than me . He had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black hair , and eyes so dark that they suggested pure absence . Whoever Momma had left for , I figured , stood a fair chance of being an older version of Luke . <p> He picked up the butter dish and kind of jabbed it at Walter . " Here , Johnny U. " <p> Walter 's face darkened . " Never mind . " <p> " Suit yourself , " Luke said . He set the butter dish back down . <p> Aunt Margaret sipped her coffee . " What 's this all about " <p> " He 's trying to convince me the only decent football in the state 's played in the Big Eight , " Luke said . " He thinks the Delta Valley Conference is just a kindergarten league . " <p> " That ai n't what I said . " <p> " What did you say ? " <p> " What he said do n't matter , " Aunt Margaret said . " What matters is that Walter 's a guest here , Luke , and it 's up to you to make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was still at the stage where he had to pretend to show respect for his momma , though later on it became clear to me that he did n't respect her at all . He did n't respect her because the way he saw it , it had been up to her to keep his daddy at home , and somehow she 'd failed at the only task that mattered . <p> After breakfast she told us it 'd be our job to wash the dishes every morning and we 'd have to fix our own lunch . Walter and Luke would get together on taking care of the yard , and I was responsible for cleaning the house . She was sorry , she said , about what had happened , but things would work out somehow , and in the meantime it was going to be a huge help to her to have us around . <p> She left for town , and there we were . For a while the three of us sat on the porch , Luke and Walter not even looking at one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knew what he was thinking about . <p> He was thinking about that day four years ago when I 'd walked out into the woods behind the house with him . We 'd played in those woods on weekends when we came to visit . We 'd played Robin Hood in them , played cowboys and Indians , played GIs and Germans . But that day four years ago Luke said he did n't want to play . He said he wanted me to watch him do something . And I stood there , my back against the bark of a tree , while he did what he had to do . <p> I did n't bother to wonder why he wanted to do it in front of me . It seemed like a natural enough thing . I 'd already seen two boys do it , a pair of twins who lived on our street . A drainage ditch cut our block in two , and there was a big culvert that ran under the pavement . The twins had done it in there while I watched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and told Momma . I remember she was shelling purple-hulled peas at the time , watching TV . She was wearing tight shorts and a white bra . Her skin was shiny from sweat . We did n't have an air conditioner , and the house was stifling . She set her pan down and took my hand . " Boys just need to do that , " she said . " As long as they 're doing that and nothing else , I would n't worry . " <p> " But why do they want me to watch ? " <p> " Well , they 're at a stage right now , " she said , " where they kind of like an audience . " She let go of my hand and picked up her pan , and it seemed like she 'd said all she aimed to say . But as I turned away , she spoke again . " Actually , " she said , " the stage the twins are at is the least dangerous stage of all . " <p> As the three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew full well that Luke had progressed to a lot more dangerous stage . But for some reason I could n't have explained , I believed he was more dangerous to my brother than he could ever be to me . <p> " Well , " he finally said , " I do n't aim to just sit here all day . Can you hit a baseball , Johnny U , or do the NFL rules limit you to football " Walter was sitting in a lawn chair . His fingers closed around the metal armrests , squeezing them . I remember thinking that he had a lot to prove . Unless Uncle Billy found Momma or she came back pretty quick on her own , Walter was in for a long summer , three months of being dogged from within and without . All I 'd have to deal with , I thought , was the empty hole in the middle of my chest , that absence I did n't know a name for . It seemed , right then , that I 'd got the better deal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the yard . They used it as a backstop that morning . Luke started out as the pitcher , and while I sat there watching he hurled one pitch after another past Walter , who flailed at the ball so hard he lost his balance once or twice and went down in the mud . He tore the knees out of his jeans . A big brown stain spread across his seat , making it look like he 'd soiled himself . <p> Ball after ball thumped the tank ; Walter 's bat whisked the air . Every third time my brother missed , Luke raised his fist and hollered " K " and glanced my way . <p> Finally I decided to try an experiment . Without saying anything , I got up and went inside . I walked to the window , crouched , and lifted the edge of the curtain . Luke was staring at the porch , at the empty chair where I 'd been sitting . <p> " Hell , " he said . He tossed his glove toward the house , as if in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny U. You blind or what ? " <p> Walter let the bat dangle by his leg for a few seconds , then dropped it on the ground . He did n't drop it in any angry sort of way ; it was n't like the way Luke had thrown the glove . The bat had n't failed Walter , Walter had failed the bat . You could tell he was thinking that . <p> " No , I 'm not blind , " he said , his voice tinged with regret . <p> You know how when you 're having money trouble , you can put it out of your mind and put it out of your mind , just thinking that somehow , surely , something 's going to come along and solve your problems  --  that you 'll win a grocery store jackpot , or you 'll be walking along one day and there 'll be an envelope in the ditch with five thousand dollars inside You think like that and think like that until one day a collection agency calls and you ca n't hide from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times worse than you ever thought they could be . <p> That 's what it was like that summer for Walter and me In the backs of our minds we really thought we would n't be at Aunt Margaret 's too long . We thought our problem , our worst one anyway , would soon be solved . Uncle Billy had claimed he 'd find Momma , and we believed in Uncle Billy . We 'd always believed in Uncle Billy , in ways we 'd never believed in our own daddy . <p> Our daddy had been the kind of man who loved to give his kids things  --  he bought us candy on his way home from work and hollered Time for sweets when he walked in , and every week or two he bought us small toys , dumptrucks and water pistols for Walter , dolls and crayons for me  --  but he had n't liked to spend time playing with us , and it 's in play that kids start to trust adults . Nine times out of ten , when I got an image of Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd sold tires for a living at a Firestone service center down the street from Livingston Park Zoo , and when he came home every afternoon , he brought the Jackson Daily with him and spent an hour or two behind it . If I asked him to draw with me or read me a book , he 'd always say " Angel , hold your horses " and go right back to reading the paper , and if Walter asked him to go out and throw a ball , he 'd say " Maybe later , " but later it would be dark . <p> Uncle Billy had always had time for both of us , and Uncle Billy was often around . Even before Daddy drowned , we got used to coming home from school and finding his truck parked at the curb . He fixed things around our house , things Daddy would n't touch , like the stove and the washing machine and , once , even our TV . But when we got home , he 'd drop whatever he was doing and spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen fixing supper . I 'd let him throw me into the air , and so would Walter , and if he 'd told me to jump off the house , I probably would have , because if Uncle Billy said do it , it just could n't hurt . So when he said he 'd find Momma and told us not to worry , we did n't . <p> A couple of weeks passed . We did n't see him , and we did n't see her . And then , all at once , it hit us . Hard . <p> I was in the house , mopping the kitchen floor , when I heard the sound of shattering glass . I ran into the hallway . The bathroom door was open , and shards of glass lay all over the tiles in front of the toilet . In the middle of the floor was a golf ball . <p> I stepped over the glass and looked through the broken windowpane . Walter was standing in the backyard , the brim of a green baseball cap pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . <p> " What did you do ? " <p> " I 'm trying to learn how to hit . " <p> " A golf ball ? " <p> " If you can hit one of them , you sure as hell ought to be able to hit a baseball . " <p> " Why did you hit it toward the house ? " <p> He shrugged . " Hooked it . " <p> Luke had gone to town that morning with Aunt Margaret , to spend the day playing baseball with some kids from his school . She 'd made him invite Walter , but Walter had said no thanks . Luke had n't let up on Walter that much in the last two weeks , though there were days when he gave up deviling him long enough to spend some time watching me . He 'd follow me around the house while I did the cleaning . He never offered to help , but every now and then he 'd say , " Look over yonder in the corner , seem like you missed a spot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . He did n't care whether he was in front of me or behind me when I did it , just so long as he was standing somewhere nearby . <p> I started to tell Walter he 'd better be glad we were here by ourselves , since Luke would have embarrassed him to death had he been around to witness the accident . Then it occurred to me that it might not matter much whether or not Luke had seen it . The windowpane was broken , and there was n't a thing in the world we could do about that . When Aunt Margaret got home , we 'd have to tell her . <p> But we did n't have to tell her the complete truth . I 'd lived my whole life in a world full of lies , though I did n't know it at that moment . All I knew was that I aimed to tell one . <p> " Listen , " I said , " you get in here and help me clean this up . " <p> He came in , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he squatted , holding Aunt Margaret 's metal dustpan . I swept the glass into it , and then I said , " You know how this happened " <p> He tipped the brim of his cap back , so that I could see his eyes . " How ? " <p> " I was in here mopping the tiles , " I said , " and I slipped , and when I slipped I kind of threw the mop out behind me , and the handle hit the windowpane and smashed it . " <p> He squatted there before me , looking up at me , the painful of broken glass in his hand . " It 's just us , ai n't it ? " he said . " Uncle Billy 's not gon na find Momma . She 's not coming back . " <p> " I do n't think she is , " I said . <p> As it turned out , time would prove both of us wrong . Figured in the ordinary way , it would n't even be that long before it happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd see a truck coming toward us on the blacktop road . As it got closer , the truck would become a red truck , then a red truck with white door-panels and a CB antenna , and Walter would say , " It 's Uncle Billy . " <p> The truck would pull up beside Aunt Margaret 's mailbox , and Momma would get out . She 'd be wearing a pair of red pants that were too tight for her and a white T-shirt with a coffee stain on it . She 'd walk across the grass , toward me and Walter , and when she got close , we 'd see the glaze on her cheeks and the red streaks in her eyes , and before she managed a word Walter and I would be up and moving into her arms . <p> But I did n't count time in the ordinary way . When Daddy drowned , I 'd learned to measure time in my own personal way . The way I counted it , a year could wind up having no significance , but a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are instants when ages roll . That summer at Aunt : Margaret 's , Walter and I became old . <p> For the Fourth of July , Aunt Margaret planned a party . The party would be for just the four of us . She talked about it for at least ten days beforehand , making plans , going on about the homemade ice cream we 'd eat , about the way the fireworks she 'd bought across the river in Arkansas would light up the night sky . It was n't her favorite holiday , she said , Christmas was number one , but the Fourth was probably number two . <p> " You know what we used to do ? " she said . It was suppertime , the night before the Fourth . " We used to go over to Greenville and rent a motorboat at the marina and get out on Lake Fergusson and ski . Can you imagine that ? " she said . " Me ? " <p> What she meant was could we imagine somebody her size , with her build , skimming across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did it real good , " I said . <p> " No , she did n't , " Luke said . " She had trouble getting up . Daddy dragged her halfway across the lake one day with her head in the water . He like to ... " <p> His voice trailed off . Even Luke was sensitive enough to know that drag and lake were not words you wanted to use in our presence . <p> After supper , it being Wednesday night , Aunt Margaret got dressed up and went to prayer meeting . I 'd taken to going out and walking the road sometimes around dusk , and I took a notion to do it that night . I was preparing myself , I can see now , for an independent life , getting ready to be alone in the dark . <p> It was a cooler night than we 'd been having . Katydids sang their dry chorus ; a soft breeze rustled the leaves on the cotton . <p> The cotton was dark green and about three feet tall . Tall enough or somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . If somebody had wanted to do that , he would have bent real low and crept along between two rows fifteen or twenty yards from the road . And then , when it was almost dark and you were a mile from the house , way out in the middle of the country , where the next car or truck might not come along for another hour or two , he 'd hunker down in the field and make a sound he thought you 'd associate with ghosts and haunted houses  --  Wooooooooooo  --  and after that he 'd wait to see if he 'd scared you . <p> He could n't know that there were times when you longed to see a ghost , that while many things did frighten you an encounter with the dead was not among them . He did n't know that no sound could scare you , that an absence of sound was the thing you feared , or that it was this ear that made you walk alone at night , that you were steeping yourself in silence . <p> I crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came toward me , parting the thick stands of cotton with his forearms , stepping over the rows and then jumping the road ditch . <p> " Hey , " he said . <p> " Hey . " <p> " I should n't have said that about dragging Momma through the lake . I 'm sorry . As far as that goes , I should n't have tried to scare you just now . I 'm sorry about that too . I did it because I 'm a little scared myself . " <p> All my life , I 've had a problem when males apologize to me . It does n't happen often , but when it does my natural tendency is to want to forgive anything they 've done . I forgive and forgive until the forgiveness well runs dry , and then I get in the road . <p> The first time a guy apologized to me was the time I just told about . I was standing in the road when it happened , and it 's a shame I did n't keep on walking . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You know . " <p> " I do n't have any idea . " <p> He jammed his hands into his pockets . He glanced back down the road , toward the house . And in that instant , I have to say , he really did look scared . <p> The condition of the pavement suddenly seemed to enthrall him . <p> " You , " he said . <p> " Me ? " <p> " What you might say . Who you might say it to . " <p> " Say what ? About what ? " <p> " You know , " he said again . <p> I did know , but I did n't aim to say so . If it was going to be put into words , he 'd have to do the putting . " No , " I said , " I do n't know . " <p> " That time you watched me . " <p> I do n't remember moving my feet , and maybe I did n't . Yet I had the impression that we 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face is inches from mine . I can hear his breath , see the faint fuzz on his cheeks . His eyes are big and round . <p> " What about it ? " <p> " How would you feel , " he said , " if I 'd watched you do something like that ? " <p> " I do n't know , " I said . <p> He told me later it was almost like I was asking him to do what he did next . That 's always the way , is n't it ? Where there 's no question mark they hear one ; where there 's no invitation they read RSP . <p> He put both arms around me . When he pressed his mouth to mine , sound filled my ears , a puzzling sound , one I could n't account for until later , when I understood that a heart can roar just as well as beat and pound . <p> Luke 's daddy , Uncle Larry , had raised cattle at one time , only a few of them , Luke said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , " Luke said . " It did n't come to much . About the only thing he ever did well was run off . " <p> The wooden shed he 'd kept the feed in was still standing . It was almost a hundred yards behind the house , on the far side of the equipment shed and the barn . The first time I went in it , that same night Luke stopped me on the road , I noticed an odd smell in the air . <p> " What 's that odor ? " <p> " Cottonseed meal and cottonseed hulls . " <p> " I thought cows ate hay . " <p> " They do . But come wintertime you feed ' em extra stuff too . If you want ' em to give milk . " <p> The word milk hung in the air between us . Reaching for me in the darkness , pushing up my shirt to rub my breasts too hard , he made a sound that was not far from a sob . <p> " Jeanie , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough and uneven , and when I sank onto them they felt spongy , like the floor might give way . " Wait , " he said , and he spread an empty feed sack for me to lie back on . <p> That was the first time , with that burlap sack pressed against my back , making me itch , those floorboards creaking and groaning , and then another sort of groaning , this big sound coming from somewhere , from me , from someplace in me deeper than my throat , deeper than my diaphragm even . The sound filled the shed , it was so loud I was convinced they could hear it in town . <p> It was dark in there , but my eyes had adjusted , and I could see my own feet in the air . I did n't know how they 'd got up there . Feet did n't belong in the air . My toes splayed out , tense and rigid . <p> I 'm not saying I loved it , but I 'm not saying I did n't learn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what passed between us that summer . Several nights I went to the feed shed , and I did n't go alone . <p> You could kind of feel it coming from the early morning on . On days when he aimed to ask me to go to the shed with him , Luke would hang around the kitchen , he 'd help me wash dishes , he 'd dry them and stack them in the cabinet . If Walter tried to help , Luke would say , " Aw , hell , Walter , you 're company . Go on out there and play . Hit some fly balls , why do n't you , and in a minute or two I 'll come out and pitch you a few . " <p> At first , Walter 's face would go slack when Luke acted nice toward him , but in no time he began to buy it . <p> " He 's not so bad , " Walter said . " Me and him might could be buddies . " <p> Luke quit throwing balls past him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bat on the ball . <p> " You 're getting the knack of it , " Luke would say when Walter knocked one into the field across the road . " Hey , that 's the way . " <p> It was not as long as you might think before I understood that whatever else might come of it , one product of my going to the feed shed with Luke was a little bit of peace for my brother . And once I understood that , I could n't refuse to go , even if ' d wanted to . Which I did n't . <p> There are two kinds of knowing . <p> There 's the kind that comes sudden , where the big question is answered all at once and it 's a while before the little ones start to nag you . Your daddy 's dead , that 's the big thing . It 's three days till they find his body , it 's a year before you hear a neighbor ask your momma what she thinks made the gash in his forehead , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little while longer till you wonder about that , and it nags you a day or two and then you forget . <p> There 's the kind that comes slow , where the facts add up day by day , week by week . Your sister disappears from the house around the same time most nights . You see her head off down the road , you watch her till she 's almost out of sight . Your cousin puts on his shorts and says he 's going to jog , that he 's got to get in shape for fall and football , but he never invites you to come along , even though you know he can run you into the ground , and you ca n't figure out why he would n't get a kick out of doing it . Then you finally say it to yourself . In the end this kind of knowing is sort of sudden too , because there 's that single instant when you admit possessing knowledge . Or maybe it 's more truthful to say the knowledge possesses you . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of it , the same bathroom window Walter had knocked the ball through . It happened on a Monday morning toward the end of July , not long after Aunt Margaret left for work . We did n't know it then , but Momma would show up within a week , her and Uncle Billy would ride up one day , and in less than an hour we 'd all be on our way back to Jackson . We 'd take up where we 'd left off , more or less . We 'd move back into the same house , and Momma would go to work at another grocery store . In a few years I 'd graduate from high school , Walter would leave to join the marines , and a year after that he 'd die in a bunker at Khe Sanh . They lined those bunkers , so I 'm told , with sandbags made out of burlap . <p> I 'd been in there using the bathroom . I 'd just stood up and wiped myself when I looked out the window . Walter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . His glove lay on the ground . <p> Walter drew the bat back and swung it at Luke 's head , and Luke ducked and dove hard at Walter 's knees . Walter went over backward , and Luke began to beat him about the face . <p> I had my pants up then and was running , out of the bathroom and down the hall and out the front door . <p> When I came around the corner of the house , I saw that they 'd both regained their feet . Luke had Walter in a headlock , and he was dragging him toward the road ditch . <p> " You think she do n't want it ? " I heard Luke say . " You think <p> made her ? Man , you got the kind of momma men kill for . You think your sister 's a nun , or what ? " <p> It would be a few seconds before I started running again , before I threw myself at Luke , began to claw at his eyes and ears and draw as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there and watched . From where I stood , Walter and Luke looked about the same size . Their hair was the same color ; they had the same color eyes ; they were both wearing blue jeans and T-shirts . <p> From where I stood , they could have passed for brothers , maybe even twins , and I 'm sure they would have looked the same way if you 'd been driving by on the blacktop road that day . You might have wondered , as you sped by , headed toward town or wherever , why one of them was trying to push the other headfirst into the ditch , what lesson he believed the muddy , stinking water might teach him . <p>
