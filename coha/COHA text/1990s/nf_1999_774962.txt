Second Impressions // I think it was the sight of a man power-washing his underpants that really brought home the differences , cultural and otherwise , between the old world and the new . // It was a cold , still morning in early winter , and the pulsing thumpthump , thumpthump of a high-pressure hose echoed through the village . Getting closer to the sound , it was possible to see , over a garden wall , a laundry line totally devoted to gentlemen 's underwear in a stimulating assortment of colors . The garments were under attack , jerking and flapping under the force of the water jet like hanging targets in a shooting gallery . Standing some distance away , out of ricochet range , was the aggressor , in cap and muffler and ankle-high zippered carpet slippers . He had adopted the classic stance of a soldier in combat , feet spread apart , shooting from the hip , a merciless hail of droplets raking back and forth . The underpants did n't stand a chance . // Only a few days before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Provence after an absence of four years . Much of that time had been spent in America , where we were able to slip back into the comfortable familiarity of a language that was relatively free  --  although not entirely  --  from the problems of being socially appropriate or sexually accurate . No longer did we have to ponder the niceties of addressing people as vous or tu , or to rush to the dictionary to check on the gender of everything from a peach to an aspirin . English was spoken , even if our ears were rusty and some of the fashionable linguistic flourishes took a little getting used to . // A friend of below-average height told us he was not considered short any more but " vertically challenged " ; the hour , previously a plain old sixty minutes , had sprouted a " top " and a " bottom " ; you were not seen leaving a room , but " exiting " it ; the economy was regularly being " impacted , " as though it were a rogue wisdom tooth ; great minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hopefully , " an agreeable word that never harmed a soul , was persistently abused . Important people did n't change their opinions , but underwent a significant " tactical recalibration. " // There were many and hideous outbreaks of legalese in everyday speech , reflecting the rise of litigation as a national spectator sport . " Surplusage " was one of a hundred of these horrors . I noticed also that sophisticated and influential Americans  --  those whose comments are sought by the media  --  were not content to finish anything but preferred to " reach closure , " and I have a nasty feeling that it wo n't be long before this affectation is picked up by waiters in pretentious restaurants . I can hear it already : " Have you reached closure on your salad ? " ( This , of course , would only be after you had spent some time bending your " learning curve " around the menu. ) // We met , for the first time , the " outster , " although we never saw a trace of his more fortunate relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hopelessly old-fashioned habit of concentrating and instead try " focusing . " Every day seemed to bring new and exciting vocabulary options . But these minor curiosities did n't alter the fact that we were surrounded by at least some version of the mother tongue and therefore should have felt quite at home . // Somehow we did n't , although it certainly was n't for lack of a welcome . Almost everyone we met lived up to the American reputation for friendliness and generosity . We had settled in a house outside East Hampton , on the far end of Long Island , a part of the world that , for nine months a year , is quiet and extremely beautiful . We wallowed in the convenience of America , in the efficiency and the extraordinary variety of choice , and we practiced native customs . We came to know California wines . We shopped by phone . We drove sedately . We took vitamins and occasionally remembered to worry about cholesterol . We tried to watch television . I gave up taking cigars to restaurants , but smoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we drank eight glasses of water a day . In other words , we did our best to adapt . // And yet there was something missing . Or rather , an entire spectrum of sights and sounds and smells and sensations that we had taken for granted in Provence , from the smell of thyme in the fields to the swirl and jostle of Sunday-morning markets . Very few weeks went by without a twinge of what I can best describe as homesickness. // Returning to a place where you have been happy is generally regarded as a mistake . Memory is a notoriously biased and sentimental editor , selecting what it wants to keep and invariably making a few cosmetic changes to past events . With rose-colored hindsight , the good times become magical ; the bad times fade and eventually disappear , leaving only a seductive blur of sunlit days and the laughter of friends . Was it really like that ? Would it be like that again ? // There was , of course , only one way to find out . // For everyone coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve-wracking shock to the system is traffic shock , and it hit us as soon as we left the airport . Instantly , we were sucked into high-velocity chaos , menaced on all sides by a hurtle of small cars driven , it seemed , by bank robbers making a getaway . The Frenchman on wheels , as we were quickly reminded , sees every car in front of him as a challenge , to be overtaken on either side , on blind bends , while lights are changing or when road signs are advising prudence . The highway speed limit of eighty miles an hour is considered to be an insufferable restriction of personal liberty , or perhaps some quaint regulation for tourists , and is widely ignored . // It would n't be so alarming if the equipment , both human and mechanical , were up to the demands placed on it . But you ca n't help feeling , as yet another baby Renault screams past with its tires barely touching the road , that small cars were never designed to break the sound barrier . Nor are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what 's going on behind the wheel . It is well known that the Frenchman can not put two sentences together without his hands joining in . Fingers must wag in emphasis . Arms must be thrown up in dismay . The orchestra of speech must be conducted . This performance may be entertaining when you watch a couple of men arguing in a bar , but it 's heart-stopping when you see it in action at ninety miles an hour . // And so it 's always a relief to get onto the back roads where you can travel at the speed of a tractor , with time to take in some of the graphic additions to the scenery . Ever since my first visit to Provence I have loved the faded advertisements painted on the sides of barns and solitary stone cabanons  --  invitations to try aperitifs that have long since vanished , or chocolate , or fertilizer  --  the paint chipped and peeling , the blues and the ochres and the creams bleached by the sun of seventy or eighty summers . // For years , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these seem to be increasing . Towns and villages now often have two names , one with the old Proven ? al spelling . So M ? nerbes now doubles as Menerbo , Avignon as Avignoun , Aix as Aixen-Prouven ? o . And this may only be the start . If the Proven ? al road-sign lobby continues to be active , we might one day see Frequent Radar Controls or Low-Flying Aircraft or even The Home of the Big Mac adapted to the language of Fr ? d ? ric Mistral 's poetry . // Signs are everywhere  --  informative , persuasive , educational , proprietorial , nailed on trees , perched on poles by the side of a field , attached to railings , pasted onto concrete ; signs for wine caves , for honey , for lavender essence and olive oil , for restaurants and real estate agents . Most are inviting . But there are a few which warn of savage dogs , and one  --  my favorite  --  is particularly discouraging . I saw it in the hills of Haute Provence , tied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path leading into a stretch of seemingly uninhabited wilderness . It read as follows : Tout contrevenant sera abattu , les survivants poursuivis . Which , roughly translated , means : Trespassers will be shot . Survivors will be prosecuted . I like to believe that the author had a sense of humor . // There is one other warning I ca n't imagine seeing anywhere else in the world but France . You can find it in the Place des Lices , in St.-Tropez , where the market is held every week , an enamel sign screwed to the railings . It informs the passer-by in large type and stern language that he is absolutely forbidden to stop and relieve himself in the vicinity  --  a message one can not imagine being necessary in East Hampton , for instance , a town noted for its well-toned and highly disciplined bladders . // The message is necessary in France because of the Frenchman 's fondness for impromptu urination . Whenever nature calls , he is quick to answer , and it does n't matter where he finds himself at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners ; out here in the country , hundreds of empty square miles and millions of bushes ensure privacy for le pipi rustique . But judging by what I 've seen of the Frenchman 's choice of venue , privacy is the last thing that he wants . Sometimes on a rock , silhouetted against the sky like a stag at bay , sometimes so close to the side of the road that you have to swerve to avoid cutting him off in midstream , he is there , doing what a man has to do . And he has not the slightest embarrassment about doing it . If you should catch his eye as you pass , he will acknowledge you with a courteous nod . But it is more likely that he will be gazing upward , counting the clouds as he takes his ease . // Luckily , such forbidding notices are not at all typical of the greeting one can expect in most public places . The politeness of strangers in France is noticeable  --  not necessarily friendly but invariably well-mannered , and a morning of running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledgments that you exist , something that does n't always happen in other countries . In England , for example , many shopkeepers make a point of behaving as if you 're not there , possibly because you have n't been formally introduced . In America , the land of rampant informality , you can frequently find the other extreme , and the customer has to respond to well-meaning inquiries about his overall health and how he 's doing followed , if they 're not quickly nipped in the bud , by a stream of comments and questions about ancestry , clothing , oddities of pronunciation , and general appearance . The French , it seems to me , strike a happy balance between intimacy and reserve . // Some of this must be helped by the language , which lends itself to graceful expression even when dealing with fairly basic subjects . No , Monsieur , you have n't made a beast of yourself at the table ; you 're simply suffering from a crise de foie . And could that be flatulence we hear coming from the gentleman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of the piano des pauvres , the poor man 's piano . As for that stomach we see threatening to burst the buttons on your shirt , well , that 's nothing but a bonne brioche . And there is that famously elegant subtitle from a classic Western . // COWBOY : " Gim me a shot of red-eye. " // SUBTITLE : " Un Dubonnet , s'il vous pla ? t. " // No wonder French was the language of diplomacy for all those years . // It is still the language of gastronomy , and in a country that often gives the impression  --  at least on the roads  --  of being late for lunch or dinner , you would expect to see more physical evidence of the national passion for good food . More solid flesh , more Michelin men rolling from one meal to the next . But it is n't so ; not , at least , in Provence . Of course they exist , these mammoths of the table , but they are few . The vast majority of men and women I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any right to be . I 've heard people from other countries explain this as the result of some benign cocktail of the genes , or an overactive metabolism brought on by too much coffee and French politics , but the true answer must lie in what they eat and drink and how they eat and drink it . // The French do n't snack . They will tear off the end of a fresh baguette ( which , if it 's warm , is practically impossible to resist ) and eat it as they leave the boulangerie . And that 's usually all you will see being consumed on the street . Compare that with the public eating and drinking that goes on in America : pizza , hot dogs , nachos , tacos , heroes , potato chips , sandwiches , huge containers of coffee , half-gallon buckets of Coke ( Diet , of course ) , and heaven knows what else being demolished on the hoof , often on the way to the aerobics class . // Restraint between meals is rewarded as soon as a Frenchman sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalities become deeply puzzled . How is it possible for a body to pack in two serious meals a day without turning into a human balloon or keeling over with arteries that are rigid with cholesterol ? French portions are fairly modest , certainly , but they never stop coming , and they will often include dishes that would horrify doctors in the States : creamy rillettes of pork , p ? t ? s laced with Armagnac , mushrooms wrapped in buttery pastry , potatoes cooked in duck fat  --  and these are merely to set you up for the main course . Which , naturally , has to be followed by cheese ; but not too much , because dessert is still to come . // And who could contemplate a meal without a glass or two of wine for the stomach 's sake ? Some years ago , seekers after the gastronomic truth discovered what the French have known for centuries , and pronounced that a little red wine was good for you . Some of them went further . Looking for a tidy explanation of what came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French drink ten times more wine than Americans . Voil ? ! Paradox explained . It must be wine that keeps the French trim and healthy . // I 'd like to think it were as simple as that , but I have a feeling that there are other , less dramatic influences at work on and in the French stomach . I believe , without a shred of scientific proof , that the raw ingredients here contain fewer additives , preservatives , colorants , and chemical novelties than in the States . I also believe that food eaten at a table is better for you than food eaten hunched over a desk , standing at a counter , or driving in a car . And I believe that , wherever you do it , hurried eating has ruined more digestive systems than foie gras . Not long ago , there was a fad in certain New York restaurants for the guaranteed thirty-minute lunch , enabling the busy and important executive to entertain two different victims in the space of an hour . If that is n't a recipe for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // It 's true that time in Provence is not worshipped in quite the same way as it is in more hectic parts of the world , and it took me a week or two to bow to the inevitable and put my watch away in a drawer . But while there is no great importance given to time in the sense of punctuality , there is an enormous relish of the moment . Eating , obviously . Conversation on a street corner . A game of boules . The choosing of a bunch of flowers . Sitting in a caf ? Small pleasures receive their due , and there is an absence of rush  --  sometimes infuriating , often delightful , and in the end contagious . I realized this when I went into town on an errand that need only have taken fifteen minutes , and came back two and a half hours later . I had done absolutely nothing of any importance , and I had enjoyed every minute of it . // Perhaps the slower pace of life is partly responsible for another aspect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not famous for being jolly ; rather the reverse . Many foreigners tend to judge the mood of the entire nation on the basis of their first humiliating exposure to the Parisian waiter , not knowing that he is as morose and distant toward his countrymen  --  and probably toward his wife and cat as well  --  as he is to the tourist . But go south , and the difference is striking . There is an atmosphere of good humor , despite considerable social difficulties , high unemployment , and the financial guillotine of French income tax . // One response to these problems has been to leave them behind , and the newspapers of the moment are filled with stories about young French business people moving from Paris to take advantage of le boom in England . But if that kind of ambition exists in Provence , it is n't very apparent . Everyone agrees that times could be better ; everyone hopes they will be . Meanwhile , they fall back on the philosophy of the shrug . // It 's not a bad philosophy for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never short of curiosities , and the national genius for complication is never too far away . There may be some mad logic at work somewhere , but there are many times when it is difficult to understand . Take , for example , the matter of the village garbage dump . It is discreetly placed , frequently cleared , designed to accept debris of any type and size short of a discarded truck , an admirable facility in every way . An official notice is prominently displayed above the garbage containers ; translated it reads : Large items should be deposited two days after the last Wednesday of each month . // I stood and looked at it one morning for some time , thinking at first that I had misread it , or that my French was letting me down yet again . But no . That 's what it said . Two days after the last Wednesday of each month . Why did n't it say the last Friday of each month ? Was there some plan afoot  --  doubtless another piece of nonsense from the bureaucrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something more dynamic and politically exciting ? Euroday , perhaps . While I was wondering if this was a treat in store for the year 2000 , a small van arrived . The driver got out and studied the notice . He looked at me . I looked at him . He looked again at the notice , shook his head and shrugged . // Not long afterward , the notice was removed . I was told that everyone had continued to toss away their old refrigerators , bicycles , and TV sets whenever they felt like it , instructions or no instructions . The French love of signs is only equaled by their delight in ignoring them . // Put this together with another national characteristic , that of keeping your money as much as possible out of the clutches of authority , and you begin to understand the parking problem . Every town in Provence now has areas set aside where you can park your car off the street . These areas , clearly indicated by many signs and thus easy to find , are more often than not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are clogged with examples of imaginative and illegal parking . Cars with two wheels cocked on the sidewalk or stuffed into alleys with a bare six inches to spare on each side are commonplace . Miracles of stunt driving are performed as traffic backs up , tempers become frayed , horns squawk , and disputes erupt . And why ? Because the official parking area has the audacity and the naked greed to charge five francs an hour . // But  --  so I am assured by my friend Martine , who regularly parks where no others dare to park  --  it 's not just the money . It 's the principle . Le parking payant is an affront to the French ethos and must be resisted , even if that involves circling the town for half an hour in search of a place . Time , after all , is free . Moral and financial considerations aside , there is also the immense satisfaction to be gained by finding a truly exceptional spot . I once saw a man reverse his small Peugeot into the premises of a boutique that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking away , he looked back at the snug fit of his car in what would one day be a shop window and nodded at it , a moment of bonding between man and machine . It was as if together they had achieved a significant victory . // For me , moments that make up the texture of daily life define the character of Provence as much as the history or the landscape . And if I had to choose a single example of what I missed most in America , it would be a country market ; nothing out of the ordinary , just the usual collection of stalls that are set up each week in every town from Apt to Vaison-la-Romaine. // They have an instant visual charm , these markets , with their bursts of vividly colored flowers and vegetables and their handwritten signs , the stalls shaded by ancient plane trees or tucked up against even older stone walls . They might have been artistically arranged for a postcard photographer , or for the high season , to be dismantled and forgotten at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in August , because their bread and butter come from local inhabitants . The tourist is just a dollop of jam . Welcome , but not essential . // Stall-holders and customers know each other , and so shopping tends to be slow and social . Old Jean-Claude 's brand new smile is much admired while he selects some cheese , and there is some debate as to the precisely appropriate texture , given his recently fitted dentures . A Brie would be too sticky . A Mimolette , too hard . Perhaps some Beaufort would be best , until the new teeth have had a chance to settle in . Madame Dalmasso is plunged into a state of profound suspicion by the tomatoes . It is too early in the year for these to be local tomatoes . Where have they come from ? Why has n't their place of birth been written on the sign ? After some investigation  --  a squeeze , a sniff , the lips pursed  --  she decides to throw caution to the wind and to try half a kilo . A bearded man wanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one hand and an infant 's feeding bottle in the other . The bottle is for a baby sanglier that he has adopted , a tiny wild boar , its black snout twitching at the scent of milk . The flower lady gives my wife her change , then ducks under her stall to reappear with two freshly laid eggs which she gift wraps in a twist of newspaper . On the other side of the square , the tables outside the caf ? are filling up . Above the hiss and clatter of the espresso machine , a voice from Radio Monte Carlo , in raptures of enthusiasm , describes this week 's competition . Where do they find these people who never have to stop for breath ? Four old men sit in a row on a low stone wall , waiting for the market to end and the square to be cleared so that they can play boules . A dog sits up on the wall next to them . All he needs is a flat cap and he 'd look just like the men , patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , there is an almost tangible feeling of anticipation . Lunch is in the air , and today it is warm enough to eat outside . // There are two undeserved results of our time on the other side of the Atlantic . The first is that we are thought of as experts in all things American , and are regularly consulted about events taking place in Washington and Hollywood ( now almost the same place ) , as if we knew the politicians and film stars personally . The second is that we are in some way considered responsible for the spread of American tribal customs , and so we often find ourselves pinned to the wall by the accusing finger of Monsieur Farigoule. // A self-appointed guardian of French culture and the purity of the French language , Farigoule can work himself into a lather over everything from le fast-food to les casquettes de baseball , which have begun to appear on previously bare French heads . But on this particular autumn day , he had something infinitely more grave on his mind , and when he leaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very concerned . // " C'est un scandale , " was his opening remark , followed by a stream of disparaging comments about the pernicious influence of transatlantic imports on the fabric of French rural life . Farigoule is a very small man , almost a miniature , and when agitated tends to bounce up and down on his toes for emphasis , a little ball of outrage . If he were a dog , he 'd be a terrier . I asked what had upset him , and found my head going up and down in time with his bouncing . // " Alowine , " he said . " Is this what we need ? The country that gave birth to Voltaire and Racine and Moli ? re , the country that gave Louisiana to the Americans . And what do they give us in return ? Alowine. " // I had no idea what he was talking about , but from his tone of voice and his tightly clamped , downturned mouth it was a major catastrophe , a disaster to rank with a reappearance of phylloxera among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // " I do n't think I 've seen it , " I said . // " How could you not ? They are everywhere  --  les potirons mutil ? s  --  in Apt , in Cavaillon , everywhere . " // Mutilated pumpkins could only mean one thing . Like Mickey Mouse and tomato ketchup , Halloween had arrived in France , another nail in the cultural coffin . // After making my excuses , I went into Apt to see for myself . Farigoule had exaggerated , as he usually does , but it was true that Halloween decorations were displayed in one or two shop windows , the first time I had seen them in Provence . I wondered if the population had been officially informed of this addition to the festive calendar , and if they knew what they were supposed to do about it . A random sample interviewed in the streets of Apt revealed only puzzlement . Pumpkins meant soup . // Whose idea had it been to bring Halloween to Provence ? And would a health warning be issued to any bands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on trick-or-treat expeditions ? The dogs would get them for sure . Fortunately , the occasion passed without any reports of bloodshed in the local papers . Alowine , this year at least , seemed to be one of those parties where nobody showed up . // France , in any case , already has more than enough traditions of its own , which we were rediscovering month by month . There is May , which starts with a public holiday and continues with several more to prepare us for August , when the entire country is en vacances . There is a permanent festival of bureaucracy , marked by a snowstorm of paper . Each saint has a saint 's day , each village its annual f ? te . And each week , by popular demand , there is the feast of the common man , otherwise known as Sunday lunch . // Sunday is a day apart , a day that feels different even if one has n't spent the week in an office . The sounds change . Birdsong and the drone of tractors during the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunfire on Sunday mornings , when the Proven ? al hunter likes to exercise his right to defend the countryside from invasion by hostile rabbits and thrushes. // This year , he faces a more serious challenge than ever , from mutant sangliers . Nobody seems to know quite how it happened , but the wild boar population has multiplied with dramatic speed . One current theory is that sangliers  --  which normally produce a single small litter each year  --  have been mating with their more prolific cousin , the domestic pig , and their offspring are threatening to overrun the vineyards and orchards . You can see their calling cards everywhere : ruts gouged out of the earth in the search for food , vegetable gardens trampled , stone walls knocked awry . // The area around our house was sealed off one Sunday as part of an organized sanglier drive . At intervals down the long dirt road , hunters had parked their vans , snout first , in the bushes . Figures in camouflage green  --  armed , immobile , and sinister  --  waited while their dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoarse with excitement . I felt as though I had walked into a manhunt , or a war . // The first casualty appeared as I was nearing the house . A hunter was coming toward me with the sun directly behind him , and all I could make out in the distance was his silhouette . A rifle barrel slanted above one shoulder , and in his arms he was cradling something large , something with legs that flopped loosely on either side of the man 's body as he walked . // He stopped when he reached me . The black and tan hound he was holding rolled a lugubrious eye at our dogs , and the hunter , no less mournful , wished me good morning . I asked after the hound 's health . Had he been attacked and savaged in the bushes by an oversized piglet , a cornered sanglier protecting his patch ? // " Ah , le pauvre , " the hunter said . " He has passed all summer in the kennel , and that makes the paws soft . He 's run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // By eleven-thirty , the road was empty again . The army had withdrawn , to regroup and change uniforms and weapons . Combat fatigues and guns were replaced by clean shirts and knives and forks in preparation for an assault on the table . // Sunday lunch , at any time of year , is my favorite meal . The morning is undisturbed by work , the afternoon siesta free of guilt . I feel that restaurants have a more than usually good-humored air about them , almost an undercurrent of festivity . And I 'm sure that chefs try harder , knowing their clients have come to enjoy the cooking rather than to discuss business . There 's no doubt about it . Food tastes better on Sunday . // There are a dozen good restaurants within a twenty-minute drive of the house ; spoiled for choice , we can pick a place that suits the weather . The Mas Tourteron , with its vast shady courtyard and a selection of straw hats to keep customers ' heads cool , is as close as one gets to eating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is the Auberge de l'Aiguebrun  --  an open fire , a high , light , white-curtained room , and the view of a private valley . // What sets these apart from most other local restaurants , and indeed from most other restaurants in France , is that in both cases the chefs are women . The traditional division of labor has always placed the man in front of the oven and Madame behind the till . Now times are beginning to change , although no female chef has yet come close in terms of national recognition to Alain Ducasse , who has enough Michelin stars to decorate a tree . Women in France are better represented in medicine , in politics , and in the law than they are in restaurant kitchens . I find this odd , and I wondered if chauvinism has had something to do with it . // There is only one man to consult over a tricky social question like this if you want a provocative answer : R ? gis , who excels  --  in fact , I believe he 's been asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who is happy to share his opinions with the world . It did n't surprise me that he held strong views on the matter of female chefs , and when I asked him why there were n't more of them , the answer came out like a bullet . " What you have to understand , " he said , " is that in France some things are considered too important to be left to women . " // Female doctors , lawyers , and cabinet ministers R ? gis found curious but acceptable . Female chefs ( and female sommeliers ) made him suspicious and uneasy . It was somehow against the proper order of things . Professional cooking was man 's work . // He ate his words one winter Sunday , during lunch at the Auberge de l'Aiguebrun . After a cautious start with a gratin of Swiss chard , he continued without any apparent difficulty to deal with a lamb stew , a small mountain of various cheeses , and a dark , dense slab of triple-strength chocolate in a puddle of cr ? me anglaise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the restaurant , and I waited for him to admit that he might have been wrong . Not a chance . He merely adjusted his chauvinism to suit the moment . // " Only in France , " he said , " can you find cooking like that in the middle of nowhere . " He waved an arm at the mountains and at the sun pouring into the funnel of the valley . " It 's good to be back , is n't it ? " // Yes , it 's good to be back .
