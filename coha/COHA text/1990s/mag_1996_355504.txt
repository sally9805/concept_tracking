Yea , verily , English-speaking Christians in search of Scripture suffered , not long ago , few perturbations . Protestants reached for the Authorized , or King James , version of 1611 . Roman Catholics consulted the Douay-Rheims translation , first issued in 1609 but revised during the 18th century to resemble or duplicate in most particulars the memorable cadences and phrasing of the King James . For some two centuries , readers of either of these Bibles could feel that the word they sought was the Word , that they had access to the linguistic unity enjoyed by humankind before the Tower of Babel , " And the whole earth was of one language , and of one speech . " <P> No longer . The first modest assault on the long dominance of the King James version came in 1952 , when the National Council of Churches of Christ in the U.S. released the Revised Standard Version . Thanks to 350 years of discoveries in archaeology and philology , the Revised Standard more accurately , if rather less poetically , reflected the original documents than did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for most mainline Protestants . And after that trickle , the floodgates were opened . <P> There are now in print , according to Publisher 's Weekly , some 450 English translations , paraphrases or retellings of all or parts of the Old and New Testaments . There is a New King James Version and a New Revised Standard Version , plus the New International Version , the New American Standard , the New American Bible , the New Jerusalem Bible , Today 's English Version  --  also known as the Good News Bible  --  the Contemporary English Version and , well , the cup runneth over . These widely , wildly diverse texts chase the estimated $400 million that Americans spend each year on Bibles . And this proliferation of Bibles has in turn begotten a growing cottage industry in printed guides and videotapes intended to help both booksellers and customers sort through the many different choices . The age of so-called niche Bibles has arrived . <P> A major new competitor for all that cash appeared in bookstores this summer : the New Living Translation ( Tyndale House ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial print order of 950,000 , a $2.5 million promotional budget and a fail-safe , back-cover blurb from Billy Graham . The book is handsomely bound and printed and contains , at the end , a useful series of maps of biblical places . And anyone who remembers the King James will find some pretty startling things inside . <P> The New Living Translation is actually a revision and updating of The Living Bible ( 1972 ) , Kenneth Taylor 's loose , breezy paraphrase of the Old and New Testaments ( I Samuel 20 : 30 : " You son of a bitch " ) . It was frankly intended for readers who found Scriptural translations tough sledding , and those readers responded gratefully . The Living Bible has sold 40 million copies to date .
