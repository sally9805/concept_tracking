When my daughter Zoe was 18 months old , she searched the apartment after every visit from her father . Even though we broke up when she was tiny , she could n't understand why her daddy did n't live in her home like Mom . When I asked the staff at her daycare for help , they loaned us a stack of books on divorce , including Kathy Stinson 's Mom and Dad Do n't Live Together Anymore . Zoe wanted to hear the story over and over again , perhaps because it 's a good book , but mostly , I think , because it addressed her own confusion in a child 's own words . She could see pictures of another little girl with her dad at his house in the country , living with Mom downtown in her apartment , sharing special times with one or the other , and wishing they were all together . Whether your child is dealing with a deeply disturbing experience such as divorce or death , or more mundane challenges like temper tantrums and toilet training , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing with a story is changing the way she sees the world , " says Joseph Gold . " It 's that significant . " Gold 's work as a professor of English at the University of Waterloo ( Ontario ) led him into the field of psychotherapy . His 1990 book Read for Your Life sums up more than a decade of research on how books can help people cope in life . Gold says that books do n't solve problems , but they help readers of all ages think about them in new ways and develop valuable problem - solving skills . He believes stories are especially effective for children , who tend to think more in metaphor than in strictly literal terms . A well - chosen book reassures the reader that he is not alone , that other people have faced the same challenge , and that it 's perfectly normal . Toddlers take heart when they read about Prudence in Once Upon a Potty , who , after a few messy mistakes , learns to use her potty " every time . " Children who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be encouraged by Leo the Late Bloomer  --  about a young lion who is slow to read , write and draw . And almost anyone who reads Will I Have a Friend ? will sympathize with young Jim 's anxiety about starting school . One of the most popular " problem " books is Franklin in the Dark by Paulette Bourgeois , about a turtle who is afraid of small , dark places  --  including his own shell . In fact , the book was n't written to help kids who are afraid of the dark ; Bourgeois got the idea of a claustrophobic turtle from an old episode of M*A*S*H . Since then , she 's written four other books about Franklin and his challenges in life . But , the author points out , she never tries to preach . I never set out with a moral in mind or even a didactic message , " says Bourgeois . " If I do aim at something , it 's to have Franklin find his own solutions to problems . " Judy Sarick , owner of The Children 's Bookstore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lesson are often boring . " If a book deals with an issue , it 's got to have a story that carries it . " Sarick says some stories written to help children deal with difficult issues such as AIDS or divorce are simply " sugar - coating the pill , " and non - fiction may be a better choice . ( Over the past 19 years , Sarick has been compiling an index of books on topics ranging from adoption to zoos . The list accompanying this article includes many titles from her index . ) Susan Leventhal , a marriage and family therapist in Toronto , says parents should consider not only the child 's age , but also his level of maturity , knowledge of the subject and style of learning . ( For example , some kids will get more information from the pictures , while others may be more interested in the story itself . ) Make sure your child is involved in choosing the book , too , even if the one he wants is n't what you had in mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landsberg recounts dismissing P.D . Eastman 's Are You My Mother ? as " cartoonish " and " trite , " then discovering the book 's powerful appeal to her three small children . For preschoolers dealing with separation , the story of a baby bird searching for his mother is riveting drama . Both Leventhal and Gold caution against books that are intended for older audiences . " Younger kids are more impressionable , " says Leventhal , " so it 's really important to choose the proper kind of book  --  not too much information , not too little . " Gold says reading with your children is one antidote to the risk of scaring them with material that is over their heads . " I think if you 're there talking about what 's going on , and they can say how they feel , they do n't get scared . If they get a chance to exchange information , then the mystery that creates the fear goes away . " And , when you read a book together you can stop to discuss or explain things as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about their own concerns or feelings . While books are often used to help prepare children for new challenges , they can also help kids deal with bad experiences after the fact . For example , Helen Kohl 's daughter Laurel was hospitalized with her worst - ever asthma attack on New Year 's Eve . " It was really traumatic , " recalls the Toronto mom . " She had all these masks on , and they were huge on her little face . " Plus , Laurel required an IV , which was strapped to her arm with a board to prevent her from pulling it out . Afterwards , a friend gave Kohl a book about a stay in the hospital . " I must have read that book to her a hundred times , if only for the page of the kid with the IV , " she says . " Every time we got to that picture , she would talk about it . I think it really helped my daughter deal with that situation . " Reading books on " problem " topics may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ways than one . When you head for the library or bookstore to help your toddler cope with the monsters under her bed , for instance , you 're teaching her that this is a world in which she can take action to help herself feel better . " I think that 's a very powerful message to learn at two , " says Gold . And bringing home a book that speaks to your child 's fears or anxieties may have a positive impact independent of the story itself . " It may be that the act of doing that , and sharing the book , is just as powerful as the book itself , " says Gold . " Instead of writing off that problem , you 're saying You 're not alone ' and " I 'm interested in your problem . ' ' " A book can help kids understand other children 's challenges as well . Our Brother Has Down 's Syndrome , for instance , is an excellent book for anyone with a sibling , friend or classmate who has this condition . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may appeal to an only child , who can use the stories to experience the situation vicariously . Parents should be sensitive to what their kids are going through at different stages , " says Susan Leventhal , " and then they should select books to connect with those things . " Leventhal read The New Baby to her son to help prepare him for the arrival of his new sister . Three years later , she found herself reading the same story again and again to her young daughter  --  even though Leventhal was not planning to have any more children . " She wanted another one . She said " It 's time , Mommy . " " Reading the book helped her daughter express her wish for a little sister  --  and also helped her parents explain that there would be no new baby . Besides , it was , simply , a good story . Resources The following list comprises some popular books on a variety of common challenges kids face . Obviously , this list is selective , not exhaustive . For more suggestions , see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your librarian or children 's bookseller .
