The now famous Town Meeting that CNN broadcast from Columbus , Ohio , last Wednesday , when an unhappy trio of Administration foreign-policy advisers squirmed while cranks and crackpots fumed and bellowed , was by any measure a disaster  --  catastrophic as diplomacy , unlucky as public relations and worthless as a means of preparing the country for war . That 's too bad , of course , but look on the bright side : the Ohio calamity may do away with " national town meetings " once and for all . <P> Real town meetings  --  I mean the old-fashioned kind in which a town 's voting population meets annually to bicker , gossip , elect councilmen , vote on bond issues  --  are anachronisms today , surviving only in a few eccentric backwaters of Ye Olde New England . But the pseudo town meeting , as developed by the President and his imagemakers , is a ubiquitous political gimmick , practiced by candidates nationwide . Perfected in the President 's 1992 campaign , the format is familiar to anyone unlucky enough to own a TV . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV studio  --  is filled with a carefully screened audience . A local television anchor , his hair perfectly in place , serves as master of ceremonies . The candidate , or President as the case may be , wanders the stage looking thoughtful , pensively wagging his wireless microphone . The people speak , the candidate listens . And then he responds with perfectly scripted spontaneity . Concerns are addressed , issues are aired , dialogue is facilitated . And the public is snowed . <P> The format is now so firmly established that it has been included in the last two rounds of presidential debates . In both ' 92 and ' 96 , the Clinton camp insisted on it , and no wonder . The most painful moment in either campaign came in watching George Bush and Bob Dole struggle feebly to adapt themselves to this alien venue . Bill Clinton glided through the town meetings , reveling in the chance to display his almost superhuman empathy . But Bush and Dole were older gents , from a generation that considered reticence a virtue and self-exposure a weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had the stunned look of cavemen thawed out from the frozen tundra and suddenly dropped into a Las Vegas casino . Bush , you 'll recall , even glanced at his watch , wondering when the nightmare would end . <P> The traditional town meeting has its roots in the agora of ancient Athens , a place for sober , if contentious , deliberation . The Clintonized town meeting has a rather less noble lineage . It is the offspring of Phil Donahue , who , true to his format , once wore a dress to enliven the proceedings . The President has n't gone that far  --  not quite . But who can forget his town meeting on MTV in 1993 ? " Boxers or briefs ? " asked a budding Walter Lippmann in the studio audience . The President could have turned the question aside . " Madam , " he might have said , " that is a private matter between me and my interns . " Or better : " Young lady , I am the President of the United States , and you should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such thing . He answered the question , looking , to his credit , suitably embarrassed .
