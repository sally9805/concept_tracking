<p> THERE is a poster in the foyer of Die Distel , east Berlin 's premier political cabaret theater , with a drawing of Karl Marx . The solemn father of communism is shrugging his shoulders : " Sorry guys , it was just an idea . " <p> The poster was printed a year before the fall of the Berlin wall , but , quite understandably , did not appear in Die Distel 's foyer until afterward . <p> The woman I am meeting in the same foyer also did not appear at Die Distel until after the dramatic events of 1989 . She could not . In spite - or rather , because - of her fame as the doyen of East German political cabaret , she was officially banned from performing at the high-profile venue . <p> Gisela Oechelhaeuser is today Die Distel 's artistic chief . She has been doing political cabaret for more than 25 years , working in small clubs and heading a theater school during her long stretch in Communist Party-enforced obscurity . <p> Upon leaving Leipzig University with a doctorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paths : academia or political cabaret . In the end , it was n't really a difficult choice . " I wanted to give what I was thinking to other people , " she offers simply . " Theory was n't enough . Art is much more concrete than science or literature - more effective , too . " <p> Oechelhaeuser is a high-octane , sharp-witted woman who grasps not only an interviewer 's query but any subtle nuance behind the question . She takes an intensive English class for several hours every morning , rewrites and rehearses her show in the afternoon , and performs in the evening , six days a week . <p> " Gisela is absolutely the energy behind Die Distel , " says fellow ensemble player Michael Nitzel . " She takes in everything around her , and you just have to go with her . She 's a dynamo . " <p> Wolfgang Bahro , the only " Wessy " ( slang for west German ) in the four-player Die Distel team , has worked extensively with both west and east German political kabarettists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that success is often accompanied by an unwitting accretion of the very thing they are supposed to be inveighing against : money , " two homes , two cars " as he puts it , and somewhere along the way performers lose that hard-hitting political edge . Not so , Oechelhaeuser . According to her colleagues , the more successful she is , the harder she seems to work to put across her ideals . <p> " Gisela is definitely the most important figure in the business today , " Bahro says . <p> Indeed , although Oechelhaeuser laughs heartily and often , she views the social function of a political kabarettist with utmost earnestness . " We are like a psychotherapist or priest , " she remarks . " I want to give the people in the audience the opportunity to know how many possibilities for their lives there are - to broaden their vision . " <p> Before 1989 , an East German political kabarettist had a strict censorship committee to contend with . Oechelhaeuser 's eyes light up with mischievous amusement as she recalls the mental gymnastics she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think up ways to get pointedly sardonic observations about life under communism past the censors . <p> With all that gone , some of the west German cultural critics and commentators I spoke to expressed the view that the main topics left for Oechelhaeuser and her colleagues at Die Distel are largely centered around the past - life in the shadow of the omnipresent Stasi , or secret police , being the biggest issue . These commentators say such east German cabarets as Die Distel have little direct relevance for them . <p> OECHELHAEUSER strongly disagrees . These kind of superficial - as she views them - perceptions prove all the more to her the vital need for her work today . <p> It annoys her as well as makes her profoundly unhappy when west Germans automatically assume that now , with the country reunited under a democratic system , easterners should just forget the past , forget who they are and just become westerners . <p> " Look , I am what I am , " Oechelhaeuser says , with considerable feeling , tapping the table with her forefinger for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red communist school , in the first row , and I have lived here in east Berlin ; I have borne kids here ; and I am the age of 50 and have had to live here all my life . That is my history . And I am absolutely so sad when it 's said that all these years I spent in this country are now thrown away , as if they never existed . <p> " That 's what the west Germans say to us : ' Forget about history ; now we have the future , the Federal Republic of Germany , and you are also a member of that republic and should become more like us . ' But it 's wrong , tragic , and simply not possible to throw the past away . " <p> One of the important themes in Oechelhaeuser 's cabaret show is , in fact , the German tendency , as she describes it , of " disowning the past . " <p> Cabaret colleague Wolfgang Bahro , who has joined us in the tiny office where we are talking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " As a Wessy , I know that nobody , or very few people , in west Germany are interested in discussions about the Stasi or the Communist Party or the Politburo , because they think it 's not their history , and they do n't want to be involved in that history . But , of course , the east is part of Germany , and the west should realize that . We have got two hist ories now - Nazism and communism . " <p> Carrying the idea further , he refers to the end of their show , when the ensemble sings a particularly witty ditty about this very subject , to the tune of the Beatles hit , " Yesterday . " <p> The typical east German today denies having ever belonged to the Communist Party ; yet , as the lyrics remind the audience , there were , until the fall of the Wall , nearly 2-1/2 million party members . The song is sung as if the singer was the only person in the whole country - the one lone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been a Communist . Parallels with an analogous situation in 1945 are not lost . <p> ' AFTER the war , " Oechelhaeuser explains , " suddenly everybody was an antifascist . Nobody was a Nazi . So everyone asked , ' Where are the Nazis ? ' It 's the exact same thing right now in east Germany . That 's why we do the song in our show , so that people will remember ' yesterday . ' We must learn from history . " <p> But neither Oechelhaeuser nor her kabarettist colleagues hold out a great deal of hope for the lessons of the past to sink easily into the minds of the vast majority . <p> Bahro , for example , recalls the 1970s American TV miniseries , " Holocaust , " which attempted to depict the horrors of the death camps during the Third Reich . Bahro was shocked - not by the series , which he felt was tame in comparison to what actually happened - but by the reaction of his fellow countrymen . <p> " So many people phoned the TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ; I did n't know it was so terrible , that it was so bad , " ' he says . " That is what shocked me : the idiotic stupidity of the people . After the war , there has been so much material concerning that period , if someone wanted to learn about it . So I just could n't understand , as a German , that there has to be , first , an American serial to show the Germans their history . I think that 's absolutely disgusting . And now the exact same thing h appens again . Maybe there will have to be an American movie about communism and the history of East Germany . And everybody will say , ' I did n't know that ! ' This is the mentality of the German people . " <p> Tens of thousands of east Germans have long since abandoned their homes for the west . Oechelhaeuser also sees it as an important part of her job to convince the rest that , rather than leave , they should stay and help change their society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she herself is trying to do . <p> " My mother always used to say , ' Where God put me , I stay , ' so I stay where I 'm needed , " she says with determination , " and I 'm working like a lion . But you feel very happy to know that you are needed . "
