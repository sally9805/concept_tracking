Nearly consumed by a harrowing childhood , Grace 's Brett Butler found survival through comedy // NOT LONG AGO , BRETT BUTLER RECEIVED A LETTER from a 15-year-old fan who said she had been sexually abused by her stepfather . " She enclosed a picture of herself , and it was agony to look at , " Butler says . " She was holding a teddy bear and looking so damaged . " Immediately , Butler sent back a copy of one of her favorite books-I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , Maya Angelou 's autobiography about her own sexual abuse-and urged the girl to seek therapy . " Later her mom wrote to say the book had come at a very opportune time , " says Butler , pausing a moment to reflect . " I was so thankful she had a mom who even knew what opportune meant .

In 1994 , after a yearlong separation , she and husband Ken Zeiger , 35 , a contract lawyer and composer , reconciled , and are sharing a Los Angeles home . Meanwhile , Butler , as she makes clear in her just-published autobiography , Knee Deep in Paradise ( excerpted on page 108 ) , has at last managed to make peace with a stormy history that has included an absent father , a violent first husband , alcoholism and drug abuse . " I wanted to write about an interesting life without blaming anyone else for the misfortunes , " she says . " I 've come to terms with the fact that I 'm an interesting broad with a salty past . " Born in Montgomery , Ala. , the oldest of three daughters , she was 4 when her father , Roland Decatur Anderson Jr. , an oil-company executive , moved the family to Houston . It was there that his increasingly erratic behavior-including drinking and emotional and physical abuse directed at Butler 's mother , Carol-led Carol to pack up the girls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the family was living in Marietta , Ga. , with Carol 's second husband , an insurance salesman she identifies as " Joe " in her memoir , and two new half sisters .

" It is how my family always dealt with things , " explains Carol . " We did n't have it easy for a long time . " Adds Brett : " I used to lie awake wondering if my sisters had lunch money , if their clothes were clean . " Even as she sometimes laughed her way through the pain-she and her sisters did impersonations and put on sketches for their family-Butler foun other consolations : drinking , smoking pot , having sex .

They both loved drinking an ( the Allman Brothers , and they married three months later . The honeymoon was short-lived : One day after they exchanged " I dos , " Butler received the first in a long series of beatings . " We were young , we had rage , " says Butler , explaining that the violence usually occurred when she and Wilson were drunk . " Both of us participated in the sickness of it . " Once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hea to toe , " Wilson , feeling remorseful , called her into the living room . " He had a shotgun in his mouth and his toe on the trigger , " Butler says . " I sat there saying , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry " ' " He put the gun down . Like many battered wives , Butler blamed herself for her husband 's behavior , but in 1981 something snapped : Noticing a pipe wrench under the kitchen sink , she fought the urge to bludgeon Wilson as he slept on the couch and phoned her mother to come pick her up . A few months later , Butler broke off the relationship for good during a meeting at a motel that culminated in Wilson 's firing a rifle at her and missing . Since then , he has both admitted and adamantly denied battering Butler , while claiming that she too was violent . " His revisionism is morally outraging , " says Butler . " I never struck back .

" In 1987-the same year she made her debut on The Tonight Show-they married . Butler moved to Hollywood after producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner approached her in 1992 with the idea for her own sitcom . But with her burgeoning career stretching the marriage to the breaking point , Zeiger stayed back in New York . Then , two years ago , while researching her father 's life for her book ( he died in 1979 ) , she realized that her dad was n't the only man missing from her life .
