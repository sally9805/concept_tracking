When George W. Bush swept into Washington last week , the Republican Party establishment threw itself at his feet . Thirty-six G.O.P. Senators , 100 Congressmen and 2,000 well-tailored donors , many of them lobbyists , all paid homage to the Texas Governor  --  a capital reception so warm and so lucrative that even the composed candidate seemed caught up in the hype . To the fawning Congressmen he gushed , " I look forward to working with you , " as though he had already been elected President . And he has reason to be cocky . By the end of this week , he will have raised more than $20 million  --  as much as all his G.O.P. rivals combined  --  in less than four months . <P> But could there be a downside to Bush 's embrace by his party 's leaders  --  and by the corporate special interests who lobby them ? Arizona Senator John McCain , Bush 's rival for the G.O.P. nomination , is counting on it . While Bush was being hailed by the political-financial complex , McCain was plotting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in politics , in part , by pounding his head against the wall of campaign-finance reform . So far , his efforts have been thwarted by his Republican colleagues in Congress . But this week McCain will launch the battle from a different perch , in a campaign speech at the old town hall in Bedford , N.H. , the state holding the first presidential primary . <P> The moment will be poignant , even as some may try to dismiss it as pointless . Senator Mitch McConnell , the Kentucky Republican who has led the three-year fight against McCain 's bill , loves to say , " This issue has never defeated anyone in the American political process . " Nor has it ever launched a presidential campaign . Back in January even McCain 's top advisers hoped to persuade him that campaign-finance reform was a loser issue . They quietly commissioned a poll of G.O.P. voters in four key primary states to prove their point . But when the results came in , they showed 60% of voters saying campaign-finance reform was important , vs. just 15% saying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says John Weaver , McCain 's political director . <P> Bush , for his part , bemoans the culture of partisanship and gridlock in Washington but is mostly silent about the system that funds it . He proposes lifting the $1,000 limit on individual contributions and requiring full disclosure of contributors . But , says McCain , " that 's basically the system we have today . The restrictions we have now are a facade . " The Senator 's current plan , in his McCain-Feingold bill , would ban the unlimited contributions known as " soft money " that corporations , lobbyists and unions can give to national parties , and it would restrict outside , allegedly " independent " groups from running ads to help specific candidates . <P> But for McCain 's reform plan to resonate with grass-roots Republicans , he must pitch it in explicitly conservative terms . " You 're never going to get a simpler , flatter tax code unless you reform the way we finance our campaigns , " McCain says . " And you 're never going to get rid of pork-barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests that dominate our political process . " Sources close to McCain say he and his co-sponsor , Democrat Russ Feingold of Wisconsin , will threaten to bring Senate business to a halt this month unless G.O.P. leaders bring up the bill for debate and a vote .
