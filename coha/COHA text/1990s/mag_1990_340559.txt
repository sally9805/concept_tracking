PACIFIC DESTINY : INSIDE ASIA TODAY <P> by Robert Elegant <P> Crown ; 533 pages ; $24.95 <P> A sociopolitical primer on Asia may seem anachronistic when the world is entranced by the promise of a democratized Central Europe . But Robert Elegant 's anecdote-encrusted new book is a reminder that the West , rejuvenated though it may be by freedom , still faces its major challenge in the aggressive economies of Asia . Culled from the author 's more than two decades as a correspondent for Newsweek and the Los Angeles Times , Pacific Destiny is a cautionary travelogue that weaves expertise with exotica to analyze why the unquestioned superiority of the West  --  and the U.S. in particular  --  is passing . <P> The preachings of the liberal West , Elegant argues , are undermined by the effectiveness of authoritarian Neo-Confucianism from Seoul to Tokyo to Taipei , from Beijing to Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur . Japan 's energy comes from a disciplined adherence to the hierarchical loyalties demanded by the ancient philosophy . In Singapore , Lee Kuan Yew reigns as a benevolent but stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of  --  Park Chung Hee , the dictator who laid the foundations for his country 's phenomenal economic expansion . Though Elegant does not quite make the argument , the Confucian ethic , with its emphasis on obedience , can justify the Tiananmen crackdown . Deng Xiaoping is said to have modeled China 's reforms on Park 's repressive yet ultimately fruitful policies . <P> Elegant , who draws on the tradition of the John Gunther series that included Inside Europe Today , is tirelessly entertaining . His recollection of Indonesia under the demagogic strongman Sukarno casts history as comedy . His chapter on Australia is a lesson on how charm , wit and isolationism can not save a country from the effects of economic lassitude . Nevertheless , the book is flawed by a few of the author 's quirks . He tries to imbue various transliterations of China 's capital with poetry , alternating " Peking " ( for the citadel redolent with the imperial past ) with " Beijing " ( for the colorless communist metropolis ) . It is an unnecessarily romantic subtlety made more confusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He also provides one questionable historical interpretation of a 17th century border treaty between Moscow and Beijing . But these are quibbles . Those who wish to divine the shape of the future will do well to look to Asia and into Pacific Destiny .
