Since she 's not in a hurry  --  not ever , anymore  --  Lydia Zimmer takes time to read the signs . Loose Carrots , Cherry Tomatoes , Pickling Cukes . She nods , stopping her cart by a bin . Purple Top Turnips , Lemon Curd . And she squints , her eyes in the mornings clear but dry . California Seedless . Another cart pushes around her , a young mother with wild unbrushed hair or maybe it 's supposed to look that way . <p> " Ex-cuse me , " the mother mutters over her bare shoulder . <p> " Accuse me , " Lydia murmurs back , gripping the handle of her cart with both hands . Bare-armed and bare-legged and smelling frankly of sweat , the mother noses her own cart between Loose Carrots and Lemon Curd . Supermarket lights drain her white-blond hair of shine and color . Her blond fuzzy-headed baby is whimpering . Its hair , too , looks dyed . And could that be a thin cigarette in its lips ? <p> Lydia squints . Dyed , died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she licks her dry lips  --  a quick lizard flick of her tongue . What she does these days instead of smiling , in public . <p> She loves , has always loved , shopping alone . Years ago , evenings , she longed for the fluorescent supermarket stillness , the smell of cheese and apples , the company of mute food . She 'd leave the kids with Sid , sneak off on weeknights , lingering a bit even then , when she had to be back by nine to herd the kids into bed , Sid konked out on the couch . His snores sounded vigorous , impatient . <p> Lyd , he 'd always say , chopping short her mother 's lilting name . Lyd and Sid , he liked to introduce them , as if she were jaunty and full of fun , too , as if she were n't , in fact , a true Lydia . Tending her violets , filing out her daily crosswords , settling into long intent Scrabble matches with her dear mother , dead now , her one worthy opponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemingly tense . Secretly serene . <p> Look alive , Lyd , Sid was always saying in his last year , when he 'd tag along to the supermarket , startling her from her trances . We have n't got , he 'd claim , all day . <p> It 's 9 A.M. or so , the aisles near empty . Thank the Lord . Lydia picks at a filmy plastic bag , inching apart the layers , thin as onion skin . But strong , stretchable . <p> She lifts a head of lettuce , Iceberg  --  pleasantly frosty and light . Her knees ache . A garden : that 's what she never got , never will get , up on the 33rd floor . Just three furry African violets . Lights hum now like the sunlamp she switches on once a day for them . Her shy Vis . <p> " Lah-leeee  --  " <p> With effort , Lydia turns her head to see the fuzzy dye-haired baby hurl its cigarette into the Loose Carrots . No smoke . Lollipop stick , is it ? Sucked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while  --  Lydia strains her eyes , her vision still and always sharp  --  while its mother paws through the frozen meat , bent in her halter top , her shoulder blades standing out . Firm flesh , savagely tan . Lydia herself had hurried through Meat and its brutal signs . <p> Hog Maws , Bottom Round Rump Roast . <p> Slowly , Lydia turns her back on the bawling baby , hungry baby . A relief , these days , to turn away . Her head . hums . Simulated African sun , a mere ghost of the real thing . Poor thing ' ; . No wonder their purple has dulled to lavender , an old-lady color , pretty and pale , the sort Lydia wears but never did like . <p> She sets the lettuce in her cart , looks at it . Blinks , her lids sticking . Is she going to eat this ? Ever ? She works her jaw . The whole idea of chewing seems impossibly strenuous . She blinks again , a faint burning inside her eyes . <p> Red meat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected sway , Lydia pictures the bushy-haired young mother bent over an open fire , tearing meat with her teeth , chewing it up and spitting it out into her baby 's gaping mouth . Hard to imagine a saintly toothless bird doing such a thing . Firelight would flicker , the mother 's bare flesh gleaming . Under her clothes , Lydia used to work up a delicate sweat in their small overheated kitchen , plump and busy . At the table , she 'd slice the children 's meat , chew her own . At the other end , Sid would bend over his plate . Careful to keep his mouth closed , for her . My , how he loved his Sunday roast . How he tried , in his last years , to keep loving it , keep chewing , shifting his teeth every few bites . Funny thing , she does n't miss them much , her own . Inside her mouth , her tongue touches her upper plate . It sticks . <p> Lettuce , shredded wheat , milk to soften the shredded wheat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluorescent bulbs humming . How do they connect ? <p> She shuffles forward another step , so hard to lift her feet in her heavy rubber-soled shoes . A dirty brown root confronts her : a ham-sized root , chopped off at both ends from the looks of it . In the earth , it would plunge and plunge . Above its bin hangs a helpful sign : Peel and Boil . <p> Lydia blinks , trying to wet her eyes , blur the words . Too many words today , too much to know . Early this morning , as her cereal soaked in milk , its box tried to tell her , persuade her , that she might want to melt cheese and tuna fish  --  tuna fish !  --  over a square of shredded wheat . A Tasty Treat ! She 'd pitched the box straight into the trash , half full though it was . <p> " Lah-leee  --  " that kid is still squawling . Someone else 's job to feed it , thank Lord . Lydia licks her lips . If an old lady alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> "  --  up , hush up or I 'll smack you  --  Want me t ' smack you ? " <p> Yes , presumably . A small sound in the vast near-empty market . As if to make up for the disappointing smallness of the smack , the baby manages a hoarse howl that stiffens Lydia 's shoulders , sets a crick in her neck as she starts to turn her head , then stops herself , confused , picturing its hot red face streaming . Wanting to touch that fresh wetness and yet at the same time glad she does n't have to . <p> Hot red meat . She bows over her cart , shuffles forward , shivering under her blue cotton dress . Her flesh feels , these days , like a form of cloth : another thin inadequate covering . The straps of her brassiere bite into her ribs , the cups only half filled . It 's her bones that ache . Not her flesh so much , anymore . <p> "  --  leee  --  Wan leeee  --  " <p> Lydia stops to rub her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to think of salad . Something hot , instead . Chopped vegetables simmering together in her old iron pot . That makes sense , does n't it ? Even in summer ? The baby stops sobbing , abruptly  --  another pop stuffed in its mouth no doubt . Lydia bends into Idaho 's Finest , the nipples of her breasts faintly tingling . Stew , she thinks . Along with the word , she grips a potato . Hefts it , solid and dusty . Hold it , Lyd . Please hold it ? Sid 's slow soft wheedling salesman voice , the roast and onion smell on his breath and sometimes , hushing him , she 'd take it in her hands . Swollen and smooth , a rich dark purple , her favorite color . In a way , she liked it better in her hands , where she could touch it , stroke it , take her time . <p> She sets the potato gently in the cart , on the plastic baby seat beside the Iceberg head . No bag ; she does n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it and the lettuce together , something missing . <p> " ' Scuse us , dear ! Another Mother for Peace bends over Lydia 's cart , grips two potatoes in one knuckly hand . Her T-shirt stretches on her broad back , the bright pink words plain to see , no bra straps digging into her shoulders . Her hair hangs down , straight and brown . Another Mother . Lydia feels her cart jostle as this Mother straightens , her hair brushing Lydia 's arm , her unbound breasts bouncing . Flesh melons . Her chunky brown-haired daughter stares along with Lydia . Lydia 's breasts were more like peaches , really , not much bigger than that . Lydia squints down at her potato , its pinched underworld eyes . <p> "  --  Wan one too ! " Gracelessly , Another Mother 's daughter stretches over Lydia 's cart to grab another potato , her T-shirt shouting its slogan in electric green letters . SAVE THE EARTH . The cart rattles , jarring Lydia 's ribs . Her heart . <p> Lydia stiffens as if one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her the way kids do , hungry for hugs , young and wild all over again . As if Sid himself had n't been enough of a handful . Lydia clicks her tongue , remembering potato eyes gone wild , a sack of potatoes she 'd bought and-forgotten  --  someday she 'd forget her head , Sid used to say  --  and one morning Sid had burst into the bathroom when she was in the tub , waving a monstrous potato head , its green roots vibrating like tentacles , and she 'd shrieked , splashed . <p> Then , even worse  --  Lydia licks her chapped lips twice  --  then there was the time with the pumpkin , canned pumpkin for a pie , quarter of a can left . Stupidly , she 'd forgotten it in the back of the fridge , months maybe , Thanksgiving to Christmas . Dreamy Lyd . Christmas morning in front of everyone , she 'd unwrapped a second gift from Sid , a can , the pumpkin can , a lid Scotch-taped back on top of it and an odd smell wafting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she peeled it open . The girls had shrieked , too , louder than her , though they did n't know yet what it looked like : the orange moldy mushroom thrusting up to the rim of the can and Sid laughing so hard his bald head turned its richest shade of red-purple and for two days , even after a bouquet of white violets , she would n't speak to him , could n't smile . <p> Till now , thirty-some years later . At least Lydia starts to , then stops herself , hopes no one saw . Sorry , though , as she remembers the girls and Sid Junior and Sid whooping and howling with laughter . And what was wrong with her , what was so closed-up and shy , that she could n't smile when they all wanted her to ? Just like her poor mother , another Lydia . <p> "  --  Please , Mommy ? " the daughter ' s voice pipes up , and Lydia keeps her eyes downcast . Ca n't take a joke , Sid had said , hurt in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's voice . Soft and yet not , not at all . Lightly , Lydia touches the potato , its puckered brown face . <p> " Less cal-ories , Mommy , than ba-nan-as  --  " <p> Beside Lydia , the brown-haired daughter stands on tiptoe , her adult-sized glasses sliding down her nose . Her plump elbow bumps Lydia 's bony one . " Pleaseplease , " she insists , clutching her potato , pleading for  --  what ? What on earth ? <p> Lydia 's hands tighten again on the cart handle , greasy plastic pressing her fingerbones . <p> "  --  ' K , greedy girl . " Another Mother sighs , pushing her cart forward . A denim knapsack hangs now from her shoulder . Side by side , the mother and daughter turn a corner : pink Peace , electric green Earth . <p> Lydia , too , takes a shuffling step , ready to follow the blue knapsack out of Vegetables . She stops , sucks in her breath . No weight dangles from her own elbow . Had she set it down somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Her shiny black purse ? She blinks and her eyelids almost stick together , so dry . <p> " Make way  --  " sings a low husky voice , a young black boy , a bag boy Lydia 's seen before . Has n't she ? He jostles her cart , but gently , wheeling a tray of plastic berry baskets , his head bobbing . Strawberries , yes . That sweet heady juicy smell , much fainter now than it used to be . " Make way plea-ease  --  " <p> Must everyone , these days , give the same sly half-mocking emphasis to the dearest old words ? Sorry , please . ' <p> " ' Cuse me , " Lydia rasps , her tongue all at once dry , and she half shuffles , half staggers forward , forgetting to turn . She leans on her cart , staring down into it . Shredded wheat , lettuce , potato . How do they , did they , ever connect ? <p> Peel &; Boil . <p> But what ? Like a rowboat running ashore , her cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear wall bin , lit up white . She squints , starts to back away . That 's when she sees it , sees them . Arranged in a row above the Avocados . When she sees them , she stops . Stops moving , stops breathing . <p> White Eggplant . <p> Slowly , two times , she reads those two words . Those letters . Scrabble squares , meaningless in themselves . Refusing to connect , make sense . Eagerly , she moves her eyes back down to the eggplants , set out in a row alone , arranged on their shredded green cellophane like Easter eggs , outer-space eggs . Something from another world , all white . They glow in their skins . <p> If an egg was a vegetable , was alive . Slowly , painfully , Lydia Zimmer bends forward over her cart . She reaches out as if this is the last reach she 'll ever attempt . She touches the eggplant as if it 's the last thing she 'll ever touch , the last she 'd ever want to touch , hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ louder than the lights , she cradles the eggplant in both hands , strokes it like a breast in silk . That same weight . Years ago , in secret , she used to stroke her own full breasts in her silk nursing nightgown . Never again would she feel that softness . But this in its way is better , is perfect . on this eggplant , the silk is the flesh , one and the same . Its texture is slippery smooth yet not slippery at all . oily yet not that , either . Lush . Silk made flesh . She can almost hear , almost feel the dense squishy mass of seeds inside , perfectly sealed . She keeps stroking the skin , shining it , drinking in with her eyes its creamy white sheen . Her knees wobble . <p> A stem presses through Lydia 's dress , pokes her stomach just above her sunken navel , the stem prickly where it was chopped from the vine . <p> Might become a vegetable , they 'd said of Sid after his last attack , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he died , it was seen as a blessing . A vegetable , other old ladies say , their voices quavering in fear . But , funny thing , Lydia Zimmer would n't mind , not really , not if she could become this vegetable , this eggplant , purest white . <p> Even harsh supermarket lights ca n't fade its color , ca n't diminish it . Its white is n't a bit like the yellowish white of Lydia 's hair , drained of natural brown . No , this white is a color all its own , as rich in its own way as the deep purple of a regular eggplant . A color Lydia once had loved , long ago , a word she once had loved , secretly , one that began with the sound but not the letter . <p> Oh , Lydia mouths in surprise . Mild surprise . All at once she is sitting on the supermarket floor by the sticky rubber wheels of her cart , leaning against the refrigerated cool of the rear wall bin . A relief to her knee bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Sid used to say , when he 'd gotten skinny and old himself  --  since she has no butt left at all , her tailbone presses the cold hard floor . Too much trouble to pull herself up . To pull herself up , she 'd have to let go and she never wants to let go of it , this beautiful thing she 's found at last . <p> Above her , the bag boy bends in his white smock , his motion brushing her skin , his brown face gleaming . The whites of his eyes gleam , too , painfully expectant like Sid Junior 's eyes when he 'd skid into the kitchen , panting , asking what was there to eat . or Sid himself , his oldest face , those last months when she 'd inch out into the waiting room after talking to the doctor alone . He 'd stare up at her , wanting her to tell him , as she always did , that he was going to be all right . <p> Peace , please . The bag boy seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying . It 's as if she does n't have her hearing aid on , but of course she does . <p> Oh , she mouths again , this time to herself , still stroking the rich white skin , richer than any purple . How satisfying it is to hold , this shape : oval and yet not , its subtle curves not evenly balanced . Its curves too smooth to be called lumps . Pear-shaped , yes , only more so . Rounder , fuller . A shape all its own , lopsided and whole . Oh , Burr-something . She lowers her eyes and the white blurs . Oh , Burr , and then a name , a name that could be both a man 's and a woman 's . Luminous white , lunar white . Moon grown . Cool plush moondust on her fingertips . Oh , Burr  --  <p> Above her , hopelessly blurred , Another Mother waves something shiny and black and square . The brown-haired Earth daughter is bouncing on her heels in excitement , her glasses agleam like the boy 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat finger at Lydia Zimmer . How rude to point when everyone 's staring at her already , are n't they ? Lydia blinks , feels on her dry cheek a slight delicious trickle . <p> Another Mother hands the shiny square to the bag boy , holding it by its straps , trying to tell him something but he wo n't listen as he should . He turns instead to Lydia , bends down so dose she catches a whiff of his spicy sweat . He 's hugging the black square to his chest and speaking again , enunciating clearly , his thick-lipped mouth opening like a baby bird 's . Ca n't he see she 's through with all that she 's done all that ? Ca n't he see ? <p> Skin and bones , all that 's left . She lowers her eyes again . Its skin , so much thicker than her own , begins to grow warm in her hands . Her cold hands . oh , Burr . . . oh , Burr . She squeezes shut her eyes , feels another soothing trickle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid salt , and she licks again , feeding herself now , only herself . She presses it close to her stomach , thinking : Jean , Gene . And she clicks her tongue , secretly pleased , not caring how it connects , if it connects . Someone touches her shoulder but she has no intention of moving . She keeps hold of it , stroking its smooth cool sealed-up softness . Why rush ' She 's got , finally got  --  they ca n't take it  --  all day . <p> <p> By Elizabeth Searle <p>
