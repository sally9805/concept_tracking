Rushed to the hospital , Epstein lost several fingers on his right hand , broke an arm and suffered severe abdominal injuries . <P> Two days later , David Gelernter , an associate professor of computer science at Yale , received a package at his office in the college 's computer-science center . It blew up in his hands . Wounded in the abdomen , chest , right eye and hands , he ran downstairs to a nearby university medical clinic , leaving a trail of blood behind him . <P> At first the timing of the bicoastal explosions seemed only coincidental .
