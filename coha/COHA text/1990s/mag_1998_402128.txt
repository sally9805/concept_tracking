From the concrete canyons of New York City to the suburbs of Cincinnati , the U.S. is flush with royals and nobles . Most are exiles-or their descendants-driven from their kingdoms and duchies by revolutions or coups . They are employed-most need to work-as bankers , photographers , politicians , even cops . They ride buses and buy their own groceries . Some live in posh penthouses , others in rented walkups . But , as the profiles on the following pages attest , no matter how well our regal neighbors have taken to their adopted country , their pride in their homelands is undiminished . // Prince Amof Nyabongo For now , this descendant of Ugandan royalty prefers to patrol the streets of Brooklyn as a New York City cop " The only thing I inherited is a rich culture , " says Prince Amoti K.

" I like the idea of being accepted for who I am , " he says . The only child of the late Akki Hosea Nyabongo , a former North Carolina A &T; State University professor , Amoti was reared by his Bermudan schoolteacher mother , Ada , after his father returned to Toro to help write its constitution . He never came back . " I ca n't fault him , " says Nyabongo , a 1981 graduate in sociology from Alabama 's Tuskegee University , who visited his father for the first time in 1972 . " I got to see his work , meet the people-he made a difference in their lives . " With 15 years on the police force behind him , Nyabongo someday plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1993 .

No explanation needed : Among Russian emigres , Chavchavadze 's lineage has always been revered .
