Confused by the threat to impose sanctions on North Korea ? Wonder why the shrewd ( or mad ) father and son who rule Pyongyang would scrap their nuclear- weapons program in the face of measures that have had little effect on less menacing dictators ? Join the club . <P> Sanctions are a fashion , rising or falling like hemlines , depending on who 's running things in Washington . Bill Clinton 's reflexive faith in their efficacy is hardly surprising , since he is the No. 1 proponent of the post-cold war 's leading fallacy : economic might counts far more than military clout . The quintessential domestic President , Clinton sees everyone as he sees Americans : as bourgeois consumers whose behavior is driven by economic concerns . The idea that bad guys are interested only in raw power , and dissuaded only by countervailing power , seems lost on him . At this rate , Clinton may soon echo the words of a President whose penchant for muddleheaded multinationalism he much admires . " A nation that is boycotted is a nation in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Apply this peaceful , silent , deadly remedy , and there will be no need for force . " <P> North Korea 's Kims see sanctions as an act of war , which technically they are . For that reason alone , but especially because the North fought America to a standstill 40 years ago , it 's important to understand what economic warfare can  --  and can not  --  do . <P> Those few sanctions that have worked during the past century had several things in common : the strong imposed them on the weak ; allies rather than enemies were the target ( as when economic pressure helped the U.S. force the French and British from the Suez in 1956 ) ; and , most important , the goal did not strike at the core of a nation 's identity  --  sanctions designed to compel the release of kidnapped diplomats , for example , do not challenge vital interests . But when the underlying objective is nothing less than regime toppling , even tinhorn dictators have successfully resisted sanctions . Cuba 's Castro has survived for 35 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed him . Haiti 's military thugs promised their resignations when George Bush imposed sanctions in 1991 , but they reneged after concluding that ! Clinton lacked the guts to take them out . The same goes for Serbia . <P> The lesson is clear : leaders who command repressive police states , and who could n't care less about their citizens ' economic status , dig in . If the prospect of military intervention is perceived as remote , they quickly come to believe that the will of the international community can be successfully ignored as long as there 's money to be made in the smuggling business , which there always is . Local pride , too , often works to support those who defy sanctions ; misplaced nationalism sometimes causes oppressed people to rally round their leaders rather than succumb to pressure from outsiders .
