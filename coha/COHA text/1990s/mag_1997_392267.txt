As you would expect , Tom Kite is in complete control heading into the Ryder Cup // United States Ryder Cup team trailed by a single point as they started play on the final day at The Bel in 1993 . Things quickly worsened , as Europe led four of the five early singles matches . Right behind were two duels whose outcomes were excitingly uncertain : Davis Love III versus Costantino Rocca and Ray Floyd versus Jose Maria Olazabal . Captain Tom Watson sent his players out in ascending order according to the ice water in their veins . Tom Kite was in the second-tolast match . The 10th hole at The Belfry is a teaser , a mere 267yard , downhill par four . The safety-minded play with a mid-iron layup and a sand wedge . The daredevils take a wood and fly it over the trees and try to hit the tiny green without landing in the flower bed behind or the water in front . When Kite arrived at the tee and took the cover off his 3-wood , the 10-deep throng inhaled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot straight at the target . The bravest shot in Ryder Cup history made it to the green and the two-putt birdie put Kite three-up in his match against Bernhard Langer . The little man from Austin , Texas , won his battle 5 and 3 . The U.S. won the war , 15-13 . Thomas Oliver Kite , swashbuckler . This is not the Tom Kite we thought we knew . Usually the phrases " overachiever " or " golf 's CPA " are trotted out to describe him-and put his teeth on edge . Maybe it 's the glasses . Perhaps it 's the mechanical look of his swing or his devotion to the practice tee . But in Ryder Cup singles , where the breathing gets really heavy , Kite 's no nerd . In beating Sandy Lyle 3 and 2 in 1983 , he was 10 under for 16 holes at Walton Heath . He 's never lost a Ryder Cup singles match . Besides Langer , his victims have included Lyle ( twice ) , Tony Jacklin , and Howard Clark ( by an 8-and-7 margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Captain Kite , he will put his stamp on the 1997 U.S. team . Will his imprint reflect the discipline that won him a U.S. Open and makes him the PGA Tour 's second leading money winner of all time ? Or will it reflect the daring of the man who drove the 10th green-twice-in the 1993 Ryder Cup ? " Hitting the green on 10 in ' ' 93 were the two best shots I ever hit in the Ryder Cup , " says Kite , who also drove the green in a foursomes match ( more on that later ) . " But there 's no way you 'd say that was good strategy . I had just birdied nine to go two-up against Bernhard and I knew we needed a point . But I believe in hunches . You should never take away a player 's instinct . " On the other hand , " As captain , what I want is to be prepared . Watson did an excellent job . Jack Nicklaus , as you 'd guess , was extremely prepared . " Kite already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the golf course going to play in different wind conditions ? The Europeans have seen Valderrama ( the site of the Ryder Cup and formerly of the Volvo Masters in Spain ) in every condition . It has lots of doglegs , overhanging trees , and greens with slopes and different levels , similar to Augusta National . How will that affect us ? None of our guys have seen it . That 's our huge disadvantage . " Kite puts down his glass of iced tea , purses his lips , and blows-a familiar gesture , one he uses after he has made a difficult point . " I 'm trying to coordinate a trip to Spain for potential team members around the British Open to play some practice rounds at Valderrama , " he says . " It has n't been a nightmare , but it has been a challenge . We all travel around the world by ourselves and we do it quite well . But as a group , we 're pathetic . " Editor 's Note : The week before the Open , Kite took six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being captain is not driving Kite crazy , as it did his predecessor , Lanny Wadkins . " Lanny told me I 'll have the pairings firmly stamped in my mind , not subject to change , about 150 times , " Kite says . " He also said I 'd have to get a full-time secretary . " Photograph The Kit-Love III team was 1-2 in the ' ' 93 Ryder Cup matches . // While Kite has thought a lot about who should play with or against whom , he has n't obsessed about it And , he has n't hired a secretary . But he does have an assistant coach . A laptop computer and E-mail allow him to instantly answer the PGA of America 's questions about logistics , uniform design , and what appetizer to have with dinner Thursday night . He even designed the team 's logo . " There 's nothing regarding the Ryder Cup that does n't go through me , " he says . Media pressure took its toll on Wadkins . Kite noticed . " Lanny told me that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kite says . " He got wrapped up in it and his game went south . I made up my mind that was not going to happen to me . I 've had a lot more fun during Ryder Cup interviews when the press has been able to say , Hey , Tom , tell us about your 67 today . " For some reason , after two down years , Kite 's game has gotten better during his captaincy , not worse . He ca n't put his finger on the reason for his ascent to 29th on the U.S. Ryder Cup points list as of early August . The top 10 automatically qualify for the team and the captain chooses two other players . " That would be pretty gutsy , " he says in response to the obvious question . " No , I ca n't see myself as one of the captain 's picks . What I want is to play so well I make the top 10 and impress the hell out of the captain . " If he 's not the player-captain , the highlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his second-place finish in The Masters , where he was edged by a mere 12 shots by Tiger Woods . " I 'm trying to get Tiger to be part of the team , " Kite says . " He could win the maximum ( five points ) and we might come back without the cup . We have to remember that other guys have talent and egos , too . The challenge is to make everyone feel important . " Another obvious challenge for the captain is to pair his players correctly . " In alternate shot foursomes , you should pair similar games together , " Kite says . " When Andy Bean and I were partners in 1979 , Kite 's first Ryder Cup appearance , I hit it way too short off the tee for him and he hit it a mile , but in the rough . We got beat 6 and 5 by Nick Faldo and Peter Oosterhuis . And , I do n't think you should put a timid putter with an aggressive putter . The timid guy is not going to like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the pain of playing on two losing teams , including the first team to lose on American soil , at Muir bid Village in 1987. // " No , I do n't know who I will pair with Tiger . Whose game is similar to his ? " Kite seems calm and prepared , but he admits he is more excited " than for any Masters or PGA or Open . I 've played in 100 majors , but just seven Ryder Cups . " When Kite talks , half the time you hear Harvey Penick . " The best part about golf is that if you observe the etiquette , you can always find a game , " Kite 's sainted mentor wrote in his Little Red Book . " Sportsmanship is the most important thing in the Ryder Cup , " Kite says-and says it again . " It 's the most important thing . I 've made some tremendous friendships through it , like with Sam Torrance and Sandy Lyle . " What Kite does not want is the War By The Shore mentality that permeated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played in the same year as the Gulf War ; some U.S. team members wore hats decorated with camouflage and fans were in a college football-type mood . " I think Dave Stockton and Bernard Gallacher would agree that things got out of hand , " Kite says . " But things are back in control now . " Although Kite can sound as lowkey as Penick , he is a much edgier man than his late teacher was , far more competitive and under greater pressure . Kite 's native leave-me-alone determination is at odds with the gentleness he learned from Penick . While he 's no Mr. Sunshine after a poor round , Kite is the master of his emotions and if ever there was a test for such control , it 's the Ryder Cup . And if ever there was a man to make an opponent mad enough to spit , it 's the European captain-Ballesteros . Seve 's gamesmanship has become Ryder Cup legend . " My relationship with Seve is very good , with lots of kidding back and forth , " Kite says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cup was on display . Seve said , This is as close as you 'll get . ' ' " Kite made a much stronger statement at The Belfry in 1993 when the captains-to-be faced each other in a first-day foursomes match . Kite was paired with Love and Ballesteros with long-time partner Olazabal . The Spaniards had won the ninth to go two up and Ballesteros had the honor at the short 10th . Seve laid a hand on a wood and pulled it back . He muttered some Spanish to Olazabal and threw some grass into the air . Finally , he chose an iron and safety . Without hesitation , Kite pulled out his 3-wood and blasted it over the trees to within four feet of the hole . Love made the putt for eagle , which turned the momentum and helped the Americans win the match . You wonder if Kite will remember those shots when he talks to his team . It 's certain that Seve will . Author Affiliation Curt Sampson is the author of Hogan , the biography of Ben Hogan. // <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
