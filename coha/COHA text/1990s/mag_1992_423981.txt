<p> The United States Army has always been secretive about its defense installations . In the summer of 1864 a breach of security took place on the tiny island fortress of Alcatraz that reverberated all the way back to the War Department in Washington . <p> Alcatraz Island , squatting in the middle of San Francisco Bay , is the twenty-two-acre cork in the mouth of The Golden Gate . <p> Beginning in 1853 the U.S. Army 's Corps of Engineers transformed the humpbacked islet into one of the country 's most heavily defended pieces of real estate . The fort continued to grow throughout the early Civil War years , until by the end of 1863 it mounted more than a hundred pieces of heavy artillery . <p> Early in 1864 Capt . William Winder , commanding the " Post on Alcatraz Island , " decided that it was time to have a permanent record made of his fortress . Approaching the San Francisco photography firm of Bradley and Rulofson , the captain offered to pay four hundred dollars in government greenbacks for a photographic survey of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run at least fifteen hundred dollars . After some negotiating , it was agreed that the company would be allowed to make up the cost difference by selling sets of the photographs to the public . <p> In April Bradley and Rulofson sent their premier staff photographer out to Alcatraz . Acting under the personal direction of Captain Winder , he lugged his brassbound view camera to every nook and cranny of the island , eventually exposing two thousand negatives . <p> Upon completion of the work , two sets of prints were made : a partial set for presentation to Gen. Irvin McDowell , the newest commander of the Department of the Pacific , and a complete set of fifty " approved " views for Captain Winder 's staff to review before additional copies were made . Then Bradley and Rulofson printed a descriptive catalogue of their new Alcatraz series and began taking orders from the public . <p> At this time the fort on Alcatraz actually had a dual command structure , and Lt. George Elliot of the Corps of Engineers oversaw the work crews who labored at modernizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of town when the photographs were made , but upon his return he was delighted , for he saw in the pictures an opportunity to document his most recent labors for his superiors in Washington . <p> Elliot sent off a glowing dispatch to Chief of Engineers Richard Delafield , on July 8 , describing the newly taken photographs in vivid terms and including a pair of the pictures that depicted his current job , reinforcing the island 's batteries . " I have thought that you would be glad to obtain copies to illustrate the condition and the progress of my work . .. , " he wrote . He then proceeded to list all the pictures that had been taken . The photographer had been extremely thorough ; the final commercial series contained images revealing in exhaustive detail every building and battery on the island . <p> Lieutenant Elliot 's happy report ignited a fire storm in Washington . The War Department could n't imagine anything more useful to Confederate spies . Upon receiving Elliot 's letter on August 1 , Chief of Engineers Delafield immediately fired off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such photographs were to be " instantly suppressed . " That same day the Chief of Staff of the Army , Gen. Henry Halleck , sent off his own wire , containing a frightening directive : Secretary of War Edwin Stanton had personally ordered the photographs seized . <p> Things moved quickly . Three days later the San Francisco Evening Bulletin ran a story under the headline FORT ALCATRAZ TAKEN ! , which reported that at 4:00 P.M. on August 2 a party of armed soldiers had arrived at the Montgomery Street studios of Bradley and Rulofson . Brandishing orders from the War Department , the soldiers had seized all the photographs , negatives , and correspondence relating to the Alcatraz contract , including the name and address of every customer who had ordered a copy set . <p> On August 5 General McDowell was able to report to Halleck that " the provost-marshall-general has all the negatives and all the copies , except those Elliot sent to the Engineer Department . " Unfortunately for Captain Winder , the incident was far from over ; his personal loyalties were now being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Confederate Army , and commanded the South 's festering prisoner-of-war camps , did little to increase Winder 's credibility . In disgrace , he requested and received a transfer to the tiny artillery post at Point San Jose on the San Francisco waterfront . <p> The Bradley and Rulofson photographs are the earliest-known pictures taken on Alcatraz ; six years would pass before a photographer would again be allowed there . In 1979 the historian Erwin Thompson lamented : " The destruction of the pictures must have been thorough ; no copies of any of them have been found to date , in the National Archives or elsewhere . National security was preserved ; but history was made the poorer . " <p> In early 1987 I was visiting Fort Point National Historic Site beneath the roaring Golden Gate Bridge . While waiting for a meeting to begin , I glanced over articles tacked to the bulletin board in the staff break room . Most of them were identical to those found in any government office , but thumbtacked in the middle of the bureaucratic clutter was something unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a postcard . <p> The image on the card was typical of the reproductions of nineteenth-century photographs sold at historic sites around the country , complete with pseudosepia toning . This particular one , affixed with one of those ubiquitous yellow Post-its , showed a line-up of seacoast cannon mounted in a nineteenth-century American fort ( one of my particular areas of interest ) . I took the postcard off the wall , turned it over , and read the caption : " Fort Point-the Civil War , " with the credit line " Sacramento History Center . " Penciled on the yellow tag was : " Not Fort Point . Where is this ? " <p> The anonymous note was correct . Although the picture showed a battery of Columbiad-pattern cannon identical to those mounted at Fort Point during the Civil War , this particular installation also sported a flanking tower known as a caponier . Two stories tall , it had gunports in its walls for still more cannon and , on its roof , another hulking Columbiad alongside a tiny guard shack with a whimsical little crenelated parapet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were dozens of possible locations for the unidentified battery . The photo might easily have been taken on the Atlantic or Gulf coast , where the Army had erected nearly forty similar fortifications during the first half of the nineteenth century . <p> I mentally filed away the postcard for future investigation . Shortly , however , I found myself doing research for the book Fortress Alcatraz , focusing on the United States Army 's eighty-year occupation of the island before it became a federal penitentiary . In the course of my digging I came across correspondence relating the Bradley and Rulofson scandal , and I was fascinated by the story of the long-destroyed glass plates that had shown in detail America 's most private fortress . <p> My curiosity grew as I reviewed the history of the 1864 controversy . Lieutenant Elliot 's list of Alcatraz photos had described several views of the fort 's two caponiers , and the battery of guns in the Fort Point postcard had been dominated by a looming caponier . I went back to Fort Point to examine the postcard tacked to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park Service . The postcard , after gathering dust on the board for several months , had been dutifully filed away in the Fort Point archives . Unfortunately the person who filed it had transferred to another park , and nearly three years passed before the beleaguered Fort Point staff could relocate the picture . My repeated reminders to ranger colleagues at the fort may have strained several friendships , but in due course the postcard arrived on my desk in early 1990 . <p> By now I could identify the site as the Rock . Not only did the arrangement of gun positions and caponier correspond exactly with an 1863 engineer 's drawing of the island 's batteries , but dimly visible in the background was the unmistakable silhouette of San Francisco 's then-barren sand hills . <p> Another detail convinced me that this was inarguably South Battery , located at the very southern tip of the island : both the caponier itself and an exterior scarp wall visible in one corner of the picture were constructed of blocks of roughhewn stone . The original construction reports for South Battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplier of suitable brick , and in desperation had resorted to using " blue stone " sandstone , quarried on nearby Angel Island , for constructing this battery and its caponier . <p> There was still the possibility that the picture had been taken at a time other than the Bradley and Rulofson scandal . Once again I consulted old records and compared the cannon shown in the photo with the annual " ordnance reports " that recorded which types of guns were mounted where , and when , in the island 's batteries . South Battery , it turned out , was armed entirely with the smooth-bore Columbiads visible in the photo only until August of 1864 , when half of the battery 's emplacements were ripped out during one of Lieutenant Elliot 's modernization projects . The time frame of the photo had narrowed to pre-summer 1864-the period when Captain Winder had been enthusiastically escorting the contract photographer around his fort . What else might the Sacramento History Center  --  the credited holder of the original photograph  --  have in its collection ? When I called to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noyes , a professional archivist who immediately picked up on my enthusiastic , possibly nearmanic , drive for information . <p> Ms. Noyes reported that the picture was one of a series of eight photographs received from a private donor in 1968 , all of which showed " lots of cannons and soldiers . " She read me the caption on the back of one of the photographs : " View from the Citadel showing a section of Parade Ground and Engineers ' Quarters . " The description rang a bell . An entry in Capt . George Elliot 's 1864 list of photos was tantalizingly similar : " View of same the Citadel showing Parade ground and Engineers &Adjutants; Offices " -a close enough match to get my pulse going . Pushing my luck , I asked for photocopies of the pictures . She replied that she 'd send them right off , along with any information she could find on the donor . <p> The next several days were some of the most strained I have spent as a historian . Like a kid awaiting a mailaway prize he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race to the mailbox to see if the " Sacramento photographs , " as my wife dubbed them , had arrived . Finally they did . <p> My hands shook as I opened the manila envelope and looked at the first picture : a clear photograph of a barbette battery , parade ground , and engineers ' office building on Alcatraz Island-a photograph ordered destroyed in the summer of 1864 . <p> The other seven photographs were stunning views of the various batteries and buildings of the fort . Each corresponded neatly to one of the views described by Lieutenant Elliot in his letter to the chief of engineers , and each photo was erroneously labeled " Fort Point . " Apparently either the original donor or a librarian in Sacramento had misidentified the entire set , unaware that a vast artillery post had once existed on an island better known for such residents as Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly . <p> Ms. Noyes had included a note with the photographs . In the memo she informed me that the recorded donor was a woman descended from California 's pre-Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Union Army and posted to Alcatraz Island during the war . None of the donor 's descendants had any information about the photos . <p> At this point my search came to an abrupt end . What had begun with a note penciled on a yellow tag had led to the rediscovery of a long-lost piece of history , but identification of the photographs brought up tantalizing new questions . How did these particular photos escape seizure and destruction in accordance with Secretary of War Stanton 's orders ? How did Peter Burnett come to acquire them ? Did he somehow get possession of the only complete set of photographs , the ones intended for Captain Winder 's staff review ? <p> And finally , where are the missing forty-two views described by Lt. George Elliot ? Maybe they 're still out there mislabeled in some little-used archive . I hope someday another researcher will come across these remaining views and get the same thrill I experienced-the thrill of filling in a blank spot in history . <p> PHOTO : Twelve-pound field guns stand before the whitewashed engineers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view that started the author on his quest . <p> PHOTO : South Battery from the roof of South Caponier .
