Early Models // Thomas Stearns Eliot was born on 26 September 1888 in St Louis , Missouri , the son of a New England schoolteacher and a St Louis merchant . Thirty-eight years later he was baptised as an Anglican in an English village . Such facts tell little of a man for whom there was usually a gap between his outward and his private life , the constructed , highly articulate surface and the inward ferment . Wyndham Lewis painted Eliot 's face as if it were a mask , so that he might distinguish Eliot 's formal surface from his hooded introspective eyes , and the severe dark lines of his suit from the flesh of his shoulders beneath . Virginia Woolf wrote that his hazel eyes seemed oddly lively and youthful in a pale , sculptured , even heavy face . // Eliot 's admirers played up his mask , while detractors stripped it only to find the flaws : both overlooked a man of extremes whose deep flaws and high virtues were interfused .

He urged those close to him to keep silence , and sealed many letters until the next century . Meanwhile , he devised his own biography , enlarging in poem after poem on the character of a man who conceives of his life as a spiritual quest despite the anti-religious mood of his age and the distracting claims of women , friends , and alternative careers . He once spoke of the man who tries to explain to himself the sequence that culminates in faith ' , and in a letter , written in 1930 , mentioned his long-held intention to explore a mode of writing neglected in the twentieth century , the spiritual autobiography . // Eliot aimed to be a poet who , out of intense and personal experience , is able to express a general truth ' . In some sense his own works do retain all the particularity ' of personal experience , though to work back from the work to the life can only be done through imaginative transformations that intervene , the discarded fragments of The Waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , The Family Reunion . The challenge is to discern the bonds between life and work in a way that brings out the greatness of major works which are , after all , the most important facts in the poet 's life . To do this we must imagine a man with immortal longings , and reconstruct the strategy by which he attained immortality . The strategy was extraordinary , so willed in its acts of surrender , so directed in its doubts , so sure in its single-mindedness , that we see all the way the pure line of that trajectory  --  leaving broken lives in its wake . // Eliot was recognised in his lifetime as the moral spokesman of the twentieth century , but as that century now recedes from view the question is rising whether the huge power of his voice to engage our souls can sustain sympathy for a man who was stranger and more intolerant than his disarming masks would have us believe , a man who grew progressively harder to know during the inscrutable years of fame . Eliot 's guardians , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his intolerance for the masses , for women and Jews in particular , infects his greatness . The anti-Semitism is integral to the poetry , said a lawyer , Anthony Julius , who built up a formidable case against Eliot in 1996 , thirty years after the poet 's death . Biography , though , ca n't reduce a man to the adversarial categories  --  guilty or not guilty  --  of the courtroom . Courts construct set dramas that rarely elicit the complexity of motives in actual lives . Undoubtedly , an infection is there in Eliot  --  hate  --  and we ca n't explain it away ; and yet biographers , of all people , know it is na ? ve to expect the great to be good . Dickens was monstrous to his wife and children , while his works laud the social ideal of the family ; Tolstoy was a self-willed autocrat who parades an image of humble holy man ; Carlyle was another domestic tyrant , while Hardy estranged his wife and then wrote touching elegies after her death . Eliot 's superiority invites scrutiny . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thicket of things ill done and done to others ' harm ' . Shall we find that Eliot 's great poems answer ill-doing ? Is it conceivable that they are all the greater , in fact , for their admission of failure to match the perfect life to which Eliot aspired from the start ? // Eliot 's Notebook and other manuscript poems ( published thirty years after his death ) show that he began to measure his life by the divine goal as far back as his student days , in 1910 and 1911 , and that the turning-point came not when he was baptised in 1927 but in 1914 when he first interested himself in the motives , the ordeals , and the achievements of saints . In later years Eliot seemed to beg off personally in favour of a routine life of prayer and observance , but the early manuscripts suggest that for a time in his youth he dreamed of the saint 's ambitious task , of living by his own vision beyond the imaginative frontiers of his civilisation . // At the heart of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him in an English garden seven years after his conversion , a renewal of a sign he had as a student moving through the streets of Boston in June 1910 . It had cut through the urban clamour , cut through sense perception , cut through time itself with an intuition of timeless reality ' . Emily Dickinson called it // Eternity 's disclosure // To favorites  --  a few  --  // Of the Colossal substance // Of Immortality . // Eliot would not call it anything , unwilling to wrench it to fit words that fall short of the Word . But there is no question that he recognised whatever it was as momentous . He said simply there was nothing else to live for  --  there is nothing else beside ' . This absolute conviction explains his view of ordinary life as waste . In The Waste Land , the waste is a place , a city filled with hopeless inhabitants . Later , in Four Quartets , the waste is time , the waste sad time ' between signs . // Whether the waste was place or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grasp the sign . There followed , a bit automatically , Eliot 's disgust with the debasement of the human condition . This was confirmed by a wretched marriage and early struggles to make a living in what seemed , to a newcomer , a squalid and soulless London . His London , like the equally squalid Boston of his Preludes ' , is not really an objective scene but a correlate for the collapse of a private vision . If this is true , Eliot 's famous disgust is no common ? litism . It is a stranger , soul-sick state of his own . // Eliot is most outspoken in his poetry , guarded by his celebrated theory of impersonality which , he once admitted , was a bluff . As more is known of Eliot 's life , the clearer it becomes that the impersonal ' facade of his poetry  --  the multiple faces and voices  --  masks an often quite literal reworking of personal experience .

It may be called a biography , but in Eliot 's sense of the genre . Whenever he wrote about lives Eliot was not so much concerned with formal history and circumstance as with what he called unattended ' moments . The awful daring of a moment 's surrender , ' he wrote in The Waste Land . By this , and this only , we have existed . ' The external facts of Eliot 's life are here , but only to prop what was for him the definitive inward experience that shaped the work . By limiting biographic trivia , it is possible to trace the continuity of Eliot 's career and see poetry and life as complementary parts of one design , a consuming search for salvation . Throughout his life and throughout his work , Eliot was testing the sublime plot of spiritual biography , the plot laid down in Exodus : an exit from civilisation followed by a long trial in a waste place , followed by entry into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail would be to miss the point , and that is why , with Eliot , the form of full-scale biography is simply unsuited to an understanding of his life . // A poet , Yeats said , is never the bundle of accident and incoherence that sits down to breakfast ; he has been reborn as an idea , something intended , complete . ' It is hard to say exactly how or when the commanding idea is born but , in Eliot 's case , an obvious source suggests itself in the figures that surrounded his American youth . The shadowy exemplary figure that haunts Eliot 's poetry may be traced to his grandfather , whom Emerson called the Saint of the West ' , to his mother 's heroes of truth and virtue , to the hardy fishermen of Cape Ann , Massachusetts , who all shaped Eliot 's imagination . Towards the end of his life he came to see his poetry as more American than English : ... in its sources , in its emotional springs , it comes from America .

' His grandson was never whacked ' , in fact as the last of seven children he was spoilt ' , but he had no sense of importance in his own right . // Eliot 's parents were both forty-five when he was born , and seemed to him remote , like ancestors ' ; he felt closer to his only brother , Henry Ware Eliot , Jr , and to his sister Marian , nine and eleven years older .

Although he eventually found success as a manufacturer of bricks , he lived under the shadow of his own father , William Greenleaf Eliot , a financial genius of whom it was said that , had he not been called to the ministry , he might have owned nearly everything west of the Mississippi . There is little sign of imagination in Henry 's autobiography ; he presents himself as rather a plodder , proud of his industry and filial piety . He could be , in a studied way , playful and liked to draw faces on his children 's boiled eggs . He commended Tom as a modest and affectionate son , not as a promising one , and this left the boy rather mournful ' , since his grades , mostly C 's , gave no indication of latent gifts . // His mother , on the other hand , may have thought more of him than he granted , for she spoke to him as an equal .

Eliot spent his first sixteen years in a city distinguished at the turn of the century for the corruption of its businessmen , its inadequate sewers , and sulphurous fumes . Yet he could still say : I am very well satisfied with having been born in St. Louis .

I liked it very much . ' he recalled , the lights , the coloured statues and paper flowers , the lived-in atmosphere , and the fact that the pews had little gates that I could swing on . ' There is a photograph of Eliot , aged seven , with his dimpled nurse , his beret perched jauntily on his head and his face mischievous ; Annie 's lips are pursed , one hand on her hip . Years later , Eliot wrote a rhyme about some naughty Jim Jum Bears who got up to tricks to exasperate their Nurse ( Was ever a Nurse so put about ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days with Annie , to whom he said he was greatly attached ' . // Annie took him to Mrs Lockwood 's school , what was called in those days a dame school . When he was ten , in 1898 , he moved on to Smith Academy , a school founded by his grandfather ; his mother sent him in a sailor-suit , and the boys laughed . There was one other terrible ' humiliation as he described it : I sat between two little girls at a party . I was very hot . And one of the little girls leaned across ... to the other and whispered loudly : " Look at his ears ! " So one night I tied some rope round them when I went to bed , but my mother came and took it off and told me they would fold themselves back so I need n't worry . ' He avoided another children 's party : I walked round and round the streets until it was time to go home . ' // The Eliots lived in Locust Street , an unfashionable part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothels of Chestnut and Market Streets , at a time when pianists in back rooms were joining rags ' together as jolting tunes . At the turn of the century St Louis became the world 's ragtime capital , where Scott Joplin produced his ragtime opera in 1903 . An impresario called Turpin set up a National Ragtime Contest for the 1904 St Louis World 's Fair . This music was the first popular hit of the twentieth century , and there are Americans who claim that Eliot 's improvisation in The Waste Land ( 1922 ) is a kind of rag , joining snatches of tunes and voices in a single composition . Certainly , a rag of 1902 Under the Bamboo Tree ' by Johnson , Cole , and Johnson , was to enter Eliot 's Jazz Age play , Sweeney Agonistes ( 1926 ) . // Since most of the Eliots ' friends moved to quieter suburbs further west , and since Tom 's sisters and brother were a good bit older , he had few playmates and spent most of his time reading . One favourite was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to a dentist twice a week for two years : he found the collected works of Poe in the waiting-room , and managed to read them through . From 28 January to 19 February 1899 he brought out fourteen numbers of a magazine called The Fireside , boasting Fiction , Gossip , Theatre , Jokes and all interesting ' . At the same age he could identify some seventy kinds of birds on Cape Ann , Massachusetts , where the family spent the summer . He had a congenital double hernia and his mother , afraid it would rupture , forbade football and strenuous sports . When the Skipper ' gave him sailing lessons , Charlotte would go along , fortified by a guard of grown-up sisters , to ensure that he did not get too wet or too hot or too tired . He accepted his mother 's domination in good humour . // There was in Eliot 's mother a moral passion and a gift of eloquence . She had the intellectual ardour of able nineteenth-century women  --  like Dorothea Brooke in Middlemarch  --  a natural scholar whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out to be a poet , and when her youngest child showed talent , hoped that he might redeem her sense of failure . She wrote in a letter to Eliot at Harvard : // I hope in your literary work you will receive early the recognition I strove for and failed . I should so have loved a college course , but was obliged to teach before I was nineteen . I graduated with high rank , a young lady of unusual brilliancy as a scholar ' my old yellow testimonial says , but when I was set to teaching young children , my Trigonometry and Astronomy counted for nought , and I made a dead failure . // In 1862 , after her graduation from the State Normal School of Framingham , Massachusetts , she had moved from one teaching post to another  --  Pennsylvania , Milwaukee , Antioch College in Ohio , and then back to Framingham . It was when she moved yet again to teach at the St Louis Normal School that she met a handsome clerk who shipped goods on the Mississippi . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She then devoted her energies to her growing family and local reforms , particularly a separate house of detention for juveniles . When her husband went bankrupt in the 1870s , she supported the family for a year , teaching at an adjoining girls ' school , the Mary Institute . Her room displayed no sign of conventional femininity except for a pincushion on the dresser . There was a comfortable armchair next to a sunny window even though it blocked a chest of drawers . The bed faced a mantelpiece draped with a velvet cloth on which rested a painting of the Madonna and child . On her wall there hung an engraving of Theodosius and St Ambrose , illustrating the triumph of holy over temporal power . // After her death , when Henry Ware Eliot , Jr , placed Charlotte 's poems in Harvard 's Eliot Collection , he wrote to the librarian : Perhaps a hundred years from now the connection with T. S. Eliot will not seem so remote . Of all the family , my brother most resembled my mother in features and ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been from that side that T. S. Eliot got his tastes . ' Apart from Charlotte herself , there were no writers on the Stearns side , but there was that moral fervour . The statue called The Puritan ' in Springfield , Massachusetts , shows a Stearns ancestor striding forward with a huge Bible grasped under one arm and , in the other , a pilgrim 's staff . A reserved uncle , the Revd Oliver Stearns , used to startle his students at Harvard Divinity School with sudden floods of eloquence . Whatever he saw to be true or right , that would he say and do , though the heavens fell ' . // It is telling to read Charlotte Eliot 's poetry in the context of her son 's work . She writes of the vision of the seer ' and the prophet 's warning cry ' . Her poems recount turning-points in the lives of the chosen : the Apostles and The Unnamed Saints ' , St Barnabas and St Theodosius . Her heroes are truth-inebriated ' , God-intoxicated ' individualists modelled on nineteenth-century New Englanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her St Francis trust the private vision . Her image of the thinker who , from unfathomed depths , seizes on the sublime truth is almost identical with the dominant figure in her son 's vigil poems of 1911 and 1912. // Charlotte Eliot 's strength is essentially that of a preacher . All the force of her poetry lies in passionate argument and dramatic illustration . She speaks particularly to those who by gift of genius ' are set apart ; her message is to endure with faith periods of religious despair : // Ye who despair // Of man 's redemption , know , the light is there , // Though hidden and obscured , again to shine ... // ( Saved ! ' ) // Her gift is didactic ; she lacks the inventiveness and imaginative freshness of the great poet . Her son , using the same traditional images , rescued them from triteness  --  the beatific light , the fires of lust and purgation , the pilgrimage across the desert waste ' , and the seasonal metaphor for spiritual drought that pervades his mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boughs in her garden go stiff and dry , no flower blooms , while a new power awaits its birth . April is the cruellest month , ' her son was to write , breeding lilacs out of the dead land ' . Mother and son used the same traditional images to signal grace . In The Master 's Welcome ' she hears children 's voices . Bells signal recovery of faith after a period of doubt . Water  --  the celestial fountain ' and the healing flood '  --  promises relief after long ordeals. // Charlotte Eliot mapped out states of being between loss and recovery of grace , a map her son redrew in his poetry in twentieth-century terms . The main difference was his mother 's optimism . She felt an assurance of grace her son could not share . His faint-hearted character , J. Alfred Prufrock , feels obliged to frame an overwhelming ' question but shirks it . In the context of his lack of nerve , it is curious to note the many questions Charlotte Eliot posed in her poetry : How does one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know we must die ? And is this all , this life so incomplete ? ' What shall I do to be saved ? ' Eliot had a model of the perfect life before he left his mother 's side ; the long-term issue was whether he could make it his own . // He was later to lead a double life : publicly at the centre of a sycophantic buzz ; privately there was the incommunicable life of a solitary that was all the stranger because it was conducted in the stir of the city , in the glare of fame . There was an inward silence and , at the same time , a speaker on platforms across Europe and America . Eliot 's face acquired a sort of exposed reticence from the habit of looking down from a lectern into rows upon rows of eyes . His skin had a look of being drawn tightly across his face . His features , though sharp , were delicate , especially the softly indented mouth . It was his nature to have scruple within scruple and to regulate his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Lot in Sodom or Daniel in Babylon who , Eliot said , kept silence because they could do no good . // He often spoke of the unspoken ' . In a solitude guarded by public masks he lived a hidden life . It would be unreachable if he had not been a poet with a need to explore and define that life . His poetry distils a predetermined drama from the dross so that what emerges is the coherent form of spiritual autobiography , direct , honest , and more penetrating than any outsider could dare to determine  --  a life so closely allied to creative works as to be a reciprocal invention . This biography follows his own formulation , testing it against the facts of his actual existence . // * * * // In a talk , The Influence of Landscape upon the Poet ' , Eliot called himself a New England poet because he had been so deeply affected when he came east as a child . He was always happy near the sea and would remember with joy his boyhood summers at Gloucester , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family stayed at the Hawthorne Inn ; then , in 1896 , his father built a large , solid house at Eastern Point , beyond the town , on land bought in 1890 , an uncultivated rough coast , surrounded by wild bush and slabs of rock going down to the sea 's edge . The upper windows looked out on the granite shore , the white sails on the sea and , looking the other way , the harbour . Eliot remembered Gloucester harbour as one of the most beautiful on the New England coast . A photograph by his brother , Henry , shows it at the turn of the century , the tall masts of what was then an all-sail fishing fleet dominating the village in the background with its clapboard houses and sloping roofs . From the beginning , fishing was the main occupation in Gloucester . When a divine came among the first settlers in the seventeenth century and said : Remember , brethren , that you journeyed here to save your souls , ' one of the brethren added , And to ketch fish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Main Street and Duncan Street told yarns of storms and shipwrecks on the half-hidden rocks offshore from Cape Ann . Working in hard winter gales , the deep-sea fisherman put out from the schooner in a tiny dory which often capsized or went astray in fog or snow . And when a man lived through such an experience , he told the kind of yarn Eliot listened to as a boy , of risk and tenacity beyond belief . // Glory in the fisherman 's casual acts of heroism and hardy self-reliance is reflected in Eliot 's schoolboy compositions and sustained through his writings . In A Tale of a Whale ' , published in the Smith Academy Record in April 1905 , and in The Man Who Was King ' , published the following June , Eliot made proud use of sailing jargon . Later , in Marina ( 1930 ) , the dross of civilisation is blown away by the sea wind , and an awakening to redemptive love , its mystery and promise , is aligned with the perilous crossing of the Atlantic and slow approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its woods and grey rocks . Eliot imagined forebears in the mould of the Cape Ann sea captains he admired . In an article called Gentlemen and Seamen ' ( 1909 ) he extols as plebeian aristocrats ' men like the old Eliots  --  small-town patriarchs , seamen , small printers , and tradesmen , who established themselves in villages along the New England coast . His great-grandfather William Greenleaf Eliot , Sr , had been a New Bedford ship-owner , and acquired a dinner service of Chinese willow-ware ' porcelain which survives in the family . Eliot calls up old sombre faces , old compressed lips , old Eliot natures difficult and unyielding as a consequence of religious principle and endless struggle with the narrow resources of New England . // As a child Eliot explored the Cape Ann beaches for what the sea tossed up  --  starfish , a whale bone , a broken oar , a horseshoe crab . The pools offered , for his curiosity , the more delicate algae and the sea anemone ' . He collected , dried , and classified algae . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw the sea anemone for the first time , an experience , he remembered , not so simple , for an exceptional child , as it looks ' . // Eliot was to return again and again to the Cape Ann shore and sea for scenes of crisis and revelation in his poetry . To the Cape Ann summers of his youth he owed his model , drawn from the Gloucester fisherman , of a sailor faring forward ' on the thin edge of mortality . His imagination fastened , too , on the still pool and the light-filled water that recurred in his poetry as a tantalising memory of unspeakable bliss . // * * * // When Eliot was sixteen his mother published a biography of her father-in-law , William Greenleaf Eliot , and dedicated it to her children Lest They Forget ' . I was brought up to be very much aware of him , ' Eliot said . The standard of conduct was that which my grandfather had set : our moral judgements , our decisions between duty and self-indulgence , were taken as if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Law , any deviation from which would be sinful ... ' // William had a narrow frail body and large , calm , benign eyes . His son , Henry , recalled those magnificent eyes in his autobiography , and said that they seemed to read one 's innermost thoughts . William 's expression was sensitive and serene , the face of a man who looks on suffering from a citadel of moral assurance . He was not stern , but it would have been unthinkable , said his son , to argue with him or to attempt undue familiarity . How can one be familiar with the Day of Judgement ? ' said James Freeman Clark , a classmate at Divinity School . One feels rebuked in his presence .... Yet he is playful , fond of fun , and there is a sweet smile appearing on the corner of his mouth . But there is no abandon .

He learnt , for instance , that it was self-indulgent to buy candy , and it was not until he was forced to stop smoking in his sixties that he could bring himself to eat it as a substitute . This kind of upbringing was , of course , not peculiar to the Eliot home . Henry Adams , also constrained by the virtue of New England ancestors , recalled that he would eat only the less perfect peaches in his grandfather 's garden . // Eliot 's grandfather had died in 1887 , the year before his birth , but a vice-regent in the shape of his grandmother lived on next door all through his youth . Abigail Adams Eliot ( 1817-1908 ) , who had spent her childhood in Washington , could recall her great-uncle , the second President , for whose wife she was named , and she knew his son , John Quincy Adams , the sixth President , grandfather of the writer Henry Adams ( 1838-1918 ) with whom Eliot felt much in common . // As Eliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grandfather 's laws , the subordination of selfish interests to the good of Community and Church .

A brilliant fund-raiser , he helped found both the Academy of Science in St. Louis and Washington University , where he served as unpaid professor of metaphysics . He was an early advocate of women 's suffrage and of prohibition . During the terrible typhoid epidemic of the 1840s he visited sickbeds indefatigably , and during the Civil War organised the Western Sanitary Commission in Missouri which looked after the medical services of the Northern army and its fleet on the Mississippi . For three decades , he opposed slavery in his border state , appalled by whippings , mob violence , and the vile traffic ' of chained gangs led through the streets to the steamboats going South ; he was known as St Louis ' only open abolitionist ' .

' The gambling and drinking habits of the French Catholics and American pioneers from Kentucky and Virginia ( who settled St Louis ) had called , said Eliot , for his grandfather 's strong missionary hand .

He was drawn into the frenzy of the Salem witch trials , where he condemned innocents to death , along with the notorious hanging ' Judge Blood , a forebear on the Stearns side ( Eliot 's grandmother Charlotte Blood was a descendant ) .

There was a political tie between William 's brother , Thomas Dawes Eliot , and Edward Dickinson ( father of Emily Dickinson ) who shared rooms in Washington as representatives to Congress in the 1850s , where they set up meetings that led to the formation of the anti-slavery Republican Party .

By the next century the Eliots were flourishing as city people , conspicuous in the affairs of Boston . The first to distinguish himself was the Revd Andrew Eliot ( 1718-78 ) . Chubby-faced , with neat features and a double chin , he seldom gave controversial sermons from his pulpit in the New North Church . His Calvinism was moderate in temper but he practised it most earnestly . When Boston was blockaded during the Revolution , he was the only Congregational minister , apart from Samuel Mather , to open his church every Lord 's Day .

Two centuries later , in 1765 , the Revd Andrew Eliot preached a censorious election-day sermon before the colonial governor of Massachusetts . Both Eliots escaped charges of treason because their tones were sober . They felt strongly about morals , conduct , and the public good , but they did not resort to flaming rhetoric . // There was much in the model Eliot man to admire . Throughout his life , T. S.

For they demand that a man be not a member of a family or a caste or of a party or of a coterie , but simply and solely himself . ' Eliot puzzled and alarmed his parents by staying in London in 1915 instead of finishing his doctorate at Harvard , and by spending years writing poetry that was published only sporadically and in little-known magazines . His father died in 1919 under the impression that his youngest child had made a mess of his life . Yet although Eliot resisted the family pattern he also followed it , first as a poor clerk like his father in the early Mississippi days , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful man of business . To the end of his life he faithfully performed the kind of responsible daily labour that had been , for generations , the self-affirming activity of the Eliot family . // * * * // Bred in a family which belongs at the very heart of Boston Unitarianism , Eliot 's fervent nature found no nourishment there , and by the time he enrolled at Harvard he had become indifferent to the Church . The religion taught by William Greenleaf Eliot was strict rather than spiritual . He was not concerned with perfection , or doctrine , or theology , but with a code that would better the human lot . With Unitarian scorn for evangelical enthusiasm , he said that educated , practical people reject sudden miraculous conversion , wrought by divine power , independently of the human will ... by which the sinner of yesterday is the saint of today . ' True salvation comes from human effort . It is at once arrogant and dangerous to claim direct and extraordinary guidance . It is virtually to claim inspiration , and that which begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his children and grandchildren a religion which retained Puritan uprightness , social conscience , and self-restraint , but which had been transformed by the Enlightenment . T. S. Eliot was taught to be dutiful , benevolent , and cheerful . He was always acutely sensitive to the power of evil , but was taught a practical common-sense code of conduct . He once mentioned that his parents did not talk of good and evil but of what was done ' and not done ' . In abandoning Unitarianism , Eliot rebelled against those tepid , unemotional distinctions . So far as we are human , ' he wrote , what we do must be either evil or good . ' Like Jonathan Edwards , who had rebelled in the first half of the eighteenth century against religion tamed as a respectable code and re-evoked the fervent religion of the previous century , so Eliot in the first half of the twentieth century sought an older , stricter discipline , unsoftened by nineteenth-century liberalism . Edwards and Eliot each seemed , to his own time , an isolated reactionary . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great Awakening , in opposition to the Puritan conviction of man 's innate sinfulness . The Unitarians were confident of man 's innate nobility ( Eliot 's grandfather was a prot ? g ? of the leading Unitarian of the early nineteenth century , William Ellery Channing , who spoke of man 's likeness to God ' ) . They rejected the Puritans ' doctrine of damnation , their tests of orthodoxy and heresy , and undemocratic distinctions between church members . Their God was benevolent not wrathful . The year before Eliot was born , his mother praised a benign , rational universe in her poem , Force and God ' : // While worlds harmonious move in breathless awe // We whisper God is here , and God is Law . ' // In view of the sincere piety of Eliot 's mother and grandfather and his father 's lifelong support of the Unitarian Church , it may seem odd that he should have come to think of himself as one brought up outside the Christian Fold ' . He had in mind the Unitarians ' denial of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a belief in the Incarnation . In 1931 Eliot wrote to the critic Middleton Murry that the perfection of a Lord who was merely human did not seem to him perfection at all . His antagonism to England 's greatest religious poet may be traced to his grandfather 's view of Milton as a Unitarian . Similarly , Eliot 's wish to exclude free thinking Jews has to do with the easy association of such Jews and Unitarians in his youth . The Jewish religion is unfortunately not a very portable one , ' Eliot said in 1940 , and shorn of its traditional practices , observances and Messianism , it tends to become a mild and colourless form of Unitarianism . ' So , Eliot disliked the intellectual and puritanical rationalism ' of his early environment . In his revival of ideas of depravity and damnation , and in his craving for orthodoxy , he opposed his Unitarian background . Probably the most important difference was his sense of man 's unlikeness , his distance from an unknowable deity . // Eliot said that to understand a modern writer it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decayed Protestantism which surrounded his childhood . Already in the 1830s Emerson resigned his pulpit in protest against corpse-cold Unitarianism ' . The Transcendentalists of the 1840s liberated themselves from formal Christianity and trusted , like Emerson , in the private light , but the next generation found themselves , as one historian puts it , in a chilling void ... The heir of Emerson was Henry Adams who turned away from the barren chaos of American life to the certitudes of Dante and St Thomas ; and after Henry Adams came Eliot who not only admired the lost traditions of Catholicism from a distance , but made a heroic attempt to recapture them . ' // For sensitive Unitarian children growing up in America in the nineteenth century , the bland surface presented by their religion must have seemed to resist too much of life . Eliot himself made only passing critical comments , but Henry Adams 's analysis of the insufficiencies of Unitarianism suggests what Eliot reacted against : // Nothing quieted doubt so completely as the mental calm of the Unitarian clergy ... They proclaimed as their merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means of leading a virtuous , useful , unselfish life , which they held to be sufficient for salvation . For them , difficulties might be ignored ; doubts were a waste of thought ... Boston had solved the universe ... The religious instinct had vanished , and could not be revived , although one made in later life many efforts to recover it ... That the most intelligent society , led by the most intelligent clergy , in the most moral conditions he ever knew , should have ... quite ceased making itself anxious about past and future ... seemed to him the most curious social phenomenon he had to account for in a long life . // The Unitarian code , with its optimistic notion of progress ( onward and upward forever ' , Eliot said as a student ) , glossed over unpleasant changes in American life , particularly after the Civil War . Walt Whitman , commenting on a widespread hollowness at heart ' , wrote : The great cities reek with respectable as much as non-respectable robbery and scoundrelism ... A sort of dry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grotesques , malformations , phantoms ... ' with manners probably the meanest to be seen in the world ' . The authority of the class to which Adams and Eliot belonged , genteel responsible descendants of the Puritans , was superseded by the business power of the Gilded Age . In St Louis the moral law of William Greenleaf Eliot was ousted by the motive of profit , and in 1902 the city 's corruption was scandalously exposed . Eliot was sensitive to the monotony that resulted from immense industrial expansion at the end of the nineteenth century and to the loss of native ( New England ) culture to a new America in which , as he put it , Theodore Roosevelt was a patron of the arts . The muscular Virginian was the popular hero during Eliot 's adolescence , not Lambert Strether . Eliot belonged to an older America , before 1828 he said , when the country seemed like a family extension ' . What that date meant to Eliot must be a guess . It was soon after that Eliot 's grandfather left Boston for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lite of the eastern seaboard lost their power in the bitter election of 1828 , when John Quincy Adams fell before the rude , uncultivated Andrew Jackson . Was Eliot still resisting the impact of Jacksonian democracy  --  more Western , more individualistic  --  a hundred years on ? Or was it some more subtle change : the fading of the last traces of Calvinist piety before the cheery optimism of a new age of self-reliance ? For Emerson , the very advocate of self-reliance , that old demanding piety remained a lingering force through his memory of his Calvinist aunt , Mary Moody Emerson : What a debt is ours to that old religion which , in the childhood of most of us , still dwelt like a Sabbath morning in the country of New England , teaching privation , self-denial and sorrow ' . // During Eliot 's youth his mother guarded him from the jarring aspects of the new America . It is necessary to look rather to the more trying years that followed in Boston to explain why Eliot came to feel oppressed by the American scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
