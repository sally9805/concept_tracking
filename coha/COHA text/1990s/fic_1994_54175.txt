" YOU KNOW HOW Daddy feels about shopping , do n't you ? " Mrs. Goodman says . <p> She fans her red-nailed fingers above the wheel , awaiting her daughter 's reply . They 're stopped at a traffic light , not far from the mall entrance . <p> Edie knows her next line , of course ; it 's just a matter of her delivery . She stares out her window and for some reason presses her nose to the glass , like a child . <p> She says , not hearing herself , " No , how does Daddy feel ? " <p> Mrs. Goodman says rapidly , " He feels that shopping is our privilege and our right . Nay , our solemn duty . " <p> Edie knows that her mother is n't smiling . It 's part of Mrs. Goodman 's humorous persona  --  the Marsha Goodman whom her bridge-party acquaintances consider " outrageous , " " hysterical , " etcetera  --  that she almost never smiles . <p> It 's a technique , of sorts . <p> " Is that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Her father : the last person on earth she cares to think about . <p> Thank God , there 's a parking place right in front of Saks . Mrs. Goodman complains mightily if she has to park more than a few steps from the stores . Lately Edie has noticed that Phipps Plaza  --  always Atlanta 's ritziest mall , and now renovated and expanded  --  has begun attracting larger and larger crowds . The mall has Lord &; Taylor , Tiffany 's , Gucci , and Mrs. Goodman 's favorite , the deliciously expensive Saks with its salmon-carpeted curving staircase and unctuous salesclerks ; and there are assorted smaller stores like Skippy Musket ( antique jewelry ) and La Bottega ( imported handbags ) , which are equally expensive . Mrs. Goodman approves of all the stores in Phipps Plaza and is a familiar sight in here : busy , prepossessing , overdressed , a heavily made-up blond Jewish lady with one eyebrow arched , her blank-looking daughter in tow . But most people ca n't afford this kind of shopping , after all . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they go to Lenox Square , the much larger mall just across Peachtree Road . " You kno , " Edie had said , in a mock-petulant voice , " where the people are  --  the normal people ? " But Mrs. Goodman had pretended to be shocked , her red-glossed lips forming a horrified O. <p> " Are you my daughter , truly ? " she 'd asked . " You know that Daddy prefers the better stores . You know that Daddy is very particular about our shopping . " <p> Now mother and daughter maneuver themselves out of Mrs. Goodman 's year-old burgundy Seville , a challenging task because both are rather plump inside their bulky fur  --  trimmed coats . The Cadillac 's velvet upholstery is so luxuriously thick that it seems to retard their progress , urging them to stay seated , stay inside this beautiful car forever .... So Edie 's sardonic thoughts run , in any case , as she opens the heavy car door , with a grunt of resigned effort , then stands and pushes it shut . She glares over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ash-blond wig ( only one of her several dozen wigs ) , her thick makeup that today includes bold black eyeliner and violet shadow , and her famous wetlooking cherry-red lipstick . As she often does , Edie imagines that her mother is another woman , a stranger . Watching Mrs. Goodman gather her dark-red coat around her , fluffing the ranch-mink collar along her jaw , Edie thinks yes , oh yes definitely : a stranger . <p> At such moments Edie drifts gently into lurid fantasies of escape and betrayal . Shall she simply turn and walk in the opposite direction from Mrs. Goodman , heading for Peachtree Road and Lenox Square instead of Saks , while her mother gapes after her ? Or , inside Mrs. Goodman 's favorite store , should Edie pick a fight over nothing , over a necklace or a pair of gloves , screaming shrill obscenities in front of the clerks and well-dressed customers while Mrs. Goodman stares in disbelief ? Or , more covertly , will Edie scrutinize the other middle-aged women in the store as though shopping for a replacement mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she simply walk off with her , take hold of the woman 's arm , chatter in her ear of inconsequential things ? <p> Yes , Edie supposes dreamily that she might do any of these things , or all of them ! - but instead she follows her mother into the mall . <p> It 's eleven o'clock , a weekday in early January : out of the thin frothy sunlight , and into the open luxurious spaces of Phipps Plaza . Mrs. Goodman heads for the escalator , talking and gesturing , while Edie tries vainly to keep up . Inevitably , she falls a few paces behind , her eyes downcast , and the fantasies intrude again : for what if she stopped , abruptly , and allowed her mother to continue up the moving stairs , chattering busily to herself ? What if she ducked into a store and strode purposefully toward one of the outside exits ? What then , what then ? But , getting off the escalator , Mrs. Goodman pauses , waiting until Edie trudges up to her mother 's side . <p> Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe we should start off with .. . <p> " Maybe we should start off with a little drinkie , " Mrs. Goodman says , eyeing the entrance to the Peasant Uptown , her favorite restaurant . " After all , it 's almost lunchtime , " she adds , as if convincing herself . <p> Edie thinks , Then we 'll be fortified , wo n't we . . . <p> " Then we 'll be fortified , wo n't we , for a bit of shopping . And then we can get ourselves a bite of lunch . " <p> Edie stays silent , so Mrs. Goodman stares at her . <p> " Right , honey ? " she says . <p> " By all means , let 's fortify ourselves , " Edie mutters , following her mother inside . An effusive , smiling hostess leads them to their table and , not needing to ask , a deft young waiter quickly brings a double martini with two olives for Mrs. Goodman and a diet cola for Edie . <p> " Good morning , ladies , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost . . <p> " But it 's almost afternoon , so we 're allowed , " Mrs. Goodman says primly , and now it 's Edie 's turn to stare . <p> " Honey , is something wrong ? " her mother asks , when the waiter is gone . " You look so  --  so  --  " She gives a little shudder . <p> Edie ponders the ultimate sacrilege , then decides against it , then thinks why not , just why the hell not ? <p> She settles her level , hard look upon Mrs. Goodman 's eyes ( which are really quite tiny and frightened-looking inside all the mess of paint and goop ) , and says in her best droll manner : " Mother , I 've been meaning to ask you something . What is the point  --  could you tell me , please  --  of all this shopping ? " <p> Of course , her mother 's beak is already inserted into the martini , her small eyes darting busily around the restaurant . Of course , her mother has n't heard . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breath . And she takes up her own glass . She drinks . <p> My goodness , there are n't many . . . <p> " My goodness , there are n't many people out this morning , " her mother says , in her fake-disappointed voice . <p> " Oh , but we are , " Edie replies . <p> During that busy , hectic time between Thanksgiving and Christmas , Dr. Goodman finally left them . <p> Or , as Mrs. Goodman prefers to say , airily , he " decamped , " leaving them the big house on Haversham Road and all the furnishings  --  including some priceless antiques and paintings inherited from his parents-and both Cadillacs and the bulk , by far , of his stock and bond holdings . And his bank accounts . And those big chunks of Buckhead real estate he 'd been quietly acquiring through the years . Two sets of lawyers had been in the house during those last weeks  --  Edie would pause at the base of the stairway , listening to their dark murmurous voices from the library-den where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upshot had been that Mrs. Goodman could have everything , or almost everything . Dr. Goodman kept only the small stone-and-redwood house up at Lake Lanier , and his beloved little Porsche Carrera , and perhaps half a million in cash and securities : he would n't need any more , he told Mrs. Goodman , for the kind of modest retirement he wanted . As for the rest  --  worth four million ? six million ? - Mrs . Goodman could do her worst , she could fling wads of bills from the top of the IBM building , she could slurp Dom Perignon from morning to night , she could shop till her plump little legs wore down to nubs . <p> Or rather , Edie imagined that she might have said such things , in her father 's position . <p> In truth , she could not put herself in her father 's position , for she no longer knew him , really . Dr. Goodman no longer came home early from the office to take Edie on meandering strolls around the neighborhood , as he 'd done when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied them : she had her headaches , she was " indisposed . " Mrs. Goodman hated any kind of exercise unrelated to shopping . ) No longer did he take his " little girl " on impulsive Saturday trips to Six Flags , or to the lake house where they fished from the motorboat or tramped gaily through the woods , Dr. Goodman looking funny and boisterous in his short pants and sneakers , his portly frame moving nimbly over tree roots and puddles , his plump womanish legs gleaming mushroom-white in the dank gloom of the woods .... Yes , Edie had adored her father . People said they looked alike , which at that time Edie had n't yet heard as a veiled rebuke or a sorrowful prediction . She and her father were short , squat , dark-complected , and both moved along with a " duck 's waddle , " as Mrs. Goodman laughingly said . ( Rather heavy herself , Mrs. Goodman nonetheless walked with the bold and purposeful strides of a huntress . Following along , waddling along , Edie did her best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " walking " at all . ) Edie and her father had been inseparable back then . Whenever Edie was taunted at school about her weight , or called " frog legs " by the prettier girls , she 'd simply close her eyes and think of Daddy who called her his " little princess , " his " little ballerina , " and even ( somehow , this was Edie 's favorite nickname ) his " little whatchamacallit . " <p> But that had changed . By the time Edie was twelve or thirteen , her father spent much less time at home . Sometimes , late at night , they 'd bump into each other in the upstairs hall , and he 'd say " Oops , sorry " in the oddly formal voice one uses with a stranger , an adult stranger , or else he 'd say nothing at all , just cup her face for a moment in his hands , as if she were one of his plastic-surgery patients and he were asking himself if there was hope , if there was anything he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss her forehead before shuffling down the hall to his room  --  by now , he slept in the spare room alone , while Mrs. Goodman stayed in the master suite with a black sleeping mask over her eyes  --  and Edie would be left to return to her own room , where she had the habit of standing before a full-length mirror ( stolid , dour-faced , her eyes dark and sad and impenetrable ) for long silent minutes before climbing into bed . That time , a Friday night about six months ago , she 'd felt her father 's kiss still moist and clammy on her forehead , but she thought : Nope , not a little princess , still a frog . She thought : And tomorrow , I 'll get dragged to the mall by Mother , to shop for some frogclothes . She was tempted to give herself a little frog-croak in the mirror , but these days she 'd begun losing even her humor , no longer quite seeing the point . <p> So she did n't respond to her mother 's occasional late-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look twice when , some mornings , Mrs. Goodman came down to breakfast without makeup , her face doughy-pale and unformed , and sometimes even without a wig , her colorless hair floating in thin dry wisps about her head . But Edie noticed that the woman 's eyes were pink , like a rabbit 's eyes , and she thought : <p> The rabbit and the frog , having breakfast together . She thought : I hope she croaks , too , ha ha . But she said nothing . <p> So the months passed and the divorce happened and Mrs. Goodman has seemingly become obsessed with spending every penny of her exhusband 's money before she finally does croak , but Edie still follows along numbly  --  waddling , friendless , doomed  --  knowing she still looks like a smaller version of her father , even with her chunky body enwrapped in this bulky wool coat with its fur collar . But unlike him , she is n't able to cut herself off , get free , simply turn and waddle away . Unlike him , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's two martinis , then an hour for their lunch  --  lobster crepes plus a third martini for Mrs. Goodman , Caesar salad and a club soda for Edie  --  so it 's past one o'clock before their shopping really begins . Today , Edie has been thinking , as her mother chattered endlessly over her lunch about the divorce of one of her bridge partners ( " poor Brenda , " Mrs. Goodman said , " everyone saw it coming but her " ) , today there is one good thing : Mrs. Goodman is shopping for herself instead of for Edie . One of her mother 's New Year 's resolutions , repeated endlessly to Edie around the house , is her plan to become more sociable : to accept invitations when they come her way , whether invitations of " the male or female persuasion . " Yesterday she received one of the male persuasion  --  oddly , he is one of Dr. Goodman 's divorce lawyers , a man likewise divorced , portly , good-natured  --  so it 's important that Mrs. Goodman find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the symphony  --  Mrs. Goodman ca n't remember which , she was so flustered and pleased by the offer . " Your father never took me anywhere , " Mrs. Goodman told Edie , " so I 've got to find something new  --  maybe a lovely white winter wool ? Or should I get a new black frock , something sleek and slimming , ' as they say ? What do you think , Edie ? " But of course she did n't wait for a reply . Of course she would n't have appreciated the reply , had her daughter dared to utter it . <p> So today Edie 's merely a sidekick , a tagalong . She has no particular function , except as the receiver of her mother 's queries , complaints , exclamations . First they go to Lord &; Taylor , since it 's closest to the restaurant , but this is just a warm-up , Edie knows . Recently Mrs. Goodman informed her that she does n't " take Lord &; Taylor seriously , not anymore , " since she no longer considers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright-gold silk jacket , with shoulder pads , and a matching skirt ; then a burgundy velvet dress that shows Mrs. Goodman 's pot belly so clearly that she shrieks the instant she steps before the triple mirrors ; then a blue-and-black sequined jacket with black chiffon harem pants , an outfit that makes her look even shorter and dumpier than she is . " Oh well , " she sighs , standing before the mirrors in this last outfit  --  she appears almost to be kneeling , Edie thinks cruelly  --  " I 'm afraid that Lord &; Taylor has failed us , once again . " <p> The saleswoman who has been helping them comes up with two more outfits draped over her arm , asking would Mrs. Goodman care to try these , but Edie 's mother says brusquely , " No , I certainly would not . " And , winking at Edie , hurries back behind the curtains . <p> Edie has n't winked back , but now the saleswoman stands gaping at her , as if awaiting an explanation . Edie feels the words forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's just your garden-variety psychotic , but of course Edie does n't say these words . Or any words . She gives her best blank look until the woman , smiling feebly , shrugs and gives up and goes away . <p> At last , they 're headed toward Saks , where her mother is sure to buy something : where her mother has never not bought something . Ah , the lovely muted colors and delicious aromas of Saks !  --  even Edie likes coming here , knowing that nothing really bad can happen , that even the most profound embarrassments are here diffused by the lilting background music and the perfumed , gently circulating air and by the smiles of the saleswomen , who are so impeccably groomed and dressed that at first glance Edie will often mistake one of them for a mannequin .... Now , as Mrs. Goodman veers toward an alcove marked " After 5 , " already talking to the woman who has hurried forth to greet her , Edie dawdles nearby , at the glove counter . She picks up some soft brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the price tag reads $75  --  then drops them and picks up another pair , a delicious vanilla suede so incredibly soft and supple that suddenly she is moved to gather up several pairs and thrust her face into them , inhaling with her eyes closed , and for a moment she 's transported somewhere else altogether .... Then a woman behind the counter approaches : " Help you , dear . . . ? " She is smiling indulgently , knowing well the power of those exquisite gloves , but quickly Edie straightens , drops all but one pair , and asks : " How much are these ? " The price tag is plainly visible , attached to a small plastic security device that would trigger an alarm if Edie tried to shoplift the gloves ; but nonetheless the woman bends over the tag , frowning . " Let 's see , those are $125 . And so lovely , are n't they ? Shall I check for a pair in your size ? " <p> Edie hears herself say : " Yes , please . Size seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counter , Edie takes them reverently , works her plump fingers into them one by one . <p> " May I take them over there ? Show them to my mother ? " Edie says , not quite meeting the woman 's eyes . <p> " Of course , of course ! " the woman says , with a pleased glance in the direction of Mrs. Goodman . " I 'm sure she 'll want you to have them . " <p> " Yes , um  --  thank you , " Edie says , contorting her mouth into a feeble approximation of the woman 's relentless smile , and then she backs away , in that dreamy , slow-motion way of experienced shoppers , her eye still grazing the glass shelves heaped with gloves . Then she steps across the aisle and joins her mother . <p> " Well , what do you think ? " Mrs. Goodman says at once , holding up a black beaded cocktail dress with a deep-cut bodice and flaring skirt . When Edie stares at the dress but does n't answer  --  she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the bodice  --  the saleswoman says quickly , " That one 's so versatile  --  a perfect foil for your lovely skin , or a special piece of jewelry . Would you like to try it on . . . ? " <p> " Yeah , maybe , " Mrs. Goodman mutters , still plowing through the rack . She shoves each dress into view with an expert flick of her hand , stares for several seconds , goes to the next one . She pauses at a yellow silk with puffed sleeves , then slowly lifts it from the rack . <p> " That one 's lovely , too , " the saleswoman says . " With your hair color , especially , it would be simply  --  " <p> " Edie , what do you think ? " Mrs. Goodman says . Her daughter stands there looking doleful , the suede gloves drooping from her clenched fist . With her other hand , she touches the shoulder of the dress-a meaningless gesture . " It 's nice , I guess , " she says neutrally . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " <p> " Okay , I 'll try these , " Mrs. Goodman tells the woman . <p> While her mother is changing , Edie sits in the waiting area in a big overstuffed chair and endures the saleswoman 's small talk . Helplessly Edie remembers one Christmas day , many years ago , when Mrs. Goodman gave her husband a beautiful fawn-colored suede jacket . Though they were Jewish , Dr. Goodman threw a large " open house " every Christmas during Edie 's early childhood , declaring that the spirit of Christmas was available to everyone  --  and it was the spirit that counted , after all , not anyone 's particular religious beliefs . Edie recalls that the year he got the jacket  --  she must have been five or six  --  her father wore it proudly around the house during the party . That 's why she remembered the smell , why she picked up those gloves , for she could still feel the thrilling luxury of riding in her father 's arms , borne from room to room as he greeted their guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the club , aunts and cousins and other family members whom they saw only once a year  --  at this huge catered party . Edie was still young enough , that year , that she could ignore the guests , look away shyly when they proclaimed ( speaking to her father , not to her ) how " cute " she was , though even at that age when all children are cute Edie was , as she now knows , a borderline case : her mouth overlarge , her face already lumpish , sallow , the same mushroom-white as her legs . But she did n't know , then . She did n't care , then . She felt so protected and privileged in her father 's arms !  --  carried like a princess through the rooms . And did n't he sometimes say , laughing , that " his home was his castle " ? He knew it was a cliche , but he did n't care  --  like most cliches it was so true . And who had invented the majority of cliches , after all ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often , became something of a cliche for Dr. Goodman . He loved to say things like " Beauty is only skin deep , you know ! " Or , pointing his stubby finger at Edie , " Money ca n't buy happiness , sweetie  --  it ca n't buy love . " Even that Christmas Day as he carried her among the guests , looking pleased and prosperous in his new suede jacket , he told everyone , " It 's days like this when we remember what 's important in life  --  am I right ? " And he jiggled Edie in his arms , up and down , and people said with their eyes crinkled half-shut how cute she was , and Edie felt the delicious thrill of ignoring them , simply putting her face to her father 's big shoulder and inhaling the expensive fresh aroma of that suede jacket . Surely this was happiness , surely this was the happiest moment of her childhood  --  though she did n't know it , then , and indeed its glory lay in not needing to " know " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's a moment Edie must now recall with jealous longing , with an emotion akin to dread . Sitting in this plush overstuffed armchair in Saks . Waiting for her mother , eternally waiting , the saleswoman chattering brightly into her ear . <p> Finally her mother emerges , wearing one of the dresses . And minutes later re-emerges , wearing another . After trying on six or seven outfits  --  asking Edie her opinion on each , not listening as Edie mumbles her noncommittal replies  --  Mrs. Goodman finally decides on two of them . One of which she prefers , but only slightly ; the second as a " spare , " in case she changes her mind . <p> Sometimes , when you get them home . . . <p> All the while Edie sits watching glumly from her chair . She has n't even unbuttoned her coat , and she supposes she must be getting warm ; but really she feels nothing . She imagines that she is a beached whale , enormous , numbed , immovable . . . and she recalls another cliche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's appearance that matters  --  it 's what 's on the inside . " Edie wonders if her father repeated this particular cliche to his women patients , the ones who came to his office shopping for expensive new faces . She wonders how he would react if she showed up one day and gave him her best dull-eyed glare and said , " What about me , Dr. Goodman ? Is there anything you can do for me ? " <p> Now her mother says emphatically to the saleswoman , handing her both the dresses , " Sometimes , when you get them home , they do n't look right after all . Yes , I 'd better take them both . I can always use a spare . " <p> So the matter is decided , and now there are shoes to buy , and earrings , and perhaps a scarf to drape across one shoulder , that 's become such a fashionable look .... As her mother makes these various purchases she hands the boxes and sacks to Edie , who has become expert these past few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacks inside larger ones , and all the while giving her opinion  --  " Yeah , well , I guess so "  --  whenever her mother requires it . In this way the hours pass . In this way Edie 's life passes . Once or twice she glances at her watch , adjusting the packages so that she can tilt her arm sideways , and she sees that it 's past two o'clock  --  and then it 's a quarter to three  --  and yes , this day of shopping is passing quickly like all the others . For , as her father used to say during their Saturday father-daughter outings years ago , " Time does pass quickly , does n't it ?  --  when you 're having fun . " <p> As if reading her mind , Mrs. Goodman now says , " Is n't this fun ? " Edie ca n't tell if she 's being ironic or not . They 're at the jewelry counter , where Edie 's mother has tried on perhaps three thousand pairs of earrings while Edie stands holding the half-dozen packages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still buttoned up to her throat . Countless bright lights shine down on this counter , to give the gold and diamonds an added sparkle , and Edie is very hot . Yes , she does feel the heat , she does have a heavy lardish perspiring body , and as she confronts this knowledge she stares down , as if from a great distance , at one of her hands  --  it does n't seem to be Edie 's hand , quite  --  and watches it dart inside one of the sacks and then out again . When it comes out , the hand is empty . The palm is sweating , and itching almost unbearably . <p> " Okay . I guess I 'll take these , " Mrs. Goodman says , when Edie does n't answer . Edie feels a gleam of sweat along her forehead and now , as her mother signs the ticket , she says , " Mother , would you carry a couple of these ? They 're getting heavy . " <p> " Sure thing , hoe , " her mother says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glow of satisfaction already pervading her chest , her stomach and limbs . . . oh yes , she definitely feels it . <p> Well , I guess we 've d one enough damage . . . <p> The jewelry salesman thanks Mrs. Goodman profusely and so here they are , in the middle of a wide aisle on the main floor of Saks , looking unmoored and disconsolate . Edie feels her mother 's tiny dark gleaming eyes brush past hers . <p> " Well , " Mrs. Goodman says , " I guess we 've done enough damage for one day . " <p> " Yes , " Edie says mildly . " I guess we have . " <p> Her mother turns and heads for the exit  --  not the mall exit but the one opening onto the lot where their Seville is parked . As though observing the scene in a dream , Edie watches her mother getting farther and farther away , moving with her usual bold strides , confident that her daughter is behind her , that her daughter 's legs have not turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumps of stone . Now Mrs. Goodman is out of sight , and within another five seconds Edie hears it  --  the security alarm , though in Saks even that sound is muted and almost pleasant , a low static humming  --  and now she sees a man , wearing a coat and tie , headed in the direction her mother has gone . Her mother , who has just stolen a pair of expensive gloves . <p> Already the glow of satisfaction in Edie 's belly is fading , dissolving , and in its place there is nothing . A blank sensation . An emptiness . Not a person 's appearance that matters  --  it 's what 's on the inside .... So she returns to the glove counter , the scene of the crime , and to the pile of beautiful vanilla-suede gloves still heaped on the counter , and again Edie takes two enormous handfuls and presses them to her face . She inhales deeply , greedily . When the saleswoman approaches again from behind the counter , asking her something , Edie smiles invisibly into the gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> By GREG JOHNSON <p>
