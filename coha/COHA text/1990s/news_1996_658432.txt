<p> Abe Trillin had a dream . <p> As the child of Russian immigrants living in St. Joseph , Mo. , early in this century , he read a heroic novel called " Stover at Yale . " The book so captured his imagination that years later , as a young man struggling to establish his first tiny grocery store , he began putting small amounts of money in a " Yale fund " for the son he assumed he would someday have . <p> Decades of six-day workweeks later , the grocer who had been born Abram Trilinsky somewhere " near Kiev " saw his American dream realized . In the spring of 1957 Abe Trillin and his wife , Edyth , traveled from Kansas City to New Haven , Conn. , to watch their son , Calvin , graduate from Yale University . That education gave the younger Trillin , who had edited the Yale Daily News , entree to Time magazine , marking the first step in an impressive career as a journalist , novelist , poet , playwright , and humorist . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a grocer so I would n't have to be , " says Calvin Trillin , who has turned his memories of his father into a touching portrait , " Messages From My Father " ( Farrar , Straus &; Giroux ) . <p> Two years ago , when Mr. Trillin wrote an essay about his father for The New Yorker , where he has been a staff writer since 1963 , it drew more mail than any other of the hundreds of pieces he has written for the magazine . <p> " I guess everybody has a father , " Trillin says in an interview , modestly trying to explain the response . He then expanded the essay into this book , finding " a lot of memories off in the corners that I had n't realized I had . " <p> Those memories portray a father whose " general thinking " was Midwestern . Believing that " proper behavior was modest behavior , " Abe Trillin had no time for people who boasted of their accomplishments or lived ostentatiously . " Big k'nockers , " he called them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big shot . " <p> He was a methodical man , rising at 4 each morning to drive to the city market to buy produce for his store . He believed that neatness counts . He prized highly shined shoes and carefully folded pocket handkerchiefs . And he always wore yellow neckties , a quirky signature to help him stand out from the crowd . <p> Thrifty but not stingy , the senior Trillin would buy a large bag of peanuts on the way to the ballpark rather than pay high prices for a tiny package at the stadium . He thought razor blades were " seriously overpriced . " And his notions of honesty were so black-and-white strict that he considered it wrong for an undersized boy to buy a child 's ticket at the movie theater the day after his 12th birthday . <p> Blessed with American optimism , Abe Trillin saw no limitations . He was also , his son recalls , " truly funny , " a man who delighted in collecting Yiddish curses and who , as a restaurant owner later in his career , wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't sigh/Eat pie . " <p> " Fathers of that era have been sort of underplayed , " observes Trillin . " It 's very hard business doing something you do n't want to do or that does n't make you happy in order to give your children opportunities . It 's very hard to think of yourself as a transition to something else . That was the position that most of my father 's friends were in . They worked hard in ways we ca n't imagine . " <p> His father , he adds , " had to work hard just to get a start . Nobody sent him to college . Nobody said , ' The world is your oyster - do whatever you want . ' " <p> Trillin and his father never had a heart-to-heart talk . But no matter . Even without specific words or lectures , the senior Trillin managed to convey to his son exactly how he expected him to behave . By indirection , he also made it clear that his son 's performance at school must not be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned well , carving out a career that has been anything but ordinary . His 19 books range from serious nonfiction to comic novels to three collections of food essays . He has appeared as a humorist on " The Late Show with David Letterman " and made a cameo appearance in " Sleepless in Seattle . " And as if to echo the verses on his father 's menus , he writes humorous " deadline poetry " every month for the Nation , using rhyming couplets to analyze the news . <p> As a writer , Trillin enjoyed the luxury of spending time at home with his two daughters , Abigail and Sarah . Even so , he tended to leave the heart-to-hearts to his wife . " I 'm only marginally better at that sort of thing than my father was , " he confesses . <p> " I obviously think that having a father is terribly important , since I ca n't conceive of what my life would be like without his guidance and aspirations for me , " Trillin says . " In the best of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daddy , but we do n't live that way . " <p> Although fathers today are more likely to talk about childrearing than were men of his father 's generation , Trillin says , " It does n't do you a whole lot of good to talk about it . People ask me if I have any advice about rearing children . I think that 's a question anybody gets if you have a couple kids and they have n't done any jail time . I always say , ' Try to get one that does n't spit up . ' Otherwise you 're sort of on your own , because you ca n't really set policies . " <p> Even so , Trillin sees heartening changes in family roles . " I think the revolution is here , " he says , citing the presence of diaper changing tables in men 's rooms on the Interstate as one example . <p> It is a long way from Southwest High School in Kansas City - " Mom , Dad , two kids , not rich , not poor " - to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice , raised Abigail and Sarah . Yet even there , Abe Trillin 's Midwestern values and strong moral code prevailed . Noting that he greatly valued his own " very square " upbringing , Calvin Trillin explains that his daughters ' upbringing was guided by a similar theme , namely : " Despite all evidence to the contrary , you are being raised in Kansas City . " He describes Kansas City as " a sort of moral compass " and " the norm against which everything else must be judged . " <p> Abe Trillin did n't live long enough to know his granddaughters or to watch Yale go coed . But had he been present in New Haven a few years ago when each granddaughter graduated from her father 's alma mater - the second generation of the family to benefit from that long-ago dream sparked by " Stover at Yale " - he undoubtedly would have been immensely happy . But not insufferably proud . That , after all , would violate his own inviolable rule : No big k'nockers in this family . <p> EXCERPTS FROM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was matter-of-fact about his belief that most people did n't leave a lasting impression . It was that belief , he said , that was behind his decision to wear only yellow neckties . This must have begun when I was in high school and my father was in the restaurant business . He said something about how most people do n't stand out from the crowd , and how it helped to have a sort of signature . His was going to be yellow neckties . They would n't necessarily be solid yellow , but yellow had to be the basic color . It struck me as a pretty dumb idea - actually , somewhere between dumb and embarrassing . I did n't see the point of identifying yourself by the color of your necktie . What was so great about having someone say , " Oh , yes , Abe Trillin - the guy with the yellow ties " ? <p> I do n't think I shared these reservations with my father . There may even have been an occasion or two in the ensuing years - a birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented him with a yellow tie . The problem of what to get your parents as gifts is often so acute that sons and daughters will leap upon any hint of a hobby or a collection , relentlessly marking birthdays year after year with fishing flies or elephant statuary , long after the parent in question has grown tired of fishing or come to the conclusion that elephants are not as graceful-looking as he once thought . With my father , of course , there was no danger that , between birthdays , he had given up his pledge to wear nothing but yellow ties . He did n't give up pledges . <p> * My father liked names . When he told stories to small children , there was often a character whose name sounded like Stoolie-allahmalochas . His version of Joe Blow was someone named Schlayma Puch , whose last name rhymed , more or less , with " schnook . " He handed out names to real people , and some of them stuck . His name for my mother 's first bridge-and-gossip set was the Clique Adorables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
