What is the future for physical education ? What does the crystal ball say ? How will the cards fall ? Mirror , mirror on the wall , which will be the fairest profession of all ? <p> A mystical perspective on the future of the profession may seem ludicrous , but is it really ? Many physical education professionals prefer not to know , care , or think about what may happen in the future . Numerous programs still use the antiquated curricula from the 1940 's and 1950 's ( Massengale , 1987 ) , and for many of these programs , the need for change is a topic that is too difficult to address and thus ignored . <p> A mystical intraspective may be a helpful , surprising experience for the physical education profession . According to Ellis ( 1988 ) , physical educators rarely ever use the final processing steps of problem solving which are learning and anticipation , but often stay in the beginning stage of problem solving which is survival . Requiring the physical education profession to consider the future , programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity to gain society 's approval and support . <p> Believing that a recovery was conceivable for the profession , John Massengale compiled and edited the book Trends Toward the Future in Physical Education ( 1987 ) approximately five years ago . The work consisted of 11 chapters written by several respected physical education professionals in which they all shared their views and information regarding the future of the profession . The respected professionals that contributed to the original book are Drs . Elizabeth Bressan , John Burr , Michael Ellis , Don Hellison , Shirl Hoffman , John Massengale , Alexander McNeill , Margaret ( Jo ) Safrit , George Sage , Thomas Templin , and Betty van der Smisson . Most of their forecasts were discouraging . However , all were significant and essential for consideration . Many of their " crystal ball " notions they espoused in the book have become reality in just 5 years . Method of Inquiry <p> Time has passed , and opinions can and do change . Therefore , the authors ' goal was to investigate through phone interviews with all reachable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine how they felt about physical education since the release of their book . A second goal was to examine if their postulates for the future of the physical education profession had been reformed , remained the same , or had been completely reprogrammed . Unfortunately , not all contributing could be reached . Elizabeth Bressan and Betty van der Smisson were out of the country during the interview process and were unavailable for comment . <p> In conducting the interviews , there were three set questions in which all authors responded . The questions were : ( 1 ) What did they foresee for physical education in the future ? , ( 2 ) How did they feel about the appropriateness of their own chapter in the book , and how have their past future forecasts had played out into today 's educational arena ? A general question was posed for unrestricted discussion : ( 3 ) What are the major factors ( present and future ) influencing the physical education profession ? All phone interviews were taped and reviewed for accuracy of response . The interviews usually lasted between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general was plentiful and thought provoking . Additionally , each individual conversation was enriching and stimulating enough to awaken even the most comatose physical educator . This arousal of the profession could lead to a reemergence for physical education into the forefront of any educational program . <p> The information gathered is presented as categorized by the major topical areas of economic factors , society 's perception , curriculum , research , teacher training , fragmentation , name change , women and minorities , litigation , and the positive outlook for physical education . Economic Factors <p> Economic issues seemed to hold the highest priority for the profession . Several authors interviewed , Drs . Burt , Ellis , Hellison , Hoffman , and McNeill , stated this problem to be paramount . If the funding for physical education can be counted on , the profession will be able to solve their other problems with ease . <p> The authors are still seriously concerned about the future for the physical education profession despite the warnings he gave in Massengale 's book especially due to the serious economic barriers that the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties and professions low in status ( i.e. physical education ) get cut first . Physical education seems to be in the midst of a tragedy and support is dwindling rapidly . <p> The decreasing economic support is hooked to the tax base , upon which contemporary physical education budgets depend , and is rapidly decreasing as a result of property tax limitations . There seems to be no real resolution for the tax base problem in this country and the " Graying of America " has helped to deflect monies from education . As the average age of the population increases , willingness to pay for education and youth services declines . The entire education profession is in peril and since physical education has been considered to have little value , they are among the prime candidates to be eliminated . <p> This issue is further expanded upon with the realization that everything in society , not just physical education , is threatened by economics . Two examples that are tied to physical education are the urban poor which badly need the attention of the profession , and outcomes-based education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on outcomes may be good business , but it reduces the potential affective/whole person benefits , many of which involve the quality of the process rather than the measured product and can only be measured indirectly . <p> Contemporary physical education has tried to deal with the economic upheaval by becoming more business-related . Unfortunately for physical education , this corporate attitude has tended to reduce the number of specialists in the gymnasiums with the arrival of several businesses that replace physical education programs in the schools . This growing " incorporation " of physical education clearly illustrates the economical woes for the profession . <p> The central issue , apparently , is that money has become the driving force behind the process rather than what is good for society . Economics and ethics are hooked into each other and the former is a tough competitor and , typically , comes out ahead . Unfortunately , not just physical education is in peril , but any educational program could fall into the money pit . The wellness programs of today also could face the same fate as physical education if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to designate their ultimate objective as to make clients self-responsible , but in reality measure program success by enrollment figures . There is a definite paradox between the objectives of self-responsibility and increased revenue due to high enrollment and it seems to be disorienting the wellness programs of today . Social Perception 's of Physical Education <p> Physical education of today is seen as a black sheep of the education family , and society in general concurs . Again , the authors that commented , Drs . Burt and Templin , felt that this issue is setting the stage of the profession 's decline , and is the main reason why funding is n't given to physical education . If society is to ever take physical education seriously , the profession must learn to take society seriously . <p> The authors were in agreement with the notion that the profession has aided in their demise . Physical education has n't convinced the country that they have made any contributions to society . Due to these deceptions , the profession has fallen back and is considered to be of lit-tie value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken the back seat in the educational world , a recent article in the Washington Post can be cited which showcased the plight of the contemporary teenager . The article displayed problems teenagers of today encounter and solutions for these problems . The commentary examined drug abuse , violence , and suicide , but presented boredom and stress as the chief causes for teenage problems . Not once was physical activity/ sports mentioned as a possible solution to eliminate boredom and stress . This exclusion is a representative illustration of how unimportant society considers physical education/activity . <p> In order to gain back some of the lost favor physical education once had , the profession needs to connect with what is real in society . The continuing lack of " connectedness " is causing society to abandon the profession as it exists today . The profession is plagued with " stand-offishness " , the inability to imagine what the profession could accomplish and the lack of effort integrating these ideas into programs . Instead , physical educators should search for what society needs , search for ways to accomplish these needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake . <p> However , there seems to be no immediate changes in how society views physical education . These prevailing attitudes are found in other countries as well . Current research being done with physical education teachers here in the United States and in England has studied the attitudes these teachers have toward the physical education profession . It seems that both sets of sample groups are discouraged and realize that physical education is marginally valued by society as a whole . Curricular Problems <p> A way to " connect " with society could be solved by teaching students lifelong skills , but most physical education programs are grounded in competitive team sports . Drs . McNeill and Ellis both asserted that the profession is doomed to file unless change occurs with this traditional notion of antagonistic sport and games curricula . The profession must move forward into the innovative strategies of teaching and focus on the necessities of lifelong skills instead of clinging to ancient methods and content areas . <p> A reason for this " do as we have done " attitude may be due to the rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as exercise physiology , sport administration , and motor development . This upheaval may be the reason that the past content has remained due to the fact that in times of chaos , people will stay where they feel most comfortable . The rationale for this breaking-up may have been in the student 's interest , but the profession has only confused the practitioner on what should be taught . <p> Therefore , the curricular objectives of many programs are ignoring what society wants . These programs of old tend to concentrate on the old-fashioned , zero-sum , competitive sports within their content taught which does little to help students in gaining a preparation for lifespan involvement in physical activity . Irrelevant Research <p> This issue of how research generated by universities communicates what is important was discussed with sentiment toward the practitioner . It seems that the participants who commented , Drs . Hellison and Hoffman , felt the research generated by the universities is not usable . The practitioners who are the foundation for the profession can not and will not decipher the academic essays found in the journals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The irrelevancy of research done by the profession 's academic culture has created barriers between the universities and the schools , and this " out of touch " research is increasing the gap between practitioner and professor . Researchers should become more connected to the practice of physical education and they need to " think differently " or to collaborate with the people that will benefit most from research done in physical education ; teachers and students . <p> Despite warnings given in Massengale 's book on this subject , " Old Comp U " is continuing with research that is useless for the practitioner . In order to facilitate a change , there needs to be a " coming together " of the American Alliance for Health , Physical Education , Recreation and Dance ( AAHPERD ) /public school culture and the university culture . The AAHPERD/public school culture is n't listening to the universities because the research generated by the universities is too academic and not applicable to the field . Usually , this research is directed toward other university personnel and not at the practitioner level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultures are far apart with the university culture having the biggest impact on society . There seems to be a need for a new generation of professionals integrated into the field that appreciates its existence . Teacher Training <p> The loss of social responsibility seems to be the root of the profession 's demise and is clearly illustrated in how physical education prepares their future teachers . There is a general agreement between the leaders commenting on this problem , Drs . McNeill and Sage , on how the profession is turning out graduates who are unfinished . Since contemporary physical education graduates are unfinished and the physical educators already out there are perceived to be inadequate , it may be accurate to expect their students will be incomplete as well . <p> The profession has helped to create this problem by fracturing the whole body into little parts , but has put little effort in putting the parts back together . University programs examine separately the physical , social , intellectual , and psychological parts of the human body , but does n't instruct how to add up these parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " body " of the profession consequently does not give direction to the practitioner on how to travel , and most teachers end up lost . <p> Most teacher preparation programs in physical education are presently emphasizing kinesiology and the scientific components of the training program . In lieu of this concentration , these programs are turning out only half-educated graduates . These graduates then are seriously lacking in the humanities of the profession such as the historical and philosophical components of sport . Due to this concentration on muscle fibers and distal attachments , the profession is instructing their future professionals to look at each student as a machine and not as a person . Fragmentation of the Profession <p> The profession is currently dealing with the issue of splintering into specialty content areas such as biomechanics , sports history , and sports pedagogy . In the past , this specializing was considered healthy for physical education , but lately has shown signs of breaking the profession apart . Drs . Hoffman , McNeill and Sage all commented on the upheaval this contemporary issue has had on physical education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to show it has not been beneficial for the profession . <p> The issue of fragmentation within the physical education profession is still unresolved and only time will show its effects . Fragmentation of the profession was initiated in numerous collegiate programs to better serve the student . Due to this departmental action , a prolific number of universities have changed their names from physical education to general titles such as Human Performance Studies in order to include all the specialties . This clearly illustrates that the day is long gone for just the teacher preparation programs , and because of this , physical education teacher preparation faculty feel lower in status than other fragmented area faculty . <p> Dr. Sage cited an issue that no one else identified in association with the fragmentation issue . The hustling for external funds or grants which has takers universities by storm . These adored grants are not as available to the areas in teacher preparation , sport sociology , and sport philosophy , but are increasingly available to the natural sciences . Grants are being awarded to the fragmented areas and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to the best grant hustlers . Therefore , the teacher preparation faculty realize a lower status and receive fewer rewards in university life . <p> The fragmenting of physical education into specialties was not considered healthy in Massengale 's book , and is still not recommended . It seems that physical education needs to come together as one profession . The " education " of physical education was the beginning point and should be emphasized within the profession . <p> The " breaking apart " of the profession is changing physical education and the challenges for physical education in the future are centered in how the profession deals with the issues emerging from this specialization . There needs to be a firm foundation for physical education to start re-building and due to this breaking apart , the solid framework is not there . Name Change <p> Going hand in hand with the fragmentation issue , there seems to be concern over the recent phenomenon of changing the name of physical education at numerous universities . Drs . Hellison , Massengale , and Sage identified this contemporary issue and noted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to simply gain respect for their profession within the university . <p> The name change matter appears to be a fad that is turning into a trend . The favorite choice of the numerous names that universities designate for their former " Physical Education " departments is " Kinesiology " . This is due to the scientific , scholarly orientation that " kinesiology " portrays to the other departments on campus as well as central university administrators . <p> Additionally , in the last 20 years , over half of the physical education departments in major universities with enrollments of over 15,000 students have changed their name . Currently , over 30% are in the process of a name change . It seems only the small colleges will keep " physical education " as the name of choice . Another significant statistic relative to the name change issue is that of the 100 or more universities that have changed their names , none have changed back . <p> The issue of the name change at several universities has added to the confusion within the profession . Society will clearly view this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accentuate the displeasure with which physical education has lived in the education field , and in everyday life . Women and Minorities <p> There was only one author that commented on this emerging issue of equity for women and minorities in physical education . Since Dr. Safrit 's chapter in Massengale 's book dealt with the future for women in the profession , she noted that young women of today seem to be better prepared for the competitive scene at the university level than when she wrote her chapter . Ironically , it is discouraging that women leave the university setting earlier because of lack of support . Overall , society has seen minimal gains for women and minority groups , but realize this is mainly lip service rather than action . Physical education should take more time and give more support to keep good women and minority practitioners in these positions as well as to promote more diversity within the profession . Litigation Upheaval <p> Another issue discussed by a single author was the daily increase of litigation in physical education and how the profession has dealt with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the academic area of sport law , as an important trend . Since 1986 , the tremendous development of this law specialty has created a new avenue for the profession . It may also be an dangerous avenue depending on how the profession deals with the explosion in this focused area . Entire law practices are specializing in this area which further shows how lucrative this trend can be in our society . Also , this growing area reveals the increasing amount of lawsuits within the profession which may allow society to perceive physical educators as negligent , or negligently trained . Positive Outlook for Physical Education <p> Even though the preceding forecasts for physical education can he construed to be negative , the profession can become again a necessary part of education and society . A majority of the authors interviewed , Drs . Ellis , Hellison , McNeill , Safrit and Templin , still believed that physical education could be a tremendous asset to all . The profession it appears just needs to concentrate on its positive points which are numerous . Also , as time goes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as look toward the future in order to gain insights to help achieve objectives at present . <p> Despite previous discussion , the future for the physical education profession could be construed to be headed in the right direction . If looked at positively , the profession has responded well to the splintering into sub-special-ties because the profession has responded to many students ' needs as well as society 's demands . Physical education has moved ahead in many diverse directions which has helped to broaden the profession 's base especially due to the inclusion of health and wellness into the profession 's curricular agenda . This readjustment to the profession could positively augment how society perceives physical education . <p> Although the physical education profession is not as identifiable as it was 20 years ago , the field will not decline . A key area of concern , however , may be the quality of the high school physical education programs which has appeared to have stagnated . Even considering this limitation , the physical education profession can overcome this problem . <p> In order to facilitate this reemergence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the workplace . This objective can be met if more publications and promotions of good programs are accomplished . This will aid the profession in illustrating to society that physical education can hold a substantial place within the school 's mission . <p> The profession could easily help itself by targeting the political field as a means to gain monetary support . In turn , this can lead to the empowerment of the profession 's leaders and teachers . This political influence is extremely important and the profession needs to have it on their side . If the profession has this political clout , then practitioners can speak up and know that they will be heard . <p> Paradoxically , the " business " of physical education is good . The country is extremely interested in health and wellness and the " new " physical education needs to focus on this trend . Even though the profession seems to be ignoring this opportunity , they still can come to the realization for the need to capitalize on this issue so as to travel toward the profession 's self-actualization . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be beneficial for the profession . <p> Paramount to the rebirth of the profession is the issue of what should be concentrated on by professionals teaching in the schools today . They should focus on the real , valued effects of physical education , not just on trivial entertainment opportunities upon which many curricula are based . Instead of teaching zero-sum , competitive sports , the teachers in the field need to be cognizant of what society wants , which are skills and activities that lead to improved health and quality of life . Their mission should be a preparation for lifespan involvement in a healthy life-style ; a goal that minimally involves team sports . If this goal is met , physical education will become reborn and help to direct society forward . <p> As stated before , researchers at the university-level should " think differently " , but additionally practitioners also need to " think differently " . One example which was suggested is the " club concept " where specific sport or fitness clubs meet during or after school for physical education credit . The future of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession comes together and begins to conceptualize solutions by " thinking differently " . <p> Physical education can accomplish this " thinking differently " by including a holistic approach when training future physical education teachers . Instead of concentrating on " how " the body works , the profession needs to focus within teacher preparation courses on the total body and mind working in conjunction with each other . Fitting the body parts together before the teacher begins teaching would give beginning teachers a head start into promoting a healthy profession . Recommendations <p> Examination of the most common . issues from the cavalcade of experts revealed the profession of physical education can deal with the challenges of the future . All the interviewees were in agreement , however , that physical education as we know it today does not have a future . Physical education must change for survival . <p> The profession of physical education needs to deal immediately with all of those newly emerging issues , fads and trends . Acceptance for the profession can be achieved if practitioners and universities listen to what society wants and work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Contemporary issues will irrevocably change the profession and can lead them to solutions that will gain society 's favor : <p> After careful review of the opinions stated by the authorities interviewed , specific suggestions for the profession 's success became clear . Have a better alliance between practitioners &; universities . This is essential to many factors dealing with success of a program . This will help communicate the need for more practical research and a more holistic teacher preparation program . Attending/ arranging university based workshops is a good first step . Market/promote your program . Once you have an outstanding program , tell everyone about it , especially parents , administrators , and the media who will reach the other tax payers . This will bolster the economic support for the profession . Unify with health . Teaching motor skills is n't enough . A " healthy child " is typically one of the profession 's goals and joining with the health profession will aid the physical education profession in the achievement of that goal . Also this alliance may open up more avenues for grant monies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet unresolved as to its positive or negative points . Research could be helpful in settling this concern . Revise teacher preparation programs . Newborn teachers need a better " balance " within their undergraduate preparation programs . Not only do these teachers need the " science " ( i.e. anatomy , physiology ) , but they also require the " art " ( i.e. history , philosophy ) . Have an open mind- " think differently " . Do n't teach like you were taught . Survey people connected to your program ( parents , students , etc. ) for additional insights . Evaluate and change what you have to better fit society 's needs into the program . <p>
