<p> FOR Christos and Maria Petropoulos , the week of Easter means big business and little sleep . As owners of Vouros Pastry Shop , specializing in Greek sweets , they 'll be mixing , kneading , and baking nonstop for eager customers in the never-ending line that annually snakes in and out of their front door . <p> The item in demand is tsoureki ( pronounced tsoor-ECK-ee ) , the traditional Greek Easter bread . <p> " The whole week we sleep here , " says Mrs. Petropoulous with a sigh . " I just go home to take a bath and I come back . " <p> Searching for the correct word , the couple settles upon " tired " to explain the frazzled state they are in by the time Greek Easter Sunday ( April 7 this year ) rolls around - even with the help of 10 or so family members . <p> " You would n't recognize them , " says Anna Scarlotos , a fan of the shop who works at the Greek Consulate in Boston . <p> Bread made especially for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hot Cross Buns and Swedish Semlor to Russian Kulich and Polish Babka . " Bread , since the early days of Christianity , has marked the beginning of the splendid feast of Easter , " writes Norma Voth in her book " Festive Breads of Easter . " <p> Greek tsoureki is perhaps one of the most festive of all Easter breads , recognizable by its crimson eggs and braided shape . <p> In Greece , Easter is the most celebrated holiday of the year - even more so than Christmas . Diane Kochilas knows this well . " The country closes down for about four or five days , " says Ms. Kochilas , who divides her time between New York and Greece . " Generally what happens is people go back to their villages and spend Easter there ... It 's an ushering-in of Spring . " <p> Bread is very much a part of the Greek culture - as food and as folklore . " You just do n't eat without it , " says Kouchilas , who has recently published " The Food and Wine of Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In it , she writes : " Bread is a sacred food , a utensil , a good luck charm , a folk art , a gift , a token to commemorate the milestones of life . " <p> More than just a fancy bread <p> So it follows that tsoureki is more than just a fancy braided bread with colored eggs . It is rich in history and symbolism , and plays a big part in Greek Easter celebrations . " It 's not so much a dessert , as much as sweetened bread that 's symbolic of resurrection and life , " said Kouchilas by phone from New York . <p> The word tsoureki is Turkish for " that which is kneaded , " says Kochilas . The bread probably came to Greece through Constantinople ( modern-day Istanbul ) . The crimson eggs that decorate it , a custom in Byzantium , symbolize the blood of Christ as well as eternity and fertility , she says . The three long dough cords that are braided to form the loaf symbolize the holy trinity . <p> Like any traditional recipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrange the hard-boiled eggs in the dough before baking , others poke them in afterward ; some top with sesame seeds , others sprinkle on slivered almonds ; some braid three dough ropes , others twist with two . Recipes differ . <p> But no one questions the bread 's appetite-satisfying value . At Easter , " there 's an element of anticipation " about tsoureki , says Kochilas . " You have to keep in mind that , by and large , people do fast . " And this makes the sweet bread that much more of a treat . <p> According to Ms. Scarlotos , some in the Greek Orthodox Church " fast " for 40 days , going without meat and dairy products , while others will just fast the week before Easter Sunday . Compared to with the " every day " bread the Greeks eat , which is hearty and rough , tsoureki is a sweet bread - a lot like Jewish Challuh , says Kochilas - rich with things fasters have been missing : eggs and butter . <p> Then again , there are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we used to sneak out and take it , " says Mrs. Petropoulos , who grew up on the Greek island of Kalymnos . <p> Traditionally , after midnight services on Saturday , Greeks go back to their homes and break their fast by cracking the red hard-boiled eggs ( symbolic of Christ coming out of the tomb ) , then eating them as well as tsoureki and a taste of meat . The big feast in on Sunday , typically : lettuce salad , spinach pie , mageiritza soup , eggs , roast lamb , potatoes , cheese , sweet-cheese pastries and tarts , and fruit . <p> " The Easter bread is one of the most important and symbolic foods we prepare in conjunction with the holiday , " says Katherine Boulukos , chairwoman for the Recipe Club of Saint Paul 's Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Hempsted , N.Y. , which put together " The Complete Book of Greek Cooking " ( Harper &; Row , $27.95 , 1990 ) . " The most unusual thing about the bread is it 's a sweet bread ; it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mahlepi ( cherry-flavored seeds that are pulverized ) or masticha ( special sap from the mastichodenro bush ) give the bread an unusual flavor . One can substitute vanilla extract , but a Greek would tell you that tsoureki is not tsoureki without one of those special Greek flavorings . <p> Special spice required <p> " Without it , it 's like Wonder bread , " Ms. Scarlotos says , speaking of the mahlepi the Petropoulouses use . Because of working hours in this country , more people are buying their tsoureki from shops such as the Petropouloses ' , she says . They make thousands of loaves for the holiday . Each batch takes about eight hours to make , from start to finish ( including rising time ) , which is why those who do bake at home will usually make more than one . <p> " I love this bread ; I make it all the time , " says Ms. Boulukos . " It makes great French toast , " she reveals . Boulukos 's fondness for the bread started at a very young age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did once to my mother ! " she laments over the phone . Her mother made several tsourekia for Easter festivities and kept one hidden to save for a special uncle who was away at the time . But Boulukos - about 8 years old at the time - found it . " I ate the whole thing from the underneath , " she recalls . " When she went to lift it , it crumpled . The horror on my mother 's face when she picked up the loaf ! <p> " I loved it so . I just decided I was more important than the uncle . My mother never let me forget it . " <p> As they say in Greek , kali orexi or " good appetite . "
