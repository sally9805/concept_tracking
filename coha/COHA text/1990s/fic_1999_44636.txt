At this writing , Jerry Oltion is in Hawaii researching the novel-length expansion of Abandon in Place , " a story of his you might recall from a couple of years ago . We should all be so lucky as to face such difficult research assignments . Or perhaps our luck should land us on a planet such as the one described herein  --  Lady Luck wears many faces . <p> THE AUTOPILOT BROUGHT the lander in fast , braking hard over the tiny clearing in the forest and setting down before the fusion flame could set the trees on fire . That did n't seem like a big danger it was raining like a waterfall out there - but Darran figured the first person to visit a planet that might be inhabited should be careful not to cause any more damage than necessary . The computer said , " Contact , " and a moment later the automatic levelers adjusted the floor angle . Darran shut off the drive and spoke into his pressure suit mike . " I 'm down . View out the port is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rain water to see much detail , but tell Boglietti his planet 's chartreuse . " Richard Boglietti had discovered the planet while the Pioneer was still half a light-year out from Altair , but he was n't the explorer type . He was an astronomer ; the overall system held more interest for him than did the planet itself . The starship 's two other crewmembers were excited enough , but they were both in the infirmary with a virus they 'd gotten from one of the passengers coming out of hibernation , and none of the sleepers would be ready for duty for over a week . It fell to Darran , who had been born twenty-two years ago en route from the Sirius colony and had never before set foot on anything not manmade , to speak the first words from the surface . And to find out why there were no cities or obvious signs of habitation despite a constant low-level microwave hum that came from practically everywhere . He tried not think too much about the responsibility he 'd been given . It would probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signals ; the microwaves probably came from a natural source . He closed his suit visor . " I 'm buttoning up to go out- " " Warning , " said the computer . " External cooling air pumps one and two have failed . " Darran looked to the control panel for confirmation , saw two red lights blinking there . Then another one . He looked at the label just as the computer spoke again . " Main engine fuel line failure . " Was he under attack ? But the external sensors registered no motion outside . Besides , the air pumps and fuel line were inside the hull ; they would be impossible to hit without taking half a dozen other subsystems with them . It had to be a spontaneous failure , even though the lander had worked fine all the way down through the thick atmosphere . But that was just the beginning . A wave of warning lights swept across the board , starting in the drive section and working steadily across the attitude control jets and external sensors , then blinking on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm voice could n't keep up with it . " Computer , shut up , " Darran told it . " I 've got a cascade failure of some sort , " he said for the benefit of the people in orbit . He was proud of how calm he sounded . It had to be an instrumentation problem ; that many separate systems could n't fail at once . Then he felt a thump from beneath the deck and heard the screech of metal giving way under too much stress , and he decided maybe they could . The computer broke silence to say , " Situation critical . Eject now , " but he was already shouting , " Eject , eject ! " If the control board could be believed , the fuel tank had just ruptured . He felt a hard jolt , and the instruments went dead : Either the tank had blown and he would be dead in a millisecond or two himself , or ... Heavy acceleration shoved him back in his seat . Motion outside the viewport drew his attention from the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe a hundred feet above the treetops . Fast . The computer had fired the eject rocket , then immediately turned it sideways to give him the best chance of escaping the explosion . A ragged , cylindrical chunk of tree shot past , and a second later the control cabin shook as the blast caught up with him . He saw sky , then trees , then sky again , and he felt his harness straps reel him in tight to the seat . He hit the forest backwards . It felt like the first tree snapped off , and the second one flexed , bouncing him back the way he 'd come . The viewport offered little clue : he saw branches slap the glass-a particularly big one put a starfish crack in it - and then he felt a hard jolt forward and everything went dark . The control cabin had plowed face-first into the ground . " I 'm alive , " he said , amazed . He did n't even hurt anywhere . His heart was pounding like crazy , but he had survived without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said again . " Darran to Pioneer . Come in , Pioneer . " The external antenna had no doubt been scraped away in the crash , and his suit radio apparently was n't strong enough to punch through the hull and a hundred miles of soggy air on its own . He would have to go outside and try it . " Computer ? " he said . Silence . " Oh , great . " He peered closely at the control panel , looking for the reset button . A few warning lights still burned there , but they did n't provide enough illumination to see by . The emergency cabin lights did n't respond to his command either , so he flipped on his suit 's headlamp . Its beam looked eerily blue after all that green a moment ago . There was the reset button , up in the corner where he would n't hit it by accident . He pushed it , waited a second , then said " Computer ? " Still nothing . Definitely time to try calling for help from outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple deep breaths and unbuckled , then climbed up on the seat so he could reach the airlock . The planet 's low gravity helped some with that ; he was able to pull himself up with just his arms . The inner door slid smoothly into the wall when he punched the cycle button ; he hit the emergency stop when it was two-thirds of the way open so he 'd have a ledge to stand on , then climbed in and took one of the laser pistols from its clip in the airlock . He did n't really think he had been attacked , but it reassured him to hold the laser anyway . Nothing happened when he pushed the button to open the outer door . He was n't surprised ; there was a big dent where the door had met with a tree . He opened the access panel beside it , broke the security strip over the red T-handle , and yanked that sideways . The explosive bolts went off with a bang and the hatch tumbled away to land with a splat on the wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin again , along with a shower of rainwater . " Hello Pioneer , " he said again , standing on the partly closed inner door and sticking his head cautiously outside . If natives had attacked him , they could be out there now , waiting to finish him off . He held his pistol ready , but he knew he would n't have a chance against more than one or two opponents . He could n't really believe he 'd been fired on anyway , not that quickly . Anything intelligent enough to invent a weapon would be curious enough to see who he was before they shot at him , would n't they ? Nothing moved . He switched off his headlamp . He could hear , muffled somewhat by his pressure suit helmet , the hiss of rain beating against the skin of the lander . And against his helmet . He felt a thrill run up his spine , a surge of excitement that had nothing to do with the crash . He was down on a planet , getting rained on by water that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of it had . Darran inched his head upward and peered all the way around in a circle . Was anyone watching him ? The idea made him shiver again . He had hoped to meet aliens , but not under these circumstances . " Come in , Pioneer , " he said . " Caitlin ? Rich ? Do you read ? " Nothing . He was beginning to realize that he could be in serious trouble here . He was used to life on the ship , where help was only a deck or two away even in the most serious of problems , but here he was hundreds of miles from home at its closest approach . They had another shuttle on board , and the big cargo lander , but if the crew thought he was dead they would n't send either down until they knew what had killed him . He might have to spend the night in the truncated remains of the shuttle , living in his pressure suit and hoping his air purifier did n't give out . He loohed back to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smooth line even with the inside deck ; everything but a set of emergency batteries and his airtank had gone with the drive section . Rain poured in through the hatch at his feet and dripped onto the control panel . It did n't matter ; there was nothing left to control , but he might be spending quite a bit of time in there waiting for rescue . He climbed out , his back itching at the thought that someone - something - might have him in its sights , and pushed the button that closed the inner door . From atop the hull he looked out at the forest , the trees towering over him , anything farther than a few dozen feet half hidden in the downpour . Even so , there was a lot of biology out there - way more than he was used to on the ship , even in the garden . The trees rose up tall and straight , about ten or twenty feet apart and without branches for the first thirty feet or so , then they sprouted a four-foot diameter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a giant mushroom , and above that they had more conventional branches . He could n't tell if they were needled or leafed or something else , not with the rain streaking his faceplate . The forest canopy did n't seem to slow the downpour much . Down below the trees , bushes and flowers and vines and a thousand other plants competed for space on the ground . Everything was green , even the flowers , as if he had a green filter on his helmet ; and the sky glowed bright even though the cloud deck was about forty thousand feet thick . He was glad for that much shade , he had in fact picked this landing site rather than a clear spot because of it , so he would n't fry in direct sunlight . Altair was nine times brighter than the Sun , even though Boglietti 's Planet circled it a lot farther out than Earth circled Sol , it was still too hot and bright for human comfort out in the open . Well , Darran was here to explore . His heart pounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried , " Stranded , stranded ! " but if he could n't contact the ship he 'd better have a look around to see what he could do to help himself . He walked along the curved hull until it became too steep to stand on , then turned and began to climb carefully to the ground . It would be easy enough to climb back up ; gravity was only about two-thirds that on the ship , and most of the handgrips and tiedowns had survived the trip through the trees . Or so he thought . The second one he put his weight on gave way under his boot , and he tumbled to the ground . Fortunately he landed on his butt , but the suit did n't like it even so . The alarm voice said , " Suit integrity breached . Overpressurizing to avoid atmospheric intrusion . " " Cancel that , " he said . His ears popped , then popped again . The crew had already determined by spectroscopic analysis from orbit that the air was breathable ; there was no sense pouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inevitable . He reached up to his helmet and lifted the faceplate , tensing at the idea of taking his first breath of an alien atmosphere . The faceplate came off in his hands . He stood there , smelling the rich , fragrant air and listening to the suddenly louder hiss of rain while he stared blankly at the shallow bowl of clear plastic which had , only half an hour ago in orbit , kept him protected from vacuum when he transferred over from the Pioneer to the lander . And which had done the same during countless other EVAs throughout his life on board the starship . He looked at it more closely . Nothing wrong with it that he could see . He tilted his head back as far as he could inside his helmet and looked at the channel the faceplate was supposed to slide in . There was the trouble . The metal track that held the silicon rubber seal had bent outward , as if under incredible pressure . Which was ridiculous , of course . That kind of pressure would have crushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frame , and the problem immediately became obvious . The metal track stretched and came away in his hands like warm modeling plastic . He tugged at the headlamp and it did the same . Its batteries flashed in a loud spark as they shorted out . Something was eating his pressure suit . His laser pistol sizzled . He instinctively flung it away , as if it had transformed into a huge bug . It hit the ground and flashed brilliant blue when its power pack discharged . In blind panic he scrambled back up the side of the lander , but the handholds pulled loose and he wound up on his back again . He tried kicking holes directly in the softened hull for his feet and punching handholds to grab , but he made it no farther than before . The whole skin of the lander was sloughing away . As were the boots and gloves of his pressure suit . This was what had happened to the air pumps . They had been sucking in cooling air all the way down from orbit . Darran was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Help ! " he shouted , hoping his suit radio might somehow reach the ship . " I 'm falling apart down here ! It 's like acid , or - hell , I do n't know what it is , but it 's eating everything ! " No response from the ship , but he heard a groan from the shuttle and looked up at the curved wall , then took a few nervous steps backward . It was hard to walk on the springy , uneven ground . Water and little plants squished between his toes , and harder plants poked at the soles of his feet through the deteriorating boots . The soft stuff felt disgusting , and the sharp stuff scared him silly . He expected his skin to go the same way as his pressure suit any moment now , starting with whatever spot got the first scratch . The lander slumped like a melting sugar cube . The rounded wall buckled , and with a wet slurp like the sound of a ripe melon being ripped apart the walls fell away , exposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they dissolved , too , and waited with mounting terror for his body to do the same . The pressure suit shredded away like wet tissue paper , all but the faceplate , which he clutched in his hand while his clothing started to disintegrate , but his body remained unaffected . Long after the p-suit and his clothes were gone and the lander had become an unrecognizable lump of decayed metal , he stood there , alone and naked on an alien world . The rain felt like a hot shower against his bare shoulders . On board the ship he had loved the sensation . Sometimes he would shower until his skin wrinkled like a raisin 's , luxuriating in the endless supply of recycled engine cooling water . The supply here seemed equally endless , but far less comforting . At least it was warm . He laughed when he realized that . At least it was warm . Count your blessings , his mother had always told him ; well , there was one . His laughter quickly edged over toward hysteria . He fought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he had n't . Nor had his faceplate . And now that he looked closely at the molten puddle of silvery metal that had been his lander , he saw a few other pieces of plastic that had survived . He wondered how long that would last . The metal was still seething with activity . Not quite boiling , but there was plenty of reaction going on there . What sort of reaction ? That was the question . Acids ate metals , did n't they Could there be some kind of acid in the rain ? He had a hard time believing it . Sure acids ate metals , but the hull was mostly titanium and it had disappeared like that . Any kind of acid that corrosive would have eaten him as well , would n't it ? He shuddered again . Do n't think about that , he told himself . Do n't even begin to think about that . You 're not dissolving . Maybe there could be some kind of acid that ate metal but not flesh . This was an alien world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic compounds unheard of anywhere else , including acids . Or microbes , for that matter . Maybe it was something alive that liked metal but not people . Or any organic molecule of sufficient complexity . That would explain why some of the plastic parts had n't dissolved . He bent down and ripped up a handful of green moss from between his feet . At least it looked like moss . Dark green . It felt squishy and a little bit coarse , as if its individual cells were larger and stiffer but joined more loosely to one another than Terran cells . It smelled musty , alive . Maybe a little like the chlorella algae in the air tanks . If he 'd been on board the Pioneer he could have analyzed its chemical makeup in a few minutes , even mapped its DNA if that 's what it used for genetic coding , but here he had no tools at all . It looked like a grainy plant ; that was all he could say about it . He looked up again . Still no sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it did n't seem as likely now . He wondered if anyone was warming up the other lander yet . Despite his fervent wish for rescue , he hoped they would n't . Whatever got him would almost undoubtedly get them , too . Even if they were able to land and take off again without dissolving , they 'd never make it all the way back into orbit before the acid-or whatever it was - ate into something critical and the drive blew them all over the sky . He had to warn them . But how ? He had no radio , no weapon to signal with , no way to make a fire-nothing except the curved plastic faceplate from his spacesuit . He could n't even lay out a message for them to read through the clouds with hi-definition radar , because there was nothing to lay it out with and no clearing to lay it out in . Or was there ? The one speck of non-green color in the entire forest , besides the pool of metal slowly draining into the mud at his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of the lander had broken on its way down . It lay on the ground almost at the edge of vision between a couple of still-standing trunks . Without its branches it would make a pretty good log . A mile or so back through the trees there was undoubtedly a big supply of similar logs , probably already broken into convenient pieces , and a nice big clearing to arrange them in . If he could ever find it in this dense forest . At that thought the little voice in the back of his mind screamed , " You 're lost ! " but he took a deep breath and looked up at the trees , trying to spot the still-standing half of the broken one . He had to shield his eyes from the rain so he could see , but there it was beyond the melted lander , snapped off just above its mushroom ring . From the angle between that and the piece on the ground , it looked like the original landing site had to be off to the left . Darran looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lander . Should he fish out any of the surviving plastic pieces ? He did n't want to abandon anything he might need later , but he did n't know how he could carry more than a handful of stuff , and he could n't bring himself to reach into the quivering mass of decomposition anyway . With one last backward glance to fix the location in his mind in case he needed to return , Darran set off through the trees . He stepped gingerly at first , feeling awkward and more vulnerable than he 'd ever felt in his life . He was squeamishly aware of every plant he crushed and of the muck that oozed around his feet , but he soon realized he could n't watch his footing and keep his bearings at the same time . He resolutely kept his gaze straight ahead , picking a shadowy trunk in the rain and walking toward it , then picking another one in the same direction and walking to that , only looking down when he felt something particularly disgusting underfoot . He felt like throwing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or whatever had happened to the lander might finally be happening to him , but he forced that thought away again . If that was the case he could n't do anything about it . Nor , he realized , could he do much about fear or revulsion . Even now , fifteen minutes or so after the crash , his heart still pounded loud enough to hear over the rain . And all the living ... stuff everywhere spooked him just as badly as being stranded . Twenty-two years on board a starship , with its metal corridors and potted plants , had n't prepared him for the squishiness of life on a planet . And if he never took another shower again in his life , it would be too soon . A piercing screech from off in the forest made him forget about the rain . That had been an animal . A big one , by the sound of it . He leaped instinctively for the closest tree and scraped his hands and knees as he tried to scramble up it , but he paused about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't warn the ship . He had to get to the clearing . He dropped back to the springy moss and forced himself to keep walking , trying to look everywhere at once and wondering what he would do if he saw whatever had made the noise . One worry proved unfounded , at least : there was no way he could miss the site of the explosion . Every hundred yards or so he came across debris from it , and a little examination of the skid marks in the ground invariably showed him the direction it had come from . He paused long enough at the first log to wrench free a branch , twisting it around and around until the tough fibers joining it to the trunk suddenly softened and broke free ; then he busted off the other end the same way and pulled off the twigs . They ended in two-foot-long triangular leaves , which fluttered loosely on flimsy stems attached to the narrowest point . When he was done he had a six-foot club . It lent him a degree of confidence that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club before , but it felt good to know that he was - in theory at least armed . The club could even double as a rough spear if he could just figure out how to sharpen it . A rock would do , but there were none to be seen . Everything was covered with a thick mat of moss or bushes . There were n't even any rocks among the ejecta from the explosion . That seemed a bit strange . Surely a fuel tank explosion would have dug down to bedrock . Positron plasma was as powerful as fuel got ; even though there was n't that much of it in the lander 's tank there was enough to scoop out a good-sized crater . When he arrived at the site he saw that he was at least partly right . The explosion had flattened trees for a quarter mile around , and in the middle of them all , the center of the bull's-eye , was a deep lake . But no rock . The sides of the crater were a black , viscous goo . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was flowing like thick grease , slowly filling in the depression . It looked alive , buzzing with activity just like the remains of the control cabin . Not only that , but this was purposeful activity , as if it knew the ground had been damaged and was moving in to repair the wound . Darran backed away from the crater . If his hair had n't been so soggy it would have been standing on end . The ground was alive ? There was definitely too much biology here . He wanted back on board the Pioneer , back to clean , carpeted decks and flat metal walls . There was no sign of the lander , probably would n't have been even without whatever it was that ate non-living things . Not after that explosion . Darran looked around for any creatures capable of making the noise he 'd heard earlier , but he saw nothing larger than an insect , and precious few of those . Once he confirmed that he was alone he set his club and the faceplate down and walked over to a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty feet long , grabbed it by a stub of a branch , and dragged it close to the crater . The light gravity made it just possible if he leaned into it . Then he went back for another and set it at an angle next to the first one . And so on for an hour or longer , pausing to rest only after he 'd spelled out " DO N'T LAND " in block letters . He was especially proud of the apostrophe , even though that was the easiest part . The work made him thirsty , so he stopped long enough to drink the water that had accumulated in his p-suit faceplate . He wondered what sort of alien microbes were in it , but he 'd already breathed enough to kill him if they were going to . It tasted just like ship 's water , even down to the slightly metallic flavor that he had always assumed was from the recycler . Maybe that was just the way water tasted , because there certainly could n't be any metal here . He was growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot hungrier before he tried eating any of the native plant life . He went back to work with more logs , spelling out " METAL MELTS . " He used smaller pieces for that , figuring the people on the Pioneer could use higher-resolution radar once they saw that he was trying to spell something . Once he knew for sure he had their attention he could probably just use hand signals . Or maybe not . Radar would pass right through him . He spent a bad moment wondering if it would pick up a tree , but then he remembered they had used it to find the clearing he 'd originally landed in . That and infra-red . So he could assume they had seen his message . That meant the other lander was safe , but he was still no closer to rescue . Until they found out what was responsible for this mess in the first place , they could n't send anyone to get him . He sat down on the " D " in " DO N'T LAND , " its crinkly surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippery . He pushed into it with a finger and penetrated up to the second knuckle before he hit hard wood . It had been solid when he laid it down . The disintegration process was already at work on it , then . Now that the tree was dead , it was fair game . But it apparently took longer for individual cells to die , so the log had lasted most of the day . With that thought , Darran realized that the sky was growing darker . Boglietti 's world , like everything in the Altair system , had a lot of angular momentum , which meant a short day . He 'd done all he could anyway . It was time to find shelter for the night . Anything that would get him out of this damnable rain , and protect him from predators . He retrieved his club and the faceplate from where he 'd laid them down , but the club snapped in two under its own weight . Useless now . He was back to being naked and defenseless again , unless he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed he could rip off another branch every half hour or so , but that would mean climbing a tree , now that all the downed timber was decomposing . It was getting dark fast . The foliage went from electric green to just plain green , then edged toward black . Darran made a quick foray into the woods and found it even darker in there . He would never find shelter in the few minutes of light left . He had only one real option , the same one his evolutionary forebears had used . He jumped up and wrapped his arms around the trunk of a tree at the edge of the blast zone . He grappled with the rough bark for a second , found a knob he could hold onto , and pulled his legs up until his toes found purchase as well . He looked overhead for another handhold , saw nothing at first , but when he squinted against the rain he saw a zigzag ladder of them leading upward . Thanking providence for small favors , he inched his way up until his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused under the overhang , savoring the respite from the endless rain , but he knew he would fall the moment he relaxed so he reached up with one hand until he got a firm hold on the lip of the ring , then swung himself out and scrambled over the edge . The top surface was hard and flat , and maybe four feet in diameter . The canopy of leaves diverted some of the rain , at least , and the shelf would be big enough to lie down on if he curled around the tree trunk . If he wrapped his arms around his knees he might not even fall off in his sleep , assuming he got any . The sky grew darker until the forest became indistinct , then at some point Darran realized he could n't see his hands in front of his face anymore . He snuggled up against the tree on his left side and rested his head on his arm , covering his right ear with the faceplate to keep the water off . Through the hiss of rain he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and occasionally closer by . Something creaked and groaned out in the clearing , but it was impossible to say what it was . Each new noise sent his pulse skyrocketing until he could breathe deeply and force himself to calm down . It was nothing like this on a starship . There he knew what every sound was ; here everything was a surprise . He waited for the shriek of something getting caught and messily devoured , but it never came . The rain grew colder as the night wore on . After an hour or so of shivering , Darran stood up , bracing himself against the tree trunk , and reached overhead until he felt leaves , then pulled off as many as he could . He piled them in a nest on his platform and snuggled back down into them , pulling them over his bare skin and tucking them around his arms and legs as best he could . He set the faceplate over his eyes this time and settled back down . It felt a little better . The rain did n't hit as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel motion all along his body - rain trickling through the leaves , maybe even bugs crawling across his skin . He felt what was probably the leaves themselves decomposing and sloughing away , and revulsion nearly made him fling everything off , but the warmth and relative shelter was just barely worth it . HE WOKE TO BRIGHT , chartreuse light again . The sky was as cloudy as ever , and the rain still fell like a shower on full blast . It did n't cheer him at all to know that other Darts of the planet were warm and dry Then it registered : so was he . He sat bolt upright , and nearly pitched off his narrow platform . He would have if it had n't sprouted a railing sometime in the night . But that only drew his attention for a second , because he was wearing an even bigger mystery : his spacesuit had come back . Darran unsealed the faceplate and slid it upward , smelled the planet 's thick aroma , then closed it again and breathed until the suit 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no idea where the suit had come from . He had seen it disintegrate right off his body . He looked over the edge of his platform to see if there might be someone from the Pioneer-or maybe a crowd of aliens  --  below , and nearly fell off again when he looked out into the clearing . It was n't there anymore . All the trees had grown back in the night , or other trees had moved in . Or maybe his own tree had uprooted itself and walked away , carrying him with it . Whatever , from his perch about thirty feet up he could see nothing but more treetops in every direction . He had to sit down . This was all too much . His vision grew swirly until he tucked his head between his knees and breathed deeply for a few seconds . He concentrated on the rubbery surface of the platform on which he sat . Just one tiny piece of this immense planet ; that was all he could cope with at the moment . It looked slightly grainy , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd examined yesterday had looked like that , too . And so did his new pressure suit . He reached out with his gloved fingers and scraped at the platform . It did n't yield at first , but after a moment it did , allowing him to draw deep grooves in its surface . The material he dislodged piled up just like sand . When he nudged it , it spread out like sand , too . Had he broken the cellular bonds ? The tree could n't stand if it was that fragile . Besides , it had been tough as nails for a second before it gave way . And in the next few seconds the gritty material solidified again . The parallel grooves he 'd drawn with his fingers froze into place , and the surface became just as hard as before . He dug at it again , making more grooves alongside the first ones . He scraped his fingers through it once more , trying to make some kind of sense of what he was seeing . How could it do that ? Suddenly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had drawn with his fingers shifted . They moved into regular rows and extended themselves into concentric arcs , rippling all the way around the tree trunk to form circles . Darran scrambled to his feet in blind panic . His boots skidded , but the rough surface stopped them before he could lose his balance . " Traction grating , " he said . " It turned into traction grating . " For that was exactly what it had become . He recognized it from countless corridors and access tunnels on the Pioneer . Not the same pattern , but definitely the same idea . " All right , what 's going on here ? " he asked aloud . He did n't normally talk to himself , but he needed the human voice even if it was his own . " I got a new spacesuit , the forest came back , the platform grew a railing , and now it made traction grating . This ca n't be a natural process , no matter how alien this place is . " Which meant it was somehow artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark in his gloved hand ; after a second of resistance it softened and he tore a fist-sized chunk of it loose . He looked closely at it : green , grainy , and malleable , like everything else he 'd seen on the planet . He squished it in his hands , rolled it out into a long cylinder , and looped it around to make a donut . After a second it morphed into a smooth ring and solidified . " Kid 's toy ? Paperweight ? " he asked . He squeezed it into a half dozen other shapes , and each time he paused for more than a few seconds it became something else , all equally unrecognizable . But he was beginning to see a pattern . He molded it back into a ring , slid it over his spacesuit 's left wrist , flattened it out , and sure enough , it became a wristwatch . An alien wristwatch , with a glowing readout that showed symbols vaguely resembling Chinese , and rows of buttons along the sides , but it confirmed his suspicion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttons . The platform on which he stood shuddered , then glided smoothly to the ground . When he pushed on the railing , it parted for him and he stepped out onto the springy forest floor . " They solved the power distribution problem , " he said in wonder . Humanity 's attempts at creating universal nanomachines had run repeatedly into the same barrier : it was impossible to give such tiny machines enough energy to disassemble and reassemble things much faster than a living cell could . The aliens who lived here had evidently figured out how to do it , and they 'd come up with an integrated control system as well . Apparently if you shaped the nanomachines into a rough approximation of what you wanted , they would search for a match within their database of known objects . And when faced with an object they had never seen before , they would disassemble it to make their own template for next time . Either that or they just ate any raw materials they encountered . Leaving biological objects , and anything that looked sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do to eat the people they were supposed to serve , after all . Darran wondered what had finally killed off their masters . Or if maybe they were still around , living quiet lives in the woods and showing no signs of civilization from orbit . Maybe they were watching him after all , wondering whether he was intelligent enough to figure out how to solve his problem . That was the question , was n't it ? Well , for the first time since he 'd landed on this living nightmare of a planet , Darran thought he had the answer . If he was right , he could get offworld again . He would have to spend time quarantined in a free-floating pressure bubble until they could make sure no nanomachines accompanied him into the Pioneer , but he would n't mind . As long as it did n't rain in the bubble , he could stay there forever if need be . But first he had to find the spot where the control cabin had been absorbed .... IT TOOK A FEW hours , since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he eventually came to a depression in the ground with a few plastic fittings scattered within it . Hose couplings , push buttons , all useless now except for one thing . He bent down and began scooping moss and ferns into a pile at his feet . He took his time , heaping up a mound as big as he could manage . It morphed into a dome at one point , complete with a padded bench and a table inside , and Darran nearly quit his work to go sit down out of the rain , but he knew he was close now so he kept digging and piling . After a few more pounds of mass he got something that looked a little like a teepee . Apparently a man piling up things in the rain looked like he needed shelter more than anything else . He kept scooping debris up against it , and eventually it became a simple heap of working mass again . At last when he felt he had approximated the shape of the lander , he reached in through the yielding surface and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could guess to where they belonged . Then he stood back and watched as the surface writhed , expanded , and solidified into a sleek , narrow-bodied , stubby-winged spaceplane that looked like it was doing about ten percent of lightspeed just standing there . " No , dammit , I want the lander , " he said aloud . He was about to start pushing and prodding again when he realized the flaw in his plan . The nanocreatures did n't know what the whole thing looked like . The engine section had blown up before they could make a template of it . But they had done the best they could to provide him with what he asked for . He took a closer look at the spaceplane , and smiled for the first time since he 'd arrived . It did look like it would fly , if he could just figure out the controls . Fortunately it was already pointed upward . He searched for a hatch , found it between the wings , and popped it open with the recessed handle . The inside of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead ; after a moment he realized he was supposed to stand up in it . When he did , and closed the hatch behind him , he discovered that his arms would fit into sleeves that extended into the wings . They were n't designed for humans - the arm holes were about ribcage high-but when he slowly stood up and exerted pressure on the sleeves , the holes moved upward to accommodate him . There were n't any control buttons . Just pedals under his feet and toggles at the ends of his fingers . It would n't take much experimentation to figure out what they did . Head first into the unknown . He grinned outright at the thought . This did n't scare him nearly as much as all the living stuff just outside . He was used to spaceships . " Let 's do it , " he said . He flexed his toes and wiggled his fingers , and with a roar of power loud enough to drown out a whole planetful of rain , the spaceplane leaped into the sky . He leaned left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mimicked his movements in all three dimensions . He felt like a superhero , like a god , and at that moment he understood where the aliens had all gone . With this kind of freedom , they had gone everywhere .
