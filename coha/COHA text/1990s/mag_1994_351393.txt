She was a last link to a certain kind of past , and that is part , but only part , of why we mourn so . Jackie Kennedy symbolized  --  she was a connection to a time , to an old America that was more dignified , more private , an America in which standards were higher and clearer and elegance meant something , a time when elegance was a kind of statement , a way of dressing up the world , and so a generous act . She had manners , the kind that remind us that manners spring from a certain moral view  --  that you do tribute to the world and the people in it by being kind and showing respect , by sending the note and the flowers , by being loyal , and cheering a friend . She was a living reminder in the age of Oprah that personal dignity is always , still , an option , a choice that is open to you . She was , really , the last aristocrat . Few people get to symbolize a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we know it and mourn that too . <P> Those who knew her or watched her from afar groped for the words that could explain their feeling of loss . A friend of hers said , with a soft , sad voice , that what we 're losing is what we long for : the old idea of being cultivated . " She had this complex , colorful mind , she loved a turn of phrase . She did n't grow up in front of the TV set , but reading the classics and thinking about them and having thoughts about history . Oh , " he said , " we 're losing her kind . " <P> I echoed the sentiment to another of her friends , who cut me off . " She was n't a kind , she was sui generis . " And so she was . <P> America continues in its generational shift ; the great ones of the ' 50s and ' 60s , big people of a big era , are going , and too often these days we 're saying goodbye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambivalence clouds her departure , and that leaves us feeling lonely . America this week is a lonelier place . <P> SHE WAS TOO YOUNG , DESERVED MORE TIME , AND THE FACT THAT SHE DID N'T GET IT seems like a new level of unfairness . She never saw her husband grow old , and now she wo n't see her grandchildren grow up . <P> But just writing those words makes me want to break out of sadness and reach back in time and speak ' 60s-speak , or at least how the ' 60s spoke before they turned dark . So I guess I mean I want to speak Kennedyese . I want to say , Aw listen , kid , do n't be glum . What a life she had . <P> She herself said something like this to a friend , in a conversation just months ago , when she first knew she was sick . She told him she was optimistic and hoped to live 20 more years . " But even if I have only five years , so what , I 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life of glamour , but it was really a life of splendor . I want to say , Listen , kid , buck up , do n't be blue  --  the thing about this woman and her life is that she was a patriot , who all by herself one terrible weekend lifted and braced the heart of a nation .
