WHILE THE BULL MARKET WAS ROARING ALONG , MUTUAL FUND SHAREHOLDERS could afford to be the investing world 's equivalent of $100 tippers . When the average equity fund was returning 13.8% a year , as it did between 1988 and 1993 , how many really cared whether they paid their fund an annual fee of 0.5% or 2.5%  --  or even more  --  to defray administrative costs ? Well , even if you did n't mind before , you should now . Last year 's grim markets ( see the table on page 73 ) resoundingly signaled the end of easy money . ( Table omitted ) If , as many forecasters anticipate , stocks and bonds settle back to their respective long-term average gains of seven and two percentage points above the rate of inflation over the next few years , every point you pay in annual fund fees will consume between 14% and 50% of your real return . Unless you 're content to let that portion of your potential profit slide into your fund manager 's pocket , you will need to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MONEY undertook its most extensive study ever of how mutual fund companies make money off investors like you . We interviewed more than 50 fund executives , government officials , academics and other experts , examined dozens of fund documents and commissioned exclusive studies of fund expenses . What we have learned is not likely to endear your fund sponsor to you . Among our findings : * You pay nearly twice as much as institutional investors for money management . And that calculation does n't even include any front-or back-end sales charges you may also pony up . * The seemingly negligible annual fees that funds charge do far more damage to your return than previously imagined . According to new studies conducted separately by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Princeton University , investors lose roughly two percentage points in return for every one percentage point they pay in annual expenses . * U.S. diversified stock funds have jacked up their annual fees nearly 35% over the past 16 years . ( This comparison excludes funds with newfangled commission arrangements , which tend to produce even higher annual expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to about 4.25% in that time , but the steep increase in annual fees occurred even as total fund assets grew 32-fold to $1.6 trillion and the number of fund companies competing for assets more than doubled to 357 . Normally , such an increase in competition would bring lower , not higher , prices . * The investment management fee is only the most obvious of several ways fund sponsors siphon money from shareholders ' assets . Some sponsors have set up subsidiaries to provide certain shareholder services to the fund  --  at a profit , of course . Others use so-called 12b-1 distribution fees to bill shareholders for the fund 's marketing costs , in effect forcing current shareholders to pay to recruit more customers . * Some fund expenses raise questions about conflicts of interest . American Heritage , for instance , paid more than $400,000 in brokerage fees to an owner of the fund 's management company . One obvious fact emerges : It is far more lucrative to own a mutual fund company than to invest in the company 's products . The $295 billion privately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raked in roughly $360 million in fees in fiscal 1994 from just one of its 215 funds , $35 billion Magellan . That 's almost $1 million a day . Publicly traded Franklin Resources , manager of the $114 billion Franklin Templeton family of funds , earned $251 million on $827 million of fees in fiscal 1994 , for a mouth-watering profit margin of 30% . Industrywide , pretax margins typically range from 20% to 50% , according to the Manhattan Beach , Calif. investment banking firm Putnam Lovell . But the industry 's lush profits did not prevent more than 450 funds from going to shareholders to request fee increases over the past three years . Shareholders sign on even when profit margins are already high . Tri-Continental Corp. , a closed-end stock fund with $2.1 billion in assets , asked its holders for a 31% raise in 1991 , even though in 1990 , the most recent year for which figures are available , the fund 's profit margin was 84% . According to numbers in the proxy statement , the fee hike would boost the margin to 88% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convertible Income Growth fund posted after-tax profits of 37% in 1993 ; in ' 94 , it petitioned shareholders for a 17% raise . Did shareholders agree ? You bet . No one denies that mutual fund sponsors deserve fair compensation . It 's clear , though , that fund fees would be far lower if investors cared as much about costs as they do about performance . No sponsor can increase fees without first getting shareholder approval in a proxy vote . The " overwhelming majority " of fee hikes are approved nevertheless , according to Geoff Bobroff , a fund consultant in East Greenwich , R.I. " It appears that shareholders do n't have a clue as to how important expenses are , " says Susan Woodward , the SEC 's chief economist . We intend , at the very least , to make sure MONEY readers do . Make no mistake : Because they provide broad diversification for small investment sums , mutual funds remain , generally , an excellent choice for individuals . But it 's crucial to understand what you 're buying and exactly what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , keep the following points in mind : Annual fees sap your long-term returns , even more than one-time sales charges . Because they are often levied in a lump sum of 4% or so when you invest , up-front sales loads are the most obvious of the costs fund shareholders bear . But they do n't make fund companies rich . In fact , most fund companies keep very little of the load : Virtually all the money is divided between the broker who sold the fund and the broker 's firm . Far more important , both to fund companies and to long-term investors , are the seemingly minor slices deducted from your holdings year after year . They include management and shareholder servicing fees . ( See the chart on page 134 . ) ( Chart omitted ) On the average domestic-stock fund , these total 1.36% of assets ( a figure known as the expense ratio ) . The average taxable bond fund 's expense ratio is about 0.9% ; the average tax-exempt fund 's , about 0.8% ; and for money-market funds , the cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the expense ratio creates a drag on your performance that , over long periods , can dwarf the effect of a sales charge . A fund with a 4% load will underperform a no-load fund with an identical portfolio ( and equal annual expenses ) by 4% after day one and by the same amount after 20 years . But because of compounding , the penalty imposed by a higher annual expense ratio builds year after year . In theory , a portfolio that returns 7% before levying expenses of 1% a year will outgain a hypothetical twin with a 2% expense ratio by 4.9% after five years . The performance gap will grow to 9.9% by year 10 and to 20.9% by year 20 . In the real world , though , high-expense funds have tended to underperform lower-cost funds by an even greater margin than theory would suggest . At MONEY 's request the Chicago investment research firm Morningstar analyzed U.S. diversified equity fund returns for the past decade and found that those with an expense ratio below the industry 's 1.36% norm returned 13.1% annually for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above-average expenses returned just 11.1% ( see the chart on page 130 ) . ( Chart omitted ) The two groups ' average expense ratios were 0.97% and 2.17%  --  which means the pricier group 's expense handicap explains only 60% of the full two-point annual performance gap . New academic studies  --  one by the SEC and the other by Princeton University economics professor Burton Malkiel  --  shed light on why this is so . Their research , which together covers the years from 1971 to 1993 , showed that for every percentage point a typical equity fund spent on expenses , its return dropped by 1.9 points . When the SEC factored out differences caused by investment style and risk level , returns dropped by an average 3.3 points for every point in expenses . Part of the reason , according to the studies , is that funds with high expenses also tend to have high turnover , presumably to juice returns . But any value their frequent trading added was more than offset by the greater accumulation of transaction costs . A 1994 academic report found that high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extra money a fund spends on investment management should allow it to beat an unmanaged index of bonds . But New York University professors Martin Gruber and Edwin Elton and Fordham University assistant professor Christopher Blake found that for every percentage point a bond fund spends on fees , investors get back only two-tenths of a point in improved performance . " You 're losing 0.8 percentage points a year for every point you spend , " says Gruber , who is also chairman of the finance department of NYU 's Stern School of Business . " Investment managers do n't earn nearly enough to cover the fees they charge . " Fund shareholders overpay ... Bond fund investors pay an average of 0.65% in fees for investment management , according to the Boston financial research firm Dalbar Inc . ( Remember that the expense ratios cited above for bond funds include all annual expenses , not just those for investment management . ) That 's more than twice the 0.3% that pension funds and other institutions pay for fixed-income portfolio management , according to Greenwich Associates , a research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on page 137 ) . ( Chart omitted ) Although the average institutional fund is larger than the typical retail bond fund  --  $412 million vs. $275 million in assets  --  experts say the institutional funds ' slightly more cost-efficient size does n't begin to explain the gulf in fees . Rodger Smith , a Greenwich Associates partner , says : " I would n't have been surprised if the average fee for bond funds was 0.35% or 0.40% , " he says , " but these are really high numbers . I think the fact that institutions have more bargaining power is certainly one factor . " Fund executives counter that retail investors get more services than institutions . " Fund management fees typically include fees not only for investment advice but for a host of administrative services , " says Matt Fink , president of the Investment Company Institute , the fund industry 's trade group . Among others , he named daily pricing , fund literature and state registration fees . But other experts deny that such services account for the whole difference . " No more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than management , " says Dalbar president Louis Harvey . Besides , institutions also demand costly services , such as personal visits from fund managers and customized financial reports . ... and expense ratios still keep going up . It may at first seem normal that fund fees should get higher over time . After all , inflation drives up most consumer prices . Remember , however , that funds assess fees as a percentage of assets . So had they not changed expense ratios at all , fund managers as a whole would have received a 535% raise in the past decade simply from the fund industry 's asset growth . ( Inflation over the same period raised consumer prices 42% . ) Thus by increasing expense ratios as well , funds are snatching a larger slice of a growing pie . The chart above shows how much greater the fund sponsors ' slice has become in the past 16 years . ( Chart omitted ) After adjusting for developments that might have artificially inflated expense ratios , like the introduction of 12b-1 distribution charges in 1980 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 0.69% to 0.93% . For taxable bond funds , expenses climbed from 0.7% to 0.8% and peaked at 0.86% in 1990 . The one exception is municipal bond funds , whose average expenses sank from 0.71% to 0.63% . That may be because muni bond funds were relatively rare in 1979 and thus could command higher prices . ( Today , Morningstar tracks more than 1,500 of them . ) But even muni prices have begun creeping upward , from a low of 0.61% in 1992 . " What 's striking to me is the direction fees are moving , " says Charles Trzcinka , a professor of finance at the State University of New York at Buffalo . " We have this supposedly highly competitive mutual fund industry that keeps on raising prices . " Some fund executives reply that they 've had to raise fees to improve services . Amenities such as automated telephone lines , shareholder newsletters and advanced computers have made the business more expensive since 1979 . " You 're comparing a Model T with a new car that has roll-up windows and air bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a point-up to a point . But such arguments would be more persuasive if fund assets had not ballooned from $49 billion to $1.6 trillion over the period . As funds grow , sponsors are able to spread fixed costs over a larger pool of money . That should have made fund expense ratios decline , even after installing fancy phone equipment and the like . " The economies of scale in investment management are staggering , " explains John Bogle , chairman of the $132 billion Vanguard Group of funds and a longtime , if hardly disinterested , crusader for bargain-level fund fees ( Vanguard 's fees are among the lowest in the business ) . " It need not cost anything more to manage $10 billion than to manage $500 million . " A confidential document provided to MONEY by the Vanguard Group shows how the arithmetic works . In 1993 , Vanguard spent $235 million on telephones , computers , shareholder mailings and other operating expenses , nearly 10 times what it spent a decade earlier . But the rise in costs shrivels in comparison to Vanguard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion to $109 billion . As a result , operating costs as a percentage of fund assets actually decreased 40% to 0.22% . Because the Vanguard Group provides its services to shareholders at cost . Vanguard investors saw their average expenses cut by more than half to 0.3% . Nor was ultra-frugal Vanguard alone in finding a way to trim expense ratios : so did $25 billion USAA Investment Management Co. , $8.3 billion Mutual Series and Franklin . ( See the table on page 138 . ) ( Table omitted ) But not every family feels compelled to pass on the economies of scale . When AIM Value nearly doubled its assets to $1.36 billion in 1994 ( vs. $763 million in 1993 ) , shareholders were asked to approve a fee increase that boosted the fund 's expense ratio from 0.9% to 1.14% . When asked why , AIM spokesman Clara Caldwell said , " There are additional costs to do research . Those costs have to be accounted for . " Evidently , shareholders bought this , since they approved the request . Before every request for higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fund 's directors . The fee is supposed to be the product of arms-length negotiations between the fund sponsor or investment adviser and its board of directors , who are elected by shareholders and theoretically serve as their voice in governing the fund . ( For a revealing look at the strengths and weaknesses of this system , see " How Fund Directors Are Letting You Down , " in the September 1993 issue of MONEY . ) Fee negotiations are not always a contest of equals . However , in 1993 , directors of $87 million American Heritage asked shareholders to approve a pay package that would raise the annual management fee by two-thirds to 1.25% and authorize the fund ( that is , the shareholders ) to pick up $40,000 in office rent previously paid by management . In the proxy statement sent to shareholders , the directors explained that American Heritage Management Co. , the fund 's investment adviser , had threatened that without the increase it " could not assure the Board . it would continue to serve as the Fund 's investment advisor ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management 's bluff and let them take a hike . After racking up compelling 49% average annual gains from 1991 to 1993 , American Heritage crashed in ' 94 , losing 35.3% ( vs. a loss of 1.2% for its average competitor ) . Because shareholders went along with the 1993 fee hike , 1994 's losses were steepened by an expense ratio of 2.41% , nearly a third higher than the 1.84% of assets paid by the average aggressive growth fund . " For a rather prolonged period the directors and Heiko fund manager Heiko Thieme subsidized the fund to give it good viability , " explains Eugene Sarver , a fund director and a professor of finance at New York City 's Pace University . ( The sponsor picked up expenses when the expense ratio topped 0.75% , and three directors voluntarily went without pay . ) " The increase in fees was very tiny compared with the capital gains we gave our shareholders . " Often , fund managements just fee hikes by showing fund directors studies comparing their funds ' expenses to those of competitors . Mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select expensive funds for the comparison group , a process that can make a fee hike seem more reasonable . " I 'm not saying anyone is cooking the books , but occasionally the data is prepared to make it easier to get the increase . " MONEY has learned that in 1993 , shareholders of $3.2 billion American Capital Government Securities were asked to accept a fee schedule that would give management an 8.7% raise , worth an extra $1.5 million . In the fund 's pro statement , the board noted that the fund 's total expenses " were well below the median fee rates and expense ratios of a group of similar funds ... selected by the mutual fund analysis firm Lipper Analytical Services . " The group that Lipper selected , according to a chart provided by Lipper to MONEY , consisted of 14 government bond funds with the same objective as the American Capital entry . MONEY believes that contrary to management 's claim , the group of 14 funds that Lipper selected was not truly comparable with the American Capital fund because many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included six with 12b-1 distribution fees that inflated their expense ratios by 0.75% or more  --  vs . American Capital 's 0.25% 12b-1 . Had the directors compared apples to apples , American Capital 's original fees would have seemed no different from , or even slightly higher than , those of the control group . An American Capital spokesperson says the comparison group was set by Lipper . A. Michael Lipper , president of Lipper Analytical , says that his firm picked funds that were as close as possible in size and investment objective , and that directors were also provided with an additional comparison that looked at the same group of funds without 12b-1 fees . Says Lipper : " You would think that with all the funds out there we should be able to find a nice neat comparison , but you 're always going to come up with some that fit , but not exactly . " Even when fee comparisons such as these are absolutely airtight , however , the assumption that underlies them is a marvel of circular logic . If fund sponsors feel entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average , the industry 's fees can only go up . Every fee increase , after all , slightly elevates the industry average , which , in turn , creates a new cadre of fund sponsors with below-average expenses . You 're helping to pay the fund 's marketing costs ... Competition from no-loads helped shrink sales loads dramatically over the past decade  --  one of the few fund arenas in which market forces succeeded in lowering shareholders ' prices . Ten years ago many funds charged an 8% load ; today , few charge more than 4% . But while front-end loads have fallen , the benefit to shareholders has been eroded by the rise of 12b-1 fees , an annual distribution charge that can range from 0.15% to 1 of assets . Before the SEC approved rule 12b-1 a decade and a half ago , distribution costs were considered the fund sponsor 's responsibility ; after all , the benefits of bringing in more fund assets accrue mainly to the fund 's management , which pulls in more fee revenue . Nevertheless , 87% of broker-sold funds nowadays carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers for commissions paid to brokers . Nearly 30% of directly marketed funds also assess these charges , mainly to help pay for the cost of advertising . Sponsors claim that 12b-1s benefit investors by helping boost the fund 's size , allowing funds to pass on economies of scale . But a study by SUNY-Buffalo 's Charles Trzcinka found that funds with 12b-1s had higher expense ratios and lower returns than funds that did n't . " It 's clear that the real and large benefit from 12b-1 inures to the fund 's adviser , " concludes Tamar Frankel , a professor of law at Boston University . " Shareholders benefit to the extent that they rejoice in the adviser 's good fortune . " ... and you 'll soon be paying more . As the number of funds competing for investors ' dollars proliferates , brokerages and banks that have access to those investors are demanding a bigger piece of the action . Ohio 's Banc One , for instance , has asked fund companies either to pay more than the standard annual service fee of 0.25% or provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started its One Source fund network in 1992 , it charged fund families 0.25% of the assets it placed in the family . Now some groups pay as much as 0.35% . And Fidelity pays the banks and brokerage firms that distribute the stock funds in its Advisor series 0.5% . " Higher distribution costs will be passed on to investors , " says Dalbar president Louis Harvey . Fund companies nick you for services besides investment advice . Portfolio management is n't the only service that fund investors pay for . On a $10,000 investment , you spend an average of about $19 a year on the fund 's transfer agent , which is the outfit that handles investor questions , tracks shareholders ' accounts , mails dividend checks and so on . Another $8.30 goes to the fund 's custodian bank , which holds the fund 's securities and cash for safekeeping , and to other expenses such as printing and legal costs . On top of that , you pay about $12 a year to brokerages , your share of the commissions on the fund 's trades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominated by specialized firms such as State Street Bank in Boston and Kansas City 's DST Inc . But increasingly fund management companies are performing these activities themselves  --  and pocketing the fees . Fidelity , for instance , operates its own distribution company and transfer agent and even does accounting for its funds . That allows the firm to keep more than 85c of every dollar in fees collected from Magellan shareholders . Franklin collects about $55 million from its affiliated transfer agent . Granted , when fund sponsors bring jobs like transfer agency in-house , the quality of service often improves . But so does the sponsor 's bottom line . " A lot of fund sponsors and investment advisers try to structure it with a pretax profit margin of 10% to 15% , though there may be some that are higher , " says Coopers &; Lybrand partner Robert Uek . More worrisome , a management company with its own shareholder servicing subsidiary has little incentive to strike a good deal for shareholders . " When a fund uses affiliates to perform services , it may be less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessive fees , " Richard Roberts , an SEC commissioner , told the Massachusetts Bar Association last year . The management company stands to make still more money if it is affiliated with a brokerage firm . Fidelity Brokerage Services , an arm of the fund giant , collects roughly $50 million in brokerage commissions from a dozen of Fidelity 's largest equity funds . Prudential Equity fund pays $351,000 , or 22% of its total commissions , to Prudential Securities . In a few cases , these dealings raise questions about conflicts of interest . Roughly 36% of American Heritage 's trades were handled by Bear Stearns , which collected roughly $1.1 million in commissions from American Heritage in fiscal ' 94 . Of that sum , $430,000 was paid to Richard Parker , a Bear Steams managing director who owns a 10% stake in American Heritage Management Corp. , the fund 's investment manager . " I abstain from discussions about who gets the brokerage business , " says Parker , adding that " Bear Stearns gives us by far the best service . " Says American Heritage 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the management company : " The reason I deal with Bear Stearns is because we get the best execution of our trades . If my partner makes money , bully for him . " What investors and regulators can do to control fund expenses . While the SEC should not get into the business of telling mutual funds how much they can charge , the commission should require funds to be more forthcoming about the costs of investing . It has already taken one step : Beginning in October , fund companies that ask for a fee increase have had to reveal in the fund 's proxy statement how much the higher expenses will cost the average investor over a one- , three- , five-and 10-year period . The rule applies not only to management fees but to changes in other costs , like the adoption of 12b-1 fees or a decision to have investors pay for the manager 's office rent . The SEC could do more . A useful first step would be to lean on fund companies to simplify often impenetrable proxy statements . " The cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a fee increase , " says Vanguard 's Bogle . " Inside they should clearly tell you what they want to spend the money on . " For fund shareholders , the key to managing costs is vigilance and education . Before you invest , acquaint yourself with all the fund 's expenses , which are summarized in a table on the first few pages of every prospectus . Avoid funds with high expenses , regardless of how strong their recent performance may be . That means swearing off stock funds with average annual fees of 1.50% or more , taxable bond funds with costs greater than 1% and tax-exempt funds with charges exceeding 0.75% . ( Because international funds face higher administrative costs , you can raise your hurdle for them to 2% . ) Or for absolute certainty that you 're not overpaying for the privilege of investing in a fund , stick with the low-cost fund groups  --  both load and no-load  --  shown in the table on page 138 . ( Table omitted ) When a fund sends you a proxy , do n't think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine if the fund group is asking for higher fees . If so , the rest of your job is simple . Just say no . <p>
