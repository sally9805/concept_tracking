<p> MAKING HER NEW YORK debut in 1979 , Darci Kistler was unmistakably that rare thing , a born ballerina . Just 15 , she was adorable , with doll features , a bold , maidenly air and what one critic called " her honey amber hair of remarkable texture . " But it was her assured and joyful mastery of the classical idiom , even in a student performance , that won her the admiration of audiences and critics and the support of George Balanchine , the New York City Ballet 's ballet master in chief . Balanchine chose her from his company 's academy , the School of American Ballet , made her a company member at 16 , worked closely with her and cast her in great roles . <p> To many people , the California-born Ms. Kistler is " a forever young figure , eternally 16 , " as Robert La Fosse , her fellow principal dancer and frequent partner onstage , said recently . But time has passed . The carefree young star , who seemed insulated by privilege and mystique , suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth with aplomb . <p> Kevin McKenzie , the director of American Ballet Theater , remembers his initial delight in Ms. Kistler 's " wonderfully warm , inviting presence . " But seeing her in a recent City Ballet commission , Ulysses Dove 's propulsive " Red Angels , " he was struck for the first time by her " feminine power , " he says . <p> Like every City Ballet dancer 's , Ms. Kistler 's career was short-circuited and her spirit affected by Balanchine 's death in 1983 . Since then , she has suffered so many physical setbacks that The New York Times once published the news that she was " dancing injury-free for the first time in five years . " The latest setback was earlier this year : just before City Ballet 's winter season ended in February , a herniated disk sent her to the sidelines . Still , when the company 's spring season opens on Thursday , she will be ready to try again . <p> " I have started over so many times , " she said recently . Yet she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brought up to do 100 percent , " she explained . " That 's what Mr. B. asked . " <p> And when asked what characterizes the roles choreographed for her by Jerome Robbins and others , she was able to answer thoughtfully , " A lightheartedness . " <p> Ms. Kistler , now 32 , remains touchingly youthful , though she has been a principal dancer for 15 years , is on the faculty at the School of American Ballet and is a wife and mother . She and Balanchine 's beleaguered successor , Peter Martins , 50 , were married in 1991 . The marriage , which began with an elopement , has been remarkably private save for a much publicized episode in 1992 , when Ms. Kistler had her husband arrested for assault , then dropped the charges . " Things are peaceful at home now , " she said recently . " I do n't want people to worry . " The couple 's daughter , Talicia , was born last June . <p> Ms. Kistler returned to the stage six months after the birth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 10th Avenue " at the gala that opened the winter season . She appeared to be in great shape . But her new schedule as a working mother  --  family life , teaching , taking classes , rehearsing , performing  --  entailed extensive physical therapy . <p> One typical morning earlier this year , she was making this demanding schedule look easy . Having danced " Vienna Waltzes " the night before and having been up early with the baby , she was teaching a class of 12-year-old girls at the school . Her famous hair was loose , swept back by a leopard-print bandeau and falling past her waist . At one moment , she was perched on a stool , her bearing alert and regal , knees together , glamorous pointes stabbed into the floor . At the next , she darted out on point to show the girls how to spring into sous-sous , a tight fifth position on half-toe . " Like a kitty cat ! " Ms. Kistler cried in her light voice . The children tried again . " Beautiful , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep joy to Ms. Kistler , but she makes the transition to motherhood sound suspiciously easy . " How did I stay in shape ? " she said . " I did what I liked every day : I took class . I stopped for two months before , and I started back six weeks after I had the little girl . " <p> Then she collided with reality . " I 've had a lot of injuries , none of which I 'm proud of , " she said in late January , looking a little worn . She explained that her most recent difficulties began with a minor car accident she had in December 1994 . The obvious injury was to her hip ; she took six weeks off and had physical therapy . For the next year and a half , she danced on , periodically sidelined by hip and back problems , then she went on maternity leave . <p> After returning to work , she experienced problems that led to the diagnosis of a herniated disk . " I had stopped trying to pick up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her exalted Balanchine repertory  --  the Second Movement of " Symphony in C , " Terpsichore in " Apollo , " " Mozartiana "  --  before she twisted a foot accommodating the back injury and bowed out of the season . She then conducted School of American Ballet auditions on the West Coast . <p> Back in New York early this month , Ms. Kistler was clearly on the mend . She was radiant , wearing high-heeled , candy-apple-red boots and a bright flowered dress . While her daughter piloted a walker around their apartment , a fourth-floor West Side walk-up ( the family also has a house in Connecticut ) , the ballerina whisked about preparing for the family 's move to a place four blocks closer to the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center , where the company works . <p> HOPING TO DANCE MR . MARTINS 'S 1991 version of " The Sleeping Beauty , " which opens the spring season , Ms. Kistler vowed : " I 'm going to take it a little slower and get back completely . I have a month now just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her boss slightly complicates the matter . With a naughty laugh , Ms. Kistler admitted that to keep Mr. Martins from grounding her when she knows she is overtaxed , " I will lie to him . " <p> From his vantage point as a company member , Mr. La Fosse looks at the big picture . " Peter is very diplomatic , " he said . " He tries to keep all of his ballerinas on the stage , but of course , he has a favorite and that 's Darci . " <p> Managing her fame and physical resources is something that Ms. Kistler has been trying to master for years . She was a sensation in that 1979 debut , dancing a Bournonville piece staged by her teacher Stanley Williams in the School of American Ballet workshops . And when she joined City Ballet , all eyes were on her . Within months , Jennifer Dunning wrote in The New York Times , " Everybody , it seems . . . loves Darci Kistler . " By 17 , she was famous , touted in People , Vogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . <p> She was also , as her childhood friend Teresa Reyes , a City Ballet corps member , says , " the audience 's darling . " The critic Mindy Aloff described the Kistler faction , " knotted around the weekly casting sheets in the lobby " of the State Theater , running " their index fingers approvingly under the lines bearing her name . " <p> In 1983 , after Balanchine was hospitalized , Ms. Kistler broke an ankle . He died having never made a work for her . Many dance writers had predicted she would be his next muse , succeeding Suzanne Farrell . But the Farrell legacy , like Ms. Kistler 's facility , proved a mixed blessing . <p> When she finally returned to the stage two years later , she was " rapturously received , " as the critic Clive Barnes wrote , " by a packed house , which gave her a most unusual nine-curtain-call ovation . " Still feeling the aftershock of Balanchine 's death , the public feverishly reclaimed his chosen spirit ; instead of shouting " Brava ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darci ! " <p> Paul Kolnik , one of Ms. Kistler 's longtime friends and the company 's photographer , recalls those fans as " the children of paradise crowd , " referring to the classic Marcel Carne film and the French nickname for people who buy the least expensive seats and sit closest to the gods . But by the time the typed casting sheets taped up in the lobby were replaced by pristine printouts in a glass vitrine three years ago , the children of paradise had long since dispersed . " The audience is changed , " Ms. Kistler said . " I do n't know what happened . " <p> Certainly her husband 's management of the Balanchine legacy and his development of repertory and dancers had alienated many City Ballet loyalists . He could n't win , of course . " Because Peter is not Mr. B. , " said Mr. Kolnik , " no one can forgive him . " <p> The company 's Balanchine Celebration in 1993 seemed designed to draw the faithful back . And Ms. Kistler was cast in 22 roles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans  --  one reporter spotted the slogan " Darci Kistler Rules " painted on a wall downtown  --  many critics used the occasion to savage Mr. Martins 's regime . <p> " Our audience has grown , " Ms. Kistler said . " Bigger is better . But intimate and knowledgeable is something we do n't want to lose . " <p> Mr. Martins did take steps to insure continuity onstage . Anne Belle 's 1989 documentary film , " Dancing for Mr. B , " shows Ms. Kistler learning the title role in " La Sonnambula " from one of its great interpreters , the former City Ballet star Allegra Kent . The role was created in 1946 for Alexandra Danilova , who taught Ms. Kistler at the School of American Ballet . <p> " Dancing most of our rep , " Ms. Kistler said recently , " you always feel you 've worked ; in ' Sonnambula ' you are tired in other ways , " fatigued by the subdued drama and by repressed impulses to move . <p> Suppressing the impulse to dance with abandon is painful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , " she said , " and then all of a sudden it was so difficult . I was n't able to work freely . I 've decided it 's almost easier to have dance be a little difficult for you because then you have to be consistent ; you do n't push too far . You learn limits because you hit barriers . " <p> SOME DIFFICULTIES IN HER career have been easily dispatched . Learning the Farrell role in " Vienna Waltzes , " she was told to use her imagination where Ms. Farrell had improvised . Ms. Kistler said : " Fine . But I still need to know what the original did on what count . " Working with Ms. Farrell , who had been the company 's de facto prima ballerina until her retirement in 1989 , in preparation for the Balanchine Celebration was another matter . Ms. Farrell undertook to teach one of the most idiosyncratic roles Balanchine made for her , the lead in the exotic Ravel miniature " Tzigane , " to Ms. Kistler . <p> In this case , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon for Suzanne to give over that role , in her theater , " said Ms. Kistler , who began to feel that everything about herself " was wrong , down to the color of my tights , and we all have the same color tights  --  pink . " ( A month after the Balanchine Celebration , Ms. Farrell , who had been working in strained circumstances , was dismissed by City Ballet . She did not return calls for this article . ) <p> Ms. Kistler stepped into another great Farrell vehicle , " Mozartiana , " with assurance . " Mr. Balanchine told me that to try to dance like another dancer is death , " Ms. Kistler said . " Suzanne and I are totally different . She 's dark ; she 's very mysterious . I do n't have an approach to ' Mozartiana . ' I just quietly start the ballet , and the ballet picks up from there . I 'm actually learning while I 'm dancing . " <p> Performing the work in February , she was flanked in the first-movement prayer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School of American Ballet , former students of hers . " My first generation , " she said with a smile . As their teacher , she said , she has sought to " make it easier for them , give them the care " that might spare them what she has endured . <p> And how does she understand the ceremony of the Preghiera ? " I feel that you make it your own prayer , " she said . Told that she seems confident God hears her , she looks surprised . " Oh , " she said . " You are promised that He hears you . "
