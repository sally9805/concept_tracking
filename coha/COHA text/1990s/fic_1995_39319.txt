Twice this summer rabid raccoons have crawled down people 's chimneys and in both cases bit old women , in both cases on the fact . This is the reason that A. has brought her cat , B. , to the veterinarian . <p> The waiting room is crowded , but A. ca n't tell how many pet owners have brought in their pets for rabies boosters . For one thing , no one mentions the article that appeared yesterday in the local paper and that focused  --  wrongly , it seems to A.  --  on the second raccoon attack , when the real news , it seems to her , is that the same thing happened twice , though this fact was only mentioned once in the last paragraph of the article . <p> Also , many pets in the waiting room seem to have something seriously wrong with them , or rather many pet owners seem to believe that they do . The office is very crowded , and during the long wait A. sees a woman announce to the whole waiting room that her dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , calls the dog 's name , the dog turns its head and barks . A. also sees a man tell the receptionist that his cat is blind even as the cat paws with cruel accuracy at a ladybug on the counter . <p> So even here at the veterinarian 's , things are not what they seem , even here where it should be so simple : pet lovers and loving pets . Partly what 's caused the long delay was the young couple , much too young to own the old cat that  --  you could see on their faces  --  was dying . The receptionist took them first , ahead of everyone waiting , all of whom understood at once that this too was an act of mercy . It strikes A. that this must be regular procedure at this office , which tips her feelings briefly on the side of veterinarian , Dr. C. , whom on the one hand she admires for how good he is with B. , even though she knows he will not give B. a rabies shot without insisting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while A. looks on in a panic at how much this is going to cost . <p> The couple returns  --  without their cat . The receptionist says , " No charge " The couple is weeping , both of them  --  but you can not tell . Just as , watching A. stroke B. 's orange fur , you could not possibly tell that this pet owner and her pet have been having a little trouble . In the past weeks , B. has smashed A. 's favorite vase , shit on her best black dress , killed a squirrel  --  a squirrel !  --  and left its headless body at the foot of A. 's bed . A. removed the corpse with a shovel . The rabies shot is a must ! <p> For years B. has been a good cat , affectionate , even loyal . A. knows it is stupid to imagine an animal capable of something like human malice . One thing animals teach you is to accept things for what they are , and anyone can see that B. is simply being catlike . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed at a photograph in a supermarket-tabloid article about a woman whose sweet white kitty began to resemble Hitler : the diagonal shock of dark hair , the little black brush mustache . And finally it is paranoid to imagine that the trouble A. is having with her cat is in any way related to the trouble she is having with people  --  specifically , with her boyfriend , D. Your warm understanding with your pet is supposed to remain constant , comforting and sustaining you throughout your misunderstandings with people . Your pet , A. thinks , should n't turn on you when it sees that you are wounded , though of course A. has to wonder if that is animal nature , too . <p> Eventually A. is the last one left in the waiting room , though others  --  and not just the owners of the cat who was put away  --  came in after her . Once they 're alone , the receptionist compliments A. on what a smart thing she is doing , how few people watch out , really watch out , for their pets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new ambivalence about B. , or maybe if she did she would say it does n't matter , what absolves A. is that she is here , getting B. a rabies booster , when most people do n't even know that they and their pet need not actually be bitten but can get infected merely from blood or saliva . A. 's stomach lurches sickeningly as she tries to remember if the squirrel B. beheaded could have bled or drooled on the rug , and she is preparing to hide her dread by bringing up the two old women bitten on the face , weeks and dozens of miles apart , both by rabid raccoons ... <p> Just at that moment the phone rings . Answering , the receptionist says , " Oh , hello , Mr. E. " <p> A. knows the rules of politeness : she should pretend not to listen , but feels that at this moment the rules have been suspended , because Mr. E. is the last name of A. 's boyfriend , D. <p> D. is not , strictly speaking , her boyfriend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be her boyfriend but has n't called for two weeks , and she fears they may have broken up , but without her knowing . In fact she does n't want to know , which is why she has n't called him , and the longer this goes on ... well , it could go on forever . <p> From hearing the receptionist 's end of the conversation , A. concludes that something is critically wrong with D. 's ( Mr. E. 's ) parrot , F. In the year that A. has been in love with D. , this parrot has suffered and recovered from several life-threatening ailments that caused all its feathers to drop out and a milky film to cover its eyes . A. has heard , from the other side , several such conversations  --  essentially the other half of the conversation that the receptionist is now having with D And yet , surprisingly , it never came up that A. and D. have the same veterinarian . A. always preferred to say as little as possible about the fact that she has a cat and D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons for their not living together . <p> A. is only mildly surprised by the coincidence of D. 's calling the veterinarian while she and B. are there . After a week of D. 's not calling , A. happened to phone her brother-in-law , G. , a friend of D. 's  --  and D. was there when she phoned ; this is how she knows he 's not dead , just not calling . At the start of their love everything was coincidental  --  their meeting , their both dropping by M. 's party though each had a cold , their having the same thoughts at the same time even with their small city between them , and of course A. always thinking of D. , the second before he called . Lately she has been thinking of him at many seconds when he does n't call . So his phoning the vet while she is there may be a step in the right direction , back toward a time when destiny seemed to have nothing to do but fling them together . <p> At last the receptionist calls B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vet 's examining room . Dr. C. is a plump little wombat of a man with a curly red beard and hair , and strong stubby hands into which A. gratefully surrenders B. The doctor sets B. on the table and shines a light in his ears as A. struggles against the desire to shout out loud that all B. needs  --  that all A. can afford  --  is a rabies booster . <p> But now the doctor is complimenting A. on her concern for her pet , most people do n't know you can get infected merely from blood or saliva , just as people do n't want to admit how much Lyme disease is around . Dr. C. never goes hiking without rubber bands around his cuffs . But A. is hardly listening , she no longer even worries as the doctor checks B. 's teeth and give his testicles a squeeze . She is thinking that having overheard the news of the parrot 's illness is a perfect excuse to call D. She would call a friend  --  a distant friend  --  in a similar situation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the syringe . The cat recoils from the needle . A. is overcome by a wave of love for B. that intensifies as she realizes that her cat could not have been purposefully cruel , at worst he was acting out the pain he 'd felt streaming out of A. Her cat would never have hurt her just because she 'd been hurt by D. <p> That evening A. dills D. 's number and then turns out the lights ; she sits in her dark kitchen , stroking B. 's fur  --  sleepy from the vaccination , he 's doting on her lap  --  and listening to D. 's phone ring . Finally D. answers . <p> There is no way for A. to convince herself that D. sounds happy to hear from her . <p> " How is F. ? " she asks . <p> " What do you mean ? " D. says , warily . <p> " I 'm worried about him , " A. says . <p> " What do you mean ? " D. repeats . <p> Already they have gotten off on the wrong footing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lover calls to ask after his ill pet . " I 'm worried he 's sick again , " says A. <p> " What makes you think that ? " says D. <p> Why ca n't A. just tell him that she 's overheard his call to the vet ? Why ca n't she point out that this coincidence signals a return to that happy time when what seemed like pure chance was in fact a conspiracy of fate to knit them tighter and tighter ? It would probably annoy him  --  he might think she was making it up about being at the vet . Something is terribly wrong ! A nice gesture , an ordinary act of human kindness and concern has been made to seem inappropriate , pushy  --  sexually aggressive ! <p> " How did you know he 's sick ? " asks D. <p> " I dreamed it , " A. hears herself saying . " It was the strangest thing . Last night I dreamed a parrot was perched on my hand and all its feathers started  --  " <p> " Oh , Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll call you back , okay ! " <p> A. is still holding the phone long after D. has hung up . The most humiliating part is that she feels herself mouthing the question : When ? A siren blares inside her head , set off by the knowledge that D. so clearly loves a dumb bid more than he loves her . In the very beginning , she 'd mistaken this for a good sign , a sign of his ability to love , to care about a parrot . <p> A female voice  --  a computer voice  --  tells her : please hang up . Startled , A. leans forward to replace the receiver and , in doing so , forgets about B. Abruptly woken , B. cries out and bites A. on the hand . Now A. cries out , too , and half rising , spills B. onto the floor . B. makes no effort to cling to her lap . As A. sinks back into her chair , she hears B. pad out of the room . <p> The pain is so searing , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get B. vaccinated too late ? Or , by some freak accident , too early ? Could B. be harboring the rabies bacillus , a result of the vaccination , and in a one-in-a-million coincidence , have transmitted it to A. ? And could A. have somehow dreamed all this ? Everything is so familiar . She should get up , call the doctor , get antibiotics , hot water  --  but she remains in her chair . <p> Sitting in the dark kitchen , cradling her injured hand , A. considers the two old women bitten by rabid raccoons . And now at last she understands how wrong she was about that . The real news was not that it happened twice , but that it happened at all , that someone was shocked from a deep sleep in her own bed in the middle of the night and looked up into those dark masked eyes and those spitty razory teeth , and almost , almost saw something there , something she recognized , in the moment before the pain flared up and burned everything else away . <p>  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
