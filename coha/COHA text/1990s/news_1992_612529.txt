<p> Tampa - Busch Gardens ' elaborate new Myombe Reserve is the only place outside Africa where gorillas can see people in the mist . <p> A little more than half of the lush , three-acre habitat contains the last family of gorillas from the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center in Atlanta . The remainder holds a troupe of five female chimpanzees , one with an infant . <p> Both Dr. Frederick King , director of the Yerkes Center , and Dr. Kenneth Gould , the center 's chief of reproductive biology , agree the exhibit that opened here this week is easily as good as those in Atlanta , New Orleans and San Diego , and perhaps better . <p> " It 's really nice , " says Sam Winslow , curator of mammals at Zoo Atlanta , who visited the exhibit a few weeks ago . " It 's got a lot of good viewpoints from the public standpoint , a lot of space for the animals to move around in . Given the kind of climate they 've got , they can grow a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as ours , " Mr. Winslow said , " and better than New Orleans or San Diego . " <p> It is much larger than Zoo Atlanta 's Ford African Rain Forest , completed in 1988 . Zoo Atlanta houses four families totaling 18 gorillas in four compounds , all on about 2.2 acres . It is lushly planted , with bamboo groves , hibiscus and palm trees that give it a more exotic look . <p> Where Zoo Atlanta has one glass viewing area through which visitors can get up close and personal with the residents , Busch has two , both somewhat larger . Their interiors have been made of the same artificial stone as the cliffs of the habitat to give a vague cave-like feeling , but more importantly , both have been constructed with a large overhang that keeps the area in front of the glass in shade - inviting the gorillas to remain there longer . <p> There are all-weather television cameras , painted to blend with their immediate surroundings , scattered about the habitats . They feed images into monitors in the glassed-in viewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved into more remote areas as well as letting their keepers keep track of them . <p> Non-glass viewing areas , where the animals are separated from their visitors by moats , provide spectacular waterfall vistas . <p> The most striking difference , however , is the mist generators , almost invisible , in bushes and high in trees all over the area . <p> About an hour before the park opens at 9 a.m. , the generators are turned on full blast . The result is a roiling fog so dense visibility is limited to about two feet , and one expects a fully furred Lon Chaney to rise snarling from the murk . <p> Nearly all the mist generators are along the walkways , in the tops of trees and around the high circumferences of the habitats . The idea is that by opening time the mist will rise up somewhat , giving the guests a " Gorillas in the Mist " shudder of excitement while never obscuring the animals . <p> Busch Gardens will not say how much the Myombe Reserve , built in nine months , cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 4.5 million , and experts say Myombe may have cost as much as $ 8 million . <p> However , all the mist generators in the world may not mean as much to the Busch Gardens visitor as the amazing amiability of the Yerkes gorillas During the press preview , the only threat displays were presented by television cameramen and the apes seemed enthralled with their visitors . <p> A young woman washing the glass at one of the areas found Pojo , a 13- year-old female , watching intently , her breath rhythmically fogging the thick window . The window-washer brought her white cloth to a stop a foot above Pojo 's head . The gorilla , in a move so swift it scarcely registered , covered the rag with her right hand . The washer snatched the rag away and slapped it to the window two feet lower . Pojo matched the move instantly - anthropoid pat-a-cake . <p> As photographers jostled for position , Pojo , Kishina and Inaka , the three Yerkes females , lounged in front of the glass like Sports Illustrated bathing suit models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the animals had worn away the grass in front of the glass . Attendants covered it with straw , and the females rolled langorously on their backs , using fistfuls of straw to coyly cover themselves . Vast bellies that can not be blamed on Busch 's chief product quivered like hairy bowls of Jello . <p> While the females were disporting , Simsim , a 6-year-old male , dashed back and forth in front of the glass like an excited boy . <p> Only Makini , a 10-year-old male , was not to be seen . Makini was always the group 's " Mr. Cautious , " said Yerkes spokeswoman Cathy Yarborough , and his new keepers say he only rarely has ventured outdoors in the two weeks the apes have been allowed into the outdoor habitat . He sits by the door , they say , and the females occasionally bring him bits of fruit and appear to be encouraging him to join them . <p> Yerkes has all 27 of its gorillas on loan . There are 16 at Zoo Atlanta , four at Audubon Park in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , zoo as well as the five here . <p> " Yerkes is the only research center in the world that has gorillas , " said Dr. King as he viewed the exhibit this week . " They are very expensive to maintain , and only observational studies can be done on an endangered species . " <p> Thus , he said , it made sense to farm the huge animals out to zoological parks delighted to have them - gorillas can cost a zoo up to $ 200,000 apiece , he said - while Yerkes still maintains full ressearch rights to the animals . <p> " We have a better chance of getting grant money from zoological groups than from the federal government anyway , " Dr. King said , and with gorillas living in more natural surroundings than Yerkes could provide , " we 'll probably get greater accuracy with our studies . " <p> A sociological experiment somewhat similar to the celebrated socialization of Willie B. must be undertaken at Busch . The park has its own young silverback , Lash , who has been residing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the holding area here , and will be gradually introduced to the Yerkes group . <p> Unlike Willie , he has been in gorilla groups before . The most ticklish thing will be his relationship with Makini , and Dr. Gould acknowledged " there is some risk involved . " Lash is expected to become head of the group in a few months . <p> Mr. Winslow believes the absence , for the time being , of a mature male may influence the females to interact more closely with humans . Dr. Gould expects the last five gorillas to leave Yerkes have become so close to humans because they received all the attention that was once spent on five times than many animals . Dr. King is a little sad about that . <p> " We try not to get too close to the animal emotionally because you can rob it of its own identity , " he said . " It may have trouble breaking away and dealing with its own kind . "
