For all the talk about trust , character and family values during the campaign , the issue that killed George Bush at the polls was the same issue that plagued him all year long : the economy . The country 's anxiety over kitchen-table concerns allowed Bill Clinton to put together a coalition that is more diverse than any that has elected a Democrat since Lyndon Johnson 's triumph three decades ago . Though Ross Perot 's presence kept Clinton 's popular vote under 50% , the Democratic coalition has the potential to endure much as &lt; the Republican alliance did in five of the past six presidential elections . <P> States as diverse as New Hampshire and California went Democratic Tuesday for the first time since 1964  --  not because two young Southerners wowed voters there , but because both states had plunged from prosperity during the Bush years . In the national exit poll conducted by Voter Research &; Surveys , a consortium of TV networks , 43% of voters named the economy as the paramount issue  --  twice the percentage identifying any other concern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1 . <P> From the earliest primaries , the Arkansas Governor stressed his ideas for overhauling the economy , just as he attacked Bush 's wan performance in that area . Bush , unable to boast about protecting prosperity , invested much of his rhetoric  --  and his party 's energy  --  in issues that voters viewed as peripheral . Bush captured two-thirds of those who considered " family values " critical , but only 15% of the electorate fell into that category . Similarly , the G.O.P. sought to hold its conservative base by giving a large megaphone to its antiabortion faction . Bush led among those who think that abortion should be illegal under all or most circumstances , but that group made up only one- third of the electorate . Clinton captured the larger pro-choice faction . <P> White Christians who call themselves Fundamentalists stayed loyal to the Republicans , as they had in the past three elections . Even in this right- leaning group , however , the Democratic ticket of two born-again Southern Baptists made inroads , drawing more white Evangelicals than either Michael Dukakis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and partly because Ross Perot ate into Bush 's support , the Democrats were able to reclaim parts of the South and Southwest . Those regions had been the stoutest of Republican strongholds for most of the past quarter-century , since Richard Nixon perfected his Southern strategy . <P> Early in his term , Bush and his top advisers set out to capture a larger share of the African-American bloc . That effort failed in the end , another victim of the party 's lunge toward the far right . Bush received only 11% of the black vote , half what he had once hoped to achieve . Jewish Americans , another group targeted under the " big tent " strategy that imploded , also eluded Bush . Seventy-eight percent voted Democratic , with 11% for Bush and 11% for Perot . Four years ago , Bush won 35% of Jews . Among white voters of all religions , Clinton tied Bush  --  a better showing than a Democrat has made since 1976.                  @ @ @
