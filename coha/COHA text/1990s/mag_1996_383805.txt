You want to help when someone 's injured , not add to the problem . That 's why careful Headnote assessment of the situation is so vital . // It 's early winter , but snow cover is sparse and you 've headed out for an invigorating weekend in the woods . A few miles into your brisk hike , the trail switchbacks up a steep hillside , then down again . That 's when you see him-a young man , unconscious , blood smeared across his face . What now ? In the heady rush of a traumatic situation , two things are paramount . First , do n't panic . Second , make a careful assessment of the victim's-and your-situation . You will need a clear perspective , and for this you might want to step outside yourself . Pretend you 're someone else like Sherlock Holmes , whose eyes would miss nothing and whose mind would shift effortlessly into high gear . Since you 're now Sherlock and we all know he 'd never panic , you 've handled the first concern . As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own well-being into the accident equation , but think about it : At the scene of any emergency the last thing you want to do is create a second victim . Precious moments taken to stand and survey the scene for safety are often the most valuable of the rescue . Ask yourself , " Could what happened to this guy also happen to me ? " Take a deep , calming breath and look around for obvious dangers . Could he have been hit by falling stones , and are there more up there waiting to answer gravity 's call ? Is a chilly wind picking up , which could make you hypothermic while tending to the victim ? You can usually quickly address your personal safety , but you should never fail to consider it . In this case , you find no apparent dangers , but your survey of the scene reveals the partial contents of a backpack scattered uphill . Looking more closely , you notice what appears to be a thin glaze of ice on the trail two switchbacks up ahead . Congratulations . Sherlock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deduction tells you that the hiker probably slipped on the ice , then tumbled downhill . Now , with a better understanding of the circumstances , you can move to the patient 's side , although you ca n't begin first-aid measures because you still do n't know what 's wrong . The first step is to identify and treat any immediate threats to life . INITIAL SURVEY When trying to figure out what could kill this victim quickest , it helps to remember the ABC 's of medical assessment . His Airway could be blocked and he might not be able to Breathe . He may not be getting oxygen to his brain because his Circulation system is n't functioning properly . In other words , his heart may not be pumping ( CPR ) is a vital skill everyone should know . With CPR you 're using artificial ventilation and chest compressions to simulate a victim 's basic life processes . It 's far too involved to get into here , and it must be taught by knowledgeable medical technicians . Courses are offered regularly in most communities by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so check your phone book . The other half of assessing circulation involves bleeding , which falls into two categories : the usually manageable venous kind , in which the blood flows smoothly but rapidly , and the more serious arterial . If blood pulses or spurts from a wound each time the patient 's heart beats , you 're faced with life-threatening arterial bleeding . A quick look is often enough to detect serious bleeding , but not always . If the injured person is wearing bulky winter apparel or raingear , check inside the clothing . If he 's lying in sand , rocks , or any terrain that might disguise blood loss , carefully check underneath the injured person for signs of blood . Severe blood loss can also occur internally . To control bleeding , use your hand to apply pressure directly to the wound . If you 're dealing with an arm or leg , lift the limb above the level of the person 's heart to reduce blood flow . ( When dealing with any body fluids , you should wear protective gloves . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself by applying pressure over a folded T-shirt or some other piece of clothing . Wash your hands thoroughly when finished , even if you wear gloves . ) Disability : Down through the cervical vertebrae runs the all-important spinal cord . If damaged , the result is often permanent paralysis or death . Suspect spinal injury if any one of the following are present : The person is unconscious . The injury was the result of a potentially neck-breaking situation , such as impact from a fall . The person complains of neck pain . There 's tenderness in the neck ( it hurts when touched ) . Sensations in the extremities are different that normal ( tingling , numbness , or inability to move hands or feet ) . Anyone who might have a cervical spine injury should be kept still . Talk to the person calmly and keep your hands on his head . The injured person must be evacuated by professionals with medical and rescue skills . Exposure to a harsh environment . To check for injury you may need to expose parts of the victim 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times like this , the environment can become a threat if he 's exposed long enough to cold , wind , or rain . Simply covering him with a sleeping bag will help maintain body heat , and it can be easily moved for occasional observation and later for treatment . FOCUSED SURVEY Let 's assume your ice-slip victim passes his ABC 's and is n't likely to die . Now the search for clues becomes more focused . You 're about to undertake a complete field examination , with your goal being to find everything that 's not in perfect working order . At this point , Dr. Holmes would remove his magnifying glass from his coat pocket and proceed meticulously through three basic phases : 1 . Vital signs : These do n't tell you what 's wrong , but they do indicate how the patient is doing . Level of consciousness : This tells you how well the brain is communicating with the outside world . Use the AVPU scale for quick reference . Is he Alert and able to tell you who he is , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verbal stimuli appropriately ? Put another way , when questioned does he answer , or just grunt and moan ? Does he respond only to Painful stimuli , such as a pinch to the back of the upper arm ? Is he Unresponsive ? The lower his level of consciousness , the worse the person 's condition . Skin : Normally skin in non-pigmented areas , such as the inner surface of the eyelids and the fingernail beds , is pink , warm , and slightly moist ( this is ( Continued on page 118 ) true for all races ) . Changes in skin color , temperature , and moisture reflect changes in the patient 's physical condition . Heart rate : A normal heart rate is strong and regular , and approximately 60 to 80 beats per minute . To quickly determine the victim 's pulse , count for 15 seconds then multiply by four . Pay particular attention to whether the pulse is weak or irregular . Breathing rate : Count the number of breaths per minute . Normal lungs work about 12 to 20 times per minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exam : Check the person from head to toe , and look for wounds , swelling , or other deformities . If he can respond , ask where it hurts . Feel gently but firmly by using a massage-like action with your hands spread wide . This will elicit a pain response , even if the person is unconscious , without causing any further damage . 3 . Patient interview : If he 's conscious , you can get vital information by simply asking the following SAMPLE questions . If he 's unconscious , ask witnesses these questions . S ( signs and symptoms ) : Do you have any pain , nausea , lightheadedness ? A ( allergies ) : Any known allergic reactions ? M ( medications ) : Have you taken any legal or illegal medications ? P ( past history ) : Has anything like this ever happened before ? L ( last oral intake ) : When was the last time you ate or drank ? E ( events ) : What led up to the accident or illness ? Your Sherlockian approach has helped you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man sprawled across the trail . In fact , by the time you 've finished your assessment , he has regained consciousness and tells you he 's ready to hike out . The fall apparently knocked him out for just a few minutes , and the smear of blood resulted when he bit his lip . You stay with him for an hour or so , which is enough time for signs of hidden injuries to show up . To be safe , you can suggest that he head back out and be examined by a physician , then move on with peace of mind . Note : If his injuries had been more serious , you would have had to stabilize him to prevent further injury , then seek professional medical help and have him evacuated . All of this will be the topic of an upcoming Body Language . <p>
