Just home from football practice , Bobby Granderson perches on a stool in his family 's kitchen . Normally he shaves his own head , but tonight his dad Bobby Sr. is running the electric razor . It 's an awkward moment ; this is the most the two of them have spoken in weeks without throwing a gibe . His father compliments Bobby 's handling of the clippers . He 's been trying to talk his son into going to trade school or perhaps opening a barbershop with him . The remark hits a nerve , but Bobby hides it . Will his dad ever understand him ? <P> At 18 , Bobby is at an inflection point that will largely determine the course of his life . Right now he 's got athletic talent and fame , and everyone wishes him well . But will he build on that , or will he peak as a senior in high school ? He has applied to join the Navy , but still hopes for a football scholarship to college . One problem : his GPA is 1.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to a 2.0 to be eligible for college sports and , more important , to get enough English credits to graduate . Another is that until this year , no one gave him knowledgeable advice on how to go about winning an athletic scholarship . <P> Bobby gets a lot of tough love at home . As suave and polite as he seems to outsiders , he has " two personalities , " says his stepmother Willie . " He 's a con artist . " His parents kicked him out of the house in August , trying to scare him after he came home drunk at 5 a.m . Later his father told him to do something , and Bobby refused . " I got tired of hearing what he was n't going to do , " says Bobby Sr. , who smacked him with a stick , hurting his feelings more than anything . Bobby walked to a gas station and called police , who sided with his dad . <P> His parents lock their bedroom because Bobby " borrows " money , CDs  --  even shoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coats and wallets . He goes to school mostly to see the girls and skips class as he pleases . Last year he had 109 tardies . <P> When Bobby was in elementary and middle school , his grades were above average .

He wants to have friends and does have them , but it 's something that causes him to worry . " Now his friends worry his parents . He seldom introduces them to his friends , many of whom are white and come from affluent families . " He thinks we 're country bumpkins , " says Bobby Sr. " This young man lives in a fantasy world . He wants to be rich . " <P> His parents are so concerned that they recently fell on their knees and prayed , " Good Lord , show us something . " Their answer came in the mail . The Navy sent a letter saying Bobby had failed his physical ; urine tests detected marijuana . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out anyway . Ice tried to talk to him , and Bobby walked out . When he went back to apologize yesterday , the coach shut the door , telling him he knew and reminding him that the team depends on him as a leader . " He 's a walking time bomb , " says Mark Eason , who runs a youth basketball program and has watched Bobby grow up . " When I see him , he 's so polite . He 's so nice . But inside , he 's crying .
