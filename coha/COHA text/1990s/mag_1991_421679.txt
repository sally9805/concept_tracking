Section : COVER STORY Achieving an affluent retirement is easier than you may think . <p> If you have given even a little thought to your future retirement  --  and by age 40 , most people have  --  your mental picture probably looks something like this : an attractive home , perhaps overlooking a windswept beach or a freshly mown fairway . Two well-waxed cars in the garage , one late-model , the other vintage sports . Plenty of trips to sunny Arizona or Florida  --  possibly even to Europe as well . And no matter where you decide to be , a cluttered social calendar . <p> That dream life is really not too different from the retirement fantasies of most middle- to upper-middle-income members of your parents ' generation . But there is an important difference now : your dream is most likely clouded by the fear that sometime after you leave work , your money will run out , leaving you destitute , a burden to your children , then finally a charge of the state . <p> Why was n't your parents ' generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Today 's retirees were a lucky exception to history , " explains Richard Michel , an economist at the Urban Institute , a policy-research group in Washington , D.C. and a co-author of The Economic Future of American Families ( Urban Institute , $13.75 ) . For generations , retirees were forced to fall back on their children for financial support . By contrast , Michel says , your parents ' generation was all but guaranteed a comfortable retirement by a succession of breaks during their working years . In the ' 50s and ' 60s , family income after inflation rose rapidly , more than 3.5% a year on average , while housing costs for young families were low ( about 16% of family income ) . Home prices outpaced inflation by some four percentage points annually during the ' 60s and five percentage points annually during the mid- ' 80s . The return on stocks averaged an unprecedented 12% a year after inflation in the ' 80s , while Treasury bonds delivered 7% real returns . Meanwhile , Social Security payouts beat inflation by 2.8 percentage points annually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't expect the same ride . Wages , house prices and investment returns will probably grow at a slow to moderate pace during the ' 90s and beyond . In fact , anyone who thinks there is no need to prepare for retirement better think again . " Some workers who have never been poor will be poor in retirement , " warns Deborah Chollet , associate director of the Center for Insurance Research at Georgia State University . <p> Fortunately , no matter what your age , you can escape an ugly future if you make the right moves  --  beginning now . This package of stories will get you started . In this article , we help you put together a practical retirement plan if you are 10 years or more from leaving work . If you do n't have that long , do n't despair . The article on page 100 explains what to do if you are running out of time and have to catch up fast . And finally , in the story on page 106 , we describe the best strategy for managing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In drawing up your plan , keep these facts in mind : <p> To live as well as you do now , you will probably need at least 80% of your current income . While work-related costs will decline in retirement , younger retirees in their fifties and sixties are likely to sharply increase their travel and other leisure expenses ; in addition , out-of-pocket medical costs will climb as you grow older . In fact , says Kaycee Krysty , an accountant and financial planner with the accounting firm Moss Adams in Seattle , many of tomorrow 's active retirees will find that their spending equals 100% of their pre-retirement income . But careful spenders may be able to get by on as little as 70% . ( To calculate your own required savings , just fill out the worksheet on page 90 . ) <p> You probably have n't been saving enough . Michel 's study of wage and health trends found that while Americans ages 55 to 64 in 1993 will have assets of almost $300,000 per household , workers ages 35 to 44 will amass only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire . The chief reason : because income growth has slowed , the average savings rate dropped from 7% to 9% of after-tax income in the ' 70s to as little as 3% during the ' 80s , though it has recently rebounded to 4.1% . <p> You ca n't count on the equity in your house to bail you out . The house-price inflation of the mid- ' 80s gave home owners a windfall beyond the home equity they would normally have accumulated during their working lives . But over the next 20 years , housing prices on average are likely to rise by only about 6% a year , one percentage point or so higher than the projected inflation rate of 5% . <p> An inheritance from your parents probably wo n't be enough to keep you comfortable . Edward Wolff , professor of economics at New York University , estimates that the average bequest to today 's 30- to 44-year-olds will be around $100,000 in 1991 dollars . If such a sum drops into your lap , be thankful . But 75% of the $100 billion in bequests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. families . And even if your parents are affluent , you may never see a dime  --  especially if one of them lives well past 80 or requires years of costly health care . <p> Social Security and pensions will replace only 45% of the average married man 's pre-retirement income . By contrast , that replacement figure is 49% today , according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington , D.C. Reason : generally rising earnings will outstrip such inflation-indexed benefits . <p> Not everything is negative , though . You do have a great advantage your parents did n't  --  tax-deferred savings accounts such as Individual Retirement Accounts , Keoghs for the self-employed , profit-sharing plans and 401(k)s . With one or more of these accounts , you can stash as much as 25% of your earnings each year and have it compound tax-free until you start withdrawing money after age 59 1/2 . If a couple in their mid-forties today with joint earnings of $50,000 made the most of such accounts , they could accumulate $900,000 ( $340,000 in today 's dollars ) by age 65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all full-time workers  --  including more than 45% of those at companies with at least 100 employees  --  only 60% of those eligible contribute to them . Also , less than 15% of the 67 million eligible workers put money in fully deductible IRAs last year , while just 12% of the 6 million self-employed have Keoghs . Passing up these opportunities is criminal . With a typical 401(k) , for example , you can contribute as much as $8,475 of your salary this year ; the limit rises annually with inflation . In addition , many employers chip in $0.50 or more for each $1 you invest up to a set amount , usually 6% of your salary . An even more stunning fact : according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute , more than half of today 's workers who get lump sums from pensions or tax-deferred savings accounts when they quit a job spend the money instead of saving it . " Everyone agrees that they should be saving more , " says Paul Hewitt , an economist with the National Taxpayers Union in Washington , D.C. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care and other expenses that were n't so burdensome for their parents . " Case in point : average mortgage costs for young families have increased tenfold over the past 30 years to $650 a month , compared with a sixfold increase in monthly income to $3,000 . <p> As difficult as saving may be , especially in a recession year like this , it 's the only way that you can be sure of ever having the life in retirement that you deserve . If you 're 20 years from retirement , you should set aside at least 5% to 10% of your annual income . The required amount could climb to 20% or more , though , if you put off saving until the last decade of your career . <p> Saving alone wo n't be enough . You will also have to invest your money wisely  --  by aiming for steady , long-term growth . If you put away $5,000 a year in money-market funds and it compounds tax deferred at 6% annually , you will have $183,928 after 20 years . But use stocks or equity funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9% to 10% , and you 'll have $255,801 or more . <p> A higher rate of return also means that you will have to set aside less to meet your goal . For example , say you want to accumulate $500,000 over 20 years . If you invest only in a money fund that beats 5% inflation by one percentage point annually , you will have to sock away $13,592 a year . But if you boost your annual return to 9% , you need put aside only $9,773 a year , or $376 per biweekly paycheck . <p> In aiming for a 9% return , of course , you will have to sweat out periods of stock losses , as Boston hotel executives Steven and Jean Cohen , pictured on page 84 , know all too well . Steven , 40 , wants to wind up his career in 10 or 15 years ; Jean , 36 , hopes to work " until the day I die "  --  but suspects she might change her mind . In mid-1987 , the couple invested about 80% of their $100,000 retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign stocks and small-company shares . Despite a bruising $20,000 loss  --  20% of their total portfolio  --  in the October ' 87 stock market crash , the Cohens have since added $20,000 in new savings to their funds . Aided by the stock market 's rebound , their equity holdings now total $140,000 . " If we were in our sixties , we 'd have felt devastated by the crash , " says Jean . " But we 're young enough to wait for the market to come back  --  and it did . " <p> Stocks may be volatile , but they 're the way to go . According to Ibbotson Associates , a Chicago investment research firm , the S &P; 500-stock index has gained an average of 10% annually over the past 65 years , outrunning inflation by seven percentage points a year . By contrast , Treasury bills have provided annual inflation-adjusted returns of 1% or less . <p> In addition , if you invest for 20 years or so , the volatility of top-quality stocks and equity funds is n't as worrisome as you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding periods between 1926 and 1991 , Pittsburgh money manager Roger Gibson found that stocks provided higher returns than bonds or Treasury bills during every period . Further , the worst 25-year return for stocks  --  5.9% compounded annually before inflation from 1929 through 1953  --  was only 1.5 percentage points lower than the best 25-year annualized return for any of the other assets . Says Gibson : " If you are investing for 25 years , stocks are actually safer than bonds or cash . " <p> Gibson 's statement might strike you as heresy  --  especially if you grew up in a home where an investment in savings bonds was viewed as the outer limit of speculation . And it is true that stocks are risky over shorter time spans . For example , the S &P; 500 suffered losses of 1% to 48.6% during seven of the five-year holding periods studied by Gibson . By contrast , the worst five-year performance among other holdings was a 10.6% loss for corporate bonds from 1964 through 1969 . The lesson of his research for most people : keep 30% to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can then expect to earn an average of around 10% a year without sleepless nights . <p> The pie charts in the box above show two portfolios that can offer such returns . The first option : invest 60% of your holdings in blue chips and large-company growth stocks , and divide the rest between high-quality bonds and cash . This simple portfolio may be the only practical approach for investors who have the bulk of their retirement savings in a 401(k) , because such plans usually offer only three or four investment options . According to data from Bailard Biehl &; Kaiser , an investment firm in San Mateo , Calif. , such a basic portfolio would have delivered a compound annual return of 10.4% over the past two decades , compared with 11.1% for the S &P; 500  --  with only two-thirds of the S &P's; volatility . <p> Investors with more varied 401(k) choices at work or a substantial amount of retirement savings outside of tax-deferred plans might consider this second strategy : Put 70% of your money in a mix of large-company growth stocks , small-company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bonds and 10% in cash . Such a portfolio 's broad diversification will keep risk within reasonable bounds , and you can expect to beat the simpler portfolio 's annual return by a percentage point or so . <p> In general , investment advisers recommend that you earmark money you have in tax-sheltered accounts for the bond and cash portions of your retirement portfolio . The reason : you can defer taxes on the interest income that you earn . Stocks are better suited for holdings outside of tax-sheltered accounts , because you do n't have to pay taxes on your gains until you sell . <p> About one in three 401(k) plans offers a bond fund ; most others limit fixed-income investors to short-term assets such as guaranteed investment contracts , which are roughly comparable to bank CDs that mature in one or two years . With IRAs , of course , you can invest in almost any fixed-income fund . Don Phillips , editor of the newsletter Mutual Fund Values in Chicago , recommends two top no-loads  --  that is , funds that have no initial sales charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $1,000 minimum ; 800-472-3389 ) and Vanguard Fixed Income  --  GNMA ( recent yield , 8.6% ; $3,000 minimum ; 800-662-7447 ) . <p> If you must keep the bulk of your money outside of a tax-deferred account , you might consider Treasury or government agency issues for the fixed-income part of your savings . They are backed by the federal government or its agencies , so there is no risk of default . Issues that mature in three to 10 years are among the most attractive choices . Over the past 25 years , such intermediate-term bonds have delivered annual total returns of 8.3%  --  compared with 6.9% for long-term bonds  --  while offering about 40% less price volatility . <p> Alternatively , investors in the 28% federal tax bracket or higher ( taxable income above $34,000 for married couples filing jointly ; $20,350 or more for singles ) might consider tax-exempt bonds . At recent yields of about 6.3% , intermediate-term munis offer the equivalent of 8.7% or more from a taxable bond . As a rule , you need at least $25,000 for a diversified portfolio of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual funds that hold issues with credit ratings of A or better . Phillips recommends two top-performing muni funds , USAA Tax-Exempt-Intermediate ( recently yielding 6.8% ; $3,000 minimum ; 800-531-8181 ) and Vanguard **27;173;TOOLONG ( recent yield , 6.5% ; $3,000 minimum ; 800-662-7447 ) . <p> For cash investments , most 401(k)s offer little choice . Only one in three includes a money fund . If possible , choose a government money fund . Such funds currently yield as much as 6.7% , and run virtually no risk of default because they invest in Treasury bills and the short-term securities of government agencies . The funds are wise choices outside of a 401(k) as well because they are typically exempt from state and local taxes , which can add the equivalent of half a percentage point to your yield . Walter Frank , chief economist for IBC/Donoghue 's Money Fund Report in Holliston , Mass. , recommends one of the highest yielders in this category , Benham Government Agency Fund ( 6.7% yield ; $1,000 minimum ; 800-472-3389 ) . <p> The trickiest part of building a retirement fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors or those with less than $25,000  --  not counting money in a 401(k)  --  often lean toward mutual funds . As you become more experienced and your assets grow , however , you can consider assembling shares of five to 10 individual stocks in different industries . Brokerage commissions will run about 1.5% of each purchase or sale . But if you hold shares for at least three years , that total 3% transaction cost amounts to the same or less than what you would pay a typical no-load fund with annual expenses of 1% or so . Here 's a quick look at the key equity categories : <p> Blue chips . These are shares of industry leaders with strong finances , well-established products and a history of rising earnings and dividends . Chuck Carlson , editor of the newsletter Dow Theory Forecasts in Hammond , Ind. , recommends companies that pay dividend yields of around 3% and can sustain annual earnings gains of 10% or so over the next five years . That works out to a projected total return of 13% or more . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratios below 17 , the average P/E for the S &P; 500 . His two top picks , which carry P/Es of 14 : American Home Products , a pharmaceutical company with annual revenues of $6.8 billion that recently traded on the New York Stock Exchange at $59 and yielded 3.9% , and $45.3 billion General Electric ( NYSE , $72.50 ) , which yielded 2.8% . <p> Within a 401(k) , you can probably invest in blue chips through a diversified equity fund . Outside such a plan , you can buy blue chips through large growth and income funds such as Fidelity Growth &; Income ( three-year total return , 69% ; 2% load ; minimum investment , $2,500 ; 800-544-8888 ) or no-load Selected American Shares ( three-year total return , 63.3% ; $1,000 minimum ; 800-553-5533 ) . <p> Large growth stocks . <p> These include the shares of companies with strong brands in fast-growing domestic and overseas markets . Typically , such stocks yield less than 3% , but they can deliver earnings growth of at least 15% a year . Carlson recommends those with P/Es @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ( NYSE , $34 ) , yielding 1% , and $7.1 billion H.J. Heinz ( NYSE , $37.50 ) , paying 2.6% . <p> Within a 401(k) , you may be able to invest in these shares through a growth or aggressive growth fund . For other fund investors , Ken Gregory , editor of the L/G No-Load Fund Analyst newsletter in San Francisco , recommends Twentieth Century Select Investors ( three-year total return of 58.2% ; no minimum ; 800-345-2021 ) or Vanguard World-U.S . Growth ( three-year total return , 81.2% ; $3,000 minimum ; 800-662-7447 ) . <p> Small-company growth stocks . Despite their volatility , the shares of these companies , typically those with annual sales of less than $500 million , have returned an average of 11.6% annually over the past 65 years , compared with 10.1% for the S &P; 500 . Prices of small stocks have surged 46% since October , but many analysts think that small-company shares are still cheap by long-term measures . <p> Elliott Schlang , an executive vice president with Prescott Ball &; Turben in Cleveland , recommends that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of at least $200 million , strong market niches and solid finances . His picks include two firms with projected earnings growth of 15% or more and P/Es of 14 or less : $225 million Clarcor , recently traded over the counter at $32 a share , which makes industrial filter systems ; and $500 million Gibson Greetings ( OTC , $26.75 ) , a leading producer of wrapping paper and greeting cards . Among small-company funds , Gregory recommends GIT Equity-Special Growth ( three-year total return , 33.4% ; $2,500 minimum ; 800-336-3063 ) and Nicholas Limited Edition ( three-year return , 55.1% ; $2,000 minimum ; 414-272-6133 ) . <p> Value stocks . These issues trade at steep discounts to the estimated value of their assets or earnings prospects . From 1984 through April of this year , value stocks gained only 14.1% annually , compared with 17.7% for the S &P; 500 , according to Trinity Investment Management in Cambridge , Mass . But Charles Brandes , a money manager in San Diego , notes that value stocks typically rebound sharply from periods of mediocre performance . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have recently traded at P/Es under 12 . Among them : $22 billion diversified manufacturer United Technologies ( NYSE , $45.75 ) , which recently carried a P/E of 11.4 , and $13.1 billion Loews Corp . ( NYSE , $105.25 ) , which owns large stakes in media , financial and tobacco companies , and sports a P/E of 10 . Among top value-oriented funds , Ken Gregory favors Windsor II ( three-year total return , 53.7% ; $3,000 minimum ; 800-662-7447 ) and Lindner Fund ( three-year total return , 33.9% ; $2,000 minimum ; 314-727-5305 ) . <p> Foreign stocks . Since February , the dollar 's gain against other major currencies has reduced the value of foreign shares for U.S. investors by 10% to 15% , and analysts say the greenback could rise another 5% by yearend . Currency fluctuations tend to balance out over periods of 10 years or more , however . Diversifying overseas will therefore reduce your risk and could boost your long-term returns . Indeed , international stocks have outperformed all other major asset categories during nine of the past 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading overseas companies such as Grand Metropolitan ( NYSE , $28.75 ) , a $17 billion consumer-goods company , and registered shares of $37 billion Nestle ( OTC , $57.25 ) . Both trade in the U.S. as American Depositary Receipts ( ADRs ) . Among international funds , Don Phillips recommends two with strong performance records : Harbor International ( three-year total return , 69.5% ; $2,000 minimum ; 800-422-1050 ) and Scudder Global ( three-year total return , 49.2% ; minimum of $1,000 ; 800-225-2470 ) . <p> Once your portfolio is in place , check the mix once a year and rebalance your holdings when sharp price moves for stocks or bonds shift your allocations by five percentage points or more . For example , after a 20% rise in stock prices , you should transfer enough money into bonds/and cash to restore the original balance . In addition , redo the calculations in the retirement-planning worksheet on page 90 every year to see whether your portfolio is growing quickly enough to meet your target . If you fall behind schedule , increase your savings or rethink your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay for a retirement that 's free of regrets . GETTING THE MOST GROWTH <p> When your retirement is still 10 or more years away , you should be willing to take reasonable risks to make your principal grow steadily . The simple approach outlined in the top chart is particularly well suited for 401(k)s and other retirement plans that limit you to a handful of investment options . This basic diversified portfolio could deliver average gains of about 9% a year during the next decade . <p> If you have the time and skill to set up and monitor a more complex portfolio , you can boost your average annual return by a percentage point or two . To do that , you should divide your money among the six investment categories shown in the lower chart , buying either individual issues or mutual funds . While this mix includes some potentially volatile assets , such as small growth stocks and foreign issues , they are counterbalanced by more secure investments such as high-quality bonds and money funds . As a result , you can expect this portfolio to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more risk .
