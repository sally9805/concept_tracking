To his credit as a Cal Coolidge conservative , President Bush does not interfere with the internal affairs of a sovereign nation , the United States . Since all agree that the country 's internal affairs are in woeful shape , this should give the Democrats a fine opportunity to pelt him with rotten fruit and dead cats in the most important political yard sale of the quadrennium , next February 's New Hampshire primary . Here in New Hampshire , however , we are looking at our watches and asking , " What Democrats ? What primary ? " <P> The only announced candidate to show up so far is Paul Tsongas , a decent fellow who needs career counseling . This is serious , because New Hampshire 's economy is based largely on primary filing fees and the political media 's bar bills . <P> " Du n no , " said Mildred , my neighbor . " Seems like Mario Cuomo should be here by now . " We met at the town recycling center . She was trying to slip an elderly single-bed mattress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " No mattresses , " said the hopper commandant . <P> " The lady before me dumped a television . " <P> " Yup . But no mattresses , " the environment 's guardian told her . I helped Mildred stuff the mattress back into her old Pinto , the one with the REGISTER LIBERALS , NOT GUNS bumper sticker just below the LIVE FREE OR DIE license plate . A Democrat with a solution to New Hampshire 's mattress problem could win it all . I know one man who had to bury two old mattresses in his pasture , like dead cows . Anyway , in all primary seasons up to now , you would have found Gary Hart or some other left-winger with good teeth staked out at the town dump , ready to shake your hand . <P> That noon at the Peter Rabbit diner I met Brisket , who owns the big motel by the interstate , and Graftwell , the paving contractor . They were having lunch with the Town Fool , one of our town 's two registered Democrats . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delano Roosevelt , on the theory that F.D.R. at room temperature was smarter than Bob Dole or George Bush at 98.6 . The Constitution , he had pointed out , requires that a President be native born and at least 35 years old , but does not insist that he be alive . After the ritualistic denunciation of the Red Sox , which is required of New England males , our conversation turned to the missing candidates . " Do n't sweat it . They 're just a little late , is all , " said Graftwell . He looked sweaty as he said this . <P> " They 've got to come , " said Brisket , a Sununu monarchist . <P> " Heigh-ho , primary woe , " sang the Fool , jingling the little bells on his cap . <P> " What in tarnation does that mean ? " Brisket demanded . Folks in New Hampshire practice saying " tarnation " and " ay-yuh " every four years for the network news . <P> " Rumble dee , rumble dum , Democrats are n't going to come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> " That 's foolish , " said Brisket , out of patience . Then he added , " Sorry . No offense intended . I just meant . . . " <P> " Quite all right , " said the Fool , pulling a red , white and blue streamer out of his right ear .
