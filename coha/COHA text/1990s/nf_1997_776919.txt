I // A Mate Plantation in Misiones // I // The horoscope was confounding . If the famous guerrilla revolutionary Ernesto " Che " Guevara was born on June 14 , 1928 , as stated on his birth certificate , then he was a Gemini  --  and a lackluster one at that . The astrologer , a friend of Che 's mother , did her calculations again to find a mistake , but the results she came up with were the same . The Che that emerged was a grey , dependent personality who had lived an uneventful life . There were only two possibilities : Either she was right about Che , or she was worthless as an astrologer. // When shown the dismal horoscope , Che 's mother laughed . She then confided a secret she had guarded closely for over three decades . Her famous son had actually been born one month earlier , on May 14 . He was no Gemini , but a headstrong and decisive Taurus . // The deception had been necessary , she explained , because she was three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Immediately after their wedding , the couple had left Buenos Aires for the remote jungle backwater of Misiones . There , as her husband set himself up as an enterprising yerba mate planter , she went through her pregnancy away from the prying eyes of Buenos Aires society . When she was near term , they traveled down the Parana River to the city of Rosario . She gave birth there , and a doctor friend falsified the date on her baby 's birth certificate , moving it forward by one month to help shield them from scandal . // When their baby son was a month old , the couple notified their families . Their story was that they had tried to reach Buenos Aires , but at Rosario Celia Guevara had gone into labor prematurely . A baby born at seven months , after all , is not an out-of-the-question occurrence . If there were any doubts , the couple 's story and their child 's official birth date were quietly accepted by their families and friends , and remained unchallenged for years . // If that child had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parents ' secret might well have gone with them to their graves . He must be one of the rare public figures of modern times whose birth and death certificates are both falsified . Yet it seems uniquely fitting that Guevara , who spent most of his adult life engaged in clandestine activities and who died as the result of a secret conspiracy , should have also begun life with a subterfuge. // II // When , in 1927 , Ernesto Guevara Lynch first met Celia de la Serna , she had just graduated from the exclusive Buenos Aires Catholic girls ' school , Sacre Coeur . She was a dramatic-looking girl of twenty with an aquiline nose , wavy dark hair , and brown eyes . Celia was well read but unworldly , devout but questioning . Ripe , in other words , for a romantic adventure . // Celia de la Serna was a true Argentine blue blood of undiluted Spanish noble lineage . One ancestor had been the Spanish royal viceroy of colonial Peru ; another a famous Argentine military general . Her paternal grandfather had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a renowned law professor , congressman , and ambassador . Both he and his wife died while Celia was still a child , leaving her and her six brothers and sisters to be raised by a religious guardian aunt . But despite her parents ' untimely deaths , the family had conserved its revenue-producing estates , and Celia was due a comfortable inheritance when she reached the legal age of twenty-one . // At twenty-seven , Ernesto Guevara Lynch was both moderately tall and handsome , with a strong chin and jaw . The glasses he wore for astigmatism gave him a deceptively clerkish appearance , for he had an ebullient , gregarious personality , a hot temper , and an outsized imagination . He also possessed Argentine surnames of good vintage : He was the great-grandson of one of South America 's richest men , and his ancestors included both Spanish and Irish nobility . But over the years , his family had lost most of its fortune . // During the nineteenth century Rosas tyranny , the male heirs of the wealthy Guevara and Lynch clans had fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from exile , their American-born offspring , Roberto Guevara Castro and Ana Isabel Lynch , had married . Ernesto was the sixth of their eleven children . They lived well , but they were no longer landed gentry . While her husband worked as a geographical surveyor , Ana Isabel raised the children in Buenos Aires . They summered at a rustic country house on her inherited slice of the old family seat . To prepare his son for a working life , Roberto Guevara had sent him to a state-run school , telling him : " The only aristocracy I believe in is the aristocracy of talent . " // But Ernesto still belonged by birthright to Argentine society . He had grown up on his mother 's stories of California frontier life , and listening to his father 's own terrifying tales of Indian attacks and sudden death in the high Andes . His family 's illustrious and adventurous past was a legacy too powerful to overcome . He was nineteen when his father died , and although he went to college , studying architecture and engineering , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own adventures and make his own fortune , and he used his father 's modest inheritance to pursue the goal . // By the time he met Celia , Ernesto had invested most of his money with a wealthy relative in a yacht-building company , the Astillero San Isidro . He worked there for a time as an overseer , but it was not enough to hold his interest . Soon he was enthused about a new project : A friend had convinced him he could make his fortune by growing yerba mate , the stimulating native tea ritually drunk by millions of Argentines. // Land was cheap in the yerba-growing province of Misiones , twelve hundred miles up the Parana River from Buenos Aires on Argentina 's northern border with Paraguay and Brazil . Originally settled by Jesuit missionaries and their Guarani Indian converts in the sixteenth century , annexed only fifty years earlier by Argentina , Misiones was just then opening up to settlement . Land speculators , well-heeled adventurers , and poor European migrants were flocking in . Guevara Lynch went to see it for himself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tied up in the astillero , but , with Celia 's inheritance , they would be able to buy enough land for a yerba mate plantation , and , he hoped , become rich from the lucrative " green gold . " // Unsurprisingly , Celia 's family closed ranks in opposition to her dilettante suitor . Celia was not yet twenty-one , and under Argentine law she needed her family 's approval to marry or receive her inheritance . She asked for it , but they refused . Desperate , for by now she was pregnant , she and Ernesto staged an elopement to force her family 's consent . She ran away to an older sister 's house . The show of force worked . The marriage was approved , but Celia still had to go to court to win her inheritance . By order of the judge , she was granted a portion of her inheritance , including title to a cattle and grain-producing estancia in central Cordoba province , and some cash bonds from her trust fund  --  enough to buy a mate plantation in Misiones. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wed in a private ceremony at the home of a married older sister , Edelmira Moore de la Serna . La Prensa of Buenos Aires gave the news in its " Dia Social " column . Immediately afterward , they fled Buenos Aires for the wilderness of Misiones bearing their mutual secret . " Together we decided what to do with our lives , " wrote Guevara Lynch in a memoir published years later . " Behind lay the penitences , the prudery and the tight circle of relatives and friends who wanted to impede our marriage . " // III // In 1832 , British naturalist Charles Darwin had witnessed the atrocities waged against Argentina 's native Indians by gaucho warlord Juan Manuel de Rosas , and predicted : " The country will be in the hands of white Gaucho savages instead of copper-coloured Indians . The former being a little superior in education , as they are inferior in every moral virtue . " // But even as the blood flowed , Argentina had spawned its own pantheon of civic-minded historical heroes , from General Jose de San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Spain , to Domingo Sarmiento , the crusading journalist , educator , and president who had finally wrested Argentina into the modern age as a unified republic . Sarmiento 's 1845 book , Facundo ( Civilization and Barbarity ) , had been a clarion call to his compatriots to choose the path of civilized man over the brutality of the archetypal Argentine frontiersman , the gaucho . // Yet even Sarmiento had wielded a dictator 's authority to lead the country , and with his death the Argentine cult of the strongman , or caudillo , had not disappeared . Caudillismo would remain a feature of politics well into the next century as government swung back and forth between caudillos and democrats in a bewildering , cyclical dance . Indeed , as if reflecting the sharp contrasts of the great land they had conquered , there was an unreconciled duality in the Argentine temperament , seemingly balanced in a state of perpetual tension between savagery and enlightenment . At once passionate , volatile , and racist , Argentines were also expansive , humorous , and hospitable . The paradox had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of literature such as Ricardo Guiraldes 's Don Segundo Sombra and the gaucho epic poem Martin Fierro by Jose Hernandez. // Since the 1870s , the country had become more stable . And , when the conquest of the southern pampas was finally secured after an officially sponsored campaign to exterminate the native Indian population , vast new lands had opened up for colonization . The pampas were fenced in as grazing and farming lands ; new towns and industries sprang up ; railroads , ports , and roads were built . By the turn of the century , its population had tripled , swollen by the influx of over a million immigrants from Italy , Spain , Germany , Britain , Russia , and the Middle East who had poured into the rich southern land of opportunity  --  and still they came . // A dismal colonial garrison on the vast Rio de la Plata estuary only a century before , the city of Buenos Aires now had a melting pot 's combustive quality , epitomized by the sensuous new culture of tango , its dark-eyed crooner Carlos Gardel giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke their own creole street dialect called lunfardo , an Argentine cockney rich in double entendres , cribbed from Quechua , Italian , and local gaucho Spanish . // The city 's docks were bustling : Ships carried Argentina 's meat , grains , and hides off to Europe while others docked bringing American Studebakers , gramophones , and the latest Paris fashions . The city boasted an opera house , a stock exchange , and a fine university ; rows of imposing neoclassical public buildings and private mansions ; landscaped green parks with shade trees and polo fields , as well as ample boulevards graced with heroic statues and sparkling fountains . Electric streetcars rattled and zinged along cobbled streets past elegant , bronzed-doored confiterias and wiskerias with gold lettering on etched glass windows . In their mirrored and marble interiors , haughty white-jacketed waiters with slicked-down hair posed and swooped like vigilant , gleaming eagles . // But while Buenos Aires 's portenos , as they called themselves , looked to Europe for their cultural comparisons , much of the interior still languished in nineteenth-century neglect . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cotton- and sugar-growing lands . Among their workers , diseases such as leprosy , malaria , and even bubonic plague were still common . In the Andean provinces , the indigenous Quechua- and Aymara-speaking Indians known as coyas lived in conditions of extreme poverty . Women would not be given the vote for another two decades , and legal divorce would take even longer . Vigilante justice and indentured servitude were features of life in much of the hinterland. // Argentina 's political system had not kept pace with its changing society and had stagnated . For decades , two parties , the Radical and the Conservative , had ruled the country 's destiny . The current Radical president , Hipolito Yrigoyen , was aging and eccentric , a sphinxlike figure who rarely spoke or appeared in public . Workers had few rights , and strikes were often suppressed by gunfire and police batons . Criminals were transported by ship to serve terms of imprisonment in the cold southern wastes of Patagonia . But , with immigration and the twentieth century , new political ideas had also arrived . Feminists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their voices heard . In the Argentina of 1927 , political and social change was inevitable , but had not yet come . // IV // With Celia 's money , Guevara Lynch bought two hundred hectares ( about five hundred acres ) of jungle along the banks of the Rio Parana . On a bluff overlooking the coffee-colored water and the dense green forest of the Paraguayan shore , they erected a roomy wooden house on stilts , with an outdoor kitchen and outhouse . They were a long way from the comforts of Buenos Aires , but Guevara Lynch was enraptured . With an entrepreneur 's eager eye , he looked into the jungle around him , and he saw the future . // Perhaps he believed he could , as his grandfathers had done before him , " restore " the family fortunes by intrepidly striking out into new and unexplored lands . Whether or not he was consciously emulating his forefathers ' experiences , it is clear that for Guevara Lynch , Misiones was his own " Wild West " adventure . To him , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place full of " ferocious beasts , dangerous work , robbery and murders , jungle cyclones , interminable rains and tropical diseases . " // He wrote : " There , in mysterious Misiones ... everything attracts and entraps . It attracts like all that is dangerous , and entraps like all that is passionate . There , nothing was familiar , not its soil , its climate , its vegetation , nor its jungle full of wild animals , and even less its inhabitants .... From the moment one stepped on its shores , one felt that the safety of one 's life lay in the machete or revolver .... " // Their homestead was in a place named Puerto Caraguatai , named in Guarani after a beautiful native red flower , but its puerto was just a small wooden jetty . Caraguatai was reached by a two-day river journey up from the old trading port of Posadas on the Ibera , a venerable Victorian paddle-wheel steamer that had done prior service carrying British colonials up the Nile . The nearest outpost was the small German settlers ' community of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had a friendly neighbor who lived a few minutes ' walk through the forest . Charles Benson was a retired English railway engineer and an avid angler , and just above the river he had built himself a white , rambling bungalow with its own internal " water closet " imported from England . // For a few months , the Guevaras spent an enjoyable time settling in and exploring the area . They sportfished , boated , and rode horses with Benson , or else drove into Montecarlo on their mule-drawn buggy . To eight-year-old Gertrudis Kraft , whose parents ran a little hostel on the Montecarlo road , the Guevaras were admirable , " rich and elegant people , " whose rustic home by the river was " a mansion . " // The Guevaras ' honeymoon idyll , such as it was , did not last long . Within a few short months , Celia 's pregnancy was well advanced , and it was time to return to civilization , where she could give birth in greater comfort and security . The couple set out downriver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of three hundred thousand inhabitants . There , Celia went into labor , and their son Ernesto Guevara de la Serna was born . // His doctored birth certificate , drawn up at the civil registrar 's office on June 15 , was witnessed by a cousin of Guevara Lynch 's who lived in Rosario and a Brazilian taxi driver evidently drafted at the last minute . The document says the baby was delivered at 3:05 A.M. on the morning of June 14 , in his parent 's " domicile " on Calle Entre Rios 480. // The Guevaras remained in Rosario while Celia recovered from the delivery of " Ernestito . " They rented a spacious , three-bedroom apartment with servant 's quarters in an exclusive new residential building near the city center , at the address given on the birth certificate . Their stay was prolonged when , shortly after his birth , the baby contracted bronchial pneumonia . Ernesto 's mother , Ana Isabel Lynch , and his spinster sister Ercilia came to help out . // If the couple 's families suspected anything , they kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his mother told him that " Ernesto was born in a clinic in Rosario on the 14 of June 1928 . The address that appears on the birth register is where he lived the first days , but not where he was born . Possibly it was the house of a friend , or that of the taxi driver who was a witness .... " // Of course , the truth , as Celia later told Julia Constenla de Giussani ( who had arranged for Che 's astral chart to be drawn up by their mutual astrologist friend ) , was that she had actually given birth in May , on the same day , and at the same hour as a striking dockworker nicknamed " Diente de Oro " ( Gold Tooth ) died of gunshot wounds . // The yellowing archives of Rosario 's daily newspaper La Capital confirm the story . In May 1928 , a strike by Rosario 's dockworkers had escalated into violence . Almost every day , stabbings and shootings had taken place , most of them carried out by strikebreaking armed scabs working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At 5:30 P.M. on Tuesday , May 13 , 1928 , a twenty-eight-year-old stevedore named Ramon Romero , alias " Diente de Oro , " was shot in the head during a fracas at the Puerto San Martin . At dawn the next day , May 14 , he died in the Granaderos a Caballo Hospital in San Lorenzo , about twenty kilometers north of Rosario. // V // After a whirlwind round of visits with their families in Buenos Aires to show off their infant son , the Guevaras returned to their homestead in Misiones. // Guevara Lynch now made a serious attempt to get his plantation off the ground . He hired a Paraguayan foreman , or capataz , named Curtido , to oversee the clearing of his land and the planting of his first crop of yerba mate . But when it came to hiring laborers , he had to confront the system of labor bondage , still practiced widely in the untamed region . // In Misiones , loggers and owners of yerbatales usually hired itinerant Guarani Indian laborers called mensu , who were given binding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages according to how much they produced , mensu received not cash but private bonds , valid only to purchase basic essentials at the overpriced plantation stores . The system virtually ensured that they could never redeem their original debts . Armed plantation guards called capangas kept vigilant watch over the work crews to prevent escapes , and violent deaths by gunshot and machete were frequent occurrences . Fugitive mensu who escaped the capangas but fell into the hands of police were inevitably returned to their patrones . Guevara Lynch hired mensu himself , but he was no yerba baron , and , horrified at the stories he heard , he paid his workers in cash . It made him a popular patron , and many years later , he was still remembered by local workers as " a good man . " // As Guevara Lynch worked his plantation , his young son was learning how to walk . To help train him , his father used to send him to the kitchen with a little pot of yerba mate to give the cook for boiling . Invariably stumbling along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry on . Another routine developed as a consequence of the pernicious insects that infested Caraguatai . Every night , while his son lay sleeping in his crib , Guevara Lynch and Curtido crept quietly into his room . While his patron trained a flashlight on his son , Curtido carefully used the burning tip of his cigarette to dislodge the day 's harvest of chiggers burrowed into the baby 's flesh . // In March 1929 , Celia became pregnant again . She hired a young Galician-born nanny to look after Ernestito , who was not yet a year old . Carmen Arias proved to be a welcome new addition to the family ; she would live with the Guevaras until her own marriage eight years later , and remain a lifelong family friend . Freed from child-minding , Celia began taking daily swims in the Parana . She was a good swimmer , but one day when she was six month 's pregnant , the river 's current caught her . She would probably have drowned if two of her husband 's axmen clearing the forest nearby had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to safety . // Guevara Lynch reprovingly recalled many such near-drowning episodes involving Celia in the early years of their marriage . Already , Celia and Ernesto 's very different personalities had begun to collide . She was aloof , a loner , and seemingly immune to fear , while he was an emotionally needy man who liked having people around him , a chronic worrier whose vivid imagination magnified the risks he saw lurking everywhere . // But while the early signs of their future marital discord were already in evidence , they had not yet pulled apart . The Guevaras took family excursions together , either horse rides on the forest trails , with Ernestito riding on the saddle mount in front of his father , or river excursions aboard the Kid , a wooden launch with a four-berth cabin that Guevara Lynch had built at the Astillero San Isidro . Once , they traveled upriver to the famous Iguazu falls , where the Argentine and Brazilian borders meet , and watched the clouds of vapor rise from the brown cascades that roar down from the virgin jungle cliffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more for the long trip downriver to Buenos Aires . Their land was cleared and their yerbatal had just been planted , but Celia was about to give birth to their second child , and Guevara Lynch 's presence was urgently needed at the Astillero San Isidro . During his absence , business had gone badly , and now one of its investors had withdrawn . They planned to be away only a few months , but they would never return as a family to Puerto Caraguatai . It was the end of what Ernesto Guevara Lynch recalled as " difficult but very happy years . " // VI // Back in Buenos Aires , Guevara Lynch rented a bungalow for his family on the grounds of a large colonial residence owned by his sister Maria Luisa and her husband , located conveniently near his troubled boatbuilding firm in the residential suburb of San Isidro. // They had not been there long when Celia gave birth , in December , to their second child , a little girl they named Celia . For a time , while Guevara Lynch went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outings to the San Isidro Yacht Club , near the spot where the Parana and Uruguay Rivers join to form the Rio de la Plata estuary . // Guevara Lynch found the shipyard on the edge of bankruptcy , purportedly due to the lack of business sense of his second cousin and business partner , German Frers . For Frers , independently wealthy and a sailing regatta champion , the astillero was a labor of love . Such was his enthusiasm to create nautical works of art that he had poured money into fine craftsmanship and expensive imported materials , which often cost the company more than the agreed-to selling prices of the boats it produced . Guevara Lynch 's investment was in serious risk of evaporating . Then , soon after his return , a fire destroyed the shipyard . Boats , timber , and paint all went up in flames . // If the shipyard had been covered by insurance , the fire might have seemed a fortuitous event . But Frers had forgotten to pay the insurance premium , and Guevara Lynch lost his inheritance overnight . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As partial compensation , Frers gave Guevara Lynch the Ala , a twelve-meter motor yacht . // All was not lost . The Ala was worth something , and they still had their Misiones plantation , which Guevara Lynch had placed in the hands of a family friend to administer in his absence . Hopefully , they would soon see annual revenues from its harvests . In the meantime , they had the annual income from Celia 's Cordoba estate . Between them , they had plenty of family and friends ; they were n't going to starve . // In early 1930 , Guevara Lynch certainly did n't seem unduly worried about the future . For some months he lived the sporting life , spending weekends cruising with friends aboard the Ala , picnicking on the myriad islands of the delta further upriver . In the hot Argentine summer ( November to March ) , the family spent the days on the beach of the San Isidro Yacht Club , or visited rich cousins and in-laws on their country estancias. // One day in May 1930 , Celia took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was already the onset of the Argentine winter , cold and windy . That night , the little boy developed a coughing fit . The doctor who attended him diagnosed him as suffering from asthmatic bronchitis and prescribed the normal remedies , but instead of subsiding , the attack lasted for several days . As the family soon realized , young Ernesto had developed a chronic asthma condition that would afflict him for the rest of his life and irrevocably change the course of their own . // Before long , the attacks returned and became worse . Ernesto 's asphyxiating bouts of wheezing left his parents in a state of anguish . They desperately sought medical advice and futilely tried out every known treatment available . The atmosphere in their home was soured . Guevara Lynch recriminated with Celia for her imprudence that day at the beach and blamed her for provoking their son 's affliction. // In fact , Guevara Lynch was being less than fair . Celia was a highly allergic person and suffered from asthma herself . In all likelihood , she had passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of his brothers and sisters also developed allergies and asthma , although none were to suffer from it as severely as he would . Ernesto 's exposure to the cold air and water had probably only activated symptoms that were already latent in him . // Whatever its cause , Ernesto 's asthma ruled out a return to the damp climate of Puerto Caraguatai . It was also evident that even San Isidro , so close to the Rio de la Plata , was too humid for their son . In 1931 , the Guevaras moved again , this time into Buenos Aires itself , to a fifth-floor rented apartment near Palermo Park . They were close to Ana Isabel , Guevara Lynch 's mother , and his spinster sister Beatriz , who lived with her . Both women showered affection on the sickly boy . // Celia gave birth for the third time in May 1932 , to another boy . They named him Roberto after his California-born paternal grandfather . Little Celia was now a year and a half old , taking her first steps , and four-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gardens . // But the move did n't cure him of his asthma . For Guevara Lynch , his son 's illness was a kind of curse : " Ernesto 's asthma had begun to affect our decisions . Each day imposed new restrictions on our freedom of movement and each day we found ourselves more at the mercy of that damned sickness . " // On the advice of doctors recommending a dry climate to stabilize Ernesto 's asthma , the Guevaras traveled to the central highlands of Cordoba province . For several months , they made trips back and forth between Cordoba and Buenos Aires , living briefly in hotels and temporarily rented houses , as Ernesto 's attacks calmed , then worsened again , without any apparent pattern . Unable to attend to his affairs or get a new business scheme going , Guevara Lynch became increasingly frustrated . He felt " unstable , in the air , unable to do anything . " // Their doctor now urged them to stay in Cordoba for at least four months to ensure Ernesto 's recovery . A family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town in the foothills of the Sierras Chicas , a small mountain range near Cordoba , with a fine , dry climate that had made it a popular retreat for people suffering from tuberculosis and other respiratory ailments . They took his advice . Thinking of a short stay , the family moved to Alta Gracia , little imagining it would become their home for the next eleven years .
