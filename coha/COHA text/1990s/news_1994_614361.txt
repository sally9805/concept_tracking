<p> When Nima Warfield 's mom heard in December that he won a prestigious Rhodes scholarship , she tapped into her network and cajoled Plainfield , N.J. , leaders to erect signs announcing it to the world . <p> The result : When Nima returned home from Morehouse College on break , banners of welcome greeted him along the streets . <p> This story says much about Delores F. BrownJohnson . She conceived , followed through and arranged the welcome just as she planned it . Focused and purposeful , BrownJohnson is relentless in reaching the goals she sets . And she set high goals for her children . <p> Hollywood moms , move over . BrownJohnson could teach you a thing or two . <p> She and Edward Warfield , her first husband , moved from Brooklyn 's Bedford Stuyvesant area to suburban Plainfield , N.J. , in the early ' 70s when Nima was an infant . And they decided early to make the education of their two sons , Nima and Nashad , a family priority . <p> Warfield encouraged the children in their education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Nima was 12 , he continued to stay in touch to follow his sons ' progress . <p> But most of the burden fell to the boys ' mother , who as a working single parent had to move the family to a less costly and rougher , drug- infested neighborhood . Her sons were latchkey kids who had to fend for themselves until their mother came home from her job at Johnson &; Johnson . But they thrived in school . <p> BrownJohnson took a leadership role in parent-teacher organizations , and supervised the boys ' studies . <p> The time and effort paid off . Nashad just completed his freshman year at Morgan State University . And today , as Morehouse holds its 110th commencement , Nima is graduating with an A average and a host of academic honors , including the Rhodes scholarship . <p> Nima joins an elite company of Rhodes scholars , including President Clinton and many leaders from all walks of life . Established in 1902 , the award provides at least two years of independent study at Oxford University in Britain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first scholarship winner from a historically black college . <p> The journey by young Nima from the gritty , predominantly black town of Plainfield to the hallowed , ancient halls of Oxford has been a long one . Nima recalls a rough beginning . <p> " When I was in elementary school , the peer pressure was against students who got good grades , and I got teased a lot , " he said . " I became shy and felt isolated . " <p> Then there was a turning point of sorts . Nima won the sixth-grade spelling bee , became the center of attention and for the first time heard applause for his achievements . <p> " Winning the sixth-grade spelling bee at Emerson Elementary School in Plainfield was really it , " he said , partly because it salved some wounds inflicted on the bookish youth . <p> " Winning and getting recognition made me feel special , and I liked that feeling , " Nima said . <p> Nima also was helped by a growing support system . His mother , who remarried in 1987 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brother also were nurtured in a religious and spiritual environment . <p> " It gave a sense of responsibility and structure to our lives , " BrownJohnson said . " Not only are we shaped by religious teachings but young men , in particular , grow through opportunities to perform tasks in church , and develop social and interpersonal skills . " <p> Nima 's early development was also shaped by his father , who read nightly to his toddler son , however weary he might feel coming home from his job with the New York City Sanitation Department . <p> " One day my father came home to discover me sitting alone with a book , opened in my lap , " Nima said . " I was two and a half , and I told him I was reading . At first he did n't believe it , but he was convinced when I was able to skip about and read passages as he pointed to them . " <p> It was an affirmation that the family was doing something right , BrownJohnson said . <p> Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where she began studying for an education degree , BrownJohnson formed her own reward system for good conduct . She asked the boys to list all their favorite activities , games and things to eat . Then good report cards or other accomplishments were rewarded with " chips " that could be exchanged for a favorite treat . <p> " The boys took to it , " she said . " And you can imagine how proud I was one day recently when I was having dinner with Nashad and some schoolmates at Morgan State , and one of his friends said , ' Nashad , ask your mother if you can redeem one of those chips and take us to King 's Dominion a theme park next weekend . ' " <p> BrownJohnson also made a habit of seeking male role models for the boys . At Johnson &; Johnson she became acquainted with young Kelvin Walker , a business intern from Morehouse , and introduced him to her son when Nima was 14 . <p> " Knowing him also helped me become interested in historically black colleges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus later made me fall in love with Morehouse . " <p> At Morehouse , Nima met another source of inspiration - Melvin Rahming , a Bahamian-born professor of English . The teacher helped goad him to excellence . <p> " He entranced me , " Nima said . " He was a phenomenal intellect and an excellent writer . He guided me from science into English , and he took a personal interest in me . " <p> Nima spent his third year at Morehouse studying Japanese in Nagoya , Japan , even though it meant he had to spend five years in undergraduate work to complete his degree requirements . In Japan , he studied Japanese language and culture , including Eastern religions , and the experience fired his ambition to do advanced scholarship . <p> A strapping , vigorous young man , Nima is a lifelong swimmer , who was on the swimming and track teams in high school . He was not a varsity athlete at Morehouse , but he continued to swim and also became an avid cyclist . Often he would ride his mountain bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an errand . <p> While many Rhodes scholars enter academia or professions like law , Nima has different plans . Though his scholarship stipulates two years of study , there is an option for a third year and he may try to exercise it . <p> " I would love to get a doctorate in literature , " he said . <p> After he returns from Oxford , Nima wants to become a teacher in a public high school , maybe even at his alma mater , Plainfield High . Later he would like to become a school principal or perhaps open his own independent school . <p> " When I consider what is important to me , I think about what I can leave behind to posterity . I think about the obvious joy that my teachers gleaned from watching me develop in response to their work . <p> " Not enough of our children see that kind of influence and inspiration . I 'd like to contribute my little bit . " <p> This commitment to education has been a hallmark of Nima 's life , one instilled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she preaches , earlier this month his mother , Delores BrownJohnson graduated from college as well , completing two degrees at once at Kean College , including a degree in early childhood education . <p> " Needless to say , I am very proud of her , " Nima said . The feeling , his mother says , is mutual . <p> Ernest Holsendolph is a staff writer and columnist for the Journal- Constitution .
