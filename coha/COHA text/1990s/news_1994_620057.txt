<p> HAITI AND THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS <p> Editor  --  As the Haiti saga unfolds and election day draws nearer , the buzz in America reverberates around the theme that President Clinton is attempting to save the Democrats ' stronghold in both houses of Congress . Conservatives are spinning the events of the threatened invasion and last-minute compromise as a desperate attempt by the president to bring home his party 's voters in November . There is no doubt that the successful diplomatic mission of former President Jimmy Carter , former General Colin Powell and Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia has given Clinton another much needed victory in the foreign policy arena . A current poll cited a 19-point surge in approval of how the president was handling the Haiti situation after the announcement that the invasion of the Caribbean nation had been averted . <p> However , it is somewhat perplexing to hear the political pundits of the right scoff at the policy on Haiti as a tool for the Democrats to secure congressional election victories in the fall . For one thing , many Democrats in Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . Even with the threat of battle reduced , U.S. troops began occupying Haiti several hours after Carter , Powell and Nunn returned home . <p> Secondly , members of Congress were not involved in deciding whether or not troops should be sent into Haiti , President Clinton having determined the War Powers Act did not apply . <p> How is it , then , that the Clinton administration 's Haitian policy equates to congressional election success in November ? Is a Congress member 's electoral fate going to be determined by something he or she had nothing to do with ? Or are Republicans planning to use this as an excuse if they still are the minority party in Congress after the November elections ? <p> CRAIG SCARPELLI <p> San Jose <p> . <p> ' NOT ONE DROP OF BLOOD ' <p> Editor  --  The phrase " not worth the blood of one American life " has become the yardstick used today to judge our foreign policy , by the general public and a former president and a former general . <p> Consider : A few months ago the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omaha Beach literally ran red with the blood of soldiers whose feet never even touched the shore . That effort cost , not one drop of blood , but every drop of the blood of thousands upon thousands of Americans . Should that effort now be vilified because that liberation did not lead to a perfect world ? <p> Consider : There are many today who would vehemently protest the risk of " one American life " to free the survivors of Dachau , Auschwitz , Buchenwald . What business was it of ours what Germany did within its borders ? Should we not have " interfered " ? Perhaps it died 50 years ago . <p> R. L. TARABINI <p> Fort Bragg ( Mendocino County ) <p> . <p> UNGOVERNABILITY <p> Editor  --  There is no victory to be won out of Haiti . It is a small country in disarray , plagued by military and civilian thugs who are unable to accept defeat . Likewise , the critics of President Clinton 's administration are unable to give credit where credit is due . Senate Republicans , not Clinton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire at the administration the moment the invasion began . Now they must find new ammunition during a time of peaceful transfer , providing CNN with even ing delights and entertaining despots around the world . <p> The outcomes of Haiti shall be no greater than the talents with which we addressed it . We brought to this small island a continued clash between the most powerful legislative and executive branches in the world , and it was too great a force for us to overcome . In the aftermath of this , an electoral struggle , critics have amassed more factions than the junta of Haiti could have ever imagined . <p> Haiti is our loss because its troubles are indicative of the way our country is run . Most analysts in Washington would prefer a Bud Selig for president who could cancel the foreign policy debate for the season and keep politics from being even a spectator sport . Are there any Democrats out there willing to play hardball and be satisfied enough with first base ? Republicans point out that Haiti would have been better swept clean by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuilding a society . They are right . The contortions of our body politic have left our country ungovernable , and we have projected ungovernability onto the rest of the world . <p> CALEB J. BUCKLEY <p> San Rafael <p> . <p> HUFFINGTON 'S ' MILLIONS ' <p> Editor  --  First we read that , although his family lived in California , Michael Huffington claimed Texas residency so he could dodge California taxes . Then it turns out that his company defaulted on a loan to a savings and loan , causing it to collapse . Taxpayers were subsequently forced to bail it out . Next we learn that Huffington 's company claimed bankruptcy and failed to pay millions in California taxes . It finally dawned on me that Huffington is n't spending millions in his own money to pay for his campaign , he 's spending millions in our money . <p> ERIC C. JOHNSON <p> San Mateo <p> . <p> FEINSTEIN VS . MILITARY <p> Editor  --  Apparently Senator Dianne Feinstein seems determined to eviscerate our country 's military force readiness and demoralize our military personnel . <p> Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 1.5 billion . These savings would be accomplished by requiring the vast majority of U.S. troops to be assigned one-year unaccompanied tours of duty by eliminating travel and transportation expenses for family members . <p> Recently the Pentagon offered early retirement to qualified members of our armed forces , with the supposition that 10 percent of those qualified would accept early retirement . Much to the dismay of the brass , 27 percent of those qualified accepted the offer . If our astute Senator Feinstein 's measure is enacted into law , we will see a major exodus of married , trained personnel from the military . Her legislation , coupled with early retirement , would completely destroy President Clinton 's goal to be able to fight and win two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts . <p> Why would Senator Feinstein propose such an ill-thought-out measure in an election year , when it is obvious that most military personnel based in California who are registered to vote here would vote for her opponent in the upcoming Senate elections ? <p> GEORGE R. EVANS <p> Palo Alto <p> . <p> BID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership bill on the grounds that it weakened the institution of marriage ; he is correct . Gays and lesbians need to stop begging for a subordinate legal status and make a bid for equality : demand civil marriage . <p> MATEO SANCHEZ <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> STILETTO ABUSE <p> Editor  --  In " Return of the Killer Stilettos " ( Chronicle , September 12 ) , there was a " professional " woman who wore high heels because she wanted " to send the right message " to her public school students . The message she is sending loud and clear is that she abuses her body . A secondary message is that women in mainstream professions are expected to abuse their bodies to be accepted . If this teacher/administrator wants to be a real leader for her students , she would wear shoes that honored her feet , protected them and gave her comfort during the day . <p> I get strange looks from time to time in the Financial District when I wear my soft-soled leather walking boots . But I get smiles from women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than fashion . <p> JULIA McDONALD <p> San Bruno <p> . <p> FASHION STATEMENT <p> Editor  --  In Jasmine Fox ( Letters , September 19 ) we have one more woman who sees herself as the victim . While I agree with most of her position regarding what it means to be a woman , her understanding of who is in control is off base . <p> Although I will admit to ignorance about fashion and fashion designers , I am sure that there are also many women designers creating " sexy " attire . Perhaps the most significant point missed by Ms. Fox is the function of the market . Consider who buys the clothing she finds offensive , as well as the " women 's " magazines that lay down the guidelines of fashion and behavior . The female consumer has the power to bring the industries that objectify women to their knees , if only they choose to use it . <p> ROGER D.
