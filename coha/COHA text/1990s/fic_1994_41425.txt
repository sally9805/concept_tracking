CONSTANCE AND THE SILKWEAVERS : WORKING WOMEN AND COLONIAL FANTASY IN . CHAUCER 'S " THE MAN OF LAW 'S TALE " <p> REDUCTIO . How should we begin ? <p> THEA . It was already going on . <p> CEBES . But let 's posit a start , an origin , anyway ... <p> CASSANDRA . Fine . What do you want to talk about ? <p> REDUCTIO . Well , I 've been thinking lately about the relationship between sexism and colonialism , and somehow my thoughts have taken me back , way back , to something premodern : the medieval Tale of Constance . <p> CEBES . That 's an uncommon set of thoughts ... <p> CASSANDRA . And why do you want to drag us all the way back to the Middle Ages to talk about sexism and racism ? There are so many modern example of those issues - <p> REDUCTIO . Because the story I 'm referring to suggests there has always some sort of intimacy between the way the West oppresses western women and the way it thinks about non-western cultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They also belong to the fabric of the European Middle Ages . <p> THEA . Wait a minute . This is a complicated matter , and I would n't know where to begin discussing it ... <p> REDUCTIO . I would . I assume you all know that Trivet , Chaucer , and Gower each wrote a version of the tale of Constance in the fourteenth century . <p> CASSANDRA . Well , not really ... <p> REDUCTIO . Yea you do . I know you know Chaucer 's version of the Constance story . It 's in " The Man of Law 's Tale . " <p> CASSANDRA . OK ... I guess you 're right . I was forced to read it before I dropped out of university ... <p> REDUCTIO . Good . Now , it seems to me that much remains to be said about all the slender threads that tie this poem to the social formation that produced it . There are connections here which are very rich and complex , so - <p> THEA . Feel free to take charge of the discussion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to begin unravelling this knot by trying to understand the world where Chaucer lived and wrote . By taking this approach I assume that any accurate reading of a poem has to relocate it within the network of discourses and social practices that gave rise to it . I realize that I ca n't recover the real past in which " The Man of Law 's Tale " was produced . I can only consult the work of modern historians who have studied documents produced in Chaucer 's time and created modern versions of his world . So I try to interpret " The Man of Law 's Tale by comparing it to modern texts which are interpretations of medieval texts . Get it ? <p> CASSANDRA . Our friends is very learned . <p> THEA . I 'm glad you 're trying to be direct about the theory which informs your critical practice , but I 'm not sure that you or I or anyone else can ever be fully conscious of all reasons for saying the things we say ... <p> CEBES . But we must keep talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring " The Man of Law 's Tale " to its reconstructed historical context . What discourses and social practices must we understand before we can get at this poem ? One question in particular occurs to me : is it possible to piece together a truly accurate historical interpretation of this text and its context , or are you instead proposing an interpretation that appears to be historical on its surface and yet is geared to contemporary purposes and guided by contemporary ideas ? You situate your discussion within the intersection of colonialism and sexism , but do n't these problems belong to the residue of modernity rather than to the medieval world picture ? <p> REDUCTIO . That 's precisely my point : practices such as sexism and colonialism take on different forms in different historical eras . There 's no reason to think that they are recent inventions . Since they 're not problems peculiar to modern western cultures , we have to include them in our understanding of the medieval European world picture . If we do n't , our reading of Chaucer will remain incomplete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary impasses if we recall that things once were otherwise and can be otherwise again . If you want revolution , then look to the past until the present blows up in your face . <p> THEA . Who asked for revolution ? <p> REDUCTIO . I did . Now , let me draw your attention to certain economic practices of the fourteenth century . Chaucer and his contemporaries lived in precapitalist market communities where people tended to produce goods for exchange and not just for private use . So the economies of these communities were geared towards trade rather than mere subsistence . People made things , like food products and manufactured goods , and sold them for profit . This particular mode of production and exchange occurred in towns and rural villages throughout late medieval England and throughout the western European economy which England belonged to at the time . What I propose is that the economy existed alongside a discourse of exchange , a particular way of talking and writing and thinking about the trade of commodities . That discourse saturates " The Man of Law 's Tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in The Canterbury Tales and - <p> CEBES . Why do you say this discourse existed alongside the economic order ? <p> REDUCTIO . It would be easy and very traditional for me to assume that the economic base preceded and gave rise to a particular way of thinking and using language , particularly poetic language , but I have no evidence to support that claim . It 's also possible that a certain way of thinking about exchange gave rise to a market economy based on production within the household . But all I know with any certainty is that the economy was there at the same time as the discourse of exchange . They were contiguous . <p> Now , discourse is a way of using words to make worlds . Words world , you might say . A discourse of exchange brings forth a world which revolves around the buying and selling of goods . For example , in the " Retraction " that closes The Canterbury Tales , Chaucer suggests that the world we call Christendom is a system where souls circulate like commodities between heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Tales in my briefcase ... somewhere under all this academic junk mail ... Look . It says right here that Christ is a merchant who has paid for the sins of humanity with the blood of his passion , and thereby " redeemed " people from eternal damnation . He is the " kyng of kynges and preest over alle preestes , that boghte us with the precious blood of his herte . " Chaucer hopes that his soul too has been bought , so that he " may been oon of hem at the day of doom that shulle be saved " ( X.1091 ) . What this means is - <p> THEA . Wait . What you say is intriguing , but do n't you think you 're attaching too much significance to this one metaphor ? Does Christian discourse always construe the act of redemption as trading in souls ? <p> REDUCTIO . Well , to redeem is to buy back , and the language of exchange certainly circulates through The Canterbury Tales . When the Man of Law tells his story , which of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world which is centered on trade . It 's rather complicated , but let me find the page ... it 's crumpled ... Merchants are producers of discourse , " fadres of tydynges/And tales " ( II.129-30 ) , and " The Man of Law is the neutral channel , the voice , through which merchant discourse speaks . The purpose of this discourse , moreover , is to give the activities of the merchant class a seemingly natural place in the social order of the European Middle Ages - but remember to put quotes around the word " natural . " Since medieval merchants were in the business of marketing commodities , especially luxury goods destined for royal and aristocratic courts , the merchant discourse that survives in Chaucer 's text is concerned with the buying and selling of precious things . <p> THEA . You 're suggesting that merchant circulate stories in order to validate their role in the market economy ? <p> REDUCTIO . Exactly . The Man of Law provides a particularly appropriate voice for this discourse because he does a lot of business with merchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of The Canterbury Tale , he is immediately identified with the economy of exchange . Of course , he is actually called a " Sergeant of the Lawe " in the " Prologue , " but - <p> CEBES . You mean his name is uncertain ? May be we were moving too quickly when we attached his signature , to this tale ? <p> CASSANDRA . Or any signature , for that matter . <p> REDUCTIO . Maybe , but I assume that the Man of Law and the Sergeant are in fact the same character , and this character is an eager buyer of things . It says right here that " So greet a purchasour was nowher noon " ( I.318 ) . As he rides towards Canterbury , he shows off some of the clothes he has bought from his merchant associates , including a " medlee cote/Girt with a ceint of silk , with barres smale " ( I.328-9 ) . He has even received his version of the life of Constance from a " marchant " storyteller ( II.132 ) . <p> CEBES . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the Man of Law use words to make a world where exchange is privileged ? And what does it all have to do with our world ? <p> REDUCTIO . I suppose I 've spent quite a bit of time talking around the tale of Constance , but I insist on putting it into a large context . You 've probably been waiting for me to get to the point ? <p> CASSANDRA . I have always encouraged you to a void the point . <p> REDUCTIO . Right , but I have to say something . What was I saying , anyway ? <p> CEBES . Words , worlds , discourse , merchants ... You were also going to explain what this medieval poem has to tell us about problems in the contemporary West . <p> REDUCTIO . Right . Since he arranges his narrative around the exchange of a particularly precious commodity , namely Constance , who is sold to the Sultan , the Man of Law creates a world which has mercantile activity at its foundation . The story presents the marketing of commodities as a necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice which belongs to a specific set of historical circumstances . In short , merchant discourse seeks to ensure that a world without merchants is entirely - <p> THEA . Sorry , but I 'm going to have to interrupt you here . <p> REDUCTIO . Oh . <p> THEA . What you say is intriguing enough , but you have n't offered much convincing evidence to support it . You have n't even discussed " The Man of Law 's Tale . " You 've also contradicted yourself in a revealing way . Although you claim at first that the Man of Law is merely a channel through which a discourse speaks , you go no to say that he is arranging a world which privileges merchants and trade . Sometimes he is author , and sometimes he is not . And where do Chaucer and Trivet , Chaucer 's source , fit into your reading ? Are n't they the real channels of merchant discourse ? Besides , the story is very old , so there 's no proof that it was intended to serve the interests of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of authorship to point out that stories articulate social interest , especially class interest , not the individual interest of individual authors . But now I 'm not exactly sure ... <p> THEA . I consider these contradictions important because they show that you 've misconstrued precisely what you set out to clarify , which was the relationship between " The Man of Law 's Tale " and the world in which it was produced . Now I - <p> CEBES . And is there a right relationship ? Let 's beware of descending into mere positivism and setting up a - <p> THEA . Fair enough . I would still argue that this text does not serve the interests of medieval English merchants at all . In fact , the values it expresses and the world it brings forth do not belong to any single class of medieval European society . Instead , " The Man of Law 's Tale " articulates the mentality of a patriarchy , which lies at the foundation of western culture . Chaucer , Trivet , and the Man of Law are voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production and exchange . I also think you 're collapsing the distinction between international trade carried on by international merchants and the local exchanges that went on in small communities . <p> CASSANDRA . Sounds vague . What 's patriarchy , after all ? Is it the same in every era and every culture ? I think the term is too general to be useful . It does n't help me understand specifics of sexism - let alone the way it changes through history and between different societies . <p> THEA . A patriarchy is a society in which women , as a group , are dominated and oppressed by men . But what I want to stress is that the patriarchal social order of the West is founded upon the exchange of women . Furthermore , the women who are exchanged can not enjoy the benefits produced by their own circulation . They are traded among men to serve the designs of men . <p> CASSANDRA . Well , you have n't begun to capture the full complexity of women 's oppression in the West , or anywhere else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> THEA . A mentally is hard to isolate . It can be found in all the ready-made ideas , all the cliches and intellectual junk which clutter the minds of people living in a community . Jacques Le Goff says it 's the collective expression of a period of history , the collective psychology of a society . What I say is that the elusive Geoffrey Chaucer is merely a scribe who has written the ready-made ideas of medieval patriarchy into " The Man of Law 's Tale . " These ideas do not originate with him ; instead , they come to him from his community and from Trivet 's chronicles . I think that if we subject Chaucer 's poem to a close reading , we can uncover some of the patriarchal junk and begin to - <p> CASSANDRA . Which is everything , because your definition of patriarchy is so broad it includes everything . You 're putting the particulars of history into universal terms . <p> REDUCTIO . But please continue . <p> THEA . Back to Chaucer . Can I see your book ? Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describing the adventures of a group of Syrian merchants . Like the merchants we were discussing earlier , these " chapmen riche " are in the business of providing the wealthy with luxury goods , such as " spicerye , /Clothes of gold , and satyns riche of hewe " ( II.135-7 ) . On one of their journeys , they sail to Rome in search of business and pleasure , and when they have seen the sights and " doon fraught hir shipper newe , " they head home to distribute Roman goods to the Orient ( II.171 ) . They arrive in Syria bearing news of someone who is considered a particularly valuable Roman commodity : the Emperor 's daughter , dame Custance . When the Sultan hears of this woman 's " greet noblesse " ( 185 ) , he decides he wants to marry her : " al his lust and al his bisy cure/Was for to love hir while his lyf may dure " ( 188-9 ) . <p> In the patriarchal social order , women are not perceived to be valuable in themselves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commodity whose value , which is really her exchange value , is determined by the needs and desires of the man who " consumes " her . If a man needs and wants a woman very much , she will be worth much to him ; if no man needs or wants her , she will be worth nothing . That 's what I 'm calling the patriarchal mentality . <p> Now , Custance is a valuable commodity precisely because the Sultan wants her so badly that he ca n't live without her . To have her , he willing to pay an enormous price . When his advisers tell him that " no Christen prince wolde fayn/Wedden his child " to a Muslim ( II.222-3 ) , the Sultan decides to renounce Islam , the religion of his people , and become a Christian . " Rather than I lese/Custance , " he declares , " I wol be cristned , doutelees. /I moot been hires , I may noon other chese " ( II.225-7 ) . His conversion is a sacrilege , but he is willing to risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - in order to get what he wants . She is worth it to him . Custance herself does not receive any profit from the transaction which sends her east . She feels only sorrow at the thought of leaving her " freendes " and travelling to a " strange nacioun " where she will be " bounden under subjeccioun/Of oon , she knoweth nat his condicioun " ( II.268-71 ) Yet since the only role available to her in the patriarchal order is the role of the passive object , the plaint commodity , she must suppress her own feelings and go along with marriage even if it kills her - " no fors though ( she ) spille " ( II.285 ) . <p> CEBES . So if you were to define the late medieval European mentality , you would say that it denies women the right to control their own destinies by transforming them into merchandise ? <p> THEA . Precisely . Custance offers an excellent description of the status of women in her society . " Wommen , " she says , " are born to thraldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( II.286-7 ) . She sees the injustice of her situation , but all she can do is to ask her god to give her the strength to - <p> CASSANDRA . So what defines patriarchy for you is the incest taboo which sets up culture out of a nature , the universal scarcity of women which founds the taboo , the advantages that accrue to men from establishing ties of kinship through the distribution of women , and all that other stuff pertaining to a supposedly universal human condition which whatshisname - Levi-Strauss - talks about somewhere . I do n't buy it because - <p> CEBES . Wait . No matter what you two say about the mentality of patriarchy , I think we have to emphasize that there is a connection in : The Man of Law 's Tale " between exchange , the oppression of women , and the colonization of the East . <p> THEA . Now you 're interrupting a - <p> CEBES . Because you 're forgotten to ask why the exchange of women has such an important place in patriarchal society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that kind of society . <p> CEBES . I think it 's important to extend your argument even further . We ca n't just dismiss the claim that human society is founded . <p> CASSANDRA . Oh no , here comes another myth about the origin of culture . I wish I had n't mentioned whatshiname . <p> CEBES. - on this prohibition of incest , which prevents a woman from marrying within her own family and forces her to unite herself with a man from another family . When two people from different families are married , moreover , their relatives are joined through bonds of kinship into a social relationship . In a patriarchal society , men give their daughters to other men in marriage to create alliances , mutual responsibilities , systems of obligation . The exchange of women between fathers and husbands is therefore the force that holds a patriarchy together . <p> CASSANDRA . But incest has never really been prohibited . Men have always raped their daughters , granddaughters , sisters . Even Levi-Strauss admits that - <p> REDUCTIO . And " The Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinship . <p> CEBES . You 're right . It 's more like a fantasy about the expansion of Christian Europe . <p> CASSANDRA . Did n't you hear me ? <p> CEBES . While it is customary for a woman to marry outside her immediate family , the Latin Church of the Middle Ages , as we have seen , prohibits all Christians , men and women , from marrying outside their religion . In the story of Custance , the Christian authorities use this ban on mixed marriages . <p> CASSANDRA . I was talking about rape - <p> CEBES. - to transform the patriarchal traffic in women into a strategy of conquest . Their plan is to ensure that the bonds of kinship created by marriage become bonds of control . <p> CASSANDRA . Do I have to spell it out ? <p> CEBES . The Christians realize that the Sultan 's desire for Custance offers them an excellent opportunity to acquire new and valuable territories in the East , and they eagerly agree to give her to him , as if she were so much chattel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CASSANDRA . R-A- <p> CEBES. - must convert to Christianity , and he must transfer control of his lands to the Christian authorities . The marriage is designed not simply to join Christendom to Islam , but rather to allow Christendom . <p> CASSANDRA . P-E <p> CEBES. - to engulf Islam , effectively erasing the boundary that divides Europe from the East . The Syrians and the Latins are to become one family , sharing one property . Let me draw your attention to the way in which the Man of Law outline the terms of the marriage contract ... May I have the book now ? Here 's what he says : I seye , by tretys and embassadrie , And by the popes mediacioun , And al the chirche , and al the chivalrie , That in destruccion of mawmettrie , And in encrees of Chirstes lawe deere , They been acorded ( II.233-8 ) . Trivet makes it clear , in his Chronicles , that the European " chirche " and knighted aristocracy , " the chivalrie , " want not only to destroy Islam , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also to gain free and open access to Jerusalem , the holy places of the Sepulchre , and Mount Cavalry , and Bethlehem , and Nazareth , and the Valley of Jehoshaphat , and all other holy places within the bounds of the Sultan 's dominion . <p> What the Christians hope to achieve by trading Custance to the Sultan is exactly what the leader of the First Crusade set out to accomplish by force of arms - the so-called liberation , which is also the colonization , of Palestine and Syria . One of the forces which seems to underlie the story of Custance is the idea the Christendom has the right , indeed the divine right , to drive the Muslims out of the Holy Land and claim it as a Christian colony . In the Middle Ages this idea , also known as the crusading idea , had a strong grip on the European mentality and was based on the belief that any culture which did not belong to the Latin Church was unworthy to occupy the places where Christ was supposed to have lived and preached . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it perpetuates the crusading idea long after the Crusades themselves had ended in failure . Chaucer probably transcribed his version of this tale , this artifact of the medieval mentality , in the late fourteenth century , almost a hundred years after Egyptian army had recaptured the city of Acre , the last Crusader colony in the East . The narrative takes place during the reign of Constantine yet articulates a desire for conquest which belongs to late medieval Europe : a Europe which has recently been shut out of the Holy Land . <p> REDUCTIO . So what Chaucer is saying through the Man of Law , and what the mentality patriarchy , in turn , is saying through Chaucer , is that the traffic in women is contiguous with the impulse to force Christianity upon a non-christian culture . Right ? <p> CEBES . Right . Marriage , in the story of Custance , is a means of acquiring new relatives the converted Syrians - and , more importantly , new colonies . <p> REDUCTIO . Maybe that 's correct , but - <p> THEA . Oh no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's vitally important to critique the oppression of women in all its forms , your method ignores history . No , that 's not quite right . You 've paid a lot of attention to the territorial ambitions of Christendom , but you 've failed to examine the lives of women in medieval Europe . But you already said that you 're skeptical about the value of using historical researching the reading of this text . <p> CEBES . I think you 've exaggerated the possibility of reconstructing its historical context . I simply want to suggest that all such reconstructions contain an element of revisionism and serve present interests - and that is n't a bad thing . <p> REDUCTIO . You say that patriarchal society - whatever that is - hinges upon the exchange of women among men , and you have suggested that women living in such a society have no choice but to behave like pliant commodities who receive no benefits from their own circulation . <p> CEBES . Yes , but my reading of the poem is also , if only implicitly , a commentary on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem provides me with an opportunity to grapple with things that matter now : my responsibility is to the present , not to Chaucer 's time . <p> REDUCTIO . Sure , but I think you 'll find that the poem is especially relevant to the present precisely because it offers an inaccurate representation of Chaucer 's Europe . The lives of Chaucer 's contemporaries most likely did not conform to the pattern which you 've found in his poem . Women in Chaucer 's England , and indeed throughout late medieval Europe , were neither passive nor pliant , and they were certainly not mere commodities . In fact , many women of the time earned their means of subsistence by producing and marketing their own goods . These women merchant-producers , not merchandise . They benefitted from the economy of exchange . They were creators , rather than objects , of value . <p> The household was the center of production in medieval Europe , and - <p> CASSANDRA . It sounds like we 're writing an essay - <p> REDUCTIO. - the members of each family worked together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the husband was , according to the law , the undisputed head of the household and , usually , the owner of the family property , he could not support himself or his dependents without his wife , who had skills which were indispensable to the processes of production . In the city and in the country a wife was her husband ' business partner , not his possession . <p> Take London in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , for example . Women worked there as traders just as men did , even though in theory a number of laws gave men control over economic matters . Women merchants marketed a variety of commodities in a variety of ways . Some were bakers ; some were hucksters who sold beer , food , and other small goods ; some were brokers , while others produced and sold cloth ; some , though not many , were involved in international trade . In fact , women dominated the silk weaving industry of medieval London to such an extent that they successfully petitioned the King , in 1368 , and the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition . Furthermore , the - <p> CASSANDRA . Now that you two have raised the question of responsibility , is n't it irresponsible to say that the women of medieval Europe did not suffer exploitation at the hands of men ? I 've read that the women merchants of fourteenth-century Exeter were involved in low-status work like petty retailing because the men who dominated the local economy deliberately kept them from practicing more lucrative and prestigious trades , such as wholesaling . Nor should we forget all the everyday violence : battering , incest , and rape - a word you all seem reluctant to hear ... <p> REDUCTIO . Well ... sure ... but I want to emphasize that women in Chaucer 's world lacked neither skill nor business acumen and that they found ways to overcome social constraints and compete with men on an equal footing . Women were thwarted by patriarchy , but they were not all so passive as dame Custance . <p> Of course , Custance is a member of the nobility , and you might argue that , in the Middle Ages , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute to the family 's wealth . Her role might well have been bound up with the transfer of property . But there is evidence to suggest that even the gentlewomen of Chaucer 's time took part in managing the economy of the aristocratic household . So the question to ask is why stories like " The Man of Law 's Tale " represent fictional women who are so unlike the women who actually lived in late medieval Europe , particularly northern Europe . <p> CEBES . These comments have damaged my argument , but I 'm pleased to see that you 're not reducing the text to a mere reflection of the era that produced it . <p> CASSANDRA . It 's too bad that you - <p> REDUCTIO . I disagree . I think our arguments share a common theme . They complement rather than contradict each other . We have all in our own ways tried to show that " The Man of Law 's Tale " articulates a set of ideas and practices which belong not to Chaucer , but to his social formation . What we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coherent reading of the poem ... <p> CASSANDRA . No , you just want to cover up these contradictions because you ca n't tolerate incoherence . It would be just like you to organize Chaucer 's poem around a central point because you always want unity instead of difference . Why ca n't you simply accept the fact that you arguments have come unravelled ? Since the world is complex , why simplify things just to make them fit the rhetorical model of the unified essay ? <p> CEBES . Because we ca n't resist the desire to wrap our discussion around an organizing theme . Besides , you 're taking us back to the notion that the text should mirror the world , but we 're arguing that texts make worlds . <p> REDUCTIO . I agree . Without a central thesis , this talk would lack a critical thrust . <p> CEBES . That 's two against one : let 's bring this talk to a head . <p> REDUCTIO . We can begin by reviewing what we 've said so far . I suggested that the poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then Thea said the poem is the product of a patriarchy ; that led Cebes to note that an ambition to expand the borders of Christendom underlies the story . Clearly , we all believe that the poem has something to do with the distribution of power in the Middle Ages.CASSANDRA . That 's not much common ground . And you have n't defined power yet . <p> THEA . You three have given me another idea ... Maybe " The Man of Law 's Tale " articulates a western European desire to control the world by forcing it to revolve around Latin Christianity . After listening to you guys , I 'm tempted to call this a typically male desire . Anyway , the fulfillment of this desire to place Christendom at the center of things requires both the suppression of women and the colonization of non-Christian cultures . Now I ca n't say that everyone in medieval Europe felt the desire to be at the center , just as we can no longer be so quick to assume that medieval women were simply commodities who has no control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a single period . Nevertheless , the desire for centrality must have been available in the Middle Ages , because it has worked its way - <p> CASSANDRA . How do you know that this desire , as you call it , existed outside of medieval texts ? Maybe the writers who recorded the various versions of the story - Trivet , Chaucer , Gower - were working within a purely literary convention that had been established long before they began to write . Maybe they were just following the rules of a genre . <p> THEA . Maybe . But you 're begging the question . Even if I agreed with what you say , I would still have to explain why such a genre was circulating through medieval England in the First place . I would still have to investigate the desire to make Christendom into a center of control . But what I want to argue right now is that when the Christians attempt to make the world revolve around the Latin Church , they are in fact trying to center the world around a system which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idealizing the decentered text . <p> THEA . Then maybe I should put my comments into context . It 's commonly assumed that in the Middle Ages Latin Christians saw both nature and history as books where things and events were a form of symbolic communication from God to humanity . Their world was a great text , not a system of causes and effects governed by laws of nature . The Man of Law , for example - <p> CEBES . I 'm not convinced that what you say would apply to every Latin Christian - <p> THEA . You 're probably right . Anyway , if you take a look at the poem - right here , for example - you 'll see that the Man of Law describes the night sky as a " large book " ( II.190 ) in which the history of the human race is recorded : " in the sterres , " he says , " clerer than is glas , /Is writen , God woot , whoso koude it rede , /The deeth of every man , withouten drede " ( II.194-6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of signs . More importantly , God is the center of this system because all signs ultimately refer back to him , so the he - <p> REDUCTIO . What does this have to do with out friend Custance ? <p> THEA . She is one of these signs . She represents God 's omnipotence . " God liste , " says the Man of Law , " to shewe his wonderful myracle/In hire , for we sholde seen his myghty werkis " ( II.477-8 ) . Like all the signs in the book of the world , she is given the job of showing God because god himself , the center of the Christian world , is missing and can only become present through his symbols . God supplements his absence with dame Custance . She is his substitute . <p> CEBES . What proof do you have that Custance is a sign ? And why does it matter ? <p> THEA . It matters to the Man of Law : he says that his tale teaches a lesson Christian morality . But because Custance is a particularly complicated sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control . Now wait while I explain myself . <p> CEBES . I 'm always waiting . <p> THEA . Signs not only represent meanings , but also disseminate them . One of Custance 's roles is to disseminate the so-called good news of Christianity throughout the non-Christian countries which lie on the borders of Christendom . She is born in Rome , the seat of the Latin Church and geographical center of Christianity . No , that 's not right . Jerusalem is the true geographical center of the Latin world , but it lies outside the borders of Christian Europe . Rome is actually a substitute for the center . Anyway , Custance spends her youth at Rome in the transplanted heart of Christendom , but when she is ready to marry , she moves out to the supposedly pagan frontiers of Europe , where her job is to spread the Christian faith . Now , I have already - <p> CEBES . The play of her name is worth noting too : Constance , Custance , Couste ... But Rome was n't the only place that claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of her story , probably sometime around 1390 . The French popes had resided at Avignon for most of the fourteenth century , and after the Schism of the 1370s there were popes in both Rome and Avignon . Rome was n't restored as the sole center of a battered papacy until after Chaucer 's death . If his poem is an allegory , then maybe the travels of dame Custance have something to do with the wandering of the seat of the Church during the 1300s . <p> THEA . Interesting point ... But as I was saying , her betrothal to the Sultan is designed to bring about the conversion of the Syrians . Only the drastic action of the Sultan 's mother , the Sultaness , prevents them from adopting Christianity . When she learns that her son wants his people to renounce Islam so that he can wed a Latin bride , the Sultaness resolves to resist his plan at all costs . " The lyfshal rather out of my body sterte , " she declares , " Or Makometes lawe out of myn herte ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bride , the groom , and their entourage , and then has her followers slaughter everyone in attendance - everyone , that is , except Custance . " The Sowdan and the Cristen everichone/Been al tohewe and stiked at the bord , /But it were oonly dame Custance allone " ( II.429-31 ) . <p> REDUCTIO . Why do you think Custance is saved ? <p> THEA . She is spared so that she can continue to function as God 's sign . <p> That , at least , is what the Man of Law says : Men myghten asken why she was nat slayn Eek at the feeste ? who mighte hir body save ? And I answere to that demande agayn , Who saved Danyel in the horrible cave There every wight save he , maister and knave , Was with the leon frete er he asterte ? No wight but God , that he bar in his herte . ( II.470-6 ) <p> Custance 's escape demonstrates to the Man of Law 's audience that his god is powerful enough and merciful enough to rescue her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She signifies that this god looks after those who believe in him - those who bear him in their hearts . <p> When the followers of the Sultaness put Custance in a boat and set her adrift on the Sea , the movement of signification is repeated . Custance again survives and , by doing so , signifies God 's benevolence : Who kepte hire fro the drenchyng in the see ? Who kepte Jonas in the fisshes mawe Til he was spouted up at Nynyvee ? Wel may men knowe it was no wight but he That kepte peple Ebrayk from hir Drenchynge , With drye feet thurghout the see passynge . ( II.485-90 ) <p> Custance is actually just one sign in a series of signs which includes Daniel , Jonas , and the people of Israel crossing out of Egypt . All of these figures are saved from some peril through God 's intervention , and they all point to the same simple lesson . Their stories are allegories which remind a Christian audience that they too have been saved . God is that " wight " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who sent his son to redeem humanity from eternal damnation by suffering and dying on the cross . <p> CASSANDRA . Faith is profitable . <p> CEBES . But then why do n't Chaucer 's Syrians adopt Christianity ? Why do n't they just read Custance 's escape and see that the Christian faith has its benefits ? <p> THEA . It seems that in " The Man of Law 's Tale " Christianity can not take root in a place where women refuse to be pliant . When the Sultaness thwarts the Christians ' plan to acquire land and converts , she does so by aggressively rebelling against the authority of the patriarch who rule her society - the Sultan , her son . Since she refuses to submit to " mannes governance , " the Sultaness represents everything that is repulsive to the Christian mentality . " O Sowdanesse , roote of iniquitee , " says the Man of Law , " O feyned womman , al that may confounde/Vertu and innocence , thurgh thy malice , /Is bred in thee " ( II.358 and 362-4 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virtue and innocence of the passive dame Custance . According to the Man of Law , this unwomanly woman must be the " instrument " ( II.370 ) of Christendom 's greatest adversary : Satan . She is the devil who keeps Syria from falling into Christian hands . <p> After Custance is expelled from the East , she sails around for several years - <p> CASSANDRA . Do n't forget that at one point some guy tries to RAPE her . <p> THEA. - until she finally arrives in Britain , which has recently been conquered by a non-Christian people : " In al that lond no Cristen dorste route ; /Alle Cristen folk been fled fro that contree/Thurgh payens , that conquereden al about " ( II.540-3 ) . In Britain as in Syria Custance 's role , as sign , is to disseminate Latin Christianity , and though she has failed in her original mission to convert the Syrians , she succeeds in spreading the word of God among the Britons . The Man of Law tells us that with the help of a miracle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another in that place - /Converted was " ( II.684-6 ) . <p> Predictably , the only person who hinders the conversion of Britain is the king 's mother , Donegild . She forges letters which cause God 's sign , dame Custance , to be sent back to sea in her boat . Like the Sultaness , Donegild is a sort of matriarch who actively resists the intrusion of the word of the Christian God into a non-Christian territory , and like the Sultaness , her actions earn her the Man of Law 's contempt : O Donegild , I ne have noon Englissh digne Unto thy malice and thy tirannye ! And therefore to the feed I thee resigne ; Lat him enditen of thy traitorie ! Fy , mannysh , fy ! - o nay , by God , I lye - Fy feendlich spirit , for I dar wel telle , Though thou heere walke , thy spirit is in helle ! ( II.778-84 ) <p> Since Donegild refuses to stand by passively and watch as her people give up their religion , she is yet another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is either " mannysh " - a man in a woman 's body - or " feendlich " - a devil in human form . <p> An active and empowered woman has no legitimacy within the Christian framework of " The Man of Law 's Tale , " and so the conversion can not be entirely successful until Donegild is dead . Curiously enough , it is her son , King Alla , who eventually kills her , clearing the way for the dissemination of Christianity . In fact , this murder creates an intimate bond between England and Rome , the seat of the Latin Church , for when Alla travels to Rome as a penance for killing his own mother , he brings England into the Christian fold and entrusts himself and his subjects to " the Popes ordinance " ( II.992 ) . The elimination of womanly aggression draws England into the Christian orbit . All this mother-bashing leads me to suggest - <p> CEBES . Wait a minute . You 're saying that Custance is sent out from Italy to draw the East into Christendom and although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconstant she manages to convert the English and make England which is really a substitute for the East revolve around Rome which is actually a substitute for Jerusalem even though Christianity has no center because its god is absent and can only become present through his substitute namely Custance ? <p> THEA . Confusing , is n't it ? Christendom can only make Rome the center of the world by imposing **26;234;TOOLONG on the women of non-Christian cultures : women are signs who gain nothing from their own perlocutionary force . But this attempt to center the world around the Roman church begins to seem paradoxical when you realize that Rome is not the real center of Christendom and that Christianity itself is a decentered religion . And as you pointed out , Rome and Avignon had established themselves as competing centers of the papacy towards the end of Chaucer 's life , so there was in fact a proliferation of popes and points of papal authority - <p> CEBES . But I 'd like to return to an idea we raised earlier but never dealt with . <p> CASSANDRA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chaucer 's time took a very active role in the European market economy , why does the Man of Law present Custance as a mere commodity who is traded but can not trade , and why does he condemn women who refuse to be passive ? Why is there such a gap between the way women were and the way they are portrayed in the story of Custance ? <p> THEA . That 's three questions , and I wo n't answer any of them . <p> REDUCTIO . I have a theory which might help , thought it 's mere speculation . <p> CEBES . But then we 'll never find a focal point for this discussion - <p> CASSANDRA . He 's going to tell us anyway . <p> REDUCTIO . Like all my ideas , this theory is really not my own , but it allows me to make a connection between the portrayal of women in " The Man of Law 's Tale " and the status of women in the market economy of Chaucer 's time . As we said , the economic order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including high labor-status . Now , people gain high labor-status when , as workers , they gather their own raw materials and supplies and control the distribution of whatever they produce . In the Middle Ages , the women and men who managed family economies had high labor-status because they jointly controlled their household 's resources of production and distribution . Anyone who enjoyed this status , moreover , had a distinct advantage over their competitors in the marketplace because people with high labor-status produced more and therefore earned more . High labor-status brought wealth , privilege , and power to high-status laborers . <p> Still , I 've read that women traders who controlled their own means of production and distribution were a threat to the men who dominated not just the economy , but the laws and the governments of medieval Europe . When these women gained privileged positions in the marketplace , they acquired - <p> CEBES . Do n't you think that no you 're going too far in trying to link this tale to its world ? <p> REDUCTIO. - authority within their communities : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on culture and politics as well . They usurped men 's positions and aroused their fears and hostilities . Before long the patriarchal order moved to limit their power by transferring work which granted high labor-status out of the household - and out of the control of women traders . <p> My theory is that " The Man of Law 's Tale " is part of this general project to discredit women and drive them out of positions of power in the market economy . It is one of many literary artifacts of the late Middle Ages which arose from the struggle to reinforce the patriarchal order . These artifacts attempt to disempower women by misrepresenting them . <p> I said earlier that " The Man of Law 's Tale " is a mode of discourse which makes a world without merchants unthinkable ; I have since realized that the poem makes women 's participation in trade equally unthinkable . This theory explains why the narrative tells its audience that any woman who claims to be really valuable , like Custance , must behave as a passive commodity rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the story were trying to put women into roles that do n't threaten men 's control over the medieval economy . This theory also explains why the Man of Law declares that active , aggressive women are both devilish and unwomanly . By condemning women who resist the desires of men , he encourages his audience to think that women are not permitted to question male authority - let alone rebel against it . If discourse is a way of using words to make worlds , then in " The Man of Law 's Tale " Chaucer creates a world where " mannes governance " is a natural part of the order of things , including the market economy . <p> CEBES . But Chaucer is merely the Channel - <p> CASSANDRA . - through which a particular discourse or mentality speaks . Sure . But I 'm beginning to think that our notion of the author as the channel of class interests is a bad idea . <p> THEA . You 'd rather ignore the social fact and couch everything in terms of the individuals ? <p> CASSANDRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't responsible for what they write . I think they should be held accountable for their ideas , especially the patriarchs . <p> THEA . But patriarchy is n't the work of an individual . And you said that we never bothered to define it properly in the first place . <p> CASSANDRA . You ca n't avoid questions of agency and accountability by invoking some sort of Gestalt . And you are the one who did n't define patriarchy-in-general , remember ? <p> CEBES . I like this theory . Maybe you could work it into a paper sometime - <p> THEA . I 'm not so sure . It leaves too many questions unanswered . <p> CASSANDRA . That 's strange , because it seems to me that all of your questions point back to a single problem . <p> THEA . How interesting . Do n't you think it 's time to go ? <p> CASSANDRA . Believe me , I was gone a long time ago . But have n't you noticed that your arguments keep banging up against the same problem ? Whether we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steal territory from other men or men trying to drive women from a market economy - no matter what we seem to talk about , we always come back to the fact that men beat up on women . It may be necessary to put a poem back into its social and historical context before you can read it effectively , but I ca n't help thinking that the sort of violence I 'm talking about cuts across all contexts . For me there 's no mystery in the fact that Alla kills his mother : men kill women all the time , especially women they know well . They also rape women all the time . It 's the norm . After Custance is banished from Britain , thanks to Donegild 's scheming , she sails around for five years and finally reaches land , and guess what happens ? I 'll tell you if I can get my hands on that book ... <p> REDUCTIO . Here you go . But I have to leave soon . I 'm already late . <p> THEA . Do n't go without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But not yet . Because look , as soon as Custance 's boat hits dry ground near a castle , she is immediately assaulted : that very night " A theef ... /Cam into the ship allone , and seyde he sholde/Hir lemman be , wher she wolde or nolde " ( II.915-17 ) . But what really interests me about this episode is that Custance says a feeble prayer to the Virgin ... and then pushes the guy into the water where he drowns . <p> REDUCTIO . Hmph ... I must admit that kind of man-hating rhetoric makes me a little uncomfortable ... <p> CASSANDRA . In case you have n't noticed , I 'm talking about a form of woman-hating . And it spans the history of that weird thing we politely call western culture - did n't I just hear a woman 's voice asking for a ride home ? And why does she think that ride is safe ? Safety does not reside in the familiar . Anyway , I ca n't help thinking that the real connection we should have been looking for in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain form of white male and European heterosexuality . But you probably think that 's farfetched . <p> CEBES . Maybe you could work it into a paper ? <p> CASSANDRA . Impossible . I work five days a week , seven if you include the kids . Where would I find the time ? <p> THEA . Why are you people always making women out to be victims ? Anyway , you really should 've said this before . It 's not fair to criticize our talk after its over . <p> REDUCTIO . It 's too late now . We have to go . <p> CEBES . Me too . Do you need a ride ? <p> CASSANDRA . No thanks . I usually walk .
