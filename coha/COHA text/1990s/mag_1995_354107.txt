AFTER A WEEK IN ISOLATION IN MOScow 's Central Clinical Hospital , Boris Yeltsin finally made a public appearance , of sorts , last week . The Russian President , who was hospitalized two weeks ago for the second time in just over three months for what was described as " an insufficiency of oxygenated blood to the heart , " showed up on the evening news in a 40-sec. video clip produced by the Kremlin . Dressed in a blue , green and white track suit , the pale , puffy-faced President sat slumped in a chair next to Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin . In a slurred speech , Yeltsin explained that he " was n't feeling too bad " and considered himself " out of danger . " But the public-relations ploy did little to allay suspicions about the true state of the President 's health . For many Russians , it recalled the early 1980s , when the successive deaths of Soviet leaders Leonid Brezhnev , Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko were all preceded by assurances from the Kremlin that they were in fine fettle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least until the end of the month and follow that with two weeks of convalescence at a sanatorium . The U.S. has made a very private offer of medical assistance but so far has received no response . As next in line for the presidency , Chernomyrdin has been careful to affirm that Yeltsin remains fully in charge even while hospitalized . Still , the Defense and Interior ministers , together with the chiefs of the security services  --  the crucial power ministers , as they are called  --  as well as the Foreign Minister , have been reporting directly to the Prime Minister . <P> After close to 10 turbulent years of reform , Russians also have serious doubts that their country 's young democratic institutions can weather a transfer of power . Yeltsin 's unfinished scheme to create a presidential republic has resulted in a state as fragile as the health of its chief executive . Unresolved constitutional questions remain about how the country 's two-tier parliament should be formed . Although Russians will be going to the polls on Dec. 17 to elect deputies to the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been decided whether the Federation Council , the upper house , should be a forum of regional leaders or senators elected directly by the people . <P> Now that Yeltsin 's future is clouded , next month 's vote looms even larger on the political calendar . The Russian Communist Party is leading in public-opinion polls and could forge a solid majority against Yeltsin 's reforms , if it joins forces with the Congress of Russian Communities , the party of General Alexander Lebed , whose patriotic views have made him the most popular candidate nationally . Yet currently the Communists seem to find this proposition far more enticing than Lebed , who has described his potential partners as " kind of slippery . " <P> With a weakened President , a new legislature packed with opposition deputies might be emboldened to win back powers lost in October 1993 when Yeltsin used the army to bring rebellious deputies into line . It will also enjoy constitutional protection from presidential dissolution for the first six months of its term . Presidential elections are now set for June 1996 , and the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Lebed , Communist Party leader Gennadi Zyuganov and ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
