" It is fitting that we should hold the young in awe . "  --  Confucius // Light showers , known to the Chinese as plum rain , fell during the night , but they did nothing to relieve the sweltering temperatures that , on this July Sunday , will make Taipei , Taiwan , the hottest city in East Asia . It 's early yet , just past eight in the morning , but already the heat has come in waves to Taipei Stadium , and so have the fathers . They are a sport-shirted , discomforted lot , pacing , puffing feverishly on cigarettes , perspiring freely and proselytizing furiously . To amplify their thoughts on themes ranging from how to throw a slider to how to hit one , some of them have seen fit to put on gloves and pick up baseballs . Receiving their throws are their sons , small boys in red-white-and-blue uniforms who keep a respectful silence , throw harder than their papas and hit nothing but ringing line drives when they are called for batting practice . // You would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hours these boys could be national heroes . Theirs is the uniform of the Da Ruan Primary School baseball team , from the city of Taichung , and at nine they will take on Li-Jen Primary School , from Tainan , to determine the Taiwanese Little League champion and , in effect , the best team of 11- and 12-year-old baseball players on earth . // True , there would still be the Far East championship in early August in Guam , against teams from six other Asian countries , and then , should the Taiwanese team win there , the eight-team Little League World Series from Aug. 20 to 24 in Williamsport , Pa . But in more years than not , the Sunday morning game in Taipei has offered Taiwanese players their stiffest challenge . In the 21 years Taiwan has participated in Little League baseball , teams from this island slightly larger than Maryland , with a population ( 20 million ) that is less than a sixth of Japan 's , have won the World Series 14 times . In the 1990 final , the San-Hua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to give Taiwan its fourth win in the past five years . // " At the time , I felt those American kids do n't play seriously , " says Wu Chunliang , 17 , who shut out Tucson 12-0 in the ' 86 final . " They do n't concentrate . They 're having fun . We really play baseball . It comes from ourselves . If we lose , there must have been something wrong . " // At Taipei Stadium the children remain utterly composed amid the heat  --  paternal and otherwise  --  even as they exchange bows with their opponents and begin the game of a lifetime . Not so self-possessed are their fans , many of whom awakened before daybreak to drive the two hours from Taichung or the four hours from Tainan . With Taichung righthander Pan Chia-chen 's first pitch they begin waving flags , whistling , singing , chanting niceties like " Shieh ! " ( " You 're finished ! " ) and banging on the two huge red Chinese drums carted in for the occasion . // Chia-chen is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countenance that he retains even after Tainan takes a quick 2-0 lead . When Chia-chen retakes the mound to open the second inning , however , it becomes apparent why he has won every one of the 20-odd games he has pitched for Da Ruan over the past year . Mixing curves that break like hearts with a 75-mph fastball , he begins disposing of Tainan hitters in bunches . Through four innings Chia-chen has nine strikeouts. // With the game tied 2-2 in the fifth , Taichung 's muscular shortstop , Tsen Tse-fang , hits the ball so hard to left that it wedges into the chain-link fence and he is halted at second with a ground rule double . Chia-chen fouls off two bunt attempts  --  " Ta-ma-deh ! " ( " Bull  --   --  ! " ) scorn the fans  --  and hits a grounder to the right side that moves Tse-fang over and lands Chia-chen safe when the Tainan first baseman is handcuffed . Chia-chen steals second on the next pitch and then follows Tse-fang across the plate on catcher Lin Chung-chun 's single up the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , " says an elderly Tainan fan , who pulls out chopsticks and tucks in to a box of cold noodles. // Not quite . In the sixth and final inning , with a Tainan runner on first and nobody out , Chia-chen fields a ground ball and fires to Tse-fang , who gets the force at second but is prevented from turning the double play by the base runner , who comes in spikes high . Tse-fang throws the ball down , hitting the Tainan player in the back , and then collapses in pain . Eventually he is helped to his feet , and he stays in the game . A murmur of disgust courses through the stands . Drums beat ominously , but Chia-chen is unfazed . He takes care of the last two batters himself , and the Taichung side of the stadium explodes in a blaze of firecrackers. // Taichung 's coach , a slight , wiry man with thick glasses named Chang Chun-rang , is festooned with flowers and tossed in the air by his players . Tse-fang is led over to the Tainan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You were rude ! Apologize ! " they scream at him . " You must say you are sorry . " Tse-fang dutifully shakes hands with the Tainan base runner , and the fans burst into applause . Tse-fang then rejoins his teammates , who are posing together for photographs behind a silken blue banner emblazoned with a golden dragon , the ancient Chinese symbol of strength and prosperity . // Taiwan has become one of the world 's wealthiest nations by transforming itself from a tropical afterthought into an island of industry . Modern riches came with strict attendance to ancient principles , most prominently The Analects of Confucius , the revered moralist who died in 479 B.C. and is taught in every Taiwanese school . " Being good as a son and obedient as a young man is , perhaps , the root of a man 's character , " said the Master . // Such discipline and the Confucian ideal of merit , which says that anyone can achieve success if he works hard enough , have much to do with the Taiwanese children 's eminence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is that our kids are more obedient and diligent , " said Hsieh Kuocheng , the father of Taiwan Little League , in 1977 . At Da Ruan Primary School , which went on to win the Far East championship to qualify for the Little League World Series , the players practice several hours a day , month after month . Everybody participates in flip drills , runs laps around the field , shags during batting practice and never , ever fusses. // But what becomes of them later ? What happens to these extraordinary youngsters when they outgrow their Little League jerseys ? In fact , their branch roads have been many . // Baseball was brought to Taiwan by the Japanese , who occupied the island for 50 years beginning in 1895 . But as anyone in Taiwan can tell you , the country 's baseball tradition really started in 1968 , when a team of aborigine children from the town of Red Leaf , in the maple-dappled mountains outside the city of Taitung , swept three games from Wakayama , the world champion Japanese Little League team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . The Taiwanese were ecstatic . The conquerors had been vanquished by a group of young players descended from the island 's first inhabitants . // The next year Taiwan sent its own team to Williamsport . The Golden Dragons , largely stocked with aborigine players , brought the island its first championship in any kind of international athletic competition . Upon their return , these poor mountain children , who had learned to play the game by hitting peach pits with bats they fashioned from the branches of guava trees , were treated to an eight-hour victory parade in Taipei and an audience with President Chiang Kai-shek. // Sitting in a cramped , musty house down an alley two blocks from Taitung Prison , Yu Hong-kai , the Red Leaf and Golden Dragon third baseman of those years and the only person to play for both teams , is clutching the youngest of his three sons in one cabbage-sized palm and a Long Life Mild cigarette in the other . " We had only one pair of sport shoes , " says Yu , " and could wear them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barefoot that often we 'd just take off our shoes when we played competitions . Many jokes were made about us . The first time we went to Taipei , the whole village stopped work to bid us farewell . The people killed a pig , and everyone gathered in a circle and sang and danced . The next day we walked 10 miles before we could get a ride to Taipei . " In the ' 69 championship game against Santa Clara , Calif. , Yu had two hits and scored twice . His teammates called him the Lucky Player . // Today Yu , 35 , is a warden at Taitung Prison . The work affords him and his family a modest life , and Yu projects a facade of reasonable contentment . " It 's a good job , " he says . " I 've had it for 10 years , and it would be a pity to throw it away . " Yet later he says , " I do n't like it . There 's no future for me . I 'd like to coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yu amuses himself by hunting for flying squirrels in the hills with a bow and arrow and by playing catch with his sons . He misses baseball , but for someone of his generation , the game did n't hold much future . Taiwan had no professional baseball  --  only a few adult leagues sponsored by large companies . Parents urged their children to concentrate on finding a profession . Yu did . He is a civil servant , and thus more fortunate than most aborigines , who still live in mountain hovels , farming corn and rice or , like Yu 's friend , former Red Leaf shortstop Cho Du-shun , driving a taxi . // Taiwan remains stratified , a place where the Confucian belief in the obligation of the privileged to support the downtrodden has n't always squared with Mandarin contempt for non-Chinese ethnic groups . The aborigines , who total less than 2% of Taiwan 's population , were pushed out to the inhospitable mountains by the Chinese and ridiculed for their ceremonial feathers , witch doctors , superstitions and odd languages . Before his games , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the cloth for luck . // " Mainlanders look down on the Taiwanese , the Taiwanese-look down on the aborigines , and the aborigines kick the dogs , " says Dorothy Ko , who teaches Chinese history at UC San Diego . It was fitting that the first champions were from Red Leaf . Merit had come to those who worked hard for it . // Riches have come to Ko Yuan-tsu , 35 , an aborigine who pitched the penultimate victory for the Golden Dragons at Williamsport in 1969 . Today he pitches for the Nagoya Dragons in Japan 's top professional league . Each Japanese team is permitted two foreign players , and until last year , when Ko became a Japanese citizen , he lived the outsider 's life in Japan . Foreigners , and especially other Asians , are often regarded coolly in Japan . " Talking about discrimination , " says Ko , " mental toughness counts in Taiwan , and it counts here . In Taiwan if a Taiwanese plays at the same level as me , they 'd play the Taiwanese . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I feel discrimination , but my philosophy is , You look down on me , I 'll change your mind . " So he has . Since joining Nagoya , a traditionally weak franchise , in 1981 , he has won 83 games against 75 losses , with a 3.20 ERA. // Ko took his 94-mph fastball north because Japan offered a superior level of competition and better financial opportunities than Taiwanese company teams . He grew up in a one-room grass hut with his parents , four brothers and two sisters . Today he earns $700,000 a year . " We had a lot of rice to eat , " he says of his childhood . " Nothing else . I have always really wanted to help my mom and dad , and now all that 's taken care of . " // Ko remains a hero in Taiwan , where some fans display baseballs bearing his signature in glass cases beside pieces of Ming pottery . However , in many ways he has left Taiwan behind him . He is married to a former Miss Japan contestant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to speak Japanese well . " I feel that since I 'm here , " he says , " I have to blend in. " // Also playing in Japan are two other Taiwanese players , the handsome Tokyo Giants slugger Lu Ming-tsu , 26 , and Seibu Lions pitcher Kuo Tai-yuan , 29 , a spindly , hawk-eyed man who throws close to 100 mph . Over the years many of the best Taiwanese players have been members of lower-level Japanese teams , and one of them , Tan Shin-ming , was loaned to the Class A Fresno ( Calif . ) Giants for the 1974 season , thus becoming the only Taiwanese to play pro baseball in the U.S. " He was sort of like Luis Tiant because he twisted and turned when he delivered the ball , " says Boston Red Sox designated hitter Jack Clark , who was Tan 's teammate in Fresno . " He was a very good pitcher . I thought we 'd go up through the minors together , but I never saw him after that year . " // Tan went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best professional season . Today he has a job in a recent venture whose very existence has brought hope to young baseball players all over Taiwan . Tan is managing the Mercuries Tigers in this , the second year of the Chinese Taipei Professional Baseball League . // In 1984 Hong Ton-son , the owner of the five-star Brother Hotel in Taipei , placed an advertisement in most of the city 's 20 daily newspapers . Hong , a respected businessman and a bit of an eccentric , was seeking players for the Brother Hotel team , which he was forming to compete in the most elite of the corporate leagues . His pitch to prospective players was the following : This year , our team . In three years , our own stadium . Five years after that , professional baseball . // The message met with general opposition . It was well for Hong to form a team if he liked , and fine if he thought he could afford a stadium  --  land in Taiwan was going for about $300,000 an acre  --  but professional baseball ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspapers , " says Hong . " They felt we did n't have enough players , that our facilities were very poor . Nobody wanted to see change . But we used to have 300 Little League teams , and now there were 30 . This was because there was no future . Players could not live on the small salary of a player on the national team . In fact , the only way to save amateur baseball was to promote professional baseball . We had to make a dream for them . " // Pro baseball seemed a natural in a country where the youngsters were so skilled and the fans so passionate that millions of them arose several nights in succession at 3 a.m. to watch Little League tournament games televised from Pennsylvania . But powerful political voices said otherwise . Taiwan feared public humiliation . Except for C.K . Yang 's silver medal in the 1960 Olympic decathlon , Taiwan 's experience in international adult athletic competition had been one of unrelenting failure . The Olympic baseball team , however , provided reason for optimism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1984 Los Angeles Games , and many Taiwanese worried that , in the words of P.P. Tang , president of the island 's Broadcasting Corporation of China and director of Taiwan 's Amateur Baseball Association , " if you have professional baseball , you do n't have the players for amateur competition in which our country 's flag is displayed . " // Yet Hong , 52 , has always been ruled more by passion than by convention . In a Taiwan that has become a land of cupidity , his tastes are austere ; in a country that prizes conformity , he is unabashedly sentimental . He owns no car , preferring the anonymity of taxicabs . On his wrist is the tarnished watch his father gave him almost 40 years ago . Instead of a briefcase he carries a khaki schoolbag that he bought as a college freshman . Confucius said , " Extravagance means ostentation , frugality means shabbiness : I would rather be shabby than ostentatious . " Hong feels the same way , except when it comes to baseball . // He has adored the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the morning of the youngest 's wedding , all of them were sitting in their father 's house wondering what to do with themselves until the evening ceremony . Hong proposed a baseball game , found a field , rounded up 13 more players and later received the tongue-lashing of his life when the groom took a pop fly in the glasses and went to the altar with stitches traversing his face . // Hong finished the stadium , earlier than advertised , in 1986 , and it is the most impressive ballpark on the island . Besides the handsome diamond , the complex includes an adjacent domed infield for evening and foul-weather practices , a dormitory , ample parking space , and a scoreboard imported from America . The stadium serves as the practice field of the Brother Elephants , Hong 's professional team , and as the site of the company game Hong holds each Tuesday for all interested hotel employees . " In our hotel , " says Hong , " we emphasize teamwork , and I encourage teamwork by bringing our employees to play baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The real reason hotel workers , aged 18 to 62 , trundle out to the field is that the boss loves to play . He pitches , in full uniform , and his side usually wins . // Although Taiwanese Little League teams continued to fare well in Williams-port through the ' 80s , interest in youth baseball was subsiding at an alarming pace . This and several other factors  --  including Hong 's conviction that professional baseball would reap a tidy profit in publicity alone for companies that sponsored teams ; the shrewd appointment of Tang as commissioner of the professional league ; and the stipulation that teams limit their rosters to players 24 years or older , thus assuaging concerns about a depleted national amateur team for the Olympics  --  led to the creation of a four-team pro circuit . // " Mr. Hong came to us and explained what he wanted to achieve , " says Michael Chen , vice-president of the Mercuries Corp . and general manager of the Tigers . " You know how well our children play . It 's a pity we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected . What he says is the hand on the Bible . " // Chen believes that the acceptance of pro baseball was symptomatic of a new ease of mind among the Taiwanese people . They had worked so hard that now , perhaps , it was time to enjoy life a little . " The rate of saving here makes us wealthy , " Chen says . " We made money , but we did n't spend it . People never even kept it in a bank . They kept it under the bed . In our history , people have been busy just making it from hand to mouth . I think this is the era for people to consider something besides work and three meals a day . In baseball , people have finally found a public activity that appeals to the whole community . The spirit to fight . The spirit to work together as a team . The spirit not to surrender . The spirit of harmony . I can see a lot of virtues in the sport , and that 's why so quickly I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , so popular are the Mercuries Tigers , Wei-Chuan Dragons , President Lions and Brother Elephants that Taiwan can not imagine what it hesitated about . Wu Ching-ho left a reporter 's job at the prestigious China Times of Taiwan to begin Pro-Baseball BiWeekly . " Everybody said , ' Mr. Wu , you 're crazy , ' " recalls Wu gleefully . " But I knew professional baseball would be successful in Taiwan . But I did n't know how fast ! It 's a miracle ! So many crowds ! " // The Chinese Taipei Professional League 's 90-game season runs from March to October . Last year more than 800,000 fans attended games , and this year the total may reach 1.2 million . In the past , 30,000 fans would turn out for the Little League championship game in Taipei . This year , although admission was free , perhaps 2,000 attended . " Now that we have professional baseball , they all want to watch that , " says a Little League official sadly . The papers are full of pro baseball , star players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rooftop batting cages . As a result , the island now has more than 400 Little League teams . Two additional pro franchises are planned for 1994. // " I always felt I must be brave , and now I feel very happy , " says Hong . " In my life I 've spent 400 million new Taiwan dollars $15 million , or maybe it 's 500 million , on baseball . I do n't mind . I wanted to make something for the society . " // Taiwan 's " Mr. Baseball , " Li Gee-ming , 33 , is having the worst season of his lengthy career . His back is aching , and so is his batting average , which only recently cracked .250 . Still , everything Li , who plays centerfield for the Elephants , does meets with cheers from Brother fans , who throw firecrackers at other players with such statistics . " We call Li Gee-ming ' Mr. Baseball ' because he has always represented our country , " says Wu . " He played on the Little League national team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the Big League national team 16 to 18 . Like Nolan Ryan he loves his family , loves his wife . He 's a gentleman . He got the most All-Star votes from the fans last year . " // " He is very gentle , he never argues with other people , " says She Rue-yu , a reporter for the Min Sheng Daily News . " When he stands in the batter 's box and is called out , he says nothing . He bows and goes back to the dugout . If a player 's average is not very high and he is a gentleman , the fans will like him . If he has a very high batting average and bad manners , some will say , ' He 's not a good player . ' When we are children , our parents teach us to be good , not to argue with anyone . When we grow up , we do n't argue with anybody , and we obey the umpire . " // If Li , a tall , tawny man , sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The fans gave me the title Mr. Baseball , " he says , " and there 's no particular reason except that I 've been playing all along . To me it 's a job . A career . I prefer pond fishing . Of course , my family is very important to me . By playing so much baseball , being away so much , it has been good for them , since it eliminated time for conflict . We cherish the moments when we are together . A lot of families split up when they are together a lot . They have time to quarrel and find fault with each other . " // Just as Americans are wont to do , Taiwanese baseball fans impose their social ideals on professional athletes . To be popular in Taiwan , a baseball player must possess a salutary character . As Confucius said , " If you set an example by being correct , who would dare to remain incorrect ? " But ballplayers can not always demonstrate such rectitude , so Taiwanese journalists have become adept at exaggerating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tiger infielder Dun Shing-shun , whose parents died before he was 18 , have been so filigreed as to make him a Taiwanese Horatio Alger . // The league is full of things that Americans are not accustomed to seeing . In the stands in Taipei , a banner reads : BASEBALL IS THE KIND OF SPORT THAT CAN EXERCISE YOUR BODY , YOUR CHARACTER AND YOUR WISDOM . IT CAN STABILIZE YOUR LIFE , AND THE ACHIEVEMENT IN BASEBALL IS NOT INFERIOR TO ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENT . Players who hit home runs receive stuffed replicas of their team 's mascot from a pretty girl as they cross home plate . Everyone shakes hands with the opposition after games and then bows to the fans . The fans , in turn , have been known to rain water bottles , soft-drink cans and stadium seats on players who displease them either with lousy play or , more likely , with hard slides , brushback pitches and other breaches of decorum . " Crazy people ! " says Wu . Alternatively , a player whose actions appeal to the fans ' sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floating down toward him . // Players can find playing in such an atmosphere terribly stressful . The Elephants ' strapping first baseman , Hwang Kwang-kwei , won last year 's batting title with a .342 average . Early this season he was shifted to third base and , worried that he would embarrass himself at an unfamiliar position , he hit in the low .200s . " I 'm really under pressure because of last year , " says Hwang . " I always feel I must change the game every time I hit . For two or three months I could n't hit . I lay in bed night after night , not sleeping . Gradually it gets better . " // Today Hwang is back at first base , and his average has improved to .263 . His wife , a former sprinter on the national track team , recently gave birth to the couple 's first child . " We do n't have a name for him yet , " said Hwang two weeks after his son was born . " We just call him Little Slugger. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be venerated . This can cause difficulties for players . The Lions ' Too Foo-ming , 32 , was one of Taiwan 's best pitchers until he hurt his elbow last season . Understandably , Too refuses to criticize his manager , a 50-year-old baseball traditionalist named Cheng Kun-chi . Too prefers to discuss matters more generally . " Old coaches do n't know how to protect the arms of their pitchers , " he says . " My experience was that last year I 'd start one game , relieve in the next and start again two days later . " // Too is hardly the only Taiwanese pitcher to have fallen victim to the tyranny of discipline . Dragon pitcher Joe Strong , a former minor leaguer from the U.S. ( because of a shortage of players , each of the four Taiwanese teams may carry five foreigners ) , describes the cruel fate of his teammate Li Chun-hong . " It about broke my heart , " says Strong . " He 's a lefthander . He had impeccable control , threw 92 mph . Last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 innings , no rest . Now he can barely break a plate of glass . He works his butt off , but his arm is dead . " // This year the Dragons have a new manager , Chu Shen-ming , the protg of Tiger manager Tan . Dragon and Tiger players say that these are managers who realize that adult men should not always be expected to play like 11-year-old boys . " I think the players who last are lucky , " says David Lick-yeung Wong , a Hong Kong native who is the Taiwan professional league 's only trainer . " I 've been in Taiwan six years , and our sports-medicine association is promoting the message that this is not the way to treat kids . But it takes time . Taiwan is a different world . " // Some aspects of contemporary Taiwanese cities  --  glittering karaoke ( sing-along ) parlors , French and Italian boutiques , expensive nightclubs fronted by life-sized steel palm trees or kitschy Egyptian sculptures , streets filled with German luxury cars and motorcylists wearing surgical masks to protect themselves against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of Confucius . The same is true for a number of Taiwan 's professional baseball players . Elephant pitcher Chen Yi-hsin , for instance , is known for his elaborate celebrations of strikeouts . " He lets you know , " says Strong . " The guys say , ' We smile here . ' " He points to his mouth . " ' We remember here . ' " He points to his heart . // Chen , 28 , pitched in Japan for a year before joining the Elephants . " As a boy , I studied more than I played sports , " he says . " That 's why I did n't hurt my arm . I hated baseball ! Now it 's for money . Game ! Finish ! Shower ! Girl ! I 'm a young man ! If you 're an old man , you can sleep , but I 'm single . I have girlfriends ! I drink beer ! I dance ! I 'm Chinese ! I sing karaoke very well ! " He 's also very fortunate in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season . // Some of the 11 Americans in the league say that the Taiwanese player who would have the best chance of making it to the U.S. majors is Too Hong-chin , a burly Tiger righthander with kinky curls who is called Train . " Bad boy ! " sighs Wu . " He 's like John McEnroe . This guy is really hot-tempered ! " // Too , 27 , has a 2.43 ERA , relies on a hard , sinking fastball and offers few changeups of any sort . " I have my own life and my own style , and being a gentleman is n't it , " he says . " I do n't have to be a gentleman . If I 'm rude , I intimidate the other team . I seldom smile when I pitch .

" I like to fish and hunt , " Too says . " For pretty ladies . " // Although most every player in the Chinese Taipei Professional Baseball League played Little League , the top level of professional play in Taiwan is vastly inferior to that of the U.S. Most pitchers do n't throw very hard , defense can be erratic , and home runs are scarce even though the ballparks are smaller than those in the States . Trouble is , after the rigorous Little League years , only the few boys who were groomed for the national team had much incentive to keep playing . But observers think matters will soon be different . // " Their biggest problem is that they do n't do it , " says Elephant shortstop Darrell Brown , an American who 's a former Minnesota Twin . " At age 12 they 're the best in the world , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pay until now , and parents here want their children to have a future . They 'll get a lot better . " // Matt Huff , an American designated hitter who has been handed nine stuffed dragons so far this season , feels that the Taiwanese pros have already made strides . " The caliber of baseball is decent , " says Huff . " They 've made vast improvements since last year . " // Some say that Taiwanese adults will never remind anyone of American ballplayers , simply because of their slighter builds . " Look at Roger Clemens , look at us , " says one skeptic . Tan disagrees . " One day we 'll be competitive with the U.S. major leagues , " he says . " This here is about Double A baseball , and soon we 'll be at Triple A. " // When and if this happens , the Taiwanese game will still seem distinct from the American game . " The Taiwanese are trying to produce their own style , " says Huff . " They do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a preamble , then future Taiwanese professional hitters will always make contact and will run well . Pitchers will hardly walk anybody and will master many different pitches , none of which will go straight . All teams will play with intelligence , and they will play together . Even Tan will tell you that although the Taiwanese will never emulate the strident ritualism of Japanese baseball , a dugout in Taipei will always feature more solidarity than one in Boston or Chicago . " Virtue never stands alone , " said Confucius . // Taiwanese baseball executives are the same men who created an industrialized " Little Dragon " from the ashes of World War II . " We must protect the game , we must keep being creative , we must improve the standard of player performance , " says Tiger general manager Chen . Already the blueprint for industrial success is being applied to baseball . Among the priorities are new ballparks and a wage scale elevated enough to lure the best players home from Japan .

The usually reliable Strong does n't have it tonight , either . At the end of the fourth , the score is 9-5 , and one inning later the Dragons ' margin is 10-6 . The Lions have 13 hits and the Dragons 11 . The game is three hours old . Manager Chu has been tolerant , but he has seen enough , and he motions for a pitching change . To start the sixth , a slender man wearing the Dragons ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He warms up with an economical motion featuring a compact leg kick . This is Huang Ping-yang  --  or , as many call him , Jin Be-ruen ( the Man with the Golden Arm ) . He is the quintessential Taiwanese athlete : a player of rare skill and a perfect gentleman . // Huang takes his warmup tosses . They include a veering sinker , a knuckleball and a nasty forkball to complement his other , more mundane tools , such as an 86-mph fastball . That 's not Sandy Koufax , but then this is n't Los Angeles , and besides , deception is Huang 's game . " He 's smart , the smartest pitcher I 've ever seen , " says Strong . Huang had gotten his seventh win of the season earlier in the week , but tonight when Strong was n't , and Chu looked down the bench , Huang said he felt capable of offering the American a little relief . // Thirty minutes later the game is over . Mixing sinkers and knuckle curves , Huang has walked none , permitted one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wraps his arm carefully . Then he goes home to drink some tea . // " Tea is training for baseball , " says Huang . " It makes me calm . When I play , there is such a large audience . Many people panic . Tea stabilizes me . The Chinese see drinking tea as a kind of self-training . " In the basement of Huang 's Taipei home , behind a bamboo curtain , is his teahouse , and it is here that he entertains friends with an ancient Chinese tea ceremony . It 's a beautifully decorated room . Rice paper lanterns and bamboo cages holding fluffy white songbirds hang from the ceiling . Poems in elegant calligraphy and depictions of mountains and lakes in black-and-white ink washes cover the walls . Elsewhere are pieces of jade , ceramic bowls and hundreds of teapots , of which Huang and his best friend , Dragon centerfielder Lin I-tseng , are avid collectors . Some of Huang 's teapots are more than 300 years old . // Huang is renowned for his skill at preparing tea . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot , no good ; if too cold , no good , " says Wu , who drinks with Huang on occasion . Huang does everything gracefully . First he pours a cup that is to be smelled and then discarded into a large bowl . The glazed clay cups are small . Huang 's tea is always good , so his guests drink many pots of the yellow-green infusion . After each pot is emptied , the sodden leaves are replaced . Once they dry , they may be used as pillow ticking . Sleeping on dried tea leaves is thought to encourage strength of mind . // Huang is talking about teamwork . " It 's a matter of tradition in our race , " he says while filling the cups that are set out before him on an exotic burnished-red-wood table . " Japanese , Koreans and Chinese pay attention to teamwork . You must know your partner , so you can always be certain what he will do next . Almost everyone on our team likes to drink tea . That 's why we win so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we communicate . " // Lin nods in agreement . He 's a bashful man , and nothing embarrasses him more than when Strong calls him " the Rickey Henderson of Taiwan . " But the fact is that at 33 , Lin is the best nonpitcher in the country  --  a graceful centerfielder , a steady hitter and a roe on the bases . Lin does n't have as many teapots as Huang , but as Huang will tell you , " Every one of Lin 's teapots is good . " // Lin is called Daw Sheoi ( the Handsome Thief ) . Last year he stole 34 bases in 85 games . " I can still run fast because I am a fighter , " he says from behind his teacup . " Everyone has his duty , and since my talent is running , I must run . " And his friend Huang ? " He 's very changeable . He knows seven pitches , so it 's hard to stay with him . " // Huang is from the bustling port city of Kaohsiung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Little League he was the only member of his team to keep playing ball . " I loved it , and my parents supported me , " he says . He attended Fu Jen University in Taipei , where he played baseball . Then , after mandatory military service , he spent two years playing in Japan . Today his parents live with him , and if they could , so would most children in the neighborhood , who flock about his gate at all hours of the day . // Confucius said that " to love unbending strength without loving learning is liable to lead to undiscipline , " but Huang is in no danger of falling prey to that . He likes to read poetry , especially the Tang Dynasty master Li Pai , and he owns a number of ink calligraphy brushes with which he copies some of his favorite verses from memory . " Everywhere I go , I visit writers and poets , " he says . " Mostly they want to talk about baseball . I ask them about calligraphy . I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preparing his body for punishment by running , lifting weights and taking massages . " My arm has been trained , " is how he explains winning 20 games the summer of 1990. // Huang is a Buddhist , but he is not immune to Chinese mysticism . " Buddhism influenced me very much , " he says . " My emotions remain placid , and that 's important for a lengthy season . That does n't mean I do n't care about winning , only that I keep it in perspective . As for pitching , I like it for two reasons . One has to do with my figure . People thought I looked like a pitcher . The second has to do with my blood type . Chinese catchers are blood type A. They must consider many situations . Pitchers are blood type O. Blood type O is most calm and patient and willing to fight . When I 'm pitching , I 'm happiest when I outsmart someone . Western pitchers throw very fast , but they are n't always controlled . We Chinese ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very controlled . " // Yes , they are . " The gentleman is easy of mind , " said Confucius .
