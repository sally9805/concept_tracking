<p> " Scandal , everybody loves it " : Seasoned newsman Bill Davis ' Albany Journal is sometimes the town 's conscience , sometimes the clothesline for its dirty laundry , hung out in tabloid-like form . <p> Albany - From the Bois du Boulogne to the Sandy Bottom section of downtown Albany , Bill Davis has navigated through life on a flight plan with the general destination of mischief . <p> Along the way , he 's been the professional prodigal son of a wealthy Atlanta family , an airman on a Black Widow bomber crew , a foreign correspondent , a failed poet , and recently , a victim of the summer 's flooding . For the past 43 years , he 's done his trouble-seeking from the same base , as the editor and publisher of the Albany Journal , a feisty , slightly schizophrenic weekly that is sometimes the conscience of the city and sometimes the clothesline for its dirty laundry . <p> At 75 , Davis still exhibits the air of an aging boulevardier and the journalistic instincts of a mako shark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and contentious life ; he 's outlived some of his best enemies and made friends with some of his favorite targets . <p> " When I came to Albany , the people in town thought I was some kind of wild man , which I was , " Davis said . " But now that I 've become more a part of the establishment , it 's not as much fun anymore . " <p> Screaming headlines <p> It 's still fun , though , to flash across the front page of the Albany Journal . Some recent stories with screaming headlines include : " MAD DAD ORDERS CASTRATION BY BUZZ-SAW OF CHILD 'S LOVER , " a mutilation story that almost had an Albany connection ; " SHERIFF , OL ' GIL , LOCKED IN BATTLE OVER NEW JAIL , " an account of a bureaucratic conflict between Dougherty County Sheriff Jamil Saba and County Commission Chairman Gil Barrett ; " 7-YEAR ITCH ; WHEN TRUST TURNS TO LUST , " an account of the deterioration of the marriage of an unidentified Albany couple ; and " BABY DOCTORS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle between neonatal specialists . <p> Inside , there are even more guilty pleasures . For the intellectually arrogant , there is a reprint of the New York Times Sunday crossword puzzle . For the shameless gossipmongers , there is " Nite Trax , " a column written under the pen name Brittany James and providing a box score on the local carousing circuit . <p> Davis makes no apologies for marbling news and commentary with sleaze . <p> " I tried national news , world news ; that did n't work . But scandal , everybody loves it , " he said . <p> Subscription of 6,000 <p> Hijacking people 's attention is a matter of survival , Davis said . With about 6,000 paying subscribers , it is a weekly battle to get more people to buy the paper . " If I ca n't shock ' em , I ca n't live , " he said . <p> When there 's a really juicy headline on the front page , more people buy the paper , he said . <p> Not everyone who buys the Journal wants that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people to tuck their copy of the Journal into some more respectable reading material , he said . <p> However , Davis strives to distinguish his paper from the supermarket tabloids , which he calls " mad dogs . " <p> Still , respectability has never been one of Bill Davis ' primary objectives in life . He left a comfortable family background to study drama . He was in New York , trying to break into radio soap operas in the early 1940s , when his draft number came up . <p> Rather than wait to be inducted , he enrolled in a flight school and later enlisted in the Army Air Corps . As a radar navigator , he flew 34 missions over Germany , mostly in a P-61 fighter-bomber . <p> She hired him , they married <p> Davis was n't ready to leave Europe after his discharge in 1946 . He went to the Army Exchange Service in Germany , where the personnel director was an attractive British woman named Pauline , who was looking for someone to be the editor of a new magazine for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . <p> The magazine lasted about a year and a half , but Davis was able to get a job as a correspondent in Vienna for the Armed Forces Network . <p> With his savings , he bought a 1946 Buick sedan , a major luxury in postwar Europe . They decided to move to Paris , where Davis traded the Buick for an apartment near the exclusive Bois du Boulogne district . <p> During their Parisian stint , Davis tried his hand at writing poetry . But he was soon back on the market for more regular employment , and he accepted a job as a civilian employee of the military government in Berlin during the Berlin blockade . <p> By the early 1950s , Davis was ready to come back to Georgia , but not to the family homestead in Atlanta . His father owned a liquor distributorship in Albany and urged him to go there . <p> Davis purchased the Albany Journal , which even then was a weak- sister weekly losing ground to the Albany Daily Herald . <p> Davis developed an immediate affection for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , warm departure from the depressed cities of Europe . <p> " There were palm trees downtown , and out at Radium Springs , the Paramount Club had wide-open gambling , roulette wheels and live Maine lobsters , " he said . " I thought , ' This is paradise . ' " <p> Throughout most of the 40 years or so that Davis has put out the Journal , he has maintained both a running feud and an ongoing friendship with James Gray , who was then the editor and publisher of the Herald and , for a time , mayor of Albany . <p> Though they warred in print , Davis said , they drank together at night . <p> Davis recalled that during those early years , his daughter Pamela , now a small-business development executive in Atlanta , was sometimes ridiculed at her school because of her father 's penchant for print attacks on the local establishment . <p> After Gray 's death in 1986 , his heirs sold the Herald to a corporation , leaving the Journal as the lone independent newspaper in town . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I became ' the editor . ' " <p> In recent years , Davis has expanded his media sphere , with a weekly news interview on a local cable system 's public access channel . He calls it " raising hell every week . " <p> Public officials express varying degrees of discomfort at finding themselves on Davis ' hot seat . <p> Albany Mayor Paul Keenan said , " Many times I find myself in disagreement with him , but more often than not , Bill Davis and his paper focus in rather accurately on our problems . " <p> Keenan said Davis is " one of the few remaining independent small- town weekly editors . He 's a very insightful and colorful columnist and a talented writer , though some people do n't appreciate some of the things he writes . " <p> Barrett said he has often found himself at odds with Davis on public issues . " I look at him sometimes like a little dog - when you pat him , he barks at you , but when you walk away , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me for so long , but still , I 'd hate to wake up tomorrow and find out that the Albany Journal is closed for business . " <p> ' Doing some good ' <p> Not even the flood of the century could shut Bill Davis down . Even though his Radium Springs home was virtually destroyed by the flood , the paper never missed a deadline . And Davis said he intends to rebuild and keep the paper going . <p> But why has this man of the world devoted so much of his life to fighting small-town battles ? <p> " I think after 45 years I 've learned a little bit about how to titillate the public fancy , " he said . <p> But there 's something more . <p> " I thought , " he added , " I was doing some good .
