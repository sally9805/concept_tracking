If you happen to be a prominent Republican these days , you have to wonder where your revolution went . The party that entered Washington in glory last year is looking anything but triumphant now . With its members divided among themselves , cranky about their presumptive presidential nominee and nervously entertaining the thought that their House majority might not survive November , Republicans are going through what even House Speaker Newt Gingrich calls a " funk . " <P> This funk starts at the top . Bob Dole 's campaign has yet to find its feet or its voice . His strategy of running for President by running the Senate has hit up against the White House 's strategy , which consists in part of letting congressional Republicans expose themselves in public while Clinton says , " Tsk , tsk . " Right now it 's working . In recent weeks the President 's lead over Dole in the polls has been growing about 2 points a week ; the gap is now 14 points . <P> Meanwhile , Republicans on Capitol Hill find themselves outflanked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So fractious and demoralized last year , the Democrats perform now like a synchronized swim team , setting the legislative agenda despite their minority status . Minimum-wage talking points are lofted among them like balloons . The budget passed last week provided billions of dollars for programs that Republicans had sworn to kill . In April , when Dole shelved the immigration bill after Democrats tried to attach riders on both the minimum wage and Social Security , he reminded the opposition sourly , " We have the majority . " He could be forgiven for seeing how that might be possible to forget . <P> What scares top Republicans is the prospect that Dole will not get their message  --  that he needs to find a compelling message fast . Fund-raising circles are still buzzing about a conference call last Tuesday between Dole and the " Team 100 " cadre of top G.O.P. fund raisers . When one asked where he stood on Ross Perot issues  --  balancing the budget , term limits , campaign-finance reform  --  Dole plunged into legislative proposals and subclauses . No good , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pained silence followed . " It was horrible , " says a participant . " Just horrible . " <P> Frustration over Dole 's inability to formulate themes has boiled over into the public . Not long after the conservative Weekly Standard predicted a Dole defeat , former Education Secretary William Bennett complained in a speech that " there 's very little enthusiasm about Bob Dole . " Conservative columnist Robert Novak accused Dole 's campaign of " disorganization , lack of discipline and failure to articulate a coherent message . " Things have got so bad that White House spokesman Mike McCurry passed up an opportunity to criticize Dole at a Friday press briefing . Said McCurry with mock concern : " All these Republicans are pounding on him . "
