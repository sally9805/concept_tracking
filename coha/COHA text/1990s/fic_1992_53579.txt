Next year , writing his personal experience essay to convince admissions at Penn he 's Ivy League material despite uneven grades , he 'll describe in amusing detail the one baseball game his father took him to , and get in on a scholarship despite his father 's explicit pessimism . And he 'll do well , though he 's not as brilliant as his father , just a pretty smart kid who 's used to working hard . But now on Rachel 's bed , unraveling a hole in the knee of her jeans while her parents yell at each other downstairs , he can not join in her raillery . " Let 's go , " he says . <p> " Wait . This is the part about who was the first unfaithful one ! " <p> " Let 's go ! " he says . He has a curfew , a job to get up for tomorrow . Then there 's the air outside the house , the smell of new grass mixing with the smell of Rachel when she lets him touch her under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's funny , really . It 's high comedy . " <p> But she does n't protest as he takes her hand and leads her down and outside . <p> Rachel is seventeen , a year older than Demian , though in the same grade . She lost a year when she went , as she says , loony , and spent several months in the bin getting her spirit broken to the point where she 'd attend school and respond , numbly , to teacher and test questions . Still , her grades are better than his . Sometimes it seems to him he ca n't stand her , half an inch taller than he is , the way when she 's not thinking about it she arcs down into herself like a long-necked bird , the way tall girls are n't supposed to . He used to love to play baseball , it was all he wanted to do  --  if not on the field then in a symbolic version with cards and dice in his room  --  and when this feeling of loathing comes over him , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be specific , standing between second and third with his knees bent , whispering in the direction of the batter  --  hit it to me , I dare you . He remembers his two best friends from then , brothers a year apart , Tom and John Frank , the clean , sharp edge of the way they bad-mouthed each other after the game . And then the queasiness comes , because something he has done with Rachel or is about to do has rendered him unfit for baseball . <p> He walks quickly now , a step ahead of her , over to the playground behind the local preschool , where they 've gone the past months to talk and kiss and perform all but the final technical act of sexual intercourse . The ground is laid in gravel through which sharp , hard weeds poke up , but the chain-link fence is low enough to climb over , the large wooden sandbox lies half in the shadow of the building , the sand is cool and dry and molds after a while to one or the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not embrace . Rachel sits down on the dark side of the sandbox . At first she seems to have disappeared . Then he sees in the dark the lesser darkness of her face , the pale stretch of her shoulders , too wide for a girl . She smells sour and sweet like strawberries . He is moved by something in Rachel , her craziness , her cynicism , facets of personality he dimly perceives he may have to own some day . He remembers a school assembly where she danced on center stage with the other dancers weaving around her , her tums and leaps bolder than theirs , more complete . " Rachel , " he says , " I really like you . " <p> She does n't respond , but the prickle of the skin of his arms tells him he has said the wrong thing . He tries again . " You 're a really good dancer . " He elaborates on the performance he saw , comparing her dancing to the way he used to feel about baseball . Still feels sometimes . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole he walks around and around . <p> " Rachel , " he says in despair , " I feel bad for you . " He does n't mention her parents . Really , he does n't want to talk about them . Their dads by some fluke knew each other in college , and Rachel 's sometimes asks him how his father 's doing , a show of interest or courtesy his father does n't return . Demian himself can barely manage to speak to her father , who makes more money than his father and calls him the Old Hippie . " Ask him about Woodstock , " Mr. Geller once said , and Demian said , " Why do n't you ask him yourself , " knowing his father had n't gone to Woodstock , as Mr. Geller also knew . Mr. Geller is soft-looking and bottom-heavy like an old pear . Demian ca n't stand Mr. Geller , has only broached the subject as a gift for Rachel . <p> She says , " They 're not my real parents . " <p> He laughs , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to divorce them , " she says . " There 's a new law , in Vermont . " <p> " In Massachusetts , I think . " <p> She shrugs , irritated with his quibble . He talks quickly to assuage her . " Then you can marry my parents . " <p> " Who wants your parents ? " <p> " What 's wrong with my parents ? " <p> " Your father has a mean streak . " <p> " No he does n't ! " <p> His eyes have adjusted to the light . He can see the parts of her face that jut out , eyebrows , cheekbones , slope of nose . She seems too sharply constructed , a witch woman , though she 's sitting cross-legged like a child , pouring handfuls of dry sand over her thighs . " He wo n't let you do stuff for no reason , " she says . " For spite . " <p> Demian knows that in similar words he has complained to her about his father , who gave him a curfew earlier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him permission to attend parties , and who was n't planning  --  he 'd warned him  --  to let him get his driver 's license till he was eighteen years old . Teenagers have glop for brains , he 'd said . Though as a teenager himself  --  his mother had told him  --  he 'd dropped out of college and done a lot of the drugs teenagers were supposed to say no to these days . Demian has n't really spoken to his father since the day he refused to sign the learner 's permit . But now Demian says , " He has his own ideas . He does what he thinks is right and not what everybody else does ! " <p> canned . " <p> He 's about to stand up , leave , maybe . But she takes his arm . " Demian , I love you . " <p> " So you can say anything you want to me ? " <p> She puts her arms around him , thrusts her tongue into his mouth . He keeps up his end of the bargain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . His fingers are wet with her . As usual he tries to pull off her shorts . As usual she pushes away from him . Once he questioned her , learned that her noncompliance had to do with something apologetic she detected in his attitude toward sex . Since then , his efforts have been mild , ritualized , She is his first real girlfriend . Fie is pleased to be kissing and touching her even at the level of intimacy she has ordained . She hurls herself at his hand , trembling . <p> He has to be home by 10:30 and it 's 11:35 by the oven clock as he tiptoes across the kitchen . Fie has never missed curfew before , but the evening is still warm on his skin , he feels invulnerable . And his father is surely asleep . <p> He takes his shoes off in the living room . His father is inactive , his mother says . The understatement of the year , Demian thinks . Tired from working in the bookstore , which does n't bring in enough for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the couch in front of the ten o'clock news , and Demian and his mother have to prod him up to bed . <p> But he 's up now , standing in his PJs at the top of the stairs . His long , thin , still young-looking face is blank ; not even his lips seem to move as he says , " You 're grounded . " His lips are pressed close together , a tuck in the long swatch of his face , but the words linger in the air well after his lanky body has vanished behind the master bedroom door . <p> In bed Demian is stiff with fury . There is no recourse ; the only question is how long . And even worse than not seeing Rachel is seeing her with the weight of his father 's edict on his shoulders , making him smaller than he is , unworthy of her . <p> Four years from now Demian will fly home from school in time to watch his father breathe in comatose sleep , then cease breathing  --  feeling nothing , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have any impact on his father . Later he 'll rage at his father for dying before he was ready for him to die , and later still he may decide that if his father was n't ideal he did the best he could . But now Demian has hopes for what he can be to his father and what his father can be to him . <p> Demian is up early , hours before he has to leave for Bi-Rite 's , rehearsing the speech he 'll give his father at the breakfast table . He has it outlined in his head like a five-paragraph essay , and now with the sun turning the sky pink , then blue , he sits at the kitchen table while his mother , who has to leave soon to teach summer school , performs five or six brisk cleaning and cooking acts . His father sips coffee . His father butters a piece of rye toast , as slowly as an old man , though his hair is still thick , his face unlined ; people sometimes think he 's Demian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bites , " I want you to reconsider . " <p> His father looks to the left , the right , all around the room . " Who 's talking ? Is somebody talking to me ? " <p> Demian 's ears feel hot . This is the first direct statement he 's made to his father in several months . " Dad , I 'm never late . I should n't be punished the first time I mess up . Give me a second chance . " <p> " Look , you . " His father 's voice is quiet , but it takes up the room . " If some dude walks into my store with a gun , and I say hey now just wait a minute , do I get a second chance ? " <p> Demian sees the illogic of his father 's argument , but his father stands up , leaning forward as if about to fall on him . " If you get sick , kiddo . If your heart hurts , air sticks in your throat , you say with your last feeble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , what did I do , could you please , please give me a second chance , what 's He going to say to you ? Tell me , Demian . " <p> Demian wants to ask his father what makes him think he 's God , but the air or something is stuck in his throat . <p> " Let 's say you get your girlfriend pregnant , Demian . Let 's say for the sake of argument you knock up your young lady . But you are n't ready to be Papa yet . You want to walk across Turkey in your stocking feet . You want to climb Mt . Tamalpais and keep on going . " <p> His father has just said more , it seems , than he has ever said to Demian before . His hands are waving , his face is white , and Demian 's mother pats his back , leads him back to the table . She gets him more coffee , hovers over him , though she 's running late , till his face warms up . He kisses her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to Demian . Demian feels sick , choking on the words he ca n't speak to his father . " Mom , " he whispers after the door is shut , " is he mean , or what " <p> " Demian , " she says , " you 've got to give him some slack . The business is n't going well . " <p> " Who cares ? " Demian 's voice rises . Every once in a while he 's allowed to sneer in front of his mother . It 's his one respite , acting like his father in front of his mother . " Mine is n't going well , either . " He watches her face , prepared to shut down at the first sign of her disapproval . <p> " Demian , " she says , " he may have to declare bankruptcy . Do n't say anything to him , please . Eat your breakfast . " <p> Her lips look blue , like the lips of little kids who have been in the water too long . Demian eats his cereal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of his father 's toast . It 's not even eight o'clock , he has plenty of time . He eats while his mother says nice things about his father . How good he is to her . How well his friends like him , even the rich , much-respected ones . Demian is aware that people listen when his father speaks . Demian would like his own friends to treat him as his father 's friends treat his father . Sometimes he quiets his voice , thins it out a little , to see if that 's the trick . <p> " He 's way too smart for what he does , " his mother is saying . " He did well in college without studying . He could remember everything he 'd ever read . He was a great talker , there was nothing he could n't have done if he 'd wanted to  --  do you know how high his IQ is ? " <p> " Higher than mine , " Demian says . <p> His mother does n't protest , just shakes her head as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit and figure things out . He was too young to have a child . " <p> " Mom , " Demian says , " he was twenty-six when I was born . He 's forty-two . " <p> " He was too young , " she says firmly , gathering up her books . " But he loves you like crazy , you ought to know that . " <p> Pedaling to work Demian thinks about his father 's IQ , how many points it might be higher than his own , and tries to see him as the Disappointed Man in his mother 's fiction . He says bankrupt under his breath , trying to diminish his father enough to forgive him . It does n't work . He tries to feel his father 's love for him , remembering a ballgame his father took him to on his tenth birthday  --  him and his best friend , John Frank , and John Frank 's father . He remembers sitting next to John in the back of their old Rabbit with his baseball glove in his lap for catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking with John 's father , John 's father laughing at his father 's jokes , though John 's father drove a Volvo and everyone called him Dr. Frank . Demian was proud of his father . It was clear even then that although his father talked less than his friend 's father , it was his father 's words that thickened in the air . His father had given him and John their own tickets to hold , and jouncing along on the back seat , they squinted at the blue and white cardboard oblongs , discussing the numbers and letters that stood for what they were about to experience . SAT AUG 1:20 PM . AISLE 518 ROW 5 SEAT 242 . GAME #52 CHICAGO CUBS VS . NEW YORK METS . ADMIT ONE SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS ON BACK NO REFUND NO EXCHANGE . There was one set of letters he could n't fathom : OBST VW . He showed the ticket to John . " Obstetrician ? " John asked . <p> " It 's a beer ad . Obst Blue Ribbon ! " <p> " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fart head . " <p> Only when they got to the park and sat down in seats behind a pillar that let him see half the field if he craned to the right , did he realize the letters stood for Obstructed View . At first he did n't mind . He 'd never been to a major-league game before . The smell of hot dogs and popcorn filled his mouth and nose , the stands were cool and dim like a naptime bedroom , the playing field bright green under the sun . He put his glove on , waiting for his father to sit down next to him , not necessarily to talk to him , since of course he had more to say to Dr. Frank , but just to be there so Demian could ask him questions or maybe just sit quietly beside him , watching him watch the game . But when Demian had finished taking in the brightness and darkness , and located his favorite Cub , Shawon Dunston , who could hurl the ball like the end of a whip , his father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you guys after the game , " he called to them , holding out a five-dollar bill . " Do n't eat too much . " Demian took the bill , folded and folded it again as his father and Dr. Frank descended the steep steps , vanishing toward seats Demian knew had an unencumbered view of the field . Still , he was n't sure what to make of the turnaround . It was n't exactly what he 'd pictured when he 'd asked on his tenth , his double-digit birthday , not for something to ride or look at or hold in his hand , but for an event to experience with his father . The man who took his father 's seat told him stories about the ballplayers ' personal lives . It was lots of fun sitting with John , leaning hard one way around the pillar to watch the ball come off the bat , then the other way to see where the ball ended up . Shawon Dunston threw the ball into the dugout , and the Cubs still won . But although he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balls went to seats below them in the sun . And although he and John kept good track of the game , marking the P.O. 's , F.O. 's , K 's , H 's on their scorecards with their short yellow ballpark pencils , some of the balls fell where neither of them could see . The man in his father 's seat said Shawon Dunston would never learn to take a walk because he was mentally retarded . When Demian 's father returned for them after the game , the skin of his arms looked dark gold in the sun , and it was clear to Demian that the game he 'd seen was not as good a game . <p> Demian leans back in his chair at the Geller breakfast table , puts his feet on a second chair , takes the cup of coffee Rachel has poured him . He 's never had coffee before , and he gulps it like milk , bums his throat , swallows his grimace . Rachel does n't ask him why he is n't at Bi-Rite 's this morning . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's barefoot , in a long , wrinkled shirt she must have slept in . He imagines what 's under the shirt ; his face bums . Her brown hair looks white blond on the side where the sun hits . <p> She runs into the kitchen , returns with a plate of kiwi and nectarines , and two dark blue cloth napkins . But on the gray tile of the kitchen floor she has left patches of red . She is limping . He watches , frozen , as blood wells out of her foot . She sits down , crosses her leg over her knee , eats a nectarine , while her blood drip-drips onto the gray tile . He thinks , Why does n't she wipe it up ? Should he wipe it up ? Someone should wipe it up . It gives him the creeps , these bright red splashes , but the cloth napkin she presents him seems too fine for this use . He 's looking around for paper when she throws a piece of broken china onto the table in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It 's the source of her injury , picked up from the kitchen floor  --  a white shard , triangular in shape , a thin gold line around the part that had been rim . The broken edge is red . " Carnage , " she says , accenting and softening the last syllable like a French word . This morning her father had relieved some of his anger by throwing a cup at the refrigerator . Her mother relieved hers by refusing to sweep . " They need to see this , " she says , placing the broken piece of china on the blue cloth napkin in the middle of the breakfast table . She seems thrilled almost , as if the bloody shard is the final piece of the puzzle of her life . She arranges a kiwi on the napkin , a bud vase alongside . " It 's our new centerpiece ! A still life ! What 'll we call it , Terror at Teatime ? " She speaks with a British accent , biting off her words with her teeth . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " <p> He starts laughing . " That 's terrific . It 's really funny . " He laughs more , in loud bursts . He has never laughed like this before . He tells her the story of the one baseball game his father took him to , exaggerating his hopes so that their obstruction by the pillar seems purely comic . She takes his hand , squeezing hard , and he elaborates , this time stressing his naive reverence for his father , his father 's indifference . What had his father called out , descending the stairs ? Demian does n't remember now , makes it up : " Try and have fun , kiddo ! .... We 'll be thinking of you , suckers ! .... Look , you  --  you 're lucky you were n't offed in utero ! " It does n't sound like his father but makes him laugh hysterically . <p> She starts laughing , too . " He slapped me this morning . I told him what I thought of people who ca n't control themselves , and he held me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She grabs a hunk of her hair , yanks her head to one side , giggles . " He said , ' I 'll show you how I control myself . ' " <p> He smooths her hair where she yanked . He has begun shaking a little , though he does n't feel sad or scared . " Sometimes in the room with him I feel like I do n't exist . I do n't have a body . I do n't know how to talk , even . " He 's shaking harder , down to the soles of his feet . He has never spoken like this . " He 'd slap me , too , if he thought I was important enough . The truth is , I bore him . Poor Dad , bored by his son . " He replays what he said , awed by what seems to be the utter truth of it . It seems reckless and marvelous saying these things about his father . He 's an explorer , charting ground never before seen by mortal eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow it would n't make the least difference in my life . It might improve things . " <p> Later , with his father 's blood leaking into his brain , he 'll remember what he said , and even though over the years his father had grown no more interested in him , he 'll think for a moment of all the things his father wanted to do that he could n't do , could n't ever do now , and he 'll sit down in a chair by the bed , for a moment unable to breathe . <p> But now he 's on his knees before Rachel 's chair . She puts her arms around his shoulders , presses her face to the top of his head . He hears her heart beating through her T-shirt . His teeth are chattering , and to stop them he starts kissing her through her shirt  --  her shoulder , the two round little bones at the top of her chest , the long swell of breast . In the past he has treated this part of her body reverently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wetting the cloth of her shirt till it feels to his lips like rough , wet skin . He has stopped trembling . " I hate him , " he murmurs , almost lovingly . <p> " Has he ever knocked your mother down ? Called her a slut ? Said he could smell it on her ? I 'm in the same room , here at this very table eating my cantaloupe . " <p> He ca n't tell if she likes what his mouth is doing , but she has made no objection . He raises her shirt , observes her body in the daylight ; thinks , There is so much of her . He says , " He made me sit behind a pole . He traded in his ticket and sat with a buddy . The only baseball game he ever took me to . " <p> It does n't sound quite awful enough . He looks at her for confirmation , but she seems not to have heard him . " Has he ever come home drunk and gotten in bed with you ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And when you bit his hand he told lies to your mother ? Who still thinks you 're a slut though she does n't say so ? " <p> " Is that true , Rachel ? " <p> She shakes her head no . " Another example of my sick imagination . " <p> Her voice is light but he ca n't shake off the terrible picture . " If it were true I 'd kill him . " <p> " Me , too . " <p> Her last comment comes without inflection . He tries to read her face , but it does n't help . He hugs her hard . She returns it with a slight time lag , mechanically stroking the back of his head . She seems uncharacteristically passive . He feels sure that if he were to take off his pants , she 'd sigh once , then let him have her . The thought terrifies him . " Rachel , where are you ? " <p> She looks at him , smiling with the corners of her mouth only . He wants to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , whose manager is a friend of his dad 's and might not question the excuse he 'll make up on the way . But Rachel is sitting so still in her chair , she seems to take up no space . He imagines that if he left her , he 'd never find her again . When he called , her mother would say , Shed traveling in Europe . Her mother would say , There 's no one here by that name . <p> " Rachel , " he whispers . He touches her face , the curve of her arm , side of her knee , arch of her wounded foot , softly so as not to miss her faintest whispered response . Her foot feels cold , and he warms it between his hand and his face . Then he puts his lips to the injured spot , cleaning off the dried blood with his tongue , smoothing down the flap of torn skin . <p> <p> By Sharon Solwitz <p> Sharon Solwitz has twice been the recipient of the Nelson Algren Award .
