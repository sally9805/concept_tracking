Reviving Ophelia is my attempt to understand my experiences in therapy with adolescent girls . Many girls come into therapy with serious , even life-threatening problems , such as anorexia or the desire to physically hurt or kill themselves . Others have problems less dangerous but still more puzzling , such as school refusal , underachievement , moodiness , or constant discord with their parents . Many are victims of sexual violence . // As I talked to these girls , I became aware of how little I really understood the world of adolescent girls today . It did n't work to use my own adolescent experience from the early 1960s to make generalizations . Girls were living in a whole new world .... // Even in our small city with its mostly middle-class population , girls often experienced trauma . How could we help girls heal from that trauma ? And what could we do to prevent it ? // This last year I have struggled to make sense of this . Why are girls having more trouble now than my friends and I had when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet for the most part we were n't suicidal and we did n't develop eating disorders , cut ourselves , or run away from home .... // But girls today are much more oppressed . They are coming of age in a more dangerous , sexualized , and media-saturated culture . They face incredible pressures to be beautiful and sophisticated , which in junior high means using chemicals and being sexual . As they navigate a more dangerous world , girls are less protected . // As I looked at the culture that girls enter as they come of age , I was struck by what a girl-poisoning culture it was . The more I looked around , the more I listened to today 's music , watched television and movies and looked at sexist advertising , the more convinced I became that we are on the wrong path with our daughters . America today limits girls ' development , truncates their wholeness , and leaves many of them traumatized .... // What can we do to help them ? We can strengthen girls so that they will be ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can support and guide them . But most important , we can change our culture . We can work together to build a culture that is less complicated and more nurturing , less violent and sexualized and more growth-producing . Our daughters deserve a society in which all their gifts can be developed and appreciated . I hope this book fosters a debate on how we can build that society for them . //
