I WAS WALKING THROUGH the lobby toward the gambling tables and I noticed that some of the letters had fallen off the sign near the registration desk . BALLY 'S RENO WELCOME EROS ACE SCIENCE INSTITUTE OF AMERICA <p> Eros Aces . Not bad . It could have been the name of a sleazy lounge band at one of the brothels on the edge of town . Reno is a cross between Disneyland and Gomorrah  --  a living shrine to every obsessive-compulsive character disorder known to Homo americanus . A few of us had been pushing to get the conference site changed  --  New Orleans maybe , even Houston  --  but money had changed hands in some smoky board room somewhere , and we were hooked into " The Biggest Little City in the World " for another two years . It was n't all bad . I liked hanging around late at night in the card room near the main entrance . One to three poker , pretty relaxed , and it was a perfect vantage point for watching the nation 's top aerospace executives filter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones who had been out to the Mustang Ranch . They scuttled across the lobby like great , blue-suited crabs , heads down , hands stiffly at their sides , projecting a studied air of intense concentration , like they were preparing for that big presentation tomorrow . What they were really thinking was probably more like , How am I going to act normal with June , Wally , and the Beaver when I get back to Mayfield ? <p> I sat down at one of the five-dollar blackjack tables , gave the dealer a fifty-dollar bill , and she gave me ten red chips . There were two other men at the table , both from the conference . They were still wearing their name tags , clipped to the lapels of identical charcoal-gray suits . General Dynamics . I almost laughed out loud . Back at Berkeley , whenever they did a recruiting pitch on campus , we 'd make up hundreds of posters and plaster them all over the place . It was a picture of a mushroom cloud . Above the picture - GENERAL DEMONICS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OUT OF IT ? There was always some angry looking suit with an ice scraper stalking from one poster to the next , ripping down what he could . We 'd follow about fifty feet behind him , putting up new ones . <p> I put a chip in the circle inscribed on the felt in front of me and the dealer dealt out two cards to each of us . I looked at my hand . An ace and a ten . Blackjack . I flipped my cards over and the dealer gave me a red chip , two silvers , and a fifty-cent piece . <p> " That was my blackjack ! " the suit next to me said . <p> " You an engineer ? " I asked . <p> " Yeah , how did you know ? " <p> " Well , you 're no physicist . " <p> He looked confused , opened his mouth , then shook his head and looked own at his hand . Fifteen . The dealer was showing a king . <p> " You got ta hit that , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> He hit , busted , his friend hit , busted , and the dealer flipped a seven . They both glared at me . I smiled and shrugged my shoulders . It went on like that for a while ; me , winning slightly more often than not , the two of them getting completely hosed almost every time . After a few more hands , they gathered up their remaining chips and stalked off <p> " You from around here ? " the dealer asked me . There was a black plastic badge clipped to her white shirt that said she was Darlene from Barstow . Something about the way she carried herself told me that it had been a long time since Barstow , and that she had been around the block once or twice since then . <p> " No , Santa Fe . I 'm here for the conference . " <p> She raised her eyebrows . " You seem sorta different . " <p> " Thanks , " I said . " I guess . " <p> She dealt me another blackjack and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a hand on my shoulder and turned around . Dave Lerner . It took me a second to recognize him in the uniform  --  neat haircut , Italian wool pinstripe . I stood up and we embraced . I had n't seen him since grad school . Last I heard he was at Hughes Aircraft . I fingered the lapel of his suit . <p> " Jesus , you too ? " I asked . <p> " Yeah , well , I 'm glad to see you 're still flying the flag of the People 's Republic of Berkeley , " he said , taking in the rumpled corduroy jacket , the beard , the earring . <p> " How are things at Huge Aircrash ? " <p> " Not too bad . They made me a group leader about six months ago , so there 's a lot of management ratshit and not enough technical work , but that 's about par for the course . " <p> " Sandy still at Caltech ? " <p> " Oh year . Tenure track  --  it 's like feeding time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together about once a week . I think she wears her hair differently now , but I 'm not sure . " <p> I laughed . " I was going to ask how 's married life , but I guess I know . " <p> " We 're doing pretty well , actually . Bought a house . " <p> " Wow . You guys go down to Orchard Supply on Saturdays and look at lawnmowers ? You got ta get a Toro . . . " <p> " No , we ripped out the lawn and put in a rock garden . Nice smooth stones , little bonsai trees . The neighbors freaked . They actually had a block meeting  --  we 're getting the silent treatment right now . It 's pretty funny . " <p> I laughed again , remembering the apartment he had in grad school . Two basement rooms in the shadow of a larger building , so there was never any sun . It was on Telegraph , right next door to a martial arts school . All day long you heard the screams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're at Los Alamos , right ? " he asked . " I remember you had a few offers . . . . " <p> " Yeah , an applied math group . Algorithm development for Navier-Stokes equations . Projection methods with some new wrinkles . We do special , um  --  stuff  --  for the nonlinear advective terms . " <p> " Stuff ? " <p> " Stuff . It 's a technical term . Unbelievable resolution . We 're just starting to get some recognition out in the community , but that 's kind of a mixed thing . Remember Olaf ? " <p> He laughed . " Who ever forgets Olaf ? I have n't seen him since that asymptotics seminar . How 's he doing ? " <p> " I think he was about to get arrested for impersonating a scientist , so they made him a bureaucrat . N.D.A. " <p> " N.D.A ? " <p> " Nuclear Deterrence Agency . He saw a simulation I did of convection cells in storm clouds and got a tent in his pants you would n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireball rise , dust entertainment , that sort of thing . " <p> " Jesus , that 's some scary shit . " <p> " Yeah , those loopy motherfuckers still think the Cold War 's going on . I asked him if he wanted me to name the density array for the dust component Moscow or Kiev . ' Those are integer declarations , ' he says . What an asshole . " " You gambling ? " Darlene asked . <p> I nodded and she dealt out the cards . I got a seven and a four  --  a double down hand . Darlene was showing a six . I flipped my cards , added three chips to the three already up , and she gave me another card , tucking it face-down under the pile of chips . I peeked under the edge  --  a seven . Still alive . Darlene flipped a jack , and dealt a four from the top of the deck . Twenty . She swept up my cards and chips in a single fluid motion , making a clucking sound with her tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You gon na do the calculations ? " I shook my head . <p> " I do n't know . He wants to give us a couple hundred K. We need the scratch to keep the other programs alive , but I do n't like dealing with those people . I do n't know . " <p> " Funding 's pretty tight right now . " <p> " Yeah , the big peace scare . It 's like you picked up an ant farm , shook it up , and put it back down again . Everybody 's wondering what 's going to get cut out from under them next . The level of cynicism is pretty high . " <p> Darlene dealt me a jack and a ten . I showed it to Dave and elbowed him in the ribs . She dealt herself a king and flipped her hole card . Ace . " God damn it , " I said . Darlene shook her head , smiling . <p> " You 're not very good at this , " Dave said . <p> " I was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You were talking about a level of cynicism , " he said , smiling . <p> " Yeah , " I said . " It 's especially funky in Comp Physics . We sort of do a dual function . One is leading edge research , blue sky stuff , that 's my group . The other is , um  --  service  --  to the other divisions . If you 'll pardon the expression . " <p> " Maintaining bomb codes . " <p> " Very astute . So things could go one of two ways in the next few years . Get some people with vision and courage , aggressively pursue outside funding and start to shift the primary focus of the labs away from the military-industrial circle jerk . . . " <p> " . . . or you can bend over and hand the bomb geeks a jar of Vaseline . " <p> " Exactly . " <p> A couple of other players sat down . Darlene made change and started shuffling up a new deck . <p> " You talking or gambling ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was smiling her tone not unfriendly . <p> " Talking I guess . " I gathered up my chips . " Take it easy , Darlene . " <p> " C'm on , deal already , " one of the players said . " You 're gon na wear off the numbers . " The smile disappeared and she went back to work . <p> " You still play golf ? " Dave asked me . <p> " Jesus , not for a long time . Why ? " <p> " You 're not gon na believe this . Follow me . " <p> We made our way through the maze of slot machines and gambling tables . There was an atmosphere of barely controlled pandemonium in the place  --  flashing lights , ringing bells , a constant murmur of voices , shouts raised in victory and disappointment . At the far end of the casino stood a hologram of Barry Manilow , fifteen feet high , grinning like a fool . There was probably enough collagen in his face to smooth out the Himalayas . Marquee-style wraparound lettering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halo , announcing show times . " Persistent vegetative state , " I muttered . <p> " Huh ? " <p> " It 's a medical term . . . " I said . " Never mind . " <p> He shrugged his shoulders . " You see any good talks yet. ? " he asked . <p> " Not really , " I said . " The abstracts are supposed to be refereed but that 's kind of a joke . This is really a schmoozing conference for me anyway , see who 's doing what , find out where the bodies are buried . Besides , it really cuts into the gambling . " <p> Just ahead , a fat woman in a purple wig and a shapeless green polyester shift began screaming . A river of plastic Nixon dollars poured from the snout of the slot machine in front of her and she jammed a cardboard bucket underneath it to catch the flow . <p> " You 're giving one tomorrow , are n't you ? " Dave asked , raising his voice above the din . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Yeah , but I ca n't go to it , " I shouted back . <p> " What ? " Dave asked . <p> I shook my head . " It 's in a classified session and my clearance has n't come through yet . " <p> He chuckled . " I 'll let you know how it tums out , " he said . <p> " I appreciate that . " <p> I turned to look at the woman as we walked past . The flow of dollars had stopped . She leaned against the machine , panting , her arms wrapped around its black , shiny sides . Twin patches of red stood out on her cheeks . I looked at her eyes and I had to look away . <p> We took an escalator downstairs , walked past a bowling alley and an arcade of cheesy little boutiques , rounded a comer , and there it was . BALLY 'S RENO VIRTUAL GOLF , the sign read . <p> " You got ta be kidding , " I said . <p> " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday . " <p> We went inside . There were about ten wide booths , equally spaced around the perimeter of the room . The far end of each booth consisted of a screen , onto which was projected from the rear a. picture of a lush , green fairway . Half of the booths were occupied and most of the people were dressed for golf  --  baggy purple , blue , or salmon trousers , polyester knit shirts . They wore large , bulky helmets that covered their heads entirely . Wires trailed from the helmets to a console on the wall of the booth . They stood on raggy patches of Astroturf , slamming golf balls into the screens . I walked over and stood behind one of the booths . The guy was just teeing off . He assumed the position , shifted his weight , wiggled his hips once , and swung . He connected nicely ; the ball hit the canvas with a solid slap and fell to the floor . He just stood there . I could see the movement of his headgear tracing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomped his foot . " Shit ! " he said , his voice muffled by the helmet . <p> " There 's something vaguely autoerotic about this , " I said to Dave . <p> " Whatever you say , Dan . You wan na try it ? " <p> " Sure . . . " <p> We walked over to the " Pro Shop , " a counter manned by a pimply-faced adolescent in a " Bally 's Reno Virtual Golf " sweatshirt . There were more shirts on the wall behind him , in a sort of semaphore-sign display , and an assortment of gold clubs , woods and irons arranged in overlapping fans . <p> " Set us up , " I said . <p> " Okay , you want Spyglass Hill , Pebble Beach , or Cypress Creek ? " <p> I looked at Dave and shrugged . <p> " I do n't know , " I said . " Pebble Beach , I guess . " <p> " Good choice , " the kid said . " That 's our best course . " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't smiling . He gave us a set of dubs , a bucket of balls , and led us to an empty booth . He made an elaborate show of logging in to the console . <p> " You ever do this before ? " he asked . <p> " I played Spyglass Hill yesterday , " Dave said . <p> " Okay , so you know what to do . Good luck . " <p> " Wait a minute , " I said . " This is all simulation , right ? " <p> The kid nodded , looking at me suspiciously . <p> " Then what 's with the balls and clubs ? Why bother ? " <p> The kid took a deep breath and closed his eyes . <p> " The  --  uh  --  kinesthetic experience is enhanced by the  --  uh  --  " <p> It was a stock answer and the kid clearly had n't learned his lines . Imagine President Quayle lecturing on quantum field theory . I patted him on the shoulder . " Never mind , " I said . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He placed the helmet on Dave 's head and flicked a couple of toggle switches on its side . Then he did me . I closed my eyes as he lowered the helmet over my head . <p> I opened my eyes and I was  --  there . The illusion was perfect . The emerald green of the fairway was so bright it seemed to fluoresce in the midday sun . A few lazy clouds drifted across a sky of brilliant blue . Off to the right , the fairway was bounded by a sheer drop to the ocean . A seagull skimmed above the surf and I could hear its sharp , distant call . I looked over at Dave . He was wearing baggy orange trousers and a lime-green polo shirt . His eyes were shaded by a blue visor the size of a Frisbee . <p> " Nice outfit , " I said . <p> " You should take a look at yourself , " he said . I looked down . Plaid knickers . Argyle socks . Black and white wingtips . Christ on rollerskates . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ocean to the right of the fairway and dense woods all along the left . Dave went first . He made it look easy . With a graceful , unhurried swing he sent the simulacmm golf ball sailing into the clear blue . A display flashed in the lower right comer of my field of vision . Two-sixty out and ten to the left of center . Not bad . <p> I had n't even thought about golf for over five years , but my body seemed to remember . I walked up to the tee and took my stance . I took a deep breath and closed my eyes for a minute , trying to concentrate and relax at the same time . I opened them in time to see a large seagull swoop down and pick the golf ball off the tee in its curved , yellow beak . It headed straight as an arrow down the middle of the fairway and dropped the ball about two hundred fifty yards out . <p> Dave looked at me with a disgusted expression on his face . " Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Jesus , did I do that ? " I asked . " Sorry . " <p> " This system is very literal-minded , " he said . " If you do n't concentrate , it translates small , involuntary movements of the muscles in your face and neck into visual imagery . " He frowned . " They 're doing research on just how all that connects with your unconscious . I 'm skeptical about that , but it can be pretty trippy sometimes . Anyway , I 'll let you have this one . Call it a mulligan . " He snapped his fingers and we were out in the middle of the fairway next to our tee shots . " You 're away , " he said . <p> " Wow , " I said , looking around . " Beats walking . " <p> We were about a hundred and fifty yards out from the green . I selected a six iron , walked up to the ball , exhaled , wiggled my hips and let fly . The heel of the club caught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods . The readout displayed 110 YARDS 60 LEFT  --  IN THE ROUGH . The last phrase flashed on and off at about two beats per second . <p> " Fuck me , " I said . " Fuck my dog . " <p> Dave looked over at me like he wanted to say something . <p> I sighed . " I know , I know . Keep my head down . Left arm straight . " <p> He shook his head . " I do n't know , " he said . " I just never would 've thought you 'd wind up at a shop like Los Alamos . " <p> I paused for a minute , mentally shifting gears . I had a sharp sense of dislocation , like I had suddenly lost all points of reference . Was this conversation real ? Where was I ? I looked around at the bright green fairway , felt the breeze from the ocean raffle my hair , smelled the salt tang it brought . <p> What the hell , I thought . " I know what you mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do mainstream science at the national labs can be pretty weird . It 's not clear if we serve as a moderating influence to balance the weapons programs , or if we just legitimize that stuff by setting a good P.R . example . " I shook my head . " There 's an interesting sociology between the two factions , though . We think the weapons people are a moral scum and not particularly bright and they think we 're dilettantes and parasites . " <p> " You 're probably both right , " he said , smiling . <p> " Thanks a lot , " I said . " We 've got a good group , though , and we 're doing some of the sexiest stuff that 's being done in computational physics anywhere . I do n't know if the work would exist without the infrastructure of the labs , and the work 's just too important . It goes way beyond what piss-ant little bean counters like Olaf have in mind . " <p> A cloud passed in front of the sun and I shivered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep at night , " he said . <p> " Yeah , that 's it . You try to call things case by case and keep good boundaries . Hughes gets a lot of military contracts . What do you do ? " <p> " Well , my situation is kind of like yours . My group does spacecraft design , thermal analysis . Recon satellites mostly , so the applications cut both ways . " <p> " Malignant and benign . " <p> " Yeah . So what do you do ? I do n't know . . . you do the right thing . " <p> As we were talking he had been sizing up his shot . He pulled back the club and swung . There was the whoosh of displaced air , the soft click of compression and release as the club met the ball and followed through . <p> " You 're pretty good at this . " <p> " Yeah , well . . . " <p> " Hey , how did you do that before  --  " <p> " You mean this ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're away , " he said . My ball lay on a soft carpet of pine needles . The sun made a stippled pattern of gold and shadow through the trees . <p> " Jesus Christ , I 'm in Sherwood Forest . Where 's the green ? " <p> " Just off to the right there through the trees . See the flag ? " <p> I could just make out a tiny flash of red where he was pointing . <p> " I 'm gon na have to chip out onto the fairway . . . " <p> " No , just blast right through . The simulation 's pretty stupid about trees . You'll.be fine . " <p> I approached the ball , breathed in slowly , then out , pulled the club back and swung , remembering to keep my head down and follow through . I missed it completely . <p> " Nice practice swing , " Dave said . <p> " Thanks a lot , shithead . Shut up and let me concentrate . " <p> " It 's a Zen kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> WHEN I GOT back to my room , there was a message on the videophone . Short , not particularly sweet . " Dan , Olaf . Call me . " There was no visual . <p> That was pretty much his style . He was a strange one , all right . Second-generation Soviet emigre . Not a great physicist , but he had the political acumen of a barracuda and he rose quickly in the ranks of the D.O.D. techno-sleazeball food chain . He was always into something murky , the kind of guy you figured must have racked up a lot of Frequent Flyer miles on Southern Air Transport during the eighties . It was rumored that he once gave an AK-47 to a colleague as a wedding present . <p> I knew what he wanted . He still had a hard-on for my codes and lots more taxpayer dollars than he knew what to do with . And he loved explosions . Particularly thermonuclear explosions . Since he could n't make them for real anymore , not even underground since the Comprehensive Test Ban went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I did n't want to deal with him just then . I patched my palmtop to the vidphone , got a pipe open to the Cube at Los Alamos , and tried to get some work done . I was studying the eigenvalue spectrum of the Taylor-Goldstein equation , trying to develop a new methodology for examining the stability of a particular class of fluid flows . An eigenvalue is a number that tells you something about how a system responds when you disturb its equilibrium . The discretized Taylor-Goldstein system yields hundreds of them , only one of which corresponded to the situation of interest . <p> Eigenvalue spectrum . Taylor-Goldstein equation . I said the words aloud , feeling their shape and weight on my tongue . It felt important to contextualize them somehow , to give them meaning and substance apart from abstract self-consistency . It is a political act , the naming of a thing . <p> The work went poorly ; I was just skating on the surface of the mathematics , blind to the wholeness of it . I kept making stupid mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run time as mysterious error messages . After two hours I decided to bag it , logged off , and went to bed . <p> I woke up early the next morning and went down to the breakfast buffet . The casino was still open , of course , but it was nearly empty , and without the white-noise background sound of human voices and the random Brownian-like movement of bodies crowded around the gambling tables , the glitz seemed hollow and frayed around the edges . As I walked past the blackjack tables I noticed that there were worn spots in the carpet , and the ad-holos had a high-frequency flicker that hurt my eyes . <p> I entered the buffet room and loaded up my plate with fruit , avoiding the steam table trays of pressed soybacon and stacks of leathery flapjacks . I found a table off in the corner of the room . I did n't want to talk to anybody . The previous day 's conversation with Dave was playing itself over in my head , and the call from Olaf was sitting on my consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet time to let it all percolate . So I sat there , sipping weak coffee and nibbling on pieces of melon , watching the room fill up as the conference attendees drifted down from their rooms . I saw a few people I knew , but just nodded , and nobody came to join me . <p> If I was expecting some sort of revelation , I was disappointed . I could n't concentrate on anything for very long . My mind drifted to the talk I was supposed to give later that day , skittered over to a new card-counting strategy I had simulated on my palmtop but had n't tried yet in the casino . Before I knew it was time to hit the sessions . The first one I planned to attend was called " Physics of High-Temperature Hydrodynamics . " <p> When I got to the auditorium the session was just starting . There was a man standing at the podium in front of the room . He looked vaguely familiar , and I realized I had seen him on television on several occasions -a famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat less public career as one of the country 's leading designers of advanced thermonuclear devices . He was a few years older than I and seemed to have a relaxed , accessible air about him . I could imagine him working in his garage , playing with his children , taking long , quiet walks with his wife . He went through some preliminaries and began the lecture . <p> " Let 's start with a model problem . We have a block of aluminum , room temperature , and we suddenly raise its energy to two kilovolts by some nearby . . . um . . . event . " <p> There was a chorus of laughter from the audience . I did a quick mental calculation and realized that this corresponded to temperatures one might find in the interior of the sun . <p> " So what happens ? First of all , before we go any farther , let me just say , particularly for those of you without security clearances , that this in no way corresponds to any specific . . . um . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So what happens ? " <p> There was another chorus of laughter , and people began calling out answers . <p> " It explodes ! " <p> " It melts ! " <p> " No , it vaporizes ! " <p> " It gets gobbled up by rarefaction waves ! " <p> The speaker was delighted . <p> " Who said that ? Good . Excellent . It gets eaten away from all sides by rarefaction waves . " <p> He paused for a moment and looked around the auditorium . <p> " This is a beautiful problem , " he said . " A beautiful problem . And what makes it beautiful is this . It has . . . " <p> He paused again . The room was quiet . <p> " . . . an exact solution . " <p> My head was spinning . Suddenly , the air in the room felt too thick to breathe . I got up , knocking over the chair in front of me . The speaker paused and looked at me , his face expressionless . I could see heads in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the aisle and walked quickly out of the room . About thirty seconds passed before I realized that I had been holding my breath . I stopped and leaned against a post , inhaled deeply , exhaled . I felt numb and shaken , and in some way I did n't quite understand yet , deeply ashamed . In front of me , next to the roulette table , a holo-loop of a busty blonde woman in a see-through cocktail dress smiled and held out her hand in a beckoning gesture . It was a short loop , only about three seconds , and the mechanical repetition of the movement seemed jerky and grotesque . I noticed one of the pit bosses giving me the hairy eyeball and I began to walk . <p> I 'd like to say I hit some kind of moral high ground then and there , that I made a Commitment to Truth and World Peace , but it was n't like that at all . I just walked . After a while I found myself in front of BALLY 'S RENO VIRTUAL GOLF . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the idea of being out in the sun and resting my eyes on the spartan beauty of the California coast was very appealing . The same kid was sitting behind the counter and I nodded to him . He did n't bother with the rap this time , but led me to an empty booth and set me up . I closed my eyes , put the helmet on my head , and flicked the toggle switch . <p> It was the same place all right  --  I recognized the curving slope of the fairway and the steep dropoff to the ocean . But it was dark this time , a twilight so thick and purple it appeared almost luminous . Fat , greasy drops of black rain fell from a low , menacing overcast , and there was a sullen , red glow flickering on the bottom of the clouds off to the north . The cold wind ripping in off the ocean brought with it not only the smell of salt but something else , a sickly sweet miasma that made my gullet clench . Death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , but I knew that it was true . <p> There was a squawk overhead and a flapping sound , and a large seagull landed heavily at my feet . The feathers on one side of its body were singed and blackened , and there were open sores showing through . Its eye on the burned side was an oozing wrinkle of raw flesh . It lay there in the wet grass , twitching feebly and flapping its wings . <p> I have to get out of here , I thought . I reached up to the side of my head and found the toggle switch , felt that peculiar sense of dislocation , like I was straddling a fence between two worlds . I pulled the switch . The rain-veiled twilight coast collapsed to a thin wavering line that curved around my entire field of vision and disappeared . The roar of wind and ocean faded to a hollow , velvet absence of sound . I pulled the helmet off and staggered up to the counter . The kid said something but it did n't register . I handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The next thing I knew I was in my room , sitting at my desk . I still have no memory of how I got there . My heart was pounding in my chest . I felt like I had been running all morning . It was time to stop . My hand hovered over the vidphone keypad , and the flat gray screen seemed to suck all the light from the room into itself . Almost of their own volition , my fingers punched out the code . In a few seconds , Olaf 's face appeared on the screen . He smiled when he saw me , and in that instant I could see with incandescent clarity , held within the lines of his craggy , Slavic face , the soft , vulnerable features of a child . There was a sudden tightness in my mouth and throat , and for a moment , I could not speak . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> <p> By Daniel Marcus <p> Daniel Marcus is a graduate of Clarion West 1992 ( which he attended with Mark Bourne ) .
