Section : U.S. News <p> Dateline : Saudi Arabia <p> A series of diplomatic maneuvers send peace hopes rising , but defeating Hussein 's aggression will take more patience , resolve and cooperation <p> President Bush 's vow never to negotiate with Saddam Hussein is going the way of his " no new taxes " pledge . Although Bush denies it , bargaining to end the Persian Gulf crisis has begun , and the President already has made a major conciliatory gesture : Assuring Hussein that if he complies with the United Nations demand to withdraw from Kuwait , America will not attack him . When Hussein responded last week by saying he would free all his hostages in Iraq and Kuwait , the bargaining moved to center stage . Claims one White House official : " He 's already started the end game . ' <p> Hussein , however , could be trying to delay the game , not end it , hoping that time will erode the coalition against him and that a series of peace gestures will turn American opinion sharply against military action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose between a tainted victory - for example , a partial Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait endorsed by the Arab League - and sending American soldiers into a war the public does not support . Bush insists he will accept no " murky ending , " but negotiations usually succeed by allowing both sides to claim victory . <p> An accident or miscalculation could still spark a conflagration , and if the recent diplomatic minuet makes either leader think he has the other on the run , the pendulum could swing back to war as fast as it swung toward peace . <p> Moreover , as popular as it would be politically , a negotiated settlement would not eliminate the dangers Hussein and his arsenal pose . Indeed , a solution leaving Hussein and his military intact could increase his stature in the Arab world , worsen the strained relationship between the U.S. and Israel ( see story , page 48 ) , further damage America 's reputation in the Mideast and make defeating Iraq later more costly . " It 's important that this adventure be seen as ending in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staffer Peter Rodman , now teaching at Johns Hopkins University . " He ca n't be seen as a hero . " <p> Hussein has proved that he can not be trusted , and containing him without war would require maintaining the arms embargo against Iraq , keeping new nuclear and chemical-weapons technology out of his hands and installing a multinational peacekeeping force in the Gulf . Still , for the first time since Hussein invaded Kuwait on August 2 , an alternative to war or appeasement is taking shape . There is a growing consensus among analysts and policymakers that , depending on how Bush and Hussein play it , a two-act deal could emerge . Act I would include : <p> Release of hostages . All of Hussein 's " guests " would be allowed to go home . When they are all free , the U.S. will pull out of its besieged embassy in Kuwait . <p> Iraqi withdrawal . Hussein would comply with the U.N . resolution and pull back from all of Kuwait . <p> Kuwaiti sovereignty . Kuwait 's al-Sabah family would be restored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After the first act , the administration and its allies could declare victory , claiming Hussein got no rewards for his aggression . Those would appear in the second act , which might begin after a short intermission and which the U.S. could deny was related to the Iraqi retreat : <p> Talks with Kuwait . Iraq and Kuwait would open negotiations on Hussein 's original grievances : Iraq 's share of production from an oil field spanning both countries and guaranteed access to the Gulf through two uninhabited islands . The Iraqi leader also seeks assurances that Kuwait will help keep oil prices high . " If Iraq gets these areas as a result of talks with Kuwait , that 's a far different thing than surrendering under duress , ' insists a senior administration aide . <p> Mideast peace conference . The U.N . would convene a conference on Mideast security , including the Palestinian question , which Hussein has tried vainly since mid-August to link to the Gulf crisis . <p> Bush insists that when Hussein said he would release his hostages , he proved that America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reverse may be equally true : Bush 's inability to generate public support for his brinkmanship has made negotiations more attractive . <p> Changing tactics . The original Bush policy was to rely on economic sanctions to force Hussein out of Kuwait ; U.S. officials claimed that American troops were dispatched only to defend Saudi Arabia . Later this fall , however , the administration realized that " its sanctions policy was much less effective than it had hoped or predicted , ' says Senator Richard Lugar , an Indiana Republican with close ties to the White House . He adds that the administration realized that its international coalition was " not sustainable over a long period of time . ' Moreover , domestic support for the President continued to sink . <p> With his policy crumbling , Bush sent 200,000 more troops to the Gulf , declared they could be used to attack the Iraqis and began pushing for a U.N . resolution authorizing military action . But his efforts to frighten Hussein also frightened the American public and his allies . <p> To quiet those fears , Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In exchange for supporting the U.N . resolution , the French , Soviets and others insisted that Washington launch a new diplomatic offensive and won commitments from Baker to consider accepting a Mideast peace conference , which Israel steadfastly opposes . Last week , Soviet U.N . Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov told Lugar the Palestinian question is " unfinished business " and said he strongly favors a conference . <p> Bush 's strategy , says Lugar , is to allow a conference to proceed while denying any link to the Gulf crisis . But when word got out that the U.S. might not veto the conference , and with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir due in Washington , the administration retreated and withdrew - perhaps only temporarily - its tacit acceptance of the conference . <p> But as Bush prepares to meet Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and Baker plans to visit Baghdad , the administration 's military campaign has been sidetracked , though not derailed , and the diplomatic express will be impossible to stop and difficult to slow . The White House insists it will only repeat its demands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control the agenda for the meetings or the public-relations circus surrounding them . Georgia Senator Sam Nunn argues that Bush already has blinked . " They were talking at one time about war-crimes trials , and they were talking about greatly reducing his military capacity and all of that , ' says Nunn . " I think they 've already backed up . ' <p> Role reversal . The administration takes heart from a Washington Post/ABC News poll in which 63 percent said they would back war " at some point " if Iraq refuses to withdraw from Kuwait . But the poll 's vague question masks fears that the U.S. is moving too fast toward war . In a Gallup survey , only 24 percent said Bush " should quickly begin military action against Iraq ' and 70 percent said he should " wait to see if sanctions are effective . ' Curiously , in congressional hearings administration officials attacked their own sanctions policy while critics supported it . <p> Nunn says the administration undermined its own policy by refusing to rotate troops and failing to push Saudi Arabia to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Nunn , the White House has created " self-imposed " pressures to attack before morale withers and economic suffering grows . ( See story , page 49 . ) The pleas to show Hussein a united front were rejected . " People learned from Vietnam , " says Senator Carl Levin ( D-Mich. ) , " that if they feel we 're on a wrong course , they should say it and not be silent . ' <p> But a diplomatic deal would leave Iraq with the largest conventional armed forces in the region , as well as ballistic missiles , chemical weapons and a nascent nuclear threat . " The most important question if he withdraws from Kuwait will be whether the sanctions and the embargo stay on , ' says a Saudi Arabian official . " If they do , then we 've won and he wo n't last more than another year . If they do n't , then we 've lost . ' <p> The question , simply , is whether Iraq 's military power can be neutralized without destroying it . Optimists suggest that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power can keep the peace in the wake of a political settlement . " Since August 2 , Iraq 's neighbors are going to take a very different view of Iraq , ' says Joseph Nye of Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government . " You have Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak talking about the need to form an alliance between Syria , Saudi Arabia and Egypt . Some of the job of containment will be taken up by states in the region . ' William Quandt of the Brookings Institution says Hussein 's chemical weapons and long-range missiles can be checkmated by Israel , Egypt , Syria and Iran , all of which have chemical weapons and missiles , too . <p> Quandt suggests that a permanent force of 10,000-20,000 U.S. troops in Kuwait and the Gulf , supplemented by Arabs and perhaps even a token Soviet force , could provide a " tripwire " to prevent a repeat of the August 2 invasion . " We can tell our people the Americans are leaving ; it just may take them three to four years to leave , ' says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50,000 to 100,000 troops " distributed in Saudi Arabia and around the Gulf . ' <p> We shall return . Pentagon officials have been exploring the option of leaving behind large amounts of U.S. military equipment - especially heavy equipment such as tanks - on one of the islands off Oman or in Saudi Arabia . By eliminating the need for another time-consuming sealift , such pre-positioned stores would carry the threat of a quick U.S. return in the event of a new crisis . An expanded U.S. naval and air presence in the Gulf also could be part of the deterrent . <p> The optimists also suggest that tight controls over arms shipments to Iraq ultimately could be more effective than air strikes in ending Iraq 's military capability . " If you bomb Iraq and do n't put in an effective control over weapons , then you will have achieved nothing by the bombing , ' argues defense analyst Edward Luttwak of the Center for Strategic and International Studies . " If , on the other hand , you put in such controls , then what he has left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces depend heavily on foreign parts and technical assistance . Iran , which beginning in 1979 found itself the object of a far-from-perfect U.S. embargo ( ' Operation Staunch ' ' ) , had to strip aircraft for spare parts , and even so was forced to fly combat missions in aircraft lacking some radar and avionics . <p> ' Iraq 's indigenous capability is very limited , ' says Anthony Cordesman , a student of the Iran-Iraq War . " It 's mainly in light weapons and ammunition . ' <p> Although Iraq has shown considerable technical resourcefulness - installing its own upgraded electronics into outmoded Soviet-supplied T-55 tanks , for example , and modifying Soviet Scud missiles to extend their range - the country lacks a basic industrial infrastructure . " They do n't have a lot of metal-bending industry , ' says Patrick Clawson , an expert on the Iraqi economy . " What they have is refrigerator-assembly plants . ' <p> An effective embargo , says Cordesman , " would convert Iraq into the world 's largest military parking lot . ' CIA Director William Webster said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose capability within three months and its ground forces within nine months , if the current embargo holds . <p> Saudi officials say the legal basis for maintaining an embargo even after the Kuwait issue is resolved is contained in a U.N . resolution that calls for Iraq to pay reparations to Kuwait . U.S. officials suggest that existing export controls could be strengthened to ensure that Iraq 's missile and nuclear programs do not advance . <p> One step would be to enlist the Soviets and Chinese in the Missile Technology Control Regime , a seven-nation agreement to limit the spread of ballistic-missile technology . Luttwak says it would not be hard to block critical parts , even for Iraq 's nuclear program . For example , maraging steels , needed for centrifuges that separate fissionable uranium-235 from uranium ore , are made only by a few small firms that are easy to watch . <p> Holes in the embargo . But such schemes run into two problems : Cheating and international business as usual . Iraq 's nuclear program is already subject to twice-a-year inspections by the International Atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and materials , such as 12 kilograms of highly enriched uranium that France supplied to Iraq . Although that material theoretically might be barely enough to make one bomb ( the Hiroshima bomb required at least 40 kg ; to use less requires a much more sophisticated design ) , the real worry is Iraq 's clandestinely acquired technology and uranium ore . A proposal to allow IAEA inspectors to visit any suspect site fell victim to a Third World-vs. - First World wrangle at a conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in September . <p> At the same time , some of Hussein 's most menacing hardware is unlikely to be affected by an embargo . Iraq 's chemical and biological-weapons capability is too far along to be stopped ; Iraq has a mature chemical industry . And as defense expert Joseph Braddock of BDM Corporation notes , the liquid-fueled Scud missiles " have a relatively long shelf life . They are complex but not like an airplane that requires service every day . ' <p> Retired Israeli Lt. Gen. Aharon Levran , an authority on the regional military balance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hussein to be a " chutzpanik " who thinks he can bully his neighbors . If a political settlement sidesteps the issue , Israel and its own imposing arsenal may prove to be the ultimate deterrent to Hussein 's ambitions . <p> Drawing : No caption ( Steve Benson for USN &WR); <p> Picture : No sale .

Roberts <p> With Stephen Budiansky <p> TWO SMOOTH OPERATORS Hussein 's messengers <p> Wars , as America has learned , can be won or lost in Congress and on television as well as on the battlefield , and missiles and chemical weapons are not the only potent weapons in Iraq 's arsenal . As the Persian Gulf crisis moves , at least temporarily , into a diplomatic phase , Saddam Hussein can deploy some talented diplomats : Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and Nizar Hamdoon , former ambassador to the U.S. , are both seasoned performers who can exploit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aziz and Hamdoon climbed the unforgiving ranks of Iraqi politics largely because of their ability to court and cajole the West . But beneath their pin-striped suits , excellent English and seemingly moderate political positions are two calculating and ruthless individuals . <p> Before arriving in Washington in 1983 , Hamdoon was a Ba'ath Party official - and reputed intelligence officer - whose specialty was the rival Syrian Ba'ath Party . According to Howard Teicher , a member of President Reagan 's National Security Council staff , " No one would handle the Syrian account for the Iraqi Ba'ath Party unless he was very ruthless . ' <p> Hamdoon 's greatest talent , however , is his ability to manipulate public opinion . During one dinner party at the Iraqi Embassy in Washington , Hamdoon distributed maps that he claimed were taken from a captured Iranian soldier showing plans for an Iranian advance on Jerusalem . Shireen Hunter , deputy director of Middle East Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , recalls that no one questioned the obviously dubious logistics of such a venture . People had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' says Hunter . <p> Tariq Aziz is cut from the same cloth . Intelligent , well-dressed and articulate - and a member of Iraq 's tiny Christian minority - he " gives the West what it wants to hear , ' says Teicher . But those who know Aziz fear that he will turn his visit to Washington into a global media bonanza for the beleaguered Iraqi regime . <p> ' In the atmosphere of a dramatic meeting , with the whole world holding its breath , it will be much harder for us to deflect deceptive proposals , ' says former National Security Council staffer Peter Rodman . <p> Picture : Clever messenger . Iraq 's Tariq Aziz ( A. Nogues-SYGMA ) <p> By Douglas Pasternak <p> ISRAEL 'S WORST NIGHTMARE Left holding the bag ? <p> Dateline : Jerusalem <p> Having been told for months to lie low , Israel now worries it may be left holding the bag . In his meetings with President Bush this week , Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is expected to express support for U.S. policy in the Gulf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the political and military fallout of a possible deal between Baghdad and Washington . Israel is the only state singled out by Saddam Hussein for mass destruction , and if the U.S. does not remove the Iraqi threat , Israel may have to do so itself if it feels threatened . Israeli officials also see problems they will face after any diplomatic solution : <p> Respect for Syria . The most belligerent of the Arab states bordering Israel has been transformed from an untouchable sponsor of terrorism to an ally against Iraq . Without protest , Syria also has taken over Lebanon , and it is also somewhat richer due to Saudi assistance and doubling of oil prices . <p> Guns for Saudi Arabia . The U.S. has authorized a $7.3 billion sale of M1A2 tanks , Apache attack helicopters and other high-tech hardware . An additional $14 billion in weaponry is still in the pipeline . <p> Victory for Iraq . A partial withdrawal from Kuwait will give Hussein victory no matter what its shape . Israeli officials fear he will emerge a political hero , his rejectionism seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderation and his Saladin image in the occupied territories further burnished , inflaming the intifada . A military defeat of Iraq , on the other hand , might bring tougher U.S. pressure on the Palestinian issue because the military threat to Israel will have diminished and the U.S. may seek to rehabilitate its image in the Arab world by pressing for concessions from Israel . <p> Israelis are n't too worried that the U.S. will concede anything to Iraq on the Palestinian issue - yet . Even U.S. moves to support calls for an international conference on the Arab-Israeli conflict are seen as little cause for concern . Israeli officials have been reassured privately that the U.S. is committed to a plan that would move forward in parallel with so-called confidence-building measures , embryonic security arrangements with Arab states formulated at a Mideast security conference . <p> Another way the U.S. could assuage Israeli fears is with the other major item on the agenda for the Shamir-Bush talks : Billions in U.S.-backed housing-loan guarantees Israel needs to handle the influx of Soviet Jewish immigrants .
