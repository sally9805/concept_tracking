What 's wrong with real estate ? Not much , as far as homeowners and commercial landlords are concerned . In much of the country , houses are going for their asking price and office rents are rising faster than inflation . Last year demand for new office space exceeded supply by 35% . Barring a weak economy , fundamentals are likely to remain strong . <P> So what 's wrong with real estate ? Plenty . Anyone who sunk money into publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trusts , or REITs , has been scorched badly . Last year the average REIT stock sank 17% while the Standard &; Poor 's 500 soared 27% , and REITs ' dismal showing has extended into early 1999 . Never have REITs lagged the market by such a wide margin . They 're more out of favor than a home with peeling paint and shag carpets . <P> The recent woeful results stand a couple of basic premises on their ear : namely , that high dividend yields ( around 7.5% ) make REITs an anchor in choppy markets ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate companies will somehow smooth the industry 's masochistic boom-bust cycle  --  making REITs less volatile . Wrong . <P> REITs are investment companies that finance , own or operate commercial properties , including offices , malls , apartments and hotels . By law , they must pay out 95% of their rental and other income as dividends in exchange for certain tax advantages . REITs have flourished in the ' 90s as developers have sold shares into the bull market to raise capital instead of using banks and pension funds . Investors viewed these publicly traded stocks as a quick way in and out of the real estate game . <P> But a surprising backlash has developed . For starters , sporting a big dividend yield on turn-of-the-millennium Wall Street is like going to school with a KICK ME sign stuck to your back . You 'll probably get pummeled . Investors want growth and capital gain . Period . That 's apparent in today 's fury to own money-losing , dividendless Internet and other tech stocks . Meanwhile , there is some question whether the rash of REITs will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes like this : with many real estate companies dependent on stock sales to fund projects , Wall Street becomes a long-sought governor over the industry . Just when there is a danger of overbuilding , REIT shares should fall and limit the industry 's ability to raise money and build to damaging excess . <P> The irony is that taming the real estate cycle appears to be transferring volatility from the value of the properties to the value of the REITs ' shares . Take last summer . Fears of overbuilding began to creep into the news , and REITs were trashed like a wormy apple . The quick , severe reaction had the desired effect . Hotel starts fell 21% in October , 48% in November and 42% in December . The slowdown jolted supply and demand into balance , keeping projected vacancies down , rents and earnings up .
