Instead he gestured toward Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen to respond for him , adding with a laugh , " The great thing about having a Cabinet . . . " The sentence was incomplete , but the thought was clear : having chosen a team , the President-elect was no longer alone . <P> Bentsen , 71 and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , was the capstone as Treasury Secretary . Accenting his desire to work with Congress , Clinton tapped Leon Panetta , who chairs the House Budget Committee , as OMB director . Wall Street was represented by Robert Rubin as the head of the new National Economic Council in the White House , and Roger Altman , a Clinton college classmate , as Bentsen 's deputy . Alice Rivlin , former director of the Congressional Budget Office , will be Panetta 's deputy . The solid choices signaled Clinton 's concern with the deficit and need to reassure business . <P> Clinton 's demeanor on Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( save Altman ) represented a generation older than his own . How different his mood on Friday , when he was surrounded by appointees whom he genuinely enjoys and who fit his vow of " a new generation of leaders . " Harvard political economist Robert Reich , a Rhodes scholar with Clinton , will be Secretary of Labor . Health and Human Services went to Donna Shalala , chancellor of the University of Wisconsin and a friend of Hillary Clinton 's . Another woman becomes chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers : Laura D'Andrea Tyson , a Berkeley economist . And Carol Browner , a former aide to Al Gore , will head the Environmental Protection Agency . Saturday was another day for allies : as Secretary of Commerce , Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron Brown , who aided Clinton with black voters ; and as White House chief of staff , Thomas ( " Mack " ) McLarty , a Clinton kindergarten classmate , gubernatorial campaign treasurer and chief executive of a major natural-gas utility , Arkla , Inc . <P> So far , Clinton shows scant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been skeptical about the President-elect 's oft promised middle-class tax cut , and Rivlin departs from Clinton orthodoxy with her suggestion that states should run public-works programs . Perhaps this will be a combative Administration after all . ( See related story on page 37. )
