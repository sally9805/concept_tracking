The Last Interview <p> When he was up , he was the evangelical of joyful rebellion , a politics needed more than ever here in the nervous ' 90s . But when he was down , all the way down , ABBIE HOFFMAN could n't imagine living even more happy day . <p> IT WAS BARELY A QUARTER AFTER SIX WHEN THE BLEARY-EYED innkeeper knocked on my door and said there was an urgent telephone call from Abbie Hoffman . I had said good-bye to Abbie just five hours earlier , following a marathon twelve-hour interview at his home in New Hope , Pennsylvania , and I was n't supposed to see him again until ten that morning . I stumbled down the hall to the phone and mumbled hello . <p> " There 's been a change of plans . You have to drive me to the hospital in New York , " he announced , his voice subdued yet insistent . " How soon can you be here ? " <p> Abbie had been in pain the day before  --  a car accident ten days earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having run out of painkillers , he could walk only by using a pool cue as a crutch  --  but he had n't let on how debilitating it was . Certainly the pain had not inhibited his mouth ; he had talked a mile a minute for hours-discursive , trenchant , often hilarious monologues that seemed to amuse him as much as they did me . To understand the sixties , he explained , " You have to laugh with us , at us , and take us seriously all at the same time or you 're going to miss the point . " The cocaine bust that drove him underground in 1974 , he claimed , was a police ambush : " I 'm not saying I was n't there , but both things are true  --  the police set me up , and I was there . " Recalling Watergate plumber G. Gordon Liddy , with whom he 'd recently crossed swords on the college lecture circuit , he mused : " It 's interesting to debate someone who had a plan to drug and kidnap you prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got some problems ! And some really quick solutions . Damnit , the trains are going to run on time ! " <p> Bouncing over hilly , twisting country roads , I reached the converted turkey coop where Abbie lived , shortly before seven o'clock . Inside , I found him on the living-room floor , crawling around on all fours like an arthritic infant , gathering belongings for the journey , He did not greet me or thank me for coming , but sent me to the bedroom to retrieve some shirts , and told me to pack the assembled items into his travel bag . On the drive into the city , despite  --  or perhaps because of-the pain , Abbie was again a chatterbox , a bundle of nonstop verbal energy , who quieted down ( somewhat ) only while we listened to a tape of his recent stand-up comedy routine , which critics had panned . When we finally pulled up to the emergency-room entrance some two hours later , he motioned a white-coated orderly over to the car and blurted : " I 'm Abbie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within minutes , he was in a wheelchair being pulled backward into the hospital , laughing and wisecracking all the way . <p> It was months before I understood what had really been going on that day in July 1988 . Like most famous , driven people , Abbie Hoffman was used to the world revolving around him , used to having others do his bidding . He had been remarkably ill mannered during our interview , seeming to hear little but the sound of his own voice . By his own admission , Abbie had been in " performance mode " throughout our interview , but a force darker than celebrity was at work that day as well . <p> Abbie Hoffman was a manic-depressive . Manic depression is known informally as " the genius disease , " because the people it strikes are often distinguished by extraordinary creativity and accomplishment . Van Gogh , Lincoln , and Churchill are presumed to have been manic-depressives . So was one of Abbie 's key role models , Lenny Bruce . The disease is technically known as a bipolar disorder , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims into bursts of frenzied , superhuman activity , then plunging them into paralyzing , unfathomable gloom . When Johanna Lawrenson , Abbie 's companion during the last fifteen years of his life , mentioned long after the fact that Abbie had been " manic as a hatter " when she finally met him at the hospital that day , his monstrous self-absorption during the previous eighteen hours suddenly made tragic sense . So , too , did his decision , nine months later , to end his life . <p> Abbie and I met again for extended interviews in October and December of 1988 and talked numerous times over the phone , but it was only during that first session that we spoke of death . He claimed to have overcome the fear of death while doing civil rights organizing in Mississippi in the early sixties , and said he was " absolutely convinced I 'll be fighting until I die . " Reasoning that to give up one 's life in order to change history was a small sacrifice , he argued passionately that " it 's an honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're not planning to do that anytime soon , are you ? " <p> " Well , I do n't exactly get a choice in the matter , " he replied , emitting the same high-pitched , frantic giggle that punctuated so many of his sentences that day . <p> But he did have a choice , and on April 12,1989 , he exercised it . Alerted by a phone call from Johanna back in New York , whose calls to Abbie had gone unanswered , Michael Waldron , his friend and landlord , entered Abbie 's apartment shortly before 7:00 P.M. and found him lying on his side under the covers of the bed , fully clothed , hands folded beneath his cheek like a dreaming child . According to the coroner 's estimate , Abbie Hoffman had swallowed some 150 phenobarbitals  --  enough to kill ten men  --  and washed them down with alcohol . <p> The body was cremated . The ashes came to rest in a brown plastic box , which Johanna keeps atop the television set in her tiny Manhattan apartment  --  a spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would doubtless feel at home . Next to the ashes is a bag of the black licorice sticks that Abbie craved and a photo of him with his brother , Jack , taken on Thanksgiving Day 1986 . On top of the ashes , completing the shrine , is a hand-carved figurine that Abbie had purchased a year before in Mexico , the land where he and Johanna met and traveled early in his underground period . Small enough to cup in one 's palm , it is a haunting icon : a hooded skeletal-faced figure stands astride the front of a black dugout canoe , relentlessly poling it downstream , while , in back , a shoeless man in a white shirt and blue pants sits placidly , awaiting deliverance to his final resting place . <p> ESPECIALLY AFTER A SUICIDE , IT IS EASY TO FOCUS SO MUCH on the death itself that the life that preceded it gets shortchanged . That would be a real mistake in Abbie Hoffman 's case , for he was alive on the planet in a way that few people ever are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to urge Abbie to learn to sit still and gain meditative wisdom , but it was a hopeless venture : " He had respect for it , and he actually sat once , but he did n't really take to it , " Ginsberg recalled with a smile . Anita Hoffman , Abbie 's second wife and the woman with whom he spent the high-profile years of the late sixties and early seventies , remembers a country stroll with friends one weekend when suddenly Abbie skipped to the side of the road and began tightrope walking along a murderously steep precipice . Anita was terrified , but Abbie merely laughed and merrily tiptoed on . There was no point in trying to rein in such impulses . " That 's just the way he was , " she told me . <p> Abbie told me he was n't sure that he believed in destiny , but he did see life as a cosmic play in which he shared the stage with other archetypal characters , acting out the eternal themes of good and evil . " There 's always going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be the governor who double-crosses the people , and there has to be a me . If there is n't a me , " he laughed , " we 're in big trouble . " <p> As he did with most things in life , Abbie saw the humor even in his disease . According to Jonathan Silvers , who collaborated with him on his last two books , Abbie used to joke that , " If I were n't a manic-depressive , I 'd probably have been just another salesman in Queens . " David Fenton , a friend and public-relations expert who handled Abbie 's emergence from underground and who has observed manic-depressive behavior within his own family , thinks it " pretty unquestionable that some of his sixties genius and superenergy were linked to the illness . " <p> National recognition first came to Abbie Hoffman in April 1967 , when he and a dozen other free spirits hurled dollar bills from the gallery of the New York Stock Exchange . Later that year , Abbie , Anita , and a cast of fifty thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exorcise its evil spirits . In 1968 , while leading street protests against the Democratic National Convention , Hoffman , Jerry Rubin , and five others were charged with conspiracy to incite riot ; the Chicago Seven case subsequently became the most famous political trial of the decade . Sentenced to jail for wearing an American flag as a shirt in 1969 , Abbie solemnly informed the court , " Your honor , I regret that I have but one shirt to give for my country . " <p> If such high jinks caused some to dismiss him as a lighthearted prankster , Abbie himself saw them as potent strategic strikes in a war for the U.S. consciousness , a war of symbols and images fought through the media . He properly regarded television as magic , and quickly learned to make it do tricks . He intuitively recognized the medium 's requirements for sound bites , action pictures , and minidramas well before the Roger Aileses and Michael Deavers of the world began using such devices to elect Republican presidents . As Tom Carson observed in the L.A. Weekly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone watched . If this sounds shallow , think of what might well have happened if the antiwar movement had not become a TV show . " <p> Abbie did love an audience , but the critique that he was more interested in self-promotion than in social change overlooks his actual history as an activist . Abbie was doing the decidedly unglamorous work of the local political organizer  --  campaigning for civil rights in the South and against the war in his hometown of Worcester , Massachusetts  --  well before the cameras arrived , and he kept at it for the rest of his life , most remarkably in his incognito efforts in the late seventies to prevent environmental desecration of the St. Lawrence River . " I have never seen myself as anything more than a good community organizer , " he later wrote . " It was just the Vietnam War that made the community bigger , that 's all . " <p> Though unabashedly a man of the Left , Abbie distrusted isms , seeing them as reflections and enforcers of dogmatic and anachronistic thinking . Rooted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood , where he learned fistfighting and pool-hall hustling and developed an enduring empathy with the underdog and outsider . Disobeying rules seems to have been gut instinct ; his father was but the first of countless authority figures with whom he clashed . ( When a reporter asked him in the sixties , " What are you rebelling against ? " Abbie cracked , " Waddaya got ? " ) Yet for all his militancy , he was at heart almost naively idealistic and patriotic . He loved his country despite its faults , and expected it to live up to its ideals . He insisted on personal responsibility . " We are here to make a better world , " he wrote in his autobiography . " No amount of rationalization can avoid the moment of choice each of us brings to our situation here on the planet . I still believe in the fundamental injustice of the profit system and do not accept the proposition there will be rich and poor for all eternity . " Like all romantics , he was doomed to ultimate disappointment . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anita , with whom he remained close , he sounded tired , and frustrated by the slow progress and lack of support for some of his projects : " I just want to do what has to be done so much . I 'll never understand why everyone else does n't feel the same way . " <p> For Abbie , opposing the status quo was not simply morally right , but intoxicatingly exciting . Perhaps his most important contribution to politics was the wholly original , charmingly American notion that revolution could be fun . Fun was not the same thing as pleasure ; obviously , making revolution took hard work and sacrifice . But why not have some kicks along the way ? After all , the prospect of a good time promised to attract more people to the movement than the dour-faced appeals of the traditional Left . What 's more , to laugh in the face of authority was itself a subversive act . <p> " We were hedonists together , as opposed to the puritanical , dogmatic tefties , " said Anita . She recalled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He had this homey , romantic side to him with the women in his life  --  cooking and gardening  --  that was private and nice . " Still , it was n't easy living with such a public person . Although he doubtless loved his kids , Abbie was not exactly a hands-on kind of father , nor a great provider . As a full-time organizer , he had neither the time nor the inclination to work a paycheck job . He had two children , Andrew and Amy , with his first wife , Shiela . He and Anita had a son , america , in 1971 . All three of the kids and both ex-wives spent time on welfare . Yet Anita emphasized that she always saw Abbie as generous , noting that when he sold the movie rights to his life story , he divided the proceeds among his three wives , which gave her $38,000 to relocate with america to Seattle . " I did n't want him to go get a job , " she added . " I wanted him to do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and organize them . " <p> " He 's a strange archetype to have as a father , " america told me the summer before his father died . Although america clearly respected his dad 's political work and principles , he also seemed frustrated by the paucity of personal time he was able to spend with him . During his annual visits , he usually found Abbie so busy that " there might be an hour or so that I really get to talk to him . " America , who is now attending a technical college in California , bears a striking physical resemblance to his father , but does not plan to devote his life to full-time political protest . <p> Abbie himself had mixed feelings about fame . Clearly , he enjoyed being the center of attention . " Modesty , " he told me , " is a WASP trait . " Besides , being famous opened doors to new experiences and other high-powered people . It was n't every antiwar activist who palled around with John Lennon . " I thought I was famous until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was n't just that he was a Beatle . He was the one who had the Japanese wife , so you could really spot him easy . " According to Abbie , it was not fame alone that drew him to John , however . " Lennon wanted to he a working-class hero . He had a very strong sense of struggle , " he argued . Pointing to a photo on his wall that Anita had taken of Abbie and Jerry Rubin with John and Yoko Ono in 1971 , he cracked , " You do n't see me up there with McCartney , do you ? " <p> As heady as fame was , it eventually began to wear , even on Abbie . " When I went underground , " he explained , " it was n't so much that I was tired of being Abbie Hoffman as that it was impossible to live up to the expectations of the people I came in contact with . They were n't looking for a human being . They wanted something more . " <p> IN HIS BEST-SELLING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freaks that , " If you ever have the slightest doubt about the person with whom you 're dealing  --  DO N'T . " So how could he have been foolhardy enough to participate , in 1973 , in a major cocaine deal with people he did n't know , some of whom turned out to be undercover cops ? Abbie danced around the question in his autobiography . In interviews with me , he essentially complained that the cops had played him dirty  --  he , who as a street fighter from way back , had always fought as dirty as necessary . He did tell me he stood to make " about $2,000 ... for bringing together two parties who did n't trust each other . " If convicted under New York 's newly tightened drug laws , he faced the possibility of spending a good fifteen to twenty years in Attica . Even Abbie , a notorious fudger of the truth , calculated his odds of beating the rap at only slightly better than fifty-fifty . So he decided to make a run for it , dropping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most famous people in the United States had to become anonymous . He got his hair straightened and dyed . Posing as an aging Canadian TV personality , he had his face made over by a plastic surgeon in Los Angeles . He assembled documents and background stories to support a variety of new identities . Behavior had to change as well . " I had to train myself to talk with my hands tied behind my back , to not look people in the eye , to not give fascinating answers to questions , to not draw attention to myself in any way , " he recalled . <p> He headed for Mexico to lie low . Settling in Guadalajara under the alias Mark Summers , he taught English to schoolchildren by having them read one of his favorite books , Anne Frank : The Diary of a Young Girl . ( The Anne Frank House , in Amsterdam , was sacred to Abbie , one of only two places where he signed his real name while underground ; the other was Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata 's birthplace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an international fashion model he 'd once met at a party in the Hamptons was in Mexico City on a photo shoot . He decided to telephone her and , impersonating a magazine photo director , offer her a second assignment in Guadalajara . " At some point in the conversation , " he recounted , " I break voice and say , ' I 'm someone who 's in trouble who you met at a party in Long Island . ' And something in her clicks ; she knows exactly who I am , and says , ' I will be there in five days . ' " He had her met at the airport and driven to a resort outside of town . As she stood waiting to check in , he slipped into line behind her and murmured , " How nice to see you , Mrs. Summers . Everything will be taken care of . " As they talked in her room upstairs , his intuition that this woman could be trusted grew . He told her that , reddish hair , mustache , and eyeglasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirming what she already strongly suspected . <p> Meeting Johanna was a godsend ; it was not for nothing that he came to call her Angel . Years later , loved ones would say that without Johanna , Abbie would have been dead or arrested long ago . He himself told me , " She was the perfect running mate for me . She was tall , big , and immaculately beautiful , so everybody was always looking at her instead of me . " <p> Although much in demand on both sides of the Atlantic throughout the sixties  --  Man Ray , for example , asked to photograph her in 1962  --  Johanna Lawrenson was hardly the stereotypical airhead fashion model . Her family background was , in fact , both literary and left-wing . Her father had helped found the National Maritime Union ; as a girl , it had been Johanna 's job to scoop her dad 's copies of I. E Stone 's Weekly off the coffee table when the FBI agents dropped by for their semiannual visits . Her mother , Helen , had authored five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Latins Are Lousy Lovers " and " How Now , Fellatio ! Why Dost Thou Tarry ? " <p> Over the next three years , Abbie and Johanna spent most of their time traveling around Mexico and Central America , falling in love with indigenous Indian culture and each other . " In many ways , the time underground was the easiest part of our lives , " Johanna recalled . " We did n't have the fame factor to deal with , and he was still the creative , dynamic , political guy that he always was . " <p> Then , in August 1978 , Abbie and Johanna decided to take a chance . They had returned from Europe to live in a remote part of upstate New York , in a cottage her great-grandmother had built on one of the Thousand Islands dotting the St. Lawrence River . Abbie was calling himself Barry Freed ( as in free-ed ) , a former television scriptwriter . A local carpenter came by one day with pamphlets describing a plan by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to dredge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like an economic boondoggie of mammoth proportions , not to mention an ecological nightmare . The shoreline would be ruined , the wetlands devastated , and all so that U.S. Steel could acquire its own aquatic driveway , courtesy of U.S. taxpayers . <p> " We took the pamphlet upstairs and had a long discussion about it , what it would mean to take this issue on , " Johanna told me . " We knew it would greatly increase our chances of getting caught , but we decided to take that risk . " Along with a few friends , " Barry " and Johanna founded Save the River , a citizens ' group that eventually succeeded in blocking the project . While the FBI continued searching for Abbie Hoffman , newspapers were publishing photos of concerned environmentalist Barry Freed testifying before lawmakers in Albany and Washington , D.C. He received a letter of commendation from Governor Hugh Carey and public praise from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan . It was , by necessity , a private joke , but it tasted very sweet . <p> Life underground was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous and constant . Abbie told me that every political fugitive he knew eventually cracked from the strain of the schizophrenic life-style . Abbie 's first breakdown came in April 1975 in a Las Vegas hotel room . Recovering from a ghastly hemorrhoid operation while racing with Johanna to keep one step ahead of the law , he suddenly came completely unglued . He was sure the television set was talking to him , certain that the surgeons had implanted a transmitting device during the operation , convinced that people were watching him through a two-way mirror . <p> Like an earthquake , the Las Vegas crack-up had aftershocks . Although he was not formally diagnosed a manic-depressive until early 1980 , most people close to Abbie thought it was his going underground that activated the depressive side of the disease . In 1976 , convinced his cover had been blown by a careless reporter from Playboy , he flew into a maniacal rage of energy that sent him crisscrossing the country , taking dangerous chances just for the hell of it , as if he wanted to get caught . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fancy Chinese restaurant in New York , and he was just bouncing off the walls , " recalled David Fenton . " He insisted on inviting a reporter from the New York Post . And we were horrified . Thank god Johanna finally got him out of there . " <p> Abbie eventually spun out of his manic cycle , only to plunge into darkness . " I cried uncontrollably , " he later wrote , " realizing that I had chased away everyone I loved and prepared for self-annihilation .... I craved death but lacked the energy or initiative to do the deed . " <p> Abbie finally turned himself in to the authorities on September 4 , 1980 . He could n't stay under forever , and with the country apparently moving to the right  --  the election of Ronald Reagan was appearing more and more likely  --  he figured he 'd probably get a better deal from authorities if he acted quickly . In typical Abbie Hoffman style , he announced his return via a nationally televised interview with Barbara Walters . <p> ABBIE SERVED ABOUT ELEVEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in Manhattan , where he fulfilled his remaining obligation to the state by working in a drug-treatment program . This experience led him to write , with Jonathan Silvers , Steal This Urine Test , a politically courageous book that attacked the current anti-drug hysteria without whitewashing the problem . He hit the college lecture circuit , speaking out against U.S. policy in Central America and encouraging opposition to CIA campus recruitment . And throughout these years , he was deeply involved in efforts to halt nuclear development of the Delaware River , the struggle that drew him to settle in the Pennsylvania town of New Hope . Abbie said it made him feel patriotic to fight for land and water and that he liked battles that taught people how democracy did and did n't work . And here was a struggle taking place in the very birthplace of American democracy . George Washington made his famous crossing of the Delaware just miles from where the Philadelphia Electric Company now wanted to build a huge water pump . Moreover , it was in the nearby town of Solesbury that Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Common Sense . At the No Regrets Day memorial service held for Abbie in New York last June 17 , he was eulogized as " the Thomas Paine of our era . " Like Paine , Abbie was a gifted propagandist and internationalist who lived the life of a permanent revolutionary . Just as Paine had gone on from the American Revolution to defend the revolution in France , and later , to agitate against the king of England , so had Abbie dived back into full-time political mischief making after the sixties movement faded away . Unlike so many of his contemporaries , he refused to accept that an active social idealism was incompatible with adulthood . <p> " I do n't know why that is , " he told me . " I 'm as fascinated by the psychological aspects of it as anybody . Looking back on some of the sixties documentaries , I 'd think that Abbie Hoffman would have been one of the first to sell out , because he was creative and funny . Holly wood or an ad agency would have swallowed him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone went through changing identities during the seventies , but I had to do it in a much more dramatic fashion . And as I searched for the real me among these twelve or thirteen different identities , I noticed that each one kept the politics . " <p> In the eighties , Abbie repeatedly passed up opportunities to make lots of money and , in keeping with longstanding habit , gave away much of what he did earn . At the same time , he was uncomfortable being cast in the role of moral yardstick . Not only did it romanticize who he was , but it was a misreading of history that allowed people to justify their own apathy in the present . In 1988 , he attended the Toronto film festival , where the documentary called Growing Up in America was screened . The film contrasted what certain radicals had done in the sixties with Where They Are Now . " To the average viewer , " Abbie told me , " a lot of these radicals are going to look like they , quote , sold out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , going on trial against the CIA , et cetera . So when the movie ends , there 's a thousand people from all over the world applauding me . And I get up and say , ' Wait a second . Everyone in this movie went to jail for what they believed in , and that was n't true of everyone in that generation . ' I was trying to get that audience to think , Before you throw stones , what are you doing now ? " <p> Abbie made a similar point to those who approached him to trash Tom Hayden , despite his ambivalent feelings about Hayden 's political trajectory as a California state assemblyman . " There were eight thousand people in Chicago on the climactic day in ' 68 , but over the past twenty years I 've met eighty thousand people who swear they were there , " said Abbie . " But I know who was there , and he was . " <p> When it came to his old compatriot Jerry Rubin , however , Abbie 's feelings were both more intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relationship the two of them had dating back to their glory days . Their differences erupted in public during the " Yippie vs . Yuppie " debates of 1985 . Abbie called Jerry a capitalist sellout and accused him of espousing the politics of Ronald Reagan . Jerry argued that times had changed ; it made sense to challenge the government in the sixties , but with the babyboom generation now attaining positions of influence in society , the task in the eighties was to exercise power for good ends . <p> Despite the venom Abbie heaped on him , Jerry maintained after Abbie died that " it 's a one-dimensional picture to say that Abbie had contempt for me . Our partnership went beyond politics . " To prove the point , Jerry told of how , in December 1983 , he and his wife , Mimi , unexpectedly found themselves on the same flight to Mexico that Abbie and Johanna were on . When they encountered each other in the boarding lounge , " We just had to laugh . It was like fate ; we could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly every day over the next three weeks ( a gross exaggeration , according to Johanna ) and that " the love and friendship between us was unmistakable . " But their political differences remained a block . <p> Shortly after Abbie 's death , Jerry trolled the publishing industry for interest in a book about Abbie . Harcourt Brace Jovanovich offered a $400,000 advance , only to rescind the offer after Johanna and Abbie 's brother , Jack , as part of a bare-knuckle campaign to block the book , announced that Abbie 's family would under no circumstances cooperate with Rubin . When I asked Johanna why not , she replied , " Are you kidding ? Abbie would n't have wanted his legacy defined by Jerry Rubin ! " <p> No ONE CAN KNOW WHY ABBIE HOFFMAN killed himself ; he left no note . In all probability , however , it was his disease that killed him . In a taped message to the No Regrets Day service , William Styron , himself a victim of depression , explained : " He put himself to sleep not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any moral dereliction , but because the pain of his suffering was simply more than he could bear .... Suicide in such an instance .. , arises out of blind necessity . " <p> During my last face-to-face conversation with Abbie , over a Japanese dinner with Johanna in December 1988 , I was struck by how tired and beaten down he looked . His conversation was as spirited as ever , but he moved like an old man . Ponderously climbing the five flights of stairs to Johanna 's apartment after dinner , he grumbled about the " foot doctors , flu doctors , ass doctors " now running his life . <p> Things seemed to look up with the coming of the New Year , however . He spent January resting , healing , having dental work done , as if he was planning to be around for a while . He was less distracted by his work , and seemed to respond to people on a gentler , more personal level . But he also began saying things he 'd never said before  --  telling his mother how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done a good job of raising america  --  apparently settling emotional accounts . At the time , recalled Johanna , " I thought I was getting a vision of what the next twenty years would be like . " <p> But during February , Abbie 's newfound mellowness gradually disintegrated into depression . In a letter to Anita in early April , he wrote : " I 've been in an acute depressive episode for almost two months . This is the most I 've written , and I do n't read . I 'm scared to cross the street without Johanna . " <p> Yet Abbie was a keen student of his disease and not the type to succumb without a fight . He had stopped taking lithium in 1985 . The physical side effects were bad enough  --  weight gain , diarrhea , drowsiness  --  but above all , he felt it sapped his creativity and hindered his political effectiveness . During the intervening four years , he used a combination of diazepam , the generic version of Valium , and occasional antidepressants to keep his moods in check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-February , feeling himself slipping further and further into the gloom , he had asked his doctor to prescribe something else . He was given Prozac , which he took for a couple of weeks with no apparent effect . The doctor advised him that Prozac sometimes took four to six weeks to work . Abbie could n't wait that long . <p> None of the loved ones I interviewed were surprised by his suicide . " Abbie was predictably unpredictable , " said Johanna . " I remember hanging up from the phone call with Michael , numb , but thinking , Oh , you did it . I was surprised and I was n't surprised . It was just one more thing that he did . I still have n't accepted it . " <p> The coroner had no sooner issued his ruling than the press delivered its cheap and breezy verdict : Abbie Hoffman had killed himself out of despair that the sixties were n't coming back . It was in keeping with the media 's penchant for quick and formulaic answers that it refused to grant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also a human being with human frailties , and that these frailties may actually have been what brought him down . <p> Clearly , Abbie was discouraged by the right-wing ascendancy of recent years , especially among America 's youth . " Students went three to one for Bush , " he said . " That was the most depressing part of the election for me . " Abbie had remained a student organizer all his life , working hard to keep up on what musical groups and slang were current with today 's college kids . But he did n't really fit in anymore . Some activists found him arrogant and dated . Most kids merely found him a curiosity . " He was not thrilled about doing the college circuit , " said Anita . " He was going there to rouse them , and they were writing term papers on him as an historical artifact . " <p> " Who was his constituency now ? " asked Jeff Nightbyrd , an old organizing buddy . " People who remembered the sixties . Not students ; they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ' agents of change . ' I think it depressed Abbie not to be able to put his hand on the little wheel that turns the big wheel anymore . " <p> These days it 's fashionable to snicker at the sixties as a time of simpleminded , self-indulgent excess , a historical aberration to be ripped off in TV commercials but not repeated in the streets . In such a climate , someone who continued to press for social change as insistently as Abbie Hoffman did was bound to be regarded as a bizarre anachronism . Yet it is a measure of the man 's inner strength that he refused to temper his idealism , despite the dulleyed indifference of a society hurtling headlong in the opposite direction . <p> In his final public appearance , on April 6 , 1989 , at Vanderbilt University , he spoke eloquently about what had actually been accomplished during the sixties . The lesson of that tumultuous decade , he said , was that people who cared enough to do what was right could change history : " In the 1960s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't end racism , but we ended legal segregation . We ended the idea that you can send a million soldiers ten thousand miles away to fight in a war that the people do not support . We ended the idea that women are second-class citizens . Now it does n't matter who sits in the Oval Office . Even George Bush has to talk about child care , the environment .... The big battles that were won in that period of civil war and strife you can not reverse . We were young , we were reckless , we were arrogant , silly , headstrong . And we were right . I regret nothing !
