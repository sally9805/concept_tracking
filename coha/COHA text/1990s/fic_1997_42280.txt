He said he would be at the funeral . No point talking about flights and meeting him at the airport . He intended to drive . Of course he knew how far it was . He had a damn fine car , never had an accident in his life , knock on wood <p> IN the long unfurling of his life , from tight-wound kid hustler in a wool suit riding the train out of Cheyenne to geriatric limper in this spooled-out year , Mero had kicked down thoughts of the place where he began , a socalled ranch on strange ground at the south hinge of the Big Horns . He 'd got himself out of there in 1936 , had gone to a war and come back , married and married again ( and again ) , made money in boilers and air-duct cleaning and smart investments , retired , got into local politics and out again without scandal , never circled back to see the old man and Rollo , bankrupt and ruined , because he knew they were . They called it a ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man said cows could n't be run in such tough country , where they fell off cliffs , disappeared into sinkholes , gave up large numbers of calves to marauding lions ; where hay could n't grow but leafy spurge and Canada thistle throve , and the wind packed enough sand to scour windshields opaque . The old man wangled a job delivering mail , but looked guilty fumbling bills into his neighbors " mailboxes . Mero and Rollo saw the mail route as a defection from the work of the ranch , work that consequently fell on them . The breeding herd was down to eighty-two , and a cow was n't worth more than fifteen dollars , but they kept mending fence , whittling ears and scorching hides , hauling cows out of mudholes , and hunting lions in the hope that sooner or later the old man would move to Ten Sleep with his woman and his bottle and they could , as had their grandmother Olive when Jacob Corn disappointed her , pull the place taut . That bird did n't fly , and Mero wound up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exercycle in the living room of a colonial house in Woolfoot , Massachusetts . One of those damp mornings the nail-driving telephone voice of a woman said she was Louise , Tick 's wife , and summoned him back to Wyoming . He did n't know who she was , who Tick was , until she said , Tick Corn , your brother Rollo 's son , and that Rollo had passed on , killed by a waspy emu , though prostate cancer was waiting its chance . Yes , she said , you bet Rollo still owned the ranch . Half of it anyway . Me and Tick , she said , we been pretty much running it the past ten years . An emu ? Did he hear right ? Yes , she said . Well , of course you did n't know . You heard of Wyoming Down Under ? He had not . And thought , What kind of name is Tick ? He recalled the bloated gray insects pulled off the dogs . This tick probably thought he was going to get the whole damn ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell is this about an emu ? Were they all crazy out there ? That 's what the ranch is called now , she said . Wyoming Down Under . Rollo 'd sold the place way back when to the Girl Scouts , but one of the girls was dragged off by a lion , and the GSA sold out to the Banner ranch , next door , which ran cattle on it for a few years and then unloaded it on a rich Australian businessman , who started Wyoming Down Under , but it was too much long-distance work and he 'd had bad luck with his manager , a feller from Idaho with a pawnshop rodeo buckle , so he 'd looked up Rollo and offered to swap him a half interest if he 'd run the place . That was back in 1978 . The place had done real well . Course we 're not open now , she said . It 's winter and there 's no tourists . Poor Rollo was helping Tick move the emus to another building when one of them turned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ razor claws . Emus is bad for claws . I know , he said . He watched the nature programs on television . She shouted , as though the telephone lines were down all across the country , Tick got your number off the computer . Rollo always said he was going to get in touch . He wanted you to see how things turned out . He tried to fight it off with his cane , but it laid him open from belly to breakfast . Maybe , he thought , things had n't finished turning out . Impatient with this game , he said he would be at the funeral . No point talking about flights and meeting him at the airport , he told her ; he did n't fly , a bad experience years ago with hail , the plane had looked like a waffle iron when it landed . He intended to drive . Of course he knew how far it was . Had a damn fine car , Cadillac , always drove Cadillacs , Gislaved tires , interstate highways , excellent driver , never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four days ; he would be there by Saturday afternoon . He heard the amazement in her voice , knew she was plotting his age , figuring he had to be eighty-three , a year or so older than Rollo , figuring he must be dotting around on a cane , too , drooling the tiny days away-she was probably touching her own faded hair . He flexed his muscular arms , bent his knees , thought he could dodge an emu . He would see his brother dropped in a red Wyoming hole . That event could jerk him back ; the dazzled rope of lightning against the cloud is not the downward bolt but the compelled upstroke through the heated ether . HE had pulled away at the sudden point when the old man 's girlfriend-now he could n't remember her name-seemed to have jumped the track , Rollo goggling at her bloody bitten fingers , nails chewed to the quick , neck veins like wires , the outer forearms shaded with hairs , and the cigarette glowing , smoke curling up , making her wink her bulging mustang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayhem . The old man 's hair was falling out , Mero was twenty-three and Rollo twenty , and she played them all like a deck of cards . If you admired horses , you 'd go for her with her arched neck and horsy buttocks , so high and haunchy you 'd want to clap her on the rear . The wind bellowed around the house , driving crystals of snow through the cracks of the warped log door , and all of them in the kitchen seemed charged with some intensity of purpose . She 'd balanced that broad butt on the edge of the dog-food chest , looking at the old man and Rollo , now and then rolling her glossy eyes over at Mero , square teeth nipping a rim of nail , sucking the welling blood , drawing on her cigarette . The old man drank his Everclear stirred with a peeled willow stick for the bitter taste . The image of him came sharp in Mero 's mind as he stood at the hall closet contemplating his hats . Should he take one for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his hat brim , a tight roll on the right where his doffing or donning hand gripped it , and a wavering downslope on the left like a shed roof . You could recognize him two miles away . He wore it at the table listening to the woman 's stories about Tin Head , steadily emptying his glass until he was nine times nine drunk , his gangstery face loosening , the crushed rodeo nose and scarcrossed eyebrows , the stub ear , dissolving as he drank . Now he must be dead fifty years or more , buried in the mailman sweater . THE girlfriend started a story , Yeah , there was this guy named Tin Head down around Dubois when my dad was a kid . Had a little ranch , some horses , cows , kids , a wife . But there was something funny about him . He had a metal plate in his head from falling down some cement steps . Plenty of guys has them , Rollo said in a challenging way . She shook her head . Not like his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his brain . The old man held up the bottle of Everclear , raised his eyebrows at her : Well , darlin ' ? She nodded , took the glass from him , and knocked it back in one swallow . Oh , that 's not gon na slow me down , she said . Mero expected her to neigh . So what then , Rollo said , picking at the horse manure under his boot heel . What about Tin Head and his galvanized skull plate ? I heard it this way , she said . She held out the glass for another shot of Everclear , and the old man poured it , and she went on . MERO had thrashed all that ancient night , dreamed of horse breeding or hoarse breathing , whether the act of sex or bloody , cutthroat gasps he did n't know . The next morning he woke up drenched in stinking sweat , looked at the ceiling , and said aloud , It could go on like this for some time . He meant cows and weather as much as anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states over in any direction . In Woolfoot , riding the Exercycle , he thought the truth was somewhat different : he 'd wanted a woman of his own , not the old man 's leftovers . What he wanted to know now , tires spanking the tarfilled road cracks and potholes , funeral homburg sliding on the back seat , was if Rollo had got the girlfriend away from the old man , thrown a saddle on her , and ridden off into the sunset . THE interstate , crippled by orange cones , forced traffic into single lanes , broke his expectation of making good time . His Cadillac , boxed between semis with hissing air brakes , showed snuffling huge rear tires in the windshield , framed a looming Peterbilt in the back window . His thoughts clogged as if a comb working through his mind had stuck against a snarl . When the traffic eased and he tried to cover some ground , the highway patrol pulled him over . The cop , a pimpled , moustached specimen with mismatched eyes , asked his name , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think what he was doing there . The cop 's tongue dapped at the scraggy moustache while he scribbled . Funeral , he said suddenly . Going to my brother 's funeral . Well , you take it easy , gramps , or they 'll be doing one for you . You 're a little polecat , are n't you ? he said , staring at the ticket , at the pathetic handwriting , but the moustache was a mile gone , peeling through the traffic as Mero had peeled out of the ranch road that long time ago , squinting through the abraded windshield . He might have made a more graceful exit , but urgency had struck him as a blow on the humerus sends a ringing jolt up the arm . He believed it was the horse-haunched woman leaning against the chest and Rollo fixed on her , the old man swilling Everclear and not noticing or , if noticing , not caring , that had worked in him like a key in an ignition . She had long , gray-streaked braids ; Rollo could use them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and convincing liar 's voice . I 'll tell you , on Tin Head 's ranch things went wrong . Chickens changed color overnight , calves was born with three legs , his kids was piebald and his wife always crying for blue dishes . Tin Head never finished nothing he started , quit halfway through a job every time . Even his pants was half buttoned , so his wienie hung out . He was a mess with the galvy plate eating at his brain , and his ranch and his family was a mess . But , she said , they had to eat , did n't they , just like anybody else ? I hope they eat pies better than the ones you make , said Rollo , who did n't like the mouthful of pits that came with the chokecherries . HIS interest in women had begun a few days after the old man had said , Take this guy up and show him them Ind'an drawrings , jerking his head at the stranger . Mero had been eleven or twelve at the time , no older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of mallards who flew downstream and then suddenly reappeared , pursued by a goshawk who struck the drake with a sound like a handclap . The duck tumbled through the trees and into deadfall trash , and the hawk shot away as swiftly as it had come . They climbed through the stony landscape , limestone beds eroded by wind into fantastic furniture , stale gnawed bread crusts , tumbled bones , stacks of dirty folded blankets , bleached crab claws and dog teeth . He tethered the horses in the shade of a stand of limber pine and led the anthropologist up through the stiff-branched mountain mahogany to the overhang . Above them reared corroded cliffs brilliant with orange lichen , pitted with holes , ridged with ledges darkened by millennia of raptor feces . The anthropologist moved back and forth scrutinizing the stone gallery of red and black drawings : bison skulls , a line of mountain sheep , warriors carrying lances , a turkey stepping into a snare , a stick man upside-down dead and falling , red-ocher hands , violent figures with rakes on their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear dancing forward on its hind legs , concentric circles and crosses and latticework . He copied the drawings in his notebook , saying Rubba-dubba a few times . That 's the sun , said the anthropologist , who resembled an unfinished drawing himself , pointing at an archery target , ramming his pencil into the air as though tapping gnats . That 's an atlatl , and that 's a dragonfly . There we go . You know what this is , and he touched a cloven oval , rubbing the cleft with his dusty fingers . He got down on his hands and knees and pointed out more , a few dozen . A horseshoe ? A horseshoe ! The anthropologist laughed . No , boy , it 's a vulva . That 's what all of these are . You do n't know what this is , do you ? You go to school on Monday and look it up in the dictionary . It 's a symbol , he said . You know what a symbol is ? Yes , said Mero , who had seen them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anthropologist laughed and told him he had a great future , gave him a dollar for showing him the place . Listen , kid , the Indians did it just like anybody else , he said . He had looked the word up in the school dictionary , slammed the book closed in embarrassment , but the image was fixed for him ( with the brassy background sound of a military march ) , blunt ocher tracing on stone , and no fleshly examples ever conquered his belief in the subterranean stony structure of female genitalia , the pubic bone a proof , except for the old man 's girlfriend , whom he imagined down on all fours , entered from behind and whinnying like a mare , a thing not of geology but of flesh . THURSDAY night , balked by detours and construction , he was on the outskirts of Des Moines . In the cinder-block motel room he set the alarm , but his own stertorous breathing woke him before it rang . He was up at fivefifteen , eyes aflame , peering through the vinyl drapes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SLEEP SLEEP . In the bathroom he mixed the packet of instant motel coffee and drank it black , without ersatz sugar or chemical cream . He wanted the caffeine . The roots of his mind felt withered and punky . A cold morning , light snow slanting down : he unlocked the Cadillac , started it , and curved into the vein of traffic , all semis , double and triple trailers . In the headlights " glare he missed the westbound ramp and got into torn-up muddy streets , swung right and right again , using the motel 's SLEEP sign as a landmark , but he was on the wrong side of the interstate , and the sign belonged to a different motel . Another mudholed lane took him into a traffic circle of commuters sucking coffee from insulated cups , pastries sliding on dashboards . Half around the hoop he spied the interstate entrance ramp , veered for it , collided with a panel truck emblazoned STOP SMOKING ! HYPNOSIS THAT WORKS ! , was rammed from behind by a stretch limo , the limo in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickup . He saw little of this , pressed into his seat by the air bag , his mouth full of a rubbery , dusty taste , eyeglasses cutting into his nose . His first thought was to blame Iowa and those who lived in it . There were a few round spots of blood on his shirt cuff . A star-spangled Band-Aid over his nose , he watched his crumpled car , pouring dark fluids onto the highway , towed away behind a wrecker . When the police were through with him , a taxi took him , his suitcase , the homburg funeral hat , in the other direction , to Posse Motors , where lax salesmen drifted like disorbited satellites and where he bought a seconhand Cadillac , black like the wreck but three years older and the upholstery not cream leather but sun-faded velour . He had the good tires from the wreck brought over and mounted . He could do that if he liked , buy cars like packs of cigarettes and smoke them up . He did n't care for the way the Caddy handled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he twitched the wheel , and he guessed it might have a bent frame . Damn . He 'd buy another for the return trip . He could do what he wanted . He was half an hour past Kearney , Nebraska , when the full moon rose , an absurd visage balanced in his rearview mirror , above it a curled wig of a cloud , filamented edges like platinum hairs . He felt his swollen nose , palped his chin , tender from the stun of the air bag . Before he slept that night , he swallowed a glass of hot tap water enlivened with whiskey , crawled into the damp bed . He had eaten nothing all day , but his stomach coiled at the thought of road food . He dreamed that he was in the ranch house but all the furniture had been removed from the rooms and in the yard troops in dirty white uniforms fought . The concussive reports of huge guns were breaking the window glass and forcing the floorboards apart , so that he had to walk on the joists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , coagulated fluid . On Saturday morning , with four hundred miles in front of him , he swallowed a few bites of scorched eggs , potatoes painted with canned salsa verde , a cup of yellow coffee , left no tip , got on the road . The food was not what he wanted . His breakfast habit was two glasses of mineral water , six cloves of garlic , a pear . The sky to the west hulked sullen ; behind him were smears of tinselly orange shot through with blinding streaks . The thick rim of sun bulged against the horizon . He crossed the state line , hit Cheyenne for the second time in sixty years . He saw neon , traffic , and concrete , but he knew the place , a railroad town that had been up and down . That other time he had been painfully hungry , had gone into the restaurant in the Union Pacific station although he was not used to restaurants , and had ordered a steak . When the woman brought it and he cut into the meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't help it , he saw the beast , mouth agape in mute bawling , saw the comic aspects of his revulsion as well , a cattleman gone wrong . Now he parked in front of a phone booth , locked the car although he stood only seven feet away , and telephoned the number Tick 's wife had given him . The ruined car had had a phone . Her voice roared out of the earpiece . We did n't hear so we wondered if you changed your mind . No , he said , I 'll be there late this afternoon . I 'm in Cheyenne now . The wind 's blowing pretty hard . They 're saying it could maybe snow . In the mountains . Her voice sounded doubtful . I 'll keep an eye on it , he said . He was out of town and running north in a few minutes . The country poured open on each side , reduced the Cadillac to a finger snap . Nothing had changed , not a Goddamn thing , the empty pale place and its roaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landforms shaped true to the past . He felt himself slip back ; the calm of eighty-three years sheeted off him like water , replaced by a young man 's scalding anger at a fool world and the fools in it . What a damn hard time it had been to hit the road . You do n't know what it was like , he had told his wives , until they said they did know , he 'd pounded it into their ears two hundred times , the poor youth on the street holding up a sign asking for work , the job with the furnace man , yatata yatata ya . Thirty miles out of Cheyenne he saw the first billboard : WYOMING DOWN UNDER , Western Fun the Other Way , over a blown-up photograph of kangaroos hopping through the sagebrush and a blond child grinning in a manic imitation of pleasure . A diagonal banner warned , Open May 31 . SO what , Rollo had said to the old man 's girlfriend , what about that Mr. Tin Head ? Looking at her , not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her like an iron over a shirt and the old man in his mailman 's sweater and lopsided hat tasting his Everclear and not noticing or not caring , getting up every now and then to lurch onto the porch and water the weeds . When he left the room , the tension ebbed and they were only ordinary people to whom nothing happened . Rollo looked away from the woman , leaned down to scratch the dog 's ears , saying Snarleyow Snapper , and the woman took a dish to the sink and ran water on it , yawning . When the old man came back to his chair , the Everclear like sweet oil in his glass , glances resharpened and inflections of voice again carried complex messages . Well , well , she said , tossing her braids back , every year Tin Head butchers one of his steers , and that 's what they 'd eat all winter long , boiled , fried , smoked , fricasseed , burned , and raw . So one time he 's out there by the barn , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it drops stun down . He ties up the back legs , hoists it up and sticks it , shoves the tub under to catch the blood . When it 's bled out pretty good , he lets it down and starts skinning it , starts with the head , cuts back of the poll down past the eye to the nose , peels the hide back . He do n't cut the head off but keeps on skinning , dewclaws to hock , up the inside of the thigh and then to the cod and down the middle of the belly to brisket . Now he 's ready to start siding , working that tough old skin off . But siding is hard work ( the old man nodded ) and he gets the hide off about halfway and starts thinking about dinner . So he leaves the steer half-skinned there on the ground and he goes into the kitchen , but first he cuts out the tongue , which is his favorite dish all cooked up and eat cold with Mrs. Tin Head 's mustard in a forget-me-not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dinner . Dinner is chicken and dumplins , one of them changed-color chickens started out white and ended up blue , yessir , blue as your old daddy 's eyes . She was a total liar . The old man 's eyes were murk brown . ONTO the high plains sifted the fine snow , delicately clouding the air , a rare dust , beautiful , he thought , silk gauze , but there was muscle in the wind rocking the heavy car , a great pulsing artery of the jet stream swooping down from the sky to touch the earth . Plumes of smoke rose hundreds of feet into the air , elegant fountains and twisting snow devils , shapes of veiled Arab women and ghost riders dissolving in white fume . The snow snakes writhing across the asphalt straightened into rods . He was driving in a rushing river of cold whiteout foam . He could see nothing ; he trod on the brake , the wind buffeting the car , a bitter , hardflung dust hissing over metal and glass . The car shuddered . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road was clear ; he could see a long , empty mile . How do you know when there 's enough of anything ? What trips the lever that snaps up the STOP sign ? What electrical currents fizz and crackle in the brain to shape the decision to quit a place ? He had listened to her damn story and the dice had rolled . For years he believed he had left without hard reason and suffered for it . But he 'd learned from television nature programs that it had been time for him to find his own territory and his own woman . How many women were out there ! He had married three of them and sampled plenty . WITH the lapping subtlety of an incoming tide the shape of the ranch began to gather in his mind ; he could recall sharply the fences he 'd made , taut wire and perfect corners , the draws and rock outcrops , the watercourse valley steepening , cliffs like bones with shreds of meat on them rising and rising , and the stream plunging suddenly underground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the mountain ten miles west on a neighbor 's place but leaving their ranch some badland red country as dry as a cracker , steep canyons with high caves suited to lions . He and Rollo had shot two early in that winter , close to the overhang with the painted vulvas . There were good caves up there from a lion 's point of view . HE traveled against curdled sky . In the last sixty miles the snow began again . He climbed out of Buffalo . Pallid flakes as distant from one another as galaxies flew past , then more , and in ten minutes he was crawling at twenty miles an hour , the windshield wipers thumping like a stick dragged down the stairs . The light was falling out of the day when he reached the pass , the blunt mountains lost in snow , the greasy hairpin turns ahead . He drove slowly and steadily in a low gear ; he had not forgotten how to drive a winter mountain . But the wind was up again , rocking and slapping the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sweating with the anxiety of keeping to the road , dizzy with the altitude . Twelve more miles , sliding and buffeted , before he reached Ten Sleep , where streetlights glowed in revolving circles like Van Gogh 's sun . There had not been electricity when he left the place . In those days there were seventeen black , lightless miles between the town and the ranch , and now the long arch of years compressed into that distance . His headlights picked up a sign : 20 MILES TO WYOMING DOWN UNDER . Emus and bison leered above the letters . He turned onto the snowy road , marked with a single set of tracks , faint but still discernible , the heater fan whirring , the radio silent , all beyond the headlights blurred . Yet everything was as it had been , the shape of the road achingly familiar , sentinel rocks looming as they had in his youth . There was an eerie dream quality in seeing the deserted Farrier place leaning east as it had leaned sixty years ago , and the Banner ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned off , the gate ghostly in the snow but still flying its wrought-iron flag , unmarked by the injuries of weather , and the taut five-strand fences and dim shifting forms of cattle . Next would come the road to their ranch , a left-hand turn just over the crest of a rise . He was running now on the unmarked road through great darkness . WINKING at Rollo , the girlfriend had said , Yes , she had said , Yes , sir , Tin Head eats half his dinner and then he has to take a little nap . After a while he wakes up again and goes outside , stretching his arms and yawning , says , Guess I 'll finish skinning out that steer . But the steer ai n't there . It 's gone . Only the tongue , laying on the ground all covered with dirt and straw , and the tub of blood and the dog licking at it . It was her voice that drew you in , that low , twangy voice , would n't matter if she was saying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could make you smell the smoke from an imagined fire . How could he not recognize the turnoff to the ranch ? It was so clear and sharp in his mind : the dusty crimp of the corner , the low section where the snow drifted , the run where willows slapped the side of the truck . He went a mile , watching for it , but the turn did n't come up ; then he watched for the Bob Kitchen place , two miles beyond , but the distance unrolled and there was nothing . He made a three-point turn and backtracked . Rollo must have given up the old entrance road , for it was n't there . The Kitchen place was gone to fire or wind . If he did n't find the turn , it was no great loss ; back to Ten Sleep and scout a motel . But he hated to quit when he was close enough to spit , hated to retrace black miles on a bad night when he was maybe twenty minutes away from the ranch . He drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance appeared on the right , although the gate was gone and the sign down . That was why he 'd missed it , that and a clump of sagebrush that obscured the gap . He turned in , feeling a little triumph . But the road under the snow was rough and got rougher , until he was bucking along over boulders and slanted rock and knew wherever he was , it was not right . He could n't turn around on the narrow track and began backing gingerly , the window down , craning his stiff neck , staring into the redness cast by the taillights . The car 's right rear tire rolled up over a boulder , slid , and sank into a quaggy hole . The tires spun in the snow , but he got no purchase . I 'll sit here , he said aloud . I 'll sit here until it 's light and then walk down to the Banner place and ask for a cup of coffee . I 'll be cold but I wo n't freeze to death . It played like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banner opening the door and saying , Why , it 's Mero , come on in and have some java and a hot biscuit , before he remembered that Bob Banner would have to be 120 years old to fill that role . He was maybe three miles from Banner 's gate , and the Banner ranch house was another seven miles beyond the gate . Say a ten-mile hike at altitude in a snowstorm . On the other hand , he had half a tank of gas . He could run the car for a while , turn it off , start it again , all through the night . It was bad luck , but that 's all . The trick was patience . He dozed half an hour in the wind-rocked car , woke shivering and cramped . He wanted to lie down . He thought perhaps he could put a flat rock under the Goddamn tire . Never say die , he said , feeling around the passenger-side floor for the flashlight in his emergency bag , and then remembering the wrecked car towed away , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches and candle and power bars and bottle of water still in it , and probably now in the damn tow driver 's damn wife 's car . He might get a good enough look anyway in the snow-reflected light . He put on his gloves and buttoned his coat , got out and locked the car , sidled around to the rear , bent down . The taillights lit the snow beneath the rear of the car like a fresh bloodstain . There was a cradle-sized depression eaten out by the spinning tire . Two or three flat ones might get him out , or small round ones-he was not going to insist on the perfect stone . The wind tore at him ; the snow was certainly drifting up . He began to shuffle on the road , feeling with his feet for rocks he could move , the car 's even throbbing promising motion and escape . The wind was sharp and his ears ached . His wool cap was in the damn emergency bag . MY Lord , she continued , Tin Head is just startled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks somebody , some neighbor , do n't like him , plenty of them , come and stole it . He looks around for tire marks or footprints but he do n't see nothing except old cow tracks . He puts his hand up to his eyes and stares away . Nothing in the north , the south , the east , but way over there in the west , on the side of the mountain , he sees something moving stiff and slow , stumbling along . It looks raw and it 's got something bunchy and wet hanging down over its hindquarters . Yeah , it was the steer , never making no sound . And just then it stops and it looks back . And all that distance Tin Head can see the raw meat of the head and the shoulder muscles and the empty mouth without no tongue open wide and its red eyes glaring at him , pure teetotal hate like arrows coming at him , and he knows he is done for and all of his kids and their kids is done for , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her blue dishes has got to break , and the dog that licked the blood is done for , and the house where they lived has to blow away or burn up and every fly or mouse in it . There was a silence and she added , That 's it . And it all went against him too . That 's it ? Rollo said in a greedy , hot way . YET he knew he was on the ranch , he felt it , and he knew this road , too . It was not the main ranch road but some lower entrance he could not quite recollect that cut in below the river . Now he remembered that the main entrance gate was on a side road that branched off well before the Banner place . He found another good stone , another , wondering which track this could be ; the map of the ranch in his memory was not as bright now , but scuffed and obliterated as though trodden . The remembered gates collapsed , fences wavered , while the badland features swelled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lions snarled , the river corkscrewed through a stone hole at a tremendous rate , and boulders cascaded from the heights . Beyond the barbwire something moved . He grasped the car-door handle . It was locked . Inside , by the dashboard glow , he could see the gleam of the keys in the ignition where he 'd left them to keep the car running . The situation was almost comic . He picked up a big two-hand rock , smashed it on the driver's-side window , and slipped his arm in through the hole , into the delicious warmth of the car , a contortionist 's reach , twisting behind the steering wheel and down , and had he not kept limber with exercise and nut cutlets and green leafy vegetables he could never have reached the keys . His fingers grazed and then grasped , and he had them . This is how they sort out the men from the boys , he said aloud . As his fingers closed on the keys , he glanced at the passenger door . The lock button stood high . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he strained to reach the keys when he had only to lift the lock button on the driver 's side ? Cursing , he pulled out the rubber floor mats and arranged them over the stones , stumbled around the car once more . He was dizzy , tremendously thirsty and hungry , opened his mouth to snowflakes . He had eaten nothing for two days but the burned eggs that morning . He could eat a dozen burned eggs now . The snow roared through the broken window . He put the car in reverse and slowly trod the gas . The car lurched and steadied in the track , and once more he was twisting his neck , backing in the red glare , twenty feet , thirty , but slipping and spinning ; the snow was too deep . He was backing up an incline that had seemed level on the way in but now showed itself as a remorselessly long hill , studded with rocks and deep in snow . His incoming tracks twisted like rope . He forced out another twenty feet , spinning the tires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideways off the track and into a two-foot ditch , the engine died , and that was it . He was almost relieved to have reached this point where the celestial fingernails were poised to nip his thread . He dismissed the ten-mile distance to the Banner place : it might not be that far , or maybe they had pulled the ranch closer to the main road . A truck might come by . Shoes slipping , coat buttoned awry , he might find the mythical Grand Hotel in the sagebrush . ON the main road his tire tracks showed as a faint pattern in the pearly apricot light from the risen moon , winking behind roiling clouds of snow . His blurred shadow strengthened whenever the wind eased . Then the violent country showed itself , the cliffs rearing at the moon , the snow rising off the prairie like steam , the white flank of the ranch slashed with fence cuts , the sagebrush glittering , and along the creek black tangles of willow , bunched like dead hair . Cattle were in the field beside the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialogue balloons . His shoes filled with snow , he walked against the wind , feeling as easy to tear as a man cut from paper . As he walked , he noticed that one from the herd inside the fence was keeping pace with him . He walked more slowly , and the animal lagged . He stopped and turned . It stopped as well , huffing vapor , regarding him , a strip of snow on its back like a linen runner . It tossed its head , and in the howling , wintry light he saw he 'd been wrong again , that the half-skinned steer 's red eye had been watching for him all this time .
