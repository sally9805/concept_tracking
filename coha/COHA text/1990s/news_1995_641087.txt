<p> Just as the approach of the income-tax deadline prompts many people to vow to live closer to the bone , the arrival of spring-like weather induces many to want to live closer to the land . <p> Whether this urge to " go green " is the human equivalent of grass greening after a winter 's dormancy - or merely a reflection of St. Patrick 's Day finery - is unclear . But the impulse seems as predictable as photosynthesis itself . <p> Here , then , is a selective guide to making life on the home front - both indoors and out - more environmentally friendly . <p> Recycle your discards . <p> Many families have gotten accustomed to saving and sorting their kitchen trash so that the raw materials can be remanufactured into new products . But they may not realize that outgrown clothing , cast-off furniture , sporting goods and other household bits also can be recycled through thrift stores , secondhand shops and charities . <p> Similarly , used motor oil - another item that tends to collect in the garage - often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though some charge as much as $ 1 per gallon for the privilege . <p> House paints , varnishes and the like are accepted - as long as they have n't been frozen or dried out - by Banner Manufacturing , 2661 Walnut St. , in Denver . The firm makes 900 colors of paint with recycled contents . <p> Out in the yard , leaves , grass clippings and tree branches - which account for nearly half of summertime additions to landfills - are as readily recyclable as Christmas trees . But while some cities and private contractors in the metro area accept yard waste at central collection points , homeowners are generally encouraged to reuse these organic scraps as mulches or in compost piles . <p> " If you 're going to buy a new lawn mower this summer , get one with a mulching blade that leaves the cut grass behind , " advises Nancy Larson , former director of Colorado Recycles . <p> " This puts nitrogen back into the soil , helps keep moisture in the lawn , and does not cause thatch - which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she adds , it 's possible to retrofit a mulching blade to a conventional mower for about $ 20 . And this can be done during a tuneup , which also benefits the environment by reducing pollution from the mower 's engine . <p> Grass clippings and other vegetable matter - from table scraps to coffee grounds - also can go into a backyard compost bin , available at almost any garden center or hardware store . <p> " You do n't have to use a bin , " Larson notes , " but it looks nicer and makes compost sooner , because everything in it biodegrades more quickly . " <p> Denver will be offering compost bins at a discount of 60 percent to 70 percent off commercial prices during a special sale in May , probably in the South High School parking lots . Some 1,200 were purchased at a similar sale last year . <p> In addition , the city plans to staff a compost demonstration site again this year at Gove Community Gardens , East 14th Avenue and Colorado Boulevard , where specially trained " master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning in May . <p> " The average family can recycle 600 pounds of organic wastes per year with composting , and that 's as much or more than they would collect for a curbside recycling program , " Larson said . <p> Curbside recycling , it 's worth noting , has become even more convenient than it was when introduced locally a few years ago . <p> Most such services now ask homeowners to place their recyclables in just two bins - one for newspapers , the other for glass , plastic , steel and aluminum . Typically , the bins are picked up every other week on the same day as regular trash collection , and at no extra cost . <p> Despite the convenience , fewer than half of the potential participants in voluntary curbside programs usually sign up . <p> In Denver , for example , only about 10,800 out of the eligible 25,700 households have taken advantage of an existing curbside program that 's due to be doubled in scope later this year . <p> In the suburbs , the story is much the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150,000 residential customers throughout the metro area , reports that about 40 percent take advantage of its free collection of recyclables . Browning-Ferris Industries , the area 's second-largest trash hauler , has about the same rate of participation . <p> Complete the cycle <p> Use recycled products . <p> " People love to have curbside collection services , " says Danamarie Schmitt , coordinator of Denver 's recycling program . <p> " But they need to understand that they have a responsibility to complete the cycle by buying consumer products with recycled materials in them . " <p> Beer and pop cans , of course , are now made largely of recycled aluminum , and readers of The Post may know that the paper it 's printed on consists substantially of recycled newsprint . But numerous other paper products - from toilet tissue to greeting cards to fax sheets - are readily available in recycled forms as well . <p> And new recycled goods are hitting the market as well , like carpeting made from plastic pop bottles , padding made from old car tires and floor tiles made from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplier that expects to open an outlet in Denver 's Cherry Creek North in May , offers such carpeting . <p> It 's almost indistinguishable from the traditional kind and comes in an astounding 500 or so different colors . <p> Complete the Cycle , a nonprofit organization that displays some 170 recycled-content products in a showroom at 3600 E. 48th Ave. , just northwest of Interstate 70 and Colorado Boulevard , has lamps , coffee tables and wall units made in Fort Collins from a mixture of wood chips , recycled cardboard and paper . <p> But the fastest-growing segment of the consumer market seems to be plastic lumber , which can be used for everything from fence posts to picnic tables . <p> " Most of the homes in this year 's Parade of Homes had ' redwood ' decking made of recycled plastic , " says Kathy Griswold , co-director of the Complete the Cycle Center . " You never have to sand it , stain it or put preservatives on it , and it lasts for years . " <p> As another example , she cites a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making backyard jungle gyms from plastic lumber - in part because it does n't send splinters into young hands . <p> The ersatz wood , which costs more than pine but less than top-grade redwood , is now retailed at four lumber yards in the Denver area : Adams Lumber Co. , 6720 S. Jordan Road , Arapahoe County , 699-7060 ; Chase Lumber Co. , 2040 S. Colorado Blvd. , Denver , 757-8466 ; BMC West of Boulder , 6400 Arapahoe Road , Boulder , 442-5382 ; and Newman Redwood , 801 W. 57th Ave. , Denver , 295-2830 . And Mary Jarrett , owner of an Aurora-based firm called Amazing Recycled Products , offers garden tools , watering cans , park benches , landscape timbers , wall sheathing and a host of other products all made from recycled plastic . <p> She sees such exterior uses as much more promising than interior applications , largely because of barriers posed by municipal building codes . <p> Guide for residents <p> This hardly means that homeowners ca n't be environmentally responsible in redecorating or remodeling . Indeed , the Governor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Builders Association of Metro Denver , has recently published a 70-page " Guide to the Green Construction of Homes and Subdivisions " that offers numerous tips for ordinary citizens . <p> The guide , available free from the energy conservation office at 620-4292 , suggests , for example , that metal-framed windows be replaced with fiberglass or vinyl versions to reduce heat loss . <p> " You do n't have to do everything all at once , " points out Rick Cowli- <p> shaw , an architect who compiled the guidebook . " You just decide it 's what you want to do . " <p> Be water-wise . <p> Most Coloradans already know that low-flow toilets , shower heads and faucet aerators can substantially cut water use , and reduce the need for reservoirs that flood valleys or dry up streams . <p> " But you 'd be surprised how much you can save just by modifying your behavior , without spending a penny , " says Cris Call , a conservation specialist for the Denver Water Department . <p> Shorter showers <p> Just take shorter showers , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to displace some of the water and keep so much from going down the drain . <p> A plastic juice bottle , filled with water and capped off , will do just fine , she says . <p> It 's also easy to save water while washing the car , just by using an inexpensive hose nozzle that operates with a trigger and shuts off automatically when not in use , " so you 're not having the water run down the driveway while you 're soaping up . " <p> Since outside use accounts for 54 percent of the average home 's total water consumption , it makes sense to minimize the need for sprinkling by planting native , drought-tolerant trees , bushes and ground covers - a practice pioneered in Denver under the name xeriscape . <p> ( Denver Water offers a free packet of information on this subject , available at 628-6343 . ) Most people in Denver , Call notes , apply far more water to their landscaping than necessary . Some experts believe that even the ubiquitous bluegrass can be " educated " to require watering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprinkle either very slowly or in short bursts , so the clay soil that 's typical of the area will have time to absorb the water . <p> Garden more safely . <p> Contrary to what many homeowners may believe , it 's not necessary to go totally organic to be more ecologically responsive in lawn care and gardening . <p> Ruth Hales , a horticulturist and CSU extension agent in Arapahoe County , says homeowners can reduce their use of toxic chemicals by focusing on pruning , mulching and other natural methods of control - all under the rubric of an increasingly accepted technique called integrated pest management . <p> " By manipulating the environment , you can favor plant growth and take away the insect 's life-support system , " Hales said . <p> " For example , there will probably be a problem this spring with spider mites , clover mites and Bank 's grass mites on the south slopes of home lawns , especially in Arapahoe County , Jeffco and Highlands Ranch . You ca n't see them because they 're so small , but they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative to spraying with a chemical , " she said , " would be to go out and sprinkle these areas with water to keep them cool and moist . <p> " If the mites get wet and cold , a lot of them are going to die , and the key is just to keep the population under control until they go through the normal life cycle and disappear . " <p> Slow-release fertilizers <p> Many " green " yard buffs rely on compost or other organic materials to fertilize the vegetable garden . But those who are reluctant to give up chemicals entirely can still help by using only a slow-release form of lawn fertilizer , as opposed to the traditional application of 1 pound of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet . <p> " Research shows that your grass does n't need that much early in the spring , " Hales says . <p> " Maybe all it needs is some iron , which will help it green up without pushing the growth , seeping so deep it pollutes the ground water or running off into the gutter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> ARVADA INCENTIVE <p> Like certain green plants , some " green " ideas sometimes need extra irrigation to take root . <p> Recognizing this , the city of Arvada is offering cash incentives of up to $ 750 to encourage residents to conserve water by planting ground covers instead of laying sod . The program , now in its third year , has attracted about 215 takers - about 25 percent of the buyers of newly constructed homes . <p> " We 're not just being nice guys , " explains Ken Peterson , a water resources analyst for the suburban community of 96,000 . " We 're approaching this from a water supply standpoint . We know how much it costs to obtain raw water . <p> " What we 're trying to determine is how much these people will use compared to residential customers in general , and whether this is a wise way for the city to spend its money . " <p> Homeowners can get rebates of up to $ 300 for buying peat , manure or compost to enrich their topsoil , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which require much less watering than traditional bluegrass lawns . <p> - Jack Cox <p> Here 's the personal toll the average , middle-class American child will take on the environment during his or her lifetime .
