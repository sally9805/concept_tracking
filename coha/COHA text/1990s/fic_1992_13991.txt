( Around him stands-DON PEDRO , a distinguished Spanish gentleman , and ROSARIO , a young novice monk . They listen . ) What do we seek ? Love . What do we find ? Envy , wrath , sloth , gluttony , avarice , pride and lust . " Through the center of the marriage bed runs a river deep and profound . " Peasant folksong . Fortunate are they who find it .

We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until old age , sickness and death force upon us a virtue we could not achieve in life . Furies invade our houses , driving us to maim our children as our mothers and fathers maimed us . We become ashamed of our hopes . We ridicule our dreams . Love becomes lust . ( AMBROSIO sees ROSARIO and stares at him for a moment . ) Bound upon a wheel of need , we despise the world . Life if filth , as we suspected . Evil , violence and suffering everywhere , in deadly random profusion . You might just as well call it the Devil . Who escapes him ? ( Around him stand THE INQUISITOR GENERAL , an Archbishop , with a white collar and hood and with him , DIEGO LUCERO , a friar , in a black robe . They listen . ) I escape . You escape .

( THE INQUISITOR and LUCERO move away . They come face to face with DON PEDRO , who bows to them . Exit INQUISITOR and LUCERO. ) p. 4 DON PEDRO I enjoyed your sermon , Father . AMBROSIO I am glad . DON PEDRO I am a visitor to Cordoba , who admires your eloquence . I believe these ladies wish to speak to you . ( DON PEDRO steps back . ANTONIA rushes past him and speaks to AMBROSIO . ) ANTONIA Do you hear confessions ? ELVIRA Bow ! ( ANTONIA kneels before AMBROSIO . ) ANTONIA Do you ? ELVIRA Forgive her .

ANTONIA Confession , Father . p. 5 AMBROSIO It is heard here every day . ANTONIA Neither you nor my mother understand . As I love my God , I love His Church , and divine theology . It is hard to tolerate the harsh men who lecture me , and will not let me learn . I need the counsel of a gentle and intelligent priest . ( Pause . ) AMBROSIO Wednesdays .

AMBROSIO Let 's look at her now , together . ( AMBROSIO and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us . Light glows on the painting . A beautiful Virgin Mary stares down at them . ) AMBROSIO What beauty in that face . How graceful the turn of the head . What sweetness in her eyes . ROSARIO You said that then . AMBROSIO Someone unknown sent her to me , wrapped in old burlap . I adored her the minute I saw her . ROSARIO You said , that too . And I wondered what you were really thinking . AMBROSIO What did you decide ? ROSARIO " If she came to life what would I do ? " AMBROSIO Such ideas you have . ( They swing around , sitting on the floor , facing each other . ) Still , that is exactly what I was thinking . p. 8 ROSARIO How could you not love a woman that beautiful ? AMBROSIO Rosario .

Confession , before there were booths . Two chairs . AMBROSIO and ANTONIA . They are smiling . ANTONIA My last confessor slept and belched and smelled of garlic . AMBROSIO It is not the business of confessors to be charming . ANTONIA I 'm not sure he could read . AMBROSIO Nor to be learned . ANTONIA What should he do then ? AMBROSIO His duty . ANTONIA And what is that ? AMBROSIO Love . ANTONIA And what is that ? AMBROSIO Love is something  --  by God 's Grace  --  one is . ANTONIA To be near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your confession now . ANTONIA What happens in monasteries ? Tell me ! AMBROSIO What happens in monasteries is prayer . Endless , selfless prayer . ANTONIA For what ? p. 10 AMBROSIO You . Your mother . Criminal , beggar , old man dying , baby being born , the glory of God . A great abbey in prayer  --  ( He makes a fist , then opens it. )  --  is as powerful as the sun . ANTONIA Does that make you happy ? AMBROSIO Not exactly . Happiness is too weak a word . ANTONIA So you are n't happy . AMBROSIO Confession , now . ANTONIA Talk to me first . AMBROSIO Are there no men in your life ? ANTONIA Of course . AMBROSIO Are n't you interested in them ? ANTONIA You think it interesting , waiting to be bought ? To lie down and open my legs ? To get up and wash babies and linen ? When I want to read and read and read . Instead , I must marry , at seventeen , and listen to a stupid husband . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make your confession ? ANTONIA What are you thinking ? AMBROSIO ( Smiling . ) Of you . ANTONIA Oh . p. 11 AMBROSIO What 's the matter ? ANTONIA I 'm crying . Bless me , Father , for I have sinned .

Enter AMBROSIO . ROSARIO rises . ROSARIO Father ? AMBROSIO Rosario . ROSARIO Do you like this garden , too ? AMBROSIO After confessions , it is very refreshing . ROSARIO I make up verses here . AMBROSIO Are you a poet , Rosario ? ROSARIO ( Reciting vigorously . ) I saw mankind with vice encrusted , I saw that Honor 's sword was rusted ! , That few for aught but folly lusted ! , That he was still deceived , who trustedIn love or friend ! ( AMBROSIO , listening , stands next to ROSARIO . ) Let me , Oh Lord ! from life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God I fly ! AMBROSIO ( Smiling . ) Retire ? ROSARIO ( Violently . ) Yes , go ! Be a hermit ! AMBROSIO Rosario , it is one thing to be disgusted by mankind , but another to completely forget it . Could you face total solitude ? p. 13 ROSARIO Could you ? AMBROSIO Never . I could n't live anywhere else . I was put on the doorstep of this monastery , raised by peasants , then sent to school and spent all my life , here . This abbey is your asylum , too , where you are protected from one world but remain in another , a world of good friends . ROSARIO Would to God I 'd never met these good friends ! Or met you ! AMBROSIO Me ? ROSARIO I should live in a sewer ! AMBROSIO Rosario ! ROSARIO I wish I 'd never seen this place ! AMBROSIO Or me ? ROSARIO Yes you ! ! ( Exit ROSARIO , running .

AMBROSIO Rosario , what is the matter with you ? p. 14 ROSARIO What friends do I have ? Cold brothers in a cold monastery ! AMBROSIO I will be your friend . ROSARIO You will be my judge . AMBROSIO I set aside the judge . The monk and the priest . Think of me as your father and your friend . ROSARIO You will hate me ! AMBROSIO Never ! ROSARIO Whatever I tell you , you will tell no one else ? AMBROSIO I promise . ROSARIO By the blood of Jesus Christ ? AMBROSIO By the blood of Jesus Christ . What is this mystery ? ROSARIO Love is love , Father . Man or woman , it is the same ! ( AMBROSIO tries to leave . ROSARIO jumps at him , seizes him . Struggle . ROSARIO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both men stand facing each other , gasping for breath . ) ROSARIO Do not think , Ambrosio , that I would ever steal you from the Church . You were left on the doorstep of this monastery and it must always be your home . God forbid my love should harm you ! AMBROSIO But it would ! p. 15 ROSARIO Never ! I heard you preach . I begged my uncle to bring me here as a novice . I have been so happy , just to be near you . Let us spend our lives together , celibate brothers . When we die , our bodies will lie in the same grave . What could be more innocent than that ? AMBROSIO Impossible . ROSARIO The discipline of this monastery is not perfect . I can see you often . AMBROSIO You would misunderstand my every word . Your feelings would overwhelm everything . ROSARIO Are you sure ? AMBROSIO You will leave this monastery or I will denounce you . ROSARIO You would do that ? AMBROSIO Yes . ( AMBROSIO tries again to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from under his robe . ) ROSARIO No , you wo n't ! ( He puts the blade to AMBROSIO 'S throat . Then to his own . ) You wo n't have to ! ( ROSARIO runs off . AMBROSIO stands shaking . He is stunned , disoriented . He slowly pulls himself together and kneels , his knuckles white in prayer . ) AMBROSIO He waited a year . ( Pause . ) I ca n't stop thinking about him . ( Pause . ) Would he hurt himself ? ( He bows his head and prays . Behind him , very slowly , enter ROSARIO . He watches AMBROSIO . AMBROSIO , sensing him there , stops praying . ) Rosario ? p. 16 ROSARIO Yes ? AMBROSIO You 've come back ? ROSARIO Yes . AMBROSIO Why ? ROSARIO I could not leave you in anger . AMBROSIO Tell me you will not hurt yourself . ROSARIO If you do n't want me to . AMBROSIO Sit . ( ROSARIO sits on the bench next to AMBROSIO . ) I wo n't force you . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my love with you and leave me my immortal soul . ROSARIO That 's cruel . AMBROSIO Do that for me . ROSARIO I have no will but yours . AMBROSIO Otherwise , you will send me to hell . ROSARIO Will I ? AMBROSIO Yes . ROSARIO I will leave the monastery today . AMBROSIO Today ? ROSARIO There is an abbey in Murcia . My uncle , Don Pedro , will find me a place there . AMBROSIO So soon ? ROSARIO If at all . p. 17 AMBROSIO I did not know love was so hard . ROSARIO It 's like death . AMBROSIO Goodbye . ROSARIO Give me something to take with me . AMBROSIO What ? ROSARIO A rose , from that bush . ( AMBROSIO bows , and goes to the rose bush . He reaches in it to break off a rose . He screams and steps back in horror . ) AMBROSIO Ah ! ! ( He hold up one arm . A snake , mimed , hangs from it by its fangs . ) Viper ! ! ( ROSARIO seizes the serpent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from AMBROSIO 'S arm and flings it into the bushes . He forces AMBROSIO to the ground . ) ROSARIO GIVE ME YOUR ARM ! ( ROSARIO slices into AMBROSIO 'S arm with his knife , bites into the wound , fiercely sucks poison and blood from AMBROSIO 'S arm . Lights out . Music. ) @x The Dalfa home . Two high backed Spanish chairs . In them sit ELVIRA and ANTONIA . They are looking at a diamond on a black cloth . ELVIRA It is worth a fortune . ANTONIA Who is he ? ELVIRA Don Pedro Juan de Lastanosa . From Murcia . Wo n't you see him ? ANTONIA No . ELVIRA I ca n't be here forever ! You are seventeen years old . You will be alone . With no money and no position ! Speak to the gentleman . ANTONIA No . ELVIRA He 's here now . ( A light , into which steps DON PEDRO , waiting . ) Behave yourself . ( ELVIRA goes to DON PEDRO . ANTONIA sighs . ELVIRA returns with DON PEDRO . ) Don Pedro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politely . ) ANTONIA Good afternoon . DON PEDRO I am happy to see you again . ( ANTONIA nods coolly . ) It was in the Cathedral of the Capuchins . You were thinking of the monk , not of me . He means a great deal to you . ANTONIA Yes , he does . p. 19 DON PEDRO I am a widower , looking for a wife to give me love and keep me from sin . Such a woman must be strong in her faith . A husband can do many things for a wife , but he ca n't give her faith or save her soul . For that , she must trust her confessor and deliver herself into his care . ANTONIA I agree . DON PEDRO I can think of no one better . ANTONIA Thank you . DON PEDRO Your mother wants you to marry . ANTONIA Yes . DON PEDRO Do you ? ANTONIA No . DON PEDRO Then we 'll say no more about it . A short visit , and I 'll be gone . ANTONIA Thank you . DON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am glad you like Father Ambrosio . DON PEDRO I rejoice that you have him , and he has you . ANTONIA I did not think anyone would ever understand that . DON PEDRO I do . ( Pause . ) ANTONIA If we married , I would be away from Cordoba , from the Monastery of the Capuchins and from Father Ambrosio. p. 20 DON PEDRO I travel , often . I spend a great deal of time here . So would you . But never mind . ( Pause . ) ANTONIA Murcia is by the sea . Do you fish ? DON PEDRO Many ships . And farm . Both . ANTONIA House ? DON PEDRO Four wings , joined , with courtyards . ANTONIA A library ? DON PEDRO Three rooms , floor to ceiling . ANTONIA Books on theology ? DON PEDRO A thousand . ANTONIA Do you read them ? DON PEDRO I did once . But theology is about supernatural beings in other worlds . I am more interested now in human beings on earth . ANTONIA Erasmus ? DON PEDRO In Spanish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church . And Luther . ANTONIA Who ? DON PEDRO A young monk , in Saxony . I like what he 's doing . ANTONIA Practical men ? DON PEDRO Oh , yes . ANTONIA Why ? p. 21 DON PEDRO Mankind has suffered more violence in our century than in all others combined . Agreed ? ANTONIA Agreed . DON PEDRO But we hear less and less about violence and more and more about the devil . Bad theology . Impractical . Heresy is the sin of the day , not violence . Do you think the devil exists ? ANTONIA I have heard that question answered no . DON PEDRO You are wise not to commit yourself . I might be an Inquisitor in disguise . ANTONIA Not if you read Erasmus . ( Pause . ) But is n't the devil responsible for all evil ? DON PEDRO I have heard that question answered no . ANTONIA Ambrosio says he is . Ambrosio says God made the devil so we can choose God instead . DON PEDRO I know he says that . ANTONIA What do you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree . Do you play at theology ? ANTONIA Passionately . DON PEDRO All right . 1 . God is all good and all powerful . Agreed ? ANTONIA Agreed . p. 22 DON PEDRO 2 . God must want a good world in which the devil does not exist . ANTONIA Agreed , and furthermore , God gets what he wants . DON PEDRO That 's 3 . Therefore : ANTONIA It 's a good world . The devil does n't exist . DON PEDRO All right . But 4.  --  4.  --  come now  --  ANTONIA We observe that evil does exist : therefore : DON PEDRO God does not exist , or : ANTONIA God is evil ? DON PEDRO Or God and the Devil were the same thing once and may be again . ANTONIA In which case : DON PEDRO Good will be Evil and Evil will be Good all at once , as once perhaps it was . ANTONIA And the Devil will think he is doing good ? DON PEDRO Yes ! ANTONIA That 's impossible ! DON PEDRO I love the impossible ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love for me , then , an impossibility . p. 23 DON PEDRO " Fools desire the ordinary . The wise have impossible loves . " ( Pause . ANTONIA laughs . ) ANTONIA That 's not theology . You are so peculiar ! Where did you hear that ? DON PEDRO Drinking song . ANTONIA Do you drink ? DON PEDRO Sometimes . ANTONIA Do you get drunk and talk and talk and talk ? DON PEDRO Sometimes . ANTONIA Do you stun women with torrents of verbal brilliance ? DON PEDRO I have been known to do that . ANTONIA And you admit it ! DON PEDRO Do you like to make fools out of men ? ANTONIA Yes . BOTH And you admit it ! ANTONIA Suppose I want an impossible love ? No , maybe two or three ? DON PEDRO No one should suffer from poverty of experience , not even my wife . ANTONIA You take my breath away . DON PEDRO I have brought you a present . Here . ( He hands her a small silver locket . ) Open it . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I collect paintings . Those are miniatures . The Abbey of the Capuchins on one side , and a portrait of its famous monk Ambrosio on the other . The inlays are emerald . I hope you like them . ANTONIA I do ! ( Music. ) @x Music . AMBROSIO 'S cell . In his bed , ROSARIO , sleeping . AMBROSIO kneeling by the bed , praying . Above them the painting of the Virgin Mary . ) AMBROSIO In manas tuas , commendo spiritum meum . Amen . ( ROSARIO opens his eyes , sees AMBROSIO praying . He smiles , then closes his eyes again , and wakes himself up , moaning . ) ROSARIO Where am I ? AMBROSIO In my bed . ROSARIO How can that be ? AMBROSIO You have been unconscious for two days . ROSARIO Where have you slept ? AMBROSIO On the floor of the chapel , praying for you . ROSARIO Oh . AMBROSIO You saved my life . But you swallowed much of the venom . No man poisoned by that viper has ever lived . ROSARIO Oh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long will it be before another monk comes and takes your place ? AMBROSIO As long as you like . ROSARIO What did you think , when I lay dying ? p. 26 AMBROSIO Please . ROSARIO Tell me ! AMBROSIO I understood what love is . I begged the Blessed Virgin to save you . ROSARIO Ah ! AMBROSIO What is it ? ROSARIO The venom ! My blood is on fire ! AMBROSIO Hold my hands ! ROSARIO Ahh ! ! AMBROSIO Rosario ! ! ( Pause . ROSARIO 's spasm relents . He lies back on the bed . ) ROSARIO Ambrosio , look at my face . Closely . Have you never seen this face before ? AMBROSIO I think I have . ROSARIO You loved this face before you ever saw me . AMBROSIO What ? ROSARIO Feel the beating of this heart . Now . ( He puts AMBROSIO 'S hand on his heart . He points to the portrait of the Virgin Mary . The light on her face brightens . ) Your Madonna . Look at her . Go . ( ROSARIO points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Her face is mine . She was painted for me . I sent her to the monastery . You put her in this cell to adore . When you loved the Virgin Mary , you loved me ! ( The light is very bright on the painting . The face of the Madonna is clearly ROSARIO 'S . ) Do you want me to live , Ambrosio ? p. 27 AMBROSIO Yes ! ROSARIO What would you give for me ? AMBROSIO Anything ! ROSARIO Then I know what to do . AMBROSIO Do ? ROSARIO Help me up . ( AMBROSIO helps ROSARIO to stand . They move away as lights go out on them , then on the face of the virgin . Music. ) @x ( The underground burial vaults of the Capuchin Monastery . An open space . Projections on the side walls . A dim light at center . Enter ABROSIO , ROSARIO leaning against him . ) AMBROSIO But where ? There 's nothing down here but vaults and coffins . ROSARIO And the bones of holy men . ( Pointing at the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's robes ! Ugh ! They are nailed there , upright . AMBROSIO Yes . ROSARIO And there , against that wall ! A curve of skulls , with a robed skeleton lying beneath it , clutching a cross . AMBROSIO Yes . ROSARIO And there ! On the ceiling ! Patterns , like flowerbeds , or sewing ! But made of bone ! AMBROSIO Yes . ( A light glows in a doorway at one end of the vault . ) What 's that ? ROSARIO Stay here . Whatever happens , wait for me . AMBROSIO All right . ROSARIO Swear . AMBROSIO I swear . ( ROSARIO goes toward the light . He disappears . ) Where are you ! What are you doing ? ( Pause . ) Rosario ? ( Enter DON PEDRO , quickly , toward AMBROSIO . He seizes him by the front of his cassock. ) p. 29 DON PEDRO Saved , from the serpent 's poison ! AMBROSIO How ? DON PEDRO By me ! AMBROSIO Who are you ? DON PEDRO I am Satan ! ( DON PEDRO throws AMBROSIO to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointing at the walls . ) And now it is you who are in danger ! Look about you , Ambrosio , at the bones of holy men . Dead monks who lived in celibate scorn of life . How hideous their tomb and pathetic their remains ! They did not serve God . They defied him ! For the will of God is pleasure , body and soul . To deny it leads to the desolation you see around you and the death you feel within yourself . A garden of dead monks , grandly posed as if in triumph , their souls singing in heaven . But do you believe that , Ambrosio ? Do you ? I do n't think so . This is not the will of God . I will show you the will of God . ( From where DON PEDRO entered , now comes ROSARIO . He carries his robe on one arm . He is naked . ) Love , body and soul , is the will of God . Refuse it , and you anger God , who created you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I lived with , him , in bliss . We quarreled , as lovers do , and he threw me burning from heaven . Do you love this boy ? AMBROSIO Yes ! DON PEDRO Body and soul ! p. 30 AMBROSIO Body and soul ! DON PEDRO You love God ? AMBROSIO Yes ! DON PEDRO And God wo n't let you have him ? AMBROSIO No ! DON PEDRO Can you give him up ? AMBROSIO No ! DON PEDRO Then take him . AMBROSIO Sin ! DON PEDRO Who told you so ? They did ! Those bones against the wall ! Monks ! Fathers of a Church so proud they leave their corpses posed behind them ! Sin is spurning love , not satisfying it ! Killing the spirit , crucifying the body . Treachery , war , destruction . This is only a beautiful boy , who loves you . Take him . ( AMBROSIO turns away from DON PEDRO . ) AMBROSIO I felt the snake bite me ! ( AMBROSIO punches his arm with two fingers . ) Its fangs went in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) DON PEDRO I cured that , too . Are you afraid you are insane ? AMBROSIO Yes . A madman sees things that are n't there as real as life itself . DON PEDRO That is because insanity , Ambrosio , is the denial of reality . Set yourself above the reality of your body and its desires , and you set yourself above God , who created you . You make God angry and he turns you over to me . ( DON PEDRO brings ROSARIO to AMBROSIO , joining their hands . ) Love , monk , and be silent . ( Exit DON PEDRO. ) p. 31 ROSARIO Come . Great joys are waiting for us . ( AMBROSIO is led into darkness . Music. ) @x ( HOLY OFFICE OF THE INQUISITION . LUCERO and DON PEDRO . ) LUCERO Make your visit short . DON PEDRO I have some doubts about the monk Ambrosio . LUCERO Doubts ? DON PEDRO Since he is the confessor to the woman I hope to marry , I may be over-concerned , but I do not think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you yourself were there , Ambrosio spoke of human violence and human suffering , and he said , " You might as well call it the Devil . " Whose proper name , of course , is Satan . LUCERO So ? DON PEDRO What troubles me is elusive . I see how I could be wrong . LUCERO I am getting impatient with you . DON PEDRO He said , and I quote him precisely , " Violence and suffering everywhere , in deadly random profusion . " Then , " You might as well call in the Devil . " He used the word " it , " you see . LUCERO It ? No , I do not see ! DON PEDRO " It " diminishes Satan , surely ! We read in Tertullian  --  " Against Marconian , " Chapter 2 , verse 10 : " He was born the wisest of all the angels , before being the Devil . " p. 33 LUCERO You read Tertullian ? DON PEDRO Only as a layman . I bring to the clergy what I can not understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't you see , " it " is such a paltry , dismissive word for Satan himself ! Moreover , when Ambrosio said , " you might just as well call , " and then said , " it ! " Well , that 's like a jest or a joke saying there really is n't a devil , just forces or random evils , not him , the Great Satan , Mephistopheles , Lucifer . Am I being foolish ? LUCERO You are being scrupulous about the confessor of the woman who may become your wife . I see that . But why come to me ? DON PEDRO Because all Cordoba knows Deigo Lucero is so fierce in his hatred of the Evil One , that Satan fears him as no other man . LUCERO I see . DON PEDRO Many say our Inquisitor General is confused by his age and burdens , which explains his continual moderation of the duties of the Inquisition . I know that Diego Lucero would look deeper into everything , including this monk . ( Pause . ) I understand I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I also have concerns about a neighbor . LUCERO Heretical concerns ? DON PEDRO If I ignore heresy , I am guilty of it myself . If true , his estate would be confiscated . p. 34 LUCERO Let the Holy Office know how you can be summoned , bring to me any further worries about the monk , and , if you wish , the names of anyone who may fall under your suspicions of heresy . DON PEDRO I am deeply moved by your confidence in me . LUCERO With God . DON PEDRO With God . ( Exit DON PEDRO . Music. )
