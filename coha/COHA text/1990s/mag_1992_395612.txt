Not long ago , a close male friend and I had dinner with my father , 74 . When he entered the restaurant , tall , dark , silver-haired and resplendent in orange shirt , slacks and sneakers , most heads turned to watch him . I watched him , too , trying to see objectively this man who has so intimately influenced my life . What I saw was a distinguished-looking older man , dressed casually but elegantly . His sharp eyes had obviously seen a great deal of life and were wreathed with tiny laugh lines : But more than what I saw , I felt my father 's aura : powerful , seductive , mysterious . It screamed , " I am somebody ! Know me . " Much later that evening , after my father had gone to a disco  --  or to a meeting of his spiritual support group or on a bicycle ride through Central Park after midnight or maybe simply home to bed  --  my friend turned to me , laughing . " When I grow up , I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have grown up with a father whose choices in life have been courageous , peculiar , eclectic , selfish and often impossible to categorize . It has always seemed that just when we , his family , were about to fit in and be like everyone else  --  or at least like the middle-class people we grew up with  --  my father threw us a curve , a wrench in the machinery , knocking us ( and most others who knew him ) for a loop . For example : After years of Sunday-afternoon drives to the suburbs , my father abruptly decided to move downtown to a bigger apartment and invest his money not in a suburban house but in his children 's education . In his 50s , just when he had started to make big money as a dentist , my father closed his practice , went to Switzerland and studied transcendental meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . According to my father , he had ended up in dental school during World War II because it was a way to avoid the draft . The day that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North and headed for New York City . He was escaping from Washington , with its color line , provincialism and painful personal history , to New York , the city of anonymity , where he could create his own persona . My father 's chameleonlike ability to reinvent himself , erasing bad memories and problems , adds to his aura of excitement : What you see may or may not be what you get . But there have been times in my life , usually when my father has been in the early stages of his latest incarnation , when I have been afraid that I might simply disappear from his life , too . Growing up in New York in the 1950 's , the four of us , my older brother and sister , my younger brother and I , led lives of privilege . My father was committed to the belief that exposure to as much as possible was key to creating smart , powerful , influential people who felt comfortable in themselves and with others , and who could navigate any situation . My father made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to museums . In restaurants we did n't simply eat , we learned  --  table manners , how to read a menu , international cuisine and foreign relations . But most of all , we learned that we were entitled to the best . I can still remember my father watching each of us intently after the waiter brought our plates and we began eating our food . " Is your food the way you want it ? " he 'd ask . " If not , send it back . It 's important to have things the way you want them . " For a child , there is something profoundly intimidating about telling an adult that your food is undercooked , overcooked or cold . There is also something exhilarating about it . My father was trying to teach us confidence , how to expect and insist upon the best , to speak up , to have the courage of our convictions not only about food , but about everything else . And his lessons were taught not just in restaurants . My father either sued or threatened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself and his family  --  to obtain an office in a segregated area of New York , an apartment in a building where no Black people lived . Always meticulously groomed , my father was first a charmer , then a fighter . If he could n't obtain what he wanted by using his money , education , seductive aura and sense of entitlement  --  well , that 's what lawyers were for . Because of this interplay of charm , coercion and force , going places with my father was always an adventure . Stopped for speeding on a trip to Indiana , my father went off in the police car , presumably to be booked . He returned several hours later ticketless , having made friends over lunch with the cop . Once we stopped to inspect a hothouse on Martha 's Vineyard and could n't resist tasting the cherry tomatoes . We were duly busted by the irate gardener , but my father turned on the charm , and we left with a bag of tomatoes and an invitation to come back . When my father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We never knew what would happen . We also never knew how long he 'd stay , when we would see him again and if , when we did , he would be tightly coiled and pensive or loose and magnanimous . When I was 15 , I woke up one morning and my father was gone . His clothes were there , as were his books and papers , but he never came back for them  --  or for me . I was caught in the web of my parents ' divorce in the midst of defining myself as a woman . For a long time I was angry . As I got older and became a parent myself , I realized how valuable my father was . I missed him . I was slightly jealous of my daughter , with whom my father has always had a close relationship , and of friends who would see my father in his office , at a party or on the street , and tell me how fantastic he was and say , " Wow . That 's your father ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply having a father in the picture , even if not exactly on the scene , should not be treated casually . In my father , I began to see much of what I wanted in a man : his joy in living , his courage and sense of adventure , his inimitable style , his arrogance , his cool . But I also knew what I did n't want : a man who too often put career before family , who brooded instead of talked , who did not begin to learn how to receive love  --  or give it consistently  --  until his children were grown . My father , too , has changed over the years . He has become more spiritual , although not in the traditional religious sense : My father 's ambitions now focus less on money and more on loving his family , the people around him , but most of all himself " unconditionally , just the way you are , " as he says . My father , nearer the end of his life , is gentler , more forgiving , less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , I am more engaged , passionate , aggressive than he . Both of us are more accepting , of ourselves , each other , everyone else . We are father and daughter , but we are also friends . Now I smile happily when friends and acquaintances rhapsodize about my father . Unlike my friends , I do not aspire to be him . I realize how much of him I already am , and I like it more than not .
