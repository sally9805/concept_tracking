<p> It 's the street of perpetual promise . A neighborhood ever on the rise but never reaching the top . <p> Here in the Lower Haight  --  that corner of the Western Addition whose commercial core is the five-block stretch of Haight Street from Webster to Divisadero  --  the eclectic scene teeters between poverty and affluence , optimism and despair . <p> On Haight near Pierce , Howard Cooper is doing the final touch-up on a two-story Victorian house . The cut glass in the front door sparkles ; the hardwood stairs shine ; and the stately facade beams prosperity in new coats of white and beige . But around the corner , a man in rags is raging into the receiver of a pay phone : " God no , oh , God no , " he screams , his voice echoing down the street . " You 've got to help me , man . " <p> Near the other end of the strip , a brace of Generation X slacker types  --  baseball caps cranked aft  --  are nursing espressos at the sidewalk tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , it 's crack , not caffeine , that is the drug of choice at the hulking projects that squat at the corner of Haight and Buchanan . <p> " Everybody is waiting for it to happen down here , hoping every- thing will jell , " said Sarah Laight , an ex-pat Brit who sells scented soaps , fragrant oils and summer-of- love dresses in her Life boutique . <p> STEPCHILD <p> The neighborhood plays a poor stepchild to the Haight Ashbury district , about seven blocks west . But Peter Dudum is betting that , eventually , the Lower Haight will emerge from the shadow of its famous sibling . <p> " This area is cleaning up and is hungry for an uplifting , " said the 37-year-old shop owner . He 's so certain that he 's relocating his Affordable Essentials shop  --  a linen , bath and kitchen store  --  from its original location at 9th and Irving streets in the Sunset District to the Lower Haight . <p> " Irving Street was just too quiet during the day , " Dudum said . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he complained , they often drove to larger shopping centers such as Stonestown on 19th Avenue . Dudum plans to reposition his establishment as a general store . He says the $ 1.25 to $ 1.50 a square foot monthly rent is not cheap but reasonable . He thinks he can tap into a mixed neighborhood of low- and middle-income African Americans , middle-aged yuppies who have been gentrifying the area for more than a decade and twenty-something types . <p> It 's the young who seem to dominate street life . On a recent warm afternoon , the Lower Haight was flush with youthful gawkers , cafe loungers and latter- day boulevardiers . They are denizens with attitudes , black Army boots , nose rings and hair that often comes in primary colors . Their politics are summed up by six bumper stickers pasted to the front door of a two-story walk-up : Rats Have Rights Too , Keep Abortion Legal , Pro Life My Ass , Food Not Bombs , No War and Meat Stinks . <p> And they help support a surprisingly large commercial district including 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars , nine storefronts whose business mission is unclear , eight service operations including tattoo removal and bookkeeping , seven coffee houses , seven markets , six barbershops and hair salons , four record shops , three art galleries , three laundries , three liquor stores and one drugstore . <p> COUNTER-CULTURE ENCLAVE <p> Many of the businesses have an underground , alternative bent . Others are just bent . <p> Noc Noc defines the bar scene . In its window , two black and white television sets remained tuned to blank stations , creating a post- apocalypse mood . In the dark , cave-like interior , stalactite columns painted in tribal motifs flow from the ceilings into rock slab benches . Tables are constructed from the aluminum skin of an airplane fuselage . It 's the Flintstones on drugs . Enveloped by the smell of clove cigarets , habitues order drinks like Snakebite : half Spaten ale , half Blackthorn hard cider . <p> Down the street , Indenu  --  whose store hours are unposted and , presumably , irregular  --  features flashing strobes , mystic symbols and madras bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says a sign in the window . Herbal tea talks follow meditations led by Ishmael . <p> The Lower Haight has not always been a counter-culture enclave . The Western Addition , of which it is a part , was built during the Silver Rush of the 1870s and 1880s as San Francisco expanded westward , according to Charles Fracchia , president of the San Francisco Historical Society . <p> By the late 1930s , the neighborhood was home to a large Japanese community . But after Executive Order 9066 in 1942 , which interred most people of Japanese ancestry , the Western Addition became home to Southern blacks who migrated to California to work in the war-time shipyards . <p> BLACK BUSINESSES EMERGE <p> Through the late 1940s to the early 1960s , the Lower Haight , which had always been a commercial hub , was known for its jazz clubs . <p> But poverty , drugs and massive redevelopment programs brought an influx of crime to the area by the late-1960s . <p> " This place was once known as the razor , " said Mikal Abdullah , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp edge . Haight Ashbury had its marijuana and psychedelic drugs , down here it was heroin . " <p> Abdullah seems cautiously optimistic about the revival of the Lower Haight , particularly with the emergence of new black-run businesses . <p> One is the 3-month-old Shelter Gallery . It was founded by an artist called Stvnski , whose work ranges from deft pencil-sketch portraits to large format oils that depict colorful but twisted 21st century urban landscapes . His partners , Beth and Andre  --  first names only  --  collaborate on what they call " found object " art . The totem-like pieces are inspired by African and Native American works , but are constructed from the relics of an industrial society : broken glass from a bus stop , an electrical fuse , a winged statuette from a cheap trophy , an automobile timing gear . " It 's the art of the urban nomad , " said Andre . " It 's what you can do if you have nothing but your own creative spirit . " <p> NEW BUSINESSES ON SCENE <p> Others eager to add to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After selling his financial district deli a year-and-a-half ago , Mike Fakhoury and his partners are opening Bean There , a large and airy coffee shop one block off Haight at Steiner and Waller . Standing behind the newly installed granite counter , he confers with a sign painter about the lettering of the menu on the wall . Fakhoury said he 's undaunted by the half-dozen other coffee bars crowding the neighborhood . He 's carving his own special niche : " upscale , but not in-your-face snotty . " <p> Fakhoury and others say the neighborhood will be vastly improved when the city finally tears down the two large housing projects that critics say bring a disproportionate amount of crime to the neighborhood . <p> After eight years of talk , that may become reality next year . <p> Barbara Smith of the San Francisco Housing Authority said the 160-unit housing project at Haight and Buchanan , called Hayes Valley South , is slated for demolition in August or September 1995 and its twin a block away , Hayes Valley North , some time later . <p> URBAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they were built in 1962 . But the apartment blocks facing a large interior courtyard " become anonymous and were easily dominated by criminal activity , " said Smith . <p> At a cost of $ 30 million , the two projects will be torn down and rebuilt into townhouses and flats , mostly for families . <p> " With no courtyards , it will be one less place for drug dealers to hang out , " said Smith . <p> Actually , crime is already down in the neighborhood . " Year to date we 're down 23.2 percent in the area , " said Police Chief Anthony Ribera , citing statistics for major offenses , such as homicide , rape and robbery . Citywide , crime is down 15 percent . <p> But for all the vitality and change in the Lower Haight , there are signs that  --  as a diverse commercial hub  --  the area may be faltering . <p> TROUBLED COMMERCE <p> Five empty storefronts mar the prime one-block stretch between Webster and Fillmore . And turnover is rapid . One location has flipped from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery in scarcely two years . Other businesses are moving out . <p> The most disturbing exit is that of Used Rubber U.S.A. , a Lower Haight landmark that sells purses , belts , hats and other accessories made from recycled inner tubes . The shop has been written up in dozens of publications , from People to the New York Times , does a booming wholesale business and has a sister store in Santa Fe . But it ca n't make it in the Lower Haight . <p> " All the coffee shops are rocking here but the retail stores keep closing , " said co-owner Mandana MacPherson . She steps onto the sidewalk and points out a former bookstore , a furniture shop and a boutique  --  all closed and replaced by coffee houses and bars . <p> Why are eating and drinking places troublesome for retail ? <p> " It 's the audience , " said MacPherson , who 's moving the store to Grant Street . " This place is becoming a coffee and beer hangout for the grunge kids with skateboards . They 've got $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TALKING , NOT SHOPPING <p> That 's a view at least partly confirmed one weeknight at Mad Dog in the Fog , a popular bar across the street . " This neighborhood is about socializing , " said Steve Ryan , beer in hand . " It 's a place to hang out , not shop . " <p> Said one shop owner : " People around here are n't going to be happy until everyone owns their own cafe . " But Victoria Davis , who 's seen it all after 10 years as proprietor of Vickie 's Street Shop Boutique , takes change as it comes . <p> " Yeah , there 's turnover and a lot of little latte houses , " she said . " But it 's getting better down here . It 's growing ; it 's coming up . The neighborhood is becoming a cleaner , saner place . "
