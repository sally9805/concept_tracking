<p> AS Western countries warn of a troublesome military buildup in Iran , politicians here point to a new arms race in the Persian Gulf that they say justifies a reasonable effort to defend themselves . <p> Following two devastating wars in the region - the eight-year Iran-Iraq war initiated by Saddam Hussein 's invasion of Iran and the 1991 Gulf war in which a US-led coalition turned back Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait - Iranians say another threat is posed to them by huge arms sales to Arab Gulf states from the United States , Britain , and France . <p> " All along the ' 80s the international community armed Iraq to the teeth , which led to the invasion of Kuwait , " argues Mohammad Hassan Mohazeb , managing editor of the Tehran morning daily Abrar , which supports the government of President Hashemi Rafsanjani and has run editorials defending Iran 's determination to rebuild its military . " After the 1991 Gulf war most Western leaders pledged to reduce arms sales in a series of sensitive areas of the world , including the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressured the Bush administration to allow huge arms sales to several countries of the Arabian peninsula , " he adds , reflecting a view held by many Iranians , particularly those in power . According to the Arms Control Association ( ACA ) , an independent watchdog agency in Washington , the US has announced $ 32.3 billion in new arms transfers to eight Arab Gulf countries since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 . Rearming after the war <p> In June 1989 , 10 months after Iran and Iraq signed a cease-fire ending eight years of war , Mr. Rafsanjani and former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev signed a document in which Moscow agreed " to cooperate with Iran in order to improve its ability to defend itself . " <p> Since then , Iran has purchased MIG-29 fighter aircraft , T-72 tanks , and , more recently , submarines from Moscow . Western intelligence sources say a North Korean ship carrying Scud C ballistic missiles reached the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas in March 1992 , eluding a US Navy search . China has sold ground-to-sea Silkworm missiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own military industry . At a recent armament show in the United Arab Emirates , the Islamic Republic displayed Iranian-made short-range ground-to-ground , air-to-ground , and anti-tank missiles . <p> Western intelligence sources estimate Iranian military spending at $ 2 billion per year , a figure Iran 's minister of defense , Gen. Akbar Torkan , confirmed in March 1990 in an interview with the Tehran daily Kayhan . <p> But Iranian officials and Western commercial attaches say poor economic conditions , including a currency shortage , may now force Tehran to trim military expenditures . Indeed , Rafsanjani told a press conference in January that Iran 's military spending in the fiscal year starting March 21 , 1993 , would total only $ 850 million . <p> In a show of concern about Iran 's military buildup , the Bush administration launched a diplomatic campaign last November to stop Western nations and others from selling technology to Iran that could be used for military purposes . European Community leaders followed in December with a joint statement expressing " concern " about Iran 's military buildup . <p> Mr. Mohazeb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long list of multimillion-dollar sales of heavy weaponry by the US , France , and Britain to Gulf countries . He claims that according to Iran 's intelligence sources Saudi Arabia spent $ 25 billion in weapons purchases between the end of the Gulf war and last November . In one sale last September , he adds , the Saudi Kingdom bought 72 US-made F-15 jets worth $ 9 billion . <p> No official data is available on US arms sales to the Middle East from 1990 to the present , but according to ACA studies of US weapons transfers during that period , Washington authorized the sale of $ 37 million in arms to Bahrain , $ 2.17 billion to Egypt , $ 2.85 billion to Kuwait , and $ 25.7 billion to Saudi Arabia , among others . <p> " Iran is spending 1.5 percent of its GNP gross national product in defense , " Mohazeb says . " Several of our neighbors spend more than 10 percent of their GNP in military purchases . The amount of the deal struck on Jan. 29 by Saudi Arabia and Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our total defense expenditures for two or three years . " <p> British sources confirmed that Saudi Arabia would pay $ 4.5 billion for the aircraft - more than twice the money Western intelligence sources say Iran spends annually on arms . US increases transfers <p> " The Iranian buildup is troublesome , " says Lee Feinstein , assistant director of research at the ACA , " but it is a drop in the bucket " compared to what other Gulf countries spend on arms . " The best way to handle the Iranian buildup is an agreement among the major arms suppliers . Until now , rather than encouraging restraint by the suppliers , the US has increased arms sales to the region . " <p> Mohazeb urges the Clinton administration to recognize that Iran , as an independent nation , has the right to a military . <p> " Inaccurate information leaked by US and Israeli intelligence sources that by the year 2000 Iran will be capable of producing a long-range missile and nuclear bombs , " he says , " is being perceived by the government here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military strike against Iran before the end of the century . " The West has been concerned that the proposed Chinese sale of nuclear reactors could further an Iranian weapons program . <p> Asked why Iran has spent $ 450 million buying three Russian submarines , Mohazeb answers : " You seem to forget that we 're not only a Persian Gulf power but that we also have a large window on the Indian Ocean . All countries bordering the Indian Ocean have full fledged navies . Why ca n't we have ours ? <p> " Under the imperial regime of the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi the US had convinced the Iranian Ministry of Defense to buy six US-made submarines . The deal was canceled only days before the downfall of the shah , " he says . <p> Western diplomats in Tehran are reluctant to discuss the details of Iran 's military buildup . But a European envoy says that both the US and the European Community have decided to " put the screws on Iran . " ' One link in the chain ' <p> " A diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envoy says . Tehran " should understand that this armament question is only one link of the chain of disputes between Iran and the West . Iran 's self-proclaimed right to rebuild its military ca n't be dealt with separately . <p> " The Iranians must first lift the death sentence against the author of ' The Satanic Verses , ' Salman Rushdie . They should stop torpedoing the peace process between Israel and its Arab neighbors , " the envoy says . " They should improve their human rights record within their own country and severe all links with groups involved in international terrorism . " <p> But Iran denies being involved in international terrorism and any human rights abuses . The government openly opposes talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors . Spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Akbar Khamenei recently upheld the four-year-old death sentence against Mr. Rushdie .
