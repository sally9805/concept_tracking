A mathematician turns to sculpture to convey the beauty of mathematics <p> A wild sphere flings its bronzed arms into the sky . A twisted ring pulls itself free from a slab of white Carrara marble . A glistening , silky-smooth knot writhes across the ground . A metallic eye blinks in harsh sunlight . <p> Each of these creations , realized in stone and bronze by mathematician and sculptor Helaman R.P. Ferguson , represents a concrete expression of a mathematical theorem . Each is an attempt to embody  --  in a form that anyone can see and touch  --  the special sense of beauty that mathematicians experience in their explorations of abstract realms . <p> " Aesthetic pleasures are a major motivation in mathematical research , but we usually do n't bring that out , " Ferguson says . " I am interested in the adventure of affirming pure mathematical thought in unpredictable physical form . " <p> Compelled to communicate mathematical beauty in tangible terms , Ferguson took an extended leave of absence nearly two years ago from Brigham Young University in Provo , Utah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time as he can immersed in his art at his new home and studio near Laurel , Md . Last month , he exhibited 21 of his sculptures in Columbus , Ohio , at a meeting celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Mathematical Association of America . <p> " Mathematics is both an art form and a science , " Ferguson writes in the August-September AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL MONTHLY . " I believe it is feasible to communicate mathematics along aesthetic channels to a general audience . " His article describes in considerable detail how he created two of his best-known mathematical sculptures . <p> Ferguson is not the first to exploit the link between mathematics and art . Aesthetic considerations have long played a role in the development of mathematics , and mathematical ideas continue to inspire the work of both artists and artisans . <p> Mathematicians have a distinctive sense of beauty . They strive not just to construct irrefutable proofs but to present their ideas and results in a clear and compelling fashion , dictated more by a sense of aesthetics than by the needs of logic . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with arranging and assembling the theorems into an elegant , coherent structure . <p> In the words of mathematician and philosopher Bertrand Russell , " Mathematics , rightly viewed , possesses not only truth , but supreme beauty  --  a beauty cold and austere , like that of sculpture , without appeal to any part of our weaker nature , without the trappings of paintings or music , yet sublimely pure , and capable of stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show . " <p> This sense of mathematical beauty remains foreign to most nonmathematicians . Without a well-trained eye , it 's difficult to appreciate the bare-bones beauty of a theorem or an equation . <p> Artists have helped bring some of that beauty out of its cerebral closet . For example , the intriguing drawings of Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher skillfully convey the illusion of infinitely repeating forms and the strange properties of hyperbolic planes . Other artists have dabbled in representations of four-dimensional forms . And a growing number now use the computer as a tool for creating art . <p> Ferguson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He learned to work with stone as a young apprentice to a stonemason , studied painting as an undergraduate and completed several graduate courses in sculpture . <p> Along the way , he also earned a doctorate in mathematics , later teaching the subject at Brigham Young University for more than 17 years and publishing research papers on a number of mathematical topics . To earn a living and support his artistic efforts , Ferguson currently designs new computer-based numerical recipes , or algorithms , for operating machinery and for visualizing scientific data . He 's particularly interested in developing methods for " sculpting " data into forms that are meaningful and useful to researchers trying to cope with the overwhelming amounts of information that a supercomputer can produce . <p> But Ferguson 's real passion is sculpture . He sees his work as a dialogue between abstract thoughts and physical materials . Mathematical ideas guide his hands , which in turn respond to the surprising patterns and flaws that lurk at the heart of a stone slab or emerge from a fiery brew of molten metal . <p> Because mathematical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he prefers to work with materials that survive on geological time scales . His favorite medium is stone , and the huge chunks of imported Carrara marble resting heavily on his front lawn testify to its allure . <p> For some sculptures , he uses traditional techniques and equipment similar to those Michelangelo employed more than four centuries ago . Ferguson 's basic technique is called direct carving . <p> " I begin with raw material such as stone and systematically destroy the parts I do n't want to see or feel , " he says . " It is a subtraction process . " His tools range from hand-held , chisel-tipped pneumatic hammers and special saws to various grinding wheels and polishing disks . <p> " With a stone , you really do n't know what 's in there until you get into it , particularly if it has a lot of grain or texture or different colors , " Ferguson says . " These are all accidental things that you ca n't do anything about but which you can make use of in the process of creating a work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make appropriate use of what you find . " <p> At the same time , Ferguson has a hand in the new world of computer-aided manufacture . He is testing an experimental , computer-guided system that allows him to audition his chosen mathematical form on a computer screen before committing it to stone , and then to make changes in the design as he carves away the stone and responds to its particular character . <p> This unique sculpting system , developed by researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg , Md. , first senses the stone 's location and orientation . Then , supplied with the equations defining the mathematical figure Ferguson wishes to sculpt , the computer displays point by point how much stone the sculptor must yet cut away to attain the desired form . <p> Because the system is interactive , Ferguson can modify the design at any time , and the computer quickly incorporates the new information and changes its instructions accordingly " When carving stone , things occur that you ca n't predict , " he says . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical material . " <p> This kind of technology may prove useful in industrial applications for machining intricate parts or using exotic materials . " The major difference between my sculpture and industrial parts is that superficially an aesthetic object tends to be more complex and interesting than a functional part , " Ferguson says . Thus , solving the difficult problems of creating an aesthetic artifact helps solve the comparatively easier problems of automating the manufacture of a machine part . <p> Ferguson 's dusty basement studio is filled with the results of his dialogues between materials and mathematical theorems  --  sculpted geometrical forms that go by exotic names : Klein bottles , trefoil knots , cross-caps , horned spheres and tori . These figures play important roles in topology  --  the branch of mathematics dealing with the fundamental characteristics of geometric shapes that remain unchanged even when the shape itself is stretched , twisted or otherwise distorted , so long as the transformation does n't involve tearing or breaking . <p> In topology , for example , the surface of a sphere and the surface of a bowl belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to deform a sphere 's surface into a bowl 's surface without tearing it apart . In contrast , the surface of a doughnut , or torus , belongs to a different category because there 's no way to turn a sphere 's surface into a doughnut 's surface without performing surgery of some kind . <p> Ferguson 's sculptures often involve what mathematicians call non-orientable surfaces . The simplest example of such a surface is a Mbius band . This remarkable surface , constructed by gluing together the two ends of a long strip of paper after giving one end a half twist , has only one side and one edge . Both the cross-cap and the Klein bottle offer somewhat more complicated examples of nonorientable surfaces . <p> " Most of my work deals with very fundamental mathematical ideas , " Ferguson says . That often involves questions of category and equality : When are two things really the same ( or equal ) ? When do they belong in different categories ? What do we mean when we use symbols to define something ? <p> But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferguson 's work has a warmth and softness that belies its cold , inorganic origins . The freely flowing lines , subdued details and references to organic forms characteristic of his sculptures bring in a human element , imparting a familiar , tactile quality to esoteric mathematical ideas . <p> " We could just make a model ... , as exactly as physically possible , " Ferguson writes . " When we got done , we would have just that  --  a model . Nothing more , something less . A sculpture can have ... nuance , timbre , mystery , warmth , history , numerous levels of meaning , and many references other than what its humble origins would hope or explain . " <p> Photographs fail to capture many of the elements crucial to appreciating Ferguson 's pieces . The textures and contours of his sculptures invite viewers to touch their surfaces and trace their designs . And only by walking around a piece to see it from different vantage points can a viewer sample its full spectrum of patterns . Each new look brings startling revelations . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His " Torus with Cross-Cap and Vector Field "  --  a 550-pound , gracefully textured and smoothly contoured sculpture in pure white marble  --  stands at the headquarters of the American Mathematical Society in Providence , R.I. A few other pieces grace university campuses . A number of corporations , private collectors and a few of Ferguson 's colleagues have also obtained examples of his work . <p> Ferguson 's sculptures allow nonmathematicians to experience some of the pleasure that mathematicians take in their work and to share in the wonder they feel . " We see our mathematical beauty in the mind , " says mathematician James W. Cannon of Brigham Young University " It is wonderful to have someone show the rest of the world how beautiful it is . " <p> " Mathematics has tended to be largely unknown , partly because few mathematicians seem willing to expend the effort to communicate with less prepared souls than themselves , " Ferguson says . " I have seen people change their feelings about mathematics dramatically while viewing one of my sculptures . " <p> He adds , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Helaman Ferguson 's sculptures exhibit a variety of mathematical forms . From top to bottom : " Wild Sphere , " " Klein Bottle with Cross-Cap and Vector Field , " " ( 3,1 ) Torus " and " ( 1,5 ) Umbilical Torus with Vector Field . " <p> By Ivars Peterson <p> Umbilic torus <p> At first glance , Helaman Ferguson 's " Umbilic Torus NC " looks like an artifact excavated from an ancient Maya , or possibly Chinese , ruin . The sculpture 's burnished edges and inscribed surface seem to carry a cryptic message from bygone days . <p> This textured , twisted bronze ring , which stands about 27 inches high , actually represents a unique blend of the old and new . Its basic form emerged from mathematical formulas involving specific arrays of numbers , or matrices , associated with particular kinds of mathematical expressions known as " homogeneous cubic polynomials in two variables . " Computer graphics allowed Ferguson first to create a variety of images and then to select a pleasing visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced the intricately inscribed surface , and an ancient bronze casting technique rendered the final object . <p> The sculpture displays a number of intriguing mathematical properties . The mathematical term " umbilic " refers to the particular way in which this torus is twisted . Moreover , like a Mbius band , this shape has a single edge . Tracing the ring 's edge carries your finger three times around the ring before returning it to its starting point . The ring 's cross section corresponds to a curve called a hypocycloid , which is the path followed by a point on the circumference of a small circle that in turn is rolling inside the circumference of a larger circle . <p> The surface relief pattern approximates a fractal curve , which winds in and out to cover the whole surface . In fractal curves , large-scale patterns repeat themselves on ever-smaller scales so that a magnified image of a portion of such a curve looks just like the overall curve . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> Whaledream <p> Imagine a sphere with two arms reaching out to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of fingers , and that each of these fingers has a pair of smaller fingers , and so on . Now intertwine the fingers so that one arm appears inextricably linked to the other . The result is a " wild " figure known in mathematical circles as the Alexander horned sphere , named for mathematician J.W. Alexander , who in the 1920s first visualized this strange , topological form . <p> Helaman Ferguson has spent a great deal of time and effort trying to tame this fearsome beast  --  creating several versions of the Alexander horned sphere in both marble and bronze . " Whaledream II , " carved out of white Carrara marble , is one of his more soothing realizations . This large sculpture , weighing about 550 pounds and standing about 15 inches high on a 30-inch base , represents the first 2 3/4 stages in the construction of the horned sphere , extending only to the first set of fingers , which appear clasped in an ethereal handshake . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p>           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
