Dark spots and bright active regions mottle the surface of solarlike stars , giving evidence to their constantly changing magnetic fields . The best known case of stellar activity is the 11-year spot cycle of the sun , but during the last 25 years astronomers have learned that most solarlike stars also generate magnetic fields that vary cyclically . In spite of astrophysics . And to add to the mystery , recent observations show that the magnetic cycles sometimes appear to turn off . The first evidence for magnetic activity cycles in stars came in 1843 when Heinrich Scewabe , a German astronomer , discovered that sunspots vary in number over an 11-year period . Since then , astronomers have found that the spot cycle marks changes in the Sun 's global magnetic field over a 22-year period . As the magnetic fields change polarities form north to south and back to north during the activity cycle , the spots peak in number twice . The polarities of sunspots also follow the 22-year magnetic cycle . However , it is often more convenient to use spot numbers rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when dealing with historical records . Early records of solar activity ( starting around 1610 ) report only spot numbers . We will use the shorter spot cycle to describe the magnetic cycle . The spot cycle is somewhat irregular and mysterious . The cycle lengths are n't exactly 11 years , varying from 7.3 to 17.1 years . Nor are the cycles equal in amplitude . At solar maximum , the time of maximum spot activity , the number of spots varies from a low daily average of 49 spots to a high of over 200 . And as first discovered by Walter Maunder , an English astronomer , and rediscovered in 1976 by Jack Eddy of the High Altitude Observatory , the Sun sometimes enters a prolonged period of low magnetic activity . Early spot records show that the last dramatic episode of low activity started about 1645 and lasted for 70 years . Not only were there few spots but the activity cycle itself seemed absent . This period of inactivity , dubbed the Maunder minimum , indicates that the solar cycle is even less regular than astronomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even further with indirect indicators of spot activity , like radioactive elements in tree rings and glacial ice cores , suggests that the Sun spends about one-third of its time in such Maunder minima . The study of how the Sun generates its magnetic fields started in 1908 at Mount Wilson Observatory when George Ellery Hale established the connection between sunspots and magnetic fields . About 50 years later at Mount Wilson , Harold and Horace Babcock ( father and son ) discovered the much weaker general field of the Sun . Both Hale and the Babcocks used the Zeeman effect to measure the magnetic field . The presence of a magnetic field causes a spectral line to split into several components . The separation of the Zeeman components is an indication of the magnetic strength . Once magnetic fields could be measured directly and not just inferred from the number of spots , astronomers realized that the Sun 's general field varied over a 22-year period . This realization led to the first theory of how surface magnetic fields are created . Because a magnetic field left over from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , some mechanism must continually regenerate the magnetic fields . Researchers call this mechanism a dynamo . Solar dynamo models start with a poloidal field ( like the dipole field of a bar magnet or the Earth 's magnetic field ) . The Sun 's rotation , which is faster at the equator than at the poles , slowly winds the field into a toroidal , or doughnut-shaped , field in the sun 's interior . Convection  --  the rising of warm gas as cooler gas sinks  --  transports some of its magnetic field from the interior to the surface to create spots . As the original poloidal fields dies away , the toroidal field dies away , the toroidal fields regenerate the poloidal fields , but now of opposite polarity . Repeating these steps returns the polar fields to their originality polarity , thus completing the magnetic cycle . While dynamo models predict the general characteristics of the Sun 's activity cycle , they fall short of the mark when it comes to predicting the details of the cycle . For example , one dynamo model predicts that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots migrate from the equator to the poles instead of the other way around as occurs on the Sun . Helioseismology , the study of the Sun 's oscillations to explore its interior , might one day provide some insight into how the convection zone works and thus improve dynamo models . But there is another way to explore how magnetic fields generate and that is by looking at activity cycles on other stars . Studying a larger range of activity will give us more insight into the production and characteristics of magnetic fields than studying the Sun alone ever could . And other stars can provide a glimpse of the past and future history of the Sun 's activity cycle . STELLAR MAGNETISM Unlike the sun , no solarlike stars show Zeeman splitting of lines in the optical portion of their spectra . Only a few of the stars , such as AD Leonis have measurements of Zeeman splitting is larger . The splitting of optical lines in these stars is n't strong enough to produce widely separated Zeeman component , so the spectral line appears slightly broader than normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strength of the magnetic fields not in spots , but in extended plage regions . A plage appears particularly bright in the lines like the red hydrogen-alpha and violet calcium H and K lines . When a star is near the peak of its activity cycle , it has more plage regions . More plage regions means more calcium emission , so the star 's increasing calcium brightness , or flux , tracks the increased activity of the star 's magnetic cycle . Thus calcium flux makes a good proxy for magnetic field measurements . The first calcium-flux study of stellar activity was started in 1966 by Olin Wilson , who used the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory . Wilson observed 91 stars over 11 years ( over 12,000 observations ! ) and found that about one-quarter of the stars showed solarlike activity cycles . Most of the rest of the stars varied also , but not in an apparently repetitive way . Wilson 's survey has continued at the 60-inch telescope at mount Wilson sine 1977 . Although we now have 25 years of data ( including Wilsons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So we hope to continue this program for at least another 25 years to shed light on stars whose cycles have long periods . About 300 main sequence and giant stars are included in the new observing program . The stars range in spectral type from F through K and include stars with ages from roughly one billion to ten billion years . Our observations show that two-thirds of the stars show cyclic behavior , while the remaining stars show erratic or little variability . STELLAR CYCLES The first thing that one notices when looking at stellar calcium flux measurements is that some stars have large average flux . Therefore , we break stars into two groups , active ( strong calcium emission ) and inactive ( weak calcium emission ) . In this system , the Sun is considered an inactive star . The figures on this page show the calcium flux for five stars plotted versus time . ( Figures omitted ) The amount of variability whether a star is active or inactive , only the average level of calcium flux . Because plage regions are slightly brighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in the light of hydrogen and calcium , the visible brightness of a star changes with magnetic activity . Charles Abbott of the Smithsonian Institution first reported such brightness changes for the Sun around the turn of the century , but variations in Earth 's atmosphere made such measurements suspect . However , recent spacecraft confirmed Abbott 's report that the Sun does change in brightness by up to 0.1 percent . At first astronomers thought that a star 's visible brightness should decrease owing to the increased number of dark sunspots . But because of the larger area of the plage regions and their longer lifetime , an increase in the star 's brightness accompanies an increase in stellar magnetic activity . Richard Radick of the Air Force Phillips Laboratory , Wes Lockwood of Lowelll Obser-vatory , and one of us ( SB ) have recently observed such increases in stellar brightness at times higher stellar activity as indicated by increased calcium emission . Young stars , however , show the opposite relation between visible brightness and calcium flux compared with the middle-aged stars described above . These stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently dominate the magnetic field regions of these stars rather than plage . As a star 's calcium flux increases , signaling the presence of a magnetic region , its visible brightness decreases , owing to the large , dark spots . Certainly variations in a star 's brightness are interesting in their own regard . But they also imply that the Sun 's brightness may be highly variable . Solar brightness variations may have a profound effect on Earth 's atmosphere . The small changes in the Sun 's brightness over the 11-year spot cycle are unlikely to cause long-term climate variations are likely . For example , brightness changes of solarlike stars can be as large as 0.5 percent . Such a large change in the Sun 's brightness might account for the temperature variations during the late 1600s . The drop in the mean global temperature of roughly one degree brought harsh winters and ice to the North Sea , leading to the description of this era as the " Little Ice Age . " A better understanding of the solar cycle would improve our ability to predict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a low calcium flux , inactive stars tend to show little flux variation . Astronomers originally believed the low activity indicated that these stars were old , with weakened dynamo mechanisms . Some of our recent observations show that these stars are in a state of Maunder minimum . One such star is HD 3651 , which appears to be caught in the act of entering a Maunder minimum , going form active to inactive ( see the graph on page 45 ) . ( Graph omitted ) The existence of stellar Maunder minima leads to several important conclusions . The level of calcium flux is not a precise indicator of a star 's age . Secondly , the number of stars in flat , Maunder minimum states confirms the idea that middle-aged stars spend about one-third of their time in minimum states . Third , magnetic activity is less during a Maunder minimum state than during a spot cycle minimum . Astronomers first thought that magnetic activity during sunspot minima during Maunder minima is the same because the number of spots is nearly zero during both minima . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during Maunder minima . This lower magnetic activity means that the star 's calcium flux and visible brightness is lower . If the normal brightness variation during the sunspot cycle is about 0.1 percent , then the brightness of the Sun at the time of its last Maunder minimum could have been up to one percent lower than the present Sun , enough to explain the Little Ice Age , according to climate models . Variability in young stars is erratic rather than cyclic as it is in the Sun . These stars may have several short periods that interact with each other to give an erratic appearance to their calcium flux output . Or the presence of strong flares and long-lived active regions may confuse the calcium flux signal . Older stars show cyclic variations with periods ranging from 2.6 years to longer than 25 years . The periods do not depend in any obvious way on the mass , age , magnetic activity level , or rotation period of the star . Nor do any simple combinations of these stellar parameters predict the period . But recently we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characteristics of the star 's dynamo . While more observations and further analysis of this relation are needed , we now have another tool with which to test dynamo theories and explore how magnetic fields are generated in stars . Magnetic activity is n't confined to main sequence stars . Giants in the Hyaded star cluster ( see the graphs on the opposite page ) show calcium flux behavior like that of the main sequence stars . About one-fourth of the giants are in a flat , minimum state and the active giants show a range of periods and activity levels . Astronomers suspected that giants would n't show activity cycles , because these stars evolved from A-type main sequence stars , which lack solarlike magnetic activity . The giants apparently have activity cycles because convection in the interiors of these stars now drives a dynamo . The slow rotation of the stars and the high level of activity permit the exploration of an entirely different set of dynamo characteristics as researchers struggle to learn about magnetic field production . LIFE HISTORY OF A STAR 'S ACTIVITY Stellar observations give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity . The observations hint at what the Sun 's activity was like 3 or 4 billion years ago , and what it may be like 5 billion years from now . AT an age of about one billion years , a star rotates once every 9 days or so . This young star has an average calcium flux level about twice that of the present-day Sun . Its calcium flux is highly variable but the variability probably shifts between erratic behavior during periods of intense magnetic activity  --  like solar flares  --  and a periodic cycle perhaps as short as 2.5 years . When the calcium flux increases , the visible brightness of the star generally decreases by several percent , owing to the appearance of large , dark starspots . Middle-aged stars , about 5 billion years old , behave much like the Sun . The average rotation period is about 27 days and the average calcium flux level is like that of the Sun . The star 's brightness changes in concert with the calcium flux level because bright plage dominates the magnetic regions . During the periodic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time . And the star enters a Maunder minimum of low magnetic activity about one-third of the time . Old stars still behave much like their middle-aged cousins . the rotation periods are slightly slower but the average calcium flux levels remain about the same . The period and amplitude of the activity cycle also stay about the same . And as the star enters the giant phase , the cycle will probably continue . Despite this insight into the behavior of a star 's magnetic cycle across the ages , astronomers still know little about how the fields form . Stellar dynamos remain one of the great mysteries of astrophysics . Although the active active-inactive star dichotomy is now understood , why stars enter states of Maunder minimum is n't clear . And why stellar cycles do n't change more dramatically as stars age and their convection zones evolve remains a puzzle . Perhaps the next 25 years of observing will prove as fruitful as the first 25 as we further explore stellar activity cycles .

THE STANDARDS HAVE ALSO CHANGED AND THE CHANGE HAS REQUIRED NEW SKILLS OF OUR EDUCATORS . TO BE AN EFFECTIVE TEACHER-LIBRARIAN TO THIS DIVERSE COMMUNITY , ONE HAS TO VALUE EACH STUDENT 'S BACKGROUND , DEVELOP CULTURALLY RELEVANT MATERIALS , AND ADAPT INSTRUCTION TO THE STUDENT 'S LEARNING STYLE . IT IS ESPECIALLY SO FOR THE NATIVE AMERICAN CHILD . <p> I began my working life as a library aide at a local public library and as a special education paraprofessional before I went on to become a certified classroom teacher at a middle school for fiver years . In graduate school I was selected as an intern with the Native American Access to Technology Program ( NAATP ) through the University of Arizona and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation . As a sixth year teacher-librarian , working in a Pre-k-Grade 12 school setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the Navajo Indian reservation and a member of the Dine Nation ( Navajo Tribe ) , I have seen the changes taking place . <p> L : DO N'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT NATIVE AMERICANS It is not acceptable to make assumptions about any one tribe since Native American tribes vary . One year , while working at a Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ) school , there was a real need for teachers and close to the middle of one semester , there was still no teacher for the last vacant position . A teacher living in Hawaii had applied for a job through the BIA , so the school board decided to hire him without an in-person interview . After a few weeks , a school custodian picked him up from the airport in a local town located about 70 miles away . Upon his arrival the new teacher told staff members he knew all there was to know about Navajos because he had read all the books written by Tony Hillerman . Unfortunately , the teacher did not last very long because the reality , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author . <p> There are certainly stereotypes of Native Americans that exist because of the media , films , books , or stories written . However , there are so many tribal differences among Native Americans , including differences in values and culture . Native Americans are often asked if they live in teepees and the answer is , " No . " Traditional homes do vary ; for instance , the Navajo home is called a hogan , which is a structure made of logs and covered with dirt . However , Native Americans live very much like mainstream America , in modern homes with modern conveniences , even though there are rural areas that lack basic infrastructure such as running water , electricity , and no landline telephones . Additionally , within tribes there can be language variations . The Navajo language is part of the Athabaskan language ; but , dialects differ between regions within the Navajo Reservation . <p> L : WHERE YOU COME FROM IS IMPORTANT Every student has a unique background and recognizing that goes a long way in helping that student feel valued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , customs , and culture . Therefore , it is important to get to know each child , understanding he or she has individual needs . For instance , the majority of homes on the Reservation have only a few books and there is not much emphasis on reading . Many adults have only a high school education with a few having taken college courses . However , even that fact is changing as more young people are attending colleges and earning their degrees . One has to understand where the child is coming from and where they have been . Get to know the student when you make contact , ask questions to find out where they came from and about their knowledge level . <p> L : LIBRARY USE AND INSTRUCTION What has worked for me has been creating lessons that are culturally relevant . Developing lessons with familiar themes allow students to have positive learning experiences . I begin with lessons that incorporate the family , community , and then mainstream America . Family is very important within Native American cultures and every person identifies themselves by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's clan , father 's clan , and maternal grandfather and paternal grandfathers ' clans . As a result , Navajos never consider themselves alone because they have many clan relatives throughout Navajo Country and around the world . As a teacher-librarian , I use this identification process as part of discussing their developmental relevance as well as cultural relevance . <p> Once the students grasp the concept , I begin to work outward to help them understand themselves , their communities , and the world around them . The students then develop projects based on information from within their communities . Elementary school students could write thank you letters to veterans on Veterans Day . Middle school students could interview living Veterans and write a brief summary about them . High school students could compile more information with researching their topic and interviewing subjects , such as community elders who have seen the changes in their communities over their lifetime . These can then be placed on school web sites with hard copies and digital copies held in the school library to make them accessible for students , teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE INDIVIDUAL I have found that minority students prefer to work in collaborative settings and yet , there are those who prefer to work alone . Native American students are much like any other American child and the majority of them no longer speak their native language . The most important thing is to become familiar with the student , their culture , and their expectations because this will allow both parties in the interchange to understand each other . It is so important to teach the students based on their learning styles , whether auditory , tactile , visual , global , or analytic . Native American students are mostly visual learners ; therefore it is necessary to develop lessons that include visual aids with written instructions in order to help students succeed academically . <p> L : FINALLY In the past it was acceptable to release students into the library to check out books as if on recess , but not so today as teacher-librarians seek to provide real education in the library . Teacher-librarians are developing culturally relevant materials , adapting instruction to student learning styles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from both sides as a result and this learned behavior could be taken into their respective lives . As teacher-librarians we have to set forth these expectations in order to have a global understanding and gain mutual respect . <p> By Cecilia Barber <p> Cecilia Barber earned her Bachelors degree from Fort Lewis College in Durango , Colorado and her Masters degree in Library &; Information Sciences from the University of Arizona , Tucson , AZ .
