The Bosnian Serbs wanted to just say no . They did not intend to accept the U.S-European proposal for partitioning war-torn Bosnia and Herzegovina . At the same time they preferred not to proclaim themselves the main obstacle to peace . So after two days of secret discussions last week , the Serbs ' self- appointed legislature in Pale sent a written reply , coyly sealed in a pink envelope , to the international mediators in Geneva . It turned out to be a no masquerading as a maybe : without giving a straight answer , the Serbs called for " further work " on the proposed map and other issues . <P> The map was the heart of a last-ditch peace effort offered by the so-called contact group of the U.S. , Russia , Britain , France and Germany . Under their rules , hedging was unacceptable , and the two sides were expected to take the plan or leave it . When the proposal was presented to the Muslim-led Bosnian government and the Serb rebels on July 6 , it came with an ultimatum : if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bosnian government signed on without conditions . But the Serbs , who have never met a peace plan they liked , coolly called the bluff . Foreign ministers of the five would-be peacemaker states are to meet in Geneva on July 30 and try again to muster the political will to punish Serb defiance . <P> Not that the Serbs ' rejection was a great surprise , since there was plenty in the plan for everyone to dislike . The Clinton Administration approved a partition that would award the Serbs title to towns they had purged of Muslims with violent " ethnic cleansing "  --  something Washington had said it would never accept . The Bosnian government and its Croat-federation partners thought the 51% of the territory they would receive was too little . They may have said yes only because they expected the Serbs to say no . <P> For their part , the Bosnian Serbs also viewed the 49% share they were allotted as too small ; their troops have already captured 72% of the country . Last week they presented additional demands , including Serbian access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , Sarajevo , an end to economic sanctions against Serbia proper and certain " constitutional arrangements . " The last is a veiled reference to the Bosnian Serbs ' call for recognition as a separate state free to merge one day into a Greater Serbia . For the Bosnian government , on the other hand , a legal unity of the state is essential . <P> In hopes of putting pressure on the Serbs , the contact group had floated hints of the punishment they would inflict on the naysayers . First , they warned , they could tighten economic sanctions on Serbia , the Bosnian Serbs ' backers and suppliers . Second , they might expand and police the security zones around six mostly Muslim areas . Finally , as a last resort , the Bosnian government might be exempted from the international arms embargo that affects all of the former Yugoslavia but hurts the Muslims and Croats most .
