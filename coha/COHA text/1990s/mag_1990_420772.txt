Section : World report Gorbachev and the Baltic states are heading for a showdown <p> Dateline : Vilnius <p> Once Lithuania , Latvia and Estonia were " captive nations , " poignant illustrations of Stalinist aggression and Soviet repression . Now , as an anxious world embraces an embattled Mikhail Gorbachev , the three tiny Baltic States have become inconvenient and unwelcome reminders that Gorbachev has not freed all of Communism 's captives . <p> The Baltics , along with Georgia , are the front lines in an escalating battle between the Soviet President and independence-minded local leaders . Gorbachev has used his expanded executive authority to strike down Baltic laws aimed at asserting self-government . The Balts are ignoring his decrees . Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and other Soviet officials have warned the Balts that they face an economic blockade if they do n't participate in national budget talks and other Soviet business . The Kremlin is stalling on Baltic requests to begin formal negotiations on independence , and as both sides lash out , fears of open , even armed , confrontation are growing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other supplies to Soviet military forces in the republic , Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov fired back a decree permitting troops to use their weapons if threatened and to seize power stations and other installations if supplies are interrupted . " The Army will not allow anyone to mock it , ' warned Yazov . Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis <p> The upper hand . Gorbachev holds most of the cards . Baltic borders , airports and seaports are controlled by KGB border troops . Telephone and other communications run through Moscow and can be cut off at any time . Worsening economic conditions have fueled bickering among political leaders who were closely united in the heady first drive for independence . Other republics have not thrown their weight behind the Baltics ' bid for freedom , and even with Western assistance , the tiny republics may not be able to survive without subsidized shipments of fuel and raw materials from the U.S.S.R. <p> The U.S. and most Western nations do not recognize the 1940 Soviet incorporation of the Baltics , but they are paying little more than lip service to Baltic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington this week , but fearful of offending its new Soviet partner in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere , the administration has labeled Landsbergis 's trip an " unofficial working visit . " " It seems that the common interests of the Soviet Union and the United States are greater than Western interests in supporting democracy , ' says Emanuelis Zingeris , chairman of the Lithuanian parliament 's Foreign Affairs Committee . <p> So far , however , Gorbachev 's tough talk , the other republics ' tepid support and the West 's indifference have not broken the Baltics . The hammer and sickle has virtually disappeared from Vilnius , the Lithuanian capital . The uniforms of the local militia feature new epaulets and cap emblems emblazoned with Lithuania 's traditional symbol , a knight on a rearing horse against a red background . Russian language used to be a mandatory , five-day-a-week subject in schools ; now students choose what language to study . English is the runaway first choice . <p> Travelers crossing Lithuania 's border with neighboring republics now may encounter " customs " checks by black-uniformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tasked to prevent illegal exports of Lithuanian goods , the " black berets " are unarmed . On a recent morning along the M-12 highway from Vilnius to Minsk , they made only cursory checks of car trunks . <p> The Lithuanian National Army may number 15,000 by next spring , according to officials . While a small gesture , it openly defies a Gorbachev ban on non-Soviet military units . The Lithuanians even have formed a Department of National Security to take over the intelligence functions of the Lithuanian KGB , which remains loyal to Moscow . A new Lithuanian constitution is being prepared , and Vilnius hopes to begin printing its own money next year . <p> But the harsh reality is that Lithuania and its neighbors have no real independence , and Gorbachev is fighting back . <p> Last week , he named Boris Pugo , a strait-laced Latvian Communist who helped orchestrate the Russification of Latvia , as Interior Minister , and Boris Gromov , the former Soviet commander in Afghanistan , as Pugo 's deputy . " Boris Pugo is a very , very tough cookie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody who is out there to crush the nationalities . ' With one eye on the Persian Gulf crisis , Landsbergis notes that the Soviet Union occupied the Baltics in 1940 when the world was watching the fall of Paris . But rather than crush the Balts , Georgians and others , some U.S. officials suggest , Pugo may try to divide and conquer them . <p> State of the Union . Gorbachev , who used an economic blockade to force Lithuania to " freeze " its independence declaration , now is trying to ram a new Union treaty down the republics ' throats . The Balts , as well as the Georgians and others , reject it . " We will not join any new Union treaty , ' Estonian Marju Lauristin , a leader in the independence movement , told her cheering colleagues at a December 1 emergency session of the three Baltic parliaments in Vilnius . " We do not belong in this Union , under any circumstances , at any time , period . ' <p> The joint session , hastily called in response to Gorbachev 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including one asking the national parliament to support Baltic independence . Given Gorbachev 's solid grip on power , the plea is likely to fall on deaf ears . <p> The Balts ' pleas for help also are going mostly unanswered in the West . They wearily accept Western arguments that Gorbachev , blemishes and all , is better than a Soviet Union flying apart in civil war or falling under a **32;62;TOOLONG dictatorship . Still , bitterness shows . " It is hard to understand why the world is taking action on behalf of occupied Kuwait , while putting off the Baltic question , ' says Estonian President Arnold Ruutel . " We are occupied , too . The Baltics remain the last injustice of World War II awaiting correction . ' <p> A Baltic drive to enlist support from other Soviet republics also has come up short . Independence groups back them , and some trade deals have been struck with cities and regions . But support from the country 's cornerstone , Russia , has n't been forthcoming . Boris Yeltsin , wary of his own troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence or conclude substantial trade agreements with the states . <p> Thanks to Lithuania 's strong agricultural base and moves to restrict sales of food to residents of the republic , shops in Vilnius have cheese , eggs and meat , commodities long gone from shelves in Moscow . But manufactured goods from other republics are in short supply . At the city 's main department store , the men 's clothing department offers hundreds of empty hangers and in one corner a half-dozen pairs of poorly made pants . <p> Trouble at home . Within the republics , nonnative minorities - especially Russians transplanted during Moscow 's postwar industrialization drive - are increasingly voicing opposition to independence . Outside the joint parliament session in Vilnius , militiamen separated supporters of independence , waving green , red and gold Lithuanian flags and singing national songs , from Russians and others , who waved placards supporting Gorbachev 's Union treaty . Lithuania 's Moscow-backed Communist Party is even making a modest comeback . In May , the party numbered just 35,000 members . Today , membership has topped 40,000 , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outspoken leaders , Vladislav Shved , has just won a seat in the Lithuanian parliament from a largely Russian-speaking district of Vilnius . " Today we need to fight against the collapse of the Soviet Union , ' he argues . " That 's the only way Lithuania can prosper . The West understands that it is not in its interests for the Soviet Union to collapse in chaos . No one needs a nuclearized Balkans in the U.S.S.R. ' <p> So far , the Baltics are sticking together , trying to form a common market to stay afloat until outside help arrives . For the time being , Moscow is avoiding open confrontation . Since a mid-November clash at the main Soviet Army barracks in Vilnius , in which soldiers fired into the air to disperse demonstrators , few soldiers are seen on the streets , lessening chances for confrontation . <p> No matter how long the odds , Landsbergis and the other Baltic leaders insist that they will press on for separation from the Soviet Union . But Gorbachev has shown that he will persevere , too . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct traffic on highway M-12 from Vilnius to the Byelorussian republic ( Robert D. Tonsing-Picture Group for USN &WR); <p> By Jeff Trimble <p> LANDSBERGIS TALKS TOUGH Bloodshed is possibe <p> Before leaving Vilnius to meet with President Bush , Lithuanian leader Vytautas Landsbergis discussed his republic 's drive for independence with U.S. News Moscow Bureau Chief Jeff Trimble . Excerpts of his remarks : <p> This winter will be difficult , and decisive . After all , we now are facing concrete threats from President Gorbachev . <p> We will consider any attempt to enforce Gorbachev 's anti-Baltic decrees an attack by a neighboring country . But it wo n't be like in 1940 , when we were occupied . We have the right to defend ourselves . Armed resistance is possible . Maybe I wo n't wind up shooting the way former Chilean President Salvador Allende did , but I know that in Lithuania there are determined men who are willing to sacrifice their lives in order not to suffer degradation . The percentage of those supporting independence is growing , despite our increasing difficulties . <p> We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It wants either our total capitulation or some drawn-out procedure that leads nowhere but earns propaganda points for Moscow . We 'd like to think Gorbachev is n't actually as menacing as his words , but we do n't know . He is secretive , and his country is secretive , too , and despite all the talk about decentralization , Moscow is trying to concentrate more power than ever in the hands of one man . <p> Moscow and other parts of Russia are receiving emergency foreign aid , and I want to ask Western leaders whether they intend to leave Lithuania without assistance . <p> It does n't frighten us that the Baltic problem is not a top priority in the West . Already , we have survived almost 50 years forgotten by most of the world ... but war in the Persian Gulf would be very dangerous for us , because then no one would notice a little war in the Baltic region ... it would be the most convenient time for the Soviets to intervene . <p> By Jeff Trimble <p>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
