<p> A massive battle is shaping up in the new Congress to write the rules that will allow consumers to shop for electricity the same way they choose among long-distance telephone companies . <p> After decades of deregulation to bring competition to the trucking , air travel and telecommunications industries , " this is the biggest one , " said John A. Anderson , director of a group of chemical companies , automakers and other large industrial users of electricity . At stake is a market worth more than $ 200 billion . <p> An army of lobbyists , including former Capitol Hill lawmakers and staffers , have been hired by the companies and interest groups that want to shape the outcome . " Every lobbyist in town is trying to get a piece of electricity , " a House Commerce Committee staffer said . <p> The issue is whether and how to expand competition into the retail markets  --  potentially creating a choice of prices , packages and suppliers of electricity for homeowners , manufacturers , retailers , school systems , farmers and others . Proponents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's electricity costs by 20 percent to 40 percent . <p> Supporters point to the success over time of similar efforts , including lower air fares and cheaper long-distance phone service because of deregulation in transportation and communications . But skeptics said the chief beneficiaries of electric utility deregulation may be large-scale customers , such as energy i ntensive industries , which will be courted with low prices . <p> Consumers who use less power , including residential users , may see little if any benefit , according to these critics . <p> Investor-owned utilities , companies that market natural gas and electricity , independent power producers , and electricity-consuming corporations all have deeply held beliefs , aligned with their own self-interest , about how and when that should come to pass . <p> House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas J. Bliley Jr . ( R-Va. ) and Rep. Dan Schaefer ( R-Colo. ) , who chairs the subcommittee on energy and power , have made it clear that electric utility restructuring will be one of the Commerce Committee 's top priorities during this Congress . <p> " Originally I envisioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1998 as the year to pass legislation , " Bliley said . But , because of deregulation bills introduced in the last Congress and action by several states to open markets , that schedule has been shortened , he said . <p> Bliley said he expects bipartisan support for opening up the industry . <p> The electric utility industry since the 1930s has been a system of monopolies regulated by the states they serve . <p> Utilities have been protected from competition and guaranteed a rate of return beyond their costs , a rate determined by the regulators . As a result , electricity prices vary by state . <p> Residential customers in the state of Washington , where rates are the lowest , paid an average cost of 5.1 cents per kilowatt hour in the first nine months of 1996 , for example , compared with customers in New York , where electricity is the most expensive , who paid an average of 14.2 cents per kilowatt hour . <p> The system began to change in the 1970s when Congress passed legislation that allowed non-utility companies to produce electricity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1992 Congress went a step further , deregulating the wholesale market for electricity , which allowed utilities and some municipalities to shop for the lowest-cost provider of power . <p> That wholesale competition got underway last year when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued rules requiring companies that own transmission facilities to deliver power from other generators at reasonable , nondiscriminatory rates . That allows a utility company to buy power through a national market and transport it using another company 's transmission lines . <p> Six states have gone further toward opening up retail markets . These changes , and the anticipation of more , already have begun reshaping the industry . Since 1995 18 proposed mergers of utility companies , including some between gas and electric utilities , have been announced . Among them is the proposed merger of Potomac Electric Power Co. and Baltimore Gas &; Electric Co. , which still is awaiting regulatory approval . <p> The consolidation in the industry is designed to position companies to survive the coming shakeout by giving the combined companies a bigger customer base and an advantage when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more generating capacity than it needs  --  about $ 150 billion worth , by some accounts . Companies with expensive or inefficient capacity , including nuclear power plants , may be at a disadvantage with competition , although these companies will try to convince Congress and state regulators they should n't be stuck with the losses from expensive capacity built in good faith and with regulatory approval . In the lexicon of the coming contest , this is known as the debate over " stranded costs . " <p> Electric utilities are divided on restructuring of their industry . The Edison Electric Institute ( EEI ) , which represents investor-owned utilities , has already lost one member , Central Illinois Light Co. , which wants to move more rapidly than the association . The EEI last year assessed its 120 member companies 10 percent of their dues to raise about $ 4 million for the fight . <p> EEI 's senior vice president for finance , regulation and power supply policy , David K. Owens , said the organization is not taking a go-slow approach , as it is often characterized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is an approach that says , ' Let 's deliberate on the right sets of issues , ' " he said . <p> Among the issues that the EEI wants resolved are whether investor-owned utilities will get access to the transmission grids owned by public power providers , such as the Tennessee Valley Authority , and whether legislation that restricts the ability of utility holding companies to operate outside state borders will be repealed . <p> Joining many investor-owned utilities in cautioning against a rush to competition is the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers , which fears that jobs will be lost in the shakeout and that cost competition will hurt wages and benefits . Deregulation may threaten reliability , universal service and environmental improvements , the union said . <p> James L. Dushaw , director of the union 's Utility Department , said the union does n't oppose restructuring and has a good rapport with Schaefer , one of its principal proponents . But he questions whether introducing competition will result in lower prices in the long run . " What we 're really talking about is attracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity has been created by demand , " he said . <p> That means , in Dushaw 's view , that capacity will decrease until people are willing to pay higher prices for electricity . Power failures could be one way to increase this willingness , he said . <p> " If you have brownouts , can you push price with that ? " he said . " Absolutely . " <p> " The people who want delay are mainly those who do n't want it at all , " said Kenneth L. Lay , chairman and chief executive of Enron Corp . Enron , a huge integrated natural gas company that has quickly become the nation 's largest marketer of electric power , is one of the strongest proponents of restructuring . This month it unveiled a new advertising campaign , estimated to cost about $ 25 million , to position itself in the anticipated competition for markets . <p> " We believe the deregulation of the retail electric markets should proceed ahead as soon as possible , " said Lay , who said savings could mount up to 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're talking about potential savings of $ 60 billion to $ 80 billion for the U.S. economy and consumers .
