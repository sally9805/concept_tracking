Julia Levy of Vancouver still remembers the day in the mid-1980s when her heart broke . She was sitting across the dining-room table from Dorothy Coppens , her vibrant 85-year-old mother , who had just been found to be suffering from macular degeneration , an incurable deterioration of the central portion of the retina that is the leading cause of blindness in people 60 and older . " Your face is just a brown smear , " Coppens told her daughter . " I guess I 'll never see your face again . " <P> Like a lot of folks , Levy had never heard of macular degeneration . Unlike most , she was in a position to do something about it . One of the co-founders of a biotech company called QLT PhotoTherapeutics , Levy worked with David Dolphin of the University of British Columbia to develop Visudyne , a drug that uses light rays to combat the severest form of the disease . Although their research could n't help Levy 's mother , who died in 1996 , it has passed muster with a scientific advisory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week the panel recommended that the FDA approve Visudyne as a treatment . If the agency agrees , the drug , which would be marketed by CIBA Vision , could be available in the U.S. early next year . <P> As exciting as the news about Visudyne is , there are some important caveats to bear in mind . The drug is not a cure . At best , it preserves the status quo . It will not restore vision that has already been lost . Nor does it work for everyone . Company officials estimate that only one-quarter to one-half of the 200,000 or so Americans who develop the severest form of macular degeneration each year will benefit . But for them , it could be the window on the world that allows them to maintain their independence . <P> No one knows what causes macular degeneration . In 90% of the cases involving older people , the retina wears thin and abnormal deposits called drusen start to appear . This is the so-called dry form of the disease , in which vision deteriorates slowly , if at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur . <P> The other 10% of cases are the " wet " form , in which abnormal blood vessels spread across the back of the eye , obscuring vision . Former TIME editor-in-chief Henry Grunwald has evoked the wet form 's unrelenting course in his new book Twilight , a piercing reflection on his growing blindness . <P> Visudyne works only on wet macular degeneration , and produces the best results in patients whose retinal abnormalities occur mostly in what is known as the classic pattern . Doctors inject the drug into a vein in the patient 's arm ; from there it quickly spreads through the body . The drug concentrates wherever new blood vessels are being formed . But it does n't start destroying those blood vessels until it is activated by pulses of light from a non-heat-generating laser . Since the light is shone into the eye , only the abnormal growths in the retina are targeted . Patients have to stay out of the sun for 24 to 48 hours after treatment to avoid sunburn . <P> Such innovation does n't come cheap . Treatment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will require more than one course of therapy a year . But when you 're talking about preserving the priceless gift of sight , the expense may seem well worth it . <P> For more on Visudyne , call 800-821-2450 or visit
