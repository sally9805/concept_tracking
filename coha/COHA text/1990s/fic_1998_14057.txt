The play takes place on an empty stage surrounded , if possible , by a cyclorama . Into this space emblematic pieces of furniture are brought for each location . There are no walls and no complete rooms , though there might be a use for a free-standing rolling door . There is no attempt to hide the moving on and moving off of furniture during the monologues that bridge the scenes . Props are mimed except for a select few , central to the narrative . We begin with a chair , a television set , and a bottle of cream soda beside the chair . The rolling door defines the front door . Catherine , a woman in her mid-to-late thirties , is discovered standing , in a freeze , holding the handle of her luggage-cart suitcase . Robert , her husband , a little older , stands several feet away looking at her . Cassidy , eight years old , is jumping rope in front of her parents ' tableau .

( Cassie emphasizes the last line with a double or crossover jump . Then she runs off as the light emphasizes her parents and they break out of their tableau. ) p. 3 ROBERT FERREBY ( After a pause . ) Oh boy . CATHERINE FERREBY Hi . ROBERT FERREBY Hello , Catherine . ( A pause . ) Can I hug you ? CATHERINE FERREBY Not yet , okay ? ROBERT FERREBY ( Nods . ) I am really , really glad . I am really glad . CATHERINE FERREBY Cassie 's great . Wait 'll you see her haircut . ( He smiles and nods . A pause . He walks over and embraces her . She stands with her hands at her sides . Finally she embraces him . They hold each other . They let go . She reaches up and takes him by the ears . ) Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . CATHERINE FERREBY ( Punches him in the chest . ) Do n't be a jerk anymore . ROBERT FERREBY I wo n't . CATHERINE FERREBY ( Warningly . ) I do n't forgive you . ( He nods . ) But I brought you some Switzers licorice . ( He takes it ruefully . ) And your new glasses are okay . ( Awkwardness sets in . ) I want to , uh want to get this stuff put away before , uh , I pick up Cassidy at school . ( She moves past him with the suitcase . He stands for a moment and then speaks to us . She exits. ) p. 4 ROBERT FERREBY What 's forgivable and what 's not and what 's the difference ? I was a jerk . " The quality of mercy is " something , something . I do n't even know if you can earn it ? Maybe it just happens like spontaneous combustion . ( He goes and sits down . The lights change .

Dress those boys up in girls ' clothes , underwear , put lipstick on ' em , you know , have a little harmless fun such as that . Little later on he got picked up parked on a country road havin ' oral sex with a kid and this whole thing , his whole modus operandi , well it came right out . Second offense , matter of fact . Down in New Mexico before that up to his tricks . Did three years , got out , went to movin ' around , lo and behold he 's out there right next door , big as you please . p. 9 ROBERT FERREBY But his offenses were with boys ?

JIMMY RAY BOSUN Meaning , I 'd cut his sorry balls off an ' take him around to schools in a cage . Be real educational , but we live in what they call a civilized society . Do n't they call it that ? So , what you can do , buddy , is get your neighbors goin ' , your local TV goin ' , your Christian churches goin ' , run this guy right on off , ' cause I figure you love your kid , right ?

Robert stands for a moment then looks at the card Jimmy Ray gave him . Lights change . Jimmy Ray moves downstage . Behind him the furniture is changed to a kitchen table and four chairs , representing the Ferrebys ' kitchen . Mr. Bundy , a man in his sixties dressed in gardening clothes , sits drinking coffee . Catherine , Robert 's wife , nicely dressed , sits with him as does their daughter Cassidy . It is a Saturday morning in the fall . They maintain a tableau until the end of Jimmy Ray 's monologue. ) p. 11 JIMMY RAY BOSUN Trouble is people do n't seem to know the difference between talkin ' and doin ' anymore . I got a little land , not enough to amount to nothin ' , keep a few sheep . Guy down the road had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with my sheep , you know , chased ' em around , one of ' em died right there like a heart attack . I told him restrain that dog he 's like some retired accountant . Happens another time , bites a couple sheep . I go down there , told him I told him twice that was all I was goin ' to tell him . Next time I shot the dog dead , walked down there with the dog in my arms , ring the bell , he opens up , I hand him the dog . Just said , " I believe this is your dog . " Dog he 's got now , he restrains that dog . My idea is , you got to know when to stop talkin ' . ( Light fades on Jimmy Ray . We are now in the Ferreby kitchen with Catherine , Cassidy , and Mr. Bundy . ) CATHERINE FERREBY ( To Mr. Bundy . ) Coffee ? More ? MR . BUNDY Fine . CATHERINE FERREBY Did you read today about that man who shot into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Killed three children ? Fifth graders . And then he said he said he had sent them to heaven ?

I can okay , I can watch Cassidy I can we do n't know the guy who brought this . You never saw him before in your life , and we have no idea what his real agenda is ! ROBERT FERREBY Right . CATHERINE FERREBY Can we buy this ? I ca n't buy this . In terms of Cassidy , this is okay , it 's high school boys when was it can you read this date ? This is a mess ROBERT FERREBY But he 's next door p. 31 CATHERINE FERREBY Yes , Mr. Bundy has been next door for two years . Nothing has happened , nobody has complained , he 's been making lawn ornaments . ROBERT FERREBY I think you 're defensive because you let her go over there CATHERINE FERREBY No ROBERT FERREBY You did n't know , we lost our two best babysitters in one month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CATHERINE FERREBY What I thought was ROBERT FERREBY We did n't think . CATHERINE FERREBY I certainly did . ROBERT FERREBY We had no reason to think an hour here , an hour there , hey CATHERINE FERREBY What is your point ? ROBERT FERREBY Catherine , no matter what goes on between us , I have never , for the briefest moment , imagined Cassie was n't your priority . Never , never , never . But there is a guy next door now who has harmed children done them grievous harm , Catherine , we have to satisfy ourselves that no hint of this is in the wind here . CATHERINE FERREBY If I thought p. 32 ROBERT FERREBY Exactly . I do n't think there has been harm , but I am going to watch my daughter 's face while she tells me there has n't . Better still , because I trust you absolutely , you are going to watch and I know you could see a flicker , or the flicker of a flicker . And then we are both going to know that there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down some ground rules and then we can stop . CATHERINE FERREBY ( Lifts documents . ) And open up what , Robert ? ROBERT FERREBY Catherine CATHERINE FERREBY All right , let 's do it . ( He goes . Catherine sits . Mr. Bundy moves down into a solo light while we wait for Robert to return with Cassidy . ) MR . BUNDY ( He holds a lawn sign jigsawed out of plywood in the shape of a locomotive with the word " Ferrebys " on it and the house number " 42 . " ) I do a a locomotive , this one and uh I do kitties , puppies , the kids like those , they tugboats , lions the manes on the lions , they 're uh oh , pretty hard on a jigsaw . I like the lions though . I uh I give guess you 'd call those lawn signs I give ' em to people , I do n't sell ' em . Tell the truth , I do it to have the kids around . I 've lived several places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm doing my lawn signs . You know , makes me makes me feel good . I taught kids . I understand kids well , they uh , they pep you up late in life . ( Wipes eyes with a handkerchief . ) Got a watchacallit tear duct problem . Lot of old folks , they get that . But a but a nice thing about kids , you make a mistake , something like that , with kids , well say , they forget about it . Next day it 's like it never happened whatever it was , all forgiven . Grown-up people , well in my experience that 's not a quality they have . ( A pause . ) So a that 's that 's my lawn signs kids they like ' em real well . Could n't get along without the kids I guess that 's it . ( He exits as Robert re-enters with a sleepy Cassidy in his arms. ) p. 33 ROBERT FERREBY We are very marginally awake . CATHERINE FERREBY Hi , Cassie . CASSIDY FERREBY Hi , Mommy . ROBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , sit with your mom . CASSIDY FERREBY What 's wrong ? CATHERINE FERREBY Nothing 's wrong , sweetheart . CASSIDY FERREBY Is it a tornado ? ROBERT FERREBY No , it 's not a tornado . Do you want some juice ? ( Cassidy shakes her head . ) Fruit loops ? CATHERINE FERREBY Daddy is joking . CASSIDY FERREBY I want to go to sleep . CATHERINE FERREBY Me too . ROBERT FERREBY I have to ask you a couple of questions , honey , just for a minute . CASSIDY FERREBY In the night ? CATHERINE FERREBY You know Daddy . CASSIDY FERREBY Okay , juice . ( Robert goes to get it . ) CATHERINE FERREBY How is your spider bite ? p. 34 CASSIDY FERREBY Itchy . CATHERINE FERREBY You want something on it ? ( Cassidy shakes her head no . ) ROBERT FERREBY ( Returning . ) Juice , honey . CASSIDY FERREBY What questions ? ROBERT FERREBY Quick ones . CASSIDY FERREBY What ones ? ROBERT FERREBY Have you ever hurt yourself at Mr. Bundy 's ? CASSIDY FERREBY ( " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bundy ever hurt you , honey ? CASSIDY FERREBY I hurt myself on the glue gun once . ROBERT FERREBY But he never hurt you ? CASSIDY FERREBY Why would he hurt me ? CATHERINE FERREBY He would n't . CASSIDY FERREBY Can I go back to bed ? CATHERINE FERREBY In one second . ( She looks to Robert . ) ROBERT FERREBY ( To Cassidy . ) Honey , ummm , while you were over there , has umm over with Mr. Bundy was there nothing ever scared you ? p. 35 CATHERINE FERREBY ( Seeing that Cassidy is confused . ) Has he ever touched you anywhere private , honey ? CASSIDY FERREBY You mean down there ? CATHERINE FERREBY Anywhere private ? CASSIDY FERREBY This is stupid . No , he has n't . ROBERT FERREBY Hugging or just physical physical stuff . CATHERINE FERREBY Robert CASSIDY FERREBY ( Squirming out of her mother 's arms . ) This is yucky . It 's dark . ( Robert reaches out for her . ) No . ROBERT FERREBY Come here , sweetie . CASSIDY FERREBY Has he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . You said no . CASSIDY FERREBY That 's so stupid . I want my bed . ( Starts to go . ) ROBERT FERREBY Can I have a hug . CASSIDY FERREBY He did n't . That 's yucky . ( And she 's gone . ) ROBERT FERREBY She may not go over there . p. 36 CATHERINE FERREBY Stop , Robert . Agreed . I 'm going up . CASSIDY FERREBY ( Offstage . ) Mommy ? CATHERINE FERREBY Coming honey . ( She goes . The lights change . The tables and chairs are cleared leaving a bare stage . During the change , Robert speaks . ) ROBERT FERREBY I have n't had a drink in twelve years . Before Catherine . I was a bad drunk , a mean drunk . I woke up once in some motel with a gun , .22 pistol , on the nightstand . No idea where I was or where it came from . I was a was a graphic artist at that time . TV was on religious cable or something Evangelicals shoot , it was Falwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched that for ten hours . Took that in . Long time . Some spirit entered me . Then I ordered pizza and uh called AA , and they came and got me . Since then I have to be careful to assign meaning , to make things important enough to me to stay sober . I have to remember to like my work . I have to remember that I love Catherine . Sometimes things , they still lose meaning . I know I love Cassie though . That 's always clear . I tell some of the drunks that if there 's one thing you 're really clear about , you 'll be okay . Telling them , that makes me remember . ( We 're now in a mall parking lot , maybe there 's a section of yellow parking lines on the floor . Catherine enters with shopping bags . Someone calls to her from offstage . It is Tianna. ) p. 37 TIANNA BOSUN ( Offstage . ) Mrs. Ferreby ? ( Catherine looks , she does n't see anyone . ) Mrs. Ferreby , honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's warm ( Touches her forehead with a handkerchief . ) I 'd have to say this is n't glow , this is plain ol ' sweat . CATHERINE FERREBY It 's warm . TIANNA BOSUN Looks like you shopped up a storm , darlin ' . Oh , I do too . But I got to tell you I 'm in recovery from shoppin ' . I just got to keep my grabby little hands out of the malls by main force ' cause I 'm a shopping fool and no kiddin ' . CATHERINE FERREBY I 'm not sure we 've met . TIANNA BOSUN ' Cause you 'd remember me , huh ? Well I got my own style even I do n't like it sometimes . Well , hi , I 'm Tianna Longest . Like a long man 's tie , Tianna . I think my bad-boy husband Jimbo 's friends with your Robert . I 'm right , it 's Robert ? ( Catherine nods yes . ) I think they 're workin ' on a little project . You want a wet wipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No thank you , I think I 'm all right . TIANNA BOSUN And you 're Cathy , ain'tcha ? Ooooh , pretend I did n't say that . I 'm on a campaign with that word and I 've been doing good since last summer , I have . p. 38 CATHERINE FERREBY Yes , I 'm Catherine . TIANNA BOSUN Well , I know what you are goin ' through on this next door thing , and there is nobody in this world can sympathize like I can . CATHERINE FERREBY I 'm sorry , you said your name was Longest ? TIANNA BOSUN Married name 's Bosun , but I use my own name for my consultin ' business . CATHERINE FERREBY Was there something you wanted to talk to me about or I 'm about to ( Looks at watch. ) pick up my little girl at a birthday party . TIANNA BOSUN You 're kiddin ' , it 's her birthday . CATHERINE FERREBY No , a little friend 's . TIANNA BOSUN That is always so cute ! You slipped out , huh ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my own . CATHERINE FERREBY ( Looks at watch again . ) I might even be a little late . TIANNA BOSUN Well , I could ride along if you wanted of course I do n't know if you 're comin ' back by here ? CATHERINE FERREBY What is it you want ? TIANNA BOSUN Oooh , that 's chilly . Do n't be chilly , darlin ' , do n't do that . p. 39 CATHERINE FERREBY I 'm sorry but TIANNA BOSUN Now , you 're going to think this sounds crazy , but I 'm here to save your life , honey . Make precautions for savin ' it . See , Cathy , you ca n't tell it by lookin ' at me , but there 's somethin ' dead somewhere in here inside here an ' I do n't want you feelin ' what I feel , darlin ' . I do n't want you to feel this . ( Catherine looks at her for a moment and then turns to move to her car . ) My little girl was raped . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he killed her , darlin ' , wrapped her up in a dry cleaner bag , he he was a convicted abuser they let out to live down the road from me . ( Catherine turns back . ) My bad-boy Jimmy Ray an ' me had n't heard from you , we were gettin ' real worried . CATHERINE FERREBY Oh my God . TIANNA BOSUN Oh sweetie , there 's no use sympathizin ' with me . There 's just no use in it . There just is n't any kind of Band-Aid you can put on it you know what I mean . CATHERINE FERREBY When did it happen ? TIANNA BOSUN Pretty near nine years now comin ' up . CATHERINE FERREBY I 'm so sorry . TIANNA BOSUN An ' he 's still there on death row . Yeah , still goin ' on . He 's workin ' on some advanced correspondence degree from the University of California but Jimmy Ray an ' me we think we 'll get him executed pretty soon now . p. 40 CATHERINE FERREBY What was her name ? TIANNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name I 'm gon na cry all over this parking lot an ' ruin my real nice makeup . CATHERINE FERREBY I did n't mean TIANNA BOSUN Do n't you worry . We got to go on come what may . Now the thing is we got to put our pretty heads together on your little problem , do n't we now ? CATHERINE FERREBY You 're talking about Mr. Bundy ? TIANNA BOSUN Mr. Bundy , uh-huh , I sure am . CATHERINE FERREBY Well it 's it 's taken care of really . TIANNA BOSUN Well , how is that ? CATHERINE FERREBY Cassidy 's not spending time there anymore . We took that step . TIANNA BOSUN ( Encouraging . ) Well that 's so good ! Good for you ! CATHERINE FERREBY Robert felt TIANNA BOSUN That 's a real good start , but we were wonderin ' if you 'd got the neighbors together , anything like that ? CATHERINE FERREBY Mrs. Bosun , we did n't think it was necessary to p. 41 TIANNA BOSUN Tianna . CATHERINE FERREBY Tianna Mr. Bundy 's transgression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago . Years ago . And they were n't violent they were sex crimes but there seems to have been no repetition TIANNA BOSUN Uh-huh . CATHERINE FERREBY And his interest never seems to have been little girls . I believe teenaged boys were involved . TIANNA BOSUN Oh , you never know but , am I wrong , does n't the neighbor on the other side of Mr. Bundy have a teenage boy ? Am I mixed up ? CATHERINE FERREBY Well TIANNA BOSUN Then there 's those two twin boys further down , the Kellerman boys , I believe they 're in seventh grade and , of course , that boy won State High School Golf , but that must be , oh , two blocks or so , I guess . CATHERINE FERREBY How do you know that ? TIANNA BOSUN Oh , darlin ' , we got to be real thorough we take up this burden . CATHERINE FERREBY Then why come to us ? TIANNA BOSUN Well it would be safest to start next door we thought see , directly concerned . p. 42 CATHERINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tianna , he 's in his sixties and he apparently , from your materials , has been , you know , completely straight arrow since his prison term thirteen years ago . TIANNA BOSUN Honey , you 're talkin ' all about him an ' just nothin ' about your little girl . CATHERINE FERREBY You know that is , uh , we do n't really know each other , certainly not well enough to make judgments or uh , or accusations TIANNA BOSUN Oh , now , you got me all CATHERINE FERREBY I love her , Mrs. Bosun . I love her and I want her safe , but when she is safe I want her to learn people can change , people can make mistakes , and people can be forgiven . TIANNA BOSUN Uh-huh . Well , there 's just so many views on a thing like this . An ' I bet your feelin ' , like mine , is where many are affected , all should have a voice . You know , a democratic kind of thing . ' Course too , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of places Mr. Bundy could go to . Move along if he felt like it . CATHERINE FERREBY Move along ? TIANNA BOSUN Just move , honey . CATHERINE FERREBY Whether or not he 's dangerous ? p. 43 TIANNA BOSUN Well , why would he want to be where he 's not wanted ? CATHERINE FERREBY Who has said that ? TIANNA BOSUN Nobody 's had the opportunity , darlin ' . Plus I believe he 's well , gone to movin ' around in the past . CATHERINE FERREBY Look , Tianna , I am or I was a , you know , child psychologist , and , uh , there was a young boy , my client , and uh , it was uh clear he should n't be released back to his parents ' " care , " and so representing the State I fought that hard in court , and the parents , the parents sometimes this boy had to be restrained claimed I had , struck the boy during our sessions and I had not had not and this , uh , went on for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my favor . So I am sensitized to these charges . TIANNA BOSUN But , see , honey , you did n't hit the boy . CATHERINE FERREBY I did not hit him , no . TIANNA BOSUN Darlin ' , I do n't believe you did . But it brings up the point that people get concerned , rightfully concerned , I can tell you that . With my little girl , I have asked a thousand times down on my knees why somebody did n't let me know there was danger , darlin ' . And I 've come to believe that is not a question for my Lord , it 's a plain ol ' question for my local police . Now the lady on the other side , Mrs. McGuigan , Jimmy Ray let her know and I would call her concerned . p. 44 CATHERINE FERREBY Other people know ? I think that is Tianna , I ca n't even begin to imagine what you have suffered and are suffering . I think you are an amazing person . I could never be so strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are take the time to devote yourself to this cause well , I see many admirable things in that but , and please do n't take this as any lack of respect , but I think Robert and I can handle this speak to Mrs. McGuigan privately be on the lookout for any anything . I guess what I 'm trying to say is that this is , we feel , a neighborhood matter to be handled by people in the neighborhood . TIANNA BOSUN Lucy . That was her name . CATHERINE FERREBY Your daughter ? TIANNA BOSUN From " Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds . " You remember that ? ( Catherine nods . ) She was I miss her every day of my life . I miss her right this minute . An ' my belief , darlin ' , is that the " neighborhood " is all the little girls and boys all of them so I help out there in that neighborhood . I promised my Lucy I 'd do that . ( Dabs at her eyes . ) Cry me a river ! Lordy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm surprised I still got ' em . My , oh my . ( Pulls together . ) My own fault . So Cathy darlin ' , your sweet little girl she 's probably the last one left at that party , an ' you can blame it on me. p. 45 CATHERINE FERREBY ( Looking at her watch . ) I completely lost track . TIANNA BOSUN Honey , she 's just eatin ' too much cake . CATHERINE FERREBY I should I can call on the cell phone . TIANNA BOSUN Well , good then listen , Jimmy Ray an ' me , we 'd like to come down Wednesday , nothin ' formal , nothin ' big , meet with you two and Mrs. McGuigan , she 's real nice , try to get all this ironed out so we can get out of your business . CATHERINE FERREBY I do n't even understand why we 're part of your equation . If you 're bound and determined to do this , why do n't you and your husband go ahead and do it ? TIANNA BOSUN Honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . An ' Jimmy Ray , he says he 's a bad one to do it ' cause he 's just way too angry , poor man , an ' he knows , an ' he 'll say this is n't an act of revenge , darlin ' , it 's a precaution people have to take for their children . All I 'm askin ' is would you be kind enough to let me have my say on Lucy 's behalf . Just an hour of your time , that 's all I 'm askin ' . CATHERINE FERREBY Well I TIANNA BOSUN Five thirty be real good for Jimmy Ray an ' that darned truck , which might as well be his wife if you want to know the truth . p. 46 CATHERINE FERREBY I suppose we could try . TIANNA BOSUN Well , you try real hard , you cute thing , ' cause we 're gon na be here with bells on , an ' it 's real close to a nine-hour drive with my motion sickness . Lord have mercy ! Now you trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey . There 's not too much in this life I know , but I know that . I 'm going to bring you down some of my coconut cream pie if you 'll just stick a pot of coffee on , maybe even squeeze in some girl talk . You just stick with Tianna on this one , honey . You wo n't be sorry . ( The lights fade . ) ( Mrs. McGuigan speaks first from audience , then steps into a special as the scene is changed into the Ferrebys ' living room , represented by a sofa , a coffee table and two chairs . ) MRS . MCGUIGAN The country 's gone to hell , and it 's the parents ' fault . Plainly put , I do n't know where the common sense is . You do n't have to let the kids see those movies : bang , bang , bang , crash , crash , crash , sex , sex , sex . Hollywood does n't have a gun to your head . You do n't have to buy them cars at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at fourteen , you do n't have to let them smoke and drink and come home at one A.M. And most of all you do not have to blame every darn thing but yourselves as if it 's the teachers ' fault or television 's fault or the liberals ' fault or the government 's fault . You 're like a bunch of second graders it 's Jimmy 's fault , it 's Letitia 's fault , it 's Wally 's fault , it 's anybody 's fault but my fault ! What in the world is going on here ? You pull up your socks , mister ! You raise those kids like you know is right . Do n't take any baloney from them , be up when they get home at night , insist they treat other people with respect or get their butts whipped or their cars taken , and they wo n't have to say " no " to drugs . These parents are just too self-centered to do what they should . It 's not a popularity contest or a part-time job or the babysitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is n't exactly brain surgery , you know , just do it . And if the parents did the job we would n't need all these social services or Christian kooks getting into our business selling us their righty , lefty values and two-bit armageddons . Do n't you go blaming anything else . Your kid is your damned fault , and that 's flat ! ( She moves into the Ferrebys ' living room and sits on the sofa with the Bosuns . Robert and Catherine are in the chairs. ) p. 47 ROBERT FERREBY You 've been very quiet , Mrs. McGuigan . MRS . MCGUIGAN When it 's time to make noise , I 'll make noise . TIANNA BOSUN We just want you to speak up an ' give us what-for if you want . MRS . MCGUIGAN My opinion is I do n't like the idea of the man , but I ca n't say I dislike him in person . JIMMY RAY BOSUN There is a real clear law in this state says he has to register with the police within fourteen days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility to notify those in proximity of his criminal record immediately and with dispatch . Now these officers have just been bumbledickin ' around . TIANNA BOSUN Pardon his French . CATHERINE FERREBY What about his right to privacy ? JIMMY RAY BOSUN He does n't have a right to privacy . CATHERINE FERREBY Legally ? JIMMY RAY BOSUN Legally , he has no right to privacy . He wanted his privacy he should have kept his hands off those kids . CATHERINE FERREBY What happened to those kids ? JIMMY RAY BOSUN Okay , we do n't have that follow-up . p. 48 CATHERINE FERREBY And we do n't know if he has registered with the police ? JIMMY RAY BOSUN That is one-hundred-percent correct . Now I 've had considerable experience on this thing real considerable , thirty , forty of these creeps cross this country an ' I tell you , Missus , the point is not has he registered , the point is putting organized community pressure on the police department to inform the neighborhood of his presence because once that neighborhood gets goin ' he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yellow streak all the way to the Mexico border . CATHERINE FERREBY For what ? ROBERT FERREBY Catherine JIMMY RAY BOSUN For what ? TIANNA BOSUN Now Jimmy Ray CATHERINE FERREBY I thought you paid for the crime when you served the time . I thought that was the social contract . ROBERT FERREBY This particular crime JIMMY RAY BOSUN ( Riding over . ) See , there 's a real high percent CATHERINE FERREBY Yes , exactly JIMMY RAY BOSUN Real high . p. 49 CATHERINE FERREBY During the first five years JIMMY RAY BOSUN Ma'am CATHERINE FERREBY No , it 's my profession . High recidivism early JIMMY RAY BOSUN What it is CATHERINE FERREBY But after all these years JIMMY RAY BOSUN We do n't know CATHERINE FERREBY Let me finish please JIMMY RAY BOSUN This boy has several years where we do n't know CATHERINE FERREBY Let me finish ! TIANNA BOSUN Honey , you go right ahead now . CATHERINE FERREBY This is thirteen years after his release with no repetition and the statistic is less than a two-percent chance of another sex crime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty years old and uses a cane . We ca n't afford to generalize here . You have to take it case by case . Mr. Bundy did what he did JIMMY RAY BOSUN Let 's call it by its name CATHERINE FERREBY in 1985 . JIMMY RAY BOSUN Sexually forced children p. 50 CATHERINE FERREBY Thirteen years ago JIMMY RAY BOSUN To sexually service him CATHERINE FERREBY And it 's time he was forgiven . JIMMY RAY BOSUN and that man was a teacher . CATHERINE FERREBY Yes JIMMY RAY BOSUN A teacher . He did n't just meet those boys in an alley somewhere , he took advantage of his position in a classroom to turn them homosexual . ROBERT FERREBY Now wait a minute CATHERINE FERREBY That is patently absurd . JIMMY RAY BOSUN Because I investigated that ROBERT FERREBY Ridiculous . JIMMY RAY BOSUN up , down and sideways and those boys had no homosexual activity up to that point . TIANNA BOSUN Jimmy Ray talked to everybody ROBERT FERREBY That much is mythology , Mr. Bosun JIMMY RAY BOSUN What 's that , buddy ? CATHERINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey . CATHERINE FERREBY is so absurd that I ca n't ROBERT FERREBY Wait . CATHERINE FERREBY listen to this . ROBERT FERREBY ( To Jimmy Ray . ) Homosexuality does not work that way . You do n't turn somebody to it JIMMY RAY BOSUN Was a case on the Internet ( Catherine has to leave her seat in frustration . ) ROBERT FERREBY Excuse me JIMMY RAY BOSUN Heck , you probably ROBERT FERREBY Just let me JIMMY RAY BOSUN This other teacher , see ROBERT FERREBY Can somebody else talk here ? You say the boy was in drag he gave them dresses ? Well , the hemline did n't turn them homosexual . For God 's sake , if we 've learned anything , we 've learned it is n't environmental . JIMMY RAY BOSUN You keep the Lord 's name TIANNA BOSUN ( Stopping Jimmy Ray and addressing Robert . ) Darlin ' , you 're not blaming the boys , are you ? p. 52 CATHERINE FERREBY Thirteen years ago ROBERT FERREBY I am certainly not blaming TIANNA BOSUN See , he 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm not sure this whole thing TIANNA BOSUN These are good folks , they know who the victims are ROBERT FERREBY Yes , as a matter of fact TIANNA BOSUN No sir , he 's not puttin ' it on the victims ! ROBERT FERREBY Oh brother . JIMMY RAY BOSUN I got some business to do here , Tianna . CATHERINE FERREBY I 'm not saying it 's right , but he paid for that . I 'm saying it 's over . He did what he did TIANNA BOSUN What 's over , darlin ' ? ROBERT FERREBY I think we should JIMMY RAY BOSUN It is not over ! I 'm gon na tell you one time it 's not over . You see my wife over there ? TIANNA BOSUN Now do n't , Jimbo JIMMY RAY BOSUN Last night I wake up , she 's out of the bed , down curled up on the kitchen floor cryin ' p. 53 TIANNA BOSUN Shoot , darn it JIMMY RAY BOSUN Had some half-done colorin ' book she found of our little girl 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This man is a good husband JIMMY RAY BOSUN So do n't sit here in your fancy house TIANNA BOSUN Now , Jimmy Ray JIMMY RAY BOSUN With your import rugs CATHERINE FERREBY That is not the point TIANNA BOSUN You got to JIMMY RAY BOSUN An ' tell me what 's over ! TIANNA BOSUN shut up now . JIMMY RAY BOSUN ( Moving away . ) Heck with you . TIANNA BOSUN ( She gives a little laugh . ) Goodness me , did I say that ? You 're all gon na think I 'm a witchy woman , which I 'm not . Now I think we 're havin ' a real good discussion real heartfelt gettin ' all points of view ' cept Helen here is held back . You got to put your ideas forth , darlin ' . I bet you got some strong ideas . p. 54 ROBERT FERREBY It 's getting a little late here . TIANNA BOSUN Now you hold on , you bad boy . Come on , Helen , I got these bulls in a corner momentarily . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . TIANNA BOSUN See , that 's a white lie . MRS . MCGUIGAN Mr. Bundy has been very nice to me . A good neighbor dayin , day-out . Helped me replace a very heavy garage door . I 'm the boy 's grandmother , you know , and a single person , his father and mother well , we wo n't go into that . Mr. Bundy , well he 's always ready to help out , fix things , always brings over his tomatoes , pies he makes . This other thing my grandson Allen , I 'm raising him , he 's in his senior year always lifting weights plays all sports . Too many for his grades if you ask me . I do n't believe anybody is going to turn him anywhere if that 's the conversation here . On the other hand , I believe once you 've done these things well I 'm not at all sure it 's something a neighborhood can take in , it 's just too this may not be a Christian point of view it 's just too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody knows well , it wo n't be too logical . I like the atmosphere so much the way it 's been . Some people say it 's not real life it 's so nice here . I 'd have to say I do n't mind a bit doing without real life when I come home . I feel I 've been through a lot . I need the quiet . Maybe Mr. Bundy should move on . I 'm not sure . p. 55 TIANNA BOSUN See that 's such a good point . You put that so well , you really did . Is n't that a good contribution , Jimmy Ray ? Now this man Mr. Bundy , despite the fact he has this mark of Cain , he 's been making a real effort from what you say JIMMY RAY BOSUN Tianna TIANNA BOSUN Well , all those years now like Cathy says . He could just make his own decision to move on , not go through this whole thing getting sour as Helen points out CATHERINE FERREBY It does n't have to get sour TIANNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private , honey . I would be glad to take that on as my part . They say a little sugar makes the medicine go down . I believe he might move right on as a neighborly thing , and nobody would have to be the wiser . CATHERINE FERREBY I doubt he has a place to go . If he did TIANNA BOSUN Now , I believe CATHERINE FERREBY ( Riding over. ) he would be there . TIANNA BOSUN Well , honey CATHERINE FERREBY He 's been living next door to us for two years . He has never bothered your grandson , has he ? p. 56 MRS . MCGUIGAN Well , I do n't believe he 'd bother Allen . CATHERINE FERREBY He has been with my daughter alone in his house many , many times , and no harm done . ROBERT FERREBY We had two babysitters , but CATHERINE FERREBY ( Riding over . ) There have been no sex crimes in this area . JIMMY RAY BOSUN Well CATHERINE FERREBY Within a wide area . He 's been a good neighbor . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclude he had to be privately or publicly told to move on . Now I think this should be laid to rest with thanks to the Bosuns for their time and information . You can count on our being watchful , but other than watchfulness there is nothing to act on here . JIMMY RAY BOSUN The man who raped and killed our Lucy , he had no record with little girls though he had previously harmed teenagers . He raped Lucy several times over six hours in a an old gas station . Strangled her on a cement floor , threw her in the trunk of his car , took her back where he had a power saw , did the rest of what he did ( Reaches in his coat. ) sometime during all that he must have stepped on her glasses ( He puts the glasses on the coffee table . ) See it turned out Charles DeYoung Charles Gabriel DeYoung to quote his full name well prior to Lucy he had confided to a couple people he had this rape record served time but like this here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , that department , it later came out and the people he told , well they did n't tell no one . Had their reasons I do n't doubt . So I have Tianna and me come to have a real firm belief in notification . Insiders , outsiders , whatever . ( A moment . ) Could be this Walker R. Bundy , to quote his full name well , there is differences between him and Mr. DeYoung . ( To Catherine . ) Like you said about his age , all the different things . You can get him outta here private if you 're willing to take that chance . I figure I 'll give you three days to do that , but I want to make this clear There is no place for these people next door anywhere . I find ' em , I 'm gon na move ' em on for eternity . I will give them no rest and no roof . I will cast them out . Because any place I know they are I would be just too likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall not kill , and I ca n't afford to be too tempted . I kid you not . You move him on or I 'll move him on . It 's going to happen one way or the other . ( A moment . ) Time to go , Tianna . ( She rises . ) We 'd like to thank you for the fellowship . Thanks for the time in your home . ( He picks up the glasses . ) Only time I cried was when I saw these glasses . Ai n't that somethin ' ? Go on , Tianna . ( Turns back . ) I 'll be in touch . ( The lights go down but not out . As they come back up , Robert and Catherine are alone . It is minutes later. ) p. 57 CATHERINE FERREBY I do n't think this is right . Why did n't you say something ? ROBERT FERREBY I did say something . CATHERINE FERREBY That gay is n't environmental ? ROBERT FERREBY He was using that to leverage Mrs. McGuigan . CATHERINE FERREBY I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bundy out of here . ROBERT FERREBY I do n't know where I am on that . CATHERINE FERREBY You 're kidding me ? ROBERT FERREBY No , I do n't know . CATHERINE FERREBY Robert you had an affair , should they move you on ? Out you ? Run pickets in front of the house and pass out leaflets ? ROBERT FERREBY Come on , Catherine CATHERINE FERREBY No , turn it around . My dad had two drunken-driving arrests in the eighties . He still drives , is n't that a neighborhood issue ? ROBERT FERREBY Obviously not the same CATHERINE FERREBY Why not ? He caused a very serious accident . The woman he hit had a child in the car . He still drinks , he still drives . Would n't everybody here be safer if we moved him on to Florida ? p. 58 ROBERT FERREBY Okay , okay , we 're both upset CATHERINE FERREBY Did it ever cross your mind that he could sue us ? ROBERT FERREBY He 'd never get away with it . CATHERINE FERREBY Are you kidding ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CATHERINE FERREBY In this day and age ? ROBERT FERREBY He 'd lose . CATHERINE FERREBY Robert , think about it ROBERT FERREBY But we have this child CATHERINE FERREBY Are you patronizing me ? ROBERT FERREBY you love better than anything fifty feet from this guy . CATHERINE FERREBY Yes , I do love her and he 's not interested in little girls . ROBERT FERREBY Interested enough to have her over there every spare minute . CATHERINE FERREBY Older people like children , Robert . ROBERT FERREBY They do , yes . Listen , you remember when those kids used to climb our wall to get up on the garage roof ? Nobody ever fell , but you were the one who insisted we pay eight hundred dollars to take down the wall . So , the real question , you know , the heart of it is , why take any chance with this guy at all . p. 59 CATHERINE FERREBY Because I do n't know . ROBERT FERREBY Then let 's not , okay ? CATHERINE FERREBY Because I know him . Because he drinks coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not right to do harm to someone who drinks coffee in your kitchen . ROBERT FERREBY Catherine CATHERINE FERREBY No , no I there 's no because sometimes you have to take chances to stay human or because I know he 's maybe because I 'm too fragile to do harm right now . ROBERT FERREBY You 're not fragile , you 're rock . CATHERINE FERREBY Is that what you see ? Oh , Robert never mind , look Mr. Bundy is n't a wall we can tear down hold on it 's easy to move to extremes here , really , it can be seductive feels really active to make assumptions that Robert , he has lost those drives or controlled them . ROBERT FERREBY Catherine , there is no way in this world to be sure of that . CATHERINE FERREBY He 's demonstrated it . ROBERT FERREBY He may still do it and he has n't been caught . p. 60 CATHERINE FERREBY Nobody condones what he did thirteen years ago , but you ca n't run a society with life sentences for every crime , Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he go ? CATHERINE FERREBY He has to live somewhere . ROBERT FERREBY Maybe he drives fifty miles and hangs out in the malls . CATHERINE FERREBY So the moral imperative is to move him on to somebody else 's mall ? ROBERT FERREBY Do n't give me that . That 's not how you react . There is nobody nobody fiercer than you are about protecting your family nobody . CATHERINE FERREBY Then why am I not concerned , Bobby ? We may both work but you know I 'm the basic safety net for Cassie . I screen the babysitters , I check out the camps , I 'm the one who has coffee with Mr. Bundy . Why should your view prevail now ? ROBERT FERREBY Because of what I feel , okay ? I do n't agree , in this case , to take any risk whatsoever with Cassie . Bundy be damned . I do n't agree , okay ? CATHERINE FERREBY Honey , not taking risks is one thing , riding him out of town on a rail is another . ROBERT FERREBY And both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's overkill , Robert , until all these people are put on an island , we have to cope . We ca n't just ruin his life to get a statistical edge . ROBERT FERREBY He already ruined his life . CATHERINE FERREBY Where are you coming from ? Who drags me to church every Sunday ? Who tells me we do n't need prayer in the schools but we do need Christian ethics taught in the classroom ? Forgiveness is a central Christian precept . Bobby , I am back in this house on that principle . I am busy forgiving you as we speak . Do you want to be forgiven ? ROBERT FERREBY No fair . CATHERINE FERREBY Do you ? ROBERT FERREBY Yes , I do . You know I do . CATHERINE FERREBY Well , so does Mr. Bundy , Robert , so what do we do now ? ROBERT FERREBY Beyond what I may feel here , or you may feel here , the fact is that Jimmy Ray took this out of our hands . CATHERINE FERREBY No he did n't . ROBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of here before he saw to it it became a community issue . He will go to the papers . You saw his eyes . He 'll go door to door . CATHERINE FERREBY And if he does that ? p. 62 ROBERT FERREBY Yes ? What is that supposed to mean ? CATHERINE FERREBY Then we would convince the neighborhood to leave him alone . ROBERT FERREBY You what ? ! Do you people are n't going to listen on this issue . This is n't the International Debate Society CATHERINE FERREBY I never said ROBERT FERREBY with points for style and research . Catherine , people fear and hate these guys , and with good reason . CATHERINE FERREBY And sometimes that 's wrong . ROBERT FERREBY And sometimes listen , what you suggest is the quickest way imaginable to become the biggest pariah in a hundred-mile radius . CATHERINE FERREBY Robert , how can you we 're not talking about reputation here . We have several responsibilities . ROBERT FERREBY Oh , my God . Can we get real here , okay ? We bought a house we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school district . I work in an advertising agency that is downsizing , and my job is to baby corporate clients whose personal politics are a little to the right of Vulcan the Barbarian . They should see me on local TV fronting for this issue ? How would you like us to be moved on to another town ? p. 63 CATHERINE FERREBY So it 's not worry about Cassie , it 's economic ? ROBERT FERREBY ( Slapping the table . ) Do n't you dare say that to me ! CATHERINE FERREBY You said it . ROBERT FERREBY You know exactly what I mean ! CATHERINE FERREBY Yes , unfortunately . ROBERT FERREBY That guy is a sociopath ( She throws up her hands. ) no morals , no judgment , he proved it ! CATHERINE FERREBY Whatever . ROBERT FERREBY And no , it 's not economic , it 's Cassie . The time she 's spent over there makes my skin crawl , but all that all that aside , you stood in this room and agreed with me that it was off-limits for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FERREBY Yes , I did agree , but that house has a slide and swings . She was n't in the house . You wo n't even buy her a swing set . As a matter of fact , your chief argument was she could use the one over there . When I saw she 'd gone over there I called her back . Why do n't you come home on Saturdays and you can watch her ! ROBERT FERREBY ( Boiling . ) I do n't want her over there , do you hear me ? You see that she does n't go over there , is that clear ? I should n't even have to bring this up . Now you see it does n't happen . p. 64 CATHERINE FERREBY I do n't know who you think I am , but I do n't take instructions . ROBERT FERREBY Do not let Cassidy go anywhere near there . ( A pause . ) CATHERINE FERREBY Bobby , I am going to go over and talk to Mr. Bundy . I am going to tell him what we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him there is likely to be trouble . I 'm going to suggest he agree , in writing , to stay away from neighborhood children of any sex and age , and should he transgress that agreement we will have Jimmy Ray and Tianna make his life the living hell they suggest . I will then communicate this information to the Bosuns , and ask them not to proceed further . If they do I will organize support for Mr. Bundy , and what you do at that point is entirely up to you . I hope you will join me , but I have no " instructions " for you . I loved you once , and I came back here because I thought I could love you again . I think that 's what we 've been working on and hoping for . ( A moment . ) I understand what you feel , truly I do . It 's just not what I feel . I wish it was . ( A pause . ) So , anyway , I think I should go over and see Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot to me if you would come with me . ( Pause . ) Robert ? p. 65 ROBERT FERREBY I 'll come with you . ( They look at each other . ) CATHERINE FERREBY Thank you . ( The lights fade and while they change to the furniture representing Mr. Bundy 's living room , Tianna steps into a spotlight . ) TIANNA BOSUN Hey , I 'm not getting fancy here , y'know , but , girlfriends , it probably comes down , do n't you think , to whether there is such things as good an ' evil ? I mean , I 'm no preacher now , shoot no , but I feel like we just got to come down on some side of that fence . Because evil , well if there was such a thing as that , well I do n't think you can forgive evil , can you ? Sure they got theologians , such as that , been working all this , but for simple folks I do n't mean dumb now well , you know how I 'd put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you read the paper , some of these things people do , do n't you just think " that there is evil " like the word just attaches itself you just ca n't explain it any other way . And the things you use that word on are n't any kind of a thing you can understand out of your human experience . These are acts you could n't do , nor could anybody you know or ever met do those things , and yet they are done . They are done . So I believe that it does exist and , down where our instincts are , we know that . People who do evil , we ca n't recognize them as human , and this " evil " is beyond explanation , beyond forgiveness , an ' beggin ' your pardon here , they got to be stamped out or driven back to that darkness from which they come . Because once evil is the name of a thing , I say give it no quarter . ' Course as I say , I 'm a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands . ) Got real nice finger polish though , do n't I ? Been likin ' the red/brown tones , but I 'm tryin ' to get up the nerve to do ' em blue . ( The lights come up on Catherine , Robert , and Mr. Bundy in his living room . He is filling their kitchen glasses with lemonade. ) p. 66 CATHERINE FERREBY So the thing is , Mr. Bundy , the thing is , we we know now you have a criminal record . ROBERT FERREBY We did n't go looking for it . CATHERINE FERREBY Nothing you did someone outside brought it to our attention . MR . BUNDY Oh no . CATHERINE FERREBY I 'm sorry , I know it was a long time ago . MR . BUNDY I prayed to God against this . CATHERINE FERREBY I know that you MR . BUNDY I 'm on my knees every day that I could live this down for all these years . ROBERT FERREBY ( Seeing the tipping pitcher . ) You 're spilling the lemonade . ( He looks nonplussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemonade , Mr. Bundy . MR . BUNDY Oh . I 'm sorry . CATHERINE FERREBY Are you all right ? MR . BUNDY All right ? CATHERINE FERREBY Why do n't you sit down , Mr. Bundy ? p. 67 MR . BUNDY You see , I wanted to have myself castrated . I looked into that . CATHERINE FERREBY Mr. Bundy , do n't . MR . BUNDY No , I suppose you are not interested in my regrets . CATHERINE FERREBY Mr. Bundy we have to talk about this , I 'm sorry . MR . BUNDY I should clean up the lemonade . CATHERINE FERREBY I 'll do it . MR . BUNDY This carpet CATHERINE FERREBY It 's all right . MR . BUNDY Stupid . CATHERINE FERREBY Mr. Bundy , you 've probably been wondering why Cassie has n't been over . MR . BUNDY She is a beautiful child . I would never harm a child . CATHERINE FERREBY This is hard . This is so hard . ROBERT FERREBY Do you want me CATHERINE FERREBY No . No , it 's all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's as much for your sake as it is for hers . It would be I would still be pleased if you came over for coffee . ( Robert shifts position . Mr. Bundy notices . ) Mr. Bundy , there is some chance of this becoming public knowledge . ( Mr. Bundy sits with a hand over his face . ) Not from us . I do think there might be a way to head that off . p. 68 MR . BUNDY You can see some things are still in boxes . I 've moved nine times in thirteen years . It 's pretty hard . I uh well , probably I deserve to be humiliated like they do but , my uh nerves are pretty bad now pretty bad and uh I do n't know if you know my age ? ( They nod . ) So uh , I get very nervous about things . I was hoping not to move again so soon . One time they filled up my car with feces . They spray paint things on my house . Killed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog my sister gave me . ROBERT FERREBY Could you go to your sister , Mr. Bundy ? MR . BUNDY I do n't believe she could afford to be singled out where she lives . CATHERINE FERREBY I do n't think you have to move , Mr. Bundy . I 'm not in favor of that . ( She hands him a piece of paper from a file folder . ) I wondered perhaps if you would feel you could sign this ? ( He reads it . ) You know if you if you could , I think we could use it um to defuse anything , well , that came up . But if you MR . BUNDY Damn children these damn children ! I 'm not I do n't harm them ! ( Robert rises . ) I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . God help me . ( A pause . ) I uh yes , whatever you want I could sign this . I 'm surprised you offer any kind of help . They would they would drive me out though anyway . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Like the crying . I 'm not in control of it . ( Puts his hands in his pockets . ) I would ask if you could give me till the eighteenth . All my sister 's money is in this house . I do n't know if you know I work weekends at the uh the clothing outlet on Route 62 they pay every two weeks . I would need that money when I go . p. 69 CATHERINE FERREBY Where would you go , Mr. Bundy ? MR . BUNDY Ca n't say . Somewhere else . Get some boxes . List the house . I do n't know . I guess it does n't matter where I go . I would n't be there too long . CATHERINE FERREBY Mr. Bundy , I think you have paid . I do n't think you need to pay anymore . You are welcome to live next door to me . My husband feels it is inappropriate for you to see Cassie . I do n't know perhaps I do too . He feels it strongly and I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think we should address that with Cassie with you there . ( Seeing Robert 's expression . ) I do , Robert . MR . BUNDY I do n't believe I can go through this . To stay . I 've been having some irregular heartbeat . Nervous uh nervous conditions . ( Wipes his eyes . ) I cry quite a bit over over I do n't know what . I do n't I ca n't listen to them shouting outside the house anymore . ROBERT FERREBY Perhaps then , the best thing CATHERINE FERREBY If you had to go through it if it came to that I believe , after all these years there would be people here who would feel this should stop now . Myself people from our church some of the people in the neighborhood p. 70 ROBERT FERREBY Catherine , I believe I 'll go back over to the house . I CATHERINE FERREBY ( Continuing to Mr. Bundy. ) and after awhile they would n't shout anymore , and you could be done with it . I would encourage you to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Pause . ) ROBERT FERREBY I 'll be there when you finish . CATHERINE FERREBY Please stay . ROBERT FERREBY Good-bye , Mr. Bundy . MR . BUNDY Oh . Yes . CATHERINE FERREBY ( To Robert . ) Just stay one minute . Mr. Bundy , I know these are hard choices but ROBERT FERREBY ( By the door , has bent over and picked something up . ) What is this ? What the hell is this ? CATHERINE FERREBY What is what ? ROBERT FERREBY This is the uh the twirly thing , you know , that uh that flying toy the spinning fairy whatsit from uh , from that thing I brought home to Cassie you know the thing come on , Catherine the toy I brought Cassie two days ago . p. 71 CATHERINE FERREBY It could be from anything . ROBERT FERREBY It 's not from anything it 's the propeller part from that thing I bought Cassidy . She 's been in here in the last two days . CATHERINE FERREBY All right , calm down . ROBERT FERREBY ( To Mr. Bundy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it clear a week ago CATHERINE FERREBY We 'll talk at home . ROBERT FERREBY No , we wo n't talk at home ! Listen , Mr. Bundy , I do n't want my daughter in here ! I do n't give a rat 's ass about your nerves or your palpitations , I do n't want Cassidy anywhere near you , okay ? I do n't care what kind of pals you are with Catherine , I do n't care how many years it 's been , if my child knocks on your door you tell her , in no uncertain terms , she is not welcome . I ca n't believe this . I 'm going to say this so everybody clearly , clearly understands it . If I ever find out you have spoken to my daughter , other than to send her home , I am going to hurt you , you understand , do you harm ( To Catherine . ) Do n't touch me and break up your house , smash all these things I see , these things I see here , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your front door . Does that seem clear enough to you ? ( To Catherine . ) Do you not listen to me ? ( To Bundy . ) She was over here two days ago , and she better not ever , God help you , be over here again ! ( He slams out. ) p. 72 CATHERINE FERREBY ( To Bundy . ) Are you all right ? MR . BUNDY ( Shaking his head . ) I uh I uh ( They stand . Neither can speak . Robert , who has been moving since he left , walks by Jimmy Ray leaning against a building . Bundy 's furniture is being cleared . The lights dim on Bundy and Catherine , who exit . ) JIMMY RAY BOSUN Hey , buddy . ( Robert stops and looks at him . He looks down and then back up . ) ROBERT FERREBY What do you want ? JIMMY RAY BOSUN Been waitin ' on you . ROBERT FERREBY I work right over there . JIMMY RAY BOSUN Yeah , I know , I did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? JIMMY RAY BOSUN I said I 'd be in touch . You want a cigarette ? ( Robert shakes his head " no . " ) You on the non-smokin ' committee ? ( A thin smile . ) Who runs your family , boy ? ROBERT FERREBY What are you talking about ? JIMMY RAY BOSUN There ai n't squat goin ' on is what I 'm talkin ' about . Bundy just sits there . What are you , pussywhipped ? p. 73 ROBERT FERREBY Good-bye , Mr. Bosun . ( He starts off . ) JIMMY RAY BOSUN Your kid said to give you this note from her teacher . Somethin ' about parents ' night , somethin ' like that . ( Holds it out . Robert takes it and opens it . ) ROBERT FERREBY Where did you get this ? JIMMY RAY BOSUN I went down to see your girl , ask her a few questions . ROBERT FERREBY You went no you talked to Cassie at her school ? JIMMY RAY BOSUN Yeah , I dropped by . ROBERT FERREBY Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was any of your business . JIMMY RAY BOSUN Me either , pal ROBERT FERREBY That 's right JIMMY RAY BOSUN I think it was your business ROBERT FERREBY Hold it JIMMY RAY BOSUN but you did n't take care of it so I had to make it ROBERT FERREBY Hold it . JIMMY RAY BOSUN my business . p. 74 ROBERT FERREBY ( Finger in his face . ) Do n't you ever JIMMY RAY BOSUN ( Uninflected . ) Do n't go there , man ( An explosive moment . ) Do n't go there , Bobby-Bobby . ( The potential passes . ) Now you want to know what I know , or you do n't care ? ROBERT FERREBY What ? JIMMY RAY BOSUN ( Reaching out to his lapel . ) You got something stuck to your coat there . You remember how when Bundy abused those boys , he got ' em to put on women 's clothes ? ROBERT FERREBY Yes . JIMMY RAY BOSUN He dressed your girl up too . ROBERT FERREBY No . JIMMY RAY BOSUN Yeah , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAY BOSUN She told me . ROBERT FERREBY In what way dressed her up ? JIMMY RAY BOSUN Had her undress , Bobby , had her put on some special little outfit he had an idea she should wear . ROBERT FERREBY Why ? p. 75 JIMMY RAY BOSUN Do n't believe she said " why . " ROBERT FERREBY And then what ? JIMMY RAY BOSUN I figure that 's your question to ask . ROBERT FERREBY ( To himself . ) Goddamnit . JIMMY RAY BOSUN Lord 's name . ROBERT FERREBY He had her undress ? JIMMY RAY BOSUN So she said . ROBERT FERREBY ( Controlled . ) Is that all of what you have to say to me ? JIMMY RAY BOSUN You 're a piece of work , man . ROBERT FERREBY I think we 're done now . JIMMY RAY BOSUN Where are you , buddy ? ROBERT FERREBY Get out of my face . JIMMY RAY BOSUN I think you 're about three bricks shy of a load , pal . What kinda man are you foolin ' with your daughter 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get him outta there , you 're gon na be real , real sorry . I do n't know where you 're at , I do n't know why you are n't takin ' care of your family and , to tell the truth , I do n't think you got any balls . When all this comes down it 's gon na be straight up your fault . Oh yeah . Oh yeah . Batter up , man . Up to you , Bobby , big time . ( Starts off . ) Do n't forget parents ' night . ( He leaves . The lights come down . Cassidy steps into a spot . Behind her they reset the kitchen table and chairs. ) p. 76 CASSIDY FERREBY Mr. Bundy told me that you should never go with a strange person and if they try to the bad person to pull you , you should yell and say , " You are n't my father . You are n't my mother ! " Which is pretty stupid because nobody ever pays attention to kids anyway . Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daddy in the mall and everybody just laughed or smiled , or did n't even look when he carried her out . He was really mad , too . Why would anyone want to hurt a kid anyways ? It 's so stupid . ( The lights come up in the Ferreby kitchen . Cassidy and Catherine are seated at the table . Robert is on his feet talking to the child . ) ROBERT FERREBY It 's not stupid . I want you to look at me , Cassidy . I said look at me ! CATHERINE FERREBY Do n't scare her . ROBERT FERREBY There are times to be scared . There are times when it is sensible and useful . Now you went over there when we told you very clearly you should not . CASSIDY FERREBY No . ROBERT FERREBY Do n't lie to me , Cassidy . CASSIDY FERREBY I did n't . ROBERT FERREBY You went over there a day later . CASSIDY FERREBY Just to play on the swings . p. 77 ROBERT FERREBY Was your mother watching you ? CATHERINE FERREBY Robert ROBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Cassidy looks at her mother . ) CATHERINE FERREBY It 's all right , honey . CASSIDY FERREBY Just to play on the swings . ROBERT FERREBY ( To Catherine . ) You knew . CATHERINE FERREBY There is no reason she ca n't play outside there . ROBERT FERREBY There is every reason but the simplest reason is we agreed she should n't . CATHERINE FERREBY That is n't what we agreed . ROBERT FERREBY How do you have the nerve to say that to my face ? CASSIDY FERREBY I do n't like it when you fight . ROBERT FERREBY We 're not fighting , Cassidy . CASSIDY FERREBY You are too . ROBERT FERREBY I want you to be quiet , Cassidy . CASSIDY FERREBY Oh fine . ( She turns away from him. ) p. 78 ROBERT FERREBY Were you watching her on the swings ? After you sent her over there CATHERINE FERREBY I did n't send her over there . ROBERT FERREBY Did you watch her , Catherine ! CATHERINE FERREBY What 's the matter with you ? ROBERT FERREBY Because if I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be someone else here . CASSIDY FERREBY I do n't want someone else . ROBERT FERREBY I told you to be quiet ! CATHERINE FERREBY Now you 're scaring both of us . ROBERT FERREBY What is the matter with you ? What is the matter with both of you ? She did n't just play on the swings . Your mom and I told you that for grown-up reasons it was dangerous . CASSIDY FERREBY Swings are n't dangerous . CATHERINE FERREBY To be fair , Robert , what we said was ROBERT FERREBY There were a lot of things we did n't say because of you . CATHERINE FERREBY ( Going to get Cassidy out of her chair . ) Come on , Cassie. p. 79 ROBERT FERREBY Not yet . CATHERINE FERREBY Come to Mommy . ROBERT FERREBY Are you deaf , I said " not yet . " CATHERINE FERREBY I think we should cool off now . ROBERT FERREBY I want to know now , Cassidy , if you went in the house ? And I want to know , clearly , if your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes . ROBERT FERREBY " Okay , yes " what ? CASSIDY FERREBY For one minute . ROBERT FERREBY Cassidy Catherine , yes or no , did you know ? CATHERINE FERREBY Is this your I do n't know what tough guy act ? ROBERT FERREBY Give me a straight answer ! CATHERINE FERREBY And are you more concerned about what she did in the house or whether you 've been obeyed ? ROBERT FERREBY I 'm not here to consider the fine points , Catherine , it seems to me I 've made myself pretty clear . We agreed she would n't go in the house , and she was in the house . CASSIDY FERREBY I wanted my train . p. 80 ROBERT FERREBY What train ? CATHERINE FERREBY The lawn decoration they 'd been making together for weeks . ROBERT FERREBY ( Punching the air in frustration . ) You let her go in there ! CATHERINE FERREBY No Robert . The furnace man showed up , so I said it would be all right to ring the bell and get the train . ROBERT FERREBY Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entirely different conversation . We can have that conversation later . Because of the furnace I might have been gone five minutes . ROBERT FERREBY Five minutes ? CATHERINE FERREBY All right , seven minutes , eight minutes . ROBERT FERREBY That is completely irresponsible ! CATHERINE FERREBY ( Explosive . ) And you are completely off the wall . CASSIDY FERREBY No fighting ! No fighting ! ( Robert stops her with his hands on her shoulders . ) ROBERT FERREBY Honey CASSIDY FERREBY Let go of me ! ( She struggles. ) p. 81 ROBERT FERREBY Stop it , Cassidy . CASSIDY FERREBY You are mean . Let go ! ROBERT FERREBY Sit in the chair . ( Trying to break free , she accidentally hits him in the face and is momentarily free . In reaction , he lifts her roughly off her feet and over-firmly puts her back in the chair . ) Do n't hit me ! CATHERINE FERREBY Leave her alone , Robert . ( She starts for the chair . ) ROBERT FERREBY ( Warning her off . ) I 'm talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off Cassidy . ) Not like that . ROBERT FERREBY I 'm not hurting her . CASSIDY FERREBY Mommy ! CATHERINE FERREBY You are hurting her ! ( She tries to pull him away . ) ROBERT FERREBY Get off me , Catherine . CATHERINE FERREBY Just leave her alone . ROBERT FERREBY ( As he pushes her away . ) I am talking to her . ( With the momentum of the push , Catherine missteps and falls to a sitting position on the floor. ) p. 82 CASSIDY FERREBY Mommy !
