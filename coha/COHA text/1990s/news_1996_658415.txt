<p> Justin Waldsmith dips a test tube into the Illinois River and squints at the cloudy brown liquid , the main source of drinking water for his hometown of East Peoria . <p> " The biggest pollutant here is from soil erosion , " explains Justin , a lanky high school senior . Runoff from farms laces the river water with fertilizers , herbicides , and pesticides , he says . <p> Justin and the 1,200 students at East Peoria High School are monitoring the Illinois as part of an award-winning environmental project that closely links classroom learning with efforts to protect regional rivers . <p> As an estimated 24,000 Americans turn out for National River Cleanup Week ( May 11-18 ) , the five-year-old East Peoria project shows how communities can foster the stewardship of fragile river ecosystems over the long run . <p> Grass-roots support for river revival is surging in schools as well as city halls nationwide as hundreds of communities work to enhance the economic , tourism , and recreational value of their waterways , officials and environmentalists say . <p> All state 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Massachusetts , and California . In Illinois alone , more than 170 schools have started monitoring river water since 1990 under a national River Project coordinated by Southern Illinois University ( SIU ) in Edwardsville , Ill . All the state 's rivers are now student-monitored , according to Robert Williams , who directs the SIU project . <p> " The way to encourage stewardship for the rivers is by starting in schools like East Peoria , " says Victor McMahan , director of urban river programs at American Rivers , a Washington-based environmental group . <p> In March , American Rivers granted East Peoria High School one of 16 national awards for restoring urban rivers . <p> " What makes this program exceptional is that it makes the river a hands-on educational tool . It becomes a classroom for the students - literally , " Mr. McMahan says . Indeed , one day the school transported more than 1,000 students and teachers to " classes " set up along the riverbank . <p> By making river cleanup the focus of a multidisciplinary curriculum , the East Peoria project helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special relevance , and spark student enthusiasm for conservation and community activism . <p> The project began in 1991 and has several major components , including : <p> *Science . Students using computerized monitoring equipment on loan from the government check the water quality of the Illinois , Mackinaw , and other nearby rivers . The data , along with findings reported by about 170 other schools , are regularly transmitted via the Internet to Southern Illinois University . From there , they go to the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources where they are used to supplement government data . <p> " Because of cutbacks , the state does not have enough people in the field , " Dr. Williams says . Local watchdogging by students provides valuable monitoring data at a minimal cost . <p> Justin , for example , is tracking how nitrates from farming fertilizers are affecting levels of nitrogen in the Mackinaw River about 20 miles from his school . Considered the cleanest remaining stretch of river in Illinois , the Mackinaw is a focus of state conservation efforts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high volume and rapid flow have diluted the pollutants and kept their levels down . <p> Other students have researched the impact on Illinois rivers of the rapid proliferation of the zebra mussel , an invasive species from Europe . <p> *English . Writing assignments often involve interviews with community members and field research on river-related topics . <p> " When students are researching their own community , they care about what they say and how they say it , " says English teacher Georgeann Siwicke . <p> Ms. Siwicke and 1,000 other teachers nationwide are writing a complete river-centered curriculum to be published this fall by Addison-Wesley . <p> River stories for kids <p> Siwicke sometimes asks students to rewrite their research papers imaginatively as children 's books . One such book describes a trip to a planet with pristine water . Others tell the story of endangered species such as the river otter . During a riverside picnic , the students read their books and present them as gifts to grade-school youngsters . <p> *Art . Students sketch and paint the river , and make prints and crafts using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion pinch pots from river clay . Especially popular are the native American " dream catchers " they create by bending willow branches into hoops and weaving them with feathers , shells , or other natural objects found near the river . <p> " Incorporating art with the river makes the river experience more personal because the kids go home with something they have made , " says art teacher Susan Dion . <p> Ms. Dion says that exposure to the arts through the river curriculum has drawn some students to her courses who previously lacked interest in art . <p> Each spring , a year of river learning culminates in a state-wide student River Congress and Clean Water Celebration in Peoria . Dubbed " the most important classroom in the entire United States " by Valdus Adamkus , regional director of the US Environmental Protection Agency , the unique two-day event started in 1991 with 250 students and this year attracted 3,500 . <p> On the first day at the River Congress , about 500 high school students present their research findings to each other . <p> The following day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thousands of middle- and grade-school youths as well as to the broader community . The students set up dozens of river exhibits in booths that are interspersed with educational displays by government organizations , environmental groups , and companies . <p> Still , while Justin and other East Peoria students are avid river watchdogs and scientists , they are dredging up no easy solutions to the contamination in the Illinois and other regional rivers . <p> Flowing between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi , the Illinois has suffered decades of ecological destruction since the turn of the century , when it teemed with fish , mussels , and river fowl . <p> In the early 1900s , a dramatic population increase along the Illinois led to the diversion of sewage and industrial waste into the river . More-stringent water pollution laws and better waste treatment began to alleviate the problem in the 1920s <p> Students talk to farmers <p> The greatest damage to the river has occurred since the 1930s , as the rise of mechanized , large-scale farming of annual row crops like corn and soybeans has led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river , reducing its flow and oxygen levels . <p> " It 's frustrating for the kids when they go into the fields and see the water rushing off , " Williams says . <p> In recent years , East Peoria students have held discussions with farmers and been heartened by the growing popularity of no-till cultivation which has helped reduced soil erosion . But the no-till method requires greater use of herbicides like atrazine and threatens to put additional toxic chemicals into the Illinois . <p> Nevertheless , student river advocates are receiving a boost from another economic force in East Peoria : a multimillion-dollar drive to develop the riverfront . <p> The city of 22,000 people seeks to reverse a population decline from the loss of heavy industry jobs by promoting tourism , and hosting a controversial riverboat gambling casino . A 600-berth marina and housing complex are under way , as are riverfront shops , restaurants , and parks . <p> " We have a long-term interest in maintaining the river , " says city spokesman Jay Thompson .

Josh Thompson plans to become an architect with an emphasis on riverfront designs . Devon Schaub hopes to put her testing of well water to use in a medical job .
