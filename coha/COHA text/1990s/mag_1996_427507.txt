Section : Speaking Out <p> " Enthusiasm is at the bottom of all progress . With it , there is accomplishment ; without it , there are only alibis . " <p> During my years in sales and management for a large pharmaceutical firm , I was fortunate to have some autonomy as marketing vice president for a sales and marketing division . This allowed me to practice a concept that was somewhat new to the top brass of the parent company . <p> Namely , humor . Lightening up meetings with a joke or two had never been a part of this excellent company 's management philosophy . In fact , it was viewed as a sign of weakness , and I was criticized for doing it , but I found that humor made a world of difference in the attitudes of those who worked with me . <p> Too many companies still rely on fear rather than more productive means to motivate their employees . A recent study bears out my belief that humor improves corporate efficiency . When researchers monitored the effect of humor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the managers who used humor the most had the highest levels of employee performance . <p> Humor is the kinder , gentler approach , and it 's undoubtedly better than humiliation for improving people 's attitudes . <p> Changing attitudes , by the way , is the primary function of management . A sales manager 's main responsibility is not to do all the selling himself , which would hardly be possible , but to create a climate within the group so that each individual can be the best that he or she can be . <p> Someone once said that before learning can take place in a classroom , the students must view the professor as part of the solution rather than part of the problem . The same is true for managers . If the group wants the sales manager to fail , they will literally destroy their own careers to assure that he meets with little success . On the other hand , if they feel their manager is part of the solution , they will over-achieve . <p> I have seen sales districts blossom overnight by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Positive <p> Humor is one tool that can change attitudes . At the very least it can make a manager appear more human . Another method I recommend is that managers take a positive approach . For most new managers , the virue of aggressiveness has more to do with their promotion than any other single factor . And ironically , this can be a handicap as they begin their management career . New managers are always eager to jump right in and start demonstrating to their group how to be successful . They are often surprised when I tell them that for the first few weeks they should do little except observe and listen . When they do start making suggestions , they should emphasize the positive , rather than simply point out mistakes . <p> I use this example : if a policeman were to follow me as I drive from the office to my home , even though I knew he was there , I would probably do things that he would consider traffic violations . His attitude toward me would not be very good . Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You all know the facial expression when he pulls you over  --  that " Aha-I've-got-you " look . I 've never yet been pulled over to be told what a great driver I am . The policeman 's job requires him to focus on the negative . Effective managers , on the other hand , should begin by focusing on what people are doing right . When you are looking for what is right , your mindset is completely different . If you concentrate on the positives , the negatives always fall away . You do n't really have to spend much time dwelling on them because they become obvious . Three Tiers of Performance <p> I have found there are three tiers of people in every sales organization , and this may be true in other organizations as well . <p> The top performers represent about 20 percent of the total ; the marginal performers represent another 15 to 20 percent , and the rest are in the middle . A manager should spend most of his time with the middle group , boosting enthusiasm and relating ideas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivators I have found are : 1 ) getting those under you promoted ( nothing makes a manager look better ) , and 2 ) eliminating bad performers . A manager should investigate the problems of the lowest performing group and do what he can to help . Sometimes low performance is the result of personal problems , but often those people just are n't as capable as others . My heart goes out to them more than anybody else , and I believe they should be humanely encouraged into other areas where they have a better chance of succeeding . <p> As for the top performers , I never needed to speak to them about increasing sales , but I had a technique for getting them to perform even better , which I admit I learned at the racetrack . What stimulates the top thoroughbreds is nothing more than the sound of thundering hoof beats coming from the back to challenge them . When they hear this , the adrenaline starts flowing and they quickly distance themselves from the sounds of the oncoming pack . Top performers love a challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch them , they will do even better . Stimulus and Response <p> But managers can not simply lump workers into specific groups . They must gain knowledge of each individual as it relates to accomplishing the task at hand . When it comes to changing attitudes , not all people respond to the same stimuli . Managers must understand that everyone is different and has different talents , skills , interests , needs , and wants . <p> Individuals can benefit from this , too . Successful people make the most of those differences by building on their own special strengths . <p> Lou Holtz , the noted football coach at Notre Dame , tells many stories about his star players . In every case , they learned to excel not by measuring how well they performed in comparison to other members of the team , but by how well they performed in terms of their personal capabilities . The army recruiting slogan , " Be all that you can be , " is an example of this way of thinking . Lou Holtz once said that he first recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing tennis  --  by himself ! Not everyone can move like that player , but I am sure that you or I can do things that he could not do . <p> I learned the most important lesson about attitude from my father , a lifelong farmer who had little formal education . Dad was pleased when my older brother went to college to study agriculture . But my brother had not been in school long before he violated the cardinal role of education . Every time he came home , he would try to tell Dad how to farm better . He began urging Dad to attend local farm meetings put on by county agents . Dad made a few appearances at these meetings but never became a regular , and that frustrated my brother greatly . One day he finally came out and asked Dad why he did n't attend meetings , which he knew would help him . I 've never forgotten Dad 's reply : " I do n't go because I am not farming as well as I know how right now . " In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I can do . " <p> Dad was n't criticizing education . He was convinced that his own attitude or desire to do better could greatly improve his productivity , irrespective of additional education . I have been observing people at work for more than 30 years , and I have yet to meet the person , including myself , who could n't perform the job better if he simply had the desire . The major factors to increased performance are attitude , desire , and belief that you can do it . <p> Roger Bannister refused to acknowledge that the four-minute mile was impossible . In 1954 he set a new record of 3:59.4 by breaking through a self-limiting attitude that was held by many runners at that time . <p> Some years back , our parent company transferred its largest pharmaceutical product to our marketing division to make way for a new antibiotic that they would be promoting exclusively . Selling the old drug would be our division 's responsibility . This was not entirely good news , because the sales of the old drug were expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a real challenge and an opportunity . Not only did the sales not decline , they actually increased each year until the patent expired , at which time it was still the company 's largest selling product . This was a perfect example of what a motivated sales force can accomplish . Three Sales Essentials <p> What makes the difference between a good sales force and an outstanding one ? In my experience , three things . First , outstanding sales representatives must see themselves as important persons . Selling is a tough job that requires a lot of self-confidence . Second , they must view their job as important . Third , they must feel good about their company and its products and most especially about their manager , who for most of them is the company . They must perceive that the company is solidly behind them and supports them in every way . If so , they will radiate what I choose to call " infectious enthusiasm . " This makes people want to do business with them , and they will be seen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , enthusiasm for the job , the product , the company , or the mission makes the decisive difference . Henry Ford said , " You can do anything if you have enthusiasm . It is the yeast that makes your hope rise to the stars . It is the sparkle in your eye , the wing in your gait , the grip in your hand , the irresistible surge of your will , and the energy to execute ideas . Enthusiasm is at the bottom of all progress . With it , there is accomplishment ; without it , there are only alibis . " Enjoy the Trip <p> There is one other point that merits pondering . Often we take ourselves too seriously . We get so engrossed in our jobs that our energy is consumed , leaving little time for anyone or anything else . The Bible says it does not profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul . There is no comfort in achieving career success and losing one 's family and other things one deems truly important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smell the roses . " <p> Life is a journey , not a destination . It would be terrible to arrive at the final goal without enjoying the trip . I firmly believe that you ca n't do anything very well for very long unless you are having at least a little fun along the way . <p> ILLUSTRATION : " We 're looking for an aggressive , tenacious salesperson , like , for instance , the one who sold you that suit .
