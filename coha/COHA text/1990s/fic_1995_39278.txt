There comes a time in each man 's life when he needs to justify his personal history . <p> He opens his window to the morning breeze , and answers when his neighbor calls , " Morning , Mr. Daaga . How you do this morning ? " <p> " I 'm there . " But his mind is elsewhere . <p> " You have clothes for the wash today ? " <p> " No , no . Nothing today . " <p> " So I hear what happen to the boy last night . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " You know what he police going to do with him ? " <p> " No . I do n't know . " But his mind is elsewhere , going over the decisions he had to make . <p> " They pass through here with their Jeep just when church over , and when I hear the news I say to miself ' Oh God ' because I know you went in the forest yourself . Whole night I listen to hear you come in but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Well , it was late , and I did n't brother to wake up anybody . " <p> " I give God thanks for keeping you out of their hands . But you see what does happen when children do n't hear ? Everybody warn Rodney not to have nothing to do with those hooligans . They say they 're fighting government , but they thiefing too much from people . " <p> " Well , not all of them hooligans . And Rodney , I do n't think he was in any thiefing " <p> " But he 's up there in the bush with them all this time ... " <p> " Yes . That 's why I went in yesterday evening to see if I could get him . " <p> " But you did n't succeed ... ? " <p> " No . I did n't succeed .

I could use mi own papers .... " <p> " Yes . Take your own papers , but I will give you the money .... " <p> " When I get back . When the boy home you could pay me back . " <p> " Well , I 'm in your debt already .... " <p> " You ca n't get outa that .... But you see these government police ? They 're so advantageous " <p> " They have the power .

He 's running ... <p> " They behave like they have power , but God not on their side . " " No , no . " <p> " Their time will come . Is only May-May I worry about . He is her only son . No mind he leave her on her own long time , a mama 's belly can never forget and is she I worry for . " <p> " Yes , yes . I will pass by later and see if I could give her a hand .

" <p> " Well , let me rub out the few things I have before it 's time to go . You going to garden ? " <p> " Yes . And I 'll pass by Miss May . " That 's right . Something practical to do , Voice says . But in his mind he is still running . He turns away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's still running , and he knows his end would come if he does n't hold on . Oxygen debt , oxygen debt , he reminds himself . Words to be set aside when there 's running . The dried ruts where his feet come down drive straight up through his shins and his knees begin to hurt There are two hills up ahead . Keep running . Voice in the sky says he should not remember , but he ca n't help himself . <p> He gets a cup of water from the bucket on the kitchen table . Some salt from the jar on the ledge above the table . He rubs his teeth and rinses , then bathes his face out the window . He should eat , he thinks , but he has no wish for food . There are ripe plantains hanging on the wall , and leftover fish in his cupboard . But he has no wish for food . <p> The church doors do n't stay open unless there 's service , and even if they were open he would n't go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray . It 's been years since he 's felt like praying , and he thinks of one or two , but they do n't seem suitable . Of course he knows a man should be able to drop down on his knees wherever he happens to be if he truly wants to pray . Calling for a special place , the feeling ca n't be serious . <p> He puts on his cap which is a carbon copy of the one Fidel wears , and pulls the cracked rubber boots over his bare feet . He finds the three-cornered file for his pocket , and gets his cutlass and stick from the corner . There 's work to do . First , he 'll have to cut the ground . Then begin digging the banks for yam seed . In time , the sun will be very hot . Maybe it would be better not to wear Fidel today . He gets the worn straw hat off its nail and pulls it on . It keeps his head cool . He does n't fill his water bottle at the bucket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . He pushes the door shut , and kicks the stone in place that keeps it from flying open in the wind . He gets the fork and hoe from their corner on the gallery that was never finished , and uses the long-handled hoe to skip the two empty steps where the treaders were broken off and need replacing . <p> In the yard , the para grass is still wet with dew . The sun is not yet up high enough to reach down to the pawpaw trees , but Miss Kate is already at her washtub , singing . Nobody in the road as he starts out for the garden . <p> Nice day today The fresh breeze says so . Sunny and hot , but not fiery , with white clouds passing over . Nice day , No rain today , and the work will happen smoothly . At the standpipe near the savannah he fills his bottle , then crosses the open grass into the first guava bushes going down to the ravine . With the fork and hoe on his shoulder he walks easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until Voice says clearly They have Rodney in jail this morning . You walk free . He is the best opening batsman in the village . He has a wife : although they 'll likely say she is only a girl he lives with . He has a son who is n't ready to walk yet . He has no brothers , sisters . He has a mother , old , who must find a way to make peace with her loss . They 're going to kill Rodney one of these mornings . We 've lost the opening bat many of the older heads call Stollmeyer , " he is so good . Perhaps if he was a real Stollmeyer none of this would happen and there 'd be no need for two women and a child to cry . They 're going to kill Rodney one of these mornings . Real Stollmeyers live in the rich hills around the city . They have estate . Police bow down before them . But Rodney , they will kill him as a notice to this village . Taking his life will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country where poor people want to believe law is something made for everybody . <p> He knows the litany and would rather not have to hear it . He instructs his ear not to listen , but Voice overrides .... One day they will kill him to make poor people understand , force poor people to believe we 're no more than dumb animals on this earth , with nothing to do until they say do , nothing to say until they say talk , nowhere to go until they say move . That 's what they 'll try to make us believe . But they can't. we know they ca n't . We are a spiritual people . We are an ancestral people . And not ... <p> Take it someplace else he cries silently up at Voice . I know <p> everything you have to say already . I 've gone over this countless times already .... So when they kill Rodney : when they put their rope around his neck , and open their trapdoor , and he fall .... And he forces his mind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush and bamboo , fly with Astrid the gypsy on an overnight train in Spain , then wait in the quiet , chilly dawn of Burgos while the spirits of the night return to their respective places . <p> Later her lips trembled on the slow cable ride up the mountains . She smiled , and they held hands through the slanting meadows of the Cordillera . Along the dewy green valleys dotted with sheep and spare red-topped haciendas , she cried in silence as the car slipped over on its descent into Gijon . Home , she said . Astrid , the gypsy ... <p> What shall he say to Rodney ? He 's already told the boy about his own passage down the deep sidewalk in Gijon , where she said , To strangers no one is friendly , and he must not look like one . In the lobby of the small hotel the few wracked English faces waiting for God knows what looked on disapprovingly . The pasty clerk gave her no recognition , while assuring them if there were a single room they would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidewalk once again . You must try not to look so like a stranger , she said , and squeezed harder on his hand . You must be at ease wherever you go in the world , she said . Like a sailor , no ? You have no fear of anybody . You do what is required to do , no ? Nobody lives forever . <p> Astrid , down the deep dark sidewalks , striding like a man who knows the hemispheres . Striding the way they must have centuries ago , returning from The Indies decked in shining weapons and personal sacks of gold . And laughing . Finally , all the time laughing . In the neat wooden room above the restaurant , laughing . As if they had swallowed a germ . Until the manager came to knock calling , Senor Senor Is all right , Senor ? And they ordered fish with white wine . They filled themselves on fish , bread and white wine , and then the train again where they said goodbye , because Astrid had to be back in San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he say to Rodney ? <p> The ravine runs shallow across a bed of small stones . Here , before the slight climb up to his garden , is the bend where August rains swell it into a full river , with brown water deep enough to cover a short man . Deep enough for the church baptisms near the bank , where he too had been blessedly cleansed in the name of the father , the son and the holy ghost when he was a boy . As man , he had turned his back on the church . <p> Here the water , mud , the sage , wild cane , the open sky , he feels it all much more than church . How many souls cleansed here ? How many burdens washed away , even if they find fresh backs to cling on somewhere downstream ? And his ? His burden ? To become a boy again and leave it here , could he do that ? Voice in the sky knows he carries this question , and says , Is that your choice in memory ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have memories then dance with the ancestor for whom you were named  --  Daaga . Daaga . <p> Please let that one remain in peace , he asks silently . <p> It does no good to plead with Voice yet he asks silently . Let that one remain in peace . Daaga ... Dagger ... he is overridden . Destined not to save but to cleanse the circle within reach , and going down in failure . How could a man fail destiny ? A question ubiquitous as thought itself . How does a man fail destiny ? There 's peace , perhaps safety in the answer that does not come . <p> Could it be the boy feels responsible , the way he once did , for clearing Daaga 's name ? Could it be ? <p> No answer comes . Not even when he imagines himself bound once again and waiting without blindfold to be shot . The barrack-yard at the foot of the mountains , a yard slumped back from uprisen grace and glory to unconcerned space with uniforms , and slop , and weathered walls , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . He will die one who failed his destiny . He refuses the band across his eyes , for a last look at a territory , a time , a troupe he could not transform . <p> You should n't blame your father for giving you that name , Maurice used to say . Many of us would feel honored to be named after a revolutionary , Maurice the half-blind Texas albino who saw everything used to say . To his mind Daaga was a hero . But if you want to go back and live quietly among your village people you should n't feel guilty about that . Who knows ? Perhaps that 's where the revolution really will take place , Maurice used to say . <p> Rodney 's heard Maurice 's words more than once . What more can he say ? Tell again the gypsy train from Gijon through Madrid , to Cartagena , Panama . In Mexico it took him to the tops of dead volcanoes . In Yucatan it followed the trail of the jaguar leading straight to Texas once again , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before coming to the hills of Dominica where the jungle was beautiful with long , heavy snakes wearing dark colors . But not before , and this will never be forgotten , the peasants on the road between Madrid and Toledo digging silently in the sun , as though intent on a treasure they alone could find in the folds of the dusty soil . Never to be forgotten , the woman in loose black skirts hung straight from beginning to end ; the man , equally nondescript from a distance , except for their bent backs truly rubbing the sky , and in their profile a sublime tenacity . Never to be forgotten . Not even surrounded by the fragrance of new lime blossoms in the hills outside Rousseau , with the police playing soldiers shooting up from below without aim . And all that time , living cowardly off the words of albino Maurice , as though he were indeed trapped in some inescapable calling , some danger in which he could not dare to be found wanting . <p> Where is the good in your memories ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you walk free . One of these day they will put the rope around his neck and open their trapdoor . He will fall , and jerk with his neck broken . He will die . But that wo n't mean the same thing they 're thinking . The ancestors are not at all forgetful : we honor them . They will see to it his dying is another start of something new . We die , new life dances up from the grave . But let them find that out for themselves . We 're not here to tell them nothing . We 're here to bear witness ... and he begins to run again . In the moonlit night beneath the trees he 's running and it would be the end if he could n't go on . They are back there . The hairs on the back of his neck know it . There are two hills up ahead . Dried ruts in the trace and he 'll have to go on if he twists his ankle . There were three of them . The fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should slow down until they come within earshot then break them on the hills . What the ass , is this some kind of Boston ? This is their territory . He must make it to the road . Keep running , <p> Never mind the hard ruts driving through his knees . There are two hills up ahead , although he should have come to one already . The steep one graveled halfway up to help the woodsmen and their buffalo from slipping when there 's mud . He should take the high grass there off to the right , maybe stop and hide . That 's crazy . Keep on running . But could n't he stop and give them the explanation ? Explain he is no criminal ? They could n't have seen who he was clearly back there behind the ranch . True . But did they stop to see ? The shotgun blasting like red thunder said they do n't care . They 're hunters . They catch up , he 'll be their prey . Keep running .... <p> Across the ravine where the spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet , and the morning breeze is still fresh coming off the stand of teke near the crestline . It will be a good day . The high sky says so . <p> He stops in the clump of bamboo that marks the boundary of his land to make water , then goes on through the dying peas to the ajoupa . He hangs his water bottle underneath the thatch , and sits on the bench to file his tools . He grips the handle of the cutlass between his knees and begins to sharpen . The grass in the overgrown section of the garden is tall , almost up to his knees . He will start up there under the crest and work downwards . It should take no more than up to midday to have the section cut , then he will take a rest and come back to begin forking . Whoever thought he could come to love this place the way he does ? When he was a boy the smell of damp grass and turned black soil was nauseating . He could n't get away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was his telling the boy about how he ran to London , New York , Toronto , Los Angeles , he ran and hid . Saying in response to the question whenever it occurred , that he was getting an education . And he did . He got an education . He met Maurice , Michael , Albert , Josephus . He met Betty , Rita and Lauren . Gary , Sophie , Clark and Marilyn . From classroom to classroom and brightly lit laboratories he got an education . He learned the magic of the pulmonary system . The significance of air . Then came the lengthy days observing the microscopic passage from the egg to embryo , a fascination in the unending process of differentiation . In the laboratory where the great Carver lived he followed with scarred beakers in hand , lab coats stained with soil , carbon , and acrid sulfur . Then came Fidel ... <p> Certainly it was his telling the boy how he ran until he came to a stop at Fidel that gave Rodney ideas about warriorhood .... His talk about time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by day , visions of a liberated world at night , the two one and the same ... his talk that teased the boy into fathoming new life .... <p> Under his file the cutlass gleams to a fine edge . He puts away the file in his back pocket , and goes up to the corner of the land where the stunted calabash tree never fulfilled its promise . He begins to cut . Here the soil is not hard-packed . He 's facing about four rods of needle grass , not the bamboo grass and sage to follow . We swings the blade , it slices easily , and he swings again . The early tightness across his shoulders disappears as he warms up . He swings , takes a step forward , swings again , and soon the motion is routine . His back and arm stop taking notice . He could travel anywhere in this rhythm . All the way back to Gijon where she told him and he believed that Astrid would one day be a saint . Her life was dedicated , she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve her land . People , pastures , sheep , the oaks and eucalyptus , the silvery streams , serve them and it , when you count the unseen spirit that comes with air , unto her final breath . He must find such a place , she said . He should come to her country and see , then find such a place , she said . And at the station in Gijon they promised to meet again , the deity willing . <p> Then came Fidel . Stirring an over-layered source within , founding the discovery that he need no longer run , bringing him face to face with the need to escape back into the time and place where he belonged . At first , he wanted to go straight from San Sebastian where Astrid did not reappear to Cuba , and started out . Until she came out of a window pane briefly in Irun where he had to switch trains , and in a silent way opened a new key for the traveler  --  Lisbon , Liverpool , Marseilles , Cadiz . Amsterdam , Antwerp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by smell alone but by the rhythm it called out of his feet until he hears Tante Vy say , " Your land now . I old and passing on . I 's your father 's last sister . You the oldest grandchild carrying the name . It leave to you now . Your land . " She was old . She passed on . He was home again . His land now . And Miss May 's boy Rodney who had never left , who had never wished to leave , who was Tante Vy 's house help her last years , intrigued , yes , by the multicolored stamps littering his passport and the photographs of foreign places , content still to say , " I could stay around and show you what to do if you like . " Rodney <p> And after all the talk , what had he given the boy ? What tools ? What knowledge ? No tool , no rule , no law , no thought on the readiness to die and how nothing could be made without it . He had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy one of these mornings . He knows it in his bones and he calls the boy 's name , into the breeze that has lost its freshness , not out of love alone but rancor too that he nor nothing he could do will change that . Deep rancor that in fact nothing he can do will change anything . Yet , there is work . There is this grass , the knee-high weeds to come , and on his way home from the garden a hand or two of plantains for Miss May , and see if there is anything else he could do for her . <p> At the end of the needle grass he stops cutting and wipes his forehead . Then he walks back up hill to the boundary of the land and down the line to his plantain grove . He has not been here since the crop was sold weeks ago , and the grass is up to his waist . He slashes side to side as he enters the grove , then tops the first empty trees . The cutlass slices easily through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground , make it easier for the new shoots to come through . This is not the work he had set himself to do , but since he 's in here he might as well do it . When he comes to a tree that does have a bunch of plantains hanging down the fruit are thick and full enough so their skins are almost white . He takes the bunch , tops and levels the tree , then hoists the bunch across his shoulders down to the ajoupa . There 's enough so he could take three or four hands to Miss May ... <p> And say what to her ? That he 's sorry ? That he never intended things to turn out this way when he told the boy about Cuba ? He , not what he said , is the lesson . His revolution brought him home to the land ... Yes Rodney , I saw Fidel in Santiago . He was standing in the park just like you or me listening to the musicians , and I walk up to him and take his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole world admired what he 'd done and we all wanted to do like him . What 'd he say ? Told me every man must make his own revolution . The big one comes when all the little ones turn out to want the same thing . That was the lesson Miss May . Right there . I did n't mean for Rodney to go off and join no guerrillas in the forest . And I still do n't know if he was serious . <p> I thought he was living nice there in the house with me . I did n't change nothing . He still had his own bed , clothes , plenty to eat , I did n't force him to work in the garden when he did n't want to  --  just like when Tante Vy was alive . I was n't here but he told me himself at times , just like when she was alive . I did n't send him to join no guerrillas I did n't send him .... And when I got there ... when I find their camp , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no idea guerrilla was in any drug business I had no idea police was all in the bush . It was already dark by the time I find them . All we had time for was Rodney coming out when I call , come out their tent and stand up between two mora trees looking like he 's glad to see me , and the shooting start I do n't even know who 's shooting at who but I see the fire and hear shot cutting through the trees , and Rodney bawling Run Run You can blame me ? <p> With one part of his mind he understands everything instantly . He had seen the private Jeep in the clearing . In no time at all it started up and went tearing off back into the woods and he knew right away why somebody was trying to save whatever was in it . Drugs And he had one choice to make , keep running .... In the clearing without trees the moonlight bends softly off the meadow grass , and the first hill makes a round shadow up ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could hear them coming . He must get over the top of the hill and his legs are tight , his gut is burning tight , his chest is tight . He 's angry , and he wants to cry . And if he thinks of it he 's trembling too with fright because they mean to kill if they catch him . <p> In what he thought was shadow from the hill it 's not the hill making shadow at all but a clump of tall bamboo . He drives his legs past this , drives them hard up and over the hill , and tells them to relax going down the other side . He 's hot and frightened but knows it 's better to relax , and he tells his legs and lungs to not work so hard going down . <p> Soon he 'll come to the second hill , up and over , a bend or two , and there will be the main road . He must reach the main road .... <p> He did n't intend anything to turn out this way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy take his own road and it 's better so . Better for them not to be together .... I did n't leave him purposely but it was better for us not to be together , Miss May . It was better . We had a better chance that way . <p> These plantains , they 're not anything . I do n't mean anything by bringing them .... Is that what he 'll say ? Or should he leave the fruit for Miss May quietly and let things rest ? <p> There will be enough for Kate too . He takes a drink of water . Back up at the boundary he begins cutting the waist-high bamboo grass , the mosquito bush and sage . This land , so ready to grow . All you have to do is turn your back on it and every wild bush springs up . <p> He should finish cutting by time the sun says eleven . He will stop then , get a ripe pawpaw and a cane from over near the boundary with Cooper land , and take a rest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high sky says all day will be a bright day today . No rain . The only wet will be the sweat already soaked through the sleeveless jacket and the waistband of his old fatigues . His body water . He is proud of his body . At forty-five his stomach is still flat , and he could go a whole day on a pawpaw and a piece of cane . He could walk to anywhere he had to without joint-pain stiffness His eyes could pick up a needle in the distance . And after all the frightened running from the night before he still held fit enough to work all day . <p> Today he 'll finish cutting the ground , and begin forking the yam banks by the time the sun goes down . Then go home , bathe , and let Kate come to his house if she wants to . She is not Astrid . Kate goes to church even if she 's not a godly woman . She 's kind , and never lets much stand in the way of doing for him . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sage and mosquito bush dulls the blade , and he stops to freshen the edge on his cutlass . <p> The breeze is no longer light and fresh . It blows with the smell of cut grass , and heavier with the coming heat . Across the hill Cooper and his son are in their garden too ; he could hear their voices They 're getting yam banks ready too . And Jaggernaut from the other side . He could hear Jaggernaut talking to his wife behind their stand of figs , making rows for their fine crops . <p> By now Kate 's been a while at the station . She 'll make the bail . The boy will be home , and what shall he say to him when he gets there ? Rodney , before you die ... Rodney ... They will kill you , but put death out of your mind ... Rodney ... <p> He files two chips smooth into the edge of the blade , measures the rest of the work with his eye , then goes on cutting . Swing , half-turn , swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And suddenly Voice drops out of the sky like thunder . Playing deaf Playing you 're deaf with no need to understand Thundering , We 're here to bear witness you know ? We 're here to bring light .

" He could hear his voice going off on the breeze , knowing that Cooper and his son , Jaggernaut and his wife , and anybody working on Headley 's land up the crest of the hill , will hear him talking to himself . But Rodney is like the son he 's never truly had . <p> The son who stayed at home to learn Tante Vy 's business so that by time he 's eighteen he could make the best dew in the village , and show anybody how to make a mix , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ready by timing .

He has wife and child , although they do n't live in the same house and some people 'd say she 's just a girl he take up with . The boy could dance , and he could plant too . Everything his hand touch come up nice . Is n't there a way to save him ? <p> Must be a way . Because , maybe there was a secret intention in telling him about Fidel after all . A secret intention to send him traveling . Send him off to London , Paris , Amsterdam . Gijon . Meaning no disrespect nor hostility for the young wife and child , but send him off to someplace where he 'd encounter his own Astrid .

Even when his senses warn him snake snake after he smells it , he keeps on swinging smoothly , unbroken motion . It is day , today . Bright day . And there must be a way to save Rodney from any gallows in the morning , He sees the brown back slithering away . Brown with the regular black markings . He does not break his pace to chop and kill . His arm is steady in its swing , and he watches the sage , the grass , the bush go down . There must be a way And he vows to himself that one day he would see the boy off to his own faraway places . And hen he hears them . <p> It 's a tramping in the bush , nothing smooth like snake .

He could hear them tramping , getting closer behind , but he is almost over the second hill now . They are close enough behind so he could hear the weight of their footfall , and hears one panting , " Bitch You damn bitch " He wonders why they do n't shoot . He does not dwell on why they do n't shoot , he windmills his legs downhill for the dark shade at the bottom ruts or no ruts . He goes pell-mell through the low brush and the balisier . Underneath the interlaced banyans he 's out of the moonlight now , there 's a curve between him and the killers . They did not shoot . He wonders why they did not shoot . But there 's the main road that he knows well . He turns to his right toward the overgrown cocoa estate . The old drying house is silhouetted in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And at the next curve where half the road is fallen away in a raw landslide he throws himself off into the brush , stops dead still and waits .

He waits , trembling on the inside , until he hears them coming up the road . There are two of them , but then he always knew that . One is fat and limping , he could tell from their footfall .

He could hear them walking away from the landslide back down the curve , their voices carrying in the quiet moonlight as if directly to him , " Bitch " " We gon catch you . Do n't fraid . We gon catch you . " <p> He could hear them going away , he could hear them come back again , and he should run without waiting to see whether they will shoot this time or not . But he does n't feel like running . He does n't feel like doing anything except clearing the ground , getting it ready for his yam banks . <p> Down from the sky it is a bright day , best sort of day for work , and he ready to work all day in the breeze that is hot but carrying very little moisture . He could hear them thrashing through the grass and bush he 's already cut , he does not look their way . He should 've run , but instead his feet have taken root . Just for the test of it he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not far off the ground . They move in no more than the dance he 's been doing all morning long , and with a sneaking joy , as though some inner part of him has received confirmation , he reaches over and swings the blade . <p> He cuts the young bush cleanly and pulls it out of the way with his crook stick . He swings again . The muscles in his back stretch like hard bands through the reach of his arc then pull back , so he can swing again . They are here , he can feel them . But he does not look their way . <p> " Ai You " They are close enough , but he does not look up . Voice in the sky will make an announcement soon , he knows , and he will wait . <p> " Ai , niggah " <p> " Do n't say that " the second one says , swift and cold . " The next time you call somebody that working with me is bullet in yuh ass . Yuh got that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he I calling . " <p> He looks up then . He straightens up and looks at the two of them . <p> Neither one is wearing uniform . The fat one is an Indian standing a few paces in front of Sarge , a brown cloth hat pulled down tightly over his head . His shirt-sleeves are unbuttoned , and he holds the shotgun in both hands across his heavy thighs , finger on the trigger . He is a heavy man with soft breast and a ragged mustache covering all his mouth . He is scowling as much as the fat in his face will let him , but only his eyes look dangerous . Pig eyes . Fixed . Intent . Ready for any motion . " Yes , you " he says through the hairs covering his mouth . <p> " Ask his name , " the next one says . Sarge is a tall black man whose nose has in the past been broken . He is bareheaded , and the flowered cotton shirt outside his blue jeans falls flat against his stomach . He probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a defender on some football team . " Get his name first , " he says . His gun 's a pistol held casually at his side , finger on the trigger . <p> " What yuh name ? " <p> " Who you ? " he replies . " What 're you doing on my land ? " <p> " We do n't care about who land You have a name ? " <p> " Who 're you What yuh want on my land ? " <p> " Police in yuh ass , that 's who . Why allyuh does thief so ? Allyuh telling people allyuh is guerrilla , ai n't nothing but thief . Allyuh know who ground that is you thiefing from ? " <p> We 're here to bear witness . We 're here to receive all our own without pity nor anxiety . Even when time is untimely . We would prefer to see long life for the gifted . Rodney was n't meant only for cricket . The gift of light is in him . So wherever he pass , whatever he touch he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it too . That 's why they kill Rodney one of these mornings . <p> ... Voice in the sky is calmly measured . <p> " You know the one name Rodney ? " Sarge 's voice is calm but he 's not a calm man inside . <p> " What do you want ? " <p> " We is police , yuh bitch " the Indian one screams , flying spittle from between the hairs around his mouth , and the day closes down quietly around his screaming . No more voices from Cooper 's land . <p> Jaggenauth and his wife are silent . Even the parakeets passing overhead , and he could glimpse a small flock of them from the corner of his eye , pass over in silence . <p> " So yuh 's police . What d' you want " I do n't like thief , " the Indian one says . " I have it personal against thief . Talking about land , yuh call this land ? Go in the forest , yuh see land . Plenty land . Yuh know who land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we land . You want to see land ... ? <p> " Indian stop boasting , " Sarge says " This have nothing to do with Indian and how much land they have . You know the boy Rodney ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " What 's your name ? " <p> " You know everything already , you must know that too . " <p> " We want you to say it " the Indian says , charged and vehement . " You have to say your name . " They 're killing Miss May 's boy one of these mornings because , they say , he 's guerrilla making revolution . He 's planning to destroy the government . Planning to assassinate the government . Assassinate this one and that one , and how the country fortunate police discover the guerrilla scheme in time . Discover . That 's what they say . But Rodney never had nothing to hide . The blood flowing in him is not a blood that choose to hide . " What happen , yuh ca n't talk now ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the boy talk dislike for any government , he 's not the only one disliking it . It have family after family who do n't like government but who never take courage to openly talk it , and that is so . " Yuh ' fraid ; yuh ca n't talk ? " If Rodney talk like guerrilla is because he 's picked to talk . The ancestors , when they sit down in banquet and finish their deliberations , they pick him . They say , " That one . " They say so long before he born , and nothing ca n't change that . " Get down on yuh knees " the fat Indian says . <p> So whoever they might be , when they say they hang Rodney to make example they 're lost . They 're wayward , backward , lost and do n't even know they 're in the wilderness . As chaff before a wind . Chaff is what the seed throw off before the wind . <p> " Who land you say in the forest ? " he jabs the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land yuh say that is in the forest ? " he stands straight with his palm over the handle of his cutlass and waits . <p> " That we land , yuh damn thief Allyuh so-call guerrilla coming in there and thiefing crop Allyuh putting up tent in secret and thiefing crop . Allyuh selling marijuana all over the place . Allyuh plant any ? Allyuh know where that seed come from ? " <p> We come out of hallowed ground . We have no tails to tuck between our legs . We are an honorable people . Honor the Ancestors Dance with the one for who you are named . We come from hallowed ground . They should be here to see us hold hands with the mothers of Soweto . They should be on hand to see us conference with the armies of Zimbabwe , the people 's army of Angola , shoulder to shoulder in Argentina , Chile , Manila , Ethiopia . " I thought forest belong to the government . " <p> " Who yuh think is the government ? Yuh ever hear about the Ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clear in middle of the forest and put in seed ? Allyuh enh plant shit Allyuh enh know where shit come from But allyuh selling . Everywhere allyuh selling marijuana , telling people buy to support your liberation cause . Is allyuh the Venezuelan patrol does be shooting at when time come to bring seed from The Main ... ? " They 're lost . They rush to make a time of sorrow and do not know it . They are lost , in a delusion . Embrace the Ancestors Keep steady on your way , there are no barracks here . <p> " Indian , " Sarge calls in his low voice . " Indian . " <p> " Yuh know how much ah we dead in the water bringing in that seed ? Yuh know how much ah we work we tail morning to night clearing the forest to plant seed ? " <p> " Indian " <p> " Yuh know who break ground , and plant seed , and bring crop in there ? And allyuh playing guerrilla coming in and thiefing what ai n't yours to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ... " <p> " Indian " Sarge 's voice does n't come from the same man who was talking before . He is the same man to look at , but deeper in the ground , taller to the sky . The Indian stops . His voice dries up and he lets his head drop to look down at the weapon in his hands . " You do n't need to say all that , " Sarge says , and then shifts attention to him . " When police ask you a question you 're supposed to answer . Not talk back . I'ma ask you now , what 's your name ? " <p> Who are these men ? What are they after Madrid , Paris , Baltimore ? Who are these men ? Have they seen the great shuttling of trains at Irun ? Have they walked the plains of Texas ? For the fat Indian he feels nothing . For the tall hard one who could be a distant cousin to him , does he have a son ? " What gon happen to the boy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , what gon happen to the boy ? " <p> " I do n't like thief , " the Indian says , his head still hung , looking at the ground . <p> " You 're going to state your name ? " Sarge loosens his arm dangling the pistol . The mindless ones say we do n't have heritage . Know the ancestors are never far , the journey unending . We did not ask for this given , this challenge facing blood against time . We 're not the first , we 're not the last .... <p> " I ca n't stand thief , " the Indian says , suddenly raising his head and screaming , " Say you 're sorry Get down on your damn knees and say you 're sorry .... " <p> " I have nothing to sorry for . I 'm not a thief , nor no guerrilla neither . " <p> " Then what you doing there Sarge says . " How come you 're here in the forest if you 're not guerrilla ? " <p> " I went just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he call himself guerrilla is because he do n't know a better name for what it is he want to do . " " Down " the Indian says , turning his weapon to point down at the ground . " Down on your knees and say you 're sorry . " <p> He does not move . He speaks . The blood rush that had filled his head subsides , his head is clear . " I 've been many places in this world , " he says , " and most of them have people quick to join in making sorrow ..... " <p> " You might as well get down if you want a chance , " Sarge says . <p> " Right down here , down this hill where I cross every morning there 's the river where the church does have baptism .... " <p> The exploding blast , comes same time with the pain and changes the taste in his mouth . He feels a great sucking emptiness where his left side should be . He would like to continue speaking , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deeper into the darkness . <p>
