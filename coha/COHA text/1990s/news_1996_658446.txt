<p> While most viewers will be wowed by stunning athletic performers at the Olympics , what they may not notice is the high-powered technological act bringing the Games to their living rooms . <p> From Olympic sites on the Internet to venue security , the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games ( ACOG ) and a band of high-powered technology sponsors have built what is being billed as the most accessible and efficient Olympic games in history . <p> Indeed , the 1996 Games are the most high-tech yet , changing the way people view the Olympics and the way the Games are run . <p> For 2 million spectators and an estimated 3 billion viewers who want up-to-the-minute results as well as background , context , and color - beyond what they get from announcers - the Internet can serve as their virtual ticket and data base . <p> Information relay-ricochet <p> This year marks the debut of cyberspace 's take on the Olympics . The first " official " Olympic Games Home Page on the World Wide Web ( http : **25;258;TOOLONG ) was created by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they expect some 250,000 virtual visitors per day once the Centennial Games start Friday . These other Web pages with Olympic information add to the offerings : <p> *NBC - <p> http : //www.olympic.nbc.com <p> *AT &T; - <p> http : //www.olympic.att.com <p> *The Atlanta Journal-Constitution - http : //www.atlantagames.com . <p> Within the Olympic village , some 150,000 athletes , coaches , family members , officials , media employees , volunteers , contractors , and staff will have access to information at kiosks - from " Who 's leading the men 's platform diving after the fourth round ? " to " How do I get to Peachtree Plaza ? " <p> The amount of data disseminated by the IBM-ACOG project alone ( 3 terabytes , to be exact ) would fill a daily newspaper every day for 10,000 years . <p> Highlights of the framework include : <p> *The results system , which provides instant confirmation of winners . This system was designed to manage results of the 271 medal events and to transfer the data - in less than one second - to judges , scoreboards , media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldwide via the Web . So when a swimmer hits the touchpad , it 's a done deal ( although judges and referees have the power to delay the electronic transfer ) . IBM worked with Swatch Timing to integrate systems . Also , the Games ' 40,000 volunteers will use pen-based notebook computers to keep track of play-by-play sports action , such as recording an assisted goal in soccer . <p> *The commentator information system . With 31 venues hosting competitions of 37 sports disciplines , how 's a sportscaster to keep track ? This system helps put scores , statistics , background , and more at announcers ' fingertips . While a version of this was used in the Barcelona and Lillehammer Olympics , it 's been revamped to make things even easier for sportscasters . For example , the " touch-screen " resembles a reporter 's notebook and has tabbed sections . So if , for example , an " unknown " takes the gold in the 400-meter run , a reporter could quickly access that runner 's biography for some background . <p> *The info ' 96 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast ? This encyclopedia-like system is designed for athletes , coaches , volunteers , and media members attending the Games . Some 1,800 touch-screen kiosks will be set up in the Olympic village to provide event schedules , results , biographies , historical data , and even weather forecasts . E-mail and an electronic bulletin board will allow athletes and other users to communicate with one another ( in English or French ) as well as keep in touch with family members at the Games and back home . Info ' 96 also contains 100 years of Olympic history and reams of other information . <p> *1996 Centennial Olympic Games Web server . This will make the ' 96 Olympics the most accessible Games to fans ever . You can buy tickets through the home page , but if you plan to stay home , this site - along with your TV - will be the next best thing to being there . " We like to think of people in front of their TVs with a laptop on their lap , " says Maria Battaglia , IBM 's communications manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , technology also helps officials manage the Games . Again , the amount of data being distributed will be staggering : Information from scoring and timing systems will be fed into systems which will distribute it to the media . And the video feed must be transferred to the networks . <p> Backup plans need to be in place " just in case . " Officials need instant communication . And security must run a tight ship . Even weather and traffic advisories need to be accessible . <p> One of the most talked-about news-gathering tools is a system called SCARLET - Synchronous Communications Accessing Real-time Live Event Television . SCARLET will enable reporters , officials , and others to keep up with events by choosing up to 60 channels of video . They will also be able to get up-to-the-second results for these events along with schedules and other information . The project is a collaboration of BellSouth ( which provides the fiber-optic distribution network ) , Scientific-Atlanta ( electronics ) , and Panasonic ( video cameras and displays in the Olympic Village and ACOG Operations Center ) . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team statistics , start lists , and heat lists will come from Xerox . <p> Motorists in Atlanta will have up-to-the-minute information on what 's happening on roadways from computerized kiosks , electronic signs , and radio reports . Hundreds of video cameras and speed detectors will monitor roads and feed information to media and emergency officials , and directly to in-car navigation systems . If an accident occurs they will be able to act quickly , dispatching emergency crews and redirecting motorists . <p> Games security <p> In addition , security personnel will oversee two new electronic screening devices . Sensormatic 's Hand-Geometry Reader will take the measurements of an individual 's hand and match them with an identity . A Sensor ID card , issued to accredited participants , has a computer chip that will be read by monitors at entrances . An IBM system will also orchestrate Olympic security systems with those of state and local officials . It will monitor alarms and entries , and allow enforcement officials to troubleshoot and track patterns . <p> ' Hello , Mom ? I got second ! ' <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been easier . <p> Pagers , voicemail with interpreter services ( in 140 languages available 24 hours a day ) , E-mail , fax services , and desktop video will allow participants to communicate with other athletes , their coaches , and family back home . ( AT &T,; and its spin-off , Lucent Technologies , is providing telecommunications services . ) <p> With such a large-scale , data-heavy international event like the Olympics , back-up systems and recovery plans are paramount . <p> " Whatever small glitches occur , we expect they will not be apparent to the public , and they 'll be fixed immediately , " says IBM 's Battaglia . " Overall , " she adds , " we should get a 10 .
