Let 's take a sports quiz . When do kickoffs happen in football ? Answer : when the two-minute TV commercial break is over . Why are World Series games played on frigid October nights and on the West Coast in late-afternoon twilight ? So viewers at home can watch in prime time . Why do basketball play-offs now include 16 of the N.B.A. 's 27 teams and last well into June , when the heat in old arenas like the Boston Garden can be stifling ? Right again : so TV can have more potentially high-rated games . And if television did n't exactly create showboating antics like slam dunks in basketball and end-zone dances in football  --  well , what better way to make the evening 's sports-highlight reel ? <P> So it goes in the high-stakes marriage between television and sports . It did not take long for these two great American institutions to meet and tie the knot . But only recently did they fully realize how much they mean to each other . For the networks , sports programming is a surefire audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , TV is the irresistible avenue to mass-audience popularity  --  and almost unimaginable riches . <P> But the marriage entails a kind of Faustian bargain . Any league that wants to pry big bucks from TV 's big spenders must , to one degree or another , adapt to the needs of the tube . That can mean anything from inserting commercial time-outs to overhauling the season schedule . As the money keeps growing , so does TV 's determination to get the most from its investment by orchestrating the show for maximum viewer appeal . The medium that once simply covered America 's favorite sports has virtually taken them over . <P> And boy , have the bucks grown . The National Football League 's new pact , approved a week ago , is a stunner even by the rapidly inflating standards of the medium : $3.6 billion , divvied up among five broadcast and cable networks , to bring every touchdown pass and holding penalty into American homes for the next four years . It is the biggest TV sports deal ever negotiated . <P> To justify those billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starting next season , pro football will add two more teams to the play-offs and , by the fall of 1992 , two more weeks to the season . That will probably push the Super Bowl into February , which just happens to be a ratings " sweeps " period . And for fans who had too much Bud Bowl and not enough Super Bowl last January , relief is nowhere in sight . To help defray the immense cost of football 's telecast rights , the networks will add three more 30-second commercial spots to each game next season , and another two in the fall of 1992.
