<p> Classics : pearls , bread pudding , khaki pants , chocolate-frosted brownies , Tinkertoys , tulips and coffeecakes . <p> Classics are enduring and in good taste . <p> Classic desserts taste good , often in a way that satisfies not only a craving for something sweet , but also a yearning for childhood 's simple comfort foods . <p> Marietta Chmelar and her partner , Jean Haratford , understand what a classic dessert is . And that 's what they named their year-old business . <p> " Classic desserts are made from scratch using fine ingredients . Having classic desserts means developing recipes using seasonal ingredients , " Chmelar said . <p> Trays of frosted chocolate brownies , lemon bars , coffeecake , oversized cookies and pound cakes line the cases of the attractive shop at 2921 N. Sheffield . There are extravagant frosted layer cakes and the architecturally designed special-occasion cakes that Classic Desserts is developing a reputation for . <p> Chmelar and Haratford are fulfilling longtime fantasies . <p> " I always wanted to have a bakery , " said Haratford , who formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several years ago , she made the switch . After taking a pastry course at Kendall College in Evanston , she worked in the Evanston Foodstuffs pastry department , at the Midland Hotel in the Loop and at the Sweet Mysteries bakery at 3335 N. Southport . <p> Chmelar was in foodservice at Carson Pirie Scott for years before she honed her baking skills . <p> Then one day almost two years ago , when the women were working together at Sweet Mysteries , Haratford announced that she wanted her own bakery . Spontaneously , Chmelar offered to go into business with her . Their spouses were not only supportive , but helpful as well . Haratford 's husband installed counters and Chmelar 's husband painted the walls . <p> Both women , who have grown children , commented that they could n't have spent the time required to launch a bakery when their children were young . <p> Nine months after the inspiration , Classic Desserts was born . <p> " Some things have surprised us ( in the first year of business ) , " Haratford said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell it by the piece , with a container of sauce . They want to know what style bread pudding it is : Is it like their grandmother 's , or is it New Orleans style ( which usually has brandy , whiskey or bourbon ) . " <p> She makes one or two yeast breads every day on a rotating schedule . Her leftover French bread is the base for the bread pudding , although it 's in such demand that she often bakes bread just for that recipe . <p> " And brownies . We ca n't make enough of them , " said Chmelar . <p> " We created the brownie when someone asked for chocolate cake with a brownie layer topped with fudge and a cake layer . We had leftover brownies from that baking experience , so we frosted them and put them out . People loved them , " Haratford said . <p> Unlike traditional bakeries that sell whole items , such as cakes and trays of brownies , many of Classic Desserts ' baked goods are sold by the piece . That also surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose a taste of everything rather than limit themselves to one selection . <p> Some of the bakery 's best desserts are spontaneous . <p> " What 's fun about having our own place is that we can look in the cooler and see what we can do with what we have . For example , one week we had a lot of oranges and decided on an orange coffeecake , " Chmelar said . <p> Their poppy-seed pound cake resulted from a customer request . And their hazelnut biscotti , which combine the sweet , buttery taste of hazelnuts with a generous bite of black pepper , are based on numerous experiments . <p> " When we look for ideas , we think of the season  --  what people are interested in eating , what magazines and cookbooks are featuring , " Haratford said . " Sometimes things work ; sometimes they do n't . " <p> Autumn through Christmas is the bakers ' favorite time . It means spicy cakes , piles of cookies and as many chocolate pastries as the two can make . <p> With the recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chmelar shared with the Sun-Times their recipes for hazelnut-black pepper biscotti , orange streusel coffeecake and poppy-seed pound cake . <p> It 's important to not overbeat the coffeecake batter . Treat it like muffin batter , stirring gently and briefly . The pound cake is sold plain at Classic Desserts , but the recipe 's cream cheese frosting is an excellent addition . <p> HAZELNUT-BLACK PEPPER BISCOTTI <p> 1 3/4 cups flour <p> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda <p> 1/2 teaspoon baking powder <p> 1/8 teaspoon salt <p> 2 teaspoons medium-grind black pepper , or to taste <p> 1/2 cup ( 1 stick ) butter , at room temperature <p> 1 cup sugar <p> 2 eggs <p> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract <p> 2 cups chopped toasted hazelnuts <p> Combine flour , baking soda , baking powder , salt and pepper ; set aside . <p> With an electric mixer , beat butter and sugar for 3 minutes .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient remains with others that were more obscure was meant to appeal especially to connoisseurs ( literally , " people in the know " ) . It both tested these viewers ' knowledge and teased their expectations , forcing them to recognize what was documentary and what was imagined . Disparate pieces reassembled in a new context also created new meanings and commentary on cultural or societal decline or entropy . Ruins in contemporary paintings can still evoke similar sentiments , and it is also true that by projecting the modem world into the future , imaginary ruins allow us to meditate on the fate of our familiar world . WHY PAINT A CAPRICCIO TODAY ? So , why should an accomplished plein air artist today try the studio capriccio ? Part of the reason is practi- cal : Composing a successful capriccio hones a painter 's skills in composition , since the capriccio depends on mastery of classical composi- tional devices to create its aura of credibility . If the measure of a plein air paint- ing is how much it captures the truthful nature of its sub- ject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the realist : Inventing a reality that is at once fantas- tic and yet believable is chal- lenging and requires differ- ent skills . However , there is a deeper reason to recover the capriccio tradition along with the genre of plein air . Many of the artists who painted the most compelling on-site paintings - I 'm thinking of Hubert Robert or ClaudeJoseph Vernet , and later Corot and Thomas Cole - saw their field studies as preparatory for not just a bigger studio version of the same scene , but something more spectacular than reality . Paradoxical as it seems to us , who appreciate so much the honest representation of the real , many of the greatest landscape painters of the past were expert fabricators of views ; this made them highly attuned to the compositional potential in a scene and skilled at pulling out of reality its most dramatic qualities . Being an architect mostly directs me to plein air subjects that juxtapose the natural and the manmade . For me , this kind of open-air subject is naturally related to the capriccio , and seeking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an exciting window into a lost tradition , just as landscape sketches by such great masters as Corot have excited a rebirth of the plein air genre . Although there are precious few of us willing to take the leap , diving into the world of altered reality is @x Renaissance artists ' constant reference to what they called disegno ( which involved both drawing and design ) underpinned every one of their creations ; in other words , they carefully thought through their work on paper before committing to the final product . Drawing was the common foundation for both art and architecture , and documenting buildings in the landscape was a common practice for both painters and architects in the Renaissance and well after . Therefore , if we want to understand the classical view of the landscape , if s important to see it in relationship to buildings . This means both painting en plein air and recovering its lost parallel , the capriccio , or " invented landscape . " In the last several years I 've developed a passion for painting en plein air that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome , Frank Montana , and has been reinvigorated by working in oil with artist and teacher John Smalley in England . I try to respect the tradition implied by this appropriately French phrase , working directly from the subject outdoors in a restricted amount of time of no more than two hours . Plein air done this way has something of sport about it , a wrestling match with the subject where one races the clock ( actually , the sun ) to capture the critical characteristics of a subject , making a small just as venerable , and just as much fun , as wrestling with a subject in the open air . So much so , in fact , that I believe it deserves its own renaissance .                     canvas that is not only recognizable but also memorable . The choice of subject matter , or the composition of a scene , are what tie working in the field to inventing landscapes in the studio . To master this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design and drawing , and the capriccio is an excellent exercise to hone these skills . PLEIN AIR AND THE CLASSICAL TRADITION We should first recognize that plein air painting was not always held in high regard in the classical tradition . Even painters of grand formal views produced in the studio were placed lower on the ladder of the hierarchy of the arts than what used to be called history painting , or the " Grand Manner . " The great view painter Canaletto himself was only admitted to the Venetian artists ' academy just before the end of his life , and then grudgingly . If artists of history painting , such as Poussin or Tiepolo , indulged in sketching outdoors , it was either for their own amusement or to search out motifs for grander works . That , then , was often the role of the sketch in wash or oil done on-site well into the 18th century , to serve as research for imminent or eventual canvases that required credible landscape contexts . Of course , there were those operating simultaneously with Poussin or Tiepolo whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sake : Claude Lorrain in the former era , or the aforementioned Canaletto , and Francesco Guardi in the latter . But these artists would never have deemed " finished " a work they had executed in front of a scene in a couple of hours - not because of the speed , but because no real subject , no matter how compelling , was perceived to be as noble as the image transformed or invented by an artist of sound judgment . The imperfect real world captured in a fleeting moment , with all it implied about compression in size and editing of detail , could never match what one could achieve in a controlled physical and intellectual environment . The dashed-off work had its aficionados , but for artists who had a hard enough time earning credibility and money for their underappreciated vedute , the 18th-century plein air sketch could never be more than a private pleasure . It was with the advent of realism in the latter 18th century and especially 19th century that the plein air " snapshot " acquired value for its own sake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the i8th century only slightly lagged behind the development of a seemingly contrary genre , the capriccio ( literally a " caprice " ) . Like its musical counterpart , the capriccio implied something seemingly effortlessly dashed off , and yet in both music and art it usually involved instead careful planning and a deep understanding of its more classical alternatives . A capriccio in painting usually meant an invented view , a landscape often of magnificent ruins composed of recognizable parts in unrecognizable juxtapositions . The classic plein air painter sought out subjects and framed his or her views with an eye to a compelling image . The artists of capricci , meanwhile , sought maximum drama in staging views often inspired by 18th-century stage set designs . These were fantastic landscapes that often transformed real places into something more spectacular . If the capriccio was often capricious , it did not deny the classical approach to composition . On the contrary , the capriccio depended even more on the " stagy " quality of the standard foreground/middle ground/background structure that artists of landscape had employed since the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , a set designer - painted his capricci in England , for example , he juxtaposed an impossible assortment of monuments , but the structure of the compositions respected a clear focus on the middle ground . The principles of landscape composition depended on the tried-and-true structure of foreground as frame : often with the requisite repoussoir tree trunk or temple ruin leading the viewer 's gaze into the picture ; the middle ground serving as primary focus or destination of the view ; and the background suggesting distance . If the capriccio respected and even depended on this structure , it tended to exaggerate its effects , the foreground being filled sometimes with impossibly large fragments ( as in Piranesfs frontispieces ) swathed in shade , the middle ground grand and at times out of scale , and the background wispily far away . The capriccio , in essence , depended on drama and hyperbole to create a sense of both believability and sublime impossibility . RUINS AND THE CAPRICCIO Capriccio landscapes created their aura of the spectacular and the sublime in part by introducing something unfamiliar in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unfamiliar place . Hubert Robert in particular developed numerous compositions of this kind that rearranged the landscape of Rome and Lazio into compellirigly familiar , if unreal , worlds . Often these versions of Rome were created when he was back in Paris , and his ability to compose out of such fragments even led him to work as a designer of gardens and follies . Exaggerations of scale , emphasizing the remarkable achievements of the ancients , were often a corollary to this approach , again lending an air of drama to otherwise static images . As stage sets , capricci developed from the calculated views of the two-point perspective scenes known as scena per angoh ( scenery at an
