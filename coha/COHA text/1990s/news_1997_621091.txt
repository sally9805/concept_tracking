<p> After a year of seemingly random digging and welding at San Francisco International Airport , SFO 's 21st century face is finally taking shape . <p> The massive construction project  --  which has made the airport look as if giant kids had scattered their Legos across a vast playground  --  has progressed to the point where visitors can make some sense out of the $ 2.4 billion face-lift , centered around a huge new international terminal made of aluminum , glass and steel . <p> By the time the project is completed early in the next century , SFO will be transformed in ways that will affect every passenger , airline worker and visitor . <p> At its heart will be the looming overseas terminal  --  the size of 18 football fields  --  which will house 24 to 26 new gates , each capable of handling wide-bodied jets full of foreign tourists and business people who are playing an increasingly vital role in the expanding Bay Area economy . <p> The airport will also have its own light-rail system , projected to be linked to the long-debated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within 75 yards of the new terminal . <p> The aim of all this construction and disruption is to turn SFO  --  already a bustling mini-city with a daytime population of 175,000  --  into an even bigger , busier and more profitable transit center . <p> " This is really a city unto itself , " SFO Director John Martin said , as he gazed out at the 2,400-acre airport from its main control tower . " There 's nothing close ( to this project ) in the United States when it comes to size . " <p> The project , the biggest airport expansion underway in the country , has also been undertaken with an eye to the competition . When it 's finished , SFO  --  already the eighth- busiest airport in the world  --  will become an even bigger and more important Pacific Rim port , rivaling Los Angeles International Airport . <p> " On the West Coast , we 're really getting the jump , " Martin said . <p> About 40 million passengers are expected to arrive at and depart from SFO this year . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 11 million . Much of that increase is expected to come from flights to and from Asia . <p> That prospective increase in the already booming Asia market explains why the airport decided to build a new international terminal and make it its centerpiece for decades to come . <p> The expansion , the product of years of planning , was spurred by a simple fact : Business is so good at SFO that the current airport is bursting at the seams . <p> " Having done business in Asia and having had to adjust my schedule to go there because I could n't get a flight , I understand that there is a desperate need to expand the airport , especially in order to serve travelers to the Pacific Rim , " said Dan Richard , a BART director who has been a driving force behind the BART extension plan . <p> " It will benefit the Bay Area in terms of commerce , travel and cultural design , " he added . <p> SFO is already one of the Bay Area 's most profitable establishments . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked airport director Martin , pointing to a small See 's Candies cart in the lobby of the terminal shared by United and American airlines . <p> The answer : a staggering $ 1.4 million , 20 percent of which goes to SFO 's coffers . <p> A Pasqua Coffee cart near the United gates grosses $ 1.3 million annually , and five shoe shine operations rake in a total of about $ 140,000 a year , Martin said . <p> Foreign travelers spend by far the most at the airport , and that 's why Martin wants to expand duty-free shipping space in the new terminal . <p> Data collected by tourism organizations show that visitors from Japan spend an average of about $ 180 at SFO , Martin said . For Koreans , the figure is $ 67 . Armed with such figures , airport planners decided to give foreign tourists more opportunity to spend their money there . <p> When completed , the new terminal will contain 140,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space  --  boosting SFO 's already bursting concessions revenue . <p> Lisbet Engberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , estimated that the airport nets $ 20.9 million from duty-free shops at the existing international terminal . In the new one , she expects that figure to soar to $ 45 million by 2005 . <p> In all , SFO contributes about $ 20 million a year to San Francisco 's general fund , the biggest contribution by any U.S. airport to its host city . A distant second is New York 's Kennedy International Airport , which pitches in $ 8.5 million to the Big Apple 's coffers . A new and bigger SFO is expected to contribute about $ 30 million by 2001 , Martin said . <p> If Martin at times sounds more like a shopping center developer than an aviation planner , that 's because the role of airports is changing as more people travel by air . " Airports are no longer just public utilities , " said Engberg . " They 're businesses , and successful ones at that . " <p> The airport is such a money-spinning operation that the entire $ 2.4 billion project is being covered by lease-revenue bonds , financed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The airport community itself is also expected to grow . About 17,000 people already work at SFO , and the facility spends about $ 21 million a year on water and power . <p> The expansion has created jobs for 3,500 construction workers , and by the time it 's done , according to Martin , the airport 's regular workforce is expected to reach 31,000 . <p> For visitors to SFO , the most dramatic phase of the expansion is just beginning , as crews start laying steel across the airport 's main road to form the base for the upper floors of the terminal . <p> Later this year , 180-foot-long , 270- ton sections of the trusses for the center portion of the wing-like roof will be carried on barges from Mare Island , where they are being welded together . The sections will be placed on wheels and brought to the airport at night . They will then be dragged across taxiways to the construction site , where engineers hope to install them without any major traffic disruptions . <p> The new terminal will be attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international terminal will have 2 million square feet of space , which equals the size of all of SFO 's current terminals . <p> One thing that has made SFO 's situation especially challenging is that the 2,400-acre airport is physically one of the smallest major airports in the country and that further land acquisitions , or reclamation of land from the bay , are all but impossible . <p> The solution was to build upward , abandoning the traditional two-story airport terminal . It will be the " first vertical airport in the world , " said Martin . <p> The 705-foot-long structure will cross the roadway used by motorists as they drive up to the airport 's main loop or head to the main short-term parking garage . The terminal 's design  --  light , airy and with a steel- trussed , gently rolling roof  --  is designed to be welcoming and yet offer a feeling of solidity and strength . <p> " The terminal is a symbol of the airport as the gateway to Asia , and it is also the airport 's new front door , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merrill , one of three firms in design partnership for the building . <p> " We hope it will be a recognizable image for the airport , one that people will remember , " he added . <p> The new terminal 's design has already won praise from local urban planners . <p> Jim Chappell , president of the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association , a civic planning organization , was particularly impressed with the structure 's spaciousness . <p> " The design is fabulous , " he said . " The soaring roof is symbolic of airline flight , of birds ' wings , of openness , of movement and travel and a sense of entry into our city . " <p> The front of the terminal will be a curtain of glass and aluminum . No one will doubt where they are  --  the words " San Francisco International Airport " will be etched in the glass , in back-lit nine-foot-high letters . <p> Departing passengers , whether arriving by BART , shuttles , taxis or private cars , will enter the terminal on the third level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will separate traffic from the existing domestic terminals and carry vehicles to the elevated levels . <p> Unlike the current SFO terminals , where each airline maintains separate ticketing counters , the new one will have airlines sharing six big ticketing islands . <p> A vast concession area  --  many times larger than the 8,000 square feet in the current international terminal  --  will be on the same level , and will offer views of landings and takeoffs . <p> Arrivals will be on the second level , where a high-tech baggage claim system will be installed . Boswell promised that the system is based on tried-and-true technology and will avoid the snafus that dogged the ill-fated baggage system at Denver 's new airport . <p> The new baggage claim system and the area devoted to clearing U.S. customs and passport checks were designed to handle the enormous crowds that descend upon the current terminal between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. , when most flights from the Asia-Pacific region arrive at SFO . That daily torrent of arrivals is repeated in a ritual in the early afternoon , when flights arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our goal is to get people who arrive on international flights out of the terminal in 30 to 40 minutes , " said Dan d'Innocenti , an SFO duty manager . " That works most of the time . But delays can occur when we get five 747s landing at one time . But that 's often something out of our control . " <p> At the new terminal , the goal will be to move people through even faster . <p> " Our biggest challenge was designing a building that is easy to come into , easy to find the key points in and then move through efficiently , " Boswell said . <p> In order to use the new terminal 's Airport Rapid Transit ( ART ) system , travelers will have to take escalators or elevators to the fourth level . ART will carry passengers , for free , to all terminals , and beyond to the new car-rental facility , the adjoining long-term parking lot and even on to the United Airlines maintenance facility at the airport 's northern tip . <p> Two new parking garages with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buses that now jam terminal curbs at SFO  --  the world 's third-largest auto rental market  --  will be gone . Instead , travelers will ride the ART system to a multistory facility housing the rental companies ' fleets . <p> The airport expansion has proceeded with little controversy , except for two aspects . <p> The nine-station , 3.8-mile-long ART system was expected to be under construction by now , but SFO was forced to reopen bids on a $ 137 million contract to install the system after the original winning bidder  --  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Inc.  --  was found not to be in compliance with the city 's affirmative action regulations . <p> That ruling came after the losing bidder , ADtranz , sued . Its bid was $ 19 million higher . New bids were opened last week , and this time ADtranz 's bid was lower than Mitsubishi 's . The city is now reviewing the bids and a final decision on awarding the project could be made by October . It is now hoped that the system will be up and running by the fall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SFO has gone on much longer and involved much higher stakes . It pitted advocates of extending the Bay Area 's rapid transit system against those who said it would be far cheaper to expand Caltrain 's operations to serve the airport . <p> Supporters of the BART plan prevailed , although it was n't until this summer that President Clinton finally committed federal funds to pay for the extension . The first contracts on the SFO end of the BART line are being let now , Martin said , and work should begin by autumn . <p> But given the vast scope of the work , there is a great deal of skepticism concerning whether the projected opening date of the year 2000 can be met . <p> SFO officials , however , definitely plan to have the new terminal in operation by then  --  and many civic leaders are already excited about what they expect will become one of the Bay Area 's exceptional landmarks . <p> " It 's going to be one of the great buildings of our time , " Chappell said .
