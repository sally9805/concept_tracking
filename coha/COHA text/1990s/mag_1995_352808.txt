The best new museum building America has seen in years opened last week in San Francisco , amid relentless social fanfare : the city 's much awaited-and badly needed-Museum of Modern Art . Since 1935 , Bay Area art lovers have had to content themselves with the old SFMOMA , a makeshift affair housed in the Beaux Arts-style War Veterans ' Memorial Building and so cramped that the permanent collection had to be taken down whenever a temporary show went up . In 1990 designs for a new building were made public . It would cost $60 million , all in private money , and the architect was an Italian-Swiss little known in America : Mario Botta . <P> Botta , 51 , deserves all praise for coming up with a design that is n't disfigured by post-Modernist hokiness , as is the 1991 Seattle Art Museum , designed by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown . No smirking little " references " to grand architecture done in pasteboard ; no one-shot ironies or graphic-design quips . Botta 's brick masses occupy their site with authority and dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It might have looked like an art bunker , but Botta avoided this by splitting the mass symmetrically with a protruding skylight : a big cylinder sliced off at a steep angle and faced in bands of dark and white granite . <P> It 's a serious building-a bit pretentious here and there , but with a sure grasp of primary form , sympathetic display spaces and refined detailing . It sets a benchmark for public architecture in San Francisco , a city that has been notoriously ill served by architects over the past quarter-century . <P> But still , there are quibbles . Why a whole ground floor without any place to hang a picture or put a sculpture ? Of course , museums think they have to sell tons of souvenirs , T shirts , replicas and cultural-tourist boutique stuff ; it 's like the religious-kitsch racket in Lourdes or Jerusalem . The entrance foyer duly gives onto the shop and a meeting room and a children 's art studio and a conference theater ; the architect calls the foyer an internal piazza , but its main use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , the giant glass hangar containing the Met 's Temple of Dendur has devolved into the only post-Ptolemaic discotheque in the world . <P> The entrance floor aims to give the visitor a coup de theatre , and it does . After a low entranceway the space soars , thanks to a circular well that rises clear through the building and finishes in the slanting oculus 130 ft. above . It transmits enough light down through the building for Botta to use a dramatic chiaroscuro of materials without sinking the interior in gloom-a striped floor of black and gray granite , for example .
