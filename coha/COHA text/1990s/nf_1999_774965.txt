Through The Prism of the First Three Years // 0ne afternoon in early fall of 1996 , the phone on my desk rang . The call was from a journalist who was writing an article for a national parenting magazine . She was doing a story for her readers based on the then recently released Carnegie Corporation report Years of Promise . She told me that I was on the media list for the report - a list of interested or knowledgeable people , sent out in the report 's press kit , who would be willing to speak to journalists . My name appeared on the list because for the previous decade I had been funding and writing about applications of modern psychology to education and school reform . // She asked me , " Based on neuroscience , what can we tell parents about choosing a preschool for their children ? " When I answered , " Based on neuroscience , absolutely nothing , " I heard a gasp on the other end of the line . The journalist politely suggested that I must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She told me that there was a wealth of new neuroscience out there that suggested otherwise . // I did not think I had been living under a rock . And I did not offer my answer casually . For the four previous years , along with almost everyone else , I had been hearing murmurs about how new breakthroughs in neuroscience - our new , emerging understanding of how the brain worked and developed - were about to revolutionize how we think about children , childcare , and parenting . I had read the occasional articles , features , and editorials that had been published in major American newspapers . The headlines did get one 's attention : " To Shape a Life , We Must Begin Before a Child is 3 , " " Building a Better Brain : A Child 's First Three Years Provide Parents Once-in-Lifetime Opportunity to Dramatically Increase Intelligence , " and " Youngest Kids Need Help , U.S. Told : Federal Government Urged to Focus on Their 1st Three Years . " The articles under the headlines said that new brain research could now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our children . The first three years - the years from birth to 3 - we were told , are the critical years for building better brains . // In early 1996 , I read Sharon Begley 's February 19 Newsweek article , " Your Child 's Brain . " Although I was glad to see that brain science was getting cover-story attention , some of the claims and statements in the article , especially those offered by childcare advocates who were not brain scientists , seemed farfetched . But that is not unusual in popular articles about science and research . // In spring 1996 , because I was on the media list , I saw an advance copy of the aforementioned Carnegie Corporation report , Years of Promise , which briefly touched on what the new brain science might mean for educational practice . The report 's discussion of the brain science was so fleeting that I dismissed the neuroscience as rhetorical window dressing to increase interest in educational policy and reform . About that time , during a visit to the MacArthur Foundation , I read an editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Birth for the Poor . " In this piece , as in others I was now collecting in my file cabinet , the writer claimed that applying the new brain science offered " the quickest , kindest , most promising way to break " the cycle of poverty and ignorance among the nation 's poor and to " raise the IQs of low-scoring children ( who are disproportionately black ) .... " // However , the more I read , the more puzzled I became . For the previous eighteen years , at three private foundations , I had been following research and awarding grants in education , cognitive psychology , and neuroscience . All during that time , I was wondering when I would begin to see credible research that linked brain science with problems and issues in child development and education . I was puzzled because , despite what the headlines proclaimed and the articles stated , I had not yet seen any such research . // In late spring 1996 , I had received an invitation to attend a July workshop in Denver , Colorado , sponsored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Dana Foundation . The workshop 's title was " Bridging the Gap Between Neuroscience and Education . " Based on the reputations of the sponsoring organizations , I thought that the workshop would offer an ideal opportunity for me to learn about the new brain research and its implications . Unfortunately , I had a scheduling conflict and could not go , but my colleague , Dr. Susan Fitzpatrick , a neuroscientist , attended in my place . // When she returned from Denver and briefed me about the meeting , I had expected to hear about new research linking brain development , child development , and education . Instead , she began her briefing with a one-word description of the workshop : " Bizarre . " She told me , and my subsequent reading of the workshop report confirmed , that there was little neuroscience presented in Denver and certainly none that I had not previously known about . There were , however , Susan told me , wide-ranging policy discussions , bordering on the nonsensical , in which early childhood advocates appealed to what might be most charitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support their favorite policy recommendations . Reflecting on the Denver meeting and its report , it seemed as if there was , in fact , no new brain science involved in the policy and media discussions of child development . What seemed to be happening was that selected pieces of rather old brain science were being used , and often misinterpreted , to support preexisting views about child development and early childhood policy . // Thus , my response to the journalist 's call reflected my conviction , based on what I had read and heard up to that point , that there was no new brain science that could tell parents anything about choosing a preschool . Her call , however , did change how I thought about the issue . If claims about brain science were confined to rhetorical flourishes in policy documents like Years of Promise or to the editorial page of the Chicago Tribune , it was probably relatively harmless . It might even draw attention to some important issues that policymakers and newspaper readers might otherwise ignore . However , it struck me as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously as a basis for policy and legislation and if parents were asking what the new brain science meant for raising their children and choosing schools . Following that call , I was no longer comfortable being merely puzzled or bemused about what I read in the newspapers . I wanted to understand what was going on and to consider more carefully what the brain science might actually mean for children , parents , and policy . // The White House Conference // My job as a foundation officer responsible for funding research in mind , brain , and education , plus some strategic letters from colleagues , earned me an invitation to the April 17 , 1997 , White House Conference on Early Childhood Development and Learning : What New Research on the Brain Tells Us About Our Youngest Children . For those interested in children and education , the conference was an exciting development . It promised to focus the nation 's interest , even if only for a few days , on science , children , and related , highly significant social issues . What better occasion could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science meant for parenting and policy ? // Mrs. Clinton opened the conference . She emphasized the significance of our new understanding of the brain . Brain science confirms what parents have instinctively known , " that the song a father sings to his child in the morning , or a story that a mother reads to her child before bed , help lay the foundation for a child 's life , in turn , for our nation 's future . " Unlike fifteen years ago , when we thought babies ' brains were virtually complete at birth , she told us , we now know brains are a work in progress . This means , Mrs. Clinton said , that everything we do with a child has some kind of potential physical influence on that rapidly forming brain . Children 's earliest experiences determine how their brains are wired . The first three years are critically important because so much is happening in the baby 's brain . " These experiences , " Mrs. Clinton said , " can determine whether children will grow up to be peaceful or violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents themselves . " She did caution that the early years are not the only years that matter and that brain science also tells us that some parts of the brain , in her words the " neurological circuitry for many emotions , " remain a work in progress until children are at least 15 years old . // Mrs. Clinton introduced the president , who outlined several initiatives that his administration was undertaking on behalf of mothers , families , and the nation 's youngest citizens . The president in turn introduced the chairman for the morning session , Dr. David A. Hamburg , then president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York . It was Hamburg who three years earlier had initially called attention to the " quiet crisis " afflicting young children , a crisis addressed in the Carnegie Corporation 's report Starting Points . That report , in Hamburg 's words , " focused on the strong evidence from research on brain and behavior development , indicating the long term effects of early experience . " Starting Points , he said , also noted the wide gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know and what we are doing with that knowledge . The White House Conference represented a major step in an attempt to close that gap . // Dr. Donald Cohen , director of the Yale Child Study Center , spoke next . The Yale Center has been a leader in the areas of early childhood research and education . Mrs. Clinton had worked with the Child Study Center while she was a law student at Yale . In his talk , Cohen also mentioned that , while at Yale , both he and Mrs. Clinton had been students of Sally Provence , one of the pioneers in the study of early childhood deprivation . He proceeded to speak about the effects of early experience on children 's behavior and development , stressing parents ' active role in brain development and the importance of social and emotional relations in child development : " When parents and caregivers take care of a child they 're doing a lot more than just feeding or bathing or comforting . They 're helping the child 's brain to develop , shaping his temperament and teaching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enduring because they lay down the pattern for all future development . The correct experiences enable the child to use " his intellectual potential to its limits . " Although , he cautioned , we should never write children off , it can be difficult to change long-lasting , maladaptive patterns later in life . // Oddly , only one neuroscientist spoke at the White House Conference , Dr. Carla Shatz of the University of California at Berkeley . She spoke for eight minutes ( as did most of the other experts ) . Drawing on her own studies of the visual system , she summarized what neuroscientists know about early brain development . She explained that there are two major periods in brain development . During the first period , which starts before birth , the brain 's gross wiring is laid out under genetic control . It is as if the brain were laying out the major trunk lines of a telephone system . Then , also prior to birth , a second phase begins . Spontaneous brain activity - neural firing that is not caused by sensory stimulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained , as " autodialing " among telephones . This activity among the brain 's neural cells begins to construct its fine wiring . Following birth , sensory experience takes the place of the spontaneous , automatic dialing to complete the wiring process . During the fine-wiring phase , the neural connections , or synapses , that are used become permanent and the others wither away . Neuroscientists believe , Shatz explained , that relying on neural activity for fine-tuning results in brains that are more complex and sensitive than if they were hard-wired at birth . This complexity and sensitivity has survival value . As Shatz said , " If after all , things were just hard-wired - if everything in the brain were just strictly programmed genetically by molecules that wired everything up , A to B , C to D , and so on - then we would n't be nearly as adaptable as we are as organisms . " // She also summarized a classic piece of neuroscientific research that figures prominently in the early childhood literature . Adults who suffer from cataracts for extended periods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged eye 's optics . The surgery restores adults ' vision . Yet , children born with cataracts , if operated on at age 5 years , remain blind in the afflicted eye . Five years of abnormal visual experience early in life has different and more serious consequences than five years of abnormal visual experience late in life . David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel , who won the Nobel Prize in 1981 , developed animal models , using cats and monkeys , in an attempt to figure out why adults and young children fare so differently following surgical treatment for cataracts . They found , among other things , that if kittens were deprived of visual input to one eye early in development , the kittens remained permanently blind in that eye . It is this research , Shatz said , that underscores the importance of early experience for brain development . Brain science tells us , she concluded , that there are " early periods of development , windows of opportunity or critical periods , as scientists call them , during which time experience is essential for brain wiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only brain science presented at the White House Conference . // Dr. Patricia Kuhl , from the University of Washington , spoke about her work on infants ' speech perception . Babies are born with the ability to discriminate the sounds found in all human languages , Kuhl told us . In her research , she has found that by six months of age infants have already focused on the particular sounds that their native language uses . Simply listening to adult speech alters infants ' perceptual systems . This early perceptual learning makes the infant responsive to its linguistic environment but also renders the infant vulnerable , almost hostage , to that environment . She emphasized how important it is for parents to be sure that their infants can hear , see , and process stimuli present in the environment . She carefully noted that research can not yet tell us how much talking it takes - thirty minutes a day or two hours a day - to support this kind of development and learning . She discouraged parents from trying to accelerate the normal course of language development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach words to three-monthers. " //
