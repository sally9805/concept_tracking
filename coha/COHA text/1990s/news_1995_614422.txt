<p> Let us let our own children know that we will stand against the forces of fear . When there is talk of hatred , let us stand up and talk against it . When there is talk of violence , let us stand up and talk against it . In the face of death , let us honor life . . . . <p> Yesterday , Hillary and I had the privilege of speaking with some children of other federal employees , children like those who were lost here . One little girl said , " We should all plant a tree in memory of the children . " So this morning before we got on the plane to come here , at the White House , we planted that tree in honor of the children of Oklahoma . . . . <p> My fellow Americans , a tree takes a long time to grow , and wounds take a long time to heal , but we must begin . Those who are lost now belong to God . Some day we will be with them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives . <p> From President Clinton 's speech at the memorial service Sunday . Faces for federal workers WASHINGTON POST <p> Some of them are still buried in the rubble . Some are hospitalized , perhaps broken in body , if not in spirit , for the rest of their lives . Others have been memorialized by the nation . They are part of the group of an estimated 550 women and men who earned their living in that federal building in Oklahoma City . They are federal workers . <p> The next time you are tempted to go off on the federal work force , as if those employed inside federal office buildings constitute nothing more than a financial threat to the Republic , think of that gutted facility in Oklahoma City . But do n't stop there . <p> Suspects in this country 's worst bombing in 70 years are now in custody . Credit a swiftly launched , massive round-the-clock investigation conducted by thousands of law-enforcement agents and officers around the country - yet more federal government workers of that nameless , faceless , much-denounced variety . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categorical thoughts about federal workers not having to work for a bottom line and getting caught up in process rather than results and all the other easy words of generalized contempt that serve to undermine respect for the work these famously " faceless " workers actually perform , consider the possibility that they are good people who not only work hard but also are committed to the work they perform in our behalf . That is why so many of them were where they were when evil visited them Wednesday morning in Oklahoma City . <p> It was one of us DAN THOMASSON <p> Clearly , the trauma has been increased by the fact that this was not an attack by foreigners , but by Americans so twisted and alienated they perceive everyone in government as their enemy - even little children in a day-care center in a federal office building . <p> " It might have been easier , " said an Ada , Okla. , man , " had they not been Americans . I would just have been angry . Now I 'm angry and ashamed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Scripps Howard News Service . <p> Neighbors , heroes , family FRANK KEATING <p> Today we have our neighbors - more than 3 million Oklahomans , and never have we drawn so close together . <p> There is something special about our wonderful state . We have always known that . Now America does . Now the world does . <p> Today we have our fellow Americans , from the power of our federal relief and investigative agencies to the prayers of millions . They will bring us justice as they have already brought us hope , and we will be forever grateful for this outpouring of love and support . <p> Today we have our families , so many of them torn apart by sorrow and hurt but families still , strong through the generations , stronger yet through this terrible ordeal . <p> Today we have our heroes and we have our heroines , saints in gray and blue and whites and khakis - the rescuers and the healers . They have labored long and nobly and they have cried with us . . . . <p> Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . And our young people are very special to us . We have been brutally reminded of how precious they are by the events of the past several days . For them , we reserve our warmest hugs and our gentlest touch . <p> And today we have our God . He is not a God of your religion or mine , but of all people in all times . He is a God of love , but he is also a God of justice . Today , he assures us , once again , that good is stronger than evil , that love is greater than hate , that each of us is his special child embraced by his father 's love . <p> Frank Keating is governor of Oklahoma . This excerpt is from the memorial service Sunday . <p> Who is the enemy ? LOS ANGELES TIMES <p> The horrendous death toll at the wreckage of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City makes it imperative that federal and state authorities do everything possible to penetrate these groups and gain better intelligence - without going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Surveillance efforts are hampered by court rulings and policies that flowed from the illegal actions of the FBI and other government agencies during the 1960s and ' 70s that were aimed at squelching fully legal nonviolent dissent from leftist anti-war protesters armed with leaflets . <p> The current situation is vastly different . Motley uniformed " militias " in 47 states regularly drill with high-powered weapons in mock assaults against some imaginary enemy . Since we are not about to be invaded from Canada , who could that be ? Children in a day-care center in Oklahoma ? <p> At the very least , the Oklahoma episode suggests that Republicans in Congress should drop their ill-considered efforts to repeal the federal ban on assault weapons . If right-wing extremists are arming themselves to the teeth , one must worry that this is suggestive evidence they intend to use these weapons , and that any one of us could prove their target . <p> Spirit of the nation BILLY GRAHAM <p> That blast was like a violent explosion ripping at the bare heart of America . And long after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this senseless and evil outrage will remain . <p> But we come together here today not only to pray and forgive and love , but to say to those who masterminded this cruel plot and to those who carried it out , that the spirit of this city and this nation will not be defeated . <p> From the sermon by the Rev. Billy Graham at the memorial service Sunday . <p> A small piece of togetherness ELLEN GOODMAN For once , we are in it together . <p> Never mind all the America-watchers who say this is not a country but a giant centrifuge . On Sunday , the center held in a state fairground in Oklahoma . <p> The common wisdom is that Americans have too little in common . We are said to be isolated in our homes , communicating with disembodied strangers along the Internet . We are told that civic life has disintegrated . Why , even when we bowl , it 's no longer in leagues : We bowl alone . <p> Maybe so . But we mourn together . We line up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply be together at a memorial service . And yes , we sit in front of the television set watching the same service together . <p> Just a week ago , a cottage industry of O.J. analysts , justifying the coverage , said we were only united by this media circus . After Oklahoma , the bickering among jurors in a murder trial seemed like the shameless whining of spoiled brats . . . . <p> For more than a year , the drumbeat of anti-government rhetoric banged out its monotone rage at faceless bureaucrats - the government - with their hands in our pockets . But as bodies were brought out of the Alfred P. Murrah building , the drumbeat become a sad roll call of mothers , fathers , wives , husbands , parents , neighbors . And worst of all , the children . . . . <p> It takes hundreds of people to construct an office building and only a couple to blow it up . It takes thousands of people to create a sense of community , and only a handful to destroy it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As we go about our business , the business of mourning and the business of justice , keep this one small piece of togetherness alive . A plea to lower the angry voices . A memory of how sadness sounds . As quiet as a house without children . <p> Ellen Goodman is associate editor of the Boston Globe and a syndicated columnist .
