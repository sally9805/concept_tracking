The black-masked leader of the insurgent Zapatista National Liberation Army , who calls himself Subcomandante Marcos , summoned nearly 5,000 activists deep into the Lacandon forest in Chiapas state last week to deliver his campaign promise . In an open-air amphitheater hastily erected of logs , as storm clouds gathered overhead , Marcos issued a stern warning to the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari . If there is fraud in the upcoming national election , he declared , there will be an explosion of protest that will shut down Mexico . Just as he stopped speaking , a powerful downpour brought the four-day gathering to a sudden end , setting off a dangerous shower of sparks from the encampment 's electric lights . <P> Though few in Mexico really expect a massive uprising when the winner is announced after next week 's presidential vote , the Chiapas declaration touched a national nerve . An anxious Mexico , ruled by the longest-lived one-party system in the world , is about to hold its most competitive election ever . For the first time since 1929 , the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the opposition has a genuine chance of winning . Yet most prospective voters remain to some degree skeptical of government promises that the vote will be completely clean and fraud free .

The January uprising by peasants in Chiapas , the assassination of the ruling party 's presidential candidate in March , a gradual downturn in the economy , and an outburst of drug shootings and kidnappings have convinced a large segment of Mexico 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month ago , they appeared to resent the failures of the Salinas government so bitterly that many were ready to turn out his Institutional Revolutionary Party ( P.R.I. ) . <P> The most recent polls indicate that voters may well adhere to their favorite axiom : Better the evil you know than the one you have yet to meet . " Mexicans are torn between their desire for change and their fear of change , " says Delal Baer , director of the Mexico Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . In the privacy of the voting booth , she added , they may well choose the certitude of the P.R.I . over the question marks represented by the opposition .
