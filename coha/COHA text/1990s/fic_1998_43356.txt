ON THE SHORES OF A GREAT LAKE , THE KILLER WINTER IS COMING , AN INDIAN BOY CALLED LITTLE TWIG IS DETERMINED TO PROTECT HIS FAMILY-AND BECOME A MAN . <p> Little Twig was bleeding . A jagged rock had torn through his moccasin , clear I through the deerskin and into his foot . It hurt . He sloshed through the creek , back to the grassy shore . He pried the soaking-wet moccasin off his foot . There was a gash . Little Twig dipped his foot into the cold creek . Blood swirled up through the water like red smoke . He ripped off a handful of leaves from a fern growing next to him . He dug his hand into the dirt and came up with a mound of mud . He eased his foot out of the water . Ouch ! He placed the clean leaves over the cut . He patted the mud over the leaves to keep them in place . Little Twig was only 10 years old . But like most Ojibway children , he knew how to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt angry at himself for cutting his foot . He was so worried about finishing his beaver skins that he was n't being mindful . This was dangerous . You always had to be careful in the woods . He looked anxiously over at his beaver skins . He had caught the beavers by himself , in a trap he made out of the bark of a basswood tree . His plan was to surprise his father with the two pelts . " Little Twig , " his mother called . Little Twig scrunched up his face . When would his parents stop calling him Little Twig ? That was his baby nickname . Was n't he grown up ? He had tried to kill an elk to bring home to his parents . The first time an Ojibway boy killed an elk , his village celebrated with a feast . Little Twig had tried , but his arrows would n't shoot hard enough . Or fast enough . Still , he had managed to trap two beavers . " He would hide them until he and his father arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he saw the furs . Then maybe he and his mother would stop calling him Little Twig . " Little Twig , " his mother called again . " Here I am , " Little Twig called back . Little Twig wanted to be called by his dream name , the magical name he was given when he was born . Most Ojibway children have a dream name , given to them by a tribe elder . The night he was born , his grandfather had a dream about a raven flying above the frozen lake . In the dream , the raven had icicles dripping from his wings . But even though his wings were frozen , the bird could still fly . Like a miracle . His grandfather named him for that miracle bird . His dream name was Ice Feather Boy . His family believed that the raven in the dream would watch over Little Twig as he grew up in the woods . Ojibway people believed that your dream name would protect you from danger . There were so many dangers in the woods surrounding Kitchigami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bears who might rip at you with their claws . There were moose who were either so stupid or so mean that they would run you over if you were . in their way . LITTLE TWIG 'S CLOTHES WERE MADE OF DEER SKIN . HIS MOTHER TANNED THE DEER HIDE TO MAKE IT VERY SOFT . SHE SEWED THE CLOTHING USING A NEEDLE MADE FROM SHARPENED ANIMAL BONE . THE THREAD WAS MADE FROM DRIED ANIMAL TENDONS . <p> Scariest of all , there was winter - the long , dark , freezing , icy , stormy winter of Kitchigami . Last winter , there was a storm that lasted for 26 moons . Little Twig 's baby sister had died . A blanket of snow buried their wigwam . The cold wind turned the snow to ice . Little Twig 's parents could n't get out of the wigwam to get more wood for the fire . The warmth went away . Their baby girl died before the sun could crack the ice and set them free . They had called her Smile Berry Girl because she loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always smiling . Little Twig wondered : why did n't my icy miracle bird watch over our baby girl ? " Little Twig , " his mother called through the woods . " Come home now . " Little Twig cleaned his foot in the water . The bleeding had stopped . He stuck his foot in his soggy moccasin . He carefully rolled up his beaver skins and wrapped them in an old piece of moosehide . Then he buried them in the wet dirt near the creek . He would unearth them tomorrow before they left for the trading post . As he trotted through the woods to his family , he noticed how green the leaves were on the trees . He felt the warm breeze in his face . It was still Strawberry moon . Winter would n't be here for a time . And Little Twig tried not to feel scared . He had a brand-new baby brother now , a round little boy they called Cub . At night , Little Twig twirled Cub around in the wigwam . He tickled him with a toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He smiled when he thought of his baby brother 's brand-new smile . But then he felt scared again . Would his icy miracle bird watch over them this winter ? The Tradinq Post The day had come for Little Twig and his father to leave for the trading post at the great falls . He had his skins hidden in his moose hide . Maybe his skins did n't look as perfect as his father 's . But he knew his father would be proud . Little Twig planned to trade them for a crooked knife . This was a special knife that Ojibway men used to make canoes . Surely someone with a knife would have the respect of the village . Surely that person would no longer be considered a child . Named Little Twig . Little Twig 's father had loaded the canoe with skins . They had 160 beaver skins , thick and smooth and shiny brown . They had snow-white weasel skins , black sable skins , and a stack of tiny brown-and-white- spotted rabbit skins . The white men from England were hungry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew rich selling the furs in Europe and China . Little Twig did n't know where these places were . But he imagined that everyone wore a beaver robe and sable hat . The journey to the great falls would take 28 moons . They paddled by day and slept on the shore at night . The evening before they arrived , Little Twig and his father paddled their canoe to the shore . Little Twig 's father caught a fish and roasted it on a fire . Then they spread out their rush mats that Little Twig 's mother had woven for them . Little Twig snuggled close to his father . " Do n't be scared of the owls , " his father said . " I 'm not , father , " Little Twig said . But he was . Ojibway believed that owls brought bad luck . Storytellers told tales of owls that swept into wigwams at night and stuck children into their ears and carried them away . " Tell me about what we 'll find at the trading post , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Kitchigami , " his father said . " They have kettles and knives and hatchets made of iron . They have rifles and whiskey . " Little Twig imagined his knife . " And they have wool , " his father said . " What is wool ? " Little Twig asked . " Wool comes from sheep , " his father said . " Sheep is an animal that is low and fat like a wild pig . When the fur gets thick , it is cut off . The fur is washed and spun into string . Then the string is woven into fabric . " " What is the fabric for ? " Little Twig said . " Wool is very warm , " his father said . " And wool will keep you warm even when it is wet . " CUB SPENT MUCH OF HIS TIME IN A WOODEN CRADLE BOARD . THIS ALLOWED HIS MOM TO CARRY H1M AROUND ON HER BACK , OR STAND HIM UP SO SHE COULD DO HER MANY JOBS , LIKE COOKING , SEWING , TANNING HIDES , AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was tired . Hoot , went an owl . Little Twig snuggled closer to his father . He tried not to think about the coming winter . Instead , he thought about the beaver skins and how proud his father would be . He thought about his crooked knife . As he drifted off to sleep , he tried to imagine what a sheep looked like . The Great Falls They arrived at the trading post before the sun had risen to the top of the sky . Little Twig had never seen so many white men . There were some white men on Kitchigami , French men who came to trade and trap with the Ojibway . But here there were more white men than Indians . <p> Little Twig 's father only spoke a few words of English . He had learned it from one of the traders at Kitchigami . None of the English men spoke Ojibway . But Little Twig could tell that the men liked his father 's furs . They gave his father a kettle , 3 hatchets with sharp iron blades , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother . His father also got enough wool fabric for leggings and shirts for the family . When his father was gathering up his goods , Little Twig opened up the moosehide . His father stared at his beaver skins . " Where did you find those ? " he asked . " I made a trap and caught the beavers , " Little Twig said . " I skinned them in the woods near the creek . I want to trade them for a crooked knife . I want to have a knife . " Little Twig waited for the pride . " You are learning , " his father said . " Some day you will learn to skin beavers so their skins are perfect . " This was not what Little Twig expected to hear . " These skins will be enough for a crooked knife , " his father said . He motioned to the white man who was putting his father 's furs into neat stacks . They exchanged a few English words that Little Twig could n't understand . Little Twig 's father gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took his first load outside . The white man handed Little Twig a crooked knife . It had a wooden handle and a small metal blade . Little Twig held the knife . He waited . The knife did n't make him feel much different . Much older or stronger . Then he thought about his baby brother , Cub . Little Twig handed his knife back to the white man . He pointed to a roll of wool fabric . He would trade his beaver skins for a small piece of wool . His mother could sew it into a blanket for Cub . A blanket that would keep their baby warm . In the winter . Little Twig 's father was waiting for him . He raised his eyebrows when he saw the wool . " For Cub , " he told his father . " Mother can make a blanket . " LITTLE TWIG RATHER BUILT THIS CANOE OUT OF STICKS FROM A WHITE CEDAR TREE , HE COVERED THE FRAME WITH THE BARK OF A BIRCH TREE . THEN HE SEWED EVERYTHING tOGETHER WiTH STURDY TREE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now Little Twig saw the pride . In his father 's eyes . Little Twig 's father put his hand on Little Twig 's shoulder as they walked back to the canoe . The wind felt colder . But Little Twig did n't notice . That night , when Little Twig and his father slept on their rush mats , Little Twig kept Cub 's wool next to him . " Father , " he said . " Do n't be afraid of the owls . " " I 'll try , " his father said . Little Twig closed his eyes . " Good night , " his father said . " Dream well , Ice Feather Boy . "
