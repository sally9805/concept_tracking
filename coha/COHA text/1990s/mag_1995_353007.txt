In its 86 years as the nation 's premier civil rights organization , the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has faced snarling police dogs , cross-burning Ku Klux Klansmen and murderous assaults on its members . But none of these posed as dangerous a threat to the N-Double-A 's continued survival as the group 's own recent leadership . Under the feckless sway of William F. Gibson , an inarticulate but wily South Carolina dentist who has chaired the group since 1985 , the organization has sunk into near bankruptcy  --  both financially and intellectually . Says Michael Meyers , a former n.a.a.c.p. staff member who now leads the New York Civil Rights Coalition : The N.A.A.C.P. has become a laughingstock . ' ' <P> Last week it came to a crossroads . Despite rumors that Gibson controlled most of the votes on the N.A.A.C.P. board , Myrlie Evers-Williams , the widow of civil rights martyr Medgar Evers , pulled off a stunning 30-to-29 victory to become the group 's head . I am here because I love the N.A.A.C.P. , ' ' she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it must thrive . ' ' The former executive at Atlantic Richfield , who now serves as a commissioner on the Los Angeles Board of Public Works , has always perceived the N.A.A.C.P. in terms of life and death . In 1963 she watched helplessly as her first husband , the N.A.A.C.P. 's field secretary in Mississippi , was shot to death at their home in Jackson . For the next 30 years , Evers-Williams campaigned relentlessly to bring the accused murderer , white supremacist Byron de la Beckwith , to justice . He was convicted in 1994 . Duty beckons me , ' ' she said , before the raucous N.A.A.C.P. meeting in New York City on Saturday . I am strong . Test me and you will see . ' ' <P> She can expect much testing . The organization 's deficit stands at more than $4.5 million . The search for a successor to ousted executive director Benjamin Chavis has not even begun . ( Chavis was fired last year for agreeing to pay more than $300,000 in N.A.A.C.P. funds to a female former employee who complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval of the board of directors . ) Last week Stephanie Rones , a former deputy legal counsel , filed a suit that accused Gibson , Chavis and four other N.A.A.C.P. officials of knowingly tolerating discrimination against women employees . Rones is seeking $800,000 in damages .
