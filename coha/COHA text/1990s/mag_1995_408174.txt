In November ' 94 we ran a story called " Dial Your Bike , " in which we suggested smart equipment improvements for medium-price , decent-quality machines . Among the upgrades we listed for both road and mountain bikes was a new crankset , which can shed about 6 ounces . Since then we 've been deluged with requests to explain just how a crankset replacement is done . So here you have it . While weight savings is a good goal , you might also upgrade a crank to change gearing and/or crankarm length , or replace an old or damaged unit . We 'll assume you are working on a frame with British threads and upgrading to a cartridge-style bottom bracket ( BB ) , because both are becoming the norm . Supplement the following instructions with those that come with your new BB. 1 Put the bike into the repair stand and shift onto the large chainring . This covers its teeth , protecting your knuckles should you slip while working . Rotate the right crankarm until the pedal is at 3 o'clock . Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the arm . Now forcefully push the wrench down while holding either crankarm . This loosens the pedal ( photo ) . ( photo omitted ) Continue to turn it counterclockwise to remove . Repeat the procedure for the left pedal , which is reverse threaded . Turn it clockwise to remove . 2 To remove the old crankset , first look at the outside of an arm where it attaches to the BB axle . If you see the head of a bolt or nut , or a large opening for an allen wrench , use the appropriate tool to turn it counterclockwise until the part comes out or the arm comes off . Repeat on the other side . If these parts are n't visible , they 're covered by dustcaps . These come in several styles . You may see a slot near one edge for prying with a screwdriver ; 2 small holes for unscrewing counterclockwise with a pin tool ( photo ) or a hammer and punch ; a 5-mm hexagonal hole in the center for removing with an allen wrench ; or a slot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Photo omitted ) Be sure to remove any washers that may be behind the crankarm bolts or nuts . 3 To remove arms that were n't automatically extracted in step 2 , use the remover tool designed for your crank . Fully unscrew the plunger part , then thread the remover into the crankarm as far as it will go . Turn the plunger clockwise with an adjustable wrench ( photo ) or its handle , pulling the arm off the axle . ( Photo omitted ) Repeat on the other side . 4 There are 2 types of BBs : cup-and-cons , and cartridge . To remove the first , unscrew the left-side lockring by turning it counterclockwise with a lockring wrench . Unscrew the cup with a pin tool , then pull out the BB axle . Reach inside the frame and remove any bearings and the plastic sleeve ( if there is one ) . Place the fixed-cup wench on the cup that 's still in the frame , and try to turn it clockwise . ( It 's reverse-threaded Fixed cups can be difficult to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To remove a cartridge BB , unscrew the left cup counterclockwise with the special lockring tool , then extract the cartridge by turning the right side clockwise ( photo ) . ( Photo omitted ) 5 Shove a rag through the bottom bracket to clean the frame , then lightly grease the inside to rustproof it . Follow the installation instructions for the new BB . The longer end of the axle should go on the right ( chainring ) side with the reverse-threaded cup . Start turning the cup and cartridge counterclockwise by hand until you 're sure it 's going in straight , then continue with a wrench until it 's two-thirds in . Do the same with the left cup , which is turned clockwise . For Shimano BBs , tighten the right cup until its shoulder strikes the frame . Then tighten the left cup until it stops . Most other brands use lockrings to hold the cups in place . Lubricate lockring threads with grease ; use antiseize for titanium . Follow the instructions to seat the cups . Then install the lockrings and tighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omitted ) 6 If you purchased an assembled crankset , turn each chainring bolt clockwise with a 5-mm allen wrench to make sure they 're tight , If you bought crankarms only , remove the chainrings from the old arm . If a bolt spins but does n't unscrew , try pushing the wrench to the side as you turn it . If this does n't work , hold the back of the bolt with a chainring bolt spanner ( photo ) . ( Photo omitted ) 7 Grease the bolts and install the rings on the new crankarm , copying their original order and position . On some cranks you also have to install the spider that holds the chainrings . Usually it 's easiest to install the outer ring(s) before installing the spider and inner ring . Now place the right crankarm on the BB axle and tighten it fully . If you purchased the correct BB , the chainline ( alignment of the crankset with the cassette ) should be good . To check , lay a straightedge between the chainrings and see where it falls on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chainline is spot on , the straightedge will bisect the cassette . ( For triple chainrings , lay the straightedge on either side of the middle ring and estimate the centerline . ) If chainline is more than 2 mm off , you may have problems with shifting . Some high-end American BBs allow chainline adjustments by loosening the lockrings and moving the cartridge sideways , so check the instructions . Otherwise , you may have to exchange the bottom bracket for one with a different axle length . 8 Install the left crankarm and tighten it securely . If there are threaded dustcaps , grease the threads lightly before you install them . Wipe the pedal threads clean , then apply a dab of fresh grease and screw them into the arms , making sure they 're on the correct sides . ( The pedals may be marked L and R on the axle . ) Remember , the left pedal screws in counterclockwise . Now check front derailleur adjustment by shifting across the rings . Make slight corrections by using the derailleur 's limit screws ( photo ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel ; clockwise restricts travel . Adjust the screws so the chain does n't rub the cage when it 's in the small ring/largest cog combination , or in the large ring/smallest cog combo . Also , make sure the crankarm does n't hit the cage in the latter gear . After a few rides , double-check all crankset bolts for tightness . <p>
