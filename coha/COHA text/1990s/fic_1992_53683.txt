The first time Sam ever left her children behind to go away by herself , they were two and five . It was a long time ago . She went to a hot springs resort , where she met a very hairy man . Because the man had been there before , and Sam had not , he offered to take her for a walk along a trail he knew , to a good swimming place in the creek . When they got there , they both took off their clothes and basked on a big hot rock in the sun . He was a hairy psychiatrist from San Francisco . <p> But his hairiness was actually the second most noticeable thing about him . The first thing Sam had noticed was that he was very short , much , much shorter than she was , certainly the shortest man who 'd ever courted her . And because of his hairiness , and because he was slight in his build , he reminded her of a monkey when he took of his clothes , especially when his little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home again , he called her and asked her for a date . She had n't really liked him , not bemuse he was short or hairy , but because he seemed kind of shallow . Although if he 'd been a tall man , maybe she would have thought he was deep . In any case , she agreed to go out with him . This was partly because she was n't very good at saying no , and partly because his shortness made it seem like an adventure . <p> When he came to pick her up , she was giving the kids " cheese dreams " for supper . ( This was the name for grilled cheese sandwiches that had been handed down from grandmother to mother to daughter in her family . ) She brought him into the kitchen . He was wearing high-heeled cowboy boots , but he was still short . She introduced him to the kids , and after a polite pause , Joe , who was five , said , " Mom , do we know any midgets ' <p> She shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They went to a nearby cafe for coffee , and talked about house plants . She knew he 'd never ask her out again , and she was right . <p> At about the same time , Sam met an attractive man in her class on " Communication Disorders . " From what she could see of him at first , he was less than hairy  --  he was almost totally bald . And he was young to be so bald  --  probably about thirty . She found the baldness appealing ; it made him seem clean and strong and smart . <p> He took her on a picnic to a nude beach , and when he took off his clothes she was stunned by his hairiness . It made her wonder if early baldness was correlated with lots of body hair . All the way down his back , from his neck to his ankles , there was no bare skin to be seen . Even his buttocks were covered with curly black hair . And he was big and muscular . <p> She tried not to appear self-conscious as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a towel . She tried to seem like a person who 's quite casual about going to a nude beach with a strange man , even such a hairy one . <p> It was hard to decide whether to lie on her stomach or her back  --  there were disadvantages to both positions She started out lying on her back , because she felt less vulnerable this way , but right away he said , " If you turn over I 'll put some sunscreen on yourback . " So she did , and could take no pleasure in it , knowing she 'd have to do the same for him . <p> Indeed , as soon as she was oiled , he said , " Will you do me now ? " She straddled the backs of his hairy thighs and spread oil on his back , and the hair got all shiny . She wondered if he had to wash his back with shampoo . He , too , reminded her of an animal , but certainly not a monkey . Maybe a bear  --  a bear with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He said , " Some women are put off by my body hair . I sometimes wonder if I should do something about it . " <p> " Oh , it does n't bother me , " Sam said . This was n't really true , but she knew she could get used to it , if she had a reason to , if they fell in love or something like that . <p> But he never called her back . Probably he always took women to the nude beach on the first date to check them out , and she had n't passed inspection . Maybe her stretch marks had fumed him off . <p> She saw him again in class after that , but they barely spoke . She supposed this was an example of a communication disorder . <p> Her little boys had such smooth , hairless bodies . It was hard to believe that they would ever have dark , coarse body hair . <p> In those days , Sam liked men 's beards , because beards made her feel different from them  --  more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was Sam , and because she had grown up as a tomboy , she wanted extra reminders that in between her and men there were differences ; in between , there was sex . <p> Later , this changed . She liked to feel the same as her lovers . It felt sexier when they had just shaved and had smooth chins , and not too much body hair . She felt charged up , as she had when she was a tomboy , climbing trees and playing doctor with the neighborhood boys . <p> Still later , she realized it was of no significance whatever whether a man was hairy or smooth , a Jacob or an Esau . There were more important considerations . As her grandmother used to say , " Handsome is as handsome does . " Hair is just hair , skin is skin , whiskers are whiskers . Everybody is already perfect just as they are . Although her grandmother would n't have agreed with that philosophy . <p> Long after she stopped caring about hair , one way or the other , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was her boyfriend , and who happened to be quite hairy . ( It was a different hot springs from the one where she met the man who was not a midget . ) They sat in a giant bathtub together for a long time , and he stretched out so that his hairy thighs were about a quarter of an inch below the surface of the water , and the leg hair reached up and lay along the surface , and moved gently to and fro , like kelp , in the currents of the bathtub . <p> They were very happy that afternoon . They stayed there a long time . It was as much fun as anything else they ever did together  --  watching his leg hair drifting on the surface of the sulphurous water . On that afternoon she believed he was perfect just as he was , and maybe even she was , too . But the feeling did n't last , and they broke up . <p> What she felt when they parted would n't turn out to be true : that he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the last particularly hairy man in her life , though she did n't think of that at the time . <p> <p> By Susan Moon <p>
