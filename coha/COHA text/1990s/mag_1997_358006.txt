Esprit de corps is a crucial factor in the military . But sometimes the spirit can get a little carried away . For a long time , at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri , when night fell and the sergeant was away , the soldier boys and soldier girls did play . And if the sergeant showed up , he was often greeted by a loud " Hello ! " The greeting , uttered heartily by recruits standing watch on each floor of the three-story brick barracks , was not quite military protocol . Rather , it was a warning to those engaged in hanky-panky to end their trysts and jump back into their own bunks . " Males are going down to females ' rooms and they 're linking up , " Sergeant First Class Robert Swindells , a 15-year veteran , complained last summer about his teenage recruits . " Then they 're going down into empty rooms and doing whatever they want , and there 's nothing we can do about it . " <P> The behavior so shocked members of an independent panel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that men and women quickly be moved to different floors . The panel , headed by former Kansas Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker , went on to visit 16 other bases and interview some 1,000 recruits and 500 instructors . What they found only confirmed their initial alarm . Last week the panel issued a report recommending that the military end mixed-gender barracks altogether . Furthermore , the study raised as its ideal the policy to which the Marines have adhered all along : single-sex basic training ( " boot camp " ) , segregated barracks and tougher physical training . The report was immediately assailed not only by feminists but by military insiders . Coed training at all levels has been the rule in the Army for the last three years , in the Navy since 1992 and in the Air Force since 1977 . Nearly 14% of the nation 's 1.4 million soldiers , sailors , airmen and Marines are female . <P> Even before the panel arrived to inspect Fort Leonard Wood last September , the Army had tried to control the raging hormones of the teenagers it recruited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into adjoining rooms housing up to eight soldiers , all the same sex . The Army also removed all of the bedroom doors to allow sergeants to monitor activities more closely . But with the recruits ' doors gone , lights-out in barracks also meant lights-out in the halls if the recruits were to get any sleep . The increased darkness , however , only allowed for more sexual misbehavior . " It hurts morale , " a male recruit said privately , " when you 've got boyfriends and girlfriends , and not just soldiers , sprinkled around the unit . " <P> In a recent Army report , investigators found a " high frequency " of sexual relations between male and female recruits at bases across the country . Another study , which surveyed unmarried female Army recruits at Fort Jackson , S.C. , reported the " loneliness and isolation " of basic training pushes some into sexual relations with their male colleagues . It is , however , also a continuation of normal civilian behavior . The female recruits were sexually active in the first place : nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average of three partners before enlisting .
