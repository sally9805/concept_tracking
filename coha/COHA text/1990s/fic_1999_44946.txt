Lisa Tuttle is the author of such novels as Familiar Spirits , Gabriel , and most recently , The Pillow Friend Her most recent book is an anthology she edited , Crossing the Border , which has just recently been published in England . Her new story , like Robert Grossbach 's ( and Esther Friesner 's , for that matter ) , features a woman whose love life has n't been all she 'd like it to be . But how come her friends do n't have such troubles . <p> PEOPLE CAN CHANGE . People do . But some things remain the same - like my love for you . Once upon a time , when I first fell , I told you what we could have together was not exclusive and would not last forever . I never used the 1-word , and I drew away a little , disbelieving or offended , when you did . I told you , quite honestly , that I had no desire for children , and no use for a husband of my own . I was quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not surprising if you never understood how much I loved you when I took such care to disguise my deepest feelings . I was a woman with a past , after all . A woman of a certain age , happiest living on my own ( well , with a cat ) and with plenty of lovers already notched into my belt . I was past forty when I met you , and the easy-loving days of my youth , when the times between men were measured in days or weeks rather than months or years , were gone . I had been celibate for more than six months when I met you . I was feeling a little desperate , and I fell for you hard . You probably wo n't believe that , if you remember how hard I made you work to get me . Once I saw I 'd caught your attention - the space between us seemed charged , remember ? - I became distant , ironic , cool . I treated you with a casualness that bordered on the insulting . I was so desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect . Nothing drives people away more than neediness . And then , after we had become lovers , once you were well and truly caught , I guess it became a sort of habit , the way I was with you , as if you were an irritation to me , as if I suffered you to make love to me now and again as a very great favor . But our affair went on for nearly seven years . Think of it . And eventually , our positions became reversed . I was no longer the less-loving , the more-loved - that was you . You grew tired of my undemanding presence , and called me less , or made excuses at the last minute to cancel a date . Did you really think I would n't mind ? That I might even be grateful to lose you ? That it would n't nearly destroy me ? Well , as I said before , people change . I might have shrugged and cut my losses- dropped you before you could formalize our break - and bounced back in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you was the loss of the last of my youth , practically the loss of life itself . I was surprised by how hard it hit me . If I could n't win you back , I was going to have to learn some new way of living , to cope with my loss . I thought about my friends . Over the years that once large throng of independent single women who had comprised the very core of my city , my emotional world , had been whittled away by marriage , parenthood , defection to other parts of the country , and even death . Three remained , women I had been friends with for nearly thirty years , whom I saw regularly and thought of as " like me . " Janet was an artist , Lecia was a writer and Hillary was a theatrical agent . We had similar emotional histories and similar lifestyles , in our small apartments with our cats , in love with men who saw us in the time they could carve out from their real lives with their wives and children elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cheered and commiserated with each other , staying loyal to a certain vision of life while the men , the cats , the jobs and other details changed . Now that I thought about it , though , I realized that I alone of the sisterhood still had a lover . The other three were all " between men " - and had been for at least two years . What 's more , they seemed content . In the old days , celibacy would have been a matter for complaint and commiseration . I could n't think of the last time we 'd had a good moan about the perfidy of men , or a plotting session devoted to fixing up someone with Mr. Right . Bits of subliminal knowledge , memories of certain looks , words unspoken , hints , fell together in my mind . I scented a conspiracy . They knew something that I did n't . And I needed help . I went to see Lecia . Our friendship was based on straightforwardness , intellectual discussions , a liking for the same books , an interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot alike , and I knew I could be straight with her . When we were settled with our cups of decaffeinated latte , I asked if there was a man in her life . She chuckled and gave me a funny , assessing look over her cup . " No one except James . " James was her cat , purring in her lap . Lecia lived near Washington Square , and the cat had turned up in her life a few years earlier just after she 'd embarked on her project of reading or rereading the entire works of Henry James . " How long has it been since you split up with ... ? " " Three years . " " And there has n't been anybody since ? " She shook her head . " And it 's all right ? You do n't miss ... all that ? " Her mouth quirked . " Do I look frustrated ? " I gave her a careful inspection and shook my head . " You look great . Really relaxed . Is that the yoga ? Hormones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than me , had elected to go for HRT when the menopause hit . She chuckled . " I think it 's contentment . " " You do seem happy , which is hopeful . But-was n't it hard at first ? " " What 's all this about ? " she asked . " William ? Has William- " I shook my head . " Not yet . He has n't said anything , but .. . I think he 's met someone , or if he has n't , he 's looking . He 's tired of me , I can feel it . " " Poor baby . " She sounded so detached , as if she 'd never had to worry about being left by a man in her life . It annoyed me , because I remembered when things had been otherwise . Three years ago . What was the guy 's name ? Jim . His marriage had ended , his affair with Lecia continued , and then he 'd been offered a job in Albuquerque - and he 'd taken it , just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't even ask Lecia if she 'd go with him . She had been devastated . Looking at her now , remembering her face distorted with tears and the sympathetic tension in myself , I could hardly believe it was the same woman . " How long did it take you to get over Jim ? " I asked . " Did you just decide to give up on all men after he left ? " " Something like that . I decided .. . I decided I 'd never be at the beck and call of another man . I was going to be in control from then on , and get what I wanted , take what I wanted- ouch ! " James went flying off her lap . Lecia put her hand to her mouth and licked the scratch . She grinned crookedly . " Well , of course , there 's got to be give and take in any relationship . There 's bound to be conflict sometimes . But why let him make all the rules , call the shots , decide to leave you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I mean , you said - are you seeing someone ? " She would n't meet my eyes . " You see me as I am , a woman alone except for her cat . And her women friends . You 're the one with manproblems . " " And you 've solved yours . So what do you advise me to do ? Drop him before he drops me ? " " Only if that 's what you want . " " It 's not . I want him . " To my annoyance , tears came to my eyes . " And if I ca n't have him , well ... then I want to be happy without him . The way you seem to be . " I pressed harder , trying to make her acknowledge me and my right to know . " You and Janet and Hillary ... you all seem so content to be alone . What 's your secret ? " She looked at me , but there was a reserve , a withholding , in her eyes . " You should get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I have a cat . " " Oh , yes , I was forgetting Posy . " She looked across the room at James , who was sitting in the corner washing his privates . I looked at Lecia 's face , which had gone soft , dreamy and sensual , and suddenly I saw that face on a woman lying naked on a bed , with the cat between her legs . The grossness of my imagination shocked me . I felt too embarrassed to stay longer . Lecia 's serene contentment certainly did n't have its source in bestiality . I was agitated not only by the unwanted pornographic fantasy , but also by the certainty that there was something which Lecia did not trust me enough to share . I did n't go home when I left her , but instead walked down to Tribeca , to the newish high-rise where Janet had her apartment . It was still Saturday morning , and I was betting I 'd find her in . She was , working on one of her intricate black and white illustrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seemed pleased for an excuse to take a break . " Red zinger , lemon and ginger , or peppermint tea ? " she asked as I followed her back to the kitchen . Grey the cat was sleeping on top of the refrigerator . He opened one eye to check us out , then shut it again . " Red zinger , please . " I watched Janet closely as she made the tea . She was slim and strong and she moved lightly as a dancer , humming under her breath . If I had n't been there she would probably have been talking to herself , I decided , but apart from the scattiness which she 'd always had , she looked serene and positively bursting with good health . " Do you mind being celibate ? " I asked her . She looked at me sharply . " Who says I 'm celibate ? " " Oh . Well , when was the last time you had sex ? " Spots of red appeared high on her cheekbones . " That 's kind of a personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew each other well enough after all these years to get kind of personal .... " Janet was one of the most highly sexed and sexually experienced women I knew , and she 'd never been one to keep quiet about the most intimate details . She 'd said nothing to me about sex or even romance for so long that I had assumed that there 'd been no men in her life since the disappearance of Leland . " Let 's go sit on the couch . " " Goody . " When we were settled , I said , " So there is somebody ? What 's the big secret ? Who is he ? " " Do you have some reason for wanting to know ? Apart from prurient curiosity ? " I laughed . " Prurient curiosity was good enough in the past . Look , as far as I knew , after Leland dumped you there was n't anybody . For , what is it , two years ? " " Not quite . " " Whatever - in all that time , as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , and it seems like you have n't wanted to , either . Same as Lecia . You seem so calm , so happy . I want to know your secret , because I have this awful feeling that William 's fixing to dump me , and the way I feel now , it 'll just kill me . If I ca n't keep him , I need to know how to survive - more than survive  --  without him . " Her eyes searched my face . " You love him ? " " Oh , God . Yes . More than anyone I 've ever - yes . " " Could you live with him ? " I hesitated . " I do n't know . It 's never been an option . He 's tired of me , anyway . If I pushed him , now , or tried to make him choose between me and his wife , I 'd lose him for sure . I can put up with sharing , with uncertainty - I 've done that for years . If I 've lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be okay about it . Like you and Lecia and Hillary . You seem so together , like you know something . You do , do n't you ? There is a secret ? " She gave the tiniest nod , then shook her head as if frantically trying to cancel it . " There is ! Oh , God , I ca n't believe you know something and you have n't told me . You and Lecia - I thought we were friends ! What did I do to you ? " We stared at each other like two kids on a playground , one the betrayer , one the betrayed , and I saw my anguish get to her . She could n't resist the claim of friendship . " You did n't come with us , " she said in a low , pleading voice . " I know it was n't your fault , but that 's why , that 's the only reason . If you 'd been with us , you 'd know , too . We swore we 'd never tell anyone else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not just anyone else - you should have been with us . It was meant for you , too . I 'm sure I 'm right . Wait , look , I 'll draw you a map . " She got up and went to her drawing table , found a piece of light card which was just the right size , and began to sketch and write something on it , muttering to herself . Then she presented it to me . " What 's this " " It 's where you have to go . " She leaned close and spoke very low , although we were alone . " Take William . Any excuse , a nice hike in the country , just get him there , find the fountain , and make him drink . Not you . Just him . If you ca n't get him to drink there , take a flask and make sure he drinks it later , when you 're alone together . " I 'd known Janet to be loopy sometimes - she was the fey and temperamental artist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anything going , really . For a time she had lived in an occult spiritual commune upstate somewhere . " And what happens then ? " I asked . " Shh ! Just do it . I really should n't be telling you . Now , go . " She pushed me toward the door , and I went without protesting that I had n't had my cup of Red Zinger . I looked at the card when I was in the elevator . The directions were to the Adirondacks , to the middle of nowhere , halfway up the side of a mountain where there was a magical fountain .... Then I remembered . The fountain . Three years ago , the others had gone on a camping trip , to a " magical place " with a " special fountain " that Janet had learned about in her commune days . It was meant to be a spiritual retreat and a bonding experience for us four friends . Only the night before we were to leave I ate a bad shrimp , and so while my friends were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a case of food poisoning . Something had happened to them , something they had never told me about , but which explained their solitary contentment . Outside , I crossed the street and walked past a couple of still unconverted warehouses with trucks in front and big , sweaty men unloading boxes and shouting at each other . I walked past , around , through them like a ghost . I ca n't say I missed the whistles and sexual commentary my presence would once have inspired , but just then I could have done without the reminder that I was an aging , invisible woman . A garish green poster , plastered on a wall , caught my eye . It had a spiral pattern and the only words I could read at a distance were TIR NAN OG . That was what the Celts called the Land of the Ever Young , but probably it was the name of a band or a club - my not knowing , my recognizing it only as a reference from an ancient culture , was just another proof of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was not my city anymore , I thought . This was not my country . The problem was , I did n't know where else I could go , or what else I could be , now that I was no longer a young and beautiful immortal . I looked at the card again . If it was the fountain of youth , why should n't I drink it ? Why should I give it to my lover ? Janet had been so definite . But what did it do ? If it was supposed to make your man love you again , why had Leland and jim disappeared ? Well , I had asked a question . Now I must make what I could of the answer YOU WERE SWEPT AWAY , you were charmed , by my sudden insistence on a weekend away . It had been a while since I 'd swept you off your feet . You were intrigued , too , because it was so unlike anything we 'd done together before . A day of hiking in the mountains ! As an excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of a spring-fed fountain mentioned in one of the books we were going to publish . You had so little notion of what a book-editor did , and , really , so little interest , that you believed what I said without question . I did n't ask what you 'd told your wife . At first it was like old times . The strain that had been between us disappeared , and we laughed a lot and touched each other as you drove us out of the city in the freshness of early morning . But the farther I got from the city and the world I knew , the more uneasy I felt . What was I doing ? I 'm a good walker , but only in the city , when there is some point to it , things to look at , places worth going to . I do n't like the country . It bores me and it makes me nervous ; okay , there have to be farms , and places for wild animals and plants , but I do n't see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fountain - did it follow that because I believed in romantic love I 'd also believe in magic ? I was n't Janet - what sort of desperation had made me believe in her magical fountain ? Naturally , I took it out on you . Your enthusiasm began to irritate me . What were you getting so excited about ? A walk in the country ? I did n't like hiking , why did n't you know that ? You wanted me to be something I was n't ; you would have preferred someone else . Before long and I 'm sure to your complete mystification we were arguing . By the time we reached the place where Janet had indicated we should leave the car , we were barely speaking to each other . You cheered up a little once you were out of the car , lacing on your new Danish hiking boots and inhaling the clean , cool air , but I felt an undissolved lump of dread sitting heavily in my stomach . But I was determined to go through with it now . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in my feeling better , but I would try . I am a good walker in the city , but I was n't used to hills , or to pathways slippery with pine needles , damp leaves , loose rocks . Nor could I keep up the pace you set . I had to keep stopping to catch my breath ; I had to keep calling you back . At first solicitous , you quickly became impatient . " If we do n't get a move on we wo n't even make the summit before dark , let alone get back down to the car again . " " We do n't need to go to the summit , " I pointed out . The idea filled me with exhausted horror . " Just to the fountain , and that should n't be much farther , as far as I can make out from this map ... " Squinting at it , it occurred to me that scale was not Janet 's strong point . You were as baffled by me as I was by you . What was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , it 's not that hard a climb . " " But I do n't want to go to the top . " I could n't keep the irritating whine out of my voice . " Will , I 'm wom out already . I want to stop at the fountain and have a picnic and a rest before we go back . " Your face began to cloud , but then it cleared . " Okay . You stay at the fountain and rest . I 'll climb to the summit alone and then come back for you . " I did n't like the idea much , but sometimes you have to compromise . We reached the fountain a few minutes later . First we heard the cool , gurgling sound of water , and then we found the source , hidden beneath a curtain of fems and ground-ivy . I pulled back some of the greenery to reveal the smooth rim of a stone bowl that caught the water flowing up from underground . There was a channel that sent the overflow spilling into a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hillside . " Want a drink ? " I asked . " From that ? " You frowned . " Better than recycled city water , " I tempted . " This is exactly the sort of stuff that gets bottled and sold to people like you in restaurants . " " I might try it when I come back . I do n't want to stop just now . You 'll be all right ? " " What about our picnic ? " You sighed . " The sooner I go , the sooner I 'll be back . You can eat some of this stuff while you 're waiting for me , if you want . I 'll just take a candy bar and my water flask . " Then you dropped a kiss on my head , determined not to be caught and delayed by anything as time-consuming as a real embrace . For a while , I sulked , counting the minutes , wondering how long it would take you to get there and back again . I wished I 'd brought a book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fountain , uncovering more of it from the encroaching plants . I scraped away the furry moss and found a figure carved in bas-relief : a cat , it looked like . Then there were markings that might have been writing , but the letters appeared to be Greek , which I ca n't read . It could have been graffiti left by fraternity boys from Syracuse or Cornell . I was thirsty . The trill of water made the feeling worse . I fetched my little plastic bottle of Evian and drank half of it . More out of boredom than hunger I ate lunch , and finished.off the Evian . Then I filled the bottle from the spring : my insurance in case I could n't get you to drink in situ . Then I sat down in the sun with my back against a rock and waited for you . I fell asleep and woke disoriented , hot and dry-mouthed . I thought that someone had been watching me and laughing , but that was only the music of the fountain . I was still alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then stopped , remembering that I had refilled it from the fountain . I licked dry lips and looked at my watch , which turned out to have stopped some hours earlier . The battery had been running down all day and I had n't noticed except to think how slowly time was passing . Where were you ? I felt as if I had been sleeping for hours . What if you had fallen and hurt yourself , what if something awful had happened ? I called your name , but the sound of my own voice echoing off the rocks in the empty air gave me the creeps . I advised myself to sit quietly and wait for you . If only I was n't so thirsty ! It was late September and the day was pleasantly cool , but the sun blazed down , making me hot . I wondered if I could be suffering from sunstroke . I plunged my hands and arms up to the elbow in the fountain to cool myself , and dabbed water on my face . I had never been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lips ? But I needed a drink . I longed for you to come back and save me with the dull , flat , safe city water in your flask . But you did n't come and did n't come and finally I could n't bear my thirst any longer and I drank . That was the best water I ever tasted . I drank and drank until my stomach felt distended . I felt content and at peace with the universe , without worries . I was no longer thirsty and no longer too hot . The sun felt good . The smooth rock where I had rested before was still warm with the sun , so I curled up there and went to sleep . I was awakened by the sound of you calling my name . I opened my eyes and stretched , and you turned and looked straight at me , but the worry did n't leave your face , and you did n't stop calling . Were you blind ? I got down and went over and pressed myself against you . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to stroke me . " Have you seen my girlfriend ? I guess she got fed up waiting and decided to hike back to the car alone . Only , if she did that , why 'd she leave her stuff ? " I wanted to explain , but no matter how I purred and cried and stropped myself against your legs , you just did n't get it . Are women more intuitive than men , or what ? I followed you to your car but you would n't have me . One of the sheriff 's men took me home with him after a day spent searching the mountainside for me . You did the decent thing , . regardless of the trouble it would make for you , and reported me missing . After many adventures I made my way back to Manhattan , and to Washington Square , and Lecia 's little apartment . I do n't think she recognized me ; at any rate , she shooed me off with a shocking lack of compassion . I hung around anyway , to give her another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the sudden appearance of a strange cat . I found a position on a fire-escape which gave me a view into her living-room window , and I hunkered down and waited . As soon as I saw her getting ready to go out I 'd make for her door and strop her ankles and purr like an engine . She would n't be able to resist me forever . So she had a cat already ; why should n't she have two ? I watched and waited and finally , after moonrise , I saw James the cat turn , in the magic circle of Lecia 's arms , into the man who was her lover . Finally I understood the secret of the fountain , and knew that my only hope was to find you . If you want me , you can have me again . For you , I 've left the city . For you , I 'll live in the suburbs . By day ; I 'll be the family cat . But at night , in your arms , secretly , while your wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make me change , if only you want me.
