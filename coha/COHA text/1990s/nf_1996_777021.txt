HOMER I // * The Iliad // * Professor Edward Tayler tells us we will build a self // * The college bookstore ; my lost attention // * Columbia students then and now // * C.C. begins : Anders Stephanson and the hegemony of the western calendar // * Professor Tayler teaches the Iliad // * Achilles the hero // I had forgotten . I had forgotten the extremity of its cruelty and tenderness , and , reading it now , turning the Iliad open anywhere in its 15,693 lines , I was shocked . A dying word , " shocked . " Few people have been able to use it well since Claude Rains so famously said , " I 'm shocked , shocked to find that gambling is going on here , " as he pocketed his winnings in Casablanca . But it 's the only word for excitement and alarm of this intensity . The brute vitality of the air , the magnificence of ships , wind , and fires ; the raging battles , the plains charged with terrified horses , the beasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust ; the ravaged longing for home and family and meadows and the rituals of peace , leading at last to an instant of reconciliation , when even two men who are bitter enemies fall into rapt admiration of each other 's nobility and beauty - it is a war poem , and in the Richmond Lattimore translation it has an excruciating vividness , an obsessive observation of horror that causes almost disbelief . // Idomeneus stabbed at the middle of his chest with the spear , and broke the bronze armour about him which in time before had guarded his body from destruction . He cried out then , a great cry , broken , the spear in him , and fell , thunderously , and the spear in his heart was stuck fast but the heart was panting still and beating to shake the butt end of the spear . // ( XIII , 438-44 ) // If I had seen that quaking spear in a shopping-mall scare movie , I would have abandoned the sticky floors and headed for the door . Exploitation and dehumanization ! Teenagers never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie trash ! Yet here is the image at the beginning of Western literature , and in its most famous book . // The quivering spear was hair-raising , though there were even more frightening images : eyeballs spitted on the ends of spears and held aloft in triumph , a blade entering at the mouth " so that the brazen spearhead smashed its way clean through below the brain in an upward stroke , and the white bones splintered . " Homer records these mutilations with an apparent physical relish that suddenly gives way to bitter sorrow ( this is one way the images differ from those in horror movies ) and to a yearning for ordinary life , a caress of nostalgia slipped into the mesmerizing catastrophe before us . The exultant violence is shot through with the most profound dismay . The Greeks , camped outside the walls of Troy , are far from home , but home , and everything lovely , proper , and comforting that might happen there , is evoked in heartbreaking flashes . There is the case of // Simoeisios in his stripling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore beside the banks of Simoeis when she had followed her father and mother to tend the sheep-flocks. // Therefore they called him Simoeisios ; but he could not render again the care of his dear parents ; he was short-lived , beaten down beneath the spear of high-hearted Aias , who struck him as he first came forward beside the nipple of the right breast , and the bronze spearhead drove clean through the shoulder . // He dropped then to the ground in the dust , like some black poplar ... // ( IV , 472-82 ) // The nipple of the right breast . Homer in his terrifying exactness tells us where the spear comes in and goes out , what limbs are severed ; he tells us that the dead will not return to rich soil , they will not take care of elderly parents , receive pleasure from their young wives . His explicitness has a finality beyond all illusion . In the end , the war ( promoted by the gods ) will consume almost all of them , Greeks and Trojans alike , sweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mystery in its irresistible momentum , its profoundly absorbing moment-to-moment activity and overall meaninglessness . First one side drives forward , annihilates hundreds , and is on the edge of victory . Then , a few days later , inspired by some god 's trick or phantasm - a prod to the sluggish brain of an exhausted warrior - the other side recovers , advances , and carries all before it . When the poem opens , this movement back and forth has been going on for more than nine years . // The teacher , a small , compact man , about sixty , walked into the room , and wrote some initials on the board : // W A S P // D W M // W C // D G S I // While most of us tried to figure them out ( I had no trouble with the first two , made a lame joke to myself about the third , and was stumped by the fourth ) , he turned , looking around the class , and said ardently , almost imploringly , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pleading and mournful , a lover who feared he might be thwarted . There was an alarming pause . A few students , embarrassed , looked down , and then he said : " This course has been under attack for thirty years . People have said " - pointing to the top set of initials - " the writers are all white Anglo-Saxon Protestants . It 's not true , but it does n't matter . They 've said they were all Dead White Males ; it 's not true , but it does n't matter . That it 's all Western civilization . That 's not quite true either - there are many Western civilizations - but it does n't matter . The only thing that matters is this . " // He looked at us , then turned back to the board , considering the initials " DGSI " carefully , respectfully , and rubbed his chin . " Do n't Get Sucked In , " he said at last . Another pause , and I noticed the girl sitting next to me , who has wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forehead , opening her mouth in panic . Others were smiling . They were freshmen - sorry , first-year students - and not literature majors necessarily , but a cross-section of students , and therefore future lawyers , accountants , teachers , businessmen , politicians , TV producers , doctors , poets , layabouts . They were taking Lit Hum , a required course that almost all students at Columbia take the first year of school . This may have been the first teacher the students had seen in college . He was n't making it easy on them . // " Do n't get sucked in by false ideas , " he said . " You 're not here for political reasons . You 're here for very selfish reasons . You 're here to build a self . You create a self , you do n't inherit it . One way you create it is out of the past . Look , if you find the Iliad dull or invidious or a glorification of war , you 're right . It 's a poem in your mind ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are honor gifts . They 're war booty , like tripods . Less than tripods . If any male reading this poem treated women on campus as chattel , it would be very strange . I also trust you to read this and not go out and hack someone to pieces . " // Ah , a hipster , I thought . He admitted the obvious charges in order to minimize them . And he said nothing about transcendental values , supreme masterpieces of the West , and the rest of that . We 're here for selfish reasons . The voice was pleasant but odd - baritonal , steady , but with traces of mockery garlanding the short , definitive sentences . The intonations drooped , as if he were laying black crepe around his words . A hipster wit . He nearly droned , but there were little surprises - ideas insinuated into corners , a sudden expansion of feeling . He had sepulchral charm , like one of Shakespeare 's solemnly antic clowns . // I remembered him well enough : Edward Tayler , professor of English . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( he was a young assistant professor then ) , a course in seventeenth-century Metaphysical poetry , which was then part of the sequence required for English majors at Columbia , and I recalled being baffled as much as intrigued by his manner , which definitely tended toward the cryptic . He was obviously brilliant , but he liked to jump around , keep students off balance , hint and retreat ; I learned a few things about Donne and Marvell , and left the class with a sigh of relief . In the interim , he had become famous as a teacher and was now the sonorously titled Lionel Trilling Professor in the Humanities - the moniker was derived from Columbia 's most famous English literature professor , a great figure when I was there in the early sixties . // " The Hermeneutic Circle , " Tayler was saying . " That 's what Wilhelm Dilthey called it . You do n't know what to do with the details unless you have a grip on the structure ; and at the same time , you do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's true in life and in literature . The Hermeneutic Circle . It 's a vicious circle . Look , we have only a year together . You have to read . There 's nothing you 'll do in your four years at Columbia that 's more important for selfish reasons than reading the books of this course . " // Could they become selves ? From my position along the side of the classroom , I sneaked a look . At the moment they looked more like lumps , uncreated first-year students . The men sat with legs stretched all the way out , eyes down on their notes . Some wore caps turned backward . They were eighteen , maybe nineteen . In their T-shirts , jeans , and turned-around caps , they had a summer-camp thickness , like counselors just back from a hike with ten-year-olds . Give me a beer . The women , many of them also in T-shirts , their hair gathered at the back with a rubber band , were more directly attentive ; they looked at Tayler , but they looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotations . At the top of the page were some verses from the beginning of Genesis . // And God said , Let there be light ; and there was light . // And God saw the light , that it was good : And God // divided the light from the darkness .... And God said , // Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters , // and let it divide the waters from the waters . // " You may not believe that God created the universe , " Tayler said , mournful , sepulchral , " but , anyway , look what God is doing in this passage . He 's setting up opposites . Which is something we do all the time in life . Moral opposites flow from binary opposites . There are people you touch , and people you do n't touch . Every choice is an exclusion . How do you escape the binary bind ? Look , St. Augustine , whom we 'll read later , says that before the Fall there were no involuntary actions . Before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pause , pause ... " If Adam and Eve wanted to do something , they did it . But you guys are screwed up ; you 're in trouble . There 's a discrepancy between what you want to do and what you ought to do . You want to go out and have a beer with friends , and you have to force yourself through a series of battles . After the Fall , you fall into dualities. " // There were other quotations on the sheet , including one from John Milton , but Tayler did n't say right then what their significance might be . He looked around . Was anyone getting it ? Maybe . Was I ? We would see . Then he turned all loverlike and earnest once more . And he said it again . // " Look , keep a finger on your psychic pulse as you go . This is a very selfish enterprise . " // By the time the action of the Iliad begins , the deed that set off the whole chain of events - a man making off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the participants . Homer , chanting his poetry to groups of listeners , must have expected everyone to know the outrageous old tale . Years earlier , Paris , a prince of Troy , visiting the house of the Greek king Menelaus , took away , with her full consent , Helen , the king 's beautiful wife . Agamemnon , the brother of the cuckold , then put together a loose federation of kings and princes whose forces voyaged to Troy and laid siege to the city , intending to punish the proud inhabitants and reclaim Helen . But after more than nine years of warfare , the foolish act of sexual abandonment that set the whole cataclysm in motion has been largely forgotten . By this time , Helen , abashed , considers herself merely a slut ( her embarrassed appearance on the walls of Troy is actually something of a letdown ) , and Paris , her second " husband , " more a lover than a fighter , barely comes out to the battlefield . When he does come out , and he and Menelaus fight a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war goes on . After nine years , the war itself is causing the war . // How can a book make one feel injured and exhilarated at the same time ? What 's shocking about the Iliad is that the cruelty and the nobility of it seem to grow out of each other , like the good and evil twins of some malign fantasy who together form a single unstable and frightening personality . After all , Western literature begins with a quarrel between two arrogant pirates over booty . At the beginning of the poem , the various tribes of the Greeks ( whom Homer calls Achaeans - Greece was n't a national identity in his time ) , the various tribes assembled before the walls of Troy are on the verge of disaster . Agamemnon , their leader , the most powerful of the kings , has kidnapped and taken as a mistress from a nearby city a young woman , the daughter of one of Apollo 's priests ; Apollo has angrily retaliated by bringing down a plague on the Greeks . A peevish , bullying king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other leaders , angrily gives the girl back to her father . But then , demanding compensation , he takes for himself the slave mistress of Achilles , his greatest warrior . The women are passed around like gold pieces or helmets . Achilles is so outraged by this bit of plundering within the ranks that he comes close to killing the king , a much older man . Restraining himself at the last minute , he retires from the combat and prays to his mother , the goddess Thetis , for the defeat of his own side ; he then sits in his tent playing a lyre and " singing of men 's fame " ( i.e. , his own ) as his friends get cut up by the Trojans . What follows is a series of battles whose savagery remains without parallel in our literature . // It is almost too much , an extreme and bizarre work of literary art at the very beginning of Western literary art . One wants to rise to it , taking it full in the face , for the poem depicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshaling , deploying , advancing , and fleeing , spelled by peaceful periods so strenuous - the councils and feasts and games - that they hardly seem like relief at all . Reading the poem in its entirety is like fronting a storm that refuses to slacken or die . At first , I had to fight my way through it ; I was n't bored but I was rebellious , my attention a bucking horse unwilling to submit to the harness . It was too long , I thought , too brutal and repetitive and , for all its power as a portrait of war , strangely distant from us. //
