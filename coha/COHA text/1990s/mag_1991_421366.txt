His grandfather was all-Japanese , his father was all-American . In Tokyo , a sansei searches for himself . <p> October 12 , 1984 , Tokyo-What do I find here ? Thousands of faces that look like mine , that day by day rush past me like a rainstorm , my eyes registering the movements , trying to adjust my body to avoid collision , never having a moment to stare into any face , to observe its features . Then we are there on the platform , craning our heads down the track , or lost in a book or newspaper , or quietly talking or blankly staring , and the train comes , and we push inside , crushed together , a wave of muscles and dead weight colliding , tugging , shoving , crunching tighter . In our own tiny space , we stand and look down , away from each other ; but sneaking these looks , I see the infinite variety of the faces , the ones that look Indian or Mexican or black or Chinese or Korean , that look like my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my sister , that look like the women in the ads plastered across the subway , the posters in the stations . I note the pale , powdered faces , the lavender eye shadow , the cool , placid surface , the perfection of a mask , a beautiful Japanese mask , or the freshfaced schoolgirls or boys , slight pimples breaking their complexion , or else the complexion whole and smooth , dark , rich , without a single splotch or blemish , and perhaps , like me , a tiny teardrop dimple just below the eye . Or the sarariman , in their glasses , and slicked-back hair , their crew cuts , their suits not cut like those of younger men in baggy , Japanese dandy splendor , all paisley and bright colors and impassive and cool black , but blue pinstripes , with lines out of a Sears Roebuck catalog .... And I love it all , the sea of faces , the uncanny resemblances , the hints of foreign genes in the cheekbones or lips or kink of the hair , and yet the singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of happiness coming over me , a calm and combustive joy , a stamping of the feet in my soul , a smile and a voice that says , You are unnoticeable here , you have melded in , you can stand not uttering a word and be one of this crowd , and in each job in this country , there is someone who looks like you , from the emperor to the rock singers , from Nakasone to Kazuo Ono , the great Buto dancer , from the newscaster to the hottest new fashion designer , from the farmer to the man who adjusts robots in the Mitsubishi factory , from the conductor to the schoolteacher , from Oe the novelist to Takemitsu the composer , from the onagata , the female impersonator , to Oh , the former home-run king , all the mothers and fathers and children  --  they look like you , and you are no longer budgeted by your color , parceled out into certain jobs , certain places of nonpower , certain ghettos of the aesthetically backward and unappealing , of the dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> AFTER RETURNING FROM HIROSHIMA FOR THE FIRST TIME , I started to think of where my father was on the day the war ended . By then he had been released from the camp in Jerome , Arkansas , for more than a year and was going to Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo , living with the family of a professor . <p> Probably my father is both pleased and anxious about this precarious new freedom . Perhaps he has looked through the pages of Life or Time , has seen the cartoons depicting the Japanese : they are lice , vermin , tiny thoraxes with huge heads attached , a buck-toothed smile , and squinty eyes behind thick glasses ; they are small , slant-eyed rats squirming under a huge boot of a GI giant smashing down with unfathomable power . Perhaps he has seen the way some of his classmates look at him , casting glances sideways in history or English , as he passes in the halls . Perhaps they whisper loud enough for him to hear . Perhaps not . ( Is he imagining this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date in college . There are no other nisei , none of his kind . Does he admit to himself his desire for the white girls in his classes ? Or is the sexual conflict inside him too dangerous to acknowledge ? <p> It is the year the war has ended , the summer between his junior and senior year . August , a few days after Hiroshima and Nagasaki . A holiday has been declared . Men sweep women up in their arms in the middle of streets and kiss them , and the women , abandoned for a moment , respond ; firecrackers , streamers , confetti , all the trappings of a carnival , whirl through intersections and squares throughout the country . People sport the smiles and laughter of peace , as if the muscles , clenched like a fist for so long , have moved on to another task , all brightness , promise , and plenty . <p> On August 11 , 1946 , my father is sitting on the steps of a house in Kalamazoo , Michigan . He hears the swooping sirens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-school band blaring " Stars and Stripes Forever , " the tooting of horns , loudspeakers filling with speeches . He sees in his mind the street filled with banners and flags , the men with faces bright and beet red from joy and drink , the women yanking their children at the wrist , dabbing their eyes with handkerchiefs . A squirrel comes chittering across the lawn , rears up on its haunches , begging as usual for a handout . My father picks up a stone from the dirt , pulls back his arm , and then drops the stone to his feet . A voice rises inside him , insistent and restless , a twitch in his muscles , an urge to move , go somewhere , do something . " It wo n't always be like this , " he remembers his teacher in the camps saying . " After the war , you will be free again and back in American society . For your own sakes , try and be not one , but two hundred percent American .... " <p> I am American , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The light through the leaves is bright , blinding . The heat immense , oppressive . The sounds all over town joyous . He repeats his mantra over and over . He learns to believe it . <p> MY FATHER NEVER SLEPT WITH A WHITE WOMAN , NEVER , I think , slept with anyone but my mother . Still , I know he must have thought of crossing that line , must have been aware it was there to cross . <p> One fall afternoon in eighth grade , I am home from school with a slight fever . My mother is out shopping . For some reason , I start rummaging in their closet , pushing back the pumps and flats , all lined in a row on the rack , unzipping the garment bags . ( What am I looking for ? Years later , my therapist will tell me that news travels quickly and silently in families ; no one has to speak of it . ) From beneath a stack of folded sweaters , I pull a Playboy magazine . I start moving through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the interview with Albert Schweitzer , with photos of the great man in pith helmet and bow tie , his famous walrus mustache . And then the foldout undoes itself , flowing before me with its glossy shine . <p> I have seen a Playboy someone brought into the locker room at school . But now I am alone , in my parents ' bedroom . I worry about when my mother is coming back ; I forget she is gone . I am entranced by the woman 's breasts ; the aureoles seem as large as my fists . She is blond , eighteen , a UCLA coed . She leans against a screen , half her body exposed to the camera . <p> And so , like many other American boys , I discover my sexuality in the presence of a picture . And , like many other American boys , I do not think of the color of the woman 's skin . Of course , if she were black or brown or yellow .. , but she is white , her beauty self-evident . I sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more prestigious . But the forbidden quality of sex overpowers any thought of race . I do not wonder why my father looks at these pictures , these women who are not my mother . The sensations of pleasure , of momentary possession and shame , flood over me quickly , easily , sliding through my body . <p> A few minutes later , I pick up the magazine , slip it in the garment bag beneath the sweaters . <p> IN ONE OF MY POEMS , THERE IS A LINE ABOUT MY FATHER : " He worked too hard to be white , he beat his son . " Of course , it is more complicated than that . <p> I know that his father , my grandfather , would chase my father around the yard in L.A. , brandishing a two-by-four . Whenever my father referred to this , his manner was surprisingly casual . The beatings were no different than the long distance he had to walk to school or the work he performed in his father 's nursery . They were simply proof that my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to picture my father running from my grandfather , as my grandfather holds his weapon aloft . At a certain moment , the board comes down on flesh , whacks the sweaty , T-shirted back of the young boy , knocking him forward , a flat , dull driving pain , the wind rushing from his lungs , a dizziness of fear , panic , and perhaps relief erupting from his stumbling body . The next blow is harder , more solid ; the thought rises in my father that he can not go on , this ca n't be happening , each blow softened only by the fact that there is one less to go , it will somehow end . <p> But when I try to imagine my father , squirming in his father 's grip , in all likelihood , it is not my father I am seeing , but myself , as my father hovers over me in my room , having read the note from my teacher or having heard from my mother . I 've been bad , have talked too much . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modeled after Zorro 's . The whip comes down ; I do not go limp . I scramble about . The room is small ; he catches me and hauls me on his lap . I 'm held in this vise . I ca n't move , ca n't bear knowing this will happen again and again . <p> SOMEHOW , BEHIND THESE ACTS OF Fathers and sons lies the backdrop of race and relocation . <p> As the war went on , the internees at the Jerome , Arkansas , relocation were given weekend passes . They could travel to Little Rock to eat at a restaurant or watch a movie . My grandfather and grandmother did not go on these trips , only their children . The children spoke English , were enamored of Hollywood 's stars . <p> It is summer , 1942 . On a dust-dry country road , my father waits for the bus with other young nisei . Behind them , like a bad dream , the fences of barbed wire , the rifle towers , the gates , the barracks filled with mothers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with newlyweds . Down the ridge , they can see the shacks of share-croppers , more ramshackle than any of the barracks , with gaps in the walls and their boards weather-beaten and cracked . Rougher , looser than his older brother , Ken  --  less Japanese  --  my father and his friends jostle and joke , talk about the baseball game yesterday , about Carol Hiyama or Judy Endo . These boys frighten some of the issei in camp . They play cards behind the barracks , smoke cigarettes , curse in English . <p> When the bus comes , it is nearly empty . They take their seats in the front , behind an old white woman with a pillbox hat , her purse planted in her lap . Behind them , the anonymous faces of a few Negroes , a couple of men in overalls , a mother and her child with pigtails . There 's never a question for my father of sitting in the back . <p> It is the same at the lunch counter where they order hamburgers and malts . Perhaps they notice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are too engrossed in their own conversation , in teasing Tosh about his crush on Carol , to notice where the Negroes are sitting . Later , these boys will sit below the balcony , below the section for Negroes . The faces of Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn flow off the screen , borne on light , enlarged by glamour and celluloid , becoming part of my father 's dreams . <p> Two years later , he 's in college , away from the camps , entering the Episcopalian church with Professor Bigelow and his family . It is a sunny fall morning , the leaves , splashes of red and yellow and orange , swirling down to the street , crackling on the walk . The church is white , spired , clean in the sunlight . My father has no suit . He 's wearing a white shirt , a tie . It is his first time inside this church . <p> Had my grandfather been a fervent Buddhist , things might have turned out differently . But my grandfather was too much a man of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religions , he had grown away from Buddha and the Shinto gods during his time in America . My father is an empty vessel , waiting to be filled . <p> As he ambles along with the Bigelows , he 's a little stiff , a bit nervous , not knowing what to do . Inside , he 's greeted by streams of light from great stained-glass windows : Christ in the garden of Gethsemane , kneeling in prayer , with the cross of his destruction in the distance , the disciples gathered around him , questioning , listening ; the fish and bread of life , laid out in jagged triangles ; the haggard bearded man stretched out on the cross , eyes closed , giving up the Ghost . What strikes my father more : The beautiful colors or this progression toward suffering ? The light or the dark ? <p> He notices , in front of the benches , a little platform that swings down , cushioned green leather . Just as the children enter the pew , they suddenly kneel down , facing straight ahead toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My father wonders what he should do . Self-conscious , he does the best he can with a halfway gesture , the way seventh graders in our parish later used to bow . The professor smiles and tries to reassure him , but my father , watching the altar boy light the candles on the altar , hearing the organ and the voices of the choir , is again wondering what to do . As the service continues and the members in the pews rise to speak in unison , rise , kneel , over and over at exactly the right time , my father is disoriented . He feels a slight ache in his back , is thankful at least for the cushioned platform . <p> " This is the body and blood which is shed for you and the New Testament . Take this and drink . Do this often in remembrance of me . " <p> Thank god , he thinks , I understand the words . And in all of this , there is a music that takes over my father , something beyond sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of belonging , of crossing some line , a way out of the Buddhist temples and streets of L.A. , something he first felt in the radios and comic books , the very language that poured from his mouth , in the games of mumbletypeg , marbles , and baseball , in the pledge he recited in school each morning . Something that was n't foreign , that did not keep him out . <p> He will convert , he will take up the Cross , he will bring us to church all through my childhood , up until the time we move from our middle-class home in Morton Grove to our upper-class one in Northbrook , a time when he is finally a vice-president , when religion is no longer needed . By then I will be estranged from the Church , an atheist , wondering what brought him to think a white man must be God . <p> GROWING UP , I HAD THE USUAL COMPLAINT OF MOST ASIAN kids about their hard-driving parents . There were never enough excellents , enough hundreds on tests ; there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I missed . When I was seven , my father took me to the sidewalk on Lake Shore Drive and pushed me off on my bike , screamed " Pedal , pedal , " and quickly became disgusted when I fell , yelling that I did n't listen to him . Ten years later , when I learned to drive , it was the same ; sitting beside me in our Buick , he slammed on some imaginary brake in front of him and shook my arm . A terrible teacher , he always ended up screaming and shouting , muttering about my lack of concentration , my refusal to perform . <p> Perhaps the problem was how I took all this . I believed whatever it was that reddened his face , that clenched it so tight , that coiled his fist into a tight ball , must have come from me . I must have created this force ; it was what I deserved . I was simply unable to brush it off . <p> Years later , when I confronted my infidelities , my own harangues at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take my sexuality and the rage it contained and connect it with my father and his rage . The equation did not compute . <p> I see my father now as a successful executive , writing speeches for other executives , writing videos , public-relations campaigns , giving speeches at conventions and meetings , splicing bits of information with familiar corn-pone jokes . I see him in the evening , striding down the fairway in back of his house , shading his eyes as his drive soars into the sun , the tiny white ball disappearing in the last blaze of orange light , the first crickets of evening , gnats scribbling their mad circles around his head . His body looks ten years younger , hardened by weights , by Nautilus , though it has begun to stoop , just a touch , to descend toward earth . He is sixty , he is content , the fairway stretches out before him , he wants no other life than this . He has no problems with identity , with the past , or race . He has been freed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> OCTOBER 12 , 1984 , TOKYO  --  OF COURSE , this is all an illusion ; I am American by birth and tongue and cultural manners , and I will never be a true nihojin ; I will always be outside , but even that seems okay  --  no one told me I should belong here ; in fact , everyone said I would n't , that I would come to love America here , that I would realize how American I am , how deeply rock and roll and football and Whitman and Huck Finn reside within me . <p> Instead , the mirror has shifted . When I see hakujin on the train or in crowds or walking down the street , I think how out of place they look , how awkward , how ungainly and even ugly , how pasty their skin looks , how splotchy , how loud , how coarse , how unfashionable , how " uncool , " how un-Japanese . And yes , they complain of this , of what they do not understand of the manners here , the distance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence of psychology . And I feel like saying , " The power here does not reside in faces like your own , in language like your own , in clothes and food like your own , in metaphysical and religious assumptions like your own , and if there is no sin here and Christ is a funny little man who has decided to grow skinny , and if you worship the nails in his flesh , well , that 's your masochistic trip ; how does it feel to be incomprehensible , to face the incomprehensible , your own ignorance , your own displacement from the center of the world ?
