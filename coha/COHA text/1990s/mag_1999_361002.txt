If you look at most history books , they 'll tell you ENIAC ( for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer ) was the first true all-purpose electronic computer . Unveiled in 1946 in a blaze of publicity , it was a monstrous 30-ton machine , as big as two semis and filled with enough vacuum tubes ( 19,000 ) , switches ( 6,000 ) and blinking lights to require an army of attendants . Capable of adding 5,000 numbers in a second , a then unheard of feat , it could compute the trajectory of an artillery shell well before it landed ( compared with days of labored hand calculations ) . <P> But while this electronic brain , as headline writers called it , took the spotlight , ENIAC had a lot of unsung rivals , many of them shrouded in wartime secrecy . At Bletchley Park , Alan Turing built a succession of vacuum-tube machines called Colossus that made mincemeat of Hitler 's Enigma codes . At Harvard , large , clattering electromechanical computers in IBM 's Mark series also did wartime calculations . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Z electromechanical computers , the last of which was the first general-purpose computer controlled by a program . <P> For years , ENIAC 's principal creators , the late John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert , held the unchallenged title of inventors of the modern computer  --  until an obscure physicist named John Atanasoff came forth to dispute their claims . In the late 1930s , while teaching at Iowa State College , he and a graduate student named Clifford Bell began building a device that would allow them to solve large linear algebraic equations . Their machine , later called ABC ( for Atanasoff Berry Computer ) , incorporated a number of novel features , including the separation of data processing from memory , and relied on binary numbers instead of ENIAC 's clumsier decimal arithmetic . But Atanasoff was called away in 1942 to work for the Navy . Iowa State never filed for patents , and ABC was left abandoned in a storeroom . <P> But not entirely forgotten . In the late 1960s , Sperry Rand , which held the rights to Eckert and Mauchly 's original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had got into the computer business ) for royalty payments . At one point in the six-year litigation , Atanasoff testified that Mauchly cribbed ABC 's key features during a five-day visit in 1941 . Mauchly indignantly denied the accusation . But the judge took a different view . In a 1973 decision that was never appealed , he invalidated Eckert and Mauchly 's patents and in effect declared Atanasoff the winner . Historians , however , interpret the ruling more broadly , viewing it as an effort to keep competition alive in a fast-growing industry . <P> So who did invent the computer ? Novel as it may have been , ABC could not be reprogrammed , did not handle large numbers well and never became fully operational . By contrast , the reprogrammable ENIAC did initial calculations for the H-bomb , kept flashing away for nearly a decade and led to a host of more sophisticated successors . Take your pick . <P>  --  By Frederic Golden
