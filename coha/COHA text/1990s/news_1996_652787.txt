<p> HER NAME IN CHINESE IS rendered Mei Ming , which means No Name . Her cheeks are sunken , and her eyelids are crusted with blisters of neglect . When she cries , the exertion stretches , perilously , the parchmentlike skin of her face . Her hooded eyes refuse to tear . Instead , they are filled with such desperation that when you see the terror in them , then hear the rasping sound that escapes her , you know that death is not far away . <p> Mei Ming lies in a state-run orphanage in Guangdong Province , formerly known as Canton , China 's richest and fastest-developing region . When the six layers of clothes swaddled around her are peeled back by Kate Blewett , a British journalist who , using a false identity , has invaded the orphanage with a crew carrying a hidden camera , the skeletal body of the extremely malnourished child is revealed , proof of the abuse she has suffered . <p> But at whose hands ? <p> " The Dying Rooms , " a 38-minute film made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Channel 4 in Britain and will be seen in the United States for the first time on Cinemax on Wednesday night at 8 . It alleges that the orphanage staff sentenced Mei Ming to death by placing her in a " dying room " 10 days before the damning videotape of her condition was recorded . Her crime , the film makers say , was being born a girl in a society in which a preference for boys is still strong , a society that is under increasing pressure from a childbearing policy that allows only one roll of the biological dice per family . <p> Mei Ming was brought to the orphanage by police officers who had found her abandoned and were delivering her into the state social-welfare system , where she joined countless thousands of castoffs , most of them girls . In this case , however , it is alleged that she was then selected for death by a venal child-welfare bureaucracy in the Communist system . <p> In " The Dying Rooms : A Patchwork of Lies , " a filmed rebuttal produced last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , admitted to the orphanage last year in an extremely malnourished state , with blisters covering his eyelids . The records of the Guangdong orphanage show that the staff fought valiantly to save his life , administering intravenous fluids , vitamins and round-the-clock medical care , the Government says . <p> " Sadly , they could n't save his life , " the rebuttal adds . It then accuses Ms. Blewett of stripping the sick child to bare chest for 20 minutes in a cold room for the purposes of filming , thus further endangering the child 's life . " If this had been her child , " the narrator asks , " would she have left it uncovered ? " ( China has made its filmed rebuttal available through its embassies around the world . Cinemax was not asked to show it and does not plan to . ) <p> These conflicting accounts of Mei Ming 's last days underscore the nature of an information war that has been raging between China and its critics in human-rights organizations since whispers first emerged more than two years ago that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 67 state-run orphanages . <p> " The Dying Rooms " is being shown in the United States just a couple of weeks after Human Rights Watch , the advocacy group based in New York , published a 331-page indictment of China 's child-welfare system . The report , centering largely on the testimony , records and photographs of Dr. Zhang Shuyun , a Chinese physician who served on the staff of the Shanghai Children 's Welfare Institute before leaving China last March , alleges that thousands of children have died in the same manner as Mei Ming : from deliberate starvation , abuse and neglect . <p> Again , the Chinese Government mounted a rebuttal , inviting foreign journalists to visit the Shanghai orphanage and see for themselves that the facility provides a healthy and nurturing environment for the 500 or so children who reside there now . <p> Since the report was published on Jan. 6 , testimonials from American couples who have adopted children in China over the last several years have poured out of fax machines in news bureaus in Beijing . For most of these couples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it seems inconceivable to them that the hands from which they have received the blessing of a child could be guilty of the wretched abuses captured on film and in the documentation of human-rights organizations . <p> Alice A. Jardine , a professor of romance languages and literatures at Harvard University , said in a fax to the Beijing bureau of The New York Times that as a prospective adopting parent of a Chinese girl , she had spent " hundreds of hours " researching China 's program of adoption from state-run orphanages . Her impression from this research , she said , was that " the Chinese Government , and in particular the caretakers in the orphanages in China , are working as hard as is humanly possible in a third-world situation to take care of these thousands of abandoned baby girls . " <p> These contradictions are baffling and disturbing . How in China , where the Communist regime has worked assiduously to reduce infant mortality , improve public health and eradicate illiteracy , could there be such a thing as dying rooms ? <p> Dr. Zhang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades before she left China , said in an interview recently that she had tried to answer this question for herself . " When I was still in China and we were trying to report these abuses to the authorities in the party , " she recalled , " we asked if there was an internal policy to eliminate some babies , and they said : ' No . We have never had such a policy . All babies are a treasure , and every life is valuable . How could we eliminate them ? ' " <p> But this answer did not explain the conditions that Dr. Zhang found in Shanghai and that led her to conclude that because human rights are not enshrined in Chinese culture , no life is guaranteed and human-rights abuses will occur . <p> HAN WEICHENG , A FORMER director of the Shanghai orphanage who has tried to improve cerebral-palsy treatment in China and who has supported China 's participation in the Special Olympics , acknowledged to reporters earlier this month that as many as one-fifth of the orphans under his care in 1989 died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat that winter . But protesting that he has devoted his life to the handicapped , Mr. Han bitterly denied that there had ever been any policy of deliberate starvation in Shanghai . Shown a photograph of an emaciated child tied to a bed , Mr. Han said he recognized the child , but he denied that the child 's malnourished state had been caused by neglect , and he said children were never tied up during his tenure . <p> Despite these rebuttals , there is a growing body of evidence that high mortality rates have afflicted China 's orphan population and that China 's abandoned children are cared for in a system in which neglect and abuse have occurred , perhaps to an alarming extent . " There are shortcomings , " one Communist Party official acknowledged earlier this month . The more serious charge of deliberate starvation in some orphanages has yet to be investigated by any independent body . <p> The importance of the testimony and records smuggled out of China by Dr. Zhang last year is that they document the unnatural deaths of more than 1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often cited as the cause of death " third-degree malnutrition " or " malformation of the brain . " Indeed , malnutrition is cited as the cause of death for 207 of the 400 children who died between November 1991 and October 1992 , Dr. Zhang says . <p> After collaborating on the Human Rights Watch report , she cooperated with the producers of " The Dying Rooms " to produce " Return to the Dying Rooms , " which was broadcast in Britain a couple of weeks ago as a sequel to the original documentary . In the new film , Dr. Zhang 's account of her experiences in Shanghai is used to confirm the allegations of the original film . <p> " A lot of journalists had told us that they had some doubts about the first film , that there was not enough backup for the claims we were making , " Mr. Woods , the " Dying Rooms " co-producer , said in an interview . " But the second film was able to address all these questions , because the Human Rights Watch report has now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a documentary in the style of a narrative quest made by intrepid correspondents and cameramen who enter China under false colors with hidden cameras to prove that the dying rooms do exist . <p> " When we first discussed the story , we all thought that it was important but that it would only work if we could get the evidence of it on film , " Mr. Woods explained . He and his co-producer , Ms. Blewett , set out to sell the idea to Channel 4 , one of Britain 's two independent noncable networks , and then to plot a clandestine journey across great swaths of southern and central China . <p> In some cases they were following up on tips about orphanages with bad reputations . In other cases  --  in the provincial capital Chengdu in Sichuan Province , for example  --  they simply set out by taxi to find a state orphanage , then walked in with a camera hidden in a shoulder bag . In all , they were able to enter a dozen institutions ; scenes from about half are included in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy . In the first orphanage the film makers visited , in Guangxi Province , where they were proceeding on a tip , they found no evidence of such dying children . After much further travel , the crew had to admit that the dying rooms were " more elusive than we had expected " but that " we knew they were out there . " Their discoveries were nonetheless significant as they walked into institutions unannounced and found children lashed to potty benches or suffering from serious neglect in foul-smelling wards . <p> Dr. Zhang says she decided to flee China and seek political asylum in the West after her crusade to expose the orphanage conditions in Shanghai was quashed by senior Communist Party officials concerned that a public airing of such charges would embarrass China . <p> Two weeks ago , Chen Jian , a Foreign Ministry spokesman , said , " Dying rooms do not exist in China , " adding : " It is extremely unfair to pass off part of the story as the entire story and defame China . " Senior Chinese officials in Beijing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government in Beijing refuses to release the large body of orphan-mortality figures that are collected every year by the Ministry of Civil Affairs and classified as secret information . These records could shed light on the total number of China 's orphans and their condition . In the absence of any public accounting , the recent revelations and rebuttals may simply fade without any resolution . <p> It is hard to imagine that China would allow an independent investigation of its state orphanages , whose supervision it considers a strictly internal matter . But even in Shanghai , some party members , lawyers and journalists working inside the system pressed hard for an investigation , and it is conceivable that a groundswell could arise and demand greater accountability , perhaps within China 's National People 's Congress , which meets in March . <p> IN " THE DYING ROOMS , " THE FILM makers provide cut-away commentary from two experts on China . One is Steven W. Mosher of the Claremont Institute , a California research center ; he has written extensively about China 's population control program and asserts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of China . " <p> For anyone who has traveled in China , as Mr. Mosher has , this statement should set off alarm bells . Family planning and population control are concepts that a large number of Chinese willingly support . Of course there is opposition to the one-child policy and even hatred of it , but a large portion of China 's 1.2 billion people profess a willingness to sacrifice their desire to have a boy or a second or third child to the greater goal of population control . Mr. Mosher 's enthusiasm for overstatement has prompted Beijing to brand him a less-than-objective analyst of Chinese social affairs . But his basic point  --  that the preference for boys in Chinese culture , with the pressure of the one-child policy , has led to the death and abandonment of countless infant girls  --  is supported by a number of authorities . <p> The other expert consulted by the film makers was Jonathan Mirsky , the respected Hong Kong correspondent of The Times of London . After he filed trenchant dispatches during and after the Tiananmen massacres of 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainland . The makers of " The Dying Rooms " offer no commentary from any China scholar or expert who might be regarded as a slightly more neutral observer . " Those were the only ones who were prepared to take part in the program , " Mr. Woods said , referring to Mr. Mosher and Mr. Mirsky . " No one else of the many people we contacted would go on , and they all said the same thing : they were afraid that if they were linked in any way to the film , they would never get a visa into China again . " <p> The main concession to balance in the program is a visit to a private orphanage in Wuhan , where a nurturing staff is filmed tending to the revels of happy children . " Some people in China do care for abandoned children , " the narrator says . But viewers are not offered any comments from the private-orphanage staff that might help make sense of the differences between public and private attitudes toward orphans . <p> The final segment of the film is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( At first the crew thought the orphanage was empty until a towel draped across a cot " started to cry , " Ms. Blewett says . ) Compelling images of neglect were captured on tape at this orphanage , and the rebuttal offered by the Government did not succeed in addressing the poor condition of the infants found on the day of the film crew 's visit . And in the room where Mei Ming lay alone , there was no sign of an intravenous drip or medicine trays or anything else that might have supported the rebuttal film 's contention that she had received intensive care . <p> Just for the record , said Mr. Woods , Mei Ming was a girl .
