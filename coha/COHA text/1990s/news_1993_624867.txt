<p> Do not expect a ruling on the Wilber Marshall situation before the middle or latter part of next week . Commissioner Paul Tagliabue returns to the office from his vacation in China on June 21 . Considering everything that is going on in the NFL , the Oilers-Redskins controversy probably wo n't be his top priority even though Washington is pushing for a quick resolution . <p> After talking with Oilers and Redskins insiders and several general managers around the league , there are different theories about what will happen . <p> First , it is obvious to almost everyone but the Redskins , Marshall and agent Richard Bennett  --  and deep down they know it , too  --  that they do not have a trade . A trade is n't official until the NFL is notified , and the league office never was notified . <p> Operating on owner Bud Adams ' instructions , Oilers general counsel Steve Underwood told Redskins general manager Charley Casserly that the deal was dead . Case closed . <p> After Underwood talked to Casserly , Bennett faxed Marshall 's acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sources around the league , Adams ' withdrawal nullified any deal with Marshall . <p> The only reason the Oilers are being criticized around the league is because Adams had a deal for first- and fifth-round picks for more than a month , and then he backed out at the last minute . <p> The Oilers were involved in a similar situation in 1986 . <p> Former general manager Ladd Herzeg had agreed to trade quarterback Jim Everett , the Oilers ' unsigned No. 1 pick , to Green Bay . After Herzeg agreed to the deal , the Los Angeles Rams made a better offer . <p> Herzeg reneged on the deal with the Packers and sent Everett to the Rams in a trade that ended up bringing such players as William Fuller , Haywood Jeffires , Sean Jones and Spencer Tillman to Houston . <p> Packers coach Forrest Gregg blasted Herzeg and asked the league to intervene , but the NFL said the trade was not official . <p> Sources around the league say Tagliabue might tell the Redskins and Oilers to work it out themselves . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a go-between for Adams and Washington owner Jack Kent Cooke . <p> If that happens and Adams is interested , Redskins sources say they will take the No. 1 pick to complete the trade and let the Oilers keep the fifth-round selection . <p> Three general managers say they believe the reason Adams backed out of the deal was n't money or the fifth-round pick but the No. 1 draft choice . <p> Under the new system , first-round picks come cheap compared to previous years , and every owner is thinking long and hard about parting with them . <p> There is one sure way for the Oilers to get Marshall . If the Redskins will take less than a No. 1 pick , Marshall will play for the Oilers . The Redskins privately have said that wo n't happen , but a club source says it 's a possibility if they can get another outside linebacker . <p> If there is a top outside linebacker from another team who has been protected as a transitional player and he becomes an unrestricted free agent Monday because his team does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million this season , the Redskins might pursue him . The Giants ' Carl Banks is a possibility . <p> The Marshall controversy should come down to this : If Adams does n't want to make the trade , it wo n't be made . If he wants to make it for a No. 1 pick , Marshall probably will be coming to Houston . <p> Denver made a miscalculation when it told Pro Bowl inside linebacker Michael Brooks it was not going to tender him the minimum offer of almost $ 2.2 million , which made him an unrestricted free agent . The Broncos wanted to sign him for less money , but he signed with the Giants and former coach Dan Reeves for $ 5.5 million over three years . <p> Keith Traylor , the heir apparent , became a free agent last week . It was a mutual parting of the ways . <p> Denver sources say Traylor , who has had alcohol-related problems off the field , left the Betty Ford Clinic early and went home to Arkansas . The Broncos were angry and fed up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent , found out his client earned a playing-time incentive because of playing special teams . The agent said the incentive nullified the option year of Traylor 's contract and he should be a free agent . The Broncos agreed . <p> Despite his problems , several teams are interested in Traylor . <p> The Broncos are trying to replace him by trying to sign Dave Wyman from Seattle . Right now , Denver 's inside starters should be Karl Mecklenburg and either Jeff Mills , an untested reserve , or Wyman . <p> The Oilers are intereted in signing outside linebacker Jessie Small , an unrestricted free agent from Phoenix who played for defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan and linebackers coach Ronnie Jones in Philadelphia . <p> The Eagles drafted Small in the second round in 1989 . He started until he lot the job to William Thomas from Texas A &M.; Small signed with Phoenix as a Plan B free agent last year . The Crdinals are trying to re-sign him , but he wants to play for Ryan and Jones . <p> Small , who weighs 245 , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . Ryan is not happy with Lathon 's performance in the off-season and could be running out of patience with the former No. 1 pick . <p> Buffalo outside linebacker Darryl Talley plans to own a McDonald 's when he retires . During the offseason , he worked at a McDonald 's as part of the company 's owner/operator internship program . <p> " " Being in the drive-thru is like playing against the run-and-shoot , " Talley says . " " There 's no winning . The only thing you can do is hope you can survive through it and make enough plays . <p> " " Ideally what I 'd like to do is start off with one store and run it and have it highly efficient , " he says . " " Once you have one and everything starts rolling along , then you can say , " OK , now I can take that next step .

It is doubtful the Eagles would trade Joyner , especially to a division rival , but they also know he plans to leave after next season . <p> The NFL Players Association says Green Bay has the highest payroll in the league at $ 41 million and that half of the teams in the league will be over the estimated salary cap of $ 30 million to $ 32 million that should go into effect in 1994 . <p> Privately , the Bills are laughing because Pro Bowl offensive tackle Will Wolford , who signed with Indianapolis , had to undergo surgery on an injured rotator cuff . There is talk around the league Wolford might be forced to miss the season , which the Colts deny . <p> The Colts also say they knew about the injury before they signed Wolford for $ 2 million per year . <p> Sources say the Raiders are going to waive running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Atlanta is interested in Dickerson <p> By the last year of the new collective bargaining agreement in 1999 , a player 's share for winning the Super Bowl will increase from $ 64,000 to $ 110,000 . Players playing on the winning Pro Bowl team will get $ 25,000 and losers $ 15,000 , an increase from $ 10,000 and $ 5,000 <p> The Bengals were not happy with No. 1 pick John Copeland at their minicamp after the defensive tackle showed up with a stomach larger than they wanted to see . " " It 's apparent John has spent more time celebrating being a No. 1 draft pick than he has preparing for his first Bengals season , " coach David Shula said <p> The popular preseason choice to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl seems to be San Diego with Miami and Kansas City close behind . The Oilers and Bills , the hot picks last year , are nowhere to be found . <p> NOTES : " " John McClain covers the Oilers and the NFL for the Chronicle . His notebook appears on Sundays @ @
