Hard by the runways of Los Angeles International Airport stands a Hughes Electronics factory called High Bay . The reason for the name is immediately apparent : The brightly lit space is five stories high from floor to ceiling . The factory is unusual in other ways  --  no assembly lines , no conveyor belts , and no grinding machine tools . Workers gather around a half dozen shiny objects as if before totems : High Bay is where Hughes finishes satellites before launching them into space . Most of the satellites , like the one along the south wall that will handle international calls to and from Brazil , are old-fashioned " spinners "  --  squat cylinders that rotate in space for stability , like gyro scopes . But the star of High Bay is a 14-foot cube suspended against the long north wall : model HS-601 , a so-called body-stabilized satellite that has the spinning section hidden inside its core . With it , Hughes hopes to transform the television industry , and itself . Hughes , a subsidiary of General Motors , is bidding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cable TV industries . The first satellite is scheduled for launch in December from French Guiana on an Ariane rocket . Together with a twin also under construction , it will beam 150 channels of movies , cable TV programs , and sporting events directly to anyone in the U.S. or Canada with a special satellite dish and decoder initially priced at $700  --  far less than conventional satellite dishes , which cost up to $3,500 . The new dish wo n't be one of those ten-footers that mar the landscape of rural America , either . It 's only 18 inches across  --  small enough to mount on the side of your house or even park right on the buffet , if your buffet happens to be near a south-facing window . Hughes 's new DirecTv unit will market the service straight to the customer , just like a cable TV company , and for a comparable monthly fee . If all goes well , programs will start beaming earthward next spring . While most people are n't yet aware of the technology  --  known as direct broadcast satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the cable TV business . Industry experts say Hughes has been a galvanizing force , driving cable TV and telephone companies to embrace digital compression technology , which translates video images into computer language and eliminates detail that does n't change from one frame to the next , letting the cable carry many more channels . However fast cable TV companies scramble , DirecTv 's 150 channels should outdo what they can offer widely for several years at least . The large cable companies are experimenting with systems that can provide hundreds of channels , but only in limited areas . Some of the smaller cable operators , of which there are hundreds , may never be able to afford the fiber-optic cable network necessary to transmit so many channels . Even if Hughes does n't snare a lot of current cable customers , it has a natural constituency : the million or so U.S. households still beyond the reach of cable TV . Hughes 's brace of satellites , which will be parked in geostationary orbit 22,300 miles above the earth , are stirring a geopolitical tempest as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all those channels of U.S. programming that the Toronto Globe and Mail and the Ottawa Sun , among others , routinely refer to the DBS satellite as " the Death Star . " DBS should n't be confused with the TV pictures people get now by plucking network and cable company feeds from the sky . Because the Hughes DBS system is digital , it will deliver clear pictures and CD-quality sound . Since the signals will be compressed , the satellites can handle many more channels than existing communications satellites . These use uncompressed analog technology , so it takes 30 of them to carry the quotidian U.S. traffic . Today 's home satellite dishes are motorized to let them sweep the sky to pick up different programs , which is why they are so expensive . The old satellites are also low powered , so the dishes must be large to capture an intelligible signal . What 's more , dish owners are having a harder time getting free programming these days . Cable companies are scrambling their satellite feeds to thwart them , and as sports stadiums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitted by wire instead of by satellite . Hughes 's gamble is a fascinating  --  and risky  --  attempt by a hard-core technology company to turn itself into an entertainment company . About $1 billion is riding on the nose cones of the launching rockets , and the hurdles do n't stop there . First , Hughes 's business plan depends on shifting the heaviest capital burden-the cost of the satellite dishes and decoder boxes-onto the customer . That may work with people in rural areas , where existing satellite dishes are so costly . But to be a megastar , DirecTv must do respectably in markets already served by cable . That $700 will seem like a lot to someone used to getting a TV-top box for free as part of basic cable service . ( Of course , it 's not really free ; the cost is built into the monthly rate . ) If Hughes fails to penetrate the cable strongholds , it must be ready to change its strategy , perhaps offering to rent dishes and decoders in some markets-which could ratchet up the company 's capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable and telephone companies do roll out their information highways and start sending streams of video over them , Hughes 's advantage of extra programming will vanish . Next year , for example , Time Warner , parent of FoRTUNE 's publisher , hopes to begin a five-year , $5 billion push to build an advanced system , but will need three or four years to reach half its seven million subscribers ; at the end of the five years , about 15% of them still will not be served by the new system . While Hughes will be able to offer lots more pay-per-view movies than cable in the meantime  --  which it considers a big selling point  --  it will eventually be at a disadvantage . Unlike the cable systems , the satellites wo n't have the capacity to offer video on demand , which will let customers order movies from a catalogue whenever they wish . Third : Another selling point with prospective viewers , including existing cable customers , will be so-called out-of-market sports programming : single-game and season tickets to professional sports matches that take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to solidify any deals with the sports leagues , and if it does , nothing will prevent cable companies from negotiating similar arrangements  --  once they beef up the channel capacity of their systems so they can handle the extra traffic . Finally , Hughes will face other satellite competitors . On July 26 , Tele-Communications Inc. , the largest U.S. cable TV operator , announced that it had ordered two high-powered satellites from Loral of New York City and will use them to deliver digital programming to its cable systems around the country and direct to viewers at home . That will let TCI broaden its reach quickly without a lot of rewiring costs . The TCI satellites wo n't be launched until June and October of 1996 , though , so Hughes will have a jump of more than two years . The project began eight years ago , when the FCC set aside part of the radio spectrum for TV programs to be beamed directly to viewers . Satellites would be assigned designated parking spaces ; Hughes applied for one of only three spots from which a satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can accommodate several satellites . ) But digital compression was not in the lexicon then , and satellites were more primitive . Hughes would have had to launch four satellites to get just 32 channels of TV , and it could n't figure out how to make the investment pay . So it waited . In recent years , DBS satellites have revolutionized communications overseas , even though no service offers more than a handful of channels . Since 1986 , Rupert Murdoch has been challenging the state television authorities of Europe with his British Sky Broadcasting telecasts . One satellite launched by Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong began beaming signals  --  Star TV  --  into China and other Asian countries in 1991 , and thousands of dishes bloomed . But Murdoch , who just bought control of Star TV , and Hutchison have the luxury of competing where relatively few TV channels are available to viewers even now . In the U.S. , while satellites have become the main medium for distributing programs to local TV stations and cable operators , attempts to start satellite services that broadcast directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several Hollywood studios , including Paramount and MCA , backed a satellite pay-per-view movie service called TVN Entertainment in 1991 . But it signed up only 100,000 customers , perhaps because it offered only ten channels of movies and no TV shows , and viewers needed to buy a large satellite dish too . Last year the studios pulled their backing because they were n't getting enough of a return . TVN survives , but it 's struggling . Catered to by entrenched broadcast and cable industries , Americans are n't exactly starved for viewing entertainment . Something else would have to happen before DBS could succeed . The first 6,000-pound DBS satellite , now almost completed , is crammed with stuff : power amplifiers , radio wave propagators , titanium fuel tanks , navigational gear , explosive charges for deploying solar panels , azure-blue glass solar cells , thruster jets , antennas . Workers peer inside , one of them prone on a raised forklift platform that edges him closer and closer as if he were docking with the satellite in space . The solar panels have just been attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satellite , the other partly open . In a few days the panels will be fully extended to check the springs that will deploy them in space . That will be the only chance for human eyes to see the satellite in the glory of its 86-foot wingspan . The anticipation in the room is palpable . The combination of great stakes , exotic technology , and painstaking effort by many people , culminating in a single event that may bring the instant and total disaster of launch failure  --  three of the 58 Ariane launches so far have failed  --  is what makes satellite building the most tension-laden manufacturing industry in the world . Once testing is finished , how will the satellite get to French Guiana ? Why , by UPS or Federal Express . " They 'll ship it down overnight , " says communications director Tom Bracken . When each spacecraft reaches its orbital slot , a command from the control center on earth will detonate explosive charges , shearing off bolts and releasing the springs . Thermal blankets protecting the sunward face of the satellite from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wrap stuck to the satellite with Velcro . Pulling together a handful of technological breakthroughs has brought Hughes to the edge of success . In the world 's first major application of video digital compression technology , Hughes will at least quadruple the capacity of satellite transponders . A transponder receives a radio signal from an earth station and then rebroadcasts it on a designated frequency . A single satellite can carry up to 32 transponders , depending on the design . Each can handle many telephone calls simultaneously , but only one video program  --  until recently . Digital compression will let the 16 transponders on each Hughes satellite transmit several channels of video at the same time  --  initially four or five but eventually up to ten each . After the stream of programming signals from an earth station reaches the satellite , the transponders generate radio waves for broadcast and bounce the signals back . Since the signals will be digital , the TV-top decoder boxes will be able to translate them into nearly flawless sound and image as long as they are discernible when they reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfected the design for a high-powered satellite that enables the receiving dishes to shrink to a more palatable size . A spinner satellite is stable and reliable , but inherently inefficient . Its solar cells are arrayed around the circumference of the cylinder ; because it rotates continuously , only about a third of the cells face the sun at a time . The newer body-stabilized satellites , introduced by Hughes in 1987 , hold a constant pose . Once the solar panels unfold they face sunward 24 hours a day , generating far more power . The signal strength from spinners is typically ten watts per transponder ; those on an HS-601 will broadcast at 120 watts each . The higher power means a smaller dish will suffice . To avoid a marketing nightmare , Hughes wants everyone to be able to use the same size dish . Normally signal strength varies with distance from the satellite , making larger dishes necessary as the signal weakens . Heavy rainfall also attenuates signal strength . Hughes must make sure that its signals will be of comparable strength wherever they are received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two meticulously engineered reflector antennas mounted on the satellite give the signal shape , focusing more power on rainier and more distant regions . Fancy as they are , each of the $200 million satellites is really a data pump in the sky that catches a radio signal from a single point on the ground and sprays it back nationwide , like the batter in a game of pepper , except here the ball goes not to one player at a time but to everyone at once . Much of the intelligence in the Hughes system will live atop each subscribers TV . Housed in the decoder box will be a special MPEG ( for Motion Picture Experts Group , a standard-setting body ) chip that decompresses the signal and translates it into sound and image . The box also has a slot for a " smart card " with subscriber information on an embedded chip , and an outlet for plugging in a telephone line . To activate service , viewers must insert the card into the box and leave it there . A signal travels from the box via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verifying that the box has not been stolen or otherwise moved from its assigned address . The box also keeps track of each customer 's pay-per-view selections ; once a month a kind of E.T . memory chip will automatically phone home to the billing center with a list of charges . The RCA division of Thomson , which is developing the electronics along with Murdoch 's News Corp. , has exclusive rights to make the boxes and the antennas for 18 months or until it sells a million units , whichever comes first . Then other manufacturers will start making the gear under license , and the price should start coming down . Viewers will buy the boxes and dishes in electronics stores . For a July satellite industry trade show in Nashville , DirecTV brought along 1,000 applications for dealers interested in selling the dishes  --  enough , the company thought , for the three-day show . They were gone within 3-1/2 hours . The proof will be in the viewing . DirecTv will serve up a mix of familiar and novel programming . It has signed deals with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will charge customers around $18 to $25 a month , depending on how many stations they order . ( They may choose to order none if all they want to see is pay-per-view movies or sports . ) Hubbard Broadcasting of Minneapolis will also be signing up DBS viewers . That company has long held the rights to five of the 32 transmission frequencies in Hughes 's orbital slot and will buy the corresponding transponders on the Hughes birds . Most of Hubbard 's programming will be premium cable channels like Showtime and HBO . Hughes will try to steal a march on cable company plans to inundate viewers with the fruit of Hollywood by serving up 50 to 60 channels of pay-per-view movies . The most popular titles will start every 15 minutes . Viewers who are interrupted in the middle of a film will be able to surf over to a later showing on another channel and pick up the action at no extra charge . So far DirecTv has signed deals with Paramount , Universal , and Columbia TriStar for current films , and with Turner Broadcasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release like Sleepless in Seattle will cost $4 , a classic such as The Big Sleep just $1 . DirecTv also hopes to lure fans from cable TV systems by carrying up to 40 channels of sports programming  --  enough to broadcast every professional game played at any given moment , and then some . A Mets fan marooned in Los Angeles will thus be able to wallow in futility all summer long . Single games will cost $2 to $6 , depending on the sport . A season ticket may go for $150 . Using the telephone hookup to the decoder boxes , Hughes will be able to black out games for subscribers who live in areas covered by existing telecast agreements . On quiet evenings and during the day , some of the sports channels will carry movies instead . Hughes is negotiating the deals now , but the leagues worry that showing a lot of out-of-town games may hurt the audience for home games . " We 've made no decision , " says Doug Kirk , manager of business development for NBA Television Ventures . Eddy Hartenstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I fully expect to have sports deals done with all the leagues by the end of this year , " he says . Since its satellite will cast a wide net , DirecTv will troll for people interested in relatively specialized fare  --  Canadian news , for example . DirecTv also wants to air cultural events such as Broadway shows or rock concerts for $15 to $30 each . The box would black out the broadcast to subscribers living near the event . Hartenstein says , " Artists ranging from Sinatra to the Grateful Dead to Sonic Youth would all have a tremendous opportunity to bump up their grosses without hurting their gate . " What you wo n't find on the satellite is programming that would satisfy certain less esoteric desires  --  for example , the Robin Byrd Show , which features dance artistes of various genders ( " She probably has an audience , " says Hartenstein , " but we 're also part of GM " ) , or the Ugly George Show , in which the host roams the streets of New York City asking young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " He sent us a demo tape . It 's still in the bottom of my drawer . " Before becoming an arbiter of taste , Hartenstein was a physicist and satellite jock . In the 1970s he was a mission planner for the Viking and Voyager spacecraft programs at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and NASA . But when he was a kid in Los Angeles , his parents owned a Swiss restaurant . " That 's the ultimate customer-oriented business , " he says . " If we 're successful here , we 'll have a relationship with ten million customers with a menu they can serve up to themselves . " The customers had better have a big appetite . The nearly $1 billion cost of getting the service up and running includes that $200 million for each of the two satellites plus a spare in case of a launch disaster , $100 million for each launch and insurance , and $50 million for the control center in Castle Rock , Colorado . If the first two satellites make it , Hughes will eventually launch the third for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100 million . The National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative of Herndon , Virginia , which finances telephone systems in thinly populated areas , will invest $250 million in return for some of the programming revenue . Hughes will put up the remaining $600 million or so . The big question for Hughes : How long does it have before the cable TV and telephone giants build megasystems that will make 150 channels seem like chicken feed ? Paramount Pictures video division President Robert Klingensmith thinks Hughes will have enough time to make a big profit . He says : " They 're years ahead of what 's going to be available on any electronic superhighway . They are extremely levelheaded . They really have their stuff together . " Hartenstein says that Hughes will break even if by the end of the decade it has three million customers spending $25 to $30 a month . He expects to have three times that many . ( Nearly four million Americans now own the big satellite dishes , and 42% of them live in areas served by cable . ) Nothing is forever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will last about 12 years , depending on how well the ground technicians play a high-stakes electronic game . Each satellite must stay within a 40-square-mile zone . The force of the solar wind will cause the satellites to drift slowly . So every two weeks the thruster jets must fire to bring them back where they belong . The better the engineers play the game , the longer the fuel , and the birds , will last . After the dozen years are up , will it pay Hughes to put up more satellites ? Hartenstein says he does n't have a big enough crystal ball to know what will happen beyond the year 2000 , but if Hughes has ten million customers , it will probably relaunch . Even if it does n't , Hartenstein and Hughes will have played an intriguing part in the communications revolution . Associate director Andy Lippmann of MIT 's Media Lab says , " You 've got to give credit to Hughes for being a motivator . The other distribution channels have to make the transition to digital TV much more quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big players in the communications business to look over their shoulders . <p>
