Seventh in a series <p> Highly aggressive gamefish , New York 's true bass are extremely popular with many anglers . From bank fishing along lake tributaries to surf casting on Long Island 's beaches , true bass provide anglers with a diversity of fishing opportunity . <p> Also called temperate bass , true bass live in a variety of habitats . Large and small lakes , rivers , estuaries ( water bodies open to the sea ) and nearshore ocean are all home to one or more species of these bass . True bass are found in waters with a salt content ranging from fresh to full seawater , and two species  --  the white perch and striped bass  --  can easily move between fresh and saltwater . <p> True bass are distinct in appearance . They are generally silvery white in color and most have dark horizontal lines along their sides . True bass are spiny-rayed fish with strong spines in their dorsal ( back ) , anal ( bottom rear ) and pelvic ( bottom front ) fins . They have two separate  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While many people think true bass are relatives of the smallmouth and largemouth bass , they are not . Smallmouth and largemouth bass are black bass , which are actually members of the sunfish family . True bass and black bass not only differ in appearance , but also in habitat requirements and spawning behavior . Spawning <p> True bass spawn or reproduce in the spring . Adult bass migrate into rivers or shallow water areas of lakes to disperse their eggs . They are broadcast spawners , simply releasing the eggs into the water . Eggs hatch quickly  --  within two to four days . Unlike other fish , such as black bass , true bass do not build nests and do not provide parental care for the young . <p> True bass release a tremendous number of eggs during spawning . A single female striped bass has been known to release as many as four million eggs ! This huge number of eggs makes up for the lack of parental care and helps make sure enough young fish survive .

White bass are especially known to herd schools of baitfish to the surface . The bass then attack in a " feeding frenzy , " often forcing the baitfish to jump out of the water . Fishing <p> True bass are among some of the most exciting freshwater fish species in New York State . Ranging in size from six to 55 inches , these bass can provide fishing opportunity for all kinds of anglers . <p> As a group , true bass are aggressive gamefish and put up a good fight when hooked . During feeding they will often strike just about anything you put in the water . If anglers locate one of these feeding concentrations , fishing action can be fast and furious . <p> At one time , several species of true bass were important commercial fish species . However , restrictions on the amount of fish that could be taken along with declines in their catch and their market value have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species of true or temperate bass and one hybrid are found in New York 's waters ; striped bass , white perch , white bass and hybrid bass . A brief description of each is provided in the chart . Persons interested in finding more detailed descriptions for any member of the temperate bass family can refer to The Freshwater Fishes of Canada by W.B. Scott and EJ . Crossman and The Inland Fishes of New York State by C. Lavett Smith . Striped Bass <p> Striped bass are very important sport and commercial fish in the United States . Their speed , power , and large size make them one of the most exciting sportfish . Known as New York 's accessible giant , striped bass in the 50-pound range are taken every year . <p> Striped bass or " stripers " are the largest of New York 's temperate basses . They are easily distinguished by the seven to nine dark horizontal lines found along their sides  --  two to three of which extend from the head to the base of the tail . Unlike white bass or white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depth of the body generally less than the head length . In addition , striped bass have two patches of teeth on the tongue . <p> Striped bass are found in both fresh and salt water . They generally occur around rocks and wrecks in nearshore waters , rivers and large reservoirs . Striped bass are found along the Atlantic Coast from the St. Lawrence River in Canada to the St. Johns River in Florida . In New York State , they are found seasonally in the tidal portion of the Hudson River and coastal waters around Long Island . <p> Stripers are migratory fish . In the ocean , they move north in the summer and south in the fall and winter . Striped bass found along the mid-Atlantic coast are produced in the Hudson and Delaware rivers , the Chesapeake Bay system and the Roanoke River . Hudson River striped bass are most commonly found between New Jersey and Cape Cod . However , they can travel as far away as North Carolina and Nova Scotia . <p> Striped bass vary considerably in size  --  ranging from 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in weight . They are slow to mature and are long-lived . In New York , female stripers do not mature until five to eight years old and fish 25 years old have been caught in the Hudson River . <p> Smaller striped bass , in the 10- to 20-pound range , generally travel in large schools . Older and larger fish are usually in small " pods " of only a few fish . Adult striped bass are voracious feeders , primarily eating fish and invertebrates , especially crabs and squid . <p> Striped bass are anadromous  --  migrating to freshwater from the sea to spawn . Spawning takes place in the Hudson River estuary in May and early June . Stripers broadcast their eggs near the surface over deep water that has some current or turbulence . The semi-buoyant eggs drift with the current and hatch in two to four days . By early summer , young striped bass move to shallow water nursery areas of Haverstraw Bay and the Tappan Zee . In early fall they begin to move out of the estuary to nearshore coastal areas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other striped bass migrating along the Atlantic Coast . <p> Striped bass are a favorite of many New York anglers . Since stripers are known to occur around rocky areas near jetties and dropo-ffs where there is some current or turbulence , anglers should concentrate their efforts there . Many of these areas can be found by studying a good set of navigation charts . Best fishing is around high tide in the evening , at night or on overcast days . <p> Anglers use a variety of methods and tackle to catch these incredible fighters . On the Hudson River , striped bass fishing is best during the spring spawning run from March to June . During the early spring when water temperatures are cooler ( about 50 degrees Farenheit ) and the bass are less active , bottom fishing on slow drifts with blood worms provides some success . As the water warms up ( above 56 degrees Farenheit ) , trolling with lures such as jointed plugs or bait is the most effective method for catching Hudson River stripers . Although boat fishing provides the best catches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plugs retrieved on a fast cast may catch a striper warming itself in shallow water areas during high tides . <p> In saltwater , boat anglers catch the most stripers by trolling or controlled drifting using large plugs or spoons or fresh cut bait or eels . For surf fishing along Long Island , casting plugs , spoons or jigs may produce good catches . Surf casters should fish on a moving tide . <p> Striped bass have been a valuable commercial fish species in New York State . Unfortunately , striped bass from New York were found to contain polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB 's ) . Levels were highest in bass from the Hudson River and in 1976 the state banned their scale . PCB levels have dropped significantly since then , but remain above the federal action level of two ppm . The presence of PCB 's also led to a ban in the 1980 's on the sale of striped bass from the marine waters around Long Island . This has been partially lifted and a limited fall commercial fishery is now permitted . White Perch <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perch are the smallest members of New York 's true bass . They are easily told apart from other true bass because white perch have no dark stripes and no patches of teeth on their tongues . <p> Like striped bass , white perch can live in both fresh and saltwater . Although white perch prefer brackish waters , they also live in rivers , lakes and reservoirs . They often occur in large schools in turbid shallow areas . They are rapidly expanding their range in the state and can be found in the Hudson River and its tributaries south of Troy , small lakes east of the Hudson , fresh and brackish waters of Long Island , the Seneca River and Mohawk River systems , Oneida and Chautauqua lakes and in Lake Erie , Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River . <p> White perch are prolific breeders .

Eggs hatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insects while older perch feed mostly on fish . <p> White perch are tasty fish with white , flaky flesh . At one time , they were an important commercial species in New York . Today , their large numbers and catchability make them popular panfish . Although small in size , they can put up a good fight when hooked . White perch are especially easy to catch in the spring during spawning . They can be caught by still fishing with worms or grubs or hy casting small flies or lures . Best catches are taken at dusk or after dark . White Bass <p> Strictly a freshwater species , white bass have a limited distribution in New York State . They are medium-sized ( nine to 15 inches long ) and sporty fish that are a favorite of local anglers . <p> White bass occur in the open water habitat of large lakes and reservoirs as well as some large streams and rivers . They prefer clear water over firm bottom and usually travel in large schools . Sometimes confused with striped bass , white bass can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the tongue . In addition , white bass have only one of their dark stripes run the entire body length from head to tail . <p> Spawning takes place in tributary streams , nearshore areas and over shoals . Female white bass release their eggs near the water surface . The eggs sink and attach to rocks , sticks and bottom vegetation and hatch within two to four days . <p> White bass are fast-growing predators . Individuals up to 17 inches long and nine years of age have been taken in Oneida Lake . White perch are known for feeding at the surface in large schools . They primarily eat insects and fish . <p> White bass are locally popular sportfish . Their aggressive nature and schooling tendency make them one of the easiest fish to catch . The best fishing is in the spring when schools of white bass move inshore . Casting or trolling streamer flies , jigs , spinners and spoons or still fishing with minnows will produce good catches . Since white bass often feed near the surface , be sure to keep lures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cross between striped bass and white bass . They were originally developed to provide large sportfish that have the fighting quality of striped bass and feed on open water prey fish . Hybrid bass are stocked in waters with large populations of forage fishes and do not appear to compete with sunfishes or black bass . Hybrid bass are stocked in three waters in New York : Whitney Point Reservoir in Broome County , Swinging Bridge Reservoir in Sullivan County and Fort Pond in Suffolk County . <p> Hybrid bass are similar in appearance to both parents . They have two patches of teeth on their tongues like striped bass , but are deep-bodied like white bass . The dark stripes found on hybrid bass are usually broken into short dashes . <p> Hybrid bass are most often produced from a female striped bass and a male white bass . The young grow well in the hatchery and are usually stocked in the fall as fingerlings . <p> Hybrid bass are fast growers . In New York , hybrids reach eight inches in length in the first year and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in open waters and primarily eat forage fish such as alewife and gizzard shad . <p> Hybrid bass are popular sportfish . They are hard fighting and good eating . Anglers use the same fishing methods as those for white bass . <p> The future of hybrid bass in New York is uncertain . Although the fish are doing well in the state 's waters , anglers have not learned how to catch them consistently . Hybrids also have shown the trait of moving downstream from reservoirs into waters where they may not be wanted . However , hybrid bass have only been in New York for a short time ( since the 1980s ) and they may prove to be an exciting addition to New York 's fishery . True Bass and People <p> Fish that move through and are caught in territorial waters of more than one state or nation are often managed by interstate or international agreements . The Atlantic coastal stock of striped bass is one such species and a good example of interstate cooperation at its best . <p> The Atlantic coastal population is made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest contribution comes from the Chesapeake system , followed by the Hudson River . High market demand in the early 1970 's led to a record catch of striped bass in 1973 . Fishing was especially intense for the Chesapeake stocks , both in the bay and along the coast . Consequently , overfishing occurred and the Chesapeake stocks collapsed in the mid to late 1970 's . The collapse affected anglers coastwide . <p> In response to this decline , Atlantic Coastal states formed a work group under the leadership of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission , an interstate management agency . This group included representatives from 12 states as well as the Potomac River Fisheries Commission , the District of Columbia , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service . A coastal striped bass management plan was completed in 1981 which included a variety of harvest restrictions . Several plan amendments and very restrictive harvest regulations followed including increasing the minimum size limit of coastal striped bass up to 38 inches and reducing the number of fish anglers could keep to only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay was totally eliminated . <p> By the late 1980s , the cooperation and sacrifices of anglers , including those in New York , began to pay off . Striped bass production in the Chesapeake and abundance along the coast began to increase and limited fishing was once again allowed . <p> The Hudson River striped bass stock also benefitted from the restrictive harvest regulations . Their abundance stayed stable through the 1970s and today is at the highest level in years .

Eileen Stegemann is a writer and editor in DEC 's bureau of publications who specializes in writing about fish and fisheries management . <p> Scientific Names <p> Many species of fish look alike , making it difficult to tell them apart . In addition , many types of fish have different common names in different parts of the country . To distinguish one organism from another , biologists give each a scientific name that is unique to that organism . The names are derived from the Latin language and consist of a genus and a species . The genus name is first and is capitalized . The species name is second and is in lower case . Both the genus . and species are either underlined or italicized when written . While several organisms in the same " family " share a common genus name ( like family members sharing a last name ) they have different species names . Occasionally , two members of a family are so similar that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these cases , the organisms are given two species names . Here are the common and scientific names of New York 's true bass : TABLE <p>                     @x Having social workers in schools has long been lauded as beneficial for the health and wellbeing for all children , not just the disadvantaged and vulnerable ones . From children 's trusts to extended schools and the aims of Every Child Matters , the drive to bring services together continues to gain momentum . <p> Last December 's Children 's Plan developed this by stating that the government sees schools as the hub through which services are accessed . The plan says : " By 2010 , all schools will be providing access to a range of extended services . " It wants all schools to offer activities including support for study and parents , and " swift and easy referral to specialist and targeted services " . <p> A Department for Children , Schools and Families spokesperson says the government does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools " but for there to be swifter and easier access to services , through co-locating them in places where families go . <p> L : CONSISTENT SERVICE Co-locating social work services in schools is also something the Children 's Workforce Development Council ( CWDC ) is backing through its remodelling social work delivery ( RSWD ) project . In April the CWDC began the three-year RSWD project in 11 pilot areas in England . The pilots aim to improve outcomes for children by testing new approaches and developing evidencebased social work through co-locating social workers in a statutory setting and a school or health centre . One local authority taking part is Westminster ( see panel ) . <p> Keith Brumfitt , CWDC 's director of research and development , says the overall project will test and disseminate models of how improved ways of working contribute to better outcomes for children and young people during the project and long term . <p> " These issues are important because children and young people tell us that consistency of social worker is one of the chief ways to improve social work intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local authorities involved in the pilots to decide whether to co-locate social workers in their schools and , according to Brumfitt , the ones that have " have found this effective " . <p> The advantages of locating social workers in schools are familiar to Jane Held , former director of Camden Council 's children 's services and now an independent consultant and professional adviser to the Local Government Association 's children and young people team . " Children do n't live in bubbles and we have provided services in bubbles for too long , " she says . " Putting services together means they can recognise what each other is doing and if they are doubling up . " <p> In a school environment social workers can do more preventive face-to-face work with children and develop joint assessment with fellow practitioners while teachers can focus on their core responsibility of teaching . Teaching Development Agency national programme adviser Caroline Coles says this approach leads to speedier referrals and early intervention and support before a situation becomes a problem . <p> " There is evidence that schools with social workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to services because social workers know who to refer to , " she adds . <p> But such an approach does have its problems . Andrew Cozens , the Improvement and Development Agency 's strategic adviser for children 's and adults services , warns there is a risk that the identified social worker is the only person other professionals rely on to deal with cases . <p> " When you have a children 's centre or an extended service it 's confusing for parents to go through a triage of professionals before their needs are met . If all practitioners had the same skills and awareness the child and their family could access the support quicker , " says Cozens . <p> Despite these concerns , Cozens says some small local authorities are opting for this approach and it is leading to a more informal exchange and an easier discussion about any concerns or risks regarding children . <p> L : NEED FOR CULTURAL CHANGE Coles believes that more needs to be done to help encourage some schools to embrace this change and welcome social care professionals into their realm : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children is ' their job ' and they should handle it . " She adds that a cultural change needs to happen to bring the children 's workforce together more effectively . <p> However , Held sees a potential problem in social workers in schools becoming isolated from their peers . This can be overcome , she says , through regular supervision and contact with their team manager and colleagues . <p> The impact on social work practice of co-locating social workers in schools is largely seen as a positive one . Free from some of the constraints of being office-based , social workers can do what they do best . " It 's all part of reclaiming social work and will improve practitioners ' practice by allowing them to intervene in a holistic way , " says Held . <p> With the firm commitment in the Children 's Plan to make services work more closely and a live CWDC pilot under way it is an exciting time for social workers going back to school . <p> The Children 's Plan : Building Brighter Futures , Department for Children , Schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remodelling Social Work Delivery project from http : **37;973;TOOLONG <p> " There are still some schools who think looking after children is ' their job ' and they should handle it " <p> L : INSIDE THIS SECTION L : 22 Book Reviews Self-advocacy skills for students , children and grief , autism <p> L : 24 Research Realities Child poverty in disadvantaged areas <p> L : ?
