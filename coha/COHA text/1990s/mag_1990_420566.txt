The first annual update of the Joe McCarthy Memorial New Enemies List . Registered Trademark <p> Well , fellow witch hunters , a lot has happened since we began our New Enemies List in July 1989 . Freedom has come to Eastern Europe , the Soviet Union has shriveled as a world power , the people of Nicaragua have given Danny Ortega the Order of the Boot , and all because of us and our brave revival of the Red Scare . As a result of our noble crusade , Communists are now just another small , half-baked cult who put out an occasional newsletter ( the Washington Post , for instance ) and pester people in airports ( particularly Peking 's ) . Tailgunner Joe must have a mile-wide smile up there in heaven 's AA meeting . <p> " But who ya gon na pick on now ? " smirk the liberals , who are no smarter running with the hares in the nineties than they were hunting with the hounds in the seventies . The answer to their question of who we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the useful idiots , the moral equivalentizers , the peace scum , the social justice hairballs , and see who sang the Marxist tune and expected us not to mind because they had the lyrics wrong . You 're next , you **33;0;TOOLONG north , you . <p> We chose November for an E-List update because Joe McCarthy would . have been eighty-two on the 14th , which also happens to be  --  let 's hear some " woooo-woooo ! " noises from West Coast conservatives who collect unicorn figurines  --  P. J. O'Rourke 's birthday , too . <p> We wo n't be able to print all the additions to the Scroll of Fools this year , partly because of sheer volume , partly because we 've already shot so many of the fish in the barrel , and partly because we 've exhausted the earth 's supply of " Fonda Commies " puns .

No doubt a happy medium will emerge . <p> First off , P. J. will exercise droit du seigneur and set a couple of burning faggots ( no sniggering , please ) at the feet of Satan 's familiars : <p> The twig-toothing leaf-brains who spray-painted my local McDonald 's with the message " Meat is Murder "  --  If meat is murder , does that mean eggs are rape ? <p> The freshly unemployed Neville Chamberlains at Nuclear Free America , who proposed replacing the Iron Curtain with a " Curtain of Peace and Freedom . " I guess if you 're caught trying to escape through the " Peace Curtain " you get petitioned to death . Among the various frisbee-witted individuals and organizations " who wholeheartedly endorse this proposal " are : <p> International Philosophers for Prevention of Nuclear Omnicide .

" <p> So much for the goofs , now let 's turn to the goons : <p> Third World Caucus/Clergy and Laity Concerned This bunch sent me a press release , trying to convince me to publish the name of the " Central Park Jogger . " What I 'll gladly publish is the coffin measurements for the filthy little jackals who almost killed her . But let me quote , with one obvious omission , from the TWC/CALC press release : <p> Our national group has voted to make known its concerns regarding the increase sic racist collaboration between the newspapers and the so-called justice system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers to treat people of color in an insensitive and completely different manner than which European suspects and victims are written about is criminal . . . <p> There are a number of cases we can refer to , but the current cases of Tawana Brawley and XXXXXXXXXX , known to the world as the Central Park Jogger , are two cases in point . Both were found near death after being assaulted . Tawana , 16 , should not have had her body exposed to the world in public . There was &; is a concerted effort not to publish the name of the older European , XXXXXXXXX ... Third World Caucus/Clergy and Laity Concerned 's address is 198 Broadway , New York , New York 10038 , and I am sure they would appreciate suggestions on where to place their future press releases . <p> Next on my personal Enemies List are : <p> Conservative Democrats : Because they 're always getting caught in bed with Ted Kennedy and telling us , " it 's okay  --  we 're not in love .

Mortarboards off to you , Rog . <p> Before I go , kudos to Polish painter Franciszek Starowieyski , who founded his own McCarthy Society in Warsaw and told the Polish weekly Przekroj : The McCarthy Society is my private society , created to honor this fine man who halted the frenzied advance of Communism turning brains into jelly . That is what his greatness is based on . This is a very elite society . I do n't even remember if anyone else besides me belongs to it . <p> And now , The TAS New Enemies List Update : <p> Let us begin on a spiritual note , with five additions from Noel K. Anderson , pastor at the First Presbyterian Church in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book of Deuteronomy 32:15 : <p> But Jeshurun waxed fat , and kicked : thou art waxen fat , thou art grown thick , thou art covered with fatness ; then he forsook God which made him , and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation . <p> The Rev. Anderson would now like us to bow our heads and say a small prayer for these people and institutions as they walk that long , lonely mile to the ducking stool : TABLE <p> Helen H.
