<p> I applaud the editorial ( Dec. 21 ) supporting the highly effective and much-needed Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program . <p> Created under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 as an outgrowth of an affordable housing program started in Chicago , the Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program is a successful financing strategy developed to stimulate private-sector involvement in affordable housing . <p> Today , tax credits are responsible for financing 95 percent of all affordable housing in the United States . However , due to inflation , they helped produce only 75,000 units of affordable housing in 1996 , down from almost 125,000 units in 1989 . The current tax credit allocations alone can not meet the need for financing affordable housing . <p> In 1997 , city-sponsored tax credits of $ 3.4 million attracted more than $ 21.1 million in equity , resulting in 775 units of low- and moderate-income rental housing . <p> Since 1994 , the Department of Housing has awarded more than $ 14.5 million in tax credits , resulting in the creation and preservation of 3,182 units of affordable housing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equity generated from these tax credits . <p> The Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program represents both a successful innovation and an important opportunity to promote and finance a steady supply of affordable housing in urban areas . A viable stock of affordable housing is imperative , especially in light of welfare reform , impending changes in public housing policies and a growing elderly population . Without this tax credit , many developers would find it is not financially feasible to undertake such projects . <p> The demand for affordable housing is greater than ever . An estimated 4.7 million households nationwide qualify for affordable housing , either because they live in substandard housing or pay more than 30 percent of their income in rent . <p> The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit is still one of the most effective tools to help build or renovate decent housing for people with low incomes . <p> However , there is still a lot of work to be done . <p> We encourage Congress to increase the federal limits by the 40 percent recommended by the Senate Finance Committee to $ 1.75 per person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1999 . <p> Julia Stasch , <p> commissioner , <p> Chicago Housing Department <p> City Colleges chaos <p> The headline on your Dec. 31 news story , " Secret vote ousts City Colleges chief , " was a bit misleading . The meeting was announced ahead of time , in compliance with the Open Meetings Act . However , it was a closed session because a personnel matter was to be discussed  --  as are all board meetings concerning personnel matters . <p> The accompanying story , " City Colleges chief 's days numbered , " says : " With strong backing from ( Board Chairman Ronald ) Gidwitz , ( Chancellor Ron ) Temple helped the board balance its chronically ailing budget . " Balanced budget ? <p> When members of my unit were laid off in October , it was blamed on a $ 10 million deficit in the budget caused by overspending in the construction of two new learning centers . <p> The article also says , " The number of full-time , credit students has been dipping . . . probably because fewer potential students enroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registrations with ridiculously long lines , a computer system that crashes during registration , tuition that has increased 50 percent , and fewer class offerings ? <p> Finally , the article says that City Colleges has " more than 150 part-time teachers . " My unit is all part time ( even though some teach more hours than full-time faculty ) and has almost 1,000 members . These members get no paid sick time or vacation ; meanwhile , City Colleges can afford to repeatedly buy out lucrative contracts of chancellors who are not working ? <p> I 'm no fan of Temple , but it is questionable why his contract would be ended . After all , when $ 96 million of taxpayers ' money was thrown away on derivatives , Gidwitz claimed he had no knowledge of the transaction and kept his post . The taxpaying public deserves to know the truth about what is going on at City Colleges . <p> Susan Tyma , <p> president , <p> AFSCME Local 3506 , <p> Chicago City Colleges <p> Adult Educators , Loop <p> Good riddance <p> I have served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no question that Chancellor Ron Temple has to go . The central administration is overstaffed . The manpower and money must be redirected toward students ' needs . <p> I resigned from the City Colleges ' administration four years ago to become a faculty member at Wright College . As the creator and former general manager of WYCC-TV Channel 20 , I have watched the station attempt to become a poor imitation of Channel 11 . WYCC under Temple has used precious financial allocations to produce programming that has nothing to do with its academic and educational mission . <p> Tragically , the fate of Channel 20 under Temple and his former assistant has served as a metaphor for the misdirection of City Colleges and its programs . We must look to the talents of a new chancellor , the faculty and the students as our hope . If there must be a central administration , it should function as a support service , not as a weight that is sinking the entire ship . <p> Elynne Chaplik Aleskow , <p> assistant professor of <p> communications , <p> Wright College <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salmonella poisoning , then mad cow disease , and now Hong Kong flu , which has killed four people and sickened a dozen more . Hong Kong may be thousands of miles away , but the flu virus is as close as the nearest international airport . <p> What do these epidemics have in common ? They are all transmitted to humans through animals raised in factory farms . And little wonder . In the filthy , crowded pens , harmless micro-organisms mutate into virulent pathogens . Routine use of antibiotics ensures their resistance to life-saving drugs . It makes one wax nostalgic for the good old days when meat eating was associated only with heart disease , stroke , cancer , diabetes and atherosclerosis . <p> What will it take for consumers to get the message ? Grains , vegetables and fresh fruits contain all the nutrients we require for a long and healthy life . They do n't carry diseases and they are n't filled up with drugs . They are touted by every major health advocacy organization . <p> The beginning of the new year is a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis , Gage Park <p> The noblest job <p> As long as I can remember I 've always wanted to be " just a mom . " <p> I remember pleading with my mother to have another child . I would say , " Oh , just have one more baby and I will do everything ! I will feed the baby , I will change the baby , and of course I will run to that baby when he ; she cries . Most of all , I will love the baby . " <p> I ca n't remember what my mother 's exact reply was , but I do recall much laughter . <p> My mother did n't have a clue as to just how serious I was about all of this . I now know that what I really wanted was the unconditional love that you can receive only from a child . <p> Now that I am a mother of three , I realize what I really desired . I am a 44-year-old mom who happens to enjoy being just a mom . I consider myself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90s who was able to accomplish her goals . <p> J. Krammer , Glendale Heights <p> White flag time <p> A gang shooting in a drug turf war again makes front-page news ( " Charges filed in shooting of toddler , " news story , Dec. 29 ) . <p> This time a 3-year-old boy , trying out his Christmas present , a Big Wheel , was shot in the back by a bullet intended for rival gang members . <p> The Rev. Charles W. Lyons said of the shooting , " That neighborhood has been a drug store since I 've been there , and I arrived in 1974 . " <p> Is anyone else infuriated ? Of course . But at whom ? At what ? The shooter ? The shooter 's gang ? All gangs ? Directing our anger there accomplishes nothing . <p> In my book this horror story will be listed under a growing list of " drug war tragedies . " We should be pointing our finger at the most responsible player  --  a drug war out of control . <p> Can this mindless " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bullet holes without someone in authority saying , " Enough drug war . We must stop the violence , stop funding the gangs with drug profits , stop putting guns in the hands of kids as an unintended consequence of a misconceived drug war . " <p> Prayer vigils , another prison and enhanced penalties for gang-bangers picking off toddlers is not answer enough . I demand an end to drug wars . <p> James E. Gierach , Oak Lawn <p> The greatest gift <p> Mary Mitchell ( column , Dec. 25 ) focused on one of the most significant social issues of our time when she realized during a pre-Christmas visit to Cook County Jail that what probably helped put so many of the inmates behind bars was a lack of love , attention and discipline early in their lives . <p> When you read about babies being killed in the crossfire between rival gangs , young mothers unable to care for a slew of children spawned by different men and filthy conditions both inside and outside many homes , you know there was little if any guidance given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't take that much effort to demonstrate by example and teach children about love , respect for themselves and others , and what is expected of them as citizens in a democratic society . <p> What is needed is a simple understanding that each new life brings obligations , and that among these are a willingness by both parents to spend time with their children , giving them love , respect and encouragement at every stage of their young lives . No purchase is required . <p> J.L. Stern , Highland Park
