Some title : A History of England , by a Prejudiced and Ignorant Historian . That 's you , Fanny . FANNY : All those silly quarrels and wars . It is so tiresome .

The Crawfords , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Bertram snoozes . HENRY : I 'm told the play is all the rage in London . It 's called Lovers " Vows . EDMUND : More dim-witted fiction to clutter the world MARY ( flirting ) : Come now , Mr. Bertram . Drama is to life what ships are to the sea-a means to traverse it , to plumb its depth and breadth and beauty . EDMUND : I could not agree more , Miss Crawford . Good drama , in which a thorough knowledge of human nature is expressed in the best language , yes , this is essential . But this play Mr. Crawford speaks of is simply trash . HENRY : What do you think , Miss Bertram ? JULIA : I ... I ... I ... MARIA : I think my brother is rather too serious about matters of love . HENRY : Ah ! So you do n't take love very seriously . What about you , Miss Price ? FANNY : I do not have a ready opinion , Mr. Crawford .

DRAWING ROOM The Bertrams and the Crawfords sit around the fire . Fanny serves them tarts . SIR THOMAS : On my next trip to Antigua , I have a good mind to bring back a slave to work here at Mansfield Park . FANNY : Correct me if I am in error , Sir Thomas , but I 've read that if you were to bring a slave to England , many would argue that he should be freed here . SIR THOMAS : Fanny , you have changed considerably in the past few months . EDMUND : Fanny has a voracious mind , father . I 've been guiding her studies . SIR THOMAS : Not her studies . I meant she has grown in health and beauty . EDMUND : I trust you will see as much beauty in her mind , father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure . Do n't you agree , Mr. Crawford ? HENRY : Purity is a decided attraction , Sir Thomas . It must be her steadfast heart that gives such a glow to her cheek . FANNY : Please ! ( Both Maria and Julia note Henry 's admiration of Fanny . ) MARY : Gentlemen , she 's blushing ! It seems Fanny Price is as fearful of a man 's attention as other women are of neglect . EDMUND ( flirting ) : Most discerning , Miss Crawford . MARY ( flirting back ) : Why , thank you , Mr. Bertram . ( Fanny sees them flirting and suddenly feels even worse . ) SIR THOMAS : We shall have a ball in honor of Fanny ! Surely some young man of good standing will take notice .

SIR THOMAS 'S STUDY . Maria bursts into her father 's study . MARIA : Father , I wish to speak to you about Rushworth . SIR THOMAS : Ah . You know how eager I was to like your Mr. Rushworth .

( We see Maria at the altar with bridesmaids . ) The bride was elegantly dressed and the bridesmaids duly inferior . ( Rushworth smiles .

Tell me , does he ever speak of me ? FANNY : He likes to hear you play music . He says that in a church service , music allows the spirit to aspire to the beyond . MARY : Heavens , why waste music on drowsy churchgoers ? Give me a dance any day . I 'm sure Edmund would agree . FANNY : Forgive me for contradicting you , but I 'm sure he would n't agree . When he takes his orders , he will lead his own church services . MARY : What ! Is Edmund to be a clergyman ? ( Edmund stands in the doorway , unseen . ) A clergyman is nothing ! EDMUND ( entering ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , as you know , the first-born . MARY : You could practice law , have your father put you into Parliament . EDMUND : No . I wish to be a clergyman .

What do Maria , Manry , and others seem to think important ? 3 Jane Austen described her work as taking place on a " little bit of ivory ( two inches wide " What did she mean by that statement ? Is it true for Mansfield Park ? About Jane Austen One of the great novelists in the English language , Jane Austen was born in 1775 in small Englis village . Her popularity has lasted for nearly 200 years , even though her books are small , not sweeping . Perhaps it is the precision with which she draws her characters and her biting wit that have earned her such a loyal readership . Today , Austen is a hot Hollywood property - Mansfield Park follows Emma , Persuasion , and Sense and Sensibility , recent movies based on her books . Eager for feedback after Mansfield Park was published in 1814 , Austen asked tamily and friends what they thought . Some comments follow below .
