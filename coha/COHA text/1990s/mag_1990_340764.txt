In his new novel , Vineland , Thomas Pynchon , that disembodied know-it-all hiding out somewhere inside our nervous system , performs an eerie kind of magic realism on the McLuhanite world around us . His is an America , in 1984 , in which reflexes , values , even feelings have been programmed by that All- Seeing Deity known as the Tube . Remaking us in its own image ( every seven days ) , TV consumes us much more than we do it . Lovers woo one another on screens , interface with friends , cite TV sets as corespondents in divorce trials . And the children who have grown up goggle-eyed around the electric altar can not believe that anything is real unless it comes with a laugh track : they organize their emotions around commercial breaks and hope to heal their sorrows with a PAUSE button . Watching their parents fight , they sit back and wait in silence for the credits . History for them means syndication ; ancient history , the original version of The Brady Bunch . <P> All this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was largely true .

A new generation of children is growing up , they say , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is our obligation to speak to them in terms they understand . MTV , USA Today , the PC and the VCR  --  why , the acronym itself !  --  are making the slow motion of words as obsolete as pictographs . The PLAY button 's the thing . Writing in the New York Times not long ago , Robert W. Pittman , the developer of MTV , pointed out just how much the media have already adjusted to the music-video aesthetic he helped create . In newspapers , " graphs , charts and larger-than-ever pictures tell the big story at a glance . Today 's movie scripts are some 25% shorter than those of the 1940s for the same length movies . " Even TV is cutting back , providing more news stories on every broadcast and less material in each one .
