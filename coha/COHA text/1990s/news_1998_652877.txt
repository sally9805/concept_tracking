<p> WHEN BATTLES AND bruised feelings over controversial movie ratings emerge , it 's useful to remember that what 's being graded is merely a strip of celluloid , never the life and reputation of a film director . Yet there was a time when directors themselves were graded politically , and if they received a " restricted " rating they faced , quite possibly , the end of their careers in Hollywood . <p> On Oct. 22 , 1950 , several hundred members of the Screen Directors Guild convened in emergency session in the Crystal Room of the Beverly Hills Hotel . One participant later called it " the most tumultuous evening " in the history of Hollywood . The showdown over a loyalty oath that would deny any Communist affiliation had finally arrived . <p> On one side : The guild 's president , Joseph L. Mankiewicz , who faced " the most dramatic evening in my life , " he later recalled . On the other : Cecil B. DeMille , one of the founders of the movie industry . <p> The Mankiewicz faction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , met before the meeting to strategize . " Gentlemen , the fat is on the fire , " Huston announced . He had scribbled some notes on sheets of paper : " hypocritical flag wavers . . . unappointed arbiters of loyalty . . . they have employed the very same tactics of those who they profess to have rallied against . . . . " <p> It was the beginning of the season of the witch in Hollywood . Dalton Trumbo , Ring Lardner Jr . and other members of the Hollywood 10 had just been hustled off to jail , the penalty for refusing , in 1947 , to answer questions about joining the Communist Party . A broad blacklist was still only a rumor , but after two years of relative quiet , another noisy , accusatory period was clearly approaching . <p> Hedda Hopper , the influential columnist , endorsed an industrywide oath , adding that " those who are n't loyal should be put in concentration camps before it 's too late . " Anti-Communist fervor in California swelled , partly because of the volatile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard M. Nixon and Helen Gahagan Douglas , a woman he labeled the " pink lady " because of her supposed sympathy for left-wing causes . <p> The 69-year-old DeMille decided that the Screen Directors Guild , which he had run for years , should be the first Hollywood craft union to institute a loyalty oath . It would require that a member declare that he or she had never joined the Communist Party , even though it was legal to do so . Y. Frank Freeman , head of Paramount , had told DeMille that such an action would have a steamroller effect ; all of the other guilds and unions in Hollywood would soon go along . <p> Only one roadblock stood in DeMille 's way : Joseph L. Mankiewicz , the newly elected president of the directors ' guild . <p> The 41-year-old Mankiewicz , who had moderately liberal political views , was just emerging as a powerful figure in Hollywood ; earlier in the year , he had won Academy Awards for writing and directing " A Letter to Three Wives , " and he had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to win six Oscars , including those for best screenplay , best director and best picture . <p> Fearing that Mankiewicz might oppose a loyalty oath , DeMille decided to put the measure to a test while the guild president was in Europe . He assembled the board of the guild on Aug. 18 , 1950 , to propose a bylaw that would make signing an oath mandatory for members . " A tremendous principle has to be acted upon here , " DeMille told the board . " The question we are asking is , Are you on the American side or on the other side ? There are members of the guild on the other side and we all know that . . . . " <p> WHEN MANKIEWICZ returned to the United States , he questioned the morality and legality of the newly approved oath . But DeMille was only getting started . He screened several of Mankiewicz 's films , looking for Communist propaganda . His chief ally , Albert S. Rogell , vice president of the guild , openly accused Daily Variety of being " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-oath statements . <p> On Oct. 9 , at a heated guild board meeting , Mankiewicz continued to rail against the oath , particularly the requirement that the guild send producers the names of all directors not in compliance . He proposed a full meeting of the membership to discuss it , and said that in protest , he would refuse to sign the oath . This would put that year 's Oscar-winning director on his own guild 's blacklist . <p> DeMille and one of his key supporters , Frank Capra , disputed the use of the word blacklist , pointing out that producers could still hire anyone they wished . <p> " This guy 's un-American but you can hire him  --  that 's a blacklist ! " Mankiewicz replied . <p> " I will not stand for any blacklist , " John Ford said , " but why should n't a man stand up and be counted ? " <p> " Because , " Mankiewicz answered , " nobody appointed DeMille to do the counting . " <p> Now the intrigue thickened . DeMille called a secret meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to initiate a recall movement against their president . This group of 16  --  which included Frank Capra , Leo McCarey and Andrew Stone  --  would try to accomplish the recall before Mankiewicz had a chance to stop it , but it required the support of 60 percent of the guild 's membership , or 167 votes . <p> The next day , Vernon Keays , the guild 's executive secretary , mobilized the guild staff to prepare slips of paper carrying the message : " This is a ballot to recall Joe Mankiewicz . Sign here  --  Yes . " There was no explanation of why Mankiewicz should be ousted , no opportunity to vote no , and the ballots were marked so that voting would not be secret . <p> Then the secretaries addressed the ballots , carefully avoiding several dozen members close to Mankiewicz who might expose the attempted coup , then shipped them to DeMille 's office at Paramount . There they were given to messengers on motorcycles  --  it was a scene out of prewar Germany or Italy  --  who delivered the ballots well into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precautions , Mankiewicz learned of the recall movement , and on Oct. 13 he called a meeting of possible supporters in the back room of Chasen 's restaurant . Mankiewicz 's lawyer , Martin Gang , predicted that if the recall succeeded , the director 's film career would probably be over . Gang proposed two actions : a petition within the guild calling for a general meeting , and a legal injunction nullifying the result of the current recall vote . <p> The injunction needed only one sponsor , and Huston quickly signed on . But the petition required 25 names , and there was n't a minute to waste , so the anti-oath faction spent the rest of the evening hunting all over town for signatures . Among those who did sign : Nicholas Ray , Richard Brooks , George Seaton , Mark Robson , Robert Wise , Fred Zinnemann and Joseph Losey . <p> Finally , at about 2 A.M. , a limousine was dispatched to Walter Reisch 's home to secure signature No. 25 . <p> In response , several members of the guild board , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case against Mankiewicz . Among the allegations : He was trying to overturn the board 's " legal and orderly " decision on the oath , and he was making " untrue and incendiary " allusions to a " blacklist . " <p> But the board had no choice but to accept the pro-Mankiewicz petition and schedule a general meeting the following Sunday evening at the Beverly Hills Hotel . <p> DeMille , now on the defensive , privately proposed a compromise : he would drop the recall motion if Mankiewicz would perform " an act of contrition . " He suggested that Mankiewicz write up something and give it to Louella Parsons , " who can read this to the American people . . . that you are sorry for what you have done . " <p> " Oh , hell , " Mankiewicz reportedly replied , " you can stuff your act of contrition . " Capra , who had grown disgusted with DeMille , resigned from the guild board . <p> With that , it was clear that the Oct. 22 meeting , which was taking place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was likely to be one of those rare Hollywood blockbusters that actually lived up to its billing . <p> That night , Mankiewicz brought along his friend Elia Kazan , who had just finished filming " A Streetcar Named Desire . " As their car pulled up outside the hotel , Kazan suddenly revealed that he could not attend the meeting . DeMille knew about his Communist Party membership , he explained , and would use it ( and anything else ) against Mankiewicz . <p> Still shaken , Mankiewicz opened the proceedings with a low-key recital of the facts as he saw them , ending with an attack on the " Politburo quality " of the move to recall him . Then DeMille took the stage , declaring , " No one has accused Mr. Mankiewicz of being a Communist . " But DeMille would not leave it at that . Instead , he veered off into an assault on many of Mankiewicz 's supporters , reciting a list of Communist front groups they had once been associated with , while suggesting that if Mankiewicz stayed in office his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoked a torrent of response . " I resent paper-hat patriots who stand up and holler , ' I am an American ' and contend that no one else is , " Don Hartman complained . Huston told DeMille that many of Mankiewicz 's admirers " were in uniform when you were wrapping yourself in the flag . " But it was the dignified , and highly respected , George Stevens who delivered the coup de grace , reading from a report on his personal , in-depth investigation of DeMille 's recall movement . <p> " It was rigged , " Stevens announced , " and it was organized , and it was supposed to work . . . . Mr. Mankiewicz would have been out . . . . He would just have been smeared and out . . . quick , overnight , or in 36 hours , if you please . . . . " <p> Now on the run , McCarey , one of DeMille 's allies , explained , " Everybody was moving pretty fast , and it was a fire , and maybe we used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I am the only one that got wet . " But DeMille held firm and continued to refer to several directors ' susceptibility to Communism . Adopting what was apparently intended as a Jewish accent , he read off the names of " Mr. Villy Vyler . . . Mr. Fleddie Zinnemann . . . . " <p> This was too much for Wyler . " I am sick and tired of having people question my loyalty to my country , " he protested . " The next time I hear somebody do it , I am going to kick hell out of him . I do n't care how old he is or how big . " <p> FRITZ LANG ADDED , " Mr. DeMille , do you know this is the first time since I 'm in America that I 'm afraid , because I have an accent ? " Then , to wild applause , someone called for kicking DeMille off the guild 's board , and some started heckling him . <p> Still Mankiewicz felt he could not be certain of the support of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight , he saw Ford raise his hand . " I admire you , " Ford told DeMille , " but I do n't like you , and I do n't like a thing you stand for . " <p> Ford had helped found the guild , he said , " to protect ourselves against producers . " Now , he continued , " somebody wants to . . . give out to producers what looks to me like a blacklist . " <p> Ford closed by calling for the resignation of the entire board . " Let 's turn the guild over to the Polack , and go home , " he pleaded , referring to Mankiewicz . " Tomorrow , let 's go back and make movies . " This produced thunderous applause , Mankiewicz sighed with relief , and the meeting adjourned at 2:20 A.M. , with DeMille trudging from the hall , disgraced but still defiant . <p> The issue appeared settled . Almost lost in the calm that followed was the fact that the guild 's loyalty oath , adopted by the now-deposed board , remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote an open letter to the guild membership , calling on them to sign the oath , as he had now done , setting aside " whatever reservations you may have concerning any aspect of the oath or its method of adoption . " <p> Why ? Mankiewicz explained that " a wicked and widespread misconception " continued to exist " both within our industry and without  --  a misconception that continues to vilify and smear both our persons and our guild . " <p> " It is essential , " he said , " that you help to remove that misconception . " <p> It was true that this was a request , not a demand , and that the nonsigners would not necessarily be placed on a blacklist . Still , it seemed to many that the battle-scarred Mankiewicz had abandoned his principled opposition to all such oaths . Variety now reported that it appeared that an industrywide oath would soon be adopted , also " voluntary " in nature . <p> The Mankiewicz triumph in October 1950 had only thwarted the very worst excesses of Communist-hunting in Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if " the loyalty oath had n't gone through the guild , history might have been slightly different , because it started the ball rolling . " <p> A second round of Congressional hearings on Communism in Hollywood took place in March 1951 , and they made the 1947 probe " look like a college musical , " as one writer commented . The ex-Communist actors Larry Parks and Sterling Hayden and , later , the director Kazan turned on their old friends . A blacklist was solidly enshrined , and it did not fade until the end of the decade .
