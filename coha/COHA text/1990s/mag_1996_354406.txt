YOU PLAYED THE GROWNUP WHEN your boss dropped by your desk and , without so much as a " Good morning , " disemboweled your latest departmental memo . You nodded , scribbled notes , praised his constructive criticism . Now , too peeved to concentrate , you phone a colleague and let your inner child rage . Grrrr . Insensitive troglodyte . Unappreciative bonehead . Grrrr . There , you feel better . Back to work . <P> Just as you 're beginning to see that your boss 's critique was not so off base , he suddenly reappears , demanding to know what you meant by " troglodyte "  --  a word he intercepted while monitoring your phone line . Now you 've got a real problem . <P> Workplace privacy has always been a sensitive issue that weighs a boss 's right to know what 's going on in the office against an employee 's right to be left alone . But in Illinois that delicate balance has been upset by a new state law that permits bosses to eavesdrop on employees ' work phones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law was intended solely to enable supervisors to monitor service calls for courtesy and efficiency . But on the way to Republican Governor Jim Edgar for a Dec. 13 signing , the measure was reworked to embrace any listening in that serves " educational , training or research purposes " without defining inappropriate monitoring . The final bill is more permissive than laws in many other states , as well as the federal wiretap law , which instructs listeners to hang up if they chance upon a personal call . <P> This leaves Illinois workers skittishly wondering who might be listening in , and when . After all , in this era of expanding work hours and contracting leisure time , who has n't used the office phone to learn the results of an anxiously awaited medical test or to do battle with a creditor ? " I do n't condone the misuse of company telephones , but suppose you call home with a marital or a financial problem . Clearly , you are in jeopardy if your employer knows something about those kinds of things , " says Nan Otto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators . " It 's the George Orwell kind of thing . " <P> " We have no desire to become Big Brother , " counters Rob Karr of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association . He points out that the law forbids taped conversations from being passed on to third parties and requires employers to gain permission before they eavesdrop . But the Illinois law is unclear whether that means telling employees each time they plan to listen or issuing just a one-time blanket warning . As for bosses who stumble into private conversations , Karr says if a worker is doing personal business on company time , bosses " probably have the right to be listening in . " <P> Civil libertarians harrumph about " electronic sweatshops , " and the AFL-CIO aims to prove that the law violates Illinois ' bill of rights , which guards against " interceptions of communications by eavesdropping devices . " Meantime , smart workers might do best to stew in silence . Grrrr . <P>  --  By Jill Smolowe . Reported by Mark Shuman/Chicago          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
