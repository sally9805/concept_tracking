Tim Allen is still learning the protocols of stardom . On a promotion tour for his new book earlier this fall , he went on a talk show and laughed about the private plane that his publisher , which is owned by Disney , was flying him around in . Known for its thriftiness , Disney hates being made to look like a typical , money-burning Hollywood studio , and a few days after Allen made his remarks , he received a curt memo from headquarters . Never brag about Disney 's use of corporate jets , the company 's biggest star next to Simba the Lion was told ; do n't even mention corporate jets and Disney in the same sentence . Now , some stars might have thrown a fit  --  or got their agent to do it for them . But Allen reacted like a chastened fifth-grader ; he told Disney it was just a joke . <P> Good thing Allen did n't mention the new four-wheel-drive Porsche the studio just bought him . But then , the Disney comptroller can hardly complain . Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company during a year in which he has pulled off an unheard-of triple play . Home Improvement , his ABC sitcom now in its fourth season , is TV 's No. 1-rated show , earning Disney $400 million thus far in the sale of reruns . His jokey autobiographical book , Do n't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man , reached No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list in October and is still riding high in second place ( trailing only the Pope ) ; it is the most successful book yet published by Disney 's 3 1/2-year-old book division , Hyperion . Now The Santa Clause , Allen 's first movie , is the surprise hit of the Christmas season , earning $71 million in its first 17 days and jumping to No. 1 at the box office over the Thanksgiving weekend  --  surpassing Tom Cruise 's fangs , Schwarzenegger 's pregnancy and both generations of Star Trek . <P> It 's a success story as heartwarming as one of those sentimental father-son talks on Home Improvement . Allen , 41 , is hardly the most brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him its most brilliant example of multimedia Hollywood marketing . But few superstars seem less inflated by their success . Allen still keeps a home in an unpretentious neighborhood in suburban Birmingham , Michigan , where he retreats for holidays and other family gatherings . He has been married for 10 years to his college sweetheart , who waited for him while he served more than two years in a federal penitentiary on drug charges . And when he throws temper tantrums on the set of his TV show  --  " My set ! My camera ! My props ! " , he 's been heard to shout  --  everybody knows it really is a joke . In contrast to stories about some other sitcom stars , like Roseanne and Grace Under Fire 's Brett Butler , those about Tim Allen 's rampaging ego are all but nonexistent . " He just never lost perspective , " says Bruce Economou , an old friend from Michigan . " When he first went to the Home Improvement stage , where they were building the sets , and the people from Disney were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all for you . ' Tim looked at it and said , ' Well , if this show does n't work , can I have the wood ? " '
