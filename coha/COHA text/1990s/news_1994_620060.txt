<p> San Anselmo architect Daniel Thomas is a longtime registered Democrat who pays attention to public affairs and takes politics seriously . But Thomas did not vote in the primary election in June . <p> " For one thing , I was real busy , " the 58-year-old Thomas said in a recent interview . " For another , I was n't really interested . . . . When it came right down to it , I really did n't care about it . " <p> By failing to exercise his franchise , Thomas joined the vast majority of California voters . The turnout in the June primary election  --  only 26.2 percent of eligible voters  --  was the lowest since 1928 . For the first time in state history , the number of people who voted was smaller than the number of adults in California who are not citizens . <p> " There are more people outside of the political process but affected by it than are voting in state elections , " said Mark DiCamillo , director of the Field Poll . " To me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whose interests are being served by government . " <p> DiCamillo pointed out that this development is particularly important in an era in which some measures  --  like Proposition 187 , which among other things would exclude illegal immigrants from schools and universities  --  will have a major impact on the growing number of resident noncitizens . <p> STEADY DECLINE IN TURNOUT <p> Except for a brief upward spike in 1988 and 1990 , California voter turnout in primary elections has dropped steadily during the past 16 years , from 67.8 percent in 1978 to 26.2 percent this year . <p> Voter participation in general elections during the same period has shown a similar decline , from 68.8 percent in the 1960 presidential election to 54.5 percent in 1992 . <p> Government officials find the downward trend unsettling . <p> " Clearly , voters are tuning out in record numbers , turned off by politics and politicians , " said Tony Miller , California 's acting Secretary of State . <p> Voters who have opted out of the system give a variety of reasons : too little time ; unfamiliarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process ; and a growing cynicism about the political process itself . <p> According to an informal , unscientific survey of California voter and nonvoter attitudes conducted by the Secretary of State 's office in 1986 , nearly half of the 150 nonvoters who responded said they had not cast ballots because they did not understand the issues well enough to vote intelligently . Another 28 percent said they distrusted politicians , 14 percent said they forgot to vote or register , and 15 percent said they did not believe their vote would make a difference . <p> Interviews with registered nonvoters from six Bay Area counties demonstrated a similar range of reasons , but reflected an undercurrent of dissatisfaction with politics and government . <p> For example , Thomas , the Marin County architect , said he did not vote in June because he was too busy . But he added that he was put off by the rancorous tone and shallow content of the gubernatorial campaign . <p> " Nobody running for office is really listening to the average person anymore , " he said . " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person casting his vote . " <p> Eugene Morita , a 59-year-old physician from San Rafael and a registered Republican , said he was out of town on election day and failed to get an absentee ballot beforehand . <p> But , like Thomas , Morita said he is turned off by the negative style of many campaigns . <p> " A lot of them are mean-spirited and have nothing to do with the issues at hand , " he said . " There are n't any issues discussed any more . They ( politicians ) have these 30-second pieces and ca n't really say anything of substance in them . I think it is really disgusting . " <p> Even voters who said they simply forgot about the primary election this year said political campaigns discourage participation . <p> Christine Yelda , 29 , a fitness supervisor from Menlo Park who is a registered Democrat , said she had to travel to New Jersey during the election and " I just spaced it out . " But Yelda added that the often testy campaign between gubernatorial candidates Kathleen Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote . <p> ' I DO N'T LIKE NAME-CALLING ' <p> " I dislike negative campaigning , when they ( office-seekers ) are not dealing with real issues , " she said . " I do n't like name-calling . " <p> The trend toward nonparticipation marks a major shift in public attitudes about government and civic responsibility , experts say . <p> DiCamillo , the director of the Field Poll , said that in the past , many voters traditionally considered it their duty to cast ballots in every election , no matter how minor the issues ; today 's voters increasingly participate only on a sporadic basis . <p> Many nonvoters say they fail to participate because they lack the time to study the issues or go to the polls . <p> Aaron Wong , a 24-year-old computer worker from Alameda , said he was too busy with work and volunteer service as a Sunday school teacher for his church . " I just did n't have time , " he said . <p> Others explain their failure to vote by saying they recently moved and lacked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MANY ON THE MOVE <p> The mobility problem is supported by substantial evidence : When The Chronicle attempted to contact 54 registered Bay Area nonvoters whose names were selected from county registrar lists at random , 24 of them had moved since 1992 . <p> " This is a highly mobile population , " said Curtis Gans , the director of the Center for the Study of the American Electorate . " There has been an almost total atomization of our society . " <p> Some voters contacted by The Chronicle said they simply never got around to casting their ballot . <p> " Actually , " said Stefanie Bellia , a 28-year-old student and registered Republican from Concord , " I just forgot . " <p> But experts say explanations like these often mask the underlying reasons voters fail to participate . <p> " These are simple answers to give , " said DiCamillo . " We think there are larger things going on here . People are turning away from politics . They are turning away from government . . . . These are global things that many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed with DiCamillo 's view . <p> " These days , all you see are synthetic campaigns run on television , " Gans said . " There is almost no real grassroots campaigning any more in California . Traditional party organizational formats like the California Democratic Council have almost disappeared . " <p> Gans also noted that a media preoccupation with governmental scandal has increased public cynicism about politics  --  a cynicism that politicians reinforce by their insistence on negative campaigning and mudslinging . The net result , he says , is a loss of public faith in political institutions . <p> " There is a wholesale move from the pursuit of civic values to the pursuit of self-seeking values , " he said . " Voting is a least common denominator type of activity , so when people do n't vote , they do n't do anything else , either . The pool of potential volunteers for community services goes down . <p> " Government in the general interest declines , while government in the special interests increases . Government activity becomes dominated by those groups that have the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our society . " <p> CHART : CALIFORNIA PRIMARY TURNOUT , 1978-1994 .
