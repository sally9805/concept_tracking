He watched her fidget with her hair , hair thick and curly that she 'd somehow managed to braid  --  even though her hair was still too short for much plaiting  --  pinning the meager braids with two wooden clasps on top of her head . Tendrils of shorter hair curled about her face and several long , loose strands trailed down the back of her neck . Even with the shorter spikes of red hair sticking out of the braids , she still looked very female , and he admitted to himself , in her woman 's clothes , she was lovely . Indeed , despite the still pale yellow-and-green bruise on her cheek , she looked quite acceptable . By the gods , he thought , she looked beautiful , that violent red hair of hers glistening in the bright sunlight .

He hated it for there was nothing he could point to , nothing to focus upon . There was nothing to do but wait . Eller shouted , " I do n't smell anything , Merrik , but there is Malverne ! I see it yon ! " The other men craned to look and shouted . Oleg came to stand beside Merrik . " ' T was a good trading trip , " he said . " Our chests are full with silver . The women will show us much appreciation for the beautiful furs we brought them . " Merrik grinned , dismissing his foolish feelings , now as carefree as a boy . " Aye , and the brooch I brought my mother will make her smile and feed me all her delicious meals until my belly puffs out . " LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 101  | Oleg laughed .

" " Ah , I brought my father a knife of great value , its handle an odd ivory from beyond Bulgar . " Oleg only laughed louder . " And I brought Harald a cask for his jewels and I will have the runemaster engrave it to him . " Merrik punched his arm . Oleg hit him in the belly . The longboat rocked . The men laughed and shouted ad-vice . The two men grappled , grunting from each other 's blows , and the longboat tipped first one way and then the other . Laren watched them , smiling , until she saw that Merrik was perilously close to a loose sharp-edged oar . She called out just as Oleg shoved him and he lost his balance . He flailed at the empty air , looked utterly astonished and went overboard . The men hooted with laughter even as they fished him out . He came dripping into the longboat , and shook himself as would a mongrel dog . " You think it funny ? " he said to Laren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aye , you have the look of a drowned god . " His own laughter died in his throat . A god ? She believed he looked like a god ? He turned quickly , uncomfortable with her words , at the sound of Taby 's laugh . The child was laughing and pointing and trying to get to Merrik . " Keep your distance , Prince Taby , " he called . " I do not want you to become as wet a god as I. " When they arrived at the long single dock that lay at the base of a winding pathway up to the huge farmstead atop , the men could no longer contain their excitement ,  | for there were their wives and children awaiting them on the dock , shouting to them . Merrik scanned the gathered people for his father and mother . He saw his brother , Erik , and from this distance he did n't see any welcoming smile on his brother 's handsome face . His heart began to pound , slow deep strokes . The foreboding he 'd felt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . Both his father and mother were dead of a virulent plague that had struck the farmstead a month before .  | MERRIK SAT SILENT and still , hunched over on the long bench , a cup of mead between his cupped hands . His brother Erik sat beside him , silent as well . Finally , Erik said , " Their passing was swift . They did not suffer overly . It struck so quickly , I can not tell you how it was , not really . Death was here and you could smell it and feel it in the very air around you , and there was naught anyone could do , save look on and watch the ones we loved die . " Erik paused a moment , shaking his head . " Sarla was ill but she recovered . I believe it was she who gave the illness to our mother , for Mother tended to her . And then it struck our father who would n't leave Mother 's side for an instant . Aye , and Sarla survived it . " Merrik wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't Sarla 's fault , but words stuck in his throat . He felt his control slipping and swallowed , lowering his head even more . Erik continued after a moment . " The older people , well , they were struck hard and most of them died . Our parents were amongst the first . Ten of our people died , eight slaves . It was n't a good time . I wish you had been here , but perhaps it was better that you were not . I would not wish to have lost you . "  | " Did it strike any of the other farmsteads ? " " You mean our cousin Egil ? Nay , he and his family were spared . It came here and stayed , then was gone suddenly like a ghost that fades away in the stark light of day . All of Gravak Valley was spared , save us . " Sarla appeared at Merrik 's elbow , and said quietly , " You must eat , Merrik . I have prepared the stewed venison you very much like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have not her skill , but it is tasty enough , I think . " He smiled up at her , this shy wife of his brother 's , so slight , quite pretty really when one looked at her closely , but she was so quiet that it was easy not to notice her . Her hair was a dark , rich blond , her eyes more gray than blue , her skin fair and pure . She was also dominated completely by Erik , as most were . He was glad she had survived . " Thank you , Sarla , but I have no hunger . Please see to the other men . " He realized then that he had forgotten about Laren and Taby . " Sarla , please see as well to the woman and child I brought with me . The man 's name is Cleve . They will sleep here in the longhouse . " She nodded , touched his sleeve , and asked if he wished more mead . Before he could reply , his brother said , his voice cold with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sarla , he will tell you . Get you back to your duties . " She said nothing , merely bowed her head and left the brothers . Erik said , " You bought them in Kiev , so Eller told me . " " I bought the child . The woman and man came to me free . " For a moment , his grief fell away from him and he smiled at his brother . " Actually , we had to flee Kiev before an enraged merchant discovered he 'd just lost a boy and a man . " LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 105  | " Boy ? She is very obviously a girl . " " Aye , but then she was a boy , thin as a stick and dressed in ragged breeches and tunic . Even I did n't realize she was n't a boy until I had to tend her back . This merchant Thrasco had beaten her very badly . " " She is a slave , then , " Erik said , satisfaction in his voice . Merrik said nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thoughts were on his parents again . " She is still thin , " Erik said , and Merrik looked up to see his brother 's eyes on Laren , seated near the fire pit , Sarla standing beside her . " But she does n't look sickly . " " No , she does n't . You should have seen her when I managed to flee with her . She was naught more than bones covered with white flesh . The child , too , was so thin it would make you cry , Erik . " " The child ? " He looked toward Taby who was playing with a leather ball . " Surely he is more a burden than anything . Did the girl beg you to buy him ? Did she promise to be your whore if you bought him ? But none of that would matter , for a man does as he pleases with a woman , and a slave is of no account at all . Why in the name of the gods did you buy a child , Merrik ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw him and I knew I had to have him . Laren had nothing to do with it . She 'd already been bought by the merchant . I bought Taby . " Merrik shrugged . " Aye , he is mine now . I saved her because she is Taby 's sister . " " Ah , " Erik said and fell again silent . " Why is there a bruise on her cheek ? It is nearly gone now but still I can make it out . Was she insolent ? Did you have to strike her ? " Merrik did n't want to answer his brother 's questions . He wanted only to feel his grief and not be further distracted from it . " No , " he said shortly , rising , " I did not strike her . I am going outside for a while , Erik . I must  | be alone . I suppose I need it for a little while . " Erik thoughtfully watched his brother walk to the wide oak doors of the longhouse and go outside . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Kiev . She was laughing softly at something the child said . Her face lit up as she hugged the little boy close to her . She stood back again to toss the ball to him . Erik rose . He looked about the large outer chamber that was filled with the soft blue haze of smoke from the fire pit . A thin thread of blue smoke trailed upward , disappearing through the small circular hole in the roof of the longhouse . As a child he 'd stared and stared at that slender blue line that seemed unreal , so steady was it and so unchanging , and so very blue . Some things did n't change , he thought , just the people looking at them did . He felt tears burn his eyes , but they did n't overflow , not now , not in over a week now . The large outer room was warm , filled with conversation . Some laughter , but quickly muted , some angry words , children being scolded , so very normal , all of it . Erik let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and comforting nonetheless . He could hear the tenor of the voices , hear the sorrow in the voices , so much sorrow , deep within everyone , so close to the surface , so very close . He sighed . Unlike Merrik , whose pain he understood well , he 'd had a month to accustom himself to his father 's and mother 's passing . And , unlike Merrik , he 'd had to live with them here at Malverne , never leaving as Merrik did on trading voyages since he , Erik , was the eldest son . Ah , and he 'd argued with them even when he 'd reached his man years and they 'd had no reason not to agree with him , not to let him have his way , and thus his memories were tempered with the bitter quarrels , the shouting , the bone-deep LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 107  | anger he 'd sometimes felt toward them . They 'd disliked his keeping Caylis and Megot , though they 'd treated his son by Caylis , Kenna , well enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become angry at her and struck her . Aye , there was much to temper his memory of his mother and father . But not Merrik , not the favored younger son who was never here at Malverne . Now Malverne was his and his alone . There would be no more arguments with his father on something he wished to do . He was the master now , he was the lord . Only what he said mattered . There were none left to gainsay him . He looked over at his wife , Sarla , knowing in his belly that she was barren , knowing that he would have to rid himself of her if he wished an heir . Or , if he kept her , then one of his other sons could be made legitimate . Probably Kenna , Caylis 's son , a handsome boy of eight who looked just like Erik had at that age . Certainly Sarla would never say anything to him that might displease him enough to dismiss her . She was little more than a shadow , a quiet child whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for she lay there , cold and silent , waiting for him to be done with her . And he had hurt her many times because he 'd wanted her to cry out , wanted to hear something from her , whether it be pleasure or pain . The smell of venison was strong , too strong . He frowned . When his mother prepared the venison stew , the smells were wondrous , the smell of the meat never overpowering the other ingredients . What could he expect ? Sarla had not his mother 's skills . Sarla gave Laren two blankets and told her in her quiet way to sleep close to the fire pit , for the night would be chilly and the still-glowing embers would keep her warm throughout the night . As for Cleve , Sarla  | merely handed him a blanket and said , " Any place you wish to rest is fine . " Then she smiled at him . Cleve looked down at the slight female in front of him . Did n't she see the hideous scars on his face ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind ? He merely nodded to her as he took the blanket . " Sarla ! " She raised her head to see her husband standing , hands on hips , his handsome features cold with impatience . It was always so with her . He was always impatient , always displeased with her about something . She supposed she could n't blame him . She did little that was like his mother did , though Tora had never scolded her or treated her meanly . But her husband did . She sighed , feeling her body retreat inward . He wanted her to come to his bed and she did n't want to . He wanted her to see to his pleasure . She did n't want to do that , either , but she supposed she preferred that to lying on her back and feeling him invade her and sweat over her , making those ugly grunting noises . Whatever he wanted , she had no choice . She lowered her head , not looking at anyone for she knew that all the men would realize what her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sarla , " Erik called to her again , more of an edge on his voice now . " You will come to my sleeping chamber now . " It had always been his sleeping chamber , never theirs . Thus it was now with Malverne . Since his father had died , Malverne was his and he enjoyed saying it aloud , for she 'd heard him saying it , savoring the taste of it on his tongue . Now his parents ' sleeping chamber was his . She supposed Merrik would take his former sleeping chamber , but as yet he 'd said nothing about it . Probably it had n't even occurred to him , for he was so LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 109  | immersed in shock and in grief . As for her , she was here only because she was his wife and she doubted he would send her away . For what reason ? She thought of her parents ' farmstead , not too far to the north of Vestfold , and shuddered . She saw her father , his wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowed , her back naked , saw the belt come down again and again , saw her mother fall and lie huddled on the ground . She saw her father turn to her , and she saw the smile of rage on his face . She shuddered again . She preferred Erik . Besides , he had his women so he did n't bother her all that often . Never had he struck her . She walked slowly to him , stopping in front of him , her head still bowed . His hand closed over her upper arm . " I have need of you tonight , " he said . Laren watched the two of them , frowning . Taby said , " Merrik 's father and mother are dead , just like ours . He is very sad , Laren . " " Aye , he is . He was so excited about seeing them again . " She remembered the strange feelings he 'd had and wondered at it . She set about unfolding the blankets and arranging them on the packed earthen floor . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ease between the great oak doors of the longhouse . She started to call after him , but saw that many of the Malverne people were wrapped in their blankets on the benches and the floor . She rose instead and followed him . Taby saw Merrik standing near the palisade wall , utterly silent and unmoving . He was looking upward at the brilliant display of stars overhead . It was very quiet . The huge expanse of water below , the treecovered mountains on the opposite side of the fjord , all was silent , eerily so .  | " I 'm sorry they died , " Taby said to the big man who towered over him , the man he trusted more than anyone he 'd ever known in his short life , other than his sister . Merrik turned to look down at the child . Words clogged in his throat . He knew his cheeks were wet but he did n't care . His grief was deep and his pain at his loss deeper . " I do n't remember my mother and father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too young when they died , but Laren tells me about them sometimes . She tells very good stories . " " I know . " " Sometimes she cries , just like you 're doing . I ask her why and she says that the memories of them are so very sharp and sweet that crying makes her almost feel them and taste them again . Sometimes I do n't understand what she means . " Ah , but Merrik did . He leaned down and lifted Taby into his arms . He carried him to an oak tree that was probably as old as the cliffs that the fjord had cut through below and eased down , leaning back against the trunk . He settled the boy against his chest . He began to rub Taby 's back in wide , soothing circles . He said quietly , his voice deep and low , " I am lucky , for I grew to manhood with my parents . But that makes their passing that much more difficult , for I knew them first as parents , then as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as my dearest friends . My father was a very proud man , but he was a man who loved his children , a man who loved his wife dearly , a man who would never act unfairly or hurt another out of anger . " " He is like you , " Taby said , settling in against Mer-rik 's shoulder .  | Merrik smiled and lightly kissed the top of Taby 's head . " To be like my father would be a great accom-plishment , " he said . " You would have loved my mother , Taby . All children flocked to her and she gave them all equal measures of love and attention . She was warm and strong and my father never tried to make her into a submissive female . " " She sounds like Laren . " That made him frown . " Hardly . My mother was very different from your sister . She had not your sister 's pride , her vanity , her arrogance . " He remembered telling Laren that his mother was a warrior one minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more deeply . " I do n't understand what you mean , " Taby said . " Laren is my sister . She would kill to save me . She would die to save me too . " " That may be true , " Merrik said . He did n't want to speak of Laren . She was only important because she was Taby 's sister . He did n't want her to be important in any other way . He thought of her throwing herself against him at Kaupang simply because he 'd bought clothing for both Cleve and Taby . He clearly remembered the feel of her , the touch of her warm breath on his cheek . He said now , " I must leave Malverne soon , for now it is my brother 's home , and he and Sarla will have children , surely , and it is not large enough for both of us . Aye , I had thought of it before , thought that I must leave soon and build my own house , farm my own land . My other brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of East Anglia called Hawkfell Island . It 's a beautiful place and it is his alone . I must make my own way as he did . What do you think , Taby ? " Taby was asleep . Laren said quietly , stepping into his line of vision , " A man must be his own master , tread on ground that is  | his alone , farm land where he spreads his own grain and tends and reaps it . " Merrik was silent for a moment . He was taken off guard , and he did n't like it . She 'd come upon them , silent as a shadow , and overheard him . He did n't like that , for he 'd also been thinking of her , and he did n't want her to get close to those thoughts , to guess about them , perhaps . His words to Taby were really meant for himself , not for anyone else , for Taby was a child without a man 's reason . And yet she was here , coming upon him like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I like it not that you hide yourself and listen to words not meant for your ears . It is true , though , and I will repeat it to your face : your pride is overweening . You are as arrogant as a warrior , which is absurd . Your belief in your own value is more than a female 's should be . " She only shrugged . " I had not heard you say that , but if that is what you believe , why then there is little I can do about it . " He sighed , wishing he 'd not spoken . " Does your leg pain you ? " " Not so much now . The cream is wondrous . " " There wo n't be more , for my mother is dead . Perhaps she taught Sarla how to make it . We will see . " He stared off into the nothingness beyond her , and thought , first she is starved then beaten and then burned . His anger at her died . Her damned pride and arrogance had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Aye , he thought , that part of her was like his mother , or more like his sister-in-law Mirana , Rorik 's wife , perhaps , a woman he 'd hated at first , for he saw her tainted and befouled with a villain 's blood as had his parents . He 'd distrusted her , feared for his brother . Ah , but she 'd LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 113  | been strong and loyal and as stubborn as his brother . He sighed now , saying , " I hate the suddenness of death . The finality of it . To die in battle  --  a man is ready for that , at least he is in his heart , if not fully in his mind , because he knows that if he falls , he will go to Valhalla and live there for all eternity . But to be felled by an illness that is unexpected , to be helpless against it , to know there is nothing you can do , that is frightening . It strips a man of dignity , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line of her mouth . " That is life . Honor and dignity have nothing to do with death . I see being cleaved into two parts in battle as no more a virtue than being struck down by an illness or an assassin 's knife . There is so much death in life that soon you can not think of one without the other . Death is always riding on your shoulder . Always . It all ends in the same thing . You are no more . " " You speak harshly and you do n't understand the virtues of a man 's passing in a certain way , in a way of his own choosing , in a way that proclaims his valor , his worth . My father did not choose this plague . " " Neither did your mother . Remember , Merrik , women do not have the chance to be butchered in battle as do men . Do all their deaths lack honor and dignity ? " " I do n't know . I had n't thought of it in that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said slowly . " They are . " She started to say something else , then just shook her head , obviously changed her mind and said , " Aye , they are , and men are lucky to be larger and stronger . " He said , thinking again of her burned leg , " You sur-vived . " She laughed , but it was n't a joyous laugh . ' Without you I would not have survived much langer . I think that Thrasco was the final link in the chain . When he dis-  | covered I was n't a boy , he would have either sold me or killed me . Since Taby was gone from me , since I 'd failed to keep him with me and as safe as I could keep him , why then it would n't have mattered . " " You would have killed yourself ? " She was silent for a very long time , just standing there close to him , the moonlight at her back now and he could n't see her face , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , " she said at last . " I had no time to dwell upon it . I was intent only on finding Taby . And then you came . I am very sorry about your parents , Merrik . I am sorry for your pain . " He said nothing , merely leaned back against the rough bark of the oak tree and closed his eyes . " Leave Taby with me , " he said , his eyes still closed . " I will bring him into the longhouse when I wish to re-turn . " " As you will . What will you do now , Merrik ? " " I want an island like my brother Rorik 's . " She laughed . It was a pure , rich sound , no mockery in it . He realized he 'd never heard her laugh before , not like this , honest and open . Not that she 'd had reason , of course . He opened his eyes . " I amuse you ? " " Where would you get an island ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thought , just a quick answer to your insolent question . " She stiffened , but he did n't care . She deserved his sharp tongue . She turned away from him and walked away . He closed his eyes again and pulled Taby closer . He felt the child 's palm on his heart . There was a feast to celebrate Merrik 's return , but it was n't like the one of the year before or the year before that . There was mead and beer to drink , cheese , cabbage , onions , peas , wild boar steaks , dark pink salmon LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 115  | well smoked and delicious , flatbread and rye bread and apples both sweet and tart . Sarla spread a beautiful pale linen cloth on the wide wooden table . Laren looked at it and felt a sudden unexpected surge of tears . There had always been such finery in her life until that awful night : beautiful cloths to spread over surfaces , exquisite furnishings , huge spaces , not dark and low and filled with smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter as she spread a beautiful linen cloth on a table , how she 'd complained that the men did n't care , but she did , so it did n't matter . Such beautiful cloths , their edges beautifully embroidered . She had n't thought of her mother in more months than she could count . It was strange . Her mother 's name was Nirea , a soft name , a name that was like music to say . " What may I do ? " she said . " You will eat , Laren , that is all you may do until you are stronger . " " She is a slave , " Erik said , coming up behind her . " Give her tasks to perform , Sarla . You are mistress here , it is time you acted like one . " Sarla said calmly , without hesitation , " There are spoons in the soapstone bowl on the ledge yon . Please place them beside the plates , Laren . " Erik grunted and went out . Laren felt anger rise from deep inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a tyrant , a bully , proud because of his bloodline . He was a man who would be beyond dangerous were there not others to restrain him . She wondered how much Erik had tempered his swaggering and commands when his father had been alive and master here at Malverne . The feast passed off well enough , Merrik supposed , sipping on the sweet mead that Sarla made so very well . His mother had taught her just about everything else ,  | he remembered , but not how to make mead . He complimented her . Erik said , " There is too much honey in it for my taste . " " It is perfect , " Merrik said . " What think you , Oleg ? " " I will drink ten more cups and then tell you . " There was only a chuckle or two , but it was a start . Erik said , " After we have supped , Deglin will tell us a tale , perhaps about my young brother 's brave exploits in Kiev . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with darting glances . The men murmured and fidgeted , waiting for Merrik to speak . Erik raised a blond eyebrow , staring first at Merrik , then down the long table to Deglin . Merrik said mildly , " Deglin tells us no more tales , Erik . He has discovered he no longer enjoys being a skald . " " Aye , " Eller said quickly . " He trained another , this girl here . It is she who now tells us stories . " Erik said , " That is nonsense . She is a girl , naught more . She can not ? " " You will listen to her before you make your pro-nouncements . " Erik looked as if he would clout his brother , but he did n't . He subsided in his chair  --  what had been his father 's chair  --  his face flushed , his eyes narrowed . He now looked at Laren , who was sitting beside Old Firren . " You fancy yourself a skald , girl ? " She looked up at him , and regarded him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . She shrugged then and it enraged him . " I fancy myself nothing at all . You will tell me , aye , doubtless you will tell me what I am . " Sarla sucked in her breath . She was seated next to LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 117  | her husband , and felt the quick rage pulsing through him . She said quickly , her voice too loud , fright sounding through , she knew it , but could n't prevent it , " Do you like the herring , my lord ? Roran Black Eye caught it just this afternoon . " Erik forced his eyes away from the female slave . " Roran always has luck with the fish , " he said , and drank deeply of the mead . So it was that after the interminable meal , Laren was asked to stand before them and begin the tale of Grunlige the Dane from the beginning . She saw Deglin leave from the corner of her eye and was relieved . Just looking at him brought a wave of pain to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he blamed her for it . She thought of silver coins , took a sip of beer , smiled at all the assembled company and said , " Once there was a valiant warrior whose name was Grunlige the Dane . " She embellished the beginning of the story so that all of Rorik 's men were sitting close now , listening carefully , all their low conversation stilled . " ... And when Parma leaned down to grab Selina , when his hands touched her arms , something very strange happened . " She paused apurpose , looking at each man and woman and child  --  those children who were still awake . Her eyes sparkled , she leaned close , as if about to tell a secret , she wet her lips with her tongue . It was Oleg who said finally , " Enough , girl ! Tell us else I will steal your beer and you will have no more for two seasons ! " The men cheered and Eller said loudly , " Give the girl a chance . I smell a good tale acoming. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with emotion , " Aye , when Parma touched Selina 's arms , he felt as though Thor himself had sent a bolt of lightning through him . He fell back , trembling , and suddenly he was brutally cold , his hands shaking . His hands felt seared , pain surging through them , yet there were no marks on them . They felt numb , then they ached and throbbed . He looked from his hands to Selina . She said quietly , I told you not to touch me . ' " As the moments passed , so did his memory of his fear , the memory of the strange scorching pain in his hands , the cold that was surely colder than death itself , and he was angry now , unwilling to believe that something strange had indeed happened , something that he had n't seen or understood . He snarled at her and leapt upon her , throwing her to her back on the rocky ground . Still , she did n't scream , did n't try to struggle against him . He lay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips , for his was an evil grin , a triumphant grin , and he said , There was nothing strange , to well up within me , nothing foreign .

' " No sooner were the words out of his mouth than he felt himself lifted bodily off her . What man had the strength to lift him and hold him like this ? Like he were naught but a small child ? He tried to jerk free , but could not . No , he hovered over her , not more than six feet above her , looking down at her , stunned , unspeaking , words clogging in his throat .

' " He kicked and thrashed about , but he continued to go higher and there was naught he could do about it . He was shrieking now with fear , struggling wildly against the unknown force that was holding him , yet even as he tried to turn onto his back , he was not able to . His body seemed frozen there , staring down at Selina , who was growing smaller and smaller , and he knew she was still smiling at him . " He shrieked and shrieked . He wanted his release but he knew , too , if he were released he would die , for he would plummet back to the ground and be crushed against the rocks . Suddenly , without warning , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty hand , and now he was no longer hovering over Selina , he was moving swiftly to the east . Then there was water beneath him , a vast sea of water , and his fear was so great that he could n't begin to understand what was happening to him . She must have cursed him , he thought , clinging to that , aye , she was a witch and none of this was really happening , it was a vision , an illusion  | brought on by her witch 's curse . He would find her and he would kill her , but all he did was move more quickly , shoved southward now by that mighty force . He was in the clouds and he could n't see through the white haze , and he was cold , shivering , his flesh blue , as blue as Grunlige 's hands had been after he 'd shredded all the ice floes . He remembered Selina 's words . He damned her for a witch just as she 'd damned him . He would die here , high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all because of a curse from a woman he would kill if only he could find her again . " Then , very slowly , he began to descend from the sky . The air grew warmer and he felt himself once more able to think , to see , to reason . He could see the earth clearly , the rocks , a narrow stream , the brilliant green of the grass . He was not plummeting downward , but gliding smoothly and slowly , ah , he felt like a magician , and began to wonder if it had been he who had raised himself , if he had finally come into his own . Aye , it had to have been he who had climbed upward and begun to fly . " He believed this , now smiling as he drew closer to the ground . He was warm again , feeling the blood course through him . He waved his arms about to change his direction . He changed direction . He laughed aloud with his marvelous discovery . Ah , there was nothing he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He kicked his feet and rushed forward through the silent warm air , then slowed . He laughed aloud and set about to test his new abilities . But before he could wave his arms again or kick his feet , he fell like a stone the remaining short distance to the ground , as if he 'd been released and thrown downward , landing at the feet of a large bearskin-clad man , a warrior , perLORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 121  | haps even a berserker , huge and strong , a mighty sword held in a bandaged hand . " That warrior was Grunlige the Dane . His hands were still bandaged , but he seemed to hold that sword easily . He stood straight and tall , as proud as he had been before the tragedy had struck him . And he said , You are Parma and you dared to touch my wife . Do you know what I will do to you ? ' " Parma stared up at Grunlige , openmouthed in disbelief . He shook his head dumbly , unwilling to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gained courage . He said , his voice brash and arrogant , You should be dead . You went off to die . You are dead . You are merely some remnant of a man , some lost shadow that has yet to fade into oblivion . This is naught but your shell , for you are nothing , just a voice and an illusion propped up by the air that surrounds us . I have raided your holdings , stolen your cattle , and plundered your ships . You were not there when your men cried out for your help . " Now we are far away from your homeland and mine . What is this place ? Where are we ? You can not be Grunlige , for he stands not tall and proud anymore . He is pathetic , probably dead now by his own hand . ' " Grunlige stared down at him , unmoving , and smiled . Shall I tell you , Parma , exactly what I am and where we are ? What would you like to hear first , you vile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then I will come back and slay you ! ' Parma jumped to his feet , flapped his arms , but nothing happened . He climbed atop a high rock and jumped off , flailing his arms wildly , kicking his feet . He heard Grunlige the Dane laugh , a laugh as wicked and frightening as a laugh from the Christians ' hell . Parma did n't soar into the heavens , he fell hard  | once again at Grunlige 's feet . He screamed with rage , It is the witch again ! She has stolen my powers . Damn her for all time ! ' " Grunlige said very softly , even as he raised his foot above Parma 's head , Heed me , fool . You have no powers , only vanity and guilt and a stupid man 's arrogance . Now you will gain what you deserve . " Laren stopped . She smiled at the men and women and children , all of whom were staring at her , their attention focused solely on her . Cleve was smiling and nodding at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Erik bellowed . " I grow tired of your waiting ! Damn you , what happened ? What did Grunlige do ? Did he send his foot into Parma 's skull ? Where in the name of the gods are they ? " She shook her head . " I am but a woman , my lord Erik , and must rest now . Forgive me . My brain and my throat are sore and need to recover . Perhaps by tomorrow night I will be able to continue . " There were murmurs of protest , and Erik looked as though he would explode , for even as a child , he would sit before the skald listening so intently that their mother could call him and he would not hear her . Merrik laughed as he rose , and said quickly , " Nay , all of you be quiet . It is her way . She stops not because she has any supposed weakness of a woman , nay , she leaves you purposely dangling , hooked like bait on a fishing line . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well but you really do n't care what happens next . It will drive her mad with doubts and make her less arrogant in her skills . " He laughed again and turned to Erik . " Well , brother , what do you think of my new skald , my female skald ? " Erik just looked at Laren . Suddenly , Merrik did n't like the way he was gazing so intently at her . He did n't LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 123  | want that kind of trouble . By all the gods , he did n't want to have to quarrel with his brother , tell him to leave her alone , but he would have to if Erik decided he wanted to bed Laren . He did n't know why he would have to , but he knew he would . He looked at Sarla , who was , in turn , staring at her husband . She knew , Merrik thought , she knew . Indeed , it was difficult for her not to know . Two of Erik 's bastards were here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet gained a year . But Kenna was strong and healthy and the very image of his father . And their mothers were there , too , and as far as Merrik knew , both Megot and Caylis still shared his brother 's bed . But Sarla had no children as yet . She and Erik had been wed for two years now and as yet her belly had n't swelled with child . Merrik sighed . He did n't like this . He walked to Cleve and held out his arms for Taby . He gathered the child to him , then went to search out some blankets , Taby held securely in the crook of his arm . He saw Laren looking at him . It was the first night he had kept Taby with him . He walked to her and said , " I will see to Taby tonight . " He paused a moment , studying her upturned face . Her face was flushed from the heat and from her success . He smiled at her , and to his surprise , she smiled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth of it all the way to his belly . Yet he wanted to see her smile again and yet again . But not now , not at him . So he turned away , saying as he did so , " You will stay close to the longhouse . Remain by Sarla 's side . I will decide where we will go soon . " In her hand were seven small silver pieces . She closed her fist over them , holding them close . They tingled against her flesh . Perhaps they were enough to buy her freedom and Taby 's and Cleve 's . She said , " I would speak to you , Merrik , perhaps on the morrow . It is im-  | portant . " Then she was uncertain . She had eleven pieces of silver . Surely that was a lot of silver , but she had no idea what she or Cleve were worth in the slave market . " Perhaps I can speak to you not tomorrow , but later , perhaps in three or four days . Or perhaps I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . " She 'd said nothing about Taby , sleeping soundly , now cupped in one of his arms against his shoulder , and that surprised him . " Your meaning is as clear as a piece of bog ore . Nay , do n't try to confuse me or yourself more . Now , I would have a promise from you . Do you swear you will stay close to the longhouse and to Sarla ? " She frowned at him , then nodded , not understanding . He knew she did n't , but said nothing more . Early the next morning when she went to relieve her-self ' , she came out of the privy to see Erik standing there , his hands on his hips . " I have been waiting for you , " he said , and he smiled at her . " Why ? " lie frowned and she quickly added , " My lord . " " That is better . I am the lord of Malverne and you are naught but a slave . It is good you do n't forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still much too thin , but I shall take care not to grind myself against your bones . " " Why would you wish to do that ? " But she knew what he wanted now , she recognized the lust in his eyes , and his supreme confidence . He wanted her and he would have her , and she recognized the certainty in him . But she would feign ignorance until she could think of something , anything .. . " Actually , Merrik tells me you are still very thin but you do n't look thin with your gown and tunic covering  | you . I will remove your clothes , look at you and study you and decide for myself . " Still , she merely cocked her head to the side and looked at him like a questioning half-wit . " My lord , I will go assist your wife now . I make an excellent por-ridge . " " You will assist no one but me , Laren . " He took a step toward her now and Laren quickly took a step back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am lord here , and if I want to bed you I will bed you . You have no say in the matter . But still , I am a man of handsome parts and there is no reason why you would n't want me to touch you and caress you . " Ah , she thought , but the parts did n't add up into a handsome whole . She said hesitantly , looking beyond his left shoulder , " I can not , my lord . I am Merrik 's slave , his possession . I am his concubine . You must ask him if you wish to share me with him . " That drew Erik up short . He frowned . " My brother said nothing about keeping you . You have n't slept with him . By all the gods , he sleeps with your little brother , or alone . You lie , wench . He does n't want you . He even told me so . He said he took you only because you were the child 's sister . " She felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep she thought she 'd strangle with it , but she managed to say calmly enough , " It is my monthly flow . Merrik does n't like to touch me at those times . " " I am surprised my brother would let such a simple thing deter him . As for me , I do n't care . " Erik took another step toward her . She shook her head even as she eased to her left , toward the longhouse . To her unspeakable relief , one of Erik 's men , Sturla by name , a huge man with arms larger than her legs , bulging with muscle , came strid-  | ing from the longhouse . He said , " The men are ready , Erik . The boar was seen just late yesterday and I know we can find it . I have promised Sarla she will have it to make us boar steaks this very night . " She wanted to kiss the huge man , who could , if he wished , kill her with one blow from his immense hand . Erik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cursed quietly . It was obvious he 'd forgotten about the boar hunt . Ile said nothing , merely turned to Sturla . " Let us be off , then . " He said over his shoulder to her , " I will see to you this night . You will not gainsay me . " Laren said not a word . She waited , unmoving , until Erik disappeared through the palisade gates with six of his men . A woman said from behind her , " I heard Merrik warn you , yet you came out here alone . Do you not heed your master 's warnings ? " Laren said nothing , just continued staring after Erik and Sturla until all the men were gone from view . The woman continued , " Erik will have you , despite your wishes , despite his brother 's wishes . " Laren turned slowly to face a young woman with brilliant blue eyes and blond hair that looked filled with the morning sunlight . She was taller than most women , deep bosomed and well garbed . Laren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a thing done with others . Who are you ? " " I am Caylis . Erik has kept me for nine years now . His father bought me when I was only thirteen years old to assist his wife and to be a companion to their niece Sira . Erik wanted me and took me . My son is eight years old now . He is Kenna , a good boy , strong and proud . If Sarla has no children , then Erik will doubtless make him legitimate . I pray it will happen . I have borne him three other children , all girls , but they died . " LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 127  | " But Erik is wedded to Sarla . " " Aye , the poor little weak fool . Over two years now . ' T was a marriage arranged by Erik 's father , Harald . She has n't the guile to hold him , to make him do what she wants him to do . She is timorous as a newly foaled calf . " She paused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whilst his parents still lived . He only visited my bed and the other women 's after his parents had departed to their sleeping chamber for the night . He knew they were fond of Sarla , so he did nothing untoward toward us whilst they were about . But now he has no reason to deny himself anything . He can do whatever he pleases , and for whatever reason , he wants you . I suppose it is because you are new , and like all men , Erik will seek to bend you to his will until he has bedded you and discovers that you are but like the rest of us , only not as pretty or as well made . " Laren did n't say anything , but as she lifted her skirt , she smiled at the woman . Caylis sucked in her breath . " Your leg  --  it 's horrible ! " " Aye , I burned myself . I will show your lord Erik . Perhaps that will cool his ardor . " Caylis just shook her head . " So you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Erik . Merrik is a beautiful man , I have many times remarked on it . Is he a good lover or does he just want you to pleasure him and watch whilst his face flushes with his own passion ? Does Merrik care what you feel ? " Laren stared at her . Caylis laughed . " So , you have n't bedded with him . Resign yourself , then . It is Erik who will have your virginity . It is n't bad , if he is in a pleasant mood . If he is n't , you will know much pain . Sometimes he enjoys pain , sometimes not . You will learn soon enough what it is he will want from you . " It is a pity that Merrik has no power here now . Erik  | will grant him none . If Erik wants you , he will have you . Do you really make an excellent porridge ? Sarla does n't . Come , then , for I am quite hungry . " That night , replete with the delicious boar steaks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the tale of Grunlige the Dane . Laren thought first of the silver coins , then of what would come after . She knew that Erik would come to her tonight . She simply did n't know what to do about it . First , she would tell her story , then she would decide . She rose and rubbed her hands together , saying nothing until all attention was on her . " I will tell you who and what I am , ' Grunlige said , his foot poised over Par-ma 's neck . I am still myself and none other . I am not a shade from the nether regions . I am flesh and bone , but I have gone beyond a mere man 's flesh and bones to a higher realm . But mistake me not , Parma , I am still myself and Selina is still my beloved wife . You see my hands are still bandaged . That was for you to remark upon and feel superior about . ' " Grunlige slowly unwrapped the bandages from his hands . Parma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shriveled like claws , fingernails twisted and blackened . No , his hands were whole and clean and strong , and the sword handle fit well into his palm . " Your witch wife , she brought you back , ' Parma gasped , so frightened now , he felt his bladder loosen and knew great shame for his fear . " Nay , ' t was Odin All-Father , ' Grunlige said matter-of-factly . He deemed me worthy , deemed my people worthy , and thus restored me . You are a fool , Parma , do you not recognize where you are ? ' " Parma gazed about him , but he recognized nothing . Then he saw Selina walking toward them , her white robe flowing , her shoulders proud , her walk confident . LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 129  | " You have gone nowhere , Parma . You are still here where you attacked my wife . Odin but played with you , teased you , and you were a fool . Now , what have you to say for yourself ? ' " Parma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep his life . He said , If you are truly a hero , if Odin All-Father truly deemed you brave and worthy , why then go perform a deed that would prove your greatness . Do not crush my neck with your foot . That would be nothing , it would be more the act of a coward . Aye , go , Grunlige , and prove yourself . Go in a vessel into the seas east of Iceland . Once again , shred the ice floes , once again , aye , and see if you are truly the gallant hero you believe yourself to be . ' " Selina cried out , Listen not to him , Grunlige ! His tongue is wily and he wants only to mock you , to make you lose your sense of what is right ! Do n't heed him ! ' " But Grunlige had lifted his foot from Parma 's neck . He stepped away from Parma , who did n't move at all , who resembled a statue , so still did he lie . Grunlige gazed upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shouted , Odin ! Hear me , oh mighty lord of the heavens and of all warriors ! I will go again to prove myself and when I return you must grant me what it is I deserve ! ' " Suddenly , a great white flash of lightning streaked through the sky , turning the air itself to vapor . Again and again there was that sheer white filling the air , filling their lungs . It was followed by crash after crash of thunder that shook the ground itself . Selina fell to her knees , burying her face in her hands . Parma felt fear , but now he also felt hope . He stared at Grunlige . " Grunlige was smiling . I hear you , Odin . I go to prove myself yet again to you . ' " Before he strode away , he grasped Parma by the  | throat and hauled him upright . He shook him until Parma believed his neck would break apart from his body . Grunlige said , If you touch my wife again or any of my belongings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh from your body . I will then fling you onto an ice floe and there your seeping blood will freeze and you will know more agony than a man can bear . ' " He strode to his wife , drew her to her feet and embraced her . Then he was gone , his shoulders straight and strong , his stride quick and sure . " Laren stopped then , and smiled , first down at her clasped hands , then at each of her audience in turn . " I will not accept this dithering , " Erik shouted at her . " Finish the damned tale ! Finish it ! " She just shook her head . It was Sturla , Erik 's huge warrior , who said now , " Nay , my lord , leave her be . I like this suspense , it teases my wits and makes me wonder what will happen next . Aye , perhaps tomorrow night she will continue the tale . Mayhap she will even finish it for us . " Erik subsided . He sat in his lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come through the family for two hundred years . The oak was smooth as silk with the many fingers that had stroked it , but the images of Odin and Thor and Frey were still clear , the expressions on their carved faces still sharp . He waited , was content to wait . He watched Sarla dismiss the slaves , watched all the children herded off to the small sleeping chamber where they slept , watched his men and Merrik 's men roll themselves into blankets . He waited until all was nearly silent . He prepared to rise , but stopped . Merrik was walking to where Laren was lying near the fire pit , her blanket wrapped closely around her , Taby tucked in the curve of her belly . He came down beside her on his haunches.  | He said low so as not to awaken Taby , " You are my concubine , I have heard said today . I think it is the only thing that might save you from my brother 's lust . You will give Taby to Cleve and come with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She stared up at him in the dim light cast by the dying embers . " Will you hurt me ? " " I will look at your leg and at your back and probably apply more healing cream to both . Then we will see . " " I do n't want you to see , " she said . " I do n't want to be your concubine , Merrik , ' t is just that I could think of nothing else to say . " " I know , but you are the one who said it . Therefore we must continue as you began , else Erik will be beside you within another instant . Well ? What do you wish ? " She did n't look at him , just said calmly , " Where is Cleve ? " Merrik smiled at her . " I will fetch him . "  | ERIK STOOD OVER her , oblivious of his brother and their people who stood near . " Give the child over and come with me . " " I fear she can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleve . " Take Taby for the night . I would keep his sister with me . " Cleve said nothing as he gathered up the sleeping child , nor did Laren . She waited there on the floor , wrapped in her blanket , watching the two men . " I want her , " Erik said , and she heard the petulance , the covetousness in his voice . " She is my concubine and she is my slave as well , Erik . When I tire of her , I will consider selling her to you . Come along , Laren . " " She said you did n't want her because it was her monthly flow . She said you would n't want her until she had finished it . And I 've watched you , Merrik , you have n't touched her , even scarce looked at her since you came home . All you care about is that damned boy . " Merrik said slowly , consciously relaxing his hands from fists at his sides , " It is true that I like not taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need and thus will make do . I try not to look at her , because whenever I do it makes my lust rise . I do not like to torment myself . LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 133  | But tonight I will not wait longer . It is my will that prevails here , for she is my slave , not yours . I bid you good night , brother . I see Sarla awaiting you . " " Damn you , Merrik , ' t is not just that I want to plow her belly , I would have her tell me what happened to Grunlige the Dane ! " If she had n't been so afraid , Laren would have laughed . " She will tell you tomorrow night , Erik . " Merrik reached out his hand , and without hesitation , she placed her own in his . He pulled her upright . She fell forward , against his chest , and he laughed a little , stroking her hair with familiarity as he did so . He held her there as he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So thin you would look at her only once and tell her to leave you . Also , her hair is short and ragged , as you see , not as full and thick like your wife 's or your mis-tresses ' . " Laren heard a laugh and knew it was from the woman Caylis . She saw Sarla from the corner of her eye . How could Erik shame his wife like this ? It enraged her . Before she could say anything , Merrik leaned down and kissed her hard . The shock of it rendered her immediately silent . He laughed again , gave his brother a small salute , and picked her up in his arms . She did n't move , barely breathed in fact until he laid her upon the box bed that had belonged to his brother before their parents had died . The chamber was small and dark . Merrik cursed under his breath , left the chamber , and soon returned with a lit oil lamp . There were wool blankets on the bed and atop those were otter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a beautiful  | large chest at the foot of the bed , nothing else . Merrik walked to the entrance of the chamber , pulled the skin aside and looked out . Erik was nowhere to be seen . Hopefully he was with Sarla . All was quiet , save for the snores from some of the men and the few moans and giggles from the men and women enjoying themselves before sleep came . He cursed again , and once more left the chamber . Laren did n't move , just stared at the bearskin that covered the entrance . When he came back there was a soapstone jar in his hand . Ile said briefly , " The cream for your back and leg . Take off your clothes . " She did n't move . " Why did you kiss me ? " " For my brother 's benefit . To show him my possession of you . " " But everyone was watching . " I le shrugged , and said matter-of-factly , " I know . It will keep Erik 's men away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired and wish to sleep . " She did n't want to take off her clothes in front of him , did n't want to repel him with her thinness . It had n't mattered to her before but it did now for the simple reason that now she cared what he thought . No , she did n't want to have to obey that command . It was as if she did n't matter , who she was and what she was  --  it was entirely unimportant to him . It was Taby he wanted , not her , Taby he cared about , not her . Erik was right about that . She said nothing to him , nothing at all . She tried to remember that if he had n't saved her from Thrasco , she would surely be dead now . But that was n't true . She had escaped from Thrasco on her own . She would have managed . She owed him only for saving Taby . She did n't know what to do . LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 135  | She wanted very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course he would never kiss her freely , never because he wanted to , never because of desire for her . Quite simply , there was no one for her , no one save a five-year-old child . Suddenly the terror of the last two years , of the endless weeks that had flowed into months and beyond , that endless time of hopelessness , of rage and fury that had eaten at her deeply and more deeply still as time passed , it all welled up in her then and she felt herself crushed under the weight of it . It erupted and she could n't prevent it . She began to sob , deep ugly sobs that shook her whole body . She buried her face in her hands , hating the ugly sounds that showed him her weakness , but the wave upon wave of grinding pain would n't cease . The helplessness , the fear , the bitterness , all were there , pulling at her , defeating her . She tried desperately to gain control , for she did n't want him to see how pathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but the sobs were deeper now , a part of her , and they would n't stop . Merrik stood by the bed simply staring down at her . His first thought was that Erik had terrified her . Then he knew that was n't the case . She was n't some gutless female . No , she was a survivor . Surely Erik 's lust would have no effect on her , at least not this effect . But she sounded as if her very world had ended . He set the cream on the bed , sat down , and without a word , pulled her into his arms . He rubbed his large hands down her back , only to remember that her back must still be sore from the beating Thrasco had given her . He rubbed her scalp , just holding her with one arm loose around her back . He said things to her , words that had little meaning to him , to her , just words , but their tone was gentle and reassuring , and he supposed ,  | vaguely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be holding Taby , stroking him , telling him everything would be all right because he , Merrik , was here now and he would take care of him , he would protect him with his life . She moved against him and then he felt her breasts . She was n't a child and he felt like a fool . No , she was n't a child and he felt a surge of lust for her . It was unexpected and he did n't like it . She was Taby 's sister . It was just that it had been a long time since he 'd had a woman , too long . But , of course , he remembered the softness of her , the feel of her when she 'd hugged herself to him in Kaupang . He did n't intend it , but he kissed her temple , felt her soft hair tickle his cheek , his nose . " It 's all right , " he said again , but now his voice was deep and hoarse with his burgeoning need . " I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she hiccuped . His hands came around to close around her chin and he lifted her face . Tears were wet on her cheeks and she was gulping for breath . Her eyes and nose were red , her hair was loose from its braids and straggling over her forehead . She looked as appetizing as a gutted herring , and he thought she was the most beautiful woman he 'd ever seen . And he wanted her . In that moment , he forgot Taby , forgot that this was Taby 's sister . He leaned forward and kissed her . The second time . He tasted the salty tears , and something else , something sweet and dark and mysterious , something that had no part of either of them separately , but something that was both magical and an odd enchantment when he touched her mouth , when the two of them came together . It was something he 'd never exLORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 137  | perienced before ; it was something he wanted for himself , and he wanted it badly . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here alone with him . She belonged to him . She was n't moving . Yet he wanted her even more now . He kissed her again , harder this time , willing her to part her lips , but he realized suddenly that she very probably had no idea what to do . And that stopped him cold . She was innocent in deed , if not in what she had witnessed during the last two years . She did n't know how to kiss him . He started to say something , to pull away from her , but suddenly , she leaned forward , her hand came up to touch his cheek , and she kissed him . Her lips were soft and firmly together and she just pressed them to his mouth , but it was a kiss and it was she who was freely offering it . A virgin 's kiss . He opened his mouth slightly and let the tip of his tongue lightly touch her mouth . She jumped . Then , to his surprise and pleasure , she leaned into him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt the surge of lust throughout his body , not just his groin . He was swelled and ready , but that was n't all there was to it . He felt that mystery again , felt that something deep and still hidden from him , felt it moving within him , pushing him toward her , and knowing even as he felt those odd feelings that coming together with her would change his life . He fought it even as it swamped him , lured him toward her . Surely she was just a woman , and he 'd known many women , but at the same time , she was just herself and like none other . He drew away from that . It struck fear in him , for he believed a man must remain unto himself and not give himself over to anyone else , particularly a woman , particularly this woman who was scarce a woman really ,  | just a girl who was so thin that surely she would n't have the strength to take him as a man , and she was Taby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . He had not saved her to hurt her . No , he saved her because she was Taby 's sister , nothing more , nothing less . Suddenly , he saw her as he 'd seen her so long ago now , aye , ages ago , it seemed , yet not really , but he saw her very clearly in his mind 's eye  --  the ragged boy , defeated yet as proud and defiant as he was himself , standing there , helpless , in the slave pit of Khagan-Rus . No , he 'd looked at her and looked again and he knew now that what he had felt was different , for she had touched him with the essence of herself . He would never be free of her just . as he would never be free of Taby . He supposed that right now , at just this moment , he did n't want to be free of her , did n't want to rail against it and try to protect himself , for his lust for her was grinding him down . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no rape here . If he hurt her because of her thinness , so be it . He would try not to , but .. . He pulled her down and came over her . The feel of her beneath him made him want to shout and groan and come into her , all in the same instant . His hand was wild on the skirt of her gown , and he was jerking it up , his movements frantic . His fingers scraped against her bare leg and she jerked and cried out . At first , he did n't realize what had happened . Then he knew . He 'd hit her burned leg and hurt her . He drew a deep breath , feeling his whole body shudder with the force of the control he was trying to find within himself . Her breasts were heaving against him , but now it was n't desire or even a girl 's excitement in the unknown , it was the pain he 'd just brought her . He gathLORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 139  | ered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry . Damnation , I hurt you . I have the cream . Hold still and soon the pain will lessen . " Laren lay there , breathing hard from the curious mixture of intense pain and feelings that she herself could n't begin to describe . She just knew that she 'd never felt such things before , in such places , and it was wonderful and she wanted them again . She did n't want them ever to stop . She did n't want him to stop , but he had because he 'd hurt her . She looked at him now and he was flushed , his hands none too steady . She felt his fingers , chill with the cream , lightly touch her leg and she gasped , the pain making all the other feelings recede . She tried not to cry out , but she could n't help it . He said nothing , just looked up at her and saw that she was crying and her eyes were closed , the tears just seeping from beneath her lashes and trailing down her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her still-red flesh . He gently rubbed in the cream . Actually , her leg looked much better . If there would be scarring , it would be slight . He began a gentle rhythmic motion and stuck to it . His desire was nearly gone , and for that he was grateful . He would find a woman this night and drain his desire so this would n't happen again . Then he realized he could not leave her , could not leave this sleeping chamber . He was in here with his concubine and none must doubt it , least of all his brother . " How is your back ? " She got control of herself . No more damnable tears , no more weak moans and groans . The cream was leaching out the pain . She could manage it now . " My back is fine , Merrik . My leg is better too . " He should look at her back , but the thought of her  | naked made his belly seize with cramps . But he 'd seen her naked before and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he 'd kissed her and held her hard against him and touched his tongue to her lips , to her tongue , breathed in the scent of her , felt the wondrous feelings that had passed between them , locking them together in that brief instant of time . It was beyond what he could understand or accept . He had n't come inside her ; he had n't spilled his seed in her and come to his release . No , it was just the simple kissing , the holding of her close to him , and those simple acts had brought him to the edge . He had never lost himself before , certainly not with the simple matter of sex , certainly not in the simple things that came before sex . It would n't happen to him now . It would never happen to him . Ile would n't allow it . He would look at her back , rub in more of the cream if necessary , and it would be as it had been before . But he would n't kiss her again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , his voice so stiff and cold it surprised him more than it did her , " I will help you off with your clothes . I will look at your back . You know nothing , for you ca n't see yourself . Now , stop arguing with me . " Actually , she had n't said a word . He helped her sit on the side of the box bed . He untied the knots of the tunic at her shoulders and pulled it over her head . He unlaced the front of her gown and eased it down to her waist . She wore only a plain linen shift beneath , the one he 'd bought for her at the market in Kaupang . He did n't want to notice but he did . It was tight on her , her breasts crushed against the material . He knew he had to get her onto her stomach quickly . Once she was facedown , he pulled her gown and her shift down to her waist . He brought the oil lamp closer . LORD OF RAVEN 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still clear , long narrow marks that crisscrossed her back . The ugly redness had given over to pale pink now , there was no puffiness , no red angry or dark lines radiating out from the marks , or any other sign of illness . Still , the cream could n't hurt . He scooped up two fingers full of cream and began to massage her back . She was stiff as a board , but he said nothing , just continued to rub her , his touch lightly stroking . Soon , he felt her ease . Soon after that she moaned with the pleasure of it and he had to smile . He should rub in the cream every night . Her body was tense too and he rubbed her shoulders . She moaned again . He pushed the gown lower on her hips . He did n't know why he 'd done it , for he knew that Thrasco 's whip had n't struck that low on her body . He just wanted to see her , see how much flesh she 'd added during the weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ribs , but there was a woman 's softness there now as well and her white hips were full enough , and he thought he 'd spill his seed . From laughter to such lust he thought he 'd yell with it . Quickly he pulled her gown back to her waist and rose . He put the cream on the floor beside the bed . He would sleep in the same bed with her , next to her , he had to , else he had no doubt that his brother would be there in an instant . He would not allow Erik to rape Taby 's sister . It was that simple . Nor would he allow himself to seduce Taby 's sister . He said very quietly , " I am going to pull your gown off you and your shift . I will lay one of my clean tunics over your back . All right , Laren ? " She said nothing , merely nodded . Her hair had fallen over her cheek so at least she knew he could n't see her  | face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd felt excited . She did n't understand why she had n't yelled or hurled curses at him when he 'd pulled her gown to her hips , but she had n't said a word , had n't made a single sound . And now she felt like a fool , a blind , quite stupid fool . Her back and leg were beyond ugly , and she 'd forgotten that . She was still too thin . Aye , about as appetizing as a goose carcass . He 'd wanted her only as long as he 'd forgotten what she really looked like . She felt tears sting her eyes again , but these were n't tears that had built and built inside her for two years . These were tears that showed how miserable she felt right at this moment , with this man who did n't want her , in this hopeless situation . She let him strip off her clothes . She felt the soft tunic spread across her back . Then , very quickly , she felt him smooth a wool blanket over her . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't do that to you again . " And she knew what he meant . She said , her voice devoid of all feeling , " It is because I am so very thin and ugly . " " No , " he said . " It is because of Taby . " And again , she knew what he meant . lie knew he had n't spoken the truth . No , it was not just because of Taby . He had no intention of shaming her and that is what would happen if he took her . Ah , but let Erik believe she was his concubine , let him listen , hoping to hear moans from her to prove that she was . Erik had to believe it . He did n't want to have to face the situation that would result from any doubt . The following day passed quickly . At every opportunity , Merrik was giving her food , standing over her until she 'd eaten every morsel he 'd dished out .  | Taby was playing with the other children now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caylis , was a particular hero . He followed Kenna everywhere . Kenna , a handsome lad who did n't seem to have his father 's meanness or arrogance , treated Taby with good-natured tolerance . The other children followed his lead . Cleve was the one in an odd position . He was a slave , yet he did n't sleep in the slave hut , nor did he perform menial tasks . Merrik kept him with him and his men when they hunted that afternoon . Laren counted her silver coins . She now had eighteen . Soon now , she would ask Merrik . She 'd forgotten to speak to him the previous night . Too much had happened , far too much , and she knew she and Taby and Cleve had to leave soon . In weak moments , like right now , she did n't want to leave Merrik any more than Taby did , but she had to get them away from here . Neither of them belonged here . She cooked that evening , making a stew from boar meat that brought satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Malverne people . After the meal , Erik looked at Laren , and there was lust and meanness in his eyes . He said , ' We wo n't have the girl continue her foolish tale tonight . I have other matters I wish to see to . " So Laren would gain no more silver pieces that night . She assumed that Erik believed he was punishing her . She did n't care . Sarla touched her sleeve . " The stew was the best I have ever eaten . You must teach me , Laren , you must . " Sarla had spoken sharply , urgently , and Laren turned to her , frowning . " It is simple , truly . Your cooking is just as good , mine is simply different . " " Nay , you must show me. "  | Laren looked at her closely , very closely , and for the first time she saw the faint bruise that was beneath Sarla 's right eye . Fury curdled her belly . " By all the gods , he struck you ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet . It 's nothing of anything , truly . It does n't hurt , and you ca n't see it unless you look very closely . Be quiet . " " Why did he strike you ? " Sarla said nothing . She merely shrugged . " Why ? " ? " Erik does n't need reasons for his actions . I displeased him and he hit me . " " Has he hit you before ? " Sarla looked at her then , and there was pity in her fine gray eyes . " I seem to displease him more and more as the days and weeks go by . " Laren knew that men hit women  --  their wives , their concubines , their slaves , it did n't seem to matter . But Sarla was so quiet and kind . How could she possibly displease anyone ? And then she knew why Erik had struck his gentle wife . It was because he 'd been thwarted ; he 'd wanted her , Laren , and Merrik had forestalled him . " Your look is violent , Laren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just forget this . Besides , I saw him speaking earlier to Caylis and then to Megot  --  she is the beautiful girl over there near the loom speaking to Ileria , the one with the pale brown hair . It is likely he will leave me alone now . " Laren held her peace , but it was difficult . " You are angry . " Laren was making bread the following morning , for the men had eaten every single loaf she 'd made the previous day . She plunged her hands in the trough full of  | dough , up to her elbows . She looked up at Cleve and forced a smile . " Nay , not really angry . It 's just that Sarla is very kind and gentle . Her husband is n't . " " He is a man who enjoys being the master . He dislikes any to disagree with him . I have heard that since his father died , he has become more reckless in his actions . It makes him feel important and powerful to know he can hurt or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whim . " " At least Sarla was spared his attention last night . " " Aye , she was . She slept in the outer chamber . Near me . " Laren sighed and dug deeper into the dough , kneading it furiously . The flour had n't been ground as well as it could have been and she felt the grit between her fingers . She would have to see about that . She remembered her owner in Staraya Ladoga , that foul-tempered old woman who had , at least , taught her how to cook and grind flour properly and make beer and ale . She 'd learned quickly , just as she 'd told Merrik , for the woman had struck her hard for each failure . Actually , she 'd also occasionally hit her if she prepared a dish perfectly , saying she did n't want her to become conceited . Laren said now , " You and I have seen so much , Cleve , lived through so much . I do n't know why a bruise on Sarla 's face would make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly as angry as that horrible scar on your face . If I could I would kill both men who caused each of you the pain . " She paused a moment , then said , " I am afraid of Erik . " " I know . It is a pity that your body is n't as strong as your spirit . Would you truly kill the man who scarred me , Laren ? " " Aye , I would enjoy causing him great pain . " " It was a woman . "  | She could only stare at him , then she shook her head . " I do n't know why I am so surprised . I have seen equal cruelty from both men and women . Why did she do it ? " " I would n't bed her . " She just shook her head at him . " Did it matter so much to you ? " " Aye , " he said shortly , " it mattered greatly to me . " She saw that he would say no more and held her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like to keep the darkness of the past close and quiet . " Do you hunt with Merrik today ? " He shook his head . " Nay , I am here only to eat some of your porridge , then I will work in the fields . Harvest is not long in coming now and there is need for every hand . Even Merrik will be in the barley fields soon . " And Erik ? " Cleve shrugged as he spooned porridge into a wooden howl from the iron pot hanging from its chain over the fire pit . " I last saw him taking a woman into the bathing hut with him . I doubt washing himself is all that is on his mind . I believe her name is Megot . She is short and too fat fir my tastes , but her hair is as rich a gold as the barley in the field . " " She 's very beautiful . I have eighteen silver pieces . " He poured a bit of honey over the porridge . " That is a lot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any . " " You do n't understand , Cleve . When I have enough , I will purchase all of us from Merrik and we will go home . " " Home ? " " Aye , my home . " He just looked at her , then shook his head . " How LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 147  | would we get there ? Where is your home ? Have you people who would take us in ? " She kneaded more quickly . " I do n't know . First I must have enough silver . Then I will worry about what comes next . " " You will gain even more silver tonight . I fancy that Erik will call for you to speak . He punished only himself last night . I , like all the others , want to know what will happen to Grunlige the Dane . " " Actually , I do n't know myself much of the time until the words just pop out of my mouth . " He gazed at her in some astonishment . " You speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and sometimes he does things I never plan . " Cleve thoughtfully spooned the porridge into his mouth . " I begin to think of him as a real man when you speak of him . To realize that he is naught more than a figment of your mind depresses me . " " Do n't tell the others , all right ? " " Nay , " he said , grinning at her , " I sha n't . " " Most of the time he is very real to me as well . " She worked in silence now , and Cleve stood there eating . She chanced to look up . He was staring at Sarla . There was such tenderness in his eyes , she wanted to weep . " Oh no , " she said . He turned and smiled down at her . " Nay , Laren . I am no fool . Do you know that she does n't seem to mind the ugliness of my face ? Sometimes when she smiles at me I do n't even think she sees the scar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And a liking for me , not that it matters . It is a great shame . She is wedded to that foul bully and I , well , I am not worthy to dry her tears . "  | She looked at him and saw his pain and reminded herself yet again that life held little enough joy , and that any joy at all that came should be savored to the fullest .  | LATE THAT AFTERNOON , there was a great commotion outside the longhouse . Men were shouting , but it was n't in fear or the kind of shouted orders before an attack . She went outside to see that visitors had come to Mal-verne . " It is the Thoragassons , " Sarla said at her elbow . " They live to the north in the Bergson Valley , some three days ' journey from here . " She paused a moment , then added , " Before Merrik 's father died , he negotiated a marriage contract with Olaf Thoragasson between his eldest daughter , Letta , and Merrik . I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will do so . Perhaps he wishes it , I do not know . " " Oh , " Laren said . Sarla gave her a quick look . She looked off into the distance , at the vivid green of the thick fir trees that covered the mountains on the opposite side of the fjord . " I know Merrik took you to his chamber last night , as well as the night before . All know of it , Erik as well . " " Aye , Merrik made no secret of his intent . " " Erik was furious . He ordered me to remain in the outer hall . He took both Caylis and Megot into his sleeping chamber with him . " " He does n't deserve you , Sarla. "  | Sarla shrugged . " He is a man and now he is the lord of Malverne . Whatever he wishes he can have . Me included . Other women included as well . I am glad he left me alone . " She paused a moment , then added , a touch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you and I do not understand why I do so . Many of the women here are my friends , they welcomed me here two years ago when I arrived at Malverne as Erik 's wife , and yet I say nothing to them about , well , I speak of nothing save household matters . It was the same with Tora , Merrik 's mother , and she was very kind to me . " " I will not betray your trust . I was not raised to do that . " " I never thought that you would . Somehow , I sense it . Perhaps you will confide in me . I doubt I can help you , but perhaps it would be possible . Did Merrik hurt you ? " " No . " " Ah , you are not like me . No , do n't apologize to me , Laren , it does n't matter . You are used to being alone and having no one save a child to share your confidences . Merrik is a man to trust . Perhaps you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that would never gain me anything . He does n't want me , Sarla , I will tell you that . He does want to protect me from Erik , and he has the last two nights , as I think he will continue to do . He does this because he loves Taby , and he feels he would n't be keeping faith with the child if he allowed me to be raped . He does n't think of me as a woman , which is fine with me . As for trust , who can say ? He is a man and a Viking and I have always known that Vikings seek profit , and that they only hold faith and honor amongst themselves , not with outsiders or slaves . Aye , I know this very well . " " But Taby ? " LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 151  | " He loves the child . But how long will that last ? " " I do not know him that well . But you are fond of him . You must sense something worthy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laren . Do you know that when you tell of Grunlige the Dane , you look nearly always at Merrik ? Ah , say what you will , Laren , deny it until your tongue dries out with all your denials , but I will keep my own opinion . " " Your opinion is wrong , Sarla . " " We will see . Ah , I must greet the Thoragassons . " The Thoragassons had brought some dozen men and four women . They were a handsome family , Laren thought , but then again most of the Norsemen she 'd ever seen and known were well made and pleasing to the eye , both here and at home . As for Letta , Laren thought she looked like a spoiled child . Oh , she was pretty enough , seventeen years old , with thick blond braids coiled atop her head , a full mouth that looked as if it pouted a lot , and breasts that were surely too large for such a small girl . Laren was only a year her senior , yet she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cynical and bone-weary . She could scarce remember now the times when she was happy and a child and there was nothing more than playing and riding her mare , Selje , to concern her . Laren saw Erik eye those big breasts and quickly looked over at Merrik . He , too , was looking at the girl , but he was n't looking at her breasts . He merely looked harassed . No pleasure at seeing his father 's choice of a bride , just harassed . When the Thoragassons learned of the deaths , there was consternation , and it was n't due entirely to an overabundance of sorrow at Harald 's and Tora 's passing . No , it was because there were no negotiated ties  | now to hold Merrik Haraldsson to their family . Still , the elder Thoragasson , a bluff , hearty man with white threaded through his blond hair , slapped Merrik on his back , inquired , discreet as a wild bull , as to his current wealth after his summer trading , and pointed out with a sly wink the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's even more finely endowed than she was during the winter solstice when last you saw her , " he said . " Aye , more than a handful she would give a man . " Merrik agreed that this was true . Olaf Thoragasson frowned . " I wonder why her mother is n't so , well , bountiful . " Merrik wisely kept his mouth shut . " You have reached your twenty-fifth year , Merrik , " Thoragasson said , his voice fraught with meaning . Merrik only smiled . " I am not ready to lose my teeth or my virility just yet . " " Ah , but to have children relieves a man 's mind , for there are his progeny to succeed him if he falls in battle of if struck by illness . Aye , a wife and children make a man 's life fuller and richer . " Merrik agreed that this was probably so . " A man need n't just cleave to a wife , " Olaf said , lowering his voice , giving Merrik an understanding leer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoys all of them . A man may do whatever he wishes if he has the silver for it . " " My father was always loyal and faithful to my mother . " " He was , but he did n't have to be . Heed me , Merrik , your father very much wanted to unite our families . He himself looked upon my little Letta and chose her for you . Surely you admired your father , surely you trusted his judgment . " " In most cases , certainly , " Merrik said . LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 153  | " Is not my little Letta a gem ? " Thoragasson said , his voice sharp now , pressing , for he scented that things were n't going as he wished . " Surely a gem of more value than to be wasted upon a younger son who has no land . " " Aye , but my Letta is a Viking woman . She would follow her husband wherever he wished to settle . Besides , there is more than enough land for you near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support you and a family . " Merrik hated the Bergson Valley . It rained too much ; fog shrouded the fjord most days . He did n't like the Thoragasson men . He looked over at Letta , who was seated next to Ileria , the old woman who had worked the loom for all his life . The soft gray tunic he was wearing she had woven for him during the spring from the finest wool . It was to be his lucky tunic for when he traded with the savages , she 'd told him . Letta was helping Ileria , loading a shuttle with thread from a distaff . She looked competent doing it . " Even now , she seeks more knowledge to make your life comfortable , " Thoragasson said near to Merrik 's ear . " She is always learning , always asking her elders what is right , what is good . She is a fine girl . She would be submissive to your wishes . " Merrik doubted that , but said nothing . He even managed to smile . Thoragasson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erik . It was n't until after a quickly prepared feast that night that he sat back , patted his belly , and looked toward Deglin . " Well , Deglin , what say you ? Have you a special tale for me this night ? " Erik said in a loud voice that brought him everyone 's attention , " Nay , it is the girl here who is now our skald . " There was immoderate laughter from Thoragasson ,  | his family , and his men . " Who ? " one of the men shouted . " That thin little wisp of a beggar that I could crush with one hearty breath ? " " Your breath could fell an oak tree , " one of his friends shouted . There was good-natured banter , until one of Erik 's men insulted one of Thoragasson 's men with too much eagerness , and a fight broke out . It ended quickly , but one man 's arm was broken and another 's nose was bleeding profusely . There seemed to be blood everywhere , not just from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the havoc wrought in such a short time . Was it always so with men ? Were they only content when they were eating , rutting women , or breaking each other 's bodies ? They loved to yell and curse and strike each other . Then , suddenly , Erik rose from the floor , where he 'd been pummeling one of his own men , reached for Megot and fondled her breasts in front of everyone . He kissed her hard , then smacked her bottom and told her to fetch him more beer . Laren watched Sarla oversee the bandaging , watched another woman , Bartha , tend to the bleeding nose . She watched Megot give Erik his beer . She watched him fondle her buttocks and smile at Thoragasson as he did it . She waited , silent , knowing that Erik would say something soon . She looked at Merrik , who had himself flattened several men , and had bruised knuckles . At least there was no blood on him . He was grinning hugely and had just taken Taby from Cleve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The child shrieked and laughed . He kissed him and held him close . She saw Thoragasson staring at him , and she knew he wondered if Taby was Merrik 's child . He might as well be his child , she thought , for the bond between LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 155  | them was strengthening each day . She had to get Taby away from here soon , or losing Merrik would break the child 's heart . No , no , she told herself , children forgot quickly , they adapted easily as situations changed . Laren looked away from him to the Thoragassons , and suddenly she saw them with new eyes . Now she saw them as a source of more silver pieces . She saw them as saviors . If they but knew it surely they would find it funny . When Erik called for quiet and told her to begin , she rose , smiled at everyone , and began once again at the beginning . In order not to bore the Malverne people , she embellished the tale , giving more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said in a lower voice , infusing new drama , new mystery into her words , " Selina remained on her knees staring after her husband . As for Parma , as soon as Grunlige had disappeared over a rise , he rose and laughed , so proud of himself and his cleverness that he did a little dance . He took a step toward Selina , then stopped . Nay , ' he said , I will only take you when Grunlige is dead and I have seen his body and spat upon it . I will cut off your witch 's head so all your evil will die with you . ' He laughed again and left her there , her body racked with her sobs . " Grunlige felt filled with power and strength . Odin had saved him once and when he again proved his valor , Odin would reward him again , give him more power than before , and then he would slay all his enemies . He strode back to his farmstead and called his men together . They marveled at their lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when he told them that they were voyaging to Iceland to trap furs for trade at Hedeby , they looked furtively at each other , fear scoring their faces . It was still winter ; it would be  | dangerous , just as dangerous as it had been the first time . " But Grunlige was their master and they put their faith in him and in none other . Had he not come back to them , whole and strong ? Aye , he was near to Odin , all knew it , and all trusted him completely . They left Norway and voyaged into the North Sea , past the Shetland Islands and the Faeroes , then straight toward the settlement of Thingvellir in Iceland . " Merrik stared at her . How did she know all these things ? All these places ? " All went well , almost miraculously well . Their voyage took only two weeks , the wind pushing them quickly westward , more quickly than any would have imagined possible . It was as if an unseen force were shoving them toward their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gods had blessed this trip , and when they arrived at Thingvellir , they trapped more furs than they ever had before . The hold of the longboat was filled to overflowing . All were joyous . All would have died for Grunlige . " ' They left Iceland and all cheered Grunlige . As before , the wind blew up at their backs and shoved them swiftly eastward . Suddenly , without warning , a terrible storm blew up . The weather was so cold even the warmest furs scarcely sufficed . Just as suddenly , not one day west of the Faeroes , a huge ice field moved down from the north and directly into their path . They were trapped behind it . They could n't move forward . The men cried out that they must return to Iceland and they must row quickly for ice floes were breaking off the huge ice field and beginning to surround the longboat . They would soon be snared in the middle and they would die from the cold , far from home , forsaken by the gods . Grunlige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spread his arms , shouting to the heavens , Odin , I am here . Test me ! ' " Laren paused a moment , then said quickly , " Nay , this night you will all learn what happened to Grunlige the Dane , but first I must have mead to soothe my throat . " Erik grunted , subsiding in his chair . It was Letta , seeing that this girl had gained everyone 's attention , including Merrik 's , who said in a loud voice , " I am tired of this endless chatter . It is silly . You , my lord Merrik , never would you be so stupid as to venture out again onto an ice floe , as did this boastful Dane . I would that Deglin finish this tale , for it needs a conclusion worthy of a great man 's skills . " There was utter silence . Laren stared at the girl , wishing she could slap her , the insufferable little twit with her big breasts , but she said nothing . It was n't her decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Erik said , " She will finish the tale , Letta Thoragasson . Continue , Laren . " In that instant she smiled at Erik , so relieved that she would have smiled at a stone had it had given her permission . He stared back at her , his eyes gleaming , and she knew that smile had been a mistake . She said quickly , looking directly at Merrik , " Test me ! ' Grunlige cried to the heavens , his arms outstretched . Aye , Odin All-Father , test me ! ' " Then he leapt from the longboat to the nearest ice floe . He was smiling , then laughing . He shouted back to his men , Be not afraid , for I am not the fool I was before ! Aye , I was vainglorious and thought not of myself as a man who could be hurt and could die . Trust me and know that Odin is testing my brain this time ,  | and not my strength . Throw me the thickest of the otter furs ! ' " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grinned at her . " Grunlige shredded the ice floe , flinging the shards of ice wildly into the waters until , once again , nothing remained but slivers that would n't hurt a fish . He climbed back over into the longboat . He said , This is why I wanted so many furs trapped . I knew I would need them . I have demolished at least thirty of our stoutest furs in this battle . Aye , listen now closely , for I must speak softly . I did n't tell Odin what I planned , for I guessed it was my wits he doubted and wanted to test . ' " Ile then stared toward the sky . Have I gained your favor again , Odin ? ' " There was a huge bolt of lightning that struck the center of the huge ice field that floated just off to the east . The ice field exploded , flinging shards of ice high into the air , causing the waves to swell and rock the longboat from side to side . The men fell to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they returned to Norway , Grunlige saw his wife and hurried to her . He held out his hands to her and said , I am not the fool you believed me to be . I am home and I am a man with new humility . ' " There was much rejoicing , until suddenly silence fell and all looked toward the open doorway of the longhouse . There stood Parma , and he was smiling . Do you come back with blackened claws again , Grunlige ? ' he yelled into the chamber . Come here and I will slay you this time and I will cut out your guts and throw them to the gulls that fly close to the shore . ' " It was Selina who answered , saying , Parma , you have heard aright . Grunlige is no more . This is his spirit , come to bid us all farewell . Come here and you LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 159  | will see what you have wrought with your guile and your cunning . ' " Parma swaggered through the chamber until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , whole and strong and hard . He stared into Grunlige 's face . He saw the truth and knew himself doomed . He paled and turned to run . " Suddenly , a sword appeared in Grunlige 's hand , a mighty sword of steel so bright and shiny that all would swear later that it was Odin 's visage all could see in its reflection . Grunlige raised the sword slowly , in both his hands , high over his head . He smiled even as he lowered it , slowly , so very slowly , cleaving Parma 's head into two halves , continuing downward until Parma was cut into two equal parts , each teetering , each searching for the other , for life that could no longer be . The parts fell to the earth . Oddly , no blood spurted from the severed body , no blood at all . " All looked down , but there was naught but the two halves and they were empty . There was nothing at all inside the halves . The men pulled back in fear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred . Grunlige cried , I have smote the demon sent to test me , to strangle me with his fear . ' He turned to his wife and said , He was Parma before he came into this chamber , but then Odin removed him and threw him into a coward 's oblivion . He put the demon of air in his place . It is over now . There is no more . ' " There followed abundant good fortune for Grunlige the Dane and his children and his children 's children . Each generation knew of his valor and his wisdom , and the tale was repeated so often that after many years it passed into legend and then into myth . But it is said that his progeny still live here in Norway  --  where , no one is certain . But you will believe it is a fact , if , on a  | stormy night , you listen very carefully , then you will hear the thunder boom out his name and know that Odin All-Father never forgot his warrior who was , true to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all gods . " Laren stopped . She stood silent , her head down . She did n't look up when the cheering began nor did she move when the silver coins struck the ground at her feet . A silver piece hit her toe and she felt nearly giddy with the joy of it . She kept her head down . She did n't want any of them to see the sheer hope in her expression , and she knew that if anyone saw it and understood it , it would be Merrik . Not many minutes later Merrik took her with him to his sleeping chamber . He did it in full sight of the Thoragassons and the girl Letta . He left Taby with Cleve , telling him to put him to bed with all the other children when he had tired of listening to the child chatter on and on about Grunlige and how very wise he was . As if he were a real man who really lived , Merrik thought , and then realized that he himself had considered Grunlige to be as real as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laren had been told of him , perhaps .. . When he lay beside Laren , unmoving , he said , " You did well . " She thanked him , then drew a deep breath . " I would ask you something , Merrik . " " Aye ? " " How much did you pay for Taby at the slave mar-ket ? " He stiffened . She believed him stupid , curse her , believed him so stupid that he would n't remember all the silver pieces she 'd been given since she 'd begun her storytelling . He wondered how many pieces she 'd col-  | lected now . There had been at least twenty pieces at her feet after she 'd finished her tale this evening , twenty pieces of silver and two heavy silver armlets , one from Olaf Thoragasson himself . " I paid fifty pieces of silver for him . " He heard her cry of distress , but he did nothing , merely asked , " Why do you care ? I would pay even more for Taby . He is worth a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed words , for the moment , were beyond her . She saw her dreams sinking swiftly into the raging current of the North Sea . Merrik chuckled . " Taby told me again this afternoon that he was a prince . He stuck his chin in the air and all but strutted when he said it . " Utter silence . That was odd , he thought . Surely she should at least laugh or say something about Taby 's imagination . " He told me he would allow me to continue taking care of him . Then he ruined his princely image by jumping at me and winding his arms around my neck . I nearly dropped him , for I was sharpening a scythe we will be using soon in the barley field . " He heard her breathing , sharp and shallow . He said easily , " The meal you prepared was beyond anything our people have ever eaten . I imagine that Thoragasson , when he discovers who added girth to his belly this evening , will want to buy you . Just imagine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skald . " He paused a moment , then added , " Your value rises with each passing day . " " And I am your concubine . " " Aye , that too . I doubt there is much envy there , for you are still too skinny . " " You allowed all the Thoragassons to see you take me into this sleeping chamber with you . If you are be-  | trothed to Letta , why would you wish to hurt her by doing it ? " " I believe a woman should know that a man will always do as he wishes . If I wed with her , she wo n't be surprised when I take other women to my bed . " " You are like Erik , then . " " Oh no , " he said , then wished he 'd kept his mouth shut . " What is wrong with my brother ? Other than his wanting to bed you ? " " He strikes Sarla . " " Nay , " Merrik said slowly , turning now toward her , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to having what he wants , but to strike Sarla is absurd . He is a brave man and he is my brother . You are making that up because you dislike him so very much , because you fear him . " " Look at her face . " " You are wrong . " " She said that he hits her whenever she displeases him . He hit her three nights ago when you kept me from him . I t was his disappointment , she thought . " Merrik struggled with her words , with the image her words provoked in his mind . Erik strike gentle Sarla ? Laren sighed . " If she proves barren , I doubt not he will kill her , that or simply send her back to her family . How long does a man give a woman to bear him children ? Three years ? Perhaps four ? " " No , he would not do that . Cease your tales , Laren , for I will give you no silver pieces for your stories . If you wish to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you come from . " " Perhaps once I am free of you , Cleve and Taby with me , I will send a messenger back to you , for then I would have nothing more to fear from you . " That nearly sent him over the edge . " Your damned  | arrogance and pride ! You gall me , woman . You fear me ? For what reason ? Have I ever hurt you ? Damn you , I did not take you when you offered yourself to me , and you were more than willing , were you not ? No , I did n't take you because ? " He seemed to realize that what he intended to say would n't result in the conclusion he sought . He shut his mouth . She said flatly , " You did n't take me because you find me ugly . " " That is not true . " " The other reason you did n't take me is because of Taby . You love a child who is n't even of your blood . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ireland , stolen by Viking marauders just like you and your kind . I will accept that you care for him even though I will never understand the depths of your feelings for him . What did you do , Merrik , promise him you would protect me as well as him ? Did you swear to him you would n't ravish me ? " " You should select another word . Ravish does n't apply to us . " She sucked in her breath , fleeting memories of those incredible feelings whirling about the edges of her mind . " Even if I threw myself upon you naked , you would do nothing . You would cast me aside . " Merrik frowned into the darkness . He said slowly , carefully selecting his words , " You sound as if you want me to take you , make you my concubine . " Ah , she thought , here was the rub , here was the truth , unmasked , but she would n't admit it to him . She merely laughed , saying , " Perhaps I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I would know what it is all about . Then it would be enough . Then I could forget about it . But know this , Merrik , I would never want you  | for anything more than just a brief diversion , an amusement for just a single night that might please me as much as a good story . " He had saved her life , damn her . He had cared for her , protected her from his brother . He wanted to strangle her . He lurched toward her and came down on top of her . His hands closed about her neck , but did n't tighten . " You damnable witch , " he said , then found her mouth in the darkness and kissed her hard , not caring if he hurt her . Let it be an amusement for him , and let her cry in pain at such a diversion . His rage increased when she did n't move , just lay there , suffering his attack . He felt the softness of her belly , the giving weight of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me. "  | SHE DID N'T FIGHT him , oh no , fighting him was far from her mind . She lurched up against him , grabbed his face between her hands and brought him down to her . She found his mouth after kissing his chin , his nose , his cheek , and she kissed him hard , her lips parted this time , and he was so surprised , so utterly dumbfounded by her actions , that he froze over her , not opening his mouth , not doing anything at all , save trying to control the heaving breaths that bespoke his lust . He jerked away from her , his heart beating so fast he wondered if he would survive it . He remained on top of her , but he was balancing himself on his elbows above her to keep distance between him and that wonderful mouth of hers . " Why did you do that , damn you ? You were lying there as if you were dead , or suffering me until I would get done with you . And then you attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would only come back down to me . It is n't fair . You can force me since you are the stronger , but I can not force you to do what it is I want . " Then she smiled up at him , hit the sides of both her hands hard against the crooks of his elbows and he fell flat on top of her , driving the breath from her . She grabbed his ears and held him there , kissing his throat ,  | his shoulders . Merrik laughed , he could n't help himself . He reared up again , still laughing . " You forgot that I am very smart , " she said . " I wo n't forget that in the future . Now , answer me . Why did you do that ? " She did n't say anything , just stared up at him in the dim light . He wanted to demand that she answer him , but that look of hers and the words she 'd spoken flowed over him like balm , soothing and so soft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And her laughter , by all the gods , her laughter was wonderful . And she 'd even knocked him down on her , she wanted to kiss him so very much , and he said , surprising himself even as the words came out of his mouth , " You wo n't have to fell me again . I will allow you to do as you please with me . " " Come back to me . " She knew exactly what she was asking . She 'd thought about it for a very long time , truth be told , probably since he 'd cared for her on board his longboat , at least thought about him as a man and not an enemy who would hurt her . No , she 'd thought of him as a man , so very different from her , a man who was kind to her , whose hands were gentle , a man who would give her immense pleasure . Her future had changed irrevocably that long-ago night when she and Taby had been taken , and the future that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shrouded in uncertainty , and in fear . She had become a realist and no longer believed like a credulous fool that there could exist a future that would be sweet and good . She had become a Christian because her uncle had demanded it of her , demanded it of all of them , but she never called on the Christian God to save her , to show her which path to take , which decision to make . She knew she owed it to Taby to try to get back LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 167  | home , to learn who had betrayed them , to restore to him what he 'd lost and to herself what she 'd lost as well . But that was the future , and she was here , and she was n't at all certain that she even wanted to regain what she herself had lost , for there was Merrik now , and she wanted him . She wanted something for herself now , and if Merrik was only willing she could have it . For just this one night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said again , her voice harsh with her growing excitement , " come back to me , Merrik . " He did , dipping his head down . Her hands again closed about his face , and her fingertips traced his brows , his nose , his jaw . He felt her warm breath fan upward as her breathing hitched . She wanted him . She truly wanted him . He felt at that moment as if Grunlige the Dane were naught but a gnat of a man in comparison to him . " Come to me , " she said again , and this time when he touched her , he opened his mouth just a bit and let her learn the feel and texture of him . When his tongue touched hers , she quivered , but then again , so did he , so he could n't be certain who quivered first or the most , nor did he care . " Open your lips wider , " he said and felt the heat of her when she did . " Laren . " He said her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded to him fully and with no fear at all . She was eager for him and she was a virgin . That stopped him , and he reared back just a bit . " Listen to me a moment before I forget who I am and what I am and what you are . " Her eyes looked soft as his mother 's butter in the dim light . She looked eager for him and ever so willing . She wanted him and she 'd told him she wanted him . He forced himself to look away from her then forced himself to say the hardest thing  | he 'd ever had to do . " Do you want to be my whore ? " He 'd purposely chosen the crudest word he could , to shock her , to make her draw back from him , to make her think , by all the gods , surely she could n't want this , surely . She had such pride , such arrogance , surely she would n't want to give herself to a man who was n't her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhineland or cobbler 's daughter from a village along the Seine in France , or perhaps even a local ov-erlord 's daughter from the dull , hot plains of Cordoba , Spain , but she deserved more than he could give her , deserved more than to be a vessel for his lust . All that arrogance and pride sounded in her voice as she said , " No , I will never be any man 's whore . I want you only for this night . I want you to teach me what I should know . I want to experience these feelings once in my life , ' twill suffice me . Actually , I am not even certain these feelings really exist . Perhaps they do but only to a certain point , just enough so that a woman would do anything for the man who makes her feel this way , and then the feelings stop and the man does n't . But it does n't matter . I want to know and I want you to be the one to teach me . " Now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have told her then that he could have forced her the moment he 'd gotten her from Thrasco 's house , that there was naught she could do about anything . She was in his power and she always had been . Instead , he said , " What if you want to have me again after this instruction I give you ? " She was shaking her head even as she said , " Even if it is possible that I might , I have more important things to consider in my life . No , just for tonight . I want you just this once , just so I may know why I feel this way about you , why you make me breathe more quickly LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 169  | when you 're near , and when you touch me , why I want to fling myself against you and kiss you and stroke you with my fingers and never stop . " He wanted to strangle her and he wanted to make her take those words back , but not all of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . He thought about kissing her and never stopping , and it did n't seem such a bad idea . He decided in that instant he would give her such pleasure that she would forget those silly words of hers  --  after all , what could be more important than he  --  forget everything but him and how he would always make her feel . Always . Oh no , not that . That could n't be . He tried to calm himself . He was n't forcing her . Truth be told , he was succumbing to her . He almost laughed at himself for his justifications . A randy man would force himself to believe anything in order to get himself inside the woman . She lurched up again and now she was nibbling at his earlobe , her hands in his hair , tugging , kissing his chin , searching for his mouth , now kissing him , her tongue between his lips , probing , but not too deeply for it was still too new to her and she was n't certain what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I love your mouth , Merrik . I 've never thought of a man 's mouth like this , but with you , all I want to do is kiss you and touch your face . " And then she was kissing him again , her fingertips feathering his cheeks , his chin , smoothing his dark blond brows , kissing him once more after that and yet again until he was drowning in her , the feel of her , the heat of her , the taste of her . He wanted her more than he 'd ever wanted another woman , except perhaps for Gunnvor when he 'd been twelve years old and she 'd been a magnificent fourteen  | and she 'd let him kiss her and fondle her and caress her and she 'd taken his rod in her hands and stroked him until he 'd spilled his seed not once but twice , and he would have killed every dragon in the world for her on that day . But this was different , he was a man now , and Gunnvor was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it in that moment , utterly mad , his judgment shattered , his reason flown to the four winds . Then he saw himself in his madness , saw her beyond the softness and yielding she was offering him . He saw the situation , and he saw Taby  --  all of it in one sharp moment  --  and he knew he would be beyond mad to take her . He drew a shuddering breath , even as her mouth kissed his , her tongue lightly touched his , making him shudder and heave with the pleasure of it . But he wanted her , very badly . Just this once , aye , then he 'd be free of her and her girl 's idealized lust for him and she would be free of him as well . That was what she had said . Aye , he 'd be free . He would n't have her there in his mind , in his thoughts . His worry for her , his fear for her , would only be as Taby 's sister , nothing else . His eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed her hard and deep , his tongue going into her mouth with a man 's lust , and no gentleness . He felt her stiffen instantly at the assault , and he gentled immediately , furious with himself . He undressed her quickly , without care of her clothing , and when his clothes were off as well , when he was at last kissing her breasts , feeling them with his hands , holding them in his palms , trying desperately not to lose himself in their feel , their taste , he was forced to close his eyes at the joy she brought him , not just her breasts , but how her hands were on his chest , his arms , around his back ,  | drawing him to her , moaning softly , not at all afraid of him . And kissing him . Even now her lips were nipping his shoulders , then licking where she 'd nipped his flesh . His hand went down to her flat belly , feeling her thinness , her still prominent pelvic bones , but not caring , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His hand went lower until he was touching her woman 's flesh lightly with his fingertips , and to his immense delight , she shuddered . She wanted him , he knew it , and she trusted him , at least in this , the giving of her body to him . His hand trembled . He looked at her soft flesh , knew he wanted to taste her , but also realized in that moment that it would probably shock her , and the last thing he wanted to do now was make her retreat from him . He could n't have borne that . He closed his eyes , refusing to look at that thin body that was quivering for him , just for him . His mouth closed over her nipple and she lurched up , giving him more of herself , and her hands were wild on his back , his shoulders , his buttocks . She was encouraging him , not really knowing how to , and her ignorance was more exciting than any woman of more experience he 'd ever enjoyed . His mouth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care if she was shocked , or frightened , he had to taste her , explore her , feel all of her with his fingers , with his mouth . He pulled her legs wide apart , settling himself between them . He did n't want to look at her , but he had to , drawing her apart with his fingers , and then he caressed her with his fingers , his mouth . She was stiff and still . Then , suddenly , she screamed with the power of it . Quickly , he slammed his hand over her mouth , still fondling her as he did so , and she was twisting her  | head , nearly beside herself now , and he knew he could n't wait another instant , another minute , for he would spill his seed on her belly , and by all the gods , he wanted to be deep inside her , have her holding him within her when he reached his release . He shoved hard into her . He felt the tearing pain , for it was difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosening and dampening , but it was n't enough , and he 'd known she was n't completely ready for him , but he did n't stop , just kept pushing harder and harder still , until finally , with a deep groan , he burst through her maidenhead . He lowered his mouth over her just in time to catch her cry of pain , for he knew that if Erik heard her cry of pain he would know it had all been a pretense , at least until this night , until this moment . Merrik filled her with himself , touching her womb , pausing just a moment , because the power of it was making him shake and moan . He wanted to pull back , to caress her again with his mouth , but he knew he could n't . He moaned , tensing , lurching more deeply into her . He pulled back , then drove forward , then once again . It took no more than that , just one final time and he felt his seed hot against her womb . His heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to die with the impact of the release he 'd just had . He thought to pull out of her , for he knew he was still causing her pain , but her arms closed tightly around his back and she held him tightly against her . He pulled her onto her side , facing him , still inside her , though not so deep now , but it did n't matter , he could feel the beating of her heart , the heat of her . He kissed her slack mouth , stroked her eyebrows , and smoothed her hair from her forehead . " I 'm sorry for your pain , " he said against her mouth . " It was your maidenhead . I had to get through it . " LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 173  | " You did , " she said . " You did . " He 'd not given her much pleasure , he thought , but there 'd been some , before he 'd come so urgently and deeply into her , and lost his reason . " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find the pleasure in our coupling that I did , and I am sorry for it . If there is to be no more between us after this night , then I must take you again , after you 've rested , and show you what it is like between a man and a woman . " She said nothing . She was held tightly against him , and he was n't inside her now , but he was so close , the scent of his warm flesh against her mouth , and she said , " I would like that except I hurt very badly , Merrik . And I 'm bleeding . Will it all stop soon ? " He said nothing , merely pulled away from her , rose from the bed , and left the chamber , uncaring that he was naked . It did n't matter in any case , for only a soft haze of smoke lit the outer room and no one was awake . He fetched an oil lamp and brought it back into the sleeping chamber . He cursed as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Hold still . I will see how badly I hurt you . " He looked up into her face then and saw not only her pain there , but confusion as well . Her blue-gray eyes looking nearly black in the light . There was a light sheen of sweat on her forehead . He said more sharply than he liked , " Do n't look so lost . You will be all right , mating does n't kill a woman , Laren , and it certainly wo n't hurt you the next time . " " This is something I wanted so very much , a mystery I wanted more than anything to solve with you  --  aye , and I solved it  --  but the solution to it is not what I expected . I know all this bleeding does n't mean I will die , for you would n't slake your passion if you knew it could  | kill me . But it does hurt a lot more than I would like , and that is a surprise and a disappointment . " That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The blood was trickling down her thighs , the flow slowed now , but she could n't know that , and it was pooling on the blanket beneath her . He looked down at himself for just an instant , and saw her blood there , her blood and his seed . He drew a deep breath , and said , " It is n't bad . Now , hold still . " She felt the wet of a soft cloth against her , cleaning her . Then he pressed the cloth firmly against her . She looked away from him , from the intent look on his face as he tended to her . She had no idea what he was thinking , what he was feeling . She said , " I felt such strange things when you looked at me , when you touched me . When you kissed me , when I felt your tongue in my mouth , and on my body , I felt as if a small part of the world would be mine and everything would be well and good . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He flattened his palm on her belly , holding her still . " Do n't move , " he said , and wrapped the wet cloth more securely around his finger and eased it again into her to see if he 'd rent her . " No , keep still , do n't tighten your body so . Try to let yourself ease . I 'll be through soon . " She was silent , stiff , and he knew he was hurting her , but he tried , by all the gods , he tried to be gentle . He wished his damned finger were smaller , but it was n't . He eased his finger out of her , relieved that the flow of blood was nearly stopped , then rinsed out the cloth . He sat beside her on the bed , folded the cloth , then pressed it against her and held it there . He looked up at her face . She was pale , her eyes swollen from crying , her hair tangled about her face . LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 175  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . And he 'd done his best , surely he had , but still , he 'd come into her before he 'd brought her to a woman 's pleasure . He remembered her scream when he 'd closed his mouth over her . By all the gods , to make a woman feel like this . He shuddered with the power that memory brought him . He said , " You will be all right . I do not think I would come inside you again this night . But again , Laren , perhaps tomorrow or the next day when you 're healed again . " She opened her eyes , and looked at him , never once letting her eyes fall below his face . He said again , " I 'm sorry . " " Why would you be sorry ? I was the one who demanded that you do those things to me . You have been naught but honorable and kind to me . You did nothing that any other man does not do . It is my fault . I have nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly and bony and I know it and I do n't wish to have you staring at me . Could you cover me , Merrik ? " He covered her and his hand as well , for he still kept the cloth pressed firmly against her . " You 're not ugly , " he said . " Stop saying that you are . " She smiled at him . She raised her hand to touch his face , then dropped it . He wished she had touched him , was still touching him . " There , " he said , looking away , " the bleeding has stopped . Do you still hurt ? " She nodded , not looking at him . " You will be fine tomorrow , " he said and rose . He stretched , then tossed the blood-dampened cloth into the soapstone bowl of water . When he came into the bed again , he said nothing more , merely drew her to him , and pressed her face down upon his shoulder . " No , " he said , " do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do too , " she said , unable at that moment not to speak the truth . His arm tightened around her back , then immediately loosened and she knew he was thinking about her back and the still tender welts . She wanted to tell him that she would rather have him hold her tightly , regardless of any pain , but she did n't . She burrowed her face against his chest , drawing in the scent of him , feeling his hair against her cheek , her nose , wanting to taste him . She knew in that moment that her life had changed irrevocably . To have him inside her body , to have him hold her against him , had changed everything . What she 'd been destined for meant nothing now . Only he was important now . And Taby . What of her little brother ? She had to try to set things aright for him . She closed her eyes , willing blankness to come but she could n't close out the enormity of what lay just beyond the sleeping chamber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair on his chest . Forty silver pieces and two silver armlets . By all the gods , she 'd much rather know that she could trust him . With her . With Taby . The night was chill , the stars brilliant overhead . There was a half moon . Laren slowly turned back to the longhouse . She 'd felt a very strong urge to simply walk through those palisade gates and keep walking , forever , for there were no solutions for her here , none . She winced , remembering how Erik had stopped her early that afternoon , in plain sight of his wife and many of his men . He 'd forced her face upward , cupping her chin in his palm , his touch hard , hurting her . He 'd said , " Megot told me there was blood on the blanket in Mer-rik 's sleeping chamber . And blood on a cloth and colLORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 177  | oring the water in a bowl . So you did n't lie to me . It is your monthly flow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 'd released her , and said over his shoulder , " You 're still as skinny as a hen at winter solstice , so Merrik should tire of you soon . Then you will come to me . Then I will have you . " She shivered , not from the chill breeze blowing up from the fjord , but from his words . She was afraid of him , very afraid . And angry as well . Sarla knew what he did , and he did n't care . He was very different from Merrik . At least Merrik would never raise his hand to her or to any one of his people . She did n't doubt that he could be violent and ruthless , that he could kill swiftly with no remorse , that an enemy would know no mercy at his hands , but he would n't inflict pain on someone weaker than he , someone in his care . She walked slowly back to the longhouse . The huge doors were open and she saw all the men , women , and children inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the arguments , saw two men fighting . But she did n't see Merrik . And she looked for him , she always looked for him , not feeling right until she 'd found him . She 'd seen little of him the entire day . He 'd worked in the fields until it was nearly dark , then gone into the bathing hut with several of his men , laughing , jesting , punching each other . He 'd seemed entirely untouched to her eyes , and it hurt her . The previous night had meant nothing to him . What had she expected ? She was the one responsible for her own feelings , her own actions , not he . She had n't offered to cook the meal and Sarla had n't asked her to . She 'd sensed that something was wrong , but she 'd said nothing , merely patted Laren 's arm . With all the people here , Laren did help serve the din-  | ner and she worked hard until it was done . Then she 'd left the longhouse . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . She squared her shoulders and walked inside . No one noticed her , even Taby who was howling with laughter as Kenna taught him some wrestling tricks . Now , she helped herself to some venison , and some cabbage stewed with peas and apples . It was a strange combination , but tasty . She 'd eaten only a few bites when Erik called out , " Come here , girl , for all of us wish another tale . " Another story . She looked around at all the eager faces . The men seemed as eager as the women , and the children were already beginning to crowd around her , Taby standing beside her , holding her skirt in one of his small fists . She 'd thought of this on and off all day long . Aye , she had a story and she prayed it would show her what to do . She looked at the Thoragassons , and they , too , looked eager , all except for Letta , who looked sullen . Letta was also staring at Merrik , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on his legs , tickling him and smiling when he squirmed and giggled . There was deep , very deep anger in Letta 's eyes . Laren smiled at all of them in turn , including Letta.  | SHE 'D SURVIVED ON her wits for two long years . Aye , her wits , and great doses of sheer luck , and that luck had almost run out by the time she 'd met Merrik . She would n't fail now , she could n't , it was simply too important . Everything hung in the balance now . She thought of her forty silver pieces , her two armlets , and knew they would make no difference to anything . She motioned the children to sit around her in a circle . She wanted to speak quickly , to get it over with , but she knew it was wise to begin slowly , for it gained ev-eryone 's attention and held them whilst she built her story , like a house . " I will tell you about Rolf the Viking who lived a long time ago here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a warrior of rare mettle , as are most of the men in Norway . Rolf was young , a man in his prime , and as handsome of mien as he was powerful of body . " He had two brothers , both strong , both handsome , both ambitious . They were all in their prime , all as handsome of mien as they were powerful of body . Rolf was the eldest and he went araiding for the sheer joy of battle and he added to his wealth as the summers went by . Radnor , the second son , was a trader and he voyaged far and wide with his goods . He was wily and  | more quick-witted than an Arab in a bazaar . He became quickly as rich as Rolf . The youngest son was Ingor , a farmer . His farmstead prospered , for he had a magic way with crops and he , too , grew richer with each passing season . " Rolf came home from raiding along the mighty Seine River . He brought with him twelve slaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the three small villages having the misfortune to sit too close to the river . " One of the male slaves was a man as proud and strong as were the Viking warriors who had managed to capture him . He 'd been unlucky and the warriors knew it . He 'd been ill and still he 'd fought them until he 'd collapsed with the wounds and the illness within his body . He was dressed more finely than the others captured , and all the warriors knew that as well . But whoever he was , what his real name was , none knew and he would n't say anything . He was also a man with talent  --  in short , he was a runemaster  --  but more than that , he was a scion of a proud family that had much wealth and power in that region of France . He 'd just chanced to be in the village that fateful day because he was visiting an artisan from whom he wished to learn new methods to perfect his skill . " But now he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value when he saw it and kept him close . He made the man his runemaster and was astonished with the beautiful carvings the man accomplished along with his fashioning of magnificent writ . Visitors heard of the runemaster and visited Rolf from far and wide . Radnor , the second brother , tried to buy the slave from his brother , but Rolf refused . " Ah , but the silver the slave gained from the visitors who came to Roll 's longhouse . He carved them magnif-  | icent chair posts , intricate designs on jewelry and on jewel boxes . He became renowned . Soon , he had as much silver as he thought he needed to buy himself from Rolf and thus regain his freedom . " He offered all his silver to Rolf , but Rolf refused . He allowed the slave to keep all his silver , but he said he would n't sell him . He told the slave he admired him , he wanted him to be content in his new home , in his new land . " He did n't abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was friendship he felt toward the slave or whether he was afraid the slave would gullet him , for he was , as you know already , a valiant fighter and now he was back to his full strength . " The slave held his peace until finally he could bear it no longer . Rolf assured him that whatever he wished to tell him he would keep in confidence ; he vowed it on his honor . The slave was n't stupid , but when Rolf told him if the truth meant he might lose him , then so be it . He was to trust him . The slave was still uncertain , but he leapt at the chance of going home . So he told Rolf who he was , told him that his family was powerful and wealthy and he was the heir and he asked Rolf to stand as his friend , as he 'd just professed himself to be , and help him regain his proper station in life . " Rolf clasped the slave to him and told him to trust him , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he would most assuredly assist him to return to his home . Now , the question is , what did Rolf do ? " Laren paused , then looked at Olaf Thoragasson . " My lord , " she said , bowing toward him , " what would you have done were you Rolf ? " Olaf Thoragasson leaned forward in his chair . He looked at his men , at the group of slaves who were clustered near the doors of the longhouse . He said loudly ,  | " I would flay the flesh from the man 's back for such insolence ! It means nothing to make a vow to a slave , less than nothing , despite his claims , despite his skills . Aye , Rolf should chain the beggar and let him starve until he declares his allegiance is to Rolf and to no one else ! " He sat back in his chair and his men cheered . Some of the Malverne people cheered as well , but not all . Laren turned to Erik . " My lord , what would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smile of superiority at her wom-an 's ignorance , her lack of understanding of the way of men and of honor . He said slowly , " I would ransom the fellow from this powerful and wealthy family of his , and then I would keep him and chain him up . Olaf is right , it is just that I am not only right as well , I am also richer . " There was much laughter , Thoragasson not taking offense , guffawing loudly , praising Erik 's wit . Laren waited silently , standing motionless , outwardly serene and calm , then she turned to Merrik . " My lord Merrik , what would you have Rolf do ? " He said very slowly , his eyes never leaving her face , " Were I this Rolf , I would keep my word . It would n't matter if the man was a slave or a king . I would take the man back to his kin . I would restore him . " " You 're a fool , brother ! " Erik shouted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even make the possession pay for his freedom ! " " Aye , " Thoragasson said loudly . " Honor comes not into it , Merrik . Your word given to naught but a slave means nothing , just as I said . Had Rolf given his word to one of his brothers , then it would have been different . But to this damned slave ? Never ! Let him be a captured king , it does n't matter . " LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 183  | Laren waited until all the men and women grew silent once more , until one by one , they looked at her again . " Tell us , girl , " Thoragasson said . " What did Rolf do ? " " He went to speak to his brothers . Ragnor told him to treat the slave just as you said , Olaf Thoragasson . Ingor told him to do just as Erik said . " She paused and Thoragasson roared , " What did Rolf do ? " She looked at each man in turn , then said very quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brothers yet he was n't certain which was right or if either one of them was right . He muttered and tried to reason it out , but he could n't . Time passed and his rage at his own weakness , his own failure to decide what to do , drove him nearly mad . Finally , in a moment of enraged madness , he took down his mighty sword , said good-bye to the slave , and ran his sword through the slave 's heart . " There was a loud yell from Thoragasson , moans from . the women , laughter from Erik , and nothing from Merrik , nothing at all . He did n't move , his expression did n't change . He did nothing , merely looked at her impas-sively . Finally , when everyone quieted , Merrik said , " That is n't the end of the Viking though , is it ? What happened next ? " " Rolf came to himself once again . He regretted deeply what he 'd done . Guilt ate at him endlessly , never giving him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat , nor could he think about going araiding again . He withdrew from his brothers , blaming them for his loss of judgment . Soon he blamed them entirely for the death of his slave . " The brothers were furious with his treatment of them . They bedeviled Rolf , telling him he was more a  | fool than the slave had been to trust in his word . Aye , they mocked him : he had lied to the slave , whereas they 'd done nothing save offer their opinion , and he , Rolf , had asked for it , after all . But to kill such a valuable slave ! It was madness and Rolf had done it , thus he was mad . They would n't leave him alone . On and on it went until , finally , Rolf could no longer bear himself for he saw at last that they were in the right of it . " He 'd betrayed the slave , then he 'd smote him . He knew there was but one way to make amends . He threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest . He knew that sooner or later a wild beast would attack him and kill him . He wanted death ; he actively sought death to release him from the man he 'd become . " Laren stopped because she did n't know what happened next . Her head pounded and she was thirsty . She became suddenly aware of the raw pain between her thighs . She looked toward Merrik , for he was the cause of that pain . He was looking back at her , his expression unreadable to her . Aye , she felt the rawness between her thighs , but she knew it was the pain of his indifference to her during the entire day and evening that hurt her more . She lowered her head , waiting . The people were still silent , so silent , she fancied she could hear the thick smoke rising toward the hole in the thatch roof . They had hated her story . They would throw things at her . They would ask to have Deglin back . Then there were moans and complaints , demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shook her pounding head . " I am very tired , " she said finally . " Please , I must stop now. , , There were gold coins amongst the silver , most pressed into her hand , and a beautiful pounded brooch , given to her by one of Thoragasson 's two sons . " It beLORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 185  | longed to my mother , " he told her . She tried to give it back , but he merely pressed it into her hand and closed her fingers over it . " I wish you to have it , Laren . " She watched him walk away from her . She did n't even remember his name . He was n't more than fifteen , but he would be as big as all the damned Vikings , and fair-haired , his eyes blue as the summer skies . As for Letta Thoragasson , she stopped in front of Laren and smiled down at her . It was n't a nice smile , it was filled with malice . " Listen to me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wrist and dragged her closer . " Do n't ever think you will beat me , for you wo n't . I do n't mind that Merrik uses you . You are a slave , a whore , and that is what you are good for . He is a man with a man 's needs , and I admire him because he does n't seek to dishonor me by coming to my bed before we are wed . You are nothing more than a vessel for his lust . Take him into you now , for soon , once we are wed , he will sell you and I will not have to see your ugly face again . " She paused , then smiled more widely . " Oh aye , he will sell you for that is what I will demand for my wedding gift . Who knows ? Perhaps my father will buy you and you will spend your miserable life telling him stories . " She threw Laren 's wrist away from her . Laren stared after her . " She is right , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Letta 's words . " You are nothing more than Merrik 's whore and it will stop when he weds that little fool . Merrik believes a man should cleave to one woman once that woman is his wife . He dreams of finding a woman who is like our mother was to our father . It wo n't happen with that one . He will bed Letta for a short time , even hold faith with her for  | a while , then he will realize that she gives him too little , and he will have other women , just as I have had to do . Sarla is different from Letta , but in many ways she is the same . No , you can believe Letta in this and you can believe me . Merrik will sell you once he weds . But it wo n't matter to you , Laren , for you will be gone . " If you are nice to me , Laren , I wo n't let Merrik sell you to old Thoragasson . I 'll buy you and keep you here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to the Bergson Valley to live . " " Laren ! " Merrik was striding toward her . He nodded to his brother , then said , " Your story lacked force and passion tonight . Perhaps you are saving that passion for me . I trust so , else I will be displeased with you . Come along now , I wish to have you . " Laren heard a laugh . She turned slightly and saw that I.etta was sniggering behind her hand . She saw Merrik 's large hand extended toward her . Slowly , she placed her hand into his and followed him out of the outer chamber . He released her hand the moment they were within the sleeping chamber . He did n't look at her at all , just began to strip off his clothes . He said as he pulled his tunic over his head , his voice muffled , " What are you , Laren , a merchant 's daughter ? An innkeeper 's niece ? I know you were n't a slave before two years ago . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would n't have been beyond your childhood otherwise . " She said nothing . When he was naked , he turned to see her sitting on the side of the box bed , fully clothed , her hands in her lap . She was staring at him , at his flat belly , furred with soft blond hair , then downward . Her face was flushed , her lips slightly parted . LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 187  | " Stop looking at me , " he said , utterly infuriated with her for testing him so . " Have you no sense ? Do you so quickly forget what I did to you last night ? Take off your clothes and go to sleep . You must still be too sore for me to have you again . " Still she did n't move . His sex began to swell , he could no more prevent it any more than he could the rising of the sun . " You want more of the pain you endured last night ? " She shook her head , still silent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I played my part in front of Erik , but now I wish only to sleep . " His sex was jutting forward , hard and ready . His heart pounded ; he ached with need for her , damn her . She 'd been looking at his face , but when she gasped , he knew she was staring at him again . He said nothing more , merely eased down onto the bed . The chamber was dark now for she 'd doused the oil lamp . He heard the rustle of her clothes , but did n't move . " Your story is passing strange . Is it more than just a simple tale , I wonder ? " " That 's all it is , Merrik , a simple tale . " She could practically hear him thinking in the darkness , gnawing on questions about her and Taby . She sought to distract him , saying , " Letta told me that she did n't mind that I was your whore because you could use me . I guess she meant you could practice on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , perhaps you could have benefited from practice last night , but I do n't really know . " Ah , she heard him suck in his breath . She 'd gotten her distraction all right . She hoped he would n't strangle her . She continued , her voice mocking , " I fancied myself as some sort of target and your coming at me as a mighty sword . You did n't miss the target , but it was n't a clean  | kill either , speaking as the target , of course . I suppose swords do n't mind so long as it is a kill for them . In any case , she is pleased that I will give you the use of my body until you and she are wedded . " " She is more a child than Taby . " He was infuriated with himself that he 'd spoken thusly to Laren . What he would do with Letta was his affair and no other 's . " On occasion , " he added , " most women are like children . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness . He said after a long moment , battling with himself to just keep quiet and ignore her baiting words , but he found he could n't , " I do n't like your insulting comparison . What nonsense is this  --  you a target and I a sword ? What do you mean , I need more practice ? " " I mean that I asked Sarla about how a man and a woman mated . She assured me it did n't hurt after the first time and even the first time it was n't bad if the man was gentle and experienced . It was pleasant for a while , she said , then she became very silent and said no more . Thus , perhaps you do need practice , Merrik . At least for that first time . " He felt roiling anger at her , but more at himself . He 'd been a clod . " Do you still hurt ? " " Aye . " " I wo n't practice on you again until you are completely healed and ready for me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned insults . Aye , they are insults , you just cloak them in your gentle guile . " " I told you , Merrik , that last night would be the only time . It is a pity that I wo n't ever know if mating can be pleasurable , but I wo n't allow myself to become more interested in you , as a man , that is . " " Then why were you staring at me , your eyes as bright as a child 's staring at honeyed apple slices ? I showed interest only because my man 's body is like LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 189  | that . It responds when a woman stares , even you . There is nothing I can do to stop it . Not that I want to come inside you again , the gods know I do n't . " He stopped himself . He was making little sense , blatantly lying both to himself and to her . He was burying himself in a hole that would send him to the bottom of the fjord if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Absolutely nothing at all , and he waited and waited , unwilling to say more . Then he heard her breath even into sleep . He wanted to strangle her . By all the gods , practice ! He 'd learned well to pleasure women , his father had seen to that , as had the wonderful Gunnvor when he 'd been but twelve years old , when she 'd taken him in hand , literally . Surely it was n't his fault that he 'd wanted her so badly he 'd been forced to come into her before it was wise . Surely . All awoke the next morning to a flood of rain . Tempers flared quickly at the enforced inactivity , men yelled at each other , fights broke out , children fought and shrieked with as great enthusiasm as the men . Even the animals were surly , a small goat biting one of Thoragasson 's men on his ankle . It was Cleve who suggested to Merrik that Laren continue the story . " Aye , " he said , grinning at the man he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic around them . It will keep heads on shoulders , and hands from around throats . " " It will do nothing about the goat , " Merrik said , but agreed . And so it was still before noonday , when everyone had finally fallen silent , that Laren began again . " ... Rolf wandered deeper and deeper into the forest . The thick canopy of trees kept the sun from warming him . He knew he was searching for a beast to kill him , but none appeared . Aye , there were lynxes and rabbits ,  | even braces of pheasants that lurched into the air when he came upon them suddenly , but nothing larger than a fox . " The third day of his wandering , he came to the edge of a small meadow . It was the most beautiful meadow he 'd ever seen and he knew he 'd never seen it before , and he wondered at that , for he 'd grown up here , hunted in this forest . Yet here was this beautiful meadow , carpeted with flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his body . Suddenly , as he stood there , wondering perhaps if his wits were failing him , he saw on the far side of the meadow a beautiful creature that looked like a small horse . It did n't move , just stood there , sniffing the soft morning air , its thick white tail swishing . But somehow , Rolf knew the animal was n't the least afraid of him . " The creature was ducking its head up and down , as if inviting Rolf to come closer . Rolf slowly walked toward the animal . He realized as he drew closer that it was n't a horse at all , or any other kind of animal he 'd ever seen before . It turned to face him fully now , and he saw a horn growing upward in the middle of its forehead . And the horn was gold . " He walked to the creature and slowly reached out his hand . " The creature snorted , then stretched out his beautiful white head and laid his muzzle in Rolf 's palm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would speak aloud to a creature . " To his utter astonishment , the creature said softly , I am a unicorn , Rolf , ah , but I am also more . You are weak from wandering about in the woods . Go back to your longhouse , then tomorrow return here . ' " The unicorn turned then , rearing onto its hind legs , its beautiful white mane and tail arching and flying , LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 191  | and galloped back into the depths of the forest . Rolf would swear he heard the voice calling to him , Do not forget your weapons tomorrow , for ' t is dangerous in the forest . ' " Rolf went back to his longhouse , stunned that it took him only an hour to return . His brothers were relieved to see him and gave him good food and wine and ceased in their bedeviling of him . They clapped him on the back and told him how happy they were that he 'd come back . He found himself telling them about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told them that the unicorn had spoken to him and told him to return to it on the morrow . Did n't they think that curious ? What did they think of this creature who had suddenly appeared to him ? " He then asked his brothers what they would do . Ragnor wondered if his brother had lost his wits and dreamed about this strange creature . He said only , You said the horn was of gold ? ' " And Rolf said , Aye , ' t was of pure gold if my eyes were n't deceiving me . ' " Both brothers fell silent , deep in their thoughts . " Laren paused , then smiled toward Olaf Thoragasson . " If you were Rolf , my lord , what would you do about the unicorn ? " Olaf Thoragasson pounded his big fists on his thighs . " Why , I would kill the creature and cut away its golden horn . I would sell it to the richest prince in the world and become just as rich myself . " After the cheers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Erik . " And what would you do , my lord ? " Erik gave her a long , lazy smile . " I would not kill the creature . I would bring it back to my longhouse and I would treat it as tenderly as I would treat a woman . It  | speaks , and thus I would gain its trust . It would have a mate . I would find that mate , and keep them together . Surely they would have offspring and then I would have more golden-horned creatures . Thus I would become even richer than Olaf Thoragasson . " The cheering filled the smoke-hazed room . Finally , Laren turned to Merrik . " And you , my lord ? What would you do ? " Merrik was stroking Taby 's hair . He looked up at her as she spoke . He was silent for many moments , then shrugged and said , " I would do naught of anything so quickly . I would return to the meadow and see what the magical creature had to tell me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodding his head in approval . " Continue , girl . Tell us what hap-pened . " " This time Rolf did as Merrik advised . He did n't want to react so quickly . He 'd already done that and lost himself a friend and a slave of great talent , and , he suspected when the night was at its darkest , some of his honor . The following day , he returned to the meadow . He 'd wondered how he would find it , but just as suddenly , he stepped through a thicket of maple trees , and there it was , the sun shining brightly down upon it , the flowers wafting out sweet scents in a light breeze . The unicorn stood on the other side of the meadow , calmly watching Rolf walk to him . He allowed Rolf to muzzle his head . He allowed Rolf to stroke his golden horn . " Rolf said , The horn is pure gold ? ' " If a unicorn could smile , this one did , and it said , Aye , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My brothers gave me advice . They told me to either kill you and steal your golden horn or capture you and then your mate and thus have both of you and then your offspring . '  | " I do not think I like your brothers , ' the unicorn said . What do you wish to do , Rolf ? ' " I wish to speak to you , to learn who and what you are . I have never before seen a creature like you . Who sent you ? ' " It 's true I am magical , ' the unicorn said . But I am also more . I am also your former slave , the one you smote with your sword . ' " Rolf stared at the creature . He drew his sword for he was certain the beast would try to kill him . He 'd come back for revenge . He stood there , his sword poised in his hand , and the unicorn did nothing , did n't gallop away from him or attempt to protect himself in any way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , he lowered it , and said , I can not do it . When I killed you before , I knew such horror at myself that I came here to the forest to die . But you found me instead . Tell me what to do , for I wish to atone for taking your life . If you choose to kill me , I will make no move against you . ' " The unicorn nodded his beautiful white head , the golden horn glistening in the bright sunlight . Then , quite suddenly , he seemed to fade into nothing more than shadow and light , until Rolf knew he could see the sunlight through the creature 's body , so pale had it become . He knew terror such as he 'd never known . He fell to his knees , and clasped his arms around himself , waiting to die . But then as the unicorn was disappearing , something else was coming together and gaining darkness with the light and substance with the shadows . It was the slave he had smote with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted him up . He said , The gods have granted us both another chance . Come with me , Rolf , and we will journey together back to my family , for they miss me sorely . Come . ' " Rolfs two brothers never saw him again . They  | mourned him even as they believed him to have lost his wits , for surely the unicorn had killed him , and he 'd trusted the beast , trusted him , and look what it had gotten him . " But then there came a story into Vestfold told by a very old skald , toothless and scrawny , with thin bowed legs . All doubted he had anything worthwhile to say , but when he opened his mouth , all fell under his magic . He told about a man called Rolf the Viking , a man who was strong and fierce , a man to be trusted in all things , a man splendid of body and of face , and a man who was wiser than most men should be at such a young age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for it was known that once Rolf had been tested and had finally learned the way to true honor and worthiness . " And his brothers wondered , even as they shook their heads in disbelief at their thoughts . Surely , they reasoned , there were many Rolfs who were tested and found worthy , but nonetheless , both wanted to question the old skald the next morning . When they went to search him out , he was gone , the men at the palisade gates said , gone with the rising of the sun , ah , but he had n't disappeared with the sun , but rather into it , fading and fading , becoming as gold as the brilliance of the growing dawn light until he was simply gone . The brothers looked at each other . From that day onward , neither of them ever again mentioned either their brother or the strange appearance and disappearance of the old skald and his tale of Rolf the Viking . " Laren smiled directly at Merrik quite without realizing it . He looked at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister , a frown on his small face . Taby said quite clearly , " Laren , I remember the unicorn . "  | SHE STARED AT Taby , then said , her voice as smooth as the soft hair on Merrik 's belly , " That 's because I 've told you stories about magical creatures . I must have told you about a unicorn . Come now , sweeting , go play with Eila . See , she wants to throw the ball to you . Do play with her , Taby , it will keep her thumb out of her mouth . " Merrik started to say something , then stopped . He watched Taby run over to the little girl who was able to hold the feather-filled leather ball in one hand , and keep the thumb of her other hand in her mouth . Laren quickly moved away from him , not wanting his questions , at least now . Olaf Thoragasson said to her , " You brought us into your story . It is good . No skald has ever before done that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before she could say anything , before she could do naught more than shudder , he 'd left her and was walking toward Merrik , rubbing his big hands to-gether . Letta frowned after her father . When she turned back to Laren , she said , " It has stopped raining . Merrik and I will go for a walk down to the fjord . I think I will let him kiss me . He will know what it is like to kiss an innocent virgin . "  | " Ah , so you will let him practice on you , Letta ? " The girl moved quickly , whirling about , the palm of her hand cracking hard against Laren 's cheek . Laren stumbled back with the force of the blow , and Letta hit her again , this time shoving her onto the ground . Laren knew she should accept the blows , knew indeed that she 'd called them upon herself with her mocking words , but she could n't stop herself . She jumped to her feet and was upon Letta in an instant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , winding and winding , until the girl was yelling and crying and but inches from Laren 's face . " Listen to me , you ill-bred witch . You will not ever strike me again . If you dare , I will remove all your pretty white teeth , one by one . " She quickly unwound the thick braid and gave Letta a shove . She fell back into Merrik 's arms . Letta saw quickly who it was who was holding her , burst into tears , and whipped around , pressing herself against him , sobbing into his chest . Merrik looked at Laren over her head . He saw the imprint of Letta 's hand on her face , and the rage , and then he saw the instant she realized what she 'd done . Olaf Thoragasson lunged forward like an enraged bull . He saw Erik rubbing his hands together . Quickly , Merrik lifted Letta off the ground and handed her to her younger brother , the one who had so charmingly and witlessly given Laren his mother 's brooch , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stepped to Laren , grabbed her arm , and hauled her against his side . He said both to her and to all who were staring at them , " She is my slave . I will see to her punishment . " Erik said , " And her punishment , brother ? I wonder how severe it will be . " LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 197  | " Were she stronger I would whip her . But she is n't strong enough yet to survive it . She will cook for the next three days . Sarla , will you make her obey you when I am not present to do so ? " Sarla grinned widely at her and shook her fist . " Aye , Merrik , I will hit her with a pot if she does n't willingly do the cooking . " " No insolence from you , Sarla ! " Erik was flushed with anger as he strode toward his wife , his right hand a sudden fist . " It was n't insolence , brother , " Merrik said , jerking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She was simply jesting . A simple jest , nothing more . " " Still , I wo n't have her speaking to you like that . " " If I took offense then I would tell her so . Forget it , Erik . " " ' T is none of your affair , brother . " Erik paused a moment , then turned quickly , sidestepped his brother , and struck Sarla open-palmed on her face . " There , " he said , watching her struggle to keep her balance , her hand rubbing her cheek . " You will mind your tongue in the future . " He turned to Merrik . " You see how you must treat a wife . No more will I have to bear her insolence , no more . " Merrik 's hands were fisted at his sides . Laren ran to Sarla , but Erik shoved her aside . " Keep away from her , slave . By all the gods , you push me to violence . " There was no sound for several moments just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men and women all still in their places , afraid to say a word . Even the children were quiet , staring at their parents , uncertain what to do . Then Letta shrieked , " She said she would pull all my teeth out ! One by one ! Hit her , Merrik , she deserves it . " Merrik easily controlled the laughter welling up in-  | side him , laughter mixed with his absolute fury at Erik . It was a helpless fury , for he knew he could n't gainsay his brother in his own longhouse . He realized in that moment that he had to leave , he had to find a new home where he would be master . He turned to Letta and said , " You gave as good as you got , Letta . She is a skald . Of course she could frighten you with the imagery of her words . Hold your peace now , ' t is over . " He turned to look at the faces of his men ; at Deglin , who looked disappointed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; at Old Firren who was whittling a chair post , his eyes fixed on his work ; and finally at Cleve , whose face was white with the effort it cost him to keep still . Taby , thank the gods , as well as the other children , had turned away , all of them playing again , shouting and arguing , seeing nothing now . Thoragas-son 's men looked uncertain , many looking in any direction if Letta was n't in it . He imagined they did n't have much affection for Letta , and they much more enjoyed Laren 's stories . Merrik looked at Sarla . Her head was down , and he knew she was humiliated , crushed by her husband 's actions . He saw that Letta would say more , and quickly added , " Until it is time for her to sweat over the fire pit , I will take her to the fields and she can work there . " He did n't add that he would be working next to her . Without another word , he dragged her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone with him , but he thought an impression of reluctance , perhaps fear , on her part , would calm everyone 's ire . The sun was bright overhead . The ground was still damp , but the sun had dried most of the mud puddles . She suddenly dug in her heels and yelled , " Stop dragging me ! " He turned and grinned down at her . " It was a good LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 199  | act . But now there 's no more need for it . " He released her arm and said over his shoulder , " Follow me and be quick about it . " She moved swiftly after him . He said over his shoulder , not slowing , " Remove all of her teeth , one by one . I like that . It 's a very effective threat . " " I thought so , " she said , skipping to come alongside him . He was silent . She could n't hold it in any longer . " I hate Erik . He is a bully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , struck her just to prove he was the stronger and that she was nothing . I 'm sorry since he is your brother , but I hate him . 0e is a bully and an animal . I know another man just like him . " " Who is he ? " She went sti11 . Then she just shook her head , saying nothing more . Merrik said slowly , not looking at her , " Erik has changed . " " I am relieved you did n't strike him after he 'd hurt Sarla . " " I wanted to . It would n't have been wise . I have no say in his longhouse e and I must remember that . " " I do n't want to stay here . " " I have been thinking of that as well . " She waited , but he said no more . Laren said , with some reluctance , " I 'm sorry I wanted to pull her hair from her silly head , but she enraged me and I lost my temper . " " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you would have learned to keep your tongue behind your teeth . " " Aye , one would think that would have happened . " " But it did n't . I remember too clearly your back after  | Thrasco had beaten you for your lack of wisdom . " " Aye , ' t is a fault that will probably kill me . " " What did she say to you ? " " She said that she would walk with you and perhaps let you kiss her so you would know what it was like to kiss an innocent virgin . " " I see . I do n't suppose you said anything back to her to make her slap you ? " Laren shrugged , not looking at him , but at the waving barley in the field . " Naught much of anything really , just something about her letting you practice on her . It made her very angry . " He laughed . " Aye , that was naught of anything . You mocked her apurpose . ' T was not well done of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . He looked away from her then , and gazed upward where the fir trees were thick and full-leafed . " I had never heard of a unicorn before . " " As I told everyone , they 're mythical creatures , mag-ical . " " With horns on their foreheads of pure gold . " " Aye . " He paused a moment then said as he stroked his hand over a barley stalk , " Your tale interested me . I do n't suppose by any chance it was a test ? " " Aye , " she said , looking at him steadily . " I know you wo n't sell Taby back to me , no matter the amount of silver I have . " " You are finally right about something . I am pleased that finally you understand I will never let him go . " " And when you marry Letta ? Merrik , please think . She would hate him just because he is my brother . " " You will not worry about that . " Laren said nothing more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others were working , he LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 201  | set her to looking closely at the birds flying overhead . " Keep them away from the crop . " He said nothing more to her . She found herself staring at him , not wanting to really , but still she stared , watching him bend over , then straighten and stretch , his body strong and powerful , the sweat gleaming off his flesh beneath the afternoon sun . She wanted him . She knew a sharp feeling of hunger and knew it was him she wanted . But she held her peace . She had to hold herself away from him . He dismissed her in the middle of the afternoon to eat . The sky was no longer overcast , the rain of the morning long before moved northward . The sun was brilliant overhead . Laren thought of food , realized there was something more important to her than warm bread for the first time in two years , and walked quickly toward the trail that led upward to the summit of an outjutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at it several times in the past days , wanting very much to climb to the top to see the magnificent scenery , but knowing that her body was n't yet strong enough . Her body was strong enough now . She set out at a brisk walk , keeping her eye on the sun . She did n't want to be gone too long from the field . She did n't want to be gone too long from Merrik 's side . She thought about that , thought about him smiling at her , laughing , stripping off his clothes , coming into her body , holding her close , giving her pleasure until he 'd hurt her , but surely that was n't his fault , but her own body 's , unused to a man . She wanted him again , very much . It was stronger now , this wanting . She looked at him and felt a quickening that was both frightening and exhilarating . But she would be a fool to allow herself the pleasure of him . The path steepened ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her breath was becoming la-  | bored . She hated it , this weakness of her body . She looked at the top , not too far distant now , and kept looking until she was there , finally , breathing hard , a stitch beginning in her side . But she 'd made it . She straightened and walked to the edge . The view was more magnificent than she 'd imagined . The fjord below made many turns , curving inward , then winding sharply outward , the dark blue flowing forever beyond the eye . She gazed at the fir-covered uplands opposite the fjord where no one had touched the land , for it was too steep , too irregular , with sharp faces falling hundreds of feet to the water . She turned now to gaze down at Malverne with all its slightly sloping or flat land given entirely over to farming . The wooden palisade looked like a near perfect circle from her vantage point , with its pointed wooden spikes standing high that would surely gut any enemy who tried to scale them . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large rectangular longhouse . Smoke snaked upward , a thin blue line that disappeared into the sweet air , and she fancied she could smell Sarla 's cooking . Toward the back of the enclosure , she saw the burial site and the temple . She knew Merrik had visited his parents ' graves many times , always returning to the longhouse quiet , his head and shoulders bowed . She knew he grieved deeply for them , but she 'd said nothing . What could she say ? She could n't speak to him of her own parents ' deaths because he would want to know who they were and he would push her and push her . She knew she would tell him soon . He 'd been right about her tale being a test . She could trust him ; she had to , it was that simple . She sat down , not too far from the edge of the cliff , and leaned back against a rock . She hoped Sarla was all right . She hoped Letta 's scalp hurt . Then she  | thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in the past , aye , many , she thought , as her eyes slowly closed . " I saw you come up here . I waited to see if my brother would come after you but he did n't . Then I followed you . " She heard his voice in a half-sleep , far away , a caressing voice , one filled with satisfaction , but still only a voice and it could n't hurt her , could n't frighten her . " No one else saw you , or me , come up here . This place is called Raven 's Peak . In recent years there have been fewer attacks by other Vikings , thus it is no longer much used as a lookout point . No , it is a lovers ' place now , and you are here , Laren . " More than a voice now . There was gloating in it and pleasure , the sort of pleasure a man would find if he caught a woman alone , unawares , a woman he knew was his for the taking . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are awake , Laren . I thought perhaps you were coming here to meet a man  --  as I said , it is that sort of place  --  but you are alone . I am pleased . You turned Merrik away or did n't he want you in the middle of the day ? " She opened her eyes and stared up at Erik . It was hard to see his face because the sun was directly behind him . If she did n't know him , she would have believed , briefly , that he was a god , golden and radiant , so very big . Slowly , Laren eased up , scraping her back against the rock . It made her wince , but she said nothing , merely moved up until she was sitting . Then , very slowly , she stood , her hand back against the rock . " It is late , " she said . " I must return to the fields . Merrik will expect me . " " Why did you come here ? " 204 Catherine Coulter  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of your land . I wanted to see for myself . " " As I said , many men and women have come here to couple . " " I came only to look . " " I came to have you . I wo n't wait longer . Perhaps you knew I would follow you if only you managed to get away from Merrik . Is that what you wanted ? " " No , I do n't wish you to hurt me , Erik . I must go now . " She whirled about even as she spoke , but she was n't fast enough . He was as strong as Merrik , and his long fingers dug into her upper arm . " You are still too thin . My fingers can wrap about your arm . Do n't try to run from me again . I do n't like it . " She turned back to face him now , looking up at his face , now brutal to her , its beauty masked by his lust . She remembered that long-ago night , how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be faint . Somehow she did n't think she could succeed with the same ploy with Erik . " I do n't wish to couple with you . I belong to Merrik . Why would you want to anger your brother ? Do you not love him ? Is there not honor between you ? " His eyes narrowed on her face ; his fingers worked on her arm , squeezing still , but not hurting her now . He said easily , as if to a half-wit , " You think yourself above Caylis and Megot because you weave a tale well . You are not . Listen to me , Laren , I am now the lord of Malverne , not my father , not my brother . I am the master of all you see from here . I have waited and waited for my turn and it was long in coming . I wanted to leave , to make my own way , perhaps voyage to Iceland , but my father begged me not to , told me that I was the future lord of Malverne and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents died , but with all their damned  | words , their damned promises , I was still but a son , someone to be governed by them , naught more . But it is different now . Even Sarla now sees that she will be what I wish her to be . I had not struck her before , for my parents defended her , even though she is barren and useless to a man . At least now she will obey me without question and tread lightly around me . " " Erik , I am not a wife . I am naught of anything . I am useless as well . You have said I am too thin . It is true . Please , Erik , do n't hurt me . " He smiled down at her and now he grasped her other arm . He pulled her against him and she realized he was as tall as Merrik , as strong and as big . She would have no chance against him , none . She did n't want him to rape her . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head and looked at him straightly . " Do n't do this or you will regret it . " The moment the words were out of her mouth , she knew she 'd made a mistake . A woman did n't threaten him . She watched his eyes narrow until they were slits , she saw the pulse pounding in his neck . He was furious and now she would regret it . She did regret it . He slapped her hard , just as he had his wife . She caught the cry in her throat . She would n't give him the pleasure of hearing her cry out . " Now , " he said , and kissed her hard , his mouth grinding against hers , his teeth cutting her lower lip . One of his hands clutched her right breast and he kneaded her furiously , hurting her . His other hand was ripping her tunic , but the material was sturdy . He reared back , took both of his hands and grasped the neck of her gown and jerked . She heard the rip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He loosened his grip just enough in his shock . She jerked away from him , running frantically  | down the narrow winding path . She heard him bellow behind her , but she did n't turn around . She heard him groaning , gasping for breath from the blow she 'd dealt him . But still , she was terrified that he was behind her , almost upon her , and any moment now she would feel his hot breath , his clutching hands on her arms , spinning her around , and striking her hard . Then he would rape her and then he would kill her . She ran until she tripped , falling on the steep path until she struck a rock . She saw an explosion of white , then she saw noth-ing . She did n't know how much time had passed when she awoke , slowly , her head spinning , her eyes unfocused . She shook her head , and felt the lump over her left ear . Pain coursed through her , striking hard behind her eyes . Suddenly she remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself upright . She stood there , weaving , trying to gain her balance and control the pounding in her head . She was listening , hard . There was no sound , nothing . Erik was n't in sight . Had she only been unconscious for an instant ? Was he still there on top of the path , still on his knees , still holding his belly ? Fear rushed through her , clearing her head . She did n't wait , she stumbled down the path , not stopping until she reached the bottom and then she halted against a fir tree to catch her breath . Her heart pounded , her side ached , her back , nearly healed , was now pulling and throbbing . As for her leg , she felt nothing , which , she supposed , was a good sign . " By all the gods , where have you been ? " It was Merrik striding toward her , yelling . " I thought you 'd gotten yourself attacked by a wild animal or you 'd fallen into the water and drowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it was from fear for her . She tried to smile at him , a miserable effort , but still her best effort . " Nay , I 'm all right . I wanted to see the view from the top yon . It is glorious , Merrik , so very beautiful , with the water winding like a snake and ? " " Damn you , be quiet ! Who ripped your gown ? Who ? " He was on her then and he grasped her upper arms just as his brother had done , but immediately he gentled . He stared down at her , gaining control of himself . He 'd been frantic with fear , and he 'd hated that damned fear that had driven him wild . He calmed . He saw then that she was heaving , that her face was without color , the pulse in her throat pounding wildly above the rent in her gown . " Who ? " he said again . " Who did this to you ? " He saw her wince , saw her make an unconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more slowly , " Tell me what happened . " " I fell , nothing more , I just fell and knocked myself out for a moment . I 'm all right now , Merrik . " But even as she spoke , she was looking back over her shoulder , up the narrow path . " And when you fell you ripped your gown ? By all the gods , tell me who did this to you ! " He felt her pulling away from him even though she was n't really moving . He realized then that she was terrified . He drew her close , his hands stroking lightly up and down her back . Then he remembered Thrasco 's beating , and brought his hands up to her shoulders and her neck , massaging her , soothing her . " Tell me what hap-pened . " " I want to go back to the longhouse . Please , Merrik , I wish to go now , I must ! " Her fear was palpable . He frowned down at her . " Nei-  | ther of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She began to tremble , she could n't help herself . She knew Merrik would fight his brother , he would n't hold back , she knew it . " He 's up there , I know it . He ripped my gown but no more , nothing more , I swear it . I hurt him , kicked him just as I kicked you in Kiev , and I heard him screaming after me and then he was moaning loudly . But now he must be all right . He will come down and he will see me with you and he will take me away or you 'll fight him and I ca n't bear that , not brother against brother ! " He said not a word , merely looked back up the winding , rutted path . She struggled against him now , so frightened that she was trembling , her flesh cold beneath his fingers . " How long were you unconscious ? " " I do n't know ! I do n't know ! Please , Merrik , let me go , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen to me . You left me to return to the longhouse over an hour ago . I got worried and began to look for you . " " An hour ? " She stared up at him blankly . " Oh no , that ca n't be right . No , that 's too long . No , that is n't right , Merrik ! " Suddenly she felt his fingers tighten around her arms . She turned to see Oleg striding toward them , Old Firren behind him . Merrik said , " Laren , you will remain here . Do not leave this spot . Do you understand me ? " " Why ? Where are you going ? Why ? " Her voice was shrill and she was shaking . He cursed , then grabbing her hand , he pulled her after him . " Come , Oleg , Firren . We must see that Erik is all right . " They found him sprawled at the top , facedown , his LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 209  | right leg dangling over the cliff edge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite dead . In his right hand he held a scrap of wool . Merrik recognized it before Laren did . Erik had torn it from her gown .  | " AYE , POOR SLAVE , you killed him and now you 'll die . I shall try not to smile when the last breath leaves your miserable body . I will go away by myself and laugh and know pleasure that you are gone forever . I wo n't fear your ghost , for they will bury you so deep that even your evil will die . " Laren stared up at Letta 's face , barely discernible in the dim light of Merrik 's sleeping chamber . She 'd been sound asleep , deep in a frightening darkness that held her unmoving and terrified . And now Letta 's voice , low and vicious and filled with glee . Still it was better than that nothingness , those obscure shadows that would have sucked away her life . " Aye , now you 'll pay , you miserable whore , you 'll pay . You 're only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you killed him and now Merrik will kill you , it 's his duty as Erik 's brother . " " I did n't kill Erik . " " Liar . No one else was seen on the path . Just you and Erik . No one else . You 're naught but a slave . No one believes your denials . Even now the men are discussing what to do with you , and let me tell you , whore , Merrik holds himself silent . He is n't taking your side . " " I did n't kill Erik , " she said again , listening to the LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 211  | hollow ring of her own voice , knowing that no one would believe her , no one at all . " Aye , you 've slept for a very long time . Sarla thought it would be best for you , the stupid cow . She did n't want the men killing you if you had dared to come to Erik 's burial , ah , and they would have , they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep , to protect you , but it wo n't matter , because you 'll be dead , as dead as Erik whom you killed . " " Is Sarla all right ? " Letta smiled then . " Aye , she is fine . She has lost a man who occasionally punished her for her insolence , but much more than that , she has lost Malverne , though she does n't realize it-yet . Now it belongs to Merrik , no one else , least of all that stupid cow , who is as barren as a fifty-year-old grandmother . There are only Erik 's bastards , none of them legitimate because Erik was a young man and thus thought himself immortal and did n't even make Kenna legitimate . It was a pity , but not for me , not for Merrik , who now owns everything , as far as the eye can see . " Aye , Malverne is Merrik 's now . When we wed , I will be mistress here and both you and Sarla will be gone , I will see to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He will want to make me happy . I will be his wife and thus he will do what I wish him to . " " What are you doing in here , Letta ? " It was Merrik silhouetted in the opening , his hand shoving aside the bearskin covering . " I was just seeing if she was awake now , my lord , " Letta said in a softly sweet voice . " Sarla sent me to rouse her . It is odd that Erik 's widow would think so highly of the slave who murdered her husband . " Letta straightened , then walked slowly to Merrik.  | She stood in front of him , gazing up at him , and touched her fingertips to his forearm . " I am so very sorry , Merrik . First your parents and now this slave killed your brother . I do understand , my lord , for I lost my older sister only two years ago when I was already grown . ' T is a miserable thing . " " Go to your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patted his arm again , and left . Merrik strode to the box bed and stared down at her . " At least there are no new bruises or burns or lash marks on you this time . " She merely shook her head . He had n't seen her breast , thank the gods for that . Erik had hurt her in his frenzy , bruising her badly . " It is over , " he said . " My brother is surely gone from us now . " He pictured his brother carried down from the steep path , he himself looking down at his bloodied head as he carried his shoulders , saw the women cleaning him and garbing him in his finery . His body was n't brought into the longhouse , for all feared that a ghost would come and do them ill . Thus he was carried to the burial grounds and placed gently , feet first , into the deep hole dug beside his father 's grave . His sword , his axe , and his favorite knife were buried with him , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock than sorrow , the pain would come later . He wondered how much Erik had changed since their parents had died . Had he turned most of his people against him with his arrogance , his conceit ? Had he made an enemy who would have crushed his head with a rock ? It seemed unlikely . Sarla 's face showed only shock , no sorrow , no relief , nothing , though it was difficult to tell since one cheek was nearly purple from the blow Erik had dealt her . He himself had led the prayers to the gods  --  to Odin LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 213  | All-Father , to Thor Redbeard , to Loki the Spirit of Evil , extolling Erik 's bravery in battle , his honor , and to Saeter the underworld god , pledging his own word that Erik did n't belong there and so Saeter would gain nothing in this death . He begged them to accept Erik Haraldsson over the rainbow bridge and into heaven , to reward him for all eternity , to bless him in his final journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bloodied head . He had closed his eyes , words had been beyond him . So much death , too much death . His parents and now his elder brother . Had Erik spoken the words over their parents ' bodies ? Had he felt tears burning his eyes as he 'd spoken ? Had his voice broken and had he swallowed , trying to continue , to see all the rites and rituals done properly ? Suddenly , Merrik had felt a small hand clutch his . He 'd looked down to see Taby , the child 's face filled with misery because he knew something was wrong with Merrik , he just did n't understand what it was . Merrik leaned down and picked up the child , bringing him against his chest . He kissed his warm cheek , felt the child 's thin arms clutch around his throat . No one had said anything , even Letta , even Olaf Thoragasson . No one had said anything about Laren to him either , but he knew that all wondered what he would do . He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he was the master of Malverne now . It was his thoughts that counted , his commands that ruled , none other 's . He looked down at her now . His silence had been long and she 'd kept quiet . Her eyes were closed , but her hands were fisted at her sides . " I did n't kill him , Merrik . I did n't . I kicked him in the groin and ran hard until I tripped and knocked myself out . Please , you must believe me. "  | " I can see you flat on your back , Erik on top of you , jerking at your gown , wanting to strip you and rape you . I can see you frantic to defend yourself . I can see you picking up a rock and striking his head . I do not blame you for that , Laren . You were a fool to go up to Raven 's Peak by yourself . And now my brother is dead because his lust pushed him to rape the wrong woman . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All believe you guilty . " " I did n't kill him ! " " As a slave you have no rights at all . As a slave , killing a man of Erik 's status , your death would be long and painful . It would be I who would kill you . " He stopped then , staring down at her white face . He rose . " What will you do ? " " I do n't know . But I do know I can not allow Taby 's sister to die . He would never forgive me . " Relief that was oddly mixed with pain at his words shot through her . Only Taby 's sister ? " Why will you not believe me , Merrik ? " " Why should I ? You have told me nothing since I saved your hide in Kiev . Not where you came from , not about your family , nothing . So little you 've told me , and what I have finally pried out of you has been wrapped in mysteries and puzzles . Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shout . Merrik said sharply , " Stay here ! " He was gone from the chamber in an instant , . Laren behind him , holding up her torn gown . Two of Erik 's men were holding Cleve , a third was beating him . It was Deglin who was shouting for them to kill the miserable slave . Merrik caught one man 's wrist and jerked him away , LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 215  | throwing him to the ground . He kicked another man from his path . " Let him go . " The two men looked at Merrik , but they did n't know him as well as they 'd known his brother . His voice was low , very controlled . One of them said , even as he bent Cleve 's arm nearly to the breaking point , " He came with her , Merrik . We 'll beat the truth out of him , for surely she told him of killing Erik , surely he knows , perhaps he even helped her . " The other man struck Cleve hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . He grabbed the man , swung him about and sent his fist into his throat . " Release him or I 'll kill you . " Erik 's man was uncertain what to do . He saw Oleg running toward them and knew he would take Merrik 's side . He shouted to Erik 's men , " Come ! Help me ! It is justice ! " Merrik grabbed the man 's throat between his two hands and squeezed . He stared into the man 's face even as he bent him onto his knees , driving him slowly to the ground . The man tried to speak , but could n't . His eyes clouded and darkened . He slumped unconscious on the ground . Merrik stood over him . " Are there others who wish to hurt this man ? " " He 's a slave , " Olaf Thoragasson said , his voice quieter now , for he 'd seen Merrik 's anger and his violence . " Aye , Merrik , naught but a slave . Let the men have their sport . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slave , and they 're right , he came with her and probably knows the truth . Aye , let them break him . No one cares . " " I imagine that Cleve cares very much . " He turned to him . " Are you all right ? "  | " My arm hurts , but he did n't break it . I thank you , my lord . " " He 's a slave ! " Deglin shouted . " No he is n't , " Merrik said . He faced them all now , looking at each face in turn . " He is now a free man . All of you heed my words . Cleve is a free man . He is now my man . " " Ah , " Olaf Thoragasson said , " then if he is a free man , make him pay the Danegeld for Erik 's death . If he does n't have the Danegeld , then he must die , and by your hand . " " Wait ! " It was Deglin again . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let her die , for she is a slave . " Merrik merely shook his head . " Then he must pay the Danegeld ! " Deglin shrieked . " He murdered your brother , she with him . All know it ! " " There she is , ask her , ask her ! " Laren stood in the shadows , still and silent . Merrik knew she had silver from her stories , and some jewelry , but surely not enough for Danegeld , surely not enough for both her and Cleve . Cleve said to Merrik , his voice loud and strong , " My lord , Deglin is right . I killed Erik , not Laren . He had hurt her and she escaped him . I struck him with the rock in my anger . I alone am responsible . " " No ! " Laren ran to him , grabbing his arms , shaking him , making him look at her . " You will not lie , Cleve , not for me ! I did n't kill him and neither did you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing there , staring at her , fury on some faces , uncertainty on others . She saw Sarla standing by the fire pit , slowly stirring a boar-meat stew , saying nothing , her hand turning the giant wooden spoon , evenly , smoothly . " Of course you killed him , there is none other . " This was from one of Erik 's men . " He was much admired , a LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 217  | brave man , an honorable man . " " Aye , aye ! " Suddenly , Sarla called out , " Silence , all of you ! " Slowly , she walked through the people to Merrik . She raised her voice then and said , " I will not allow Cleve and Laren to be blamed . I killed Erik . I alone . He struck me many times since his parents died , since he became the lord here , and I hated him . He followed Laren to Raven 's Peak to rape her . All of you know how he lusted after her even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . His lust governed him . She fought him and managed to escape him . I saw her run away . Then I struck him dead . They had nothing to do with it . " There was pandemonium . Merrik looked at her breast , at the streaks of purple and yellow , at the blunt outlines of Erik 's fingers where he 'd kneaded her flesh deep and hard . He reached out his hand and lightly cupped her breast in his palm . She felt the warmth of him , the power of him , and she knew she wanted him more than she ever had , even now , when there was more pain and misery between them than ever before . She wanted to press against his hand . She wanted to lean into his strength , to feel him holding her , to know that he believed her and would stand beside her . She wanted to kiss him , to taste the heat of him , to experience again the incredible feelings he 'd given her once , so long ago now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmoving , and he felt only the stiffness of her , the wariness . Now he knew that she watched his hand , watched as his fingers lightly moved over the bruises , then she looked up and he could n't hide the fury in his eyes from her .  | He 'd come upon her without warning , and she 'd tried to cover herself , but she had n't been in time . He said , " Your gown is torn beyond repair . I will ask Sarla to give you another . " He slowly lifted his fingers from her breast then and turned away from her . He said , not looking at her , " Does your breast hurt ? " She shook her head , realized he was n't looking at her , and said , " No , not very much . " " A woman 's flesh is very tender there . You are lying . I 'm sorry my brother did that to you . But he is dead and that is more punishment than he deserved . " " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Sarla . They were just trying to protect me . " He laughed then , a low , deep laugh , and he was still laughing when he turned again to face her . The laughter suddenly died . " Cover yourself , " he said , and then she saw it  --  the hunger in him , the need . Was it just for her , or would any woman do ? She did , quickly , jerking the material up against her shoulder . She raised her chin , looking at him straightly . " Why ? You do not wish Taby to know that you were staring at his sister ? Would it upset him , this lust of yours , or do you merely look at me because there is no other woman who you believe belongs to you ? " " No , this time I had no thought of Taby , " he said . He walked to the box bed and sat down . He leaned forward , clasping his hands between his knees . He appeared to be studying the woven wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to me , Laren ? " " You seem to accept me thus since I am Taby 's sister . " " When I came into you , when I broke through your virginity and touched your womb , I had no thought of you as Taby 's sister . " " You speak bluntly , Merrik . " LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 219  | " Aye , and you welcomed me until I hurt you . Your breasts are beautiful . I had forgotten . " " Many women have beautiful breasts , no doubt even Letta . " " I do n't care about her breasts , truth be told . I wish she and her family would leave Malverne . " He paused a moment , then smiled bitterly down at his clasped hands . " I am the master here now . I believe I will tell them to go . I dislike Letta 's possessiveness and her father 's interference . I dislike her conceit . " He rose . " It is odd . I did n't want Malverne . I never considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , I would guard Malverne for him with my life until he was of an age to take it over . I can not give Malverne to Kenna , though the boy is smart and brave . He is a bastard and none would stand for it . This is a damnable situation . " " I did n't kill Erik . " He sighed . " I believe you . However , I can not be certain about Cleve . He is protective of you . If he saw that Erik was going to rape you , do n't you believe he could have easily struck him down ? " " Yes , he could have , but he did n't . Do n't you understand ? If Cleve killed him , he would have run back down that same path . He would have seen me unconscious . He would have known that I would be blamed . " Suddenly Merrik raised his head . He smiled at her . " For that same reason , then , Sarla could n't have done it either . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , and I dislike mysteries . I thought the mystery of you and Taby would tease me into madness  --  your damnable lack of trust in me even though I passed your test  --  aye , that tale of yours was a test for me , to see if you could trust me ? but this is beyond that , far beyond , for Erik , despite his  | me feel as though my time here were nearly over . I wanted to slap her . " " Do n't worry about that one . Merrik said since Malverne is now his , he will send the Thoragassons on their way . Perhaps he will do it today . Why do n't you tell Letta that she will be gone from Malverne much more quickly than you . " Sarla looked up to see Letta walking toward them . " By that smug look on her face , I do n't think Merrik has yet told them to leave . " Laren wanted to keep her temper and she knew she would lose it if she remained . She heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , more quickly now , until she heard Letta call out , " Stop , slave ! I wish to speak to you . " She sighed , then turned . " What is it you wish now , Letta ? " " My father is with Merrik right now . He is bargaining over your purchase price . He wants you , for he believes you have some worth as a skald , but to have a murderess in his longhouse distresses him . He fears you might became angered at him and kill him . " Laren just stared at her . Sarla said , " That is nonsense , Letta , and well you know it . You will hold your tongue . You are a guest here , nothing more , and you will cease strutting yourself about as mistress . You will cease tormenting Laren . " " Tormenting her ! Ha ! She has a hide tougher than that boar you were skinning . " " It is just that your torments are very childlike , Letta , " Laren said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve as you gain years . It seems you are walking in that path . " Letta opened her mouth , but Laren forestalled her ,  | saying quickly , her voice very mean , " Remember your pretty teeth , Letta . One by one . Do you understand ? " Letta paled , turned on her heel , and left the long-house . Sarla laughed . " Aye , she is on that path , but she can still be halted in her petty tracks . " Cleve walked to them , and he was shaking his head . " I waited until she had left you . Laren , Merrik is even now holding a meeting to discuss Erik 's murder . Here they call it the Thing . It is what they do to determine guilt and search for fair answers . I came to tell you . Most still believe you guilty , but now , at least , they 're discussing it . " Caylis came forward to stand beside Cleve . " I do n't think you 're guilty , but if you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son and I would be safe . " She was right , but Laren said only , " I 'm sorry , Caylis , but believe me , I did not kill him . I can do nothing about my presence here , for Merrik controls that . " " Aye , but Caylis is right , " Megot said . " Because you came we will become as nothing . Perhaps Merrik will even give us to his men to be used at their whim . I pray that Merrik will make us his mistresses , but I know that he now takes only you to his bed . I heard him and Erik once speaking of such things and Erik said Merrik was stupid to want what their parents had shared . He told Merrik that he would come to understand his wish was as flimsy as a dream once he had wedded Letta . He said Merrik would leave her soon enough and search out other women to bed . " All of this in front of Sarla , Laren thought . She supposed it was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been too young to notice such things . There was no expression on Sarla 's face . None at all . Laren chanced to look at Cleve . She went very still . He was  | staring at Sarla , the look on his scarred face so tender , so very helpless , that she wanted to cry . There came a cry from outside the longhouse , then there was shouting and loud arguing . Then there was utter silence . Gradually they could hear the voices resume , heard the low rumblings of arguments , but controlled now . Then they heard Merrik 's voice but they could n't understand his words . Other voices were raised in question . " What is it ? " Sarla said , and rushed toward the door-way . Oleg appeared in the entrance . He looked at each of them until he found Laren . He said quietly , " You 'd best come now , Laren . Merrik has reached a decision and all will abide by it . "  | MERRIK WATCHED HER walk to him , Oleg at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until she was standing before him , then said very quietly , " You will come with me now . " He took her hand and led her away . She heard the men 's voices , some clearly angry , others simply questioning . Then she heard Oleg say loudly , " It is right and just . Merrik is the lord of Malverne now . We will all heed his wishes . " What wishes ? He continued silent until they had walked down the wide path to the fjord . He motioned to the pier . They walked out to the end and he pulled her down beside him , their feet dangling over the end of the pier . The water below was a calm light blue . She could see small ripples created by fish swimming just below the sur-face . The sun was bright overhead , the air soft and very warm . She could n't imagine snow covering everything . A cloud slid in front of the sun , but just for a moment . She waited silent . " You have two choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head to one side , staring now at his profile . Still he did n't turn to face her .  | " You will wed with me and remain here at Malverne . " He turned to face her as he spoke . " Why do you look so surprised ? Why do you shudder ? Very well , then . If being my wife displeases you so very much , why , then , you can select the second choice . I will see that you are returned to your family . However , Taby will remain with me . I am making him my son . " " No ! " " No what ? " She just stared at him , shaking her head back and forth . He supposed he was pleased that for once he 'd taken her utterly aback , but more than that , now he wanted her to tell him that she wanted to wed with him , that she " I can not wed you . " " Oh ? You can not or you will not ? " " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think it was Thrasco who was the hopeful husband , was it ? Or perhaps before you were a slave you were married off as a child ? " " No , no , nothing like that . " " No , of course you were n't married . You were very much a virgin when I took you . Ah , I see . I am too beneath you to consider as a husband . " " No , never . " " More puzzles , more mysteries . Very well , Laren . Do n't forget you are my slave . Regardless of what you were before , now you are nothing more than a slave , one that many of my people believe also a murderess . I offer you the moon and the stars  --  at least that 's how a slave would see wedding the master of a large holding such as Malverne . " She jumped to her feet and stared down at him . " You can not keep Taby . " LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 227  | " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more slowly , to face her . He took her upper arms in his big hands . ' Will you marry me or no ? " She looked into the fjord and saw a school of herring racing through the water , very close to the smooth surface , leaping above , like darts of silver . She felt she could reach into the water and catch one , so close they were . She looked up at him now . She wanted to smooth the frown from his forehead , as she said very calmly , " I can not marry you because I was promised to Askhold , heir of Rognvald , king of the Danelaw . " He jerked back as if she 'd struck him . What she said was madness , surely . . . He stared at her , then at her loose-fitting gown and overtunic , not old or ragged , for it was Sarla 's , just very plain and too big for her , not garb the future queen of the Danelaw would wear . Something violent moved within him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he 'd accepted her and he knew he 'd accepted her for a very long time now , for probably longer than he realized . He believed her , tamped down on the fury raging deep within him , and said mildly , " The truth at last . Tell me the rest of it . " Taby is indeed a prince . He and I were abducted from my sleeping chamber two years ago , and sold to a slave trader in the Rhineland . " " Who is your father ? " " Our father , Hallad , is dead . However , Taby is the second male in line to succeed his uncle . " " His uncle , Laren ? " She drew in a deep breath . " I have n't said his name aloud in two years . Our uncle is Rollo , called the first duke by the Frankish king , Charles the Simple . As you know , he ceded Normandy to Rollo so that he would defend France against the raids of other Vikings . "  | This time he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt as if he 'd been kicked by a horse . " The famous Rollo , " Merrik said more to himself than to her . " I was raised on tales about the brave and ferocious Rollo . He is truly your uncle ? " " Aye , my father was his older brother . Rollo was wedded to a girl from a royal family in Spain . He loved her , so I have been told . She bore him some six children , three of them boys . However , only the second son , William Longsword , lived to manhood . Thus , Taby is second in line after William . His older brother , Hallad , my father , had four children , three daughters and one son , Taby . Unfortunately our mother died when Taby was only a year old . Our sisters , by my father 's first wife , are much older . They are wed to men of high rank and all live in Rouen at my uncle 's palace . Someone betrayed us . One or both of my sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . William Longsword was out of Normandy at the time of our abduction , at the Frankish court in Paris . Also , I trust William . He would no more harm Taby or me than he would harm his own father . He realizes Taby 's importance in the scheme of things . He , too , has a wife , but she has borne him no children as yet and they 've been wed for five years . At least this was true when we were abducted . Perhaps by now he has a son . Perhaps by now Taby is n't so very important . But until we know , Merrik , Taby is very important to Rollo , very important to Normandy . " He said nothing for a very long time . Then , " At least they did n't murder you out of hand . " " No , that is why I believe it must be one of my sisters , or both of them , or their husbands . It would salve their consciences were Taby and I only to be sold as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have won , Merrik . They have n't , unless William LongLORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 229  | sword has died leaving no son , but I have heard naught about it . If there is no direct heir , why , then one of the husbands would become the heir to Rollo . " " That is what you meant when you told me you understood vengeance . " " Aye , I have lived with the thought of it strong and sweet in my mind . Aye , and on my tongue . I can nearly taste it . As long as I 'm alive they have n't won . " " No , they have n't . You have spent the last two years surviving , keeping Taby with you , keeping him alive . " He looked back up the winding path to Malverne , now his farmstead , enclosed within its mighty wooden palisade . He saw smoke rising from the hole in the roof of the longhouse . Then the barley , hay , and rye fields , surrounding the palisade , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Life is not at all what a man expects it to be . I suppose it is better that way . My parents are struck down by a plague , my brother is murdered , the assassin still unknown , and now the child I want as my son is in line to the great Rollo . " He paused a moment , looking down at his brown feet . " It is almost more than I can accept . " " And I am his niece . It is all true , Merrik . " " Aye , I do not doubt you . But I do doubt myself . I went to the slave market in Kiev to find a comely ' female slave for my mother . Instead I found you and Taby . As I told you , you have made my life a confusion . And now I learn you are Rollo 's niece . I am impressed with your lineage . Who you are will convince my people that you could not have murdered Erik . Your blood is too purified , too noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's station . " " You will now return me to Normandy ? With Taby ? " He became very still . He looked down at her , at the shifting expressions on her face , his own face unread-  | able to her . Finally , he said , with no emotion in his voice , his eyes flat , not meeting hers , " If it is your wish . " He watched her scuff the toes of her leather shoes against the pier . They were an old pair belonging to Sarla . He could see a hole along the side of her foot . " Ah , then you do n't wish to wed me now . " " I did n't say that . " " Then what do you want , Merrik ? " He clasped her left hand in his and flattened her palm over his chest , laying his hand over hers . " I wo n't return Taby to your uncle Rollo until I have found out who betrayed you . The danger is still there . To return both you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , doubt it not . I will not take that chance . " " Perhaps , but still , I must go back . I will find out . Uncle Rollo will punish my sisters , if it is they who had us abducted . If it is their husbands , they will be killed . I would protect Taby as would Uncle Rollo . Taby could be the future duke of Normandy , if something happens to my cousin before he breeds an heir . He must go back . My uncle grows no younger . He must train Taby , teach him , just as he did William . " " I had not expected this , " Merrik said slowly , now looking beyond at the distant sheer cliffs , her hand now clasped in his at his side . " I had n't expected you to be an innkeeper 's daughter , however . I just did n't imagine that you would be royalty . I imagine that your Danelaw prince , Askhold , believes you long dead . I imagine he is wed to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He needed a wife to bear him chil-dren . " " What is he like ? " " I do n't know . I never met him , but I heard my sisters talking about him . They said he was thirty and his first LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 231  | wife had died , and she had given him five daughters . He wanted a young girl . He thought I would produce sons for him . Uncle Rollo and the king negotiated the alliance . " " I do not want you for his reasons . You know me . I have saved your life . You have given me your virginity . " " Aye , that is true . " " This prince would n't want you if he knew you were no longer a virgin . That is the way of things . " She could only stare at him . " Aye , you are probably right . " " Surely you had already thought of this before you came to me . You are not stupid , Laren . " A cormorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her face , then gone . She said as she looked after it , " I wanted you , and I did n't want to think about a future that had no more texture than those clouds yon . I wanted to know what it was like , this joining between a man and a woman . You are a beautiful man and you have been more kind to me than not . Aye , I wanted you to show me what it was like . " " You are blunt and it pleases me . I have n't liked the deception between us . No , do n't disagree with me . I understand why you refused to tell me about you and Taby . There was much at stake , too much . You are like the slave who was captured by Rolf the Viking , in your skald 's tale . I will keep my word always , Laren . Do you trust me completely now ? " " Aye , I do . I must , but I 'm afraid , Merrik . " " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just looking down at her hand held in his . He looked down at her silently for a long moment . Then he began to rub his hands rhythmically up and down her arms . " Do you want me to discover if this Prince Askhold still needs a wife ? "  | She stood on her tiptoes and kissed his mouth . He was so surprised he simply did n't move , did n't respond . She smiled up at him . " I would wish him thrice wed , all three of his wives malleable sheep who will give him more children than he can count , more children than a sultan in Miklagard , all of them female . There can be nothing more wondrous than kissing you , Merrik . " " Then you give your loyalty to me ? You will wed me ? " " Aye . " " And if I wish to keep Taby with me , as my son ? " He was testing her , but it was only right . She 'd tested him enough . Now it could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return his birthright to him . He must be trained by Rollo to be the future ruler of Normandy , to be the heir , if something happens to William . You know well , as do I , that death is over your shoulder every moment of every day . The future of Normandy is important . There must be heirs . As for myself , surely what I choose to do is n't all that important . " " It is to me . " He kissed her then , lifting her until her feet dangled above the wooden pier , and drew her close . He kissed her until she was frantic with need , until she was arching against him , pressing and pressing even more . He said even as he laughed against her warm mouth , " Do you promise that once I have meat back on your bones , you will not become fat ? " Her laughter rang out and she kissed his mouth , his nose , his cheek , her hands cupping around his head , her fingers smoothing his thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kisses . " Since I am such a good cook , do you promise your belly wo n't stick out over your belt ? " " I swear it . Now , do not worry about Taby . All will be well , it is my vow to you . " She believed him . He was a man like her uncle ? LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 233  | strong and intelligent , a man of honor , a man to trust , a man to embrace in all ways . She remembered her father , Hallad , the same way , yet he had killed her mother and fled . She flinched at the memory , as she always did . " Do not worry about my people not accepting you . We will find out who killed my brother and all will be well . " And she believed him again . " You are the niece of Duke Rollo , " he said , shaking his head in wonder even as he said the words again . " Aye , but I was also a slave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slave . " " And now I will be a wife , " she said with a good deal of relish . " It is strange , Merrik . But I think it will be enjoyable , with you as my husband . " " Under my tutelage you will make an excellent wife , despite your illustrious blood . Were you unpleasant , Laren , when you were Rollo 's niece ? Were you spoiled and capricious ? Could you have given Letta lessons in pettiness ? " her . " Nay , all my time was spent with Taby , for he was my son as surely as he was my brother . " She wanted to kiss him right now , right here , in the middle of the longhouse , standing near the fire pit , with all his people here , doubtless looking at them , looking , nay , staring , at her , the niece of the mighty Duke Rollo of Normandy . Did they truly believe her ? " Will you continue to be my skald ? " " I brim with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all of them are about you , my lord , and your splendid body and your beautiful eyes . "  | " You once told me that all Vikings looked alike , that we were boring with our fair hair and blue eyes . " " I was wrong . Your eyes are unique , the blue is softer than the blue of a robin 's wing yet as bright as the sundrenched sky in mid-morning , as ? " He clapped his hand over her mouth . " Your skald 's mouth is spewing out nonsense . " He felt her kiss his palm . He drew his hand away , but continued to look at her , wondering for a moment what was in her mind , then he knew , and said , " Stop looking at me that way . Tell me of your father instead . " " I will also tell of your noble heart . " " I will retch if you mention such a thing . " She laughed and shook her head , saying , " It is difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gulleting me with a knife than preparing to leave Malverne . Her father is still looking at me as his skald . He does n't believe me to be Rollo 's niece . What did he say to you , Merrik , when you told him who I was ? " " He laughed , a great belly laugh , and wiped his eyes , and reminded me I was master of Malverne and had no need to weave tales so unbelievable . " " Does he believe you now ? " " He must . Am I not to wed you in two days ? " " I can not wait for them to be gone from here . " " Tomorrow . Now , tell me about your father . " She dipped a wooden spoon into a barrel of mead and poured it into a cup . She handed it to him and watched him drink it down . " You wish me drunk ? " " No , it is just that I would put off the telling . It is painful , you see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lifted her hand . He studied her fingers , the short blunt nails , the red chafed flesh . A slave 's hands , used to endless hard work , his wife 's LORD OF RAVEN 'S PEAK 235  | hands . In two days . He turned and smiled a welcome at Sarla , who looked hesitant to approach them . " Come , sister , and tell my betrothed that you will drink mead with us at our wedding feast . She fears Letta will try to gullet her before she leaves . " " I will drink and dance and sing , Laren . I am pleased . I would have been just as pleased had you not been Rollo 's niece . Now I am not certain how to behave around you . " Laren said nothing . She merely walked to Sarla and wrapped her arms around her . " You are my sister . You have been kind to me since the moment I arrived here , and I was naught but a slave . This is your home . Please , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to tell her so when he looked up to see Taby , rubbing his eyes , wearing a loose tunic that flapped around his feet , standing there yawning and looking around . He saw Merrik and smiled , a big sleepy smile , and made Merrik feel like a king , not just a simple duke . He went down to his haunches and opened his arms . " Taby , come , " he called out . The child ran to him , wrapping his arms around his neck . Merrik nuzzled the child 's cheek , breathed in his child 's sweet scent . He 'd known him for such a short time and now he would lose him again . Laren said to Sarla , " Once we return Taby to Uncle Rollo , Merrik wo n't see him except when we pay them visits . It will hurt him deeply . It hurts him now just to think of being parted from him . " " Aye , but you will have your own children . " Laren stilled . Then she smiled hugely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned at her . " Perhaps it 's time you gave it full consideration . Oh goodness , here comes Letta .
