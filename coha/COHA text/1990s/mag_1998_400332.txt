Marine Campaigns Spotlight Wasteful Fishing Practices // Thirty miles off Cape Cod , Dr. Carl Safina of the National Audubon Society 's Living Oceans Program and pilot Charlie Horton circle desertlike stretches of blue water in a single-engine Super Cub . Their object : to locate schools of bluefin tuna , 500- to 700pound fish that are highly prized by commercial fishermen . As Horton spots a probable bluefin school , he also sees something else : fishermen . In addition to a small air force of fish locator " scout " planes , there are several harpoon boats , rod-and-reel vessels and a net seiner . The boats are alive with crackling electronic devices . The fishermen are using VHF radio reports , thermal sensors , sonar and other gadgetry to tell them exactly where the tuna are . In all , 10 boats had invaded the tuna 's territory , and according to Safina , " The fish had been found out . " Super-efficient and high-tech fishing operations like this have taken their toll on the charismatic megafauna of the deep ocean . Migratory species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are becoming dangerously depleted , and fishermen are reporting smaller and smaller catches of younger and younger fish . The highly competitive fishing industry also disrupts the entire oceanic food chain by indiscriminately catching and discarding billions of very young fish , sea birds , porpoises and other marine animals . New York City 's sumptuous Felidia restaurant would seem an odd location to launch a campaign to save the oceans ' top predators . But last January , marine researchers joined a group ranging from top chefs to food critics and journalists to celebrate the swordfish by not including it on the menu . The " Give Swordfish A Break " campaign was convened by 38 pledge-taking chefs to draw consumer attention to the evocative Atlantic fish , which , according to the National Marine Fisheries Service , could be commercially extinct in 10 years . Nora Pouillon , chef of Washington , D.C 's Nora and Asia Nora , says , " My fish purveyor was starting to offer me smaller and smaller swordfish from the North Atlantic , and I realized that we had already fished out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) reports that the average swordfish caught in the 1960s weighed 266 pounds ; today , they 're lucky to top 90 . The chefs ' campaign , sponsored by SeaWeb and the NRDC , centers on the use of 30- to 40-mile-long monofilament fishing lines that bristle with hundreds of baited hooks . Designed to float at the water depth which swordfish feed , the hooks inadvertently snagged over 40,000 juvenile swordfish last year ( out of a total catch of 100,000 ) , as well as thousands of sharks , endangered sea turtles and other imperiled species . , , s hile vessels are required to discard undersized swordfish and endangered species , most die after hours on these hooks-and are not counted in fishing quotas . " One of the central issues here is the catching of large numbers of fish before they can reproduce , " says NRDC Chief Policy Analyst Lisa Speer . Photograph The " Give Swordfish a Break " campaign is designed to stop the increasing toll in juvenile fish ( inset ) . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's 90 pounds . // It 's these " longlines , " as well as fishing in nursery areas and using indiscriminate gear , that has one coalition-the Ocean Wildlife Campaign ( OWC ) - targeting commercial fishermen . Made up of the NRDC , World Wildlife Fund , National Coalition for Marine Conservation ( NCMC ) and Audubon , the OWC is urging the Fisheries Service to prohibit longline fishing in swordfish nursery areas , limit the size of longlines to 10 miles , count dead discards as part of the allowed quota , and emphasize non-lethal gear like " circle-hooks , " which are less damaging because fish do n't swallow them . Despite the evidence , Nelson Beideman , executive director of the longliners ' Blue Water Fishermen 's Association , emphatically denies that longlines are the cause of the problem . " Atlantic fishermen are not overfishing swordfish , " he says bluntly . " What is happening here is a direct attack against commercial harvesters by the environmental community . The fact is that we 've been reducing our catch of juveniles : ' Beideman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumed annually in the U.S. actually come from " relatively healthy " Pacific stocks . Beideman points a finger at sport fishermen , but Jim Donofrio of the Recreational Fishing Alliance says that accusation is misplaced . " This fishery existed for over 150 years with sustainable gear like rods , reels and harpoons , ' he says . " It was n't until 1963 when longlining was introduced that we saw a rapid decline in not just swordfish , but all our other migratory marine species . The good news , reports Ken Hinman of NCMC , is that if left alone , the swordfish will come back . " If you can take conservation measures that will protect the juveniles and reduce quotas by a sufficient amount , we can have recovery within 10 years . Recovery is possible for these fish . They 're relatively resilient " The swordfish , which can grow to over 1,200 pounds , live for more than 25 years and pierce wooden boat hulls with its saberish bill , is finally getting some muchneeded attention . But the OWC stresses that sharks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discarded overboard as " bycatch . " Each year , says Safina , fishing boats take in " an estimated 27 million metric tons of marine life that , dying or dead , are thrown overboard-a quarter of the whole global catch . " OWC Campaign Manager David Wilmot says , " Some populations of bluefin tuna have plummeted nearly 90 percent since the 1970s , and blue and white marlin have declined 60 to 80 percent . Several shark populations have declined 80 to 90 percent in U.S. waters during the past decade alone . " Another problem is the lucrative market for some fisheries . An adult bluefin tuna may be the most valuable animal , pound for pound , on the planet . Stanford University marine biologist Barbara Block likens catching a bluefin to the risky and high-priced cocaine trade-if delivered to Tokyo 's sashimi market , a single fish can fetch up to $80,000 , and lure fishermen to trail one for weeks . According to Safina , Japan is the largest consumer of bluefins . Most of the population passes through the wet floors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So which seafood is safe to choose at the market ? The World Wildlife Fund , along with the Unilever Corporation ( the largest seafood distributor in Europe ) , has started the Marine Stewardship Council to certify fisheries products which are sustainable , and inform consumers with sealof-approval labeling . SeaWeb Executive Director Vikki Spruill says , " We see this project as a way to get consumers directly involved in the overfishing crisis , and to begin to make food choices based on environmental reasons , not just health ones .
