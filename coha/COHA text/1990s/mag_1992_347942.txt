A GOVERNMENT OF THE LOBBYISTS , BY THE LOBBYists and for the lobbyists has not , alas , yet perished from the earth . But in his campaign , Bill Clinton promised to make it harder for political appointees to step quickly from government work to working the government on behalf of corporations , trade associations and foreign nations . <P> Now Clinton has unveiled his toughened  --  but not too toughened  --  ethics rules . They forbid top appointees to lobby their own agencies for five years after leaving government , extending the present one-year ban . Clinton 's White House staff members would be barred for the same period from lobbying any agency for which they had " substantial personal responsibility . " All appointees must promise never to lobby on behalf of foreign political parties or governments  --  now a common practice that Ross Perot once called " economic treason . " <P> While the guidelines are the strictest ever , they will apply to just 1,100 of the 3,000 appointments Clinton expects to make . Members of his transition team were said to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best job candidates . And you thought government service  --  at a good salary  --  was sufficient reward in itself .
