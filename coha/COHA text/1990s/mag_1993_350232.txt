Repetition is honored as a necessary principle in the music of Bach , the spin of prayer wheels and the effective swinging of a baseball bat over the long season and into the play-offs , but not in the matter of cop-and-crime stories . This is unfair . " You 're reading another one of his ? " the addict 's spouse derides , leaving unspoken the remainder of the gibe ( " rather than learning Italian or visiting the sick and aged " ) . <P> " Just so , O moon , " the addict replies . <P> " But they 're all the same . " <P> " Just so . " And why not ? When the 20th crime fable by a skilled old pro turns up on the library shelf , the heart of the villainy enthusiast knows peace . Brain cells may safely graze . Here , newly old , are four of this season 's best crime novels by writers who 've been around the course a few times : <P> Finnegan 's Week by Joseph Wambaugh ( Morrow ; 348 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , if getting through the workweek without sinking into occupational depression , or into yet another doomed marriage , can be called a caper . Finbar Finnegan is a San Diego cop with three ex-wives and a receding hairline , but only in real life . He hates his job and wants to be an actor , and as this cheerfully silly tale commences , he is mugging into the bathroom mirror , preparing to audition for the part of a contract killer on a TV cop show . <P> But the audition bombs , and Finnegan must go on chasing real-life bad guys , toxic-waste dumpers , into the wilds of Tijuana . A couple of beautiful women detectives assist him in this nonsense , whose seriousness may be judged by Finnegan 's dire judgment that " the watershed event that signaled the collapse of American civilization was the colorization of The Maltese Falcon . " <P> Hard to argue that civilization is in tip-top shape , and Elmore Leonard is n't in the mood to try . In Pronto ( Delacorte ; 265 pages ; $21.95 ) it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a South Florida bookie , has reached what would be retirement age if you retired from the kind of business associations he has made , which you do n't . But he does . He has been skimming the Mob 's share of the take for years , and he has used the boodle to buy a villa in Rapallo , Italy , where he was stationed as a young G.I. during World War II . <P> Why Rapallo ? Because Leonard , who has written 30 crime novels , most of them set in Detroit , now quite understandably wants to write about Rapallo . Maybe even , who knows , write off a trip to Rapallo as a business expense ; nothing wrong with that . <P> Anyway , Arno is pursued ineptly by the Florida Mob and its bumbling parent organization in Italy , and also by his mistress Joyce and a U.S. marshal named Raylan Givens . Arno , who 's 66 , is thinking of trading in Joyce , who 's about 40 , for a younger tootsie , although maybe not , she still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Straight-shooting Raylan is n't really thinking  --  it 's not what he does best  --  but he 's determined to find Arno , save Joyce from peril and foil the evildoers , and by page 256 , it all works out . Always has , in Leonard 's quirky tales ; always will .
