<p> This year , we at SCIENCE NEWS began to cast a wider net to capture readers interested in science . Like many other publications , SCIENCE NEWS now has a site on the World Wide Web of the Internet . Moreover , our writers are relying more and more on the Web for hauling in information for use in news stories . <p> We debated for months about what would be most useful on a Web site . We wanted it both to attract the attention of potential readers and to provide additional services to our many loyal subscribers . Some of the features that have proved most popular  --  among subscribers and non-subscribers alike  --  appear only on SCIENCE NEWS ONLINE . In MathLand , Ivars Peterson takes a freewheeling look at the eccentricities of mathematics and mathematicians . In Food for Thought , Janet Raloff gives a taste of what 's new in the study of food , from the surprising medicinal qualities of chocolate to scrumptious recipes for lampreys . TimeLine gives a snapshot of science history , and Mystery Box offers a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief summaries of all the articles in each week 's SCIENCE NEWS , the full text of three or more stories each week , and a growing , searchable archive of articles that have appeared on the site or have been specifically requested by visitors . Subscribers can click onto reference information about the scientists and publications cited in SCIENCE NEWS articles . <p> SCIENCE NEWS harvests information from the Web as well . To produce an up-to-date weekly , we need speedy access to scientists and their work . Writers obtain information about scientific activities , copies of reports  --  often before publication  --  and graphics that can be quickly downloaded to illustrate stories . <p> Will the Web evolve into the New Media , as Wall Street analysts proclaim , replacing television , newspapers , and other sources of information and entertainment ? Maybe , maybe not . But we are already benefiting from its ability to reduce the obstacles of distance and time to help us carry the news of science to an ever-widening audience . <p> Visit SCIENCE NEWS ONLINE at http : //www.sciencenews.org .
