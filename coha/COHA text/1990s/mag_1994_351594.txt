" Leave him alone . " In plain English those three words sum up the case Bill Clinton 's attorney will soon argue in his effort to defer Paula Jones ' sexual- harassment lawsuit until the President leaves office . The drift of lawyer Robert Bennett 's thinking has been known for some time , but sources familiar with the latest version of his brief , and the impressive appendix of historical writings that supports it , have provided TIME with the details of Bennett 's argument . The key points , which highlight the inextricable connection of political and legal considerations , are these : <P> 1 ) The Jones lawsuit is a case of first impression , meaning that the courts have never before been asked to rule on the essential question : Does presidential immunity extend to conduct allegedly undertaken before a Chief Executive assumes office ? Bennett will assert that the logic applied by the Supreme Court in its 1982 ruling in Nixon v. Fitzgerald should apply here as well . ( After telling Congress that cost overruns on the C-5A transport plane could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management analyst , was fired . President Nixon took responsibility for his dismissal , and Fitzgerald sued Nixon for damages . ) In Fitzgerald , the court held that a President is absolutely and forever safe from lawsuits attacking his official acts . " Because of the singular importance of the President 's duties , " the court said , " diversion of his energies by concern with private lawsuits would raise unique risks to the effective functioning of government . " <P> The decision to seek delay , rather than dismissal , is a political one . " Arguing that Jones ' claim should be thrown out for good would be a public relations disaster , " says a Clinton adviser . " Postponement permits her to go forward later and affirms the principle that the President is not a king , that + nobody is above the law . " <P> 2 ) If Jones proceeds now , Bennett plans to argue , the decision could inspire copycat lawsuits . In Fitzgerald , Chief Justice Warren Burger was worried that uncontrolled litigation , which sometimes is used as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's political opponents to file suits simply to distract him from his duties . After quoting Burger , Bennett 's draft says " one can readily imagine " further claims , " especially involving unwitnessed one-on-one encounters that are exceedingly difficult to disprove . Moreover , given the moral annihilation approach to modern politics , one can easily envision political operatives recruiting putative plaintiffs to embarrass a President . "
