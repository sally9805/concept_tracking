As yet , some Americans may not have figured out what they think of relationships that are " not appropriate , " as President Clinton put it the other night . But most people know what " infidelity " means and what they think about that . According to a TIME/CNN poll of Americans ' sexual attitudes conducted this summer , 86% of respondents believe that adultery when committed by men is " morally wrong . " A statistically indistinguishable 85% of Americans also feel that adultery is morally wrong for women . The significant increase in these numbers since TIME conducted a similar survey in 1977  --  in the so-called jiggle-show era only 76% of Americans thought infidelity was morally wrong  --  should calm those who fear the recent White House scandals have weakened the nation 's virtue . <P> But what may seem clear cut in the abstract can become more complicated in real life . For instance , what exactly is infidelity ? This is a question that in slightly different form  --  How does one define " sexual relations " ?  --  continues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 95% of Americans , which is about as unanimous as we ever get , agree that " having sex with a prostitute " counts . On the other end of the survey 's scale is " casually flirting with someone else , " considered adulterous by a ( hard to live with ? ) minority of 35% . Somewhere in the middle are " having a sexually explicit conversation with someone on the phone " ( 69% define that as cheating ) , " having a sexually explicit conversation on the Internet " ( 67% ) and " holding hands with someone else " ( 44% ) . Perhaps regrettably , the survey 's list of offensive conduct did not include " having some sort of as yet undisclosed physical contact with a person admittedly less than half one 's age . " <P> Of course , a nation 's opinions about adultery may be affected by its familiarity with the practice . America is not yet France , but neither is it Monogamydonia nor Nosleazysexistan . According to the 1994 University of Chicago study titled The Social Organization of Sexuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans ' sexual practices to date ( this is the report that famously announced that Americans are having less sex and with fewer partners than our popular culture would have us believe ) , as many as a quarter of married men may have been unfaithful . This number dovetails intriguingly with the TIME/CNN poll , which found that 23% of married men agree with the statement that " infidelity is an unavoidable part of married life today . " <P> Is this statistical confluence a mere coincidence , a reflection of hard-won marital wisdom or an indication of the sorts of rationalizations relied on by husbands who ca n't deflect blame onto a " politically inspired lawsuit " or an investigation that has " gone on too long " ? The matter awaits further study . The numbers for women are less synchronous : while upwards of 15% of wives may have been unfaithful , according to the Chicago study , 22% agreed with the statement in the TIME/CNN poll that infidelity is unavoidable . Whether this is a function of charity , resignation or some other phenomenon also awaits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
