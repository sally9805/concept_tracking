<p> A new frankness and boldness are transforming the content of advertising . <p> A new vulgarity and tastelessness are transforming the content of advertising . <p> Stop , as they once exclaimed in Certs commercials : You 're both right . Sales pitches for a wide variety of products are indeed being infused with increasingly explicit images and language , which until recently had been considered too daring for conventional advertising . <p> The trend to be rude , crude and sometimes lewd is bringing the American advertising sensibility somewhat closer to the attitudes that have long prevailed in Europe , where consumers are routinely exposed to naked bodies , swearing and obvious sexual situations in brand campaigns . <p> Though Americans are still unlikely to see a bare-breasted woman utter a four-letter word in a commercial , provocative ploys that were once confined to ads for niche products in fringe media  --  baggy jeans advertised in snowboarding magazines aimed at young men , for instance  --  are making their way into the mainstream . <p> The penchant to test the boundaries of taste is just another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they speak and behave to reflect how consumers actually speak and behave . <p> " It 's really about relevancy and consumer empathy , " said Donny Deutsch , chairman and chief executive at Deutsch Inc. in New York , an agency known for work that sometimes challenges the limits of taste , such as a television commercial for Kohler bathroom fixtures that showed a man reading a magazine on the toilet . <p> " Slang , bathroom humor , jokes about sex are all part of life , " Mr. Deutsch said . " Using them says to consumers , ' We understand you , we speak your language , we live in the same world as you . ' " <p> Displaying undraped body parts or using a vernacular term for an illegitimate child is also seen as a method for marketers to capitalize on the recent loosening of strictures in films , television programs , music , greeting cards and other forms of popular culture . Another factor is the increasingly detailed news coverage of sexual topics ranging from the Monica S. Lewinsky matter to the introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , advertising is not something that operates in a vacuum , " said Stuart Ewen , chairman of film and media studies at Hunter College in New York . " It used to be that vulgarity had no place in public culture . Now , we live in a time when if it sells , it 's good . " <p> Some see the increase in foul language , bathroom humor and bawdy imagery as an inevitable result of the evolution of mass communications in American society . <p> " It 's becoming harder and harder " for advertisers to attract attention , said Mark Crispin Miller , professor of media studies at New York University . " A blitzed-out population has become increasingly blase . So there 's an accelerating desperation to make an impression , to stand out . " <p> Others condemn the changes as ploys by advertisers to get noticed in the same manner that children shout dirty words in public to embarrass their parents . Those critics view the trend as evidence of the further coarsening of public discourse . <p> " It 's a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief creative officer at the BBDO New York unit of Omnicom Group , who oversees campaigns for brands like Pepsi-Cola and Visa . <p> " You certainly need to be contemporary and edgy and topical , and even sometimes controversial , " he added . " But it 's not necessary to cross over the line to be in questionable taste . A lot of people find that offensive . So why go there ? " <p> Both sides point to the same examples to bolster their arguments . <p> Backsides are being bared in advertising for underwear , liquor , skin lotion and fitness equipment and are invoked in colloquial expressions about " kicking butt " and other synonyms for rear end . Other body parts , particularly those that differentiate men and women , are being uncovered in photographs or referred to in slang terminology . <p> Bodily functions from passing gas and urination to vomiting and defecation are depicted and alluded to in advertising for shoes , automobiles , software , games  --  even food . <p> Earthy catch phrases or sayings with double meanings are repeated constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cottage cheese coyly asks , referring to calcium . " Zit happens " is a line in an ad for acne medication , " Fit happens " in an ad for boots and " Grease happens " in an ad for spray cleaner . And it has become impossible to count all the variations on such lines as " Size matters " and " . . . or are you just glad to see me ? " <p> Then there is the more daring sexual imagery , extending far beyond traditional realms like fashion and fragrance advertising into such categories as shampoo , beer , video games , cars and resorts . Some ads flaunt signs of arousal , others are festooned with phallic symbols while still others present simulations of sexual intercourse . <p> Though a good deal of this advertising is salacious , in many instances the ads are meant to be playful , elbowing consumers in the ribs with a wink . <p> That was the intent of a campaign last year to promote Bermuda tourism . These ads showed a lovestruck couple enjoying a vacation amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze , golf balls slowly being sunk , tall lighthouses looming over landscapes . <p> " Yes , we would admit it was suggestive , " said Peter Tate , president of the DDB Needham New York unit of Omnicom , the Bermuda agency . <p> Even so , he added : " The aim of the campaign was ' Let yourself go , ' not ' Let it all hang out . ' We meant it to be tongue-in-cheek , trying to overcome the perception of stuffiness Bermuda can have . " <p> Even if advertisers and agencies are only emulating writers , musicians and others who shape popular culture , there are those who declare that Madison Avenue ought to follow a " higher " standard . <p> " Advertising should be permitted to do what is generally being permitted by the culture , " said Diane Cook-Tench , director of the Virginia Commonwealth University Ad Center in Richmond . " But seeing that advertising still ranks low among the respected professions , it would be smart if people in the business thought a little harder and took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the trade publication Advertising Age , said : " The relationship people have with advertising is fundamentally different from their relationship with all other media . In the other media , you 're making a selection of what you watch and read ; there 's some expectation of what you 'll encounter . Advertising , by contrast , comes into your living room absolutely uninvited . There should be a fundamental respect for the people in whose lives you 're intruding . " <p> The inclusion of questionable material in advertising is not new , of course . Milder forms of sexual innuendo have been used in advertising for decades . More recently , many smaller marketers determined that they could overcome consumer ennui  --  as well as the handicap of being outspent by larger competitors  --  by lacing their campaigns with heavier doses of suggestive material . Such efforts to court controversy , which Mr. Garfield decried as " calculatingly taking license to offend and inflame , " have often paid off by drawing news coverage . <p> " A lot of people accuse us of doing that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , an agency that has developed a reputation  --  and won awards  --  for daring campaigns that dance on the edge of propriety . <p> " The best shock in advertising is an unexpected thought , " Mr. DeVito asserted , " a graphic , unexpected image that communicates an idea . " <p> For instance , ads by DeVito/Verdi for Daffy 's , a chain of discount clothing stores , mocked the prices charged by department stores by arranging the sleeves of a shirt so that they made a dismissive gesture that many consider offensive . <p> " There 's a certain responsibility you have , " Mr. DeVito said , " but I 'd rather show a naked person in an ad , if there 's a reason to do so , than create a cigarette ad . Which hurts society more ? " <p> The push to get noticed by performing the advertising equivalent of dropping one 's pants has had larger consequences . <p> " Marginal , fringe advertisers got so much attention , that encouraged the mainstream advertisers to misbehave , " said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What taboo can we break ? ' rather than ' How can we sell product ? ' " <p> Among the blue-chip brands that have recently sponsored one or more ads that in some fashion tested the limits of acceptability are Altoids , Elizabeth Arden , Audi , Bass , Budweiser , Casio , Columbia Sportswear , Grey Poupon , Gucci , Kraft , M &M/; Mars , Miller Lite , Nike and Toyota . <p> Still , not every shock ad succeeds in the marketplace . Consumers " have a litmus test , " said Mr. Deutsch of Deutsch Inc. , to assess whether advertisers have reasons to raise eyebrows . " They ask , ' Are you just trying to shock me or does it make sense ? ' " <p> And the content of advertising has been kept in check by " the sensitivities of the clients , " Mr. Deutsch said , as executives in charge of advertising and marketing for consumer-product companies  --  particularly those selling to mass audiences  --  shy from offending anyone . <p> " When you are a C.E.O . and you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I 'm a customer and your ads are turning me off , ' it affects them , " he added . <p> Mr. DeVito at DeVito/Verdi said clients could overreact to isolated complaints . " Some people are offended by anything , " he said . " It 's ridiculous . They should lighten up a little bit and get a life . " <p> In fact , the DDB Needham New York campaign for Bermuda with the lighthearted double-entendres met with what Mr. Tate , the president of the agency , described as " some negative reaction on the island , particularly on the part of the editor of The Royal Gazette newspaper and people in important religious and social positions , who were uncomfortable with it . " <p> That reaction  --  plus more importantly , Mr. Tate said , the failure of the ads to increase tourist traffic to Bermuda substantially  --  " led us to reconsider " the campaign for 1998 , he added . It has been replaced with a much more straightforward campaign with not a scintilla of sex or suggestiveness . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Tate added . <p> Does that mean that the bold and brassy  --  or the vulgar and tasteless  --  style of advertising is already going out of style ? Yes , and no . <p> " American society tends to pendulum back and forth between periods of relative license and relative authoritarianism , " said Mr. Ewen of Hunter College , " and advertising will always be subject to that . " He predicted the coming of " a cultural terror " that " will drive vulgarity back into a more underground realm . " <p> Mr. Deutsch agreed to some degree , foreseeing " a more proper world , though not puritanical . " He based his belief , he said , on the behavior and attitudes of " kids who today are 12 and 13 , " who have " a pure , wholesome , all-American quality " and would respond to like-minded communication . <p> Mr. DeVito of DeVito/Verdi was more philosophical . <p> " Everything is always changing , " he said .
