Each night when Sandra got in from work , she watched the late movie on TV and ate a cold boiled egg with a Coca-Cola , sometimes with sesame crackers if she remembered to bring a few packets from the restaurant where she had been a hostess for the past two weeks . She had been drifting off to sleep between one and two , and at five o'clock a loud noise somewhere in the building always woke her up briefly and made her visualize a door slamming on her past . That she translated every sensation into metaphor nowadays was perfectly appropriate , she thought happily . <p> She was staying in a rent-free condo . The owner , a lawyer named Clayton Scoville , was white-water rafting on the Zambezi . She had never met him and did n't know what he looked like . There were no photographs in the place , just undistinguished oil reproductions ( a mountain , a waterfall , birds in flight ) . She was n't used to such luxury  --  Mexican-style tile , laminate cabinets , halogen lighting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emerald jungle print on the shower curtains . The lawyer used black bath soap , bright green towels . He subscribed to Outside and Time and Money . A closet was crammed with sporting goods , mostly items that did n't seem to belong here in Atlanta  --  ice skates , skis , ski clothing , a cap with fold-down earflaps lined with fur . She imagined he was a person who could pick up and leave , a person like her . She had arrived with two suitcases and within hours had bought a secondhand Honda Civic that had been repossessed by a finance company . In the trunk were a pair of baggy-style shorts and a matching loud-pink floral shirt  --  size ten , too large for Sandra  --  and a tattered copy of Freaky Deaky . <p> Tonight a fundraising pledge drive on the public television station had delayed the late movie , so Sandra turned on the classic-rock radio station she listened to in the mornings . The Rolling Stones were appearing in Atlanta later in the month , and the station was sponsoring a contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decorate a box , no larger than seven by four by three , to live in for twenty-four hours , in isolation , in a comer of the studio . Sandra had been hearing Stones music all week , and its raunchy urgency made her feel important things were happening in this city . She liked Atlanta  --  its clean , busy beauty . She opened the sliding doors to the sundeck and finished her Coke out there . The deck  --  with a tub of gardenias , a cherry-tomato plant , and a clematis climbing a trellis  --  opened out into a cozy , fenced yard . It was a mild autumn night , and the lights over at the shopping center silhouetted the feathery palm trees outside the nearby T.G.I. Friday 's . The song on the radio spilled out like light into the dim parking lot . <p> Sandra was a sort of undercover agent . She had been hostessing at a Chez Suzanne 's in Texas and had met one of the executives , Andrew Parrell , from the New Orleans corporate headquarters . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired her to seek out irregularities at the Atlanta restaurant in the chain . He even found her the place to stay  --  Clayton Scoville was an old friend of his . So that the Atlanta management would n't suspect , she had to interview for the job , which she got on the spot . Andrew wanted her just to observe , to find out if anything funny was going on . He suspected stealing . She wrote detailed daily reports on staff morale and telephoned Andrew every two or three days . <p> Sandra Rhodes , Girl P.I . It sounded like one of the juvenile mysteries she used to read . It had a nice ring to it . And she 'd earn more money than before  --  even more if she got to switch to cocktailing . Andrew wanted her to stay a month or two , and then he would send her to another restaurant . She did n't mind leaving Texas , a place she did n't really know anyway . It was just the place she landed after college . Most of her college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the Southeast , so she jumped at the chance . <p> " Just be yourself , " Andrew said reassuringly , in response to her uncertainty about moving to a large city . " And do n't get personally involved . " <p> She was herself , for the most part . The lie was the guy she 'd moved here to be near . Andrew said she had to have a cover . So she invented Scott . He was six feet tall , a runner , and had dark hair with a little kink to it . His work had something to do with computers . He traveled the South , coming to Atlanta frequently on jobs that were vague in her mind , but she hit on some realistic touches about him . His mother was a Catholic and his father a Protestant ; they ran a grocery in Ypsilanti , Michigan . Scott had a retarded sister in an institution . He broke his leg once playing football . Sandra had met him at school , where he had a computer-science scholarship that paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , Sandra figured . <p> Sandra , the Spy . So far , she had n't noticed anything unusual . The caramel drops on the meringue dessert ; the food inspectors hanging around a long time one evening , buddy-buddies with the manager ; the waitress who had once worked for the Carter family when Jimmy Carter was in the statehouse . She said , " A cold fish if you ever saw one , " and shivered . <p> Sandra 's hostess smile was efficient and convincing . She had heard that keeping up an act like that made that sort of job among the world 's most stressful , but she did n't mind it . It was like being on automatic pilot . Occasionally , a man tried to slip her a five for a good table . But that was against policy . Tonight she noticed that the ficus tree in the foyer was remarkably dusty and sticky . Its leaves gave off a gummy substance that had dripped to the floor . In the mellow , atmospheric lighting it was hardly noticeable , but her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't noticed in her former job the abstract beige-and-blue decor , the small ways the design varied from that at the sister restaurant . She noticed the supply of maraschino cherries arriving in a stained box that had been taped together ; the colored lights that danced in the outdoor fountain at a slightly different speed from the similar fountain lights at the Texas place ; the bartender 's cold , sad eyes . He had told her he had a daughter in college , a daughter who had frilly hair like hers . He used the word frilly . He meant permed . <p> During the pre-dinner lull , she mentioned the sticky ficus to the head waiter , Wes Simmons , a pleasant fellow who seemed to be on good terms with everyone there . Wes had a silly manner of joking with the staff , but at the same time Sandra detected a genuineness beneath his conventional Southern charm . He was good-looking , in a weird way . <p> " Why do n't they get an artificial tree ? " he said , testing his shoe on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Theresa , a waitress with a modest , outdated punk hairstyle , said , " That tree 's got a case of scale . " She felt the leaves . " You ca n't hardly see them . They 're little bitty brown bugs that make all that sticky stuff . " <p> " What can I do with it ? " said Wes , squinting at the underside of a leaf . " Spray it right here , with all this food ? " <p> " Set it out in the sun for two weeks , " advised Theresa . " And repotting helps . " <p> " You can put it on my sundeck , " said Sandra . <p> " I 'll have to do something , " Wes said . He yawned , then apologized . " I was in line since midnight last night to get Stones tickets and then found out they would n't take Visa ! But this nice lady in line with me offered to let me borrow the cash . Nowadays something like that is so hard to believe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old South . " He lifted his shoe again and examined the sole . <p> " Oh , do you have any extra tickets ? " Sandra asked . She had n't even imagined being able to get tickets . <p> " All I got are spoken for . I wish I could help you out . " <p> " I love the Stones . My sister saw them once in Lexington , but I was too young to go . " <p> " I always said if I could just see the Rolling Stones , I could die happy , " Wes said dreamily . He moved into the dining area and straightened a stack of napkins . Casually he twirled a peach-hued napkin into a fan and thrust it into a wineglass . Sandra had learned that he had an extensive collection of Nova shows on tape and that he used to work for an escort service , but she did n't know what to make of those facts . She wondered if she should have mentioned her sister in Lexington . Maybe she should have made up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered her sundeck for the sick plant . <p> In the employees ' cafeteria later in the evening , Wes plunked his tray down next to Sandra . <p> " Management gives the employees junk food on the assumption that they do n't hire people whose tastes run to croissants and coq au vin , " he said as he squirted ketchup onto his cheeseburger . " Want to go with me to Aunt Pitty Pat 's Restaurant downtown and get some real food ? " <p> " What would my boyfriend say ? " <p> " He 'd say I feed you good , " he said , teasing . " Sorry I ca n't take you to see the Stones . I could take you to Stone Mountain . But I guess that would be a dumb substitute . " <p> " Did you mean what you said  --  that you could die happy if you saw the Rolling Stones ? " <p> " Sometimes I think like that , " he said , embarrassed . " I just ca n't think of anything that would top the Stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecstasy-wise " made Sandra laugh . He was mocking the restaurant manager 's pompous jargon . She liked Wes , but she caught herself , as if there were a child inside her about to slam through a car windshield . What if she fell in love with him ? She suddenly felt as though she were in a movie , but simultaneously watching it , waiting to see what would happen . That evening at a corner table a pair of lovers were celebrating their engagement . They ate everything rich , starting with brandy Alexanders and oysters on the half-shell and finishing with fluted chocolate cups plopped full of peanut-butter mousse . He gave her the ring during the dessert , just as the champagne was poured . Sandra got the impression that the proposal had been a total surprise to the woman . Sandra heard her whine , " But I have to study for my CPA exam . " <p> " When are you going to settle down ? " Sandra 's father wanted to know when she called her parents in Kentucky a little later that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the restrooms and called collect , something her parents still insisted she do . <p> " I 'm not through rambling yet , " she said . " I have n't even been to California . Or Alaska . I want to go to Alaska and roam around the tundra someday . " <p> " It 's cold in Alaska , " he said . " Do you plan to live in an igloo ? " <p> " Funny , Dad . Very funny . " She did n't tell her parents she was working undercover . They watched too much television . <p> Her father said , " I worry about you , honey . Atlanta 's a big city . " <p> " Yes , but it 's really very interesting . Everything 's called Peachtree here . Peachtree Street . Peachtree Plaza . It 's a real peachy place . " <p> " I know I ca n't talk you into getting a handgun , but at least you need a dog . " <p> The thought of a dog struck her deeply , like what journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three years . She did n't mind being alone , and she kept thinking fondly of her suddenly widowed aunt Helen , who had jaunted off to Europe alone when getting a refund on the trip she 'd planned with her husband proved to be problematic . Aunt Helen had the adventure of her life . It occurred to Sandra that she 'd rather have a dog than the ghostly Scott , who was beginning to seem like a creep . The notion of Scott had come to her during the flight to Atlanta , when she had read an article about Japan in an airline magazine . In Japan , there were agencies that rented people out as wedding guests . It was cheaper to rent a person to play an old grandmother than to ship the real one in from the mountains . And people wanted important guests at their weddings , so they rented actors to impersonate public officials . All week Sandra had been thinking about how the Japanese wanted to believe that appearance and reality were the same . Later that evening , she realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him she was going to see Scott that weekend she had momentarily believed it was really true . She drove home from work , imagining Scott as one of those rag-doll dummies frightened women set in their passenger seats to ward off strangers . <p> " Andrew , I do n't have much to report . Agnes went home early with an upset stomach . Frank , the salad man , said his car was being repossessed . One of the busboys flirted with me . " <p> " You 're doing fine , " said Andrew . " It 'll take a while . " <p> " One of the customers insisted he smelled pot in the restroom . " <p> " Write that down . And Just keep your eyes open . It could turn out to be drugs , you know . " <p> " Are you kidding ? You did n't mention that . " Sandra was exasperated with Andrew at times . He assumed too much , and he had such a limited life . All he did besides work was watch Star Trek reruns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stingy with tips and insisted on a first-name basis with Sandra , which made her feel peculiar and wary . She was glad she had n't slept with him those times she went out with him . He was too old , for one thing . <p> " I 'll tell you exactly what to do , and you 'll be fully protected , " he was saying . <p> " I do n't know if I can handle this . " <p> " Do n't worry . You 're doing fine . " <p> " You did n't tell me about this before . " <p> " Just act normal . Nobody knows who you are . " <p> She hung up the phone and sped eggshell fragments down the garbage disposal . She turned on her late movie and double-checked the chain on the door . Andrew was in outer space , she thought . She could n't imagine a serious drug problem at the restaurant . The bar was so relaxed , the clientele upscale , the waiters so correct . She wondered about Boyd and Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Exact Change Lane . Boyd used to work in Texas , and he had chatted with Sandra about how Dallas had changed . Sandra had n't realized it had changed . The only time she was in Dallas there had been a horrible crash on the highway because of the blinding sunset reflections off one of the gold-glass buildings on the outskirts of the city . Boyd and Jim seemed smirky and superior because they played in a band , but Sandra liked most of the people she worked with . She had gone out with some of the staff a few times after work . They were beer drinkers , except for Yvonne , who liked rusty nails because they were sweet . Yvonne had black Diana Ross hair and wore huge amounts of amethyst jewelry . Sandra went out for ice cream with another waitress who confided she was having an affair and her husband did n't suspect . Sandra felt like a rat , reporting the woman 's secret to Andrew , who was n't even interested . Everyone asked Sandra , " How do you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move . <p> She felt she had to find something to justify her being there , but Andrew kept assuring her that the important thing was to keep an open mind . So she reported the times people were tardy ; petty complaints and moods ; the bartender 's mournful commentaries about his wayward daughter . She had to be sharp , notice everything . Every moment should be like this , she thought , surging inside with a sort of lust for something filling and indefinable life . The feeling was a little goofy , she thought , so she did n't tell Andrew . And she did n't report Wes 's jokes , or the way he smiled when he saw her coming toward him as if he were startled by a pleasant memory . She did n't mention the insect bites on his neck  --  he had been camping in Oconee National Forest and been drenched in a storm . Sandra was struck by such a desire to go camping that she found herself digging into the lawyer 's closets for a look at his camping gear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was water-skiing and her bladder fell out . " <p> " Chicken is on all the diets . It must be low in everything . " <p> " I 'm going to get my hide tacked to the wall if I do n't get home early . " <p> " Mom always puts my clothes in the destruct cycle of the dryer and they come out doll clothes . " <p> From a realtors ' convention : " A house like that will never sell except to artsy-fartsy types , so sit on it and they 'll come down in the price . And if the buyers find out the taxes are going to go up upon purchase , they 're going to blow their lid . Do n't tell them if they do n't ask . " <p> " Did you know you can make lip gloss in a microwave ? Mix lipstick with petroleum jelly and zap it on high . " <p> Was there a clue ? Something she was missing ? <p> Her weekends were Mondays and Tuesdays . On Monday , she awoke with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlit sleep . She dreamed about Scott , his image as clear as a long-distance voice on the telephone when one says in surprise , " You sound like you 're in the next room . " Scott had long skinny arms and a face like a terrier , with brown-and-white mottled fur . In the dream it was called pinto fur . She began to wake up . He would have been waiting for her after work Last night , thought , t , working out her story for work after the weekend . While she-was out shopping he would catch up on some of his paperwork  --  on laptop in her living room  --  an then they would go see about getting her a dog . Scott did n't like dogs , though . <p> Now it was ten o'clock , and the radio was yammering away at her . The Rolling Stones update . " Only days away . . . Build a box . . . Your little home away from home . . . Bring it to our studio and be one of three lucky ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is you can not get out for twenty-four hours , so you figure out what luxuries and conveniences you want in your little mini-condo there . Ha ha . Come on , you Georgia peaches out there ! The Steel Wheels tour is rolling into Atlanta pretty real soon ! " The song " Mixed Emotions " drove her awake . She felt something urgent calling her from deep within , like a creature who had fallen into a cistern . <p> The telephone was ringing . <p> " Sandra ? It 's Wes . Did I wake you up ? " <p> " That 's OK . " She fumed down the radio . <p> " Hey , I 've got an extra pair of Stones tickets for you . I promised them to my little cousins , Barb and Jan , but now their mama wo n't let them come all the way from Alabama . They 're twenty-eight apiece , and you can have them at cost . I would n't try to scalp you . " <p> " Oh , I do n't know if Scott can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember Scott so quickly , on the spot . <p> " When can you find out ? " <p> " Oh , I want to go anyway . I 'd love to go . " <p> " What about the other ticket ? " <p> " I 'll buy both of them , " Sandra said quickly . " If he ca n't go , I have an old college friend in Chattanooga . I 'm sure Tina would give anything to go . " <p> " They 're up on the third tier but straight across from the stage . They should be great . " <p> " Thanks , Scott . This is wonderful . " <p> " Scott ? You called me Scott , " Wes said . <p> " Oh , I 'm sorry , Wes . I 'm really sorry . " <p> " Sandra , I know you do n't know me very well but I 've got a feeling about you . " <p> " What 's that ? " She grabbed the edge of her pillow , rubbing the material together . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue chickens . She had n't noticed them before . <p> Wes said , " I guess you think I 'm too forward , but when I moved to Atlanta , I met so many people who were wrapped up in themselves , they could n't bother to be considerate , so I vowed I 'd be friendly and helpful to others like myself who came here from out of town . " <p> " I really appreciate that , Wes . You 've been real nice to me . " <p> " What are you and Scott doing today ? " <p> " Oh , I have to look for an apartment . " Andrew had told her to say she was looking for an apartment , so she would sound permanent . <p> " Well , let me know if I can help you out . And I 'll give you those tickets Wednesday at work . " <p> " Thanks , Wes . Talk to you later . " <p> She threw a chicken-trimmed pillow at the wall , wishing she had invented a different excuse for settling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was there a Betty Ford branch on the East Coast ' <p> At the Humane Society that afternoon , Sandra chose the first dog she saw , a young shepherd-mix . When the dog 's gaze caught her eyes , he seemed to recognize her , and she did n't know how she could reject a dog she had communicated with that way . When she offered him her hand , he sniffed it and backed away shyly . His black-tipped ruff was sensuous and thick , like a heavy rug . Out on the street , pulling at the leash she had brought , he carried his tail in a way that made her think of Mick Jagger prancing across the stage . <p> " Come on , Mick , " she said . " It 's you and me now . " <p> The dog jumped into her car without hesitation . His trust overwhelmed her . She remembered her father telling her about the Judas goat  --  a goat kept at a slaughterhouse to trick sheep into entering the killing room . <p> " I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had n't realized how much she had missed having a dog . <p> She thought Mick would be immense when he was fully grown . He smelled bad . He sat on his haunches in the back seat , drooling on the cushion . When large trucks passed , he jerked his head around and snapped at the window . Sandra drove around the edges of the city , counting the times she saw the word " Peach . " She loved to drive . She realized she was talking excitedly to the dog about things the dog did n't understand . She actually said to him , " Atlanta is the home of Gone With the Wind . " And " Beware of religions that have waterslides "  --  a bumper sticker she saw . <p> He behaved better in the car than in the apartment . He explored restlessly , then hid for two hours under the bed . He ripped up an old copy of Time with the Ayatollah on the cover . He wolfed down anything she offered him  --  kibbles , canned turkey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the dog a chocolate-chip cookie , then remembered something she had read about chocolate being fatal to dogs . She was n't sure . When she got paid she intended to take him to a veterinarian for a checkup , but he seemed healthy . Outside , Mick explored the small yard , digging under a bush and anointing the azaleas . He barked at all the cars entering and leaving the parking lot . Sometimes he seemed to be meditating , sitting upright and motionless with his eyes closed . <p> At midnight Sandra shared a couple of boiled eggs with Mick and they watched Bette Davis in The Great Lie . Sandra wished Wes would call back . She imagined telling him Scott had drowned . Or joined the Air Force . Tumbleweeds of dog hair had drifted up against the baseboards in the hall . She wondered if Clayton Scoville was allergic to dogs . She tried to imagine the lawyer . A handsome , unattached guy rolling recklessly down the Zambezi in a bright yellow raft with a rollicking group of people  --  all pink-checked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gourmet meals prepared for them each evening . He was probably a jerk , she thought . <p> During the night she heard the dog 's toenails on the parquet of the foyer , then heard him scratching at the carpet , probably at the spot he had sniffed persistently since his arrival . His senses were so different from hers , his perceptions total mysteries to her . She could look at the dog and the moisture dotting the sponge of his nose like fresh rain and then feel a kind of ecstasy she had n't felt since high school . In the morning she called her father with the news about the dog . " Now you 're cooking , " he said . <p> At work on Wednesday , Sandra paid Wes fifty-six dollars for the Rolling Stones tickets , even though he protested that she did n't have to buy both of them if she could n't get Scott to go with her . Since she could n't admit to Wes that Scott did n't exist , she insisted that her friend Tina in Chattanooga would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually , she intended to bill Andrew for Scott 's ticket . It was only fair , she thought . <p> During the evening she observed Wes 's calm efficiency while directing the waiters , checking on supplies , absently stroking the sticky ficus as he made friendly small talk with the clientele . She saw him standing by the dish station in sleep conversation with Theresa , who always hopped in a cab as soon as she was out of uniform , anxious to get home to her kids . Theresa 's teenage boy had to appear in juvenile court on a shoplifting charge , and Wes listened sympathetically , his hand cupping her cheek lightly . sometimes Sandra thought Wes was a slick operator , and sometimes she though he was as innocently sincere as one of those religious fanatics waiting for the Rapture , except chat in his case the Rapture was the Stones concert . Which made it OK , she thought , her heart pounding . <p> As they were closing up later , she impulsively invited him over to meet her dog . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " He wo n't , " she said . <p> He followed her in his car . As she drove , she was aware of his lights in the rearview mirror , as if they were spotlights exposing her life . He whistled in admiration when they entered Sandra 's apartment . " I did n't know you were rich , Sandra . Boy , oh , boy , will you marry me ? " <p> " I could n't afford this place even if I get to switch to cocktailing , " she said , laughing . " It 's just temporary  --  a friend of a friend . " <p> The dog was barking . When she let him in through the kitchen , he leaped on her joyously , his nose cool against her cheek and his tail thumping the wall . But when Wes entered the kitchen , Mick backed into a comer , cowering . <p> " He should n't do that , " Wes said , with concern . <p> " He 's kind of shy , " Sandra explained . " He hides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mick a scrap of steak she had brought from the restaurant , but she had to hold the molded-foam carry-out box of scraps high out of his reach . He leaped for it a couple of times , and she set it on top of the refrigerator . He circled the kitchen , his claws scraping the tile . <p> " He 'll control . you if you do n't start training him , " Wes warned . " Giving him that scrap just encouraged his bad behavior . " <p> Sandra bristled at Wes 's schoolteacher tone . " Well , he likes me just fine , " she said , wrapping her arms around the dog . Mick nuzzled her hand and she stroked him gently . <p> " He could turn out to be a fear-biter , " said Wes . <p> " Do you want a Coke or something ? " Sandra said impatiently . " I do n't have any beer and I do n't drink anything hard . " <p> Mick was still jumping on her , so she fed him a bowl of dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating , he growled and eyed Wes . Sandra put Mick outside again when he had finished . <p> " Do you want a boiled egg ? " she said to Wes . <p> " No , thanks . A Coke 's fine . " Wes was studying a bookshelf . <p> " I always have a Coke and a boiled egg after work . I do n't know why . A habit , I guess . " She decided not to eat an egg in front of him . She scattered a bag of nachos into a bowl and set it on the coffee table . <p> " I saw all these books about sports and thought there might be something about dogs , " Wes said . <p> " No , I already looked . The guy who owns this is real outdoorsy , but I do n't think he 's the type to tie himself down with a dog . " <p> To get Wes off the subject of dogs , Sandra played a Stones tape and asked him about his family . They sat in the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circled his Coke glass on its coaster as he talked . He said , " I 'm the middle child of five and the first one in my family ever to go to college . My brother 's at Auburn now . We were n't poor , but we had to budget . Daddy works for the state and Mama works at the J. C. Penney 's at the new mall in my hometown ? They 're better off now than they ever were , but they do n't know how to take it easy . " Wes settled comfortably into the leather and crunched a handful of nachos . He continued , " Mama had a pretty hard time when she was growing up . She always said they were so poor they did n't pay attention . " Wes smiled and dug into the nacho bowl again . " I never knew what she meant , but I guess it was her way of saying they did n't have time for anything but work . When she sent me off to college , there was this look on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and turn my back on her . So now even though I work in a fancy restaurant , I call her and Daddy twice a week . I always send birthday cards and Mother 's Day and Father 's Day cards . I 'll never forget that look on her face . " He smiled . " It 's funny what families go through , how involved it is . " <p> His voice was like cotton , clean and absorbent . Sandra was aware of the dog barking , of the late hour , of the bump of the bass on the song that was playing . Wes kept talking . She did n't know what to say when he paused , signaling her turn at a confidence . She felt her way along slowly , talking vaguely about childhood feelings , her ambitions , her take on Atlanta ( " like one of those World 's Fairs " ) . She admired the way a slight curl on his hairline did n't want to conform to his precise , expensive-looking haircut . She heard a car pull in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Excuse me , I 'd better stop that barking . " Sandra let Mick in carefully , holding his collar . Immediately , he hid behind the corner easy chair . <p> Wes stood up to go . " You know , Sandra , they 're saying at work that you 're a spy from corporate , " he said , facing her . <p> " I do n't know what to say , " she said , fumbling with the glasses and coasters . Heart in proverbial throat , she 'd say to Andrew . <p> " I do n't know if that 's true , and I wo n't ask you , but generally speaking it 's a pretty sad state of affairs when a company ca n't trust its own employees and has to send in outsiders to check up on them . It 's like Russia . " <p> " Not anymore , " she reminded him . She went on , babbling . " I know what you mean . It 's getting hard to know who to trust anymore . People everywhere saying they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time they 're living a bold-faced lie . " <p> " You mean a bald-faced lie . " <p> " I thought it was bold-faced ' Like a headline . " <p> Wes was yawning . He rattled his car keys in the pocket of the blue windbreaker he was wearing . " I did n't mean to hurt your feelings , " he said , turning the doorknob . " Anyway , I think you need to work with that dog a lot . It 'll be a challenge . " <p> " I do need to learn more about dogs , " she said , yawning back at him . She wondered if yawning was contagious with dogs and decided to try it with Mick later . <p> After Wes had gone , Mick paced through the apartment , sniffing . He lifted his leg against the couch where Wes had been sitting , and Sandra screamed at him . <p> " Bad dog ! " she yelled . When she returned from the kitchen with some paper towels , she saw Mick with the lawyer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet . She lunged at the dog , screaming , " Drop that , Mick ! No , Mick ! " <p> Mick ripped an earflap from the hat . When she tried to take it from him he growled possessively . She retrieved the cap , but he kept the earflap . <p> She dropped to the floor and cradled the dog 's head . " OK , Mick , " she said . " It 's time for a heart-to-heart . " <p> Andrew had left the office , but she found him on his car phone . <p> " What do I do now ? I think I blew it . " <p> " Hold tight , " said Andrew . " I may fly you out pretty soon . " <p> " OK . This is too confusing . I 'm ready for a change . " <p> " Good girl " <p> " What about my dog ? " <p> " Why did you get a dog , anyway ? " <p> " Because I wanted a dog . " <p> " What kind of dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good dogs . " <p> " Andrew ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " Do n't say good girl . It sounds like good dog . " <p> " Right . " He paused and she could hear a car horn on his line . <p> " I 've got a car , " she said . " Do I have to fly  --  with the dog ? " <p> " You could drive . Fine . Sandra ? I 'm sorry about this . It 's not your fault . I think word got out somewhere else . But this is part of it , you see . " His voice was exuberant , punctuated with traffic sounds . " You did your job . Now we know somebody 's on the lookout . They 're nervous . Something 's going on . " <p> " Well , I know I did n't let on . They may have seen me scribbling some notes on my break and thought I was taking notes on them . " <p> " Notes ? " <p> " I was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a poem. ? " <p> " Same reason I wanted a dog . " <p> " Funny . OK , Sandra . Get a good night 's sleep . Contact me tomorrow night after work and we 'll decide what to do next . I 'm thinking Birmingham . Either that or Little Rock . " <p> Sandra was thinking the Riviera . Or the Zambezi . She imagined hitting the road with Mick . The dog seemed to like driving , and she saw the two of them adventuring together , a team  --  like the Lone Ranger and Tonto . Lewis and Clark . Harry and Sally ? She could n't remember many adventure duos , but she was sure there were plenty of precedents . She wondered if she should stay in this kind of work , where making friends seemed so risky . It had not occurred to her that there might be something questionable about the job , as Wes had suggested . She had been trying to perform the job she was hired to do , and her parents , after all , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . But they thought that majoring in hotel management meant she could start running a hotel the day after graduation . <p> When she let Mick outside later , he began barking immediately . She grabbed his collar and yelled in his face to stop , but he barked harder . She could n't get him to yawn when she did , either . He whimpered , then pawed the ground in an embarrassed way . A car horn sounded then , and he slammed against the fence , barks flying out of his throat like a water pipe bursting . <p> Before work the next day , Sandra stopped at the public library to get some books on dog care and training . Wes was right about the dog . She had a nut case for a pet . She had left Mick in the yard , barking his head off . She did n't know how high he could leap , or what neighbor might poison him . By next week , she could be far from Atlanta . She would have to mail the books back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen dog books ( obedience , nutrition , canine history , even a guide to the sure-fire way monks train German shepherds ) , Sandra noticed a woman who had made a pallet in the corner by a mop bucket . She was listening to a small radio through earphones . Suddenly Sandra felt the woman 's hand thrust into her face . She saw the broken nails , polished bright orange and chipped . The hand was chapped . Sandra flinched . <p> " Got any spare change ? " the woman was saying . <p> Sandra dug into her purse and found a handful of coins . The woman dropped the money into the side pocket of a tote bag bearing an art museum logo . She was perhaps in her forties , with uncombed shaggy hair and several layers of shirts and vests . Her aqua pants , splotched with brown stains , were stuffed down into shiny red rubber boots . Standing in the comer with her things was one of the library 's newspapers furled around a stick , like a flag waiting for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cloud , " the woman muttered in a thin singsong voice . " It 's all you hear . The Rolling fucking Stones will make more money in one night than my mama made in a lifetime . " <p> " You want a ticket ? " Sandra cried . " I 've got an extra ticket . " She set down her books and plunged her hand into her purse , unzipping the compartment where she had stowed the tickets . <p> The woman laughed sarcastically . " Well , let 's see , I do n't have anything on my social calendar , and I 'm not going on a Caribbean cruise this year . I must have money to bum . " <p> " No , I mean , I 'll give it to you . I 'm not a scalper . I 'll just give it to you . " <p> The woman studied the writing on the ticket , her mouth moving silently , her face expressionless . <p> " Just pretend you won a prize , " Sandra said , backing away and leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ran down the stairway two flights to the exit , pausing to show the library books to a guard . She was confused about what she had done so impulsively . By the time she reached her car , it occurred to her that the woman might just sell the ticket and buy drugs . Sandra tried to imagine who might show up in the seat next to hers . It was like anticipating a blind date . It was an interesting thought  --  one that stopped her for a moment in the act of pointing her key at the ignition . She realized an important fact she had n't mentioned to Andrew . She could n't leave Atlanta until she had seen the Stones . And she would n't . So what if he fired her . <p> At work Wes was painstakingly swabbing the ficus tree with cotton balls soaked in alcohol . " Every damn leaf , " he said proudly . " I came in early to do this and I 'm almost finished . " <p> " The tree looks great , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seemed joyful as he stood back and surveyed the gleaming tree  --  the life he 'd saved . <p> " You seem nervous , " he said . <p> " Really ? Oh , I guess I am . I guess I was n't prepared for the big city , after all . " She told him about the woman in the library . " I gave her my extra ticket . Scott 's not going . " <p> " Good for you , " Wes said as he shifted the tree back into its accustomed spot . He collected the scattered cotton balls and wadded them into the business section of the morning paper . He wiped his hands on his jeans . <p> " Do you want to go eat ? " he asked . " I can knock off . " <p> " We have to be in uniform in half an hour . " <p> " I know this barbecue place near here . It 's just a hole in the wall , but the barbecue is out of this world . They 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull the meat off with tongs and put it on a piece of refrigerator cardboard and they weigh it . It 's your basic meat-and-slaw place , but it 's better than that wimpy French stuff we serve here . " <p> Sandra stared at Wes , enthusiasm running out of him like the bubbly fountain outside , with the atmospheric lights that operated even in the daylight . <p> " It 's my apology , " he said . " I was n't too nice last night . " <p> " That 's OK . " <p> " Let 's go eat and I wo n't say a word about your dog  --  or your boyfriend . " <p> " I got some dog books , " she said . <p> On the way out to the parking lot , Sandra said , " What in the world is refrigerator cardboard ? " <p> Wes was giving some answer , an effusive description that she half heard , intending to store it and savor it later . People were getting off work , and the sidewalks were filled with similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flock of birds swirling together . Her eyes zeroed in on the only spot of brilliant color in the scene  --  a woman 's yellow basketball shoes , the color rising and falling , boats chopping at the gray waves . <p> <p> By Bobbie Ann Mason <p>
