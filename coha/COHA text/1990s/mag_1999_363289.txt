A smile is just a smile , " the song goes , but with polls showing Governor George W. Bush falling behind in the New Hampshire primary , and after two underwhelming debate performances , the smile with enough wattage to light the national Christmas tree has devolved into the Smirk . It is actually a full-body tic : a pressing together of the upturned lips with a shrug of the shoulders and a preening tilt of the head that signals the Governor is awfully pleased with himself . <P> For a while , Bush 's facial expression was chronicled only in print . The Wall Street Journal wrote about Bush frozen in a grin as a counselor at a Christian pregnancy center told the sad tale of her secret abortion . Earlier , Tucker Carlson of Talk magazine described the smirk Bush wore as he mimicked convicted murderer turned Christian Karla Faye Tucker begging , " Please do n't kill me , " something she never actually did . <P> The smirk is much more harmful now that it 's been captured on tape . ( Imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing his cool . ) The most telling moment in last Monday 's debate grew out of Bush 's earlier assertion that he was reading a biography of Dean Acheson . You might have thought he would then take the time to skim the dust jacket , at least . When CNN 's Judy Woodruff asked what he had learned from Acheson , Bush neither placed the former Secretary of State in an Administration or with a policy , but blithely clutched at rote nostrums about " the incredible freedoms we understand in the great land called America . " <P> And then he smirked , a reaction that is actually the polar opposite of the deer-in-the-headlight look that overcame Dan Quayle when he realized he 'd exposed his ignorance . No matter how remote Bush 's answer to the question at hand , he thinks he 's pulled the wool over the teacher 's eyes , that with his innate smarts and abundant charm , he will not flunk History 101 . After all , it 's been arranged . He 's going to be President . <P> The smirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush from feeling inadequate . He seems undisturbed that he has no opinion on Boris Yeltsin 's chosen successor , but " will if I 'm President " ; that he does n't know much about controlling nuclear arms but will hire people " who know a heck of a lot more about the subject than I do " ; or that he spouts gobbledygook ( " It is not only the life of the unborn ... it is the life of the living " ) . <P> Message : I 'm winging it . This may satisfy Bush , but other people have grown concerned . After he grinned through his recent foreign-policy speech , callers to C-Span spent more time weighing in on " the alleged smirk , " as Brian Lamb put it , than on his hard line on China . Last week a New Hampshire voter asked Bush , gingerly , if he were " intellectually curious . " It 's always better , Bush replied , to " be underestimated . " <P> Well , no problem there . At Haley Barbour 's Christmas open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was an admission that Bush 's lackluster performances had raised the bar for subsequent debates ( which he would clear ) , a concession that New Hampshire may go to McCain , and an acknowledgment of the smirk only to the extent that it would be gone by the time voters pay attention .
