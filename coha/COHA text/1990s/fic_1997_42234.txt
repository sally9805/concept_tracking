Every year , a doll with golden curls , satin wings , and a halo stands in a place of honor beside our treebringing back the most unforgettable Christmas of my life , nearly half a century ago <p> It 's our tradition : two weeks before Christmas , I climb to the high shelf in the storage room and fetch down a big cardboard box secured with tape . CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS-SENTIMENTAL , it reads in black marker across the top . I dust it off , handling it carefully , and deliver it to my wife , Linda . She does all the decorating at our house because I long ago proved to be much too clumsy to deal with the delicate items involved at Christmas . After I 've hauled in the tree and erected it , Linda opens the box and begins lifting out the contents : thick red ribbons from a wreath she made our first Christmas together ; a handful of glass ornaments ; a small box containing a construction-paper chain of angels , snowmen , and reindeer that our son , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 6 ; and a handcarved creche , an heirloom from Linda 's grandmother . Finally , she digs into the tissue paper in the bottom of the box and removes a doll , nearly three feet tall , with pink skin , golden curls , and huge blue eyes , dressed in a flowing white gown , yellowed with age . Attached to the back of the gown are wire wings covered in a sheer white fabric and edged with sequins . Another wire connected to a hook beneath the blond curls holds a halo above the doll 's head . It 's my job to put the halo in place , and I usually cock it at a rakish angle . After Linda has finished her decorating , I put the angel doll in her place of honor beside the tree-a tangible memory of an unforgettable Christmas nearly half a century ago . I WAS 10 THAT YEAR , AND NEVER BEFORE HAD CHRISTS COME so slowly . My dream was that it would bring me a bicycle , which my parents had decreed I could not have until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , months past my birthday and still without a bike . I was too worldly by then to buy into the Santa myth , of course , but I kept up the facade for the sake of my two younger brothers . When I was 7 , I had secretly watched my parents spreading presents beneath the tree , and I 'd realized that they 'd had to pay for the gifts that Santa brought . I knew what a strain on the family finances a bicycle would be . My father made only forty-five dollars a week driving a truck for a candy company , and the best that Christmas had ever brought me had been a Hopalong Cassidy cowboy suit with a sixshooter for each hip-far less costly than a bike . But , as I had pointed out to my parents many times , with a bicycle I could get a paper route of my own . Then I could build it up and make ten or twelve dollars a week , big money for a kid in Thomasville , North Carolina , in the early fifties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , anyway . I shared it with my best friend , Whitey Black . His real name was Jimmy , but his fine blond hair was so fair that it appeared almost white ; thus the nickname , plus the fact that we found it immensely funny to call somebody " Whitey " whose last name was Black . Every Tuesday and Thursday , we delivered The Thomasville Tribune to 26 subscribers on the west side of town . The job had not been easy to come by . Competition was fierce . The previous spring , when I was 9 , I 'd started hanging around the press room , hoping to make enough of an impression to land a route by my tenth birthday-the youngest age at which the Tribune would hire . That was how I 'd gotten to know Whitey . He was new to Thomasville . He 'd arrived in town the previous fall with his mother , his younger sister , Sandra , and a man who lived with them but was not his father , I was later to learn . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind their house was a large lumberyard that served one of Thomasville 's big furniture factories . My friends and I often sneaked off to play there , climbing on the huge stacks of oak and cherry boards and jumping from one to another . The man who lived with Whitey 's mother had not remained long . " He drank and he was mean , " Whitey told me later , and said no more . Whitey 's father , I eventually discovered , had died in a car wreck when Whitey was 6 . My first encounter with Whitey had come not long after his mother 's friend had left , and it was an awkward meeting , painful for both of us , something we never mentioned . I belonged to a Cub Scout pack that met in a clubhouse in Billy Barnes 's yard . Billy 's mom was our den mother . She had a sweet smile , kind disposition , and a powerful need to perform good deeds . Each fall she 'd rally us to go door-to-door gathering canned goods , old clothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanksgiving . We delivered these on a Saturday morning in a small caravan of cars driven by Cub Scout fathers . One of our stops that year I was 9 had been Whitey 's house . Whitey 's mother answered Mrs. Barnes 's knock . She seemed surprised , but pleased to find us standing there on the small , sagging porch with our boxes of food and our beaming smiles of goodwill . She was a tall woman , with long hair , deeply set blue eyes , and a look of weariness . As Mrs. Barnes made small talk with her , Whitey 's little sister stood clinging to her mother 's dress . She was 4 then , tiny and frail , with the same pale skin and fair hair as Whitey . Her right leg was shriveled and encased in a heavy steel brace that she propelled forward only with extreme effort . These were the years of the great polio epidemic , and Whitey 's mother had already been forced to face our own parents " greatest fear . " Why hello , sweetheart , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the child hid her face behind her mother 's leg . " Say I 'm Sandy , " " Whitey 's mother prompted . " Ca n't you say hello to the nice lady ? " But the girl only buried her face deeper into her mother 's skirt . " She 's shy . Are n't you , honey ? " Whitey 's mother said apologetically . For a moment , we all stood awkwardly on the porch . Then Whitey 's mother said , " Wo n't y'all come in ? " " We 've got to be going , " Mrs. Barnes quickly responded . " We 've got other stops to make . We just wanted to wish you a happy Thanksgiving . " " Well , that 's so nice . " Whitey 's mother turned then and called inside the house , " Jimmy , come and help these good people . " Whitey had come with obvious reluctance , clearly embarrassed , his gaze never rising from the floor . " Look at all the nice things they 've brought us , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jimmy . " He stepped out and snatched the box of food from me , turned abruptly , and disappeared inside . His shame and resentment were apparent . I knew instantly that if I ever felt the urge to commit charity again , it would be from a distanceand anonymously . After that first encounter , I occasionally saw Whitey from afar , at school , where I was in the fourth grade . He was only a few months younger than I , but he was a grade behind me , and we had no other opportunity to meet until the spring , when we both began going to the Tribune on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons . Although , even then , we avoided each other , never speaking . The circulation manager of the Tribune was once a paperboy himself . He would sometimes pay a quarter to boys who helped put inserts into the fat Thursday papers , and there was never a shortage of eager volunteers . One day , he picked Whitey and me , and we found ourselves working side by side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another carrier , an older boy who was always causing trouble , reached across my back and gave Whitey a sharp jab on his shoulder , then returned innocently to his work . Whitey turned on me angrily . " Do n't do that again , " he said . " I did n't do anything , " I protested . " Keep " em moving , boys , " called the circulation manager . " No time for squabbling . " Just as we were getting back into the rhythm of the work , the mischievous carrier gave Whitey another jab , this one throwing him off balance . The next thing I knew , Whitey was on top of me , and we were grappling on the floor . <p> Suddenly , strong hands grabbed each of us by a shoulder and yanked us apart . " No fighting here ! " the circulation manager roared . " He started it , " Whitey said . " I did not ! " " He hit me , " Whitey said . " I did n't either , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed , and the manager shot a stern glance in his direction . " Hey , do n't look at me , " the older boy said , holding up his hands . " I do n't know nothing about it . " " We 're not going to have any rowdy stuff around here , " the manager proclaimed . " Now , I want you two to apologize to each other . " Neither Whitey nor I said anything . " Go ahead , " the man said , forcefully enough to make it an order . " I 'm sorry , " we both mumbled . " Now , shake hands . " We reached out tentatively for a brief grasp . " That 's better , " he said . " Now let me tell you something ... " I braced myself for a lecture , certain that my dream of a paper route had just vanished . Instead , I heard : " I 'm going to have a route opening next week , and if you two think you can get along , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that ? " At first , I could hardly believe my ears , but I heard Whitey mutter , " I can get along with him . " I quickly agreed . " Me too " And we did get along . The next week we started our route , carrying our papers in big canvas bags draped from our shoulders . We walked together to the start of the route and waited for each other at the end , sometimes stopping at Noah Ledford 's store on the way home to buy penny candies . By summer , we had become close friends , spending as much time together as we could . We caught minnows and crawfish in the big creek , made slingshots and fired small stones at bottles , played baseball , and camped out in pup tents . Whitey did not get to play as often as my other friends and I did , however . His mother usually had things for him to do at home . Or he kept company with his little sister , who was often sick and had no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was embarrassed , I later realized , by the furnishings and his mother 's lackadaisical housekeeping . He did n't want anybody to discover that his family survived on handouts and monthly checks from social service agencies . But as we grew closer , I began to stop by occasionally . Eventually , I was invited inside . Whitey had his own room , where he kept his few prized possessions : his baseball glove , two model airplanes , a small collection of lead soldiers , and a few comic books . His sister slept in a room with their mother . Hanging above her small cot in the corner was a picture , cut from a calendar , of an angel standing guard over a circle of children . Sandy , I soon discovcred , was fascinated with angels . Her favorite book was The Littlest Angel , and she had her own copy . A Sunday school class had brought it in a box of gifts and food the previous Christmas . " She knows it by heart , " Whitey told me , " but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One Thursday just before school was to resume after summer vacation , Whitey and I finished our route early and hurried to his house to pick up his glove so that we could join a baseball game that still lacked a few players . When Whitey asked permission , I could tell that his mother was not pleased . " You have n't spent any time with your sister today , " she said . " Jimmy , read to me for a little before you go , " Sandy pleaded . " Can I go after I read ? " Jimmy asked his mother , casting a glance at me that begged forbearance . His mother agreed , and Sandy 's face erupted in a smile . She fetched The Littlest Angel and nestled close to her brother on the sagging sofa as he opened the book . " The angel in the story is the same age as me , ai n't he , Jimmy ? " she asked . Jimmy nodded . " And he has freckles just like yours too , " he added . She giggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out loud when his halo , which kept drooping , fell off completely and rolled down one of Heaven 's golden streets . " He 's funny , " she said . When Whitey got to the part where a child was to he born in Bethlehem , and all the angels were vying to find the finest gifts to bestow upon Him , Sandy interrupted . " What would you give Him , Jimmy ? " Whitey paused , thinking . " I do n't know . My baseball glove , I guess . What would you give ? " " My book , " she said without hesitation . Whitey continued reading about how the Lord chose the humble treasures from the littlest angel-a dried butterfly , the shell of a robin 's egg , and two smooth pebbles-over all the others . " Jimmy , will I be an angel ? " Sandy asked as he was closing the book . " You already are , " he said , leaning over to kiss her forehead . Her face could have brightened the darkest sky . THOMASVILLE USHERED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that always featured Miss America ( do n't ask me how my little town managed that ) and ended with Santa Claus sitting high in a little red sleigh pulled by eight papier-mache reindeer . This year , the Santa float was towed by a new tractor from the Ford dealership , driven by a dour man with a cigarette dangling from his lips . Santa tossed halls of hard candies wrapped in cellophane to children along the way . He was trailed by a police car with its dome light flashing and a gang of boys scrambling for the goodies . Whitey and I both ended up with our pockets stuffed . I loved the Christmas season better than any other . I could n't get enough of the festive lights , the wreaths and candy canes that draped every lamppost in town , the animated scenes in the windows at Belk 's Department Store , and the sugar cookies at Tasty Bakery . There was excitement in the air , especially on Saturdays when the stores filled with shoppers and carols played everywhere . I had already decided what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fishing tackle box ; for my mother , a bottle of Evening in Paris perfume ; for my brother , Larry , who was two and half years younger than I , a football ; for my baby brother , Phil , who was just 18 months old , a toy dump truck . Whitey was with me when I exhausted all of my savings on the gifts . " What are you getting for Sandy ? " I asked him . " I do n't know , " he said . " She wants an angel doll , but I ca n't find one . " In the following days , Whitey and I prowled every store in Thomasville searching for an angel doll . We found angel figurines , ornaments , cheap prints , liut no angel doll . And no clerk in any store could recall ever seeing one . We could n't even find one in the Sears , Roebuck and Co. catalog . Still , Whitey remained determined . One way or another , he vowed , he would get Sandy an angel doll . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Whitey and I were on our way to the Tribune to pick up our papers when he suddenly stopped in front of Ii McClellan 's Five &; Dime , staring at the display . When I looked to see what had grabbed his attention , I saw the angel doll for the first time-but she was n't an angel then . She was standing amid a group of dolls , the biggest and prettiest of the bunch , wearing a frilly pink dress , two pink ribbons in her hair , and pink fringed socks with white shoes . A small pink and white purse was fastened to one wrist . " Could somebody take a regular doll and make it into an angel ? " Whitey asked . " I bet Billy Barnes 's mom could , " I told him . " She 's got an electric sewing machine and she makes all kinds of things . " That planted the seed in Whitey 's mind , and it blossomed immediately . By the time we got to the Tribune office , he had decided that we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route . And that we did . In an excited voice , Whitey explained everything to her , then stood waiting anxiously for an answer . Billy 's mom thought about it , then finally said , " I do n't see why we could n't do it . I probably could fashion the wings and halo from wire . I 've got some material here that would be fine for the gown , and for covering the wings too . I 'd just need to get some sequins or something to pretty it up . " " What would you charge ? " Whitey asked . " Why , honey , I would n't charge a thing in the world . " " I want to pay , " Whitey put in quickly and firmly . " Okay ... well , we can work that out . " Mrs. Barnes thought that it might be better if she looked at the doll before Whitey bought it , just to see what problems she might encounter . She said that she could do it the next morning while we were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as school was out , Whitey and I headed for Billy 's house . Mrs. Barnes must have seen us coming , for she greeted us at the door . " Did you get to see the doll ? " Whitey asked . " I sure did , honey , " she said , " and she 's going to make a beautiful angel . " I 'd never seen Whitey so happy . He wanted to go right then to buy the doll , but he did n't have his money with him , and we both still had subscribers on our route from whom we needed to collect . The stores downtown were staying open now until nine o'clock on Friday and Saturday nights , so we had plenty of time . Since we were closer to Whitey 's house than to our paper route , we decided to go first to get his money , then collect from our customers before going to buy the doll . Whitey 's mother was in a foul mood We both sensed it as we entered the house and headed for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she called from a chair close to the kerosene heater where she was reading a magazine . We both stopped , and Whitey turned to face her . " I 've got to go to my room for a minute , " he told her . " Then we 've got to go finish collecting from our route . And I 've got a few other things I need to do . " " Well , I 've got things I need for you to be doing here , " she said . " Mama , I 've got to do this , " he told her with an edge to his voice . " I can do whatever you want me to do later . " Nothing more was said , and we continued to his room and closed the door . He made me stand facing the door with my eyes closed while he got his money from its hiding place . I heard him rustling about before he said , " Okay , you can turn around now . " His money was in an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted it : seven worn dollar bills , four half dollars , six quarters , and assorted dimes , nickels , and pennies-$12.95 in all . The doll was $8.99 . With tax , it would be $9.18 . Whitey rolled the bills tightly , wrapped them with a rubber band , and stuck them in his jacket pocket . He poured the change into a pocket of his jeans . " You could at least speak to your sister , " his mother said when we emerged from the room . I waited outside while Whitey went to see Sandy . " She 's sick again , " he told me when he came out . We split up when we got to our route so that we could make our collections more quickly , agreeing to meet later to go to McClellan 's to buy the doll . Whitey did n't have as many customers to collect from as I did , but when I got to our meeting spot with an extra 70 cents in tips jangling in my pocket , he was n't there . A half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sun was beginning to set , and I was growing concerned . After another 15 minutes , I set out in search of him . A block away , I saw him coming around the corner-and I saw the frantic look on his face . " What 's the matter ? " I asked . " I lost my money , " he said . At first , the words did n't register . " What money ? " " The dollar bills I put in my jacket pocket . " He burst into tears . " The money I was going to use to buy the doll . " I had n't seen Whitey cry before , and I did n't know how to react . " Maybe we can find it , " I said . " I already looked , " he said , snuffling , trying to control his emotions . " How did you lose it ? " " I do n't know . It just slipped out of my pocket , I guess . I reached to check on it , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I was just leaving Mrs. Bell 's house . " " Well , that 's where we 've got to start , " I said . " We 'll retrace every step . Come on . " We ran all the way to Mrs. Bell 's house and backtracked from there . Whitey remembered that the money was still in his pocket when he passed Noah Ledford 's store , because he had checked then , so we did n't have to go all the way back to his house . We searched along sidewalks , in yards , in gutters and ditches , under bushes , in street drains , and dead flower beds , all to no avail . " I wo n't be able to get the doll now , " Whitey said . His face was the picture of despair . " Do n't worry , " I told him . " It 'll turn up . We need to go to every house you collected from and ask if anybody found it . " It was after dark when we finished . Nobody had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , all had promised , they 'd hold it for Whitey . " We need a flashlight , " Whitey said . " My daddy has one , " I told him . " We can go get it . " I knew that my mother would be worried because I had n't come home yet , and if I did n't get there soon , she 'd probably have the police looking for me . And , in fact , by the time we got to my house , her worry had blown into a fury . " You could at least have let me know where you were , " she stormed . But when I explained the situation , she softened . We could n't go back out without eating , she insisted , but Whitey did n't want to take the time , so she made pork chop biscuits to send with us while my dad fetched one flashlight from a kitchen drawer and another from his truck . When we came outside , nibbling at our biscuits , my dad had the car cranked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you around , " he said . " The car will give more light . " An hour later , we had made another complete circuit of the route and still had n't found the money . My hands and feet were numb from the cold , my nose red and runny , my cars tingling . " I do n't think you 're going to find it tonight , boys , " my dad told us . " Let 's go on home . You can look again tomorrow . " But Whitey did n't want to go . Unable to dissuade him , we left him with one of my daddy 's flashlights , a dejected figure , trudging along forlornly , thrusting a frail shaft of yellow light-of hope-into the darkness . SATURDAY MORNING , I WAS SITTING AT the dinette table with my brothers , eating a bowl of oatmeal , when we heard a clamor on our front porch . My mother went to see what it was . When she opened the door , I could hear Whitey shouting . " I found it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had continued his search until nearly 10:30 the evening before , then had gone home to a night of worry and fitful sleep . But when he got up and dressed this morning , ready to renew the hunt , he had felt a lump in the back of his jacket . Something was trapped inside the lining . He checked the pocket then and discovered a hole in the back . He worked the lump toward the hole , and out popped the money . " I was toting it back there all the time we were looking for it , " he said with a happy laugh . " Where is it now ? " my mother asked . " Right here , " he said , patting the pocket of his jeans . " You do n't have a hole in that pocket , do you ? " " No , ma'am , " he said with a chuckle . " I checked . " " Well , please do n't lose it again , " she chided . " Do n't Norry , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I finished my breakfast . The stores had just opened for the day , but already the streets were getting crowded . We ran the last few hundred feet to the store dodging the early shoppers , skidding to a halt at the window . Whitey 's face suddenly dropped . " It 's gone , " he said . I trailed behind as he bolted for the door and headed for the toy section in a frantic dash . " Excuse me , " he said in an anxious voice to the woman behind the counter , " there was a big doll in the window the other day , had on a pink dress- " " Yes , " said the woman , " that was the only one we had like it . " " Did somebody buy it ? " Whitey asked , his voice tremulous . " I 'm not sure , " said the woman . " A lady came to look at it yesterday morning , and we took it out of the window for her . I thought she might come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't work last night . I do n't know if she came or not . Somebody else might have bought it . " " Could you look ? " Whitey asked The woman walked the length of the cointer , her head bent in search , before kneeling out of sight . " Oh , here she is , " I heard her say , and when she reappeared , she had the doll in her arms . " I want to buy it , " Whitey said quickly . " She 's expensive , " the woman said , eyeing him appraisingly . " I 've got the money , " Whitey told her , producing the roll of bills . " She sure is a pretty thing , " the woman said as she was wrapping the doll in tissue paper . " Somebody 's going to be awfully happy this Christmas . " " I know she is , " Whitey said . AFTER WHITEY AND I HAD DROPPED OFF the doll with Mrs. Barnes and returned to my house , my dad asked Whitey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , not yet , " Whitey said . " You want to go with us to get one ? " my dad asked . Whitey accepted eagerly , but said he needed to go home first to tell his mother where he was going . We left right after lunch and stopped to pick up Whitey on the way . We drove out into the countryside to a farm owned by relatives who let us cut our tree there every year . We stopped first at the big white house to visit for awhile . Then we piled into the car again and followed a rutted road through a pasture gate to a big field of young cedars that stretched up a hillside to the edge of the woods . There must have been a thousand potential Christmas trees there , and Whitney , my brother Larry , and I ran from one to another , our clothing gathering burrs , as we assessed each tree before making our choices . Larry and I picked a plump cedar nearly seven feet tall , because it had a bird 's nest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinner one . So intoxicated were we by the wondrous fragrance of the trees that we hardly noticed the needle scratches on our hands as we dragged them to the car . After they were loaded into the trunk , we went into the woods and searched for a familiar oak tree ; its upper branches laden with mistletoe . My dad , using his .22 rifle , knocked down a big clump with his first shot . On the way back to the car , we stopped at at grove of holly and loaded our arms with red-berried boughs . Later that afternoon , my dad moved his favorite chair from the living room so he could erect the tree in the front window . It seemed to fill the whole room . My mother got out the decorations and spent the first half hour replacing burned-out bulbs in the strands of lights , then stringing the bright bubbles of color on the tree . After that , we all joined in hanging the ornaments and draping tinsel icicles . It was a vision when we finished , truly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early darkness . " Does n't seem like Christmas until the tree 's up , " my mother observed . NINE DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS , I WAS cutting through Billy Barnes 's yard on my way to school when his mom called to me . She 'd finished the doll the night before . Would I mind telling Whitey ? I did n't see him until after school , and he could n't wait to get to the Barnes 's house . We trotted all the way . Mrs. Barnes brought the doll from her sewing room . " It may be a little trouble for your sister to keep this halo on , " she said , bending the wire slightly to straighten the glittery circle over the doll 's head . " That 's all right , " Whitey said with a smile . Mrs. Barnes held the doll in front of her . " Well , what do you think ? " For a moment , Whitey just stared in awe . Tilen he said , " She 's beautifuI . She looks just like an angel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these wings , " Mrs. Barnes said . " I was afraid that they would pull the gown up in front , and that 's exactly what they did , too , until I put this little hook in the back . " She turned the doll to show the hook at the base of the neck where the wires attached . " The hair hides it , so I do n't think anybody will notice , " she said . " Neither do I , " Whitey agreed . " How much do I owe you ? " " Well , I know a woman who 's a doll collectors and she told me she would buy the outfit this doll was wearing , if you want to sell it , and that would cover the cost , I think . " " Would you mind keeping the doll here until Christmas Eve ? " he asked . " I do n't want Sandy to see her . " " I would n't mind at all , " Mrs. Barnes said . " To tell you the truth , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WAY TO PICKING UP OUR PAPERS the following Tuesday , Whitey told me that Sandy was worse ; the doctor had been to see her . Whitey said he would have to hurry home after he finished his part of the route . I did n't get to talk to him again until two days later , when , looking worried , he told me Sandy still had n't improved . " The doctor said he might have to put her in the hospital , " he said . " But she do n't want to go . " This was collection day , and the paper we were delivering would be the last before Christmas , which would be the coming Tuesday . All the carriers were filled with anticipation about the holiday tips they might get . The prospect even lightened Whitey 's mood . The papers were thick with ads , and we struggled under the weight , but the reward was ample . Three subscribers gave me full-dollar tips-one a shiny , silver dollar . My pocket was heavy with quarters and half dollars . One woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took all the resolve I could muster to keep from ripping into them right then . Already I was scheming about how I could keep them hidden from my brothers . Whitey did well too . He got four onedollar tips , and one beautifully wrapped gift that contained a new pair of gloves and a cap with earflaps lined with rabbit fur . The following day , Friday school let out at noon for the holiday . Stretching ahead of us were 11 blessed days without classroom tedium . Whitey and I went out to finish collecting for our route . I thought we might go prowling the stores afterward , but Whitey could n't tarry . He had to get home and help look after Sandy , he said . I did n't see Whitey all weekend . On Saturday , I rehearsed for the young peopIe 's Christmas pageant at our church . I was a shepherd , abiding my flocks by night , and all I had to do was stand , hold a staff , and behold the Angel of the Lord , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night was well attended and warmly received , and afterward the congregation joined in singing carols , and the preacher and the deacons handed out brown paper bags filled with fruits , nuts , and candies to all the young and elderly . Christmas I 've was my favorite day of all I loved the sweet anticipation it brought . I loved being downtown and joining in the last-minute hustle and cheery goodwill , hearing people calling " Merry Chiristmas " to one another . I spent the afternoon venturing into almost every store-even poking my head into the poolroom , the only spot in town with no sign of Christmias at all . I stared wistfuilly at the television sets in the window at Holton 's Furniture Company . ( TV was new then , and , for us , an unobtainable dream . ) I spent some of my tip money on a few extra little gifts for my family , treated myself to a bag of chocolate-covered peanuts at the dime store and a Cherry Smash at Rexall Drugs , where I whiled away an hour thumbing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evening Post .

Later , back home , Larry and I cajoled until we were allowed to open the presents that had come in the mail from our relatives in Virginia . My total haul for the evening was far from what I had hoped : a sweater , two pairs of socks , a scarf , and a pair of cloth slippers that I never would wear in this life . The only good present was from my grandmother : a book of magic tricks , with a magicians wand . I wanted to try out some of the tricks right away , but my parents insisted that if we were not in bed and asleep in 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panicked Larry . He nearly forgot to put out his annual offering to Santa a peanut butter-and-banana sandwich . I could n't go to sleep , of course . I never could on ( Christmas Eve-did n't want to either . I pretended to sleep long after Larry had dropped off . I was listening intently for any sound that would indicate a bicycle being rolled into the house . I heard my parents talking in the living rooms and later , in their bedroom . Before long , I picked up the sound of my father snoring , but I had heard nothing to indicate that a bicycle might be in my immediate future . Usually , I was pretty good at finding my parents " hiding places , but this year I 'd found nothing . I knew that they could n't hide a bike in the house , of course or in the car trunk , or my dad 's truck . They would have had to stash it at a neighbor 's house , perhaps , or a relative 's . But I had n't heard anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be only one explanation : I was n't getting a bike . I 'd known my parents could n't afford it ; it was too much to expect in the first place . Maybe if I took extra jobs and saved my money , I could buy one for myself by summer , a used one , and fix it up . With such glum thoughts , I drifted off to sleep . " Hey ! Hey , wake up ! " I stirred to darkness and confusion . My brother was punching me It was still the middle of the night . " Come on , " Larry whispered , " get up . Santa 's been . He 's been . " I crawled groggily from bed and followed him to the dark living room . There , in the faint glow from the street light , I saw the silhouette of a bicycle , its kickstand down , its front wheel canted , a basket on the handlebars . I could hardly believe my eyes . Larry was scrambling beneath the tree , making a racket . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called to me , trying to keep his voice low , just as my father 's voice boomed from the bedroom : " You boys get back to bed ! " There was no sleeping the rest of that night , of course , no matter how hard I tried . The few hours remaining before daylight dragged on longer than had all the days before Christmas . By dawn , I was up and dressed and examining my new bike . It was a bright red J.C . Higgins from the Sears , Roebuck and Co. catalog , one of the less expensive bikes available , but , to me , it was a beauty . I had learned to ride more than a year earlier on the bikes of older boys in the neighborhood , but my mother did n't quite believe I could . She stood watching from the porch in her housecoat , as pushed my new bike into the yard and climbed aboard for the first time . " Please , be careful , " she said . Soon I was flying down our street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose run . Never had I known such joy . On my second pass by Billy Barnes 's house , I saw him rolling a new Schwinn Black Phantom out of his front door . The Black Phantom was every boy 's dream , the fanciest bike on the market . But my J.C . Higgins was lighter and faster . I knew I could outrun Billy anytime and soon was proving it . It was mid-morning before Mrs. Barnes waved us down and asked me if I 'd seen Whitey . " He did n't come to get the doll , " she said " I wonder if something is wrong . " In my excitement , I had n't thought about the doll , or about Whitey . I 'd go find out , I told her . I wanted to show him my new hike anyway . I stopped to tell my mother where I was going , and , minutes later , I turned onto Whitey 's street , standing on the pedals . Two cars were parked in front of his house . That was unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother must have company . That surely was why Whitey had n't yet come to get the doll . I climbed off the bike and parked it carefully . I 'd started for the porch when I saw a small figure far down the railroad tracks , walking alone , his head down , and realized it was Whitey . " Hey , Whitey , wait up ! " I called , trotting toward him . He turned , saw me , and stopped . Drawing near , I saw that he looked stricken . His eyes were red and puffy " What 's wrong ? " I asked , surprised , and a little scared . " Sandy died , " he said . His blunt words stunned me . I 'd never faced death before . It simply seemed impossible for it to involve somebody I knew , to invade such a joyous time . " When ? " I asked . " Last night , " he said . " We took her to the hospital , but they could n't do nothing . She told me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said , Look , Jimmy , look ! " But I could n't see nothing . And then , after a little while , she just breathed away . " I did n't know what to say or do . I stood there , feeling helpless . " Her book 's gone , " he said . " I searched all over , but I ca n't find it . I wanted to take it to her at the funeral home , but it 's not in the house anymore . " " I got a bike , " I told him . " You want to ride it ? " I could n't think of anything else to offer . " No , I 'm just going to walk right now . Then I 've got to try to help Mama . She 's not doing too good . " Only then did I realize that I was intruding . " I 'm sorry , " I told him and turned to go . I 'd walked only a short distance back to my bike when he called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doll to somebody who can use it , " he said . " But you better tell her to put them other clothes back on . Nobody else probably would want a dumb ol " angel . " I COULD N'T HAVE IMAGINED WHEN I LEFT WHITEY ON THE railroad tracks that I 'd never see him again . Yet that 's how it turned out . He and his mother departed that afternoon to bury Sandy in South Carolina , from where they had come . Two days later , when I went on my new bike to pick up my papers , the circulation manager told me I would have to take the whole route because Whitey would n't be coming back . It shocked me , but I agreed . With my bike , I finished the job in less time than it took to do half of it before . Somebody must have come to retrieve the belongings that Whitey and his mother had left behind , because their house was emptied sometime early in the new year . If Whitey had been back , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might hear from him somehow-a letter , perhaps-but I never did . I overheard adults saying that Whitey 's mother had left behind so many debts she did n't want anybody to know where she had gone . The next summer , I got a route with the Winston-Salem paper and kept it for five years , even after we 'd moved to a bigger house in another neighborhood , and I 'd gone to work on weekends for Murphy 's Grocery . After high school , I joined the Army and left Thomasville for good . Eventually , I got into the newspaper business , married , and had a son . I became a columnist and , in time , wrote a book . One of my first book signings was at a newsstand in a new shopping center just south of Thomasville . Some relatives showed up , along with a few of my old friends . In the small crowd was a woman whose face I knew I should recognize , but did n't . She smiled when she got to the table and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and I realized then that she was Mrs. Barnes . I stood and hugged her . Billy , she told me , had become a physician and was practicing in Richmond . Her husband had died a few years earlier , and she was alone now . " I 've got something for you , " she told me , after I had signed a book for her and another for Billy . " It 's out in the car . Let me get it . " She returned carrying a big box and placed it on the table . I opened it and saw the angel doll-25 years had passed since she 'd been transformed . " Whitey never came back for it , " Mrs. Barnes said . " I kept thinking that he would , but he never did . I never could find out where they had moved so that I could send it to him . I 've had it all these years . I thought you might want it . " That night I told the story of the angel doll to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then brought it out at Christmas and began the tradition of putting it beside our tree . My son was 10 then , getting his first full-size bike for Christmas . He was a little too old for The Littlest Angel , but I read it to him anyway , along with all the other Christmas stories we 'd always read . Although he 's in his 30s now , I 've read it to him every Christmas Eve since , as well . If he 's ever looked upon it as an ordeal , tolerated for the sake of his foolish and softhearted father , he 's been too decent to make it known . ONE DAY IN MID-DECEMBER , SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE ANGEL doll came to reside at our house , I was in a distant city on assignment for a magazine , having breakfast in a hotel dining room . A young couple seated themselves at a table near mine . With them was a pale , thin girl , perhaps 4 or 5 . I paid no particular attention to them until I noticed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I saw that it was a smaller , but almost perfect replica of the doll I soon would be taking from the storage shelf and placing beside our tree . My gaze was riveted on the doll , and I know the couple must have thought me strange , perhaps even threatening , for I could see them glancing warily my way . Finally , I could suppress my curiosity no longer . I approached their table . " Excuse me , " I said . " I could n't help noticing your little girl 's doll . I was wondering where you got it . " The child smiled shyly , clutching her doll tighter . " This is our daughter , Emily , " the young father said . " She has Ieukemia and is being treated at a nearby children 's hospital . The nurses there gave her the doll . Every child at the hospital got one . " Embarrassed , I thanked him , apologized for intruding , and wished Emily a quick and complete recovery . " Oh , she 'll he fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taking very good care of her . " " The doctors and my guardian angel , " said Emily , holding up the doll for me to see . " She 'll always look after me , wo n't she , Mommy ? " " That 's right , honey , " said her mother . I left the dining room , went straight to the hotel desk and asked directions to the children 's hospital . When I got there , I searched out the pulic relations director and expressed my curiosity about the angel dolls . " Where did they come from ? " " I wish I could tell you , " the woman said , " but we have n't the faintest idea . It 's been going on for years . Somebody sends them every December with instructions to give one to every child . There are always enough . " Later , back in my hotel room , I searched the telephone directory for the name James Black . There were a few , but I realized that even if I found Whitey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to know that he was out there somewhere , that he obviously was doing well , and that he , like I , had learned from our experience so long ago that the gift of Christmas is the gift of love . Now , every year in mid-December , I call the children 's hospital . " Are they there yet ? " I ask . " They 're here , " the public relations director tells me with a laugh . I know then that 's it 's time to get the tree and bring the special box down from the storage shelf . After Linda has finished her work , I place the angel doll beside the tree . And as I do , I offer a little wish . " Merry Christmas , Whitey , old friend , " I say , " and may she ever bring you love .
