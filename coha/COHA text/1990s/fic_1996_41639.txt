At night the wind sometimes woke him as it sliced across the . tin roof of the cabin , and he would open his eyes in darkness to find his hands gripping the bedframe . Thirty-five knots , forty knots-it was impossible not to gauge the speed of the gusts in his mind . He felt , too , the chastened shudder of a hull and the inevitable way his bones prepared themselves for a hard roll to port . The lake was a quarter mile away , beyond two ridges feathered with birch and spruce , yet he could hear her , feel her . The wind might eventually shift to the south , or it might blow itself out . Still , he never again found sleep on those nights-a cruel , honest fact of his body . He lay alert on his thin mattress , boots and slicker hanging so close he could smell them , completing his watch as he must . <p> November . A month of change , a time of vigil . The last of the leaves flared and fell away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the bay like a green sea this time of year , this far north . It happened quickly , without much warning even to him , and he 'd lived on this stretch of the eastern peninsula all of his life except when he 'd been on the lakes , or tramping the Atlantic . He cut wood . He laid in kerosene and dry goods , reorganizing supplies on the shelves of the cold porch until they made sense only to him . He repaired the roof , suffered a bitter night 's rain , repaired the roof again . He visited his sister in town , took her a face cord of mixed hardwood even though she had n't asked for it . He turned back the deer hunters who wandered east from the state forest . He studied the patterns of the crews from the power company as they did their last work of the year in his territory . It was a season of reckoning and recognition , one he liked to mull over . He was old . Preparation was the only rule left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the shore . It was the one aimless routine he allowed himself , and it was far better , he thought , than being part of the union flotsam that washed up on waves of coffee or worse along the gangways of the Soo locks . Those were the men who could n't break their habits , or did n't know they had them to begin with . Not that he avoided every laker he ran into . He did not . He 'd taken his nephews to the locks once or twice , shared some stories with the jaw gang there . And he saw the old pissers in the Indian casinos when he went , former oilers and bosuns and mates exchanging their pension cash for lightweight tokens , their dark deck clothes replaced with golf shirts that made no sense on their bodies . He had little need for their sort of commerce . It was enough to come to the edge of the bay . Sniff at the nearly odorless water , utter the old names that gave character to its waves and the ranging grays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood some miles offshore , her bluffs a charcoal slash of shadow and spume . Often there would be a ship clearing the straits as well , and he would eye her as carefully as he dared , knowing there was a good chance he 'd recognize her , that she 'd been plying her trade when he 'd been scrambling at his . Seven hundred feet long , a thousand feet long , riding high on ballast or filled with grain , phosphates , maybe ore . There was a great deal he could tell from a glance . Yet all he really found himself studying was her silhouette and her motion , knowing she held desperate men . November , and the ice was not here yet , the gales were still howling their chorus to the north . A walk to the rocky , windwhisked shore of the bay . A savored cigarette . The rest of the day for the simpler , bracing tasks he now asked of himself . <p> He had the bulldozer out of the shed the day the boy came . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was how he explained his unreadiness when it needed to be explained . There was a locked gate between his place and the state road two miles west . No one was supposed to bother him except the Sandhursts , who used his track to get to their cottage , and maybe the Mahans , who owned a few acres along the shore to the southeast . Even his brother , Otto , did n't come out here . Too far from town , Otto said . They could talk at the shop if they needed to talk , or at their sister 's . Then the boy appeared , on foot , moving like he knew where he was going and why . He was startled and felt surprise flutter across his face like a dusky wing just before he went spiteful . <p> If the boy said hello , he never heard it . But the boy did stop walking , waiting for a moment on the wet leaves of the path , which allowed him to cut the grind of the bulldozer 's diesel to silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did that-no noise , no heat or vital stink from the engine . The boy was dressed in a red plaid wool coat , jeans , a beaten felt hat , no gloves . He looked warm enough , though he was n't wearing any blaze orange , which made him a damn fool . Dark eyes and skin , flattish nose , wide jaw . Chippewa , maybe , though it was n't a face he recognized . If the boy was poaching , he 'd gotten half-smart and stashed his gun . If he was just wandering , he 'd made a considerable mistake . <p> He laid his crescent wrench in the toolbox bolted behind the seat of the dozer . It was the boy 's place to get nervous and speak . <p> " Came for the beaver : ' The voice was quick and casual , though deep enough to make him believe the boy was older than he looked . <p> " Do n't look like you came ready for much of anything . " He waved at the boy 's empty hands and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any bad stories about him and the lonely way he lived in the woods . He hoped he had . " You should n't be here . " <p> " I got the permission . " The boy swung an arm down the track past the cabin . " Man called from Lansing , having trouble with too many beaver : ' <p> He understood then , enough of it . A portion of Sandhurst 's land had been flooded all spring and summer ; they 'd had a helluva time with the road . He 'd been over there a time or two himself to clear the dammed culverts . Once he 'd spent part of a morning taking potshots at the animals as they swam across their new pond , but he had n't hit anything . Beaver learned fast . He 'd told Sandhurst he 'd trap them out if he wanted . Sandhurst , it looked like , had decided to do it right . Indians had unrestricted rights to trap beaver . The boy was definitely Indian . <p> " You know what you 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm doing . " The boy shrugged his wrists up into the sleeves of his plaid coat . " My uncle said to come out here and look it over . He also said to come to you , let you know . His legs are bad today . " <p> " You walk in from the gate ? " <p> The boy nodded . <p> " Sandhurst plan to send you a key ? " <p> A shrug again like that did n't really matter . The boy lifted one foot , then the other , restless . The boots he wore were too large for him and cracked along the soles . They 'd be wet and awkward in the bogs . <p> " Who 's your uncle ? He know me from somewhere ? " <p> The boy stepped back like he 'd been cut loose by the question . <p> " He did n't say to talk about it : ' A straight look , black-eyed . " Just said to tell you I had the job . If you knew that , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his chest burn in the old way to watch the boy walk off like he did , easy , preoccupied . He 'd be a better man , he thought , if he did n't want to bust everybody like they were on his crew . Yet it was the truth that he sometimes lost his taste for people for weeks at a time . It always came back to him , a doglike understanding of companionship . But as warm and viscous as the feeling was on its return , this desire to tolerate others , to congregate with them , it remained fickle within him . It made him a disappointment , too-he knew that-but he had n't decided to live any other way . <p> The boy 's face came back to him when the day was done . He had n't left by the road , choosing to hack through the undergrowth instead , or to follow the rocky hip of the lake . That was how he imagined it , anyway-the boy 's evasion . But as he fried his potatoes and onions in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes came back to him . The boy reminded him a little of Henderson , that was the only connection he could make . Henderson was an Indian , too , from somewhere up in New York state , and he 'd been a cook on the Pontiac for a while . Reasonable cook , reasonable man . Not much remarkable about him , though he never ran short of coffee , ever , which was a good trait in a galley man . Most of his people walked steel in Pittsburgh or New York City , that 's what he said , but he 'd signed onto a freighter out of Buffalo after his stint in the Army and never looked back . Henderson told some good stories , as most cooks did-he remembered that . The man kept his hair braided , he told stories while he worked both messes , officers ' and crew 's , he stayed out of people 's business . It was funny he even recalled Henderson ; he 'd worked with hundreds of men on a long line of ships . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been , running coal up the dark spine of Lake Erie , her every inch , he remembered , stinking of black dust and hurry . Henderson had never been able to cook a meal that did n't taste of it . <p> Later , when he was on his bunk with the radio turned low , a hockey game from endless Canada , he believed Henderson had n't been on the Pontiac at all . It had been the bad luck McCurdy . Memories lagged and heeled , and he understood he 'd hoped to fool himself . Yet even as he closed his eyes , he found he could clarify little more than the smell of burnt anthracite and onion . Henderson would have laughed to hear it . No ship 's cook he knew had ever been so bad he ruined onions . <p> He turned off the radio and lay square on the bunk . It seemed as though he ought to prepare himself for something that was as yet out of sight , beyond guessing . The thing he called his storm sense was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skull . A low pressure system , maybe . Illness . Maybe ghosts . He 'd have to bide his time before he knew . <p> The snow came . Not enough to plow but enough to blanket the ground , quilt its mineral smells , leave him to feel like his season had begun . Most of the years he 'd sailed on the lakes , they 'd made it into December , the ice of Superior would hold off that long , so he was n't home to see the tatted crystals begin to fringe the bay or to taste the air 's last flavor of earth . He returned to a world already insulated and hard . There were the years he 'd bunked in Toledo , of course . Not so cold there , or easy . That was when he 'd been married , had a house , aimed to study his way off deck and onto the bridge , a foolishness he 'd undertaken for Mary and her sad , pleading face , though it had been a good thing in the end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seamen worked as many voyages as they could hustle . Mary believed she wanted him home in that gum-green cottage above the scudding Maumee . So he studied when he could and parlayed his long years aboard into favors . Made himself into a third mate from nothing in the days when such a thing could still be done . Then he lost Mary . <p> He gathered half a sack of Idas from the cold porch and set off down the track , his head soon clear in the still , dry air . He took the apples up on a knoll he knew , one that had the black trickle of a spring at its base . The deer would find the shriveled fruit by sundown . He fed them most of the winter if he could-carrots , apples , acorns-not so he could hunt them , but so he could know they were there and that they would stay there , in his woods , because of him . He had n't taken a buck on his own property in several years . Foolishness , no doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family had owned this land above the bay for more than a hundred years . They 'd logged it , fished it , trapped it , hunted it , tried to sell it to rich people from downstate who did n't stick . Now they held it because it was easy to hold and righteous to claim . He stayed there because his brother and sister did n't care if he did otherwise , and because it was good for him to be planted , safer . It made him pay attention to himself-this place that expected little of him , which needed even less than he gave . The lakes had not been like that . <p> He 'd nearly ruined the memory because he 'd dragged it out so much , the one about how he got his start on water . He 'd been young and crazy and skittish , enraged by his father in all the usual ways . So he hitched rides on mail boats and farm trucks , made his way to Leeland , where there was damn near nothing to do , and lied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. They wanted him on the black gang shoveling coal , but when he convinced them he halfway knew how to navigate and that he 'd skidded his share of logs in his life , they put him on the deck crew instead . It was merciless work , yet he loved it in ways it took him years to understand . Weather and exasperation , water and breakdown-he went at it all . <p> The captain was an arrogant drunk who used his instruments and charts when he felt like it . The mate , soon satisfied that he could n't buffalo the new boy , gave him half of his own job to do , and he lasted at it as long as the Alma L. did . The captain ran her across a bar near the Manitous in a spunky summer storm ; the mean pounding they took there snapped the chain to her rudder . Another vessel answered the captain 's obscene distress call and was able to put a line across Alma 's bow , but it was clear they 'd need to jettison cargo if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into a blind rage when he heard that , calling for barges to take on his pulpwood , then for a breeches buoy rescue , though they were too far from shore for that and no one but the captain himself was old enough to have ever seen such a thing . He helped the mate cut loose a level of logs , but the captain ordered them to stop and struck them both across the face with a leather lanyard . It was the first act of shipboard madness he 'd seen . <p> Since they were n't allowed to rebalance her load , the Alma L. listed starboard and eventually heeled over in the waves . He later heard that she was salvaged and that she and her captain made hell and money in those waters for many years after . He , however , disappeared as quietly as he 'd come , heading south until he found deck passage across Lake Michigan to Wisconsin . He 'd been told that the place he needed to be was Duluth . Freighters reigned both the Iron Range and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within him , even at sixteen , that some men were meant to labor their way toward extremes of their own choosing . <p> He walked until he could n't think about that version of himself anymore , then he turned back . He skirted the thicket of the cedar bog , passed close to a bear 's den he knew about , eyed the empty trees . On his way to the cabin , he saw a speckled scatter of feathers near the splintered stump of a pine and realized that there was a thing he would miss until spring , the shy occupation of the loons on the bay , the full sound of their inhuman laughter . <p> Some days later the boy left him a note on the ground near his door . Set 3 traps , it said . Uncle still sick . The note was written in pencil on a large , silvery square of birch bark . Its letters were careful and upright . The boy had even signed his name . Frank Andrews . When he walked out to the track , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's misfit boots as he labored under the weight of his traps . A stagger coming and going , and that was all . <p> That night he awoke in his chair near the stove only to realize that his deck crew had not run short of paint and primer , that his boiling anxiety about a young wheelman was phantom vapor and heat . He thought about taking a drink . He thought about going beyond solitude toward something dark and squatting entirely . He believed he 'd been talking in his sleep , though to whom he could n't say . <p> His sister , Frieda , liked him to come for Sunday dinner , so he went when he felt like it or guessed she could use a little money or help around the house . Cecil , her husband , was a long-haul trucker who did what he could when he had the time . Frieda had been talking for years now about how good things would be when Cecil finally got a job at the prison . But prison jobs were hard to come by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> Frieda never said much about the money he slipped her when he visited . He told her to consider it rent , since he was living on property that belonged to all three of them . She kept the books for a gift shop in town and made a few things to sell there herself-wood-burnt plaques and Snow Island table runners-but she mostly stayed home with the boys . She 'd take the money from him , her big brother , and thank him for something else , firewood or a door he 'd rehung . They both knew if they stooped to talking about money , they 'd end up discussing the years he 'd traded most of his for liquor . <p> This Sunday they had sauerbraten that Frieda had marinated , and mashed potatoes , and a salad thrown together by the boys . He was in the kitchen smoking the one cigarette his sister allowed ; his nephews were watching football on the TV in the den . Somehow it came about that he told Frieda of the boy 's visit to the beaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few weeks , unless he counted finding a gut-shot doe near the north edge of the bog a piece of news , and Frieda did n't like to hear about things like that . Ravens had led him to the doe , the heavy way they croaked and gathered in the treetops attracting his attention more than usual , and he 'd cut the doe 's throat with his knife , though she was nearly dead , anyway . Frieda would n't want to hear about the ravens , either , or the raucous bald eagles , or the chipmunk which desperately wanted to hibernate on his porch . His sister liked to hear about the human leftovers , snapped saw blades or rusted drag chains , implements that proved the Hansens had broken their backs and spilled their sweat out there in the woods like any other family with an honest history . She also liked him to talk about how things were along the western shallows of the bay where they 'd built teepees of birch saplings and bark when they were children , the three of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that place , she said , how the yellow sun fell off behind the spiked fence of the pines , the way grilling fish smelled , and she would never forget it . She wished Cecil would take the boys there , just pitch a tent and forget about the motorboat for one damn day . But she never suggested he take his nephews instead , as though it would not be the right favor to ask , as though his choice to live the way he did now , just like his choice to sign onto a steamer thirty-some years before , was the wrong combination of impulsiveness and love . <p> " You say his name is Andrews ? " Frieda scraped hard at a crusted pot . " Paula Andrews 's got a son still in school , and I know you know who Paula is . " <p> Frieda did n't bother to turn away from the sink after she spoke , but he understood he was about to be punished . " Chad , " she shouted , " get your butt in here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scuffle before his oldest nephew appeared in the doorway with his forearms folded across his black T-shirt . He felt Chad look at him neutrally , the one houseguest he did n't have to behave for . They 'd had a short conversation at dinner about his Venezuelan tattoo and how much it had hurt , and they 'd talked about the Lake State hockey team . It had been enough for both of them . <p> " Frank Andrews go to school with you ? " <p> " Not no more . Dropped out . " Chad lifted his arms above his head and mimed a jump shot . " Chip kid . You know how it is . " <p> " I know it 's tough for everybody . " Frieda dried her palms on her skirt , looked at him , then away . " Take the garbage out , will you , then go on back and behave . Leave your brother alone . " <p> Chad headed toward where his boots were sprawled on a rug by the door . " His mom 's the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " Frieda snapped . " I better not find out you 've been over there : ' <p> Chad clomped out the door without his coat , and his sister turned on him . " Get what you came for , Johnny ? I could have hooked you up with Paula without feeding you a good dinner . " <p> He spun his glazed coffee mug between his hands . There were lots of Andrewses between here and the Soo . He had n't really thought about the boy belonging to Paula . " I have n't been in there in a long time , " he said . " Not since before I retired . " <p> Frieda sat opposite him at the table . Her fair skin was smooth and pretty , flushed with the anger she 'd stirred up , but still pretty . He was more than ten years older than she was , and there 'd been times he 'd taken care of her as well as any parent could . " I guess I 'd be the first to hear otherwise , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to keep Chad out of there . He takes after Cecil 's side , too slow to stay out of trouble . Not like his uncle . " <p> He listened to her voice , careful and parched with forgiveness . Cecil ought to be around more , he thought , or somebody should . " Paula Andrews just poured the drinks I ordered , " he said . " And it 's all over , anyhow . I do n't have time to drink . " <p> Frieda laughed then , raising her chin and flexing her shoulders just as their father had when things were right with him . " You got time to do nothing but drink , so you give it up like a stubborn bastard . John Hansen , always cutting his own trail . " <p> He stood , the trill of her chuckle running through him . Frieda closed things up between them ; she always had . She flattened her hand as he slipped a fifty-dollar bill from his pocket . " Take the leftovers with you , do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the wood . Chad and C.J. stacked it like you taught them . It 's worked out good . " <p> He drove like he was in a hurry until he reached the blinking yellow light across from the grocery , where he turned toward the water . He drifted past the house of a childhood friend who was on disability from his job with the road commission . Two doors down was the brown , asbestos-shingled bungalow his own family had lived in during a good stretch . The lake was in front of him , broken up by the gaunt reach of a few docks and the frosted cluster of Les Cheneaux Islands . The water here looked black , but common , polished into a series of pathways that led from shelter to shelter . <p> He parked , but it was n't until he was out of the truck , his fingers working at the large horn buttons of his jacket , that he realized he was just up the block from The Chinook . He 'd been thinking about Otto and how he was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fidgeting had driven everything else from his head . Everything except muscle memory . He walked across the damp , deserted street and looked in the storefront window of the bar . Closed until four . Chairs upended on the tables like spindly carcasses . Pool table in the same naked place . There were plastic garlands strung with Christmas lights nailed inside the window frame , though the lights were n't plugged in , and he could see a pall of fine dust on the sprigs of false holly and cedar . There was a tiny creche nestled in cotton wadding on the varnished windowsill as well . Touches of Paula . Sweet . Well-meaning . Incomplete . He reopened the top button of his coat and began to search for his gloves . He 'd lived a piece of his life in The Chinook , fighting , paring down love , filling his core with the false heat of bourbon . Then he 'd moved on . The building felt no different in his mind now than the small dog-brown bungalow hunkered just out of sight on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew Otto would be working , even with the marina shut until spring , because that 's what Otto did . His brother had repainted the building that fall , and he 'd put in double-paned windows and new barn-red awnings . But he had n't changed the name of their father 's business . It was the same . Hansen and Sons . Boat Builders . Docks . Storage . <p> He knocked on the bolted front door , though he had a key to the lock on his own key ring . Otto had never been one for surprises . He waited , then heard a motor fire up just as he was setting his face to meet his brother 's . The engine sounded muted and sluggish in the cold . He stepped around the corner of the shop , across the old launch ramp that was now boarded up , and toward the quay . His brother was casting off in the Chris-Craft , his face a putty-colored mask above his coveralls and the thick , speckled scarf done up for him by his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glazed with ice , and the inlet was curdled with slush . Boxes and bags crowded the floor of the boat behind where Otto stood at the wheel , his movements stiff but sure as he throttled into the channel . He was running groceries to widows and shut-ins out among the islands , stern and charitable with his yellow Labrador braced against his legs , her nose raised in the slapping air . That was his younger brother , as able and Lutheran as they came . He watched Otto take the chill breath of the lake across his face , watched him handle himself as any good wheelman might as his wake spooled and crimped the dark water . Something about the sight made his neck feel bowstrung , but he conquered it . Then he worked his way back to his still warm truck and the narrow , patchy roads to the bay . <p> The boy came when the girl got hurt , and it later seemed to him that the boy , Frank Andrews , had guessed that they 'd be shut up in a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He was patching the wall behind his wood stove with metal cut from a wrecked panel truck because it 's what he had for the job . There 'd been a wet five-inch snow the night before ; he did n't feel like plowing his way toward town . Besides , he liked an ugly repair that called on him to be resourceful . <p> The cabin door was open a crack for fresh air , but the boy knocked on the jamb , anyway . The noise of the knock pivoted him against the stove , crouching . Then he saw it was the boy from the brownish slash of face , the drained color of his hat . " Yeah , " he said , standing with the hammer still in his hand . <p> " It 's Frank Andrews . " The boy laid out each syllable like it was stolen . " Got my beaver , but had a accident with a trap and wondered if you had a bandage . Just till I can get to my car . " <p> He went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock could make a bad thing seem not so bad at first . A man could break an arm in one of those traps . The low , marbled sky was spitting snow which had begun to dust the boy 's sturdy shoulders with flakes . He took in the boy 's eyes first , which were black and even and undeluded by pain , then he saw the sleek carcass of a beaver cast into a pocket drift near a corner of the shack . It was bloodless as it ought to be since the traps were made to drown a beaver and never tear its pelt . It took him a moment to register the girl standing half-shielded by the boy . She was the one who 'd been hurt . One of her hands was cupped beneath the other like a bowl , collecting the run of blood . <p> " Get in here , " he said , " get on in , " and he did n't take time to say what he wanted to say about the cramped way he lived . The blood he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of it . There 'd be more in the heat of the cabin , but if she had n't nicked an artery he supposed he could handle it . Otherwise , it would be compresses and blankets and a damn crazy dozer ride out to the road . Neither kid did anything more than cross the threshold , though the boy reached for the girl 's elbow , as if to offer her rivuleted skin as evidence of some sort of sincerity . " I got a first-aid kit , " he said before either of them could start with an explanation . " Sit her in my chair and lay that hand where I can see it . " <p> Coat and cap off , hands washed , kit opened on the table , which was scoured smooth and clean because he kept it that way . He 'd never served as purser onboard , but he 'd cleaned up his share of sailors after fights or mishaps with winches and snapped lines . He 'd doctored himself plenty , too . He placed a towel under the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown , contracted some with pain and worry , though her cold-flushed mouth flitted with a smile that was part embarrassment , part apology . Indian , too , he decided , though not as full-blooded as the boy . Her hair was pulled off her face and hung down her back in a smooth , water-beaded hank . It was easy for him to see that she was pretty . Of course any son of Paula 's would be used to that , fine looks in a woman , though whether he 'd come to expect it , to search for it , was maybe another matter . He laid his own toughened fingertips at the base of her hand , felt it quiver , yet coaxed her without words to open her fingers . She shivered all over then , and he remembered what little he 'd seen of her when she 'd been standing on his doorstep . She was wet to the waist , soaking wet , like anybody might be who went after beaver dressed in jeans and cheap stay-in-town boots . He nodded to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " Build up the fire , will you ? Or the hypothermia will get to her before I do . " <p> The cut was ragged and ran from the crease of her ring finger across her palm to the fleshy base of her thumb , which accounted for the good amount of blood . Her thawing hands ached and stung ; he could see that , too . And before he thought about it , he was massaging them some with his own , carefully , his skin feeling husklike to him against the raw damp of hers . She was smallboned , trembling . He daubed at her palm with a corner of the towel , then looked into her eyes , which gave him nothing . Without wiping his own fingers clean , he began to irrigate the wound . <p> " I can fix this good enough to get you to the clinic . You going up to the Soo ? " <p> Neither of them answered him at first , though the girl dropped her head so he could see its delicate oval crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Ignace , " the boy said from where he was squatting by the stove . " She 's from there . " <p> " They got a Indian clinic there , somewhere she can get stitches ? " <p> " It 'll get taken care of . " The boy 's voice was harder than it needed to be , and he wondered if they 'd both been scared out there , truly afraid they were up against it , and that was what was holding them in so tight . Then again , maybe he 'd made some kind of mistake . Maybe the girl was n't Indian at all . <p> " Good , " he said . " You take care of it . Because I can sew it up here and now if you 're planning on getting stupid on me , or lazy " <p> The girl flinched so hard her knuckles knocked against the tabletop . The boy , Frank , stood halfway and took on a look that read mad-as-hell , which made him feel solid to see because he knew how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this unprepared for ministering , had brought a floating feeling to his stomach and beneath his words that he did not care for . <p> " Do n't do no more . " The boy moved up against the table again . " She 's all right . Shelley , you all right ? " <p> She nodded and began to push away from the heavy oak table , her hand stained orange with disinfectant but unbandaged , gaping . She seemed caught in the swift stream of the boy 's assurance . Her legs failed her , though , faster than even he 'd foreseen , because they 'd been half-assed , all of them , and had n't stripped her of her wet boots and clothes . She sank toward the chair , faltered , fell against the boy . He caught her under the arms and lifted her as though he 'd cradled her before , then carried her to the bunk without asking . That was fine , though , he thought . It was the right thing to do . <p> " We need to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that his voice had gone solemn and whispery , though the girl was very much awake . " I 've got some clothes . See if she 'll undress . " He went to the place he kept his chest and flipped open the smooth brass latches while they spoke in low voices behind him . Everything in the chest was neatly folded and held the warm , powdery scent of cedar . It was easy to find what he needed . <p> " She wants to dress herself , " the boy said , and the girl , who was sitting upright now on his scarred bunk , swung her head in blank agreement . " You . . . we . . . , " the boy half-coughed , " we make her nervous . Could we leave for a minute , let her take care of it ? " <p> " Yes , " he said , and that was all . He scooped up his cap and coat from the floor where they 'd fallen and headed out the door . He 'd forgotten to expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door behind them , and the clean , diffuse light the snow carried with it made it seem as though they 'd stepped into a white , high-ceilinged room , one just large enough to handle their talk and commotion . He stepped over to the plump carcass of the beaver , knelt next to it . Its dead eyes and yellowed teeth were invisible , buried , yet he thought he could smell the oily , musky taint of panic . <p> " You planning to haul it out yourself ? " The beaver was big , sixty pounds easy . <p> " She 's strong , " the boy said , tilting his head toward the cabin . " That 's why I brung her along . " <p> He laughed until the boy showed his well-spaced teeth , and then it was in him , fast and mean , to give his laugh an ugly twist . A girl like that should n't be out here , though he thought he understood why she 'd come . The boy was rocking on his feet again , rippling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Women would follow the stream of that energy as long as the boy had it , he thought . Follow it and try to drink it down . Before he knew it he 'd reached into his pocket for two cigarettes and a lighter . It amazed him , the way two people could make headway without words . He thought briefly of the girl drying her small , cold-clenched body with his bath towel , the live tinge that would come to her skin , the darkening smears of her blood . Then something about the way the boy handled his cigarette , his whole body sheltering the lighter 's blue-whipped flame , brought a question to mind . " You play some basketball ? " He tapped his own smoke on a thumbnail . " I think my nephew talked about that . " <p> The boy narrowed his eyes as if he were measuring something . He raised one hand , cocked it at the wrist , then flipped it forward . He could see that was all the answer he would get . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though his body remembered the moves , would forever remember them , he 'd stopped tunneling into that game with his mind . <p> " We can stand out here and freeze , then , just standing here . Or we can load that beaver in my truck . " He bent over and scythed the snow off the glossy pelt with the edge of his hand . " I 'll take you out to your car . " <p> The boy squinted at him through a scrim of smoke , then shrugged the way he did . <p> " Check on her first , maybe , " he said . " Make sure she 's using the blankets . " <p> The boy grabbed at his frosted hat and stuck his head back inside the cabin . He could see that the boy 's hair had been cut since he 'd last seen him . It fell in a smooth , blunt line along the flat muscle of his jaw and the coppery nape of his neck . <p> " She 's all right , " the boy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dressing . " <p> They squatted as a pair and shared the beaver 's weight as they lifted . He glanced up the track and made a guess that the Ford would get to the road all right ; it would be a lot easier if they could travel in a heated cab . When the beaver was laid out in the truck bed , he found his fingers spidering through his pockets for more cigarettes . The boy seemed impressed that he had two trucks in the shed , plus the dozer and a good canoe . He wanted to know about the machines , if they all drove well . " Used to know your mother , " he said to the boy instead , and right away the words hung from him like brittle ice from a branch . He felt foolish . The boy probably knew all he wanted to know about old Hermit Hansen . He had no business trying to make himself out to be another kind of man . <p> " Everybody knows my ma . " The boy ran a hand along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the roomy bed . " Everybody from around here , anyway . Long time she 's worked at The Chinook . " <p> " I shot pool in there some , when I was n't shipped out . " <p> " Thought you hardly ever left this place . " The boy blew some air into his hands , kept his eyes on the truck . " Guard it like a damn Doberman or something . " <p> Hearing that strangled the bland words he 'd aligned in his throat , and he stepped out of the shed into a dervish of snow that whirled off the roof . He tried to lock his mind onto the idea of the half-dressed girl , how she needed to be wreathed in warmth , gotten home . <p> " Hey , you want to tell me about my ma , go ahead . " There was swagger in the boy 's words now . " I 've heard it before . One million times . So do n't think you know a story that 'll get to me . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the boy , headed back to where he stood in the shelter of the shed . But he could n't get his head to go all silky like it needed to be before he went into a fight . He could n't even bring Paula 's smooth , silent , commiserating face into focus , her sympathetic neck . He stopped , letting the wind split at his back . <p> " I guess now you 're gon na tell me Ma 's the reason you keep women 's clothes way out here . " The boy had his arms away from his sides , hands flexing . " Do it , then . Come at me with your weird-old-man shit . Cause no woman would ever come here for you . You ca n't tell me that . " <p> It had been a long while since he 'd been where the anger took him , riding roughshod through nerve and vein , howling within him louder than the words in his bitten throat could howl . Yet it came easily enough . He did n't bother to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , clucking and fluttering in outrage . He went straight to the cabin , burst inside with his vision blanched by fury and the ungiving glare of snow . The girl was slumped on his bunk , drowsy maybe , wilted by comfort . He grabbed her where her shoulder met her collarbone , bent on flinging her to her feet , which he did . She gasped , and he felt her warm , shocked , caressing breath but did n't hear it . Did n't hear the boy tear into the cabin , either , though he knew when he was behind him , exactly there , and was able to meet him with a solid punch to the gut when it was time . He flung the girl 's shortwaisted coat after her and her false-furred boots and her wet , crumpled clothes . He flung them both out , into the world where they could keep their messes to themselves . The girl began to cry , but he was deaf to that also . He did see the boy 's face , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brows , the jagged , uncentered glint in the eyes . It meant the boy had been cornered for the first time . That he 'd just about found a new edge to plunge over . <p> He barely heard the bleating curses and the crude battering of his truck as they tore at the tailgate and took their beaver back . They would have stolen the truck if they could have , maybe even wrecked it . It 's what he would have done . He watched them hump up the track with the beaver bowing the boy 's infuriated young body , the girl stumbling along behind . He noticed that the girl had left her soaked garments strewn between the cabin and the shed , and he thought he could either burn them or fold them into his sea chest-that it would n't matter which he did . He saw , too , that she 'd wrapped her hand with the gauze he 'd laid out for her . There was the blankness of a bandage on her , just as there was the resin color of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turtleneck on her slender torso and arms , the musky linger of her sweat . What he did n't know and could n't give a good history to were those vagabond clothes , what she 'd taken from him . He did not recall who they 'd once belonged to or whether he 'd known her name at all . <p> The nights became as long as they ever get , and as stark , and the wave-etched ice shelved itself around the bay and out into the lake until the shipping channels were closed . Snow came in sheets and squalls and perfect geometric drifts . On clear days he hauled wood in the restless company of crows , skidding pallets of poplar and deadfall oak in from the far-off places he 'd stacked them . On days when the sky seemed no higher than the treeline and the smoke from his chimney fumed at his door , he stayed in , flipped cards , listened to the insistent radio . He spent some complicated hours with a T square drawing up plans for a sauna , but he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open a carton of cigarettes and thought about the boy . He had n't been back for his traps . It was no way to run a line , but laziness of that sort was up to the boy and his uncle , if there really was an uncle . He considered how he 'd once connected the boy with Henderson and what a mistake that had been . Henderson had a sense of humor and a bolt-tight sense of himself as a man . Henderson had never thrown anything in another man 's face , which was where the boy 's weakness was , in his impetuous , assuming pride . Good sailors withheld almost all there was to withhold aboard ship-it was how any crew avoided murder-and if a sailor was smart , he behaved much the same way when he had to be on land . Surviving . Two legs to stand on . <p> Henderson on the McCurdy . They 'd been aboard together , hauling a capacity load of taconite out of Duluth , running to make St. Marys River before she froze . On his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of the vessels aheadespecially the empty ones-heaved to in the lee of Keweenaw Point or short of the river , where thick fog was said to be mothering chunk ice and sleet . The John C. McCurdy steamed on . He had little trouble driving her into the black , foaming swells and keeping her trim . At next watch , though , things were different . <p> The old man was on the bridge by then , sleepless , thin-lipped . The wind screeched through the gangways , and the water they took across the bow began to rivet itself into a crystal armor of ice . Radio reports put them on the near side of a full-blown gale . The captain was an able man , overly cautious but never stupid . He ordered a change of course designed to run with wind and current alike . But McCurdy began to wallow under the extra weight of the ice . Two hours later the propeller gave way , unable to take the strain of being pitched into open air , then slammed into the mad roil of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrench and give , and they hated the loss of momentum , the wheezing surge that had been the one force under their control . The captain radioed the Coast Guard and prepared for a merciless wait . <p> A twin-screw freighter from Canada offered to backtrack and give McCurdy a line to keep her off the shoals . But the captain told the freighter to tend to her own needs ; he was nearly far enough east to be safe . And this was how Third Mate Hansen left things when he climbed from the bridge . Square-shouldered men not thinking ahead . Stoic . <p> He came into the officers ' mess dripping and swearing . The air in the galley was stale with breath and sweat and the soggy smell of food no one wanted . He coughed into his hands , tasting the layered man-stink while he exhaled the arctic swipe of the storm . He noticed there was a passenger in the galley , a smallish withered man who was trying to read a magazine . It bothered him that the man was not in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crew that had trouble on its hands , but he said nothing . <p> " Sandwich , " he called to Henderson , and he shed his rain gear behind the chair that was his . Sloppy , irregular , but he did it , anyway . The ship fell off into a trough ; each man braced himself for dive and recovery . Devil 's pride , he told himself , all of them pretending that this cork-tossing was normal . <p> " I got some fish and some ham , " Henderson said , his dark arms crossbarred in the doorway . " Your choice , sir . " <p> That made them both laugh . " Make me four hams to run topside with some coffee . I ca n't stay here . " <p> " Sure you can . No man is that everlasting important . " The words came from the passenger , sudden and taunting . He glanced at Henderson for confirmation of the man 's impertinence , but Henderson had turned to his work , bowed and uninvolved , so he angled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Maybe I do n't care if I 'm important . It 's my job . " <p> " No , it 's not , Mate Hansen . You 've pulled your watch . You were off at twelve bells . " <p> " This is a bad time , sir . " <p> " This , " the man said delightedly , " is what a freshwater sailor would call a bad time . " <p> The old fellow , he decided , was crazy with worry , or simply crazy . He yanked his slicker from the floor while the McCurdy balanced atop yet another wind-shorn crest . He moved into the galley as she paused , looking for a place to steady himself because he did n't like the way she felt , bovine , resigned . The ship plunged hard , then submarined . He found himself pressed next to Henderson in the tight space below the ovens . The Indian showed clenched teeth . The passenger , it sounded like , was flung against a wall . Seconds later the bow pulled free of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd need worse luck to lose her-he knew that-but the captain would want him to ready the boats just the same . <p> Henderson went to help the passenger while he tucked his pockets full of sandwiches and a thermos . He listened as the passenger insisted he was unhurt . " I am fine , " he chided the cook . " You men have been through nothing if you ca n't chin up to this . " Henderson said something inaudible , and the passenger began to cackle , then cough . " I 've been washed ashore bare-arsed twice in my life . You ever sail Torpedo Alley off Cape Hatteras ? Ever hear of the bloody hell called Dunkirk ? " He paused long enough to hear the man 's hollow accent become more British than it had been before . The captain had passed along a name at one pointBurley ? Billingsley ? -a joyrider , the captain said , with plenty of money . He fastened his slicker and made his way to the corner , where Henderson had propped the man upright . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He leaned into the yellowish , translucent face that up close seemed shrunken by illness . He had n't seen that before , or the blood dribbling from a split lip , and he felt pity mix with frustration in his gut , a blend he did n't like . " If that 's what you 're after , I 'll make it my business to see you do n't get it . Not on this ship : ' <p> " You do n't give the orders . " The man bared his pinkened teeth for a laugh . <p> He grabbed the man 's throat , sank his fingers into slack , wattled flesh , and shoved until the galley wall banged , then banged again . " I give the orders needed , you bastard . Go back where you came from and do it while you can . " <p> He stood and wiped the spit from his lips . The McCurdy chose that moment to slither and spasm beneath them . He could sense the massive torque along her keel . <p> " There it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet wheezed . " You feel it . You 'll be my man before all 's well and done . " <p> He struck the man outright . With the flat of his hand at first , then his rapid fist . The old fellow closed his eyes , and his head went loose on his neck , as though he 'd been beaten before and knew how to take it . Three punches , maybe four . He stopped when the cartilage of the thin , arrogant nose gave way beneath his knuckles . <p> It was Henderson who surprised him . The cook looked like he planned to drive his own fist into the man 's sunken gut . Yet he somehow fell away from the scarecrow collapse of the passenger , every glint of irritation and resolve drained from his eyes . His grim mouth moved in silence . He watched Henderson hard until the cook gasped as if he 'd just discovered air . It was the ship , he thought . The damned strangling ship . Or the garrote of the storm . Henderson had caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speechless , and he had not . <p> It was n't long before the cook came back into himself , ran his blade-nicked hands across his white apron , and offered to haul the passenger to his quarters , clean him up . Henderson 's voice was low and easy , as always . Neither of them mentioned what had just yawed between them . If they spoke of it , they 'd do so after the McCurdy had docked and unloaded and the time for stories had come . He left the galley in silence , turning his thoughts to his stubborn crew and what he would ask of them . The lifeboats would be frozen hard to their tackle , and the one on the bow might not be there at all . They 'd have to go out-on lines or not-and see . And he would go out among them . <p> Some days later he found himself back in Frieda 's kitchen , feeling browbeaten for reasons that were mucky in his own head . He had n't been in touch with his sister for almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his box at the post office , searching for his pension check and finding letters from charities and colored flyers for the Christmas craft fair . He 'd missed the holidays . He stopped at the hardware store and bought his nephews gifts . It would be okay , he thought , to give Frieda money as he usually did . Perfume , a sweater , a scarf-it would n't feel right to buy something like that for her . He planned for them to handle one another as they always had , without decoration . <p> It was the middle of the week , so Frieda put coffee on and allowed him his cigarette , but there was no food . The boys were still at school . The Christmas decorations , which his sister lavished on every surface of her small house , were gone , stored for another year . The brown paper bag that held the unwrapped gifts for his nephews mocked him from the kitchen countertop . A stupid idea . Weak . He smoked in silence , trusting he could hold fast longer than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . He watched Frieda take things out of the refrigerator and the pantry . She stooped and bent , but even in a sweatshirt and purplish jeans , she did n't appear old to him . She was nimble , still concerned with the visitations of failure or success . He was the one who 'd aged . He 'd run from so many things , he 'd pretty much run his way to the end of his life . <p> " You talk to them ? " <p> " Marge and Otto ? Oh , sure . They were here for- " She shook her head in disbelief . " We all got together for the holidays . Just once , but it was nice . Marge brought the ham , and the girls got along all right with C.J. and Chad . Otto complained about the government , as usual , and the bank , too , if you can believe that . He 's on the G.D . board there . I thought Cecil would just bust . " <p> They laughed , both of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good brother , so sure of his restraint . <p> " Sorry I missed the party . " <p> " No , you 're not . And I 'll tell you again what I told you last year . We 've got so we do n't miss you . Do n't even bring up your name . " Frieda was behind him , sweeping the floor . He could hear the hasty , scritching strokes of the broom . <p> " Makes it easier . " <p> " Yes , it does . " <p> He stood and drifted into the den , into the crabbed and narrow hallway that was so much like the hallways of his youth , drifted into the yellow-tiled bath looking for something to tinker with . When he asked Frieda where he might find replacement screws for the hinges of the clothes hamper , she handed him a shoe box of junk-buttons , paper clips , hardware-and told him to get on with it . He wanted to thank her for taking him up again , but he did n't . He thought about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unspoiled or new . He was sorting nails and scrap when his nephews charged into the house , faces stung red from the cold , their cheap , oversized parkas flapping . <p> They launched into competing stories about teachers and bus brawls before they saw him . C.J. , the young one , clammed up at once . Chad dropped his backpack on the table and took up as much space as he could between his uncle and his mom . <p> " Did you tell him yet ? " Chad pinned him with a squint , like he was studying long words on a sign . <p> " No . " Frieda gathered the coats , knocked the slushy boots into a corner . " Has n't come up . " <p> " Well , I 'm bringing it up . Everybody 's talking about it . " <p> " Just to be gross , " C.J. said , edging out of the room . He was a large-eyed kid , and shy . " You like to think about him underwater all winter , down there with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Frieda waved an arm as though she was goodhumored and tolerant , but he could see the creases around her mouth deepen and how she would n't look his way . " Out of here , and keep it down . Uncle John and me are talking . " <p> " Then talk to him , will you ? " Chad strode into the den . " It 's like he lives in the desert or something . " <p> He did a calm inventory in his head . The family was fine-he knew that . Something local , then . A thing spectacular to people who decided to share their tragedies . <p> " It 's just one of those sad messes kids get caught up in because it bothers them . Maybe it 'll bother you , too . It was the one you know , Paula 's boy . He was running hay out to Mackinac , for the horses there , and the ice broke in a freak way . He 's so far down , they ca n't even dive for him . Driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> He looked at her , reacquainted himself with the wrinkles around her eyes . <p> " Plain bad luck is what they say . A squall got them off-track and they say one of the snowmobilers-some relative-was drunk , but they did n't do anything stupid . People make that run all the time . " <p> " Been making it for years , " he said . <p> " Yeah , " she said , looking at him like she could n't quite bring his hairline into focus . " Horses have to eat just like the rest of us . Some guy in St. Ignace has the contract , and he let this kid , what 's his name , drive the Cat because he asked to . The paper said some nice things . " <p> " Same as dying in a car wreck , " he said . <p> " Maybe so . All the way to the bottom , though , that 's different . Feels different to me . " <p> She went on then-to a salting and pounding of meat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . He did n't . He stood and rinsed his mug , emptied the green glass ashtray into the trash , found his hat and gloves on top of the refrigerator where he 'd left them . Only when he went to put on the gloves did he realize his left fist was clenched . When he opened it he saw two wood screws pressed deep into his callused skin , so deep they ought to hurt . <p> " I 'm sorry , " his sister said . Her arms were folded tight over her chest , but her face was elongated , soft . <p> " About what ? " <p> " You know what I mean . " And she moved after him to shut the door , sealing her house again from the cold . <p> When he pulled in across from The Chinook , he realized that his mouth was wet and drooling for a drink while his throat was wrung dry . Divided up , he told himself . Same old story . He went inside , nodded to the men playing eight ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ordered a Coke , and the bartender , a redhaired guy he did n't know , brought it to him right away . He left a good tip and moved to an empty round table against the wall . A stuffed salmon bucked on the wall above him . The air smelled of fry grease and sleep . <p> He finally thought to slip his coat off so he would n't look like he was on the run . Chewed on the ice in his Coke and watched the pool players circle the table like boxers , high-shouldered and flat-faced . He did n't have to wait long . She brought him a second Coke in a highball glass and sat down across from him . <p> " Hello , John . " She 'd always said it the same . <p> " Hello , Paula . Thought I 'd come see the sights . " He took in her face , which was thinner ; he looked for gray in her hair or any bad sign of grief . What he could see right away were diamond-chip earrings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " New jukebox . We got that for big dancers like you . And the kitchen 's been redone . You want some food ? " <p> " No , " and he shook his head as her wide-set brown eyes smiled . He 'd been puke-sick in front of her in the old days , there was that humiliation . He 'd touched her some as well , as much as she 'd allowed from an earnest drunk , since she had three or four kids already . That had happened maybe half a dozen times in ten years of drinking , shipping out , moving on . What he 'd kept with him most was what hung before him now-her lovely , unassailing face . <p> " I heard about your boy . " <p> She sat back in her chair and brought a hand up along her neck and ear . Her nails were still short-bitten . " I knew you were here because of that . You remembered , did n't you ? That time with the puppy . It 's good for me to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , even while she was trying not to , and the tears ran alongside her small , blunt nose . " I did n't see much of Frankie lately . He was living with his father 's people . Wanted to do for himself . " <p> He looked down , saw that his distant fingers were shredding a napkin . <p> " He loved when you sent me home with that crazy pup . Thought it was pure German shepherd and told everybody that , bragging . He was gon na train that dog , too , but it got killed on the road . " <p> All those kids , tangled shapes of her kids , tangle of what she said about them , and him never bothering to sort them out by name or size or worry . No one in The Chinook had . And one of them was Frank , into his life then out of it like an ass-whipped bad dream . He sat there knowing he 'd never given any kid a dog . <p> " He should n't have been on no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid . " <p> Paula tensed , looked at the wall next to them , then back . <p> " He was stupid about laying his traps , too . I could have told him if he listened one damn- " He choked up on his loud words as he realized the redhead bartender was watching him , and Paula was watching , too , but not in the right way . <p> " You come in here for whiskey , I wo n't sell you whiskey . " She wept openly , with the light of temper rising in her eyes . " Do n't talk down my boy , neither . It was an accident . Nobody meant no harm : ' <p> " I knew him . " He felt terribly hot under his clothes , like he needed to tear them open . " We got along , and then we did n't , and I tried- " <p> " Say you 're sorry , John . Then move on like we both got to . I 'm marrying Pete Norlund . " She sniffled and drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was with Pete . And now I do n't got that battle to fight . " <p> He took hold of his riptide mind , grappled and thought about Norlund , a barrel of a Swede older than himself , made rich off timber and real estate . There 'd been a stout wife around , last he 'd heard , but something had clearly been done about her . <p> " Maybe it 'll go good , Paula . You deserve it if anybody does . " <p> " Still know how to make sweet , do you ? I did n't never forget you or the things you did " She stood and covered one of his hands with hers while she reached for his empty glasses . A brush light and warm , but he could feel it go deep just before it left him . Saw her ring , too , set with hard , permanent diamonds . Norlund had a big glassy house on the lakefront . He would work to imagine her in there . <p> " Sorry about your boy . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty of tears and walked from him . A black , sleeveless blouse that was more modest than it needed to be . Good boots , tight jeans . Her long , thick hair fanning out from a silver conch clip that he immediately recognized , so like the ones he 'd almost brought to her after his trips away , the ones he 'd fingered and never bought in those smiling , jostling marketplaces far from home . <p> He took note of the ragged cuticles of snow left by the plows . Of the snapped-off tree branches . Of the convoyed clouds to the south . There was a way to carry on that every sailor learned after his first few watches-a way to remain alert but separate , never mesmerized or confused by the shape-shifting of fool water or the sky . Peering ahead , looking for decisions to make-that was the way a man remained clear . <p> He parked on the track , leaving room to swing the canoe out of the shed . He looked her over carefully first , eyeing the seams , checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square of cloth from a shirt and some ambroid glue . She rested cleanly on her braces , a beamy wood-canvas shell . He 'd bought her from an old steam-tender who 'd foulhooked the end of his luck , gave the man a sluggish Grumman and a hundred dollars in exchange . The steam-tender said she came from Minnesota and was made the old-time trapper way , to last forever . Whatever the truth , she handled well in light water and was easy enough for one man to portage . He slid her off the braces , flipped her , then worked her up on end until he could yoke up between the varnished , seatworn thwarts . The snow was crusty and deep . It would be a long , panting carry . <p> By the time he could see the wide silver scuff of the bay , he 'd begun to sweat through his second shirt . <p> He took the canoe to the place he always took her , next to a great smooth log that had washed ashore in a spring storm not long after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer he chained the canoe along the far side of the log , but he did not chain her now . He merely nestled her into her accustomed place , protected as much from wind and weather as she could be . He was months early . Porcupines or others might do her some mischief , though it was not a possibility that bore thinking about . He 'd make up a special buoy before long , get together a good anchor and plenty of strong line . What he needed to consider now was when he would next be out on the water , stroking through the rocky blue shallows of the bay into the lake . <p> He made his way downshore to a natural cairn of porous , fossil-etched stones , swept them clean of snow , leaned against them . Mackinac Island was a tired mirage beneath the translucent clouds , a smudge of dirtied crystal . Winter had leveled it , as it leveled them all . The boy he 'd known had done nothing but take on a few jobs , try on his shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than anything had ever hurt him . He knew he would n't set foot in The Chinook again , not even to recast his words to her , the ones he 'd meant to say better . If he took up liquor , he 'd go to the next town to drink it , or drink it in the hidyhole of his shack like he was expected to . <p> The sun drifted west until the snow on the lake was shadowed in lavender and blue , and the trees drew themselves into a phalanx of darkness at his back . He had always cared for this , the way the lake sealed itself off , flat and silent and hidden . There was nothing practical to be done about the boy . He could walk the ponds and try to locate the beaver traps , though the uncle would surely come after them before long-maybe he 'd come with the girl-and he had no business pretending he was a help to anyone . He was not . <p> His sweat cooled but did not dry , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hush of an unhindered night brought Henderson back into his mind . Strong , private Henderson , who should have been a cook on the lollygagging , sweet-tempered Pontiac with its simple runs to Buffalo , but who kept manning the slipshod McCurdy in his mind . It had been Henderson who 'd done the visceral thing . <p> He 'd run his gang out along the decks , captain 's orders , as they needed to know how bad things were with the boats and hatches and rails . Most of them went on safety lines-the decks were slick , the air burned with sleet-but he and Quillian , a true Newfoundland bastard , went footsure and unfettered . They 'd discovered the worst , and he was on his way to report to the captain when he saw a man peering at him through a scleric portal . Henderson . Broad and searching in his foul weather gear , face pressed against the murky glass . He feared the cook wanted to volunteer for his crew , and he did not want that to happen . <p> He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bosun would need a look at the number three hatch ; he 'd take him there . There was some relief in the orders that followed , the risks , the sleight of hand it would take to get through the remainder of the storm . There was a kind of march to the whole thing that he relished-a sailor 's muster and charge-all done to the drumbeat of weather and damage . <p> Quillian was waiting for him below deck , his face and cap beaded with melting sleet . " The Indian 's gone out there . I told him not to . " Quillian spoke with neither urgency nor judgment . Narrow talk , the speech of an islander . <p> " I 'll get him . He has some crazy idea about helping . " <p> " Do n't know about that , " Quillian said . " Had his duffel with him , like he meant to leave . " <p> He pushed his way out then . The deck lights flickered in the thick spray and wind , teasing his sense of balance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow trough , water spewing green and black across his face . They 'd been spared by the genius of the chief engineer so far , but if she caught beam seas again , caught them hard enough , the decks would be carried under . He looked midships for Henderson , thought again of the blackjacked look in the cook 's eyes when the passenger had sworn them off , and made his way down an accursedly icy ladder and aft . Henderson was on the fire crew . Maybe he was crazy enough to take his drill station . If he was still onboard at all . <p> He found him leaning over a beaten section of railing , sweeping his arms above the frenzied leap of water . Madness . Or an Indian thing , maybe . Or just madness . He 'd ask him to come back with him , to the galley for coffee , but if he would n't come , so be it . The lake knew her business . He did not move , however , when he saw Henderson lift his duffel-stuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bag went overboard , and while he waited a pitiless moment for Henderson to follow the duffel , it did not happen . The cook turned and saw him through the dim shower of spray and nodded , his rain hat tied tight beneath his squarish chin . It was as though he 'd known he was being watched . Henderson then passed by and made his way up the ladder with slow purpose . He followed the cook until he met up again with Quillian and the hard-pacing bosun . There were no words exchanged . They all went on with their jobs . <p> He did n't hear about the passenger until the next day . Awake for thirty hours until the weather broke , out dead for four hours ' sleep , then back into the crowded mess for some breakfast . He did n't hear about it from Henderson , who was preparing a sherry souffle for the captain , his apron starched flat , his black hair drawn into a neat , foreign-looking knot at the base of his skull . He heard it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cabin with dean towels and linens . The fellow was gone ; the cabin as tidy as a commander 's . They were looking for him in every bunk and locker , knowing how panic could make a rat out of any man , but some who 'd met him or seen him walking the decks before the storm did not expect to see him again . This was what the steward said , working the tale slowly around his soft Caribbean vowels , savoring it for the drinks that a longer , more lush version would someday buy . <p> He knew . And could feel the knowledge loop about him like a fresh manila line , connecting him hard to Henderson and that damnable yakking man . To Quillian , too , no doubt , though the Newfie would never speak of what he 'd seen , as he lived ancestrally in the gap between what he witnessed and what he needed to act upon . <p> Now , standing on a plain of sharded dark and light , at the edge of water and his land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look Henderson in the eye after that moment . He could not recall what they 'd said to each other , though he knew they must have spoken-each of them - and let the words wrap the shroud on tight . Had they ever gone that far ? He knew well how the McCurdy had been towed back to Duluth by a Coast Guard vessel with a belligerent crew . He knew Henderson had left the ship , as all the crew did , off to sign onto other freighters while the McCurdy underwent repairs . Henderson in his massive pea jacket , his oft-healed hands , a neatly packed duffel like a rolled sail across his shoulder . They had said goodbye to one another in the usual brief way , as there were always things left unspoken when a man passed by another man . He remembered that he never questioned Henderson 's reasons . The passenger may have died on that pitching galley floor , or , good Christ , he may have begged to taste the saltless water of their particular sea . There had been a reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembled heart that worked inside Henderson . <p> He walked onto the ice . First to where it laced around the lifeless rocks . Then to where the water of the bay deepened and he could have fished if he cared to and speared his share of whitefish and pike . Beyond , the ice grew thinner and might have groaned and pealed beneath him , but it did not . He went on , to the point where his canoe would begin to feel the draw of the great lake , its deep currents and cold logic . He would plant a hand-painted buoy when the ice broke , pay his delayed respects . The boy was out there , open-eyed and washed and preserved , a victim of risk and channel water , but all he could see were the pitiful man-lights that necklaced Mackinac and adorned her property . He turned back only when the wind rose from the black distance and drove into him , squalling with snow and bitterness . Only when he could be driven ashore like a sail with no good hull or keel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it was how his watery heart now worked within him . <p>
