<p> On the second floor of a century-old brick theater building here , the staff at Chelsea Green Publishing has been puzzling over the phenomenon of " The Straw Bale House . " <p> Five years ago , when Chelsea Green first published the guide for building a home out of straw bales , it expected to sell a few thousand copies . Now , even though there are only 1,000 or 2,000 such houses in the nation , sales are nearing 100,000 . <p> Chelsea 's handbooks for the environmentally concerned are clearly not just decorating bookshelves in communes . They also appeal to city dwellers  --  armchair farmers who dream of quitting the rat race and living naturally . <p> " They like to dream about growing their own food , preserving their own food , or they 're curious about how to live off the energy grid in a solar house , " said Ian Baldwin , who founded the company with his wife , Margo , in 1984 . " They are people who are inspired by environmental tales that have a profoundly hopeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell profit for Chelsea Green . Since devoting itself to the art of " sustainable living " in 1992 , it has righted its wobbly finances , doubling its sales since 1996 to more than $2 million . It has gone from publishing four books in 1994 to 26 this year , creating a back list of almost 100 titles that range from tomes on organic gardening to " Hemp Horizons , " a guide to marijuana 's legal cousin by John W. Roulac . <p> Ian Baldwin knows the city dreamer 's mind-set well , having lived in New York for 25 years . While working as a fund-raiser for nonprofit organizations like the National Audubon Society and the Environmental Defense Fund , and as a publications director for the Institute for World Policy , he fed his natural side by bird watching in Central Park and tending a garden apartment in Brooklyn . By 1982 , his family decided it was time to get out . <p> They moved to Vermont , and , drawing on Mr. Baldwin 's experience working for a large publishing company in the 1960 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The couple looked , quite simply , for books that appealed to their diverse interests , including nature , travel and art . Their first book was " The Man Who Planted Trees , " by Jean Giono , a fable about a shepherd who devotes his life to reforesting Provence . Then followed " Permanent Parisians , " a guide to Paris cemeteries by Judi Culbertson and Tom Randall , and a book on the Norwegian painter Edvard Munch . <p> While there were successes in the eclectic collection , there were an equal number of failures . Substantial advances went to authors for books that were never written . The staff was cut from 11 to 4 . <p> " In 1991 , I came close to trying to sell the company ; it was very bad , " Mr. Baldwin said . " Those were more difficult years than any I had in New York . " <p> Then the company found its niche . Mr. Baldwin had brought in Stephen Morris , a business strategist and fellow Vermonter , as a consultant . Mr. Morris had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturer , but the world of independent publishing made him scratch his head . <p> Mr. Morris recalls telling the Baldwins : " Everything is geared against the small publisher . I do n't even know why you stay in this business . " He pointed to their haphazard publishing style and urged them to focus on one topic . Taking a cue from their own attempt to simplify their lives , the Baldwins settled on " sustainable living "  --  existing in a way that does minimal harm to the planet or other people . Titles would include " Wind Power for Home and Business , " by Paul Gipe ; " Cooking with the Sun , " by Beth and Dan Halacy ; " The Soul of Soil , " by Joe Smillie and Grace Gershuny , and " The Good Life , " Helen and Scott Nearing 's book on self-sufficient living . It was a niche yet to be fully explored by the book industry . <p> The tiny publisher embarked on its own sort of sustainable living , making the most of the resources at hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " partnerships with other earth-friendly businesses . The Real Goods Trading Company , an environmental mail-order house in California whose catalogue reaches millions of people a year , commissioned the publisher to create a book on wind power , agreeing to buy a set number of copies . While bookstores are allowed to return unsold books to publishers , such partnerships create guaranteed sales for Chelsea Green . <p> " It 's sort of our insurance policy against the whims of the book business , " said Mr. Morris , who took over the day-to-day operations as publisher in 1995 . <p> In another symbiotic move , Chelsea Green made its authors ' advances more competitive by pursuing grants from foundations . The Agriculture Department , for example , helped pay the writers ' fees for " Sharing the Harvest , " a book on community-supported agriculture . <p> It also experimented with all-natural marketing . For Book Expo America , a conference that attracts thousands of booksellers , Alice Blackmer , the national sales manager , had the seemingly clever idea of constructing a display area of straw bales in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw in Chicago to build the display , only to spend frantic hours before the conference dunking the bales in fire retardant when the fire marshal threatened to throw them out . <p> At these conferences , instead of trying desperately to grab a few minutes with bookstore representatives , Ms. Blackmer passes out copies of a home-made video that highlights Chelsea Green 's newest releases . It opens with a guitar-playing country western singer ( a.k.a . Ted Mortimer , the business manager ) and his version of the environmental blues : " I fell through a hole in the ozone , when I walked out on you . . . " <p> The increased sales are not just the result of a rush to self-sufficiency driven by millennium paranoia , though Chelsea Green does offer " Y2K and Y-O-U : The Sane Person 's Home-Preparation Guide , " by Dermot McGuigan and Beverly Jacobson . In fact , unlike some of the environmental literature of previous decades , there is little doom and gloom in the Chelsea Green catalogue . <p> " There 's a really good sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chief . " There 's a sense that there 's some dire news in the world and that the role that we have to play is in some cases to be fun pokers and in some cases to be gentle reminders that sanctimoniousness is n't going to save us either . " <p> While the books do make it to the front lines , with professional farmers often reordering copies of " New Organic Grower " to replace their well-thumbed and muddied ones , Mr. Schley strives to make even the most technical handbooks enjoyable narratives . <p> As a former editor of poetry and literature , and a poet himself , he has a particular ear " for authors who have an interesting story to tell , " he said , even if that story involves composting toilets or masonry heaters . " They have a philosophy and a personality that comes through in the prose . " <p> Chelsea Green found four such personalities in David Bainbridge , David Eisenberg , and Athena Swentzell Steen and her husband , Bill Steen , all homeowners or builders who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bale House , " they write that straw , a popular building material in Nebraska in the late 19th century , has attracted attention in the 1990 's because it is readily available , inexpensive , saves trees , and is an excellent insulator . Color photographs show a selection of completed homes , their tightly packed straw walls smoothed over with stucco . These are not grass huts , but stylish houses adorned with tile floors , french doors and sun decks . <p> Yet because of the time and techniques involved , it is not necessarily less expensive than building a traditional house . <p> Like any best seller , " The Straw Bale House " has its sequels : " The Rammed Earth House , " by David Easton , " The Passive Solar House , " by James Kachadorian and , for the truly adventurous , " The Earth-Sheltered House , " by Malcolm Wells , all by evangelists of innovative shelter . <p> Some book ideas come from comment cards sent in by readers . A list on the office wall titled " Other topics that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permafrost , methane digesters , nomading and animal liberation . <p> Sustainable living covers many topics , Mr. Morris said . " We can also publish things that are right out there on the lunatic fringe . " <p> But he bristles at the suggestion that the books are feel-good fantasy . " This is not Chicken Soup for the Sustainable Soul , " he said , alluding to the inspirational books that have made a fortune for another small publisher , Health Communications . " These are mostly practical books that are firmly grounded in reality . " <p> The hefty straw house book is packed with detailed diagrams of roof styles and foundations , trenchant discussion of the perils of humidity and advice on the placement of load-bearing bale walls . Ms. Blackmer says there are now contractors in California who deal exclusively in straw bale houses . <p> The staff frequently turns for professional wisdom to the company 's directors , many of them publishers who look as fondly on Chelsea Green as farmers over a prize crop of organic soybeans . George Gibson of Walker &; Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialty has made Chelsea Green successful . " When people look for books in this arena , they look for Chelsea . " <p> " Entry into this business is very easy  --  all you need is a Xerox machine , " Mr. Gibson said of small publishing . " Succeeding at it is n't easy . " <p> It 's too early to tell whether it will follow the path plowed by 62-year-old Rodale Press , whose founder , J. I. Rodale , made " organic " a household word with his books and magazines on gardening . Today , Rodale is a multimedia empire , with books on well-being accounting for about half of its annual $600 million revenue . <p> For now , Chelsea Green finds most of its competition in the scattered " sustainable " books of large publishers and the more academic offerings of nonprofits . <p> While some small publishers pin their success on one or two best sellers , " with Chelsea Green , what you see is what you get , " said Bill Hammond , president of Publishing Strategies International in Minneapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A novel might sell well for a month , three months . These books sell well year after year . Sometimes they sell better in the third year than in the first . " <p> And so what if all those people are n't building houses out of straw ? As Jim Schley , the editor ( and solar-home owner ) , said , " Even if they do n't do it , they 're more likely to support the issues .
