We 've been salivating over the idea of a domestic dirt rig for years , but held back because the project would have been ridiculously incomplete without a made-in-America rear derailleur . When 3 U.S.-made rear changers appeared this year , completion was close enough to tempt us . What you see here is the result . The wait was worth it . As the American rear derailleur gestated , stateside component makers refined their cranksets , hubs , and brakes into works of ingenious , functional art . We picked parts for the bike based on performance , weight , reputation and appearance , with little regard for cost . The price of our " Home Brew " is $4,541 . It weighs just 22.2 pounds . Our bike is n't anti-Shimano , nor is it meant to snub any nationality . It 's a pro-American machine , plain and simple  --  a showcase of how far the country that originated the sport of mountain biking has come . * our specs BREW 200 Proof Frame Weight  --  3.53 pounds/Price  --  $1,048 It 's 20 miles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frames , and that 's just the way owner Steve Garn likes it . " The mountain and road bike riding is incredible here , " he says . The company is nestled in the Smoky Mountains near ( sort of ) Creston , North Carolina . Garn and his staff of 4 create 250 road and mountain bike frames per year . Our project frame is TIG-welded of superlight Tange mountain bike tubing ( 0.8/0.5/0.8-mm top-tube wall thickness and 0.9/0.6/0.9-mm down-tube wall thickness ) . We wanted a steel , handmade frame for our project bike , and few small builders use American tubing . BREW TIG-welds frames with argon gas inside to minimize weakening oxidation . The down tube and seat tube are ovalized slightly at the bottom bracket to enhance rigidity at those points . Garn , who has been building frames for 10 years , says BREW stands for Blue Ridge Electric &; Welding , but it also harkens to the fact that " there are still a lot of moonshiners in the area . " That also explains the model name , and the hillbilly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch is the side-of-the-top-tube cable routing , which prevents cable " twang " in rough terrain . The open cable routing requires a minimum of cable housing . Paul Powerglide Rear Derailleur Weight  --  186 grams/Price  --  $320 The CNC-machined Paul Powerglide 's angular , anodized look is unique . It 's held together by pins and circlips that can be removed and replaced by a home mechanic . It 's upper pivot bolt , made of 7075-T6 aluminum , is designed to shear upon hard impact and spare the derailleur . We do n't have enough miles on the Paul yet to confirm its claimed longevity , but we do know that it shifts well when paired with Shimano or Shimano-compatible cogs . It 's also easy to set up , thanks in part to its large , easy-to-reach adjuster screws and fat adjuster barrels . It weighs 35 grams ( 1.2 ounces ) less than a Shimano XTR rear derailleur . The Powerglide features a stout return spring that complements the action of Grip Shift shifters .

This new-for- ' 95 compact crankset has chainrings built for its proprietary bolt circles ( 90 mm and 58 mm ) . The smaller bolt circles permit clean execution of a 20/30/42-tooth chainring set . A 30T middle ring is a favorite of cross-country racers because they can stay in it over a wide range of technical , minimizing the need for front shifting . The outer ring is 7075 hard-anodized aluminum . The middle and small are 6Al/4V titanium . The crankarms are CNC-machined , then hand polished to a shine . Drawback : You must use Topline 's chainrings . Gore-Tex RideOn Cable System Weight  --  NA/Price  --  $45 W.L. Gore &; Associates has ingeniously coated derailleur and brake cables with the magic substance , and created full-length cable liners made of Gore-Tex .

SDG S7000 Kevler Saddle Weight  --  229 grams/Price  --  $90 SDG made its name with Kevlar seat covers for motocross motorcycles .
