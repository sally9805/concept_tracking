At the baseball owners ' meeting in Scottsdale , Ariz. , last week , National League senior vice president Phyllis Collins handed a piece of paper to Leonard S. Coleman and asked him for some samples of his signature , which will appear this season on the league 's baseballs . With that , Coleman 's career as National League president officially began in the manner in which he has spent most of his 45 years : leaving his imprint many times over . // From New Jersey to Nairobi , Coleman has compiled such a diverse and impressive resume that the league 's search committee elected him to succeed Bill White as president . " I knew whatever he did in life , he would make a difference , " says Arnie Holtberg , headmaster of a private school , who played baseball with Coleman at Princeton . " He made a difference at Princeton for sure . " // Coleman entered Princeton in 1967 after excelling in football and baseball at Montclair ( N.J. ) High . He was especially passionate about baseball , having grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Brooklyn Dodgers , his father for the New York Giants and an uncle for the Yankees . But Coleman was most proficient in football , as evidenced by the all-state ring he still wears today . " I was part of an all-state backfield with Joe Theismann , Franco Harris and Jack Tatum , " he says . " I 'm the only one without a Super Bowl ring . " // As a sophomore at Princeton , Coleman and four other blacks signed a letter accusing the football program of institutional racism , charging that the athletic department operated without regard to the university 's policy of equal opportunity . " Leonard was very eloquent about that , " says Holtberg . " He spoke out strongly and intelligently but never in a strident manner . The conscience of the university was raised by their stepping forward . " // Coleman 's impact on the diamond at Princeton was considerably less noticeable . As an outfielder he batted .179 in 39 at bats during two seasons for the Tigers . After graduate school at Harvard  --  he earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionary work in Africa , where he began a friendship with Archbishop Desmond Tutu ( Coleman would later chair Tutu 's scholarship fund ) . " A great life experience , " he says of his African sojourn . " No baseball though . " // When Coleman returned to New Jersey , where he still lives with his wife , Gabriella , and their two children , he returned to baseball as well . In 1984 , at 35 , while serving as the state 's commissioner of energy , he dropped " several hundred dollars ' worth " of quarters into pitching machines and worked his way into the Metropolitan Baseball League , which is stocked mostly with college players . " Here I was in the governor 's cabinet , saying , ' I have a game tonight . At three I 'm gone , ' " Coleman says . // In 1988 Coleman left the public sector for investment banking . Three years later he was hired as executive director of market development for Major League Baseball . In that job Coleman helped expand baseball 's inner-city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coleman replaces White not only as the league president , but also as the highest-ranking black executive in sports . Still it may not be until May that Coleman 's mark on baseball becomes evident . That 's probably when the supply of balls with White 's signatures will be exhausted and the Leonard S. Coleman models will be introduced . " That 's exciting , " he says . " But just getting a job in baseball is a dream come true . "
