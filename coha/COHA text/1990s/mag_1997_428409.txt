In 1839 , African Freemen , Seized As Slaves , Struck A Daring Blow For Freedom <p> The news stories that began in late August 1839 bore a whiff of both mystery and menace . A " long , low , black schooner " was sailing an erratic course up the East Coast of the United States , manned by what appeared to be an all-black crew , destination unknown . The ship looked ravaged  --  the sails were tattered , barnacles cluttered the sides  --  but the crew seemed skittish about accepting help of any kind . The men , who spoke no English , brandished cutlasses when other vessels offered to take them in tow . The name on their battered bow was Amistad . <p> That vessel is about to become a household name , with the opening this month of Amistad , director Steven Spielberg 's epic film saga of this dramatic moment in American history . " While making this film , " Spielberg says , " I never felt that I was telling someone else 's story . I felt very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people of all nationalities and races should know . " <p> The ship dropped anchor off Culloden Point near the eastern end of Long Island on August 25 to let a boatload of men go ashore in search of food and water . Encountering two ship captains , they managed to ask , with the help of some creative pantomime , what country they were in and whether the people there had slaves . They made it known that they were from Africa and needed someone to help them sail home . <p> Having steered an erratic course from Cuba , the schooner Amistad anchored off Long Island in August 1839 . After mutineers rowed ashore to barter for supplies , the USS Washington , left , appeared . Naval officers from that vessel took all the Africans into custody . <p> Negotiations broke off until the next morning , when a U.S. Navy survey brig , the Washington , hove into view . The brig 's commander , Lt. Thomas Gedney , suspecting piracy or smuggling , sent a party aboard the Amistad who disarmed the blacks and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ship  --  two Cuban planters , Pedro Montes and Jose Ruiz , and a teenage cabin boy . From them , particularly Ruiz , who spoke English , came the first details of what would become a drama that mesmerized the country . <p> The Amistad , Ruiz said , had departed Havana on June 28 , bound for Cuba 's north coast . The 53 blacks on board were slaves , 49 men belonging to Ruiz and four children owned by Montes . The Cubans had purchased them at the Havana slave market and were taking them back to their homes , along with a cargo including fruit , wine , saddles , cotton and silk . On the fourth night out the slaves somehow freed themselves from their irons and attacked with cane knives they found in the hold , killing the captain and the mulatto cook and injuring Montes . Two seamen escaped in a boat . Led by a strong-looking man in his 20s whom the Spanish called Cinque , the slaves took command of the ship and ordered the wounded Montes , a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sailing east toward Africa in daylight but heading north at night . <p> What Ruiz did not say was that the recently imported Africans had been brought to Cuba , a Spanish colony , in direct violation of a Spanish law against the slave trade . In Cuba , as in the United States , slavery was legal but importing slaves was not . With nighttime landings and falsified documents approved by corrupt officials , Spanish slavers eluded the British ships that tried to enforce the ban . ( Spain and Britain had signed a treaty banning the slave trade in 1817 . America had done so in 1808 . ) <p> By the time the Amistad ended its zigzag voyage , off Long Island , only 43 of the original 53 blacks remained alive ; the others had either starved , perished in the mutiny or died be-cause thirst drove them to drink medicine found in the cargo hold . Cinque was the unquestioned leader . When sailors boarded the ship , he had leapt overboard and tried to escape . After he was recaptured he tried to rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be a match for any two men , " an early news account said , " evincing uncommon decision and coolness , with a composure characteristic of true courage . " <p> Lieutenant Gedney took the ship and the 43 Africans into custody . He brought them to New London , Connecticut , where , at a preliminary hearing , federal judge Andrew Judson ordered the men held on charges of murder and piracy and the children detained as witnesses . The Africans , unable to speak or understand their accusers ' language , sat mute and uncomprehending . <p> The judge ordered the prisoners confined at the county jail in New Haven , where they occupied several rooms above a tavern across the street from the green . Cinque , regarded as more dangerous than the others , was placed in irons in a separate cell . As jails go , the New Haven lockup was relatively relaxed ; the jailer took the children on a wagon ride and allowed the men a daily outing on the green , where their somersaults and acrobatic leaps startled staid New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and three died in September from what was probably dysentery . <p> To most of the people who flocked to the jail to gawk at them ( for a fee of 121/2 cents ) the Amistad captives were a bit of exotica suddenly dropped in their midst , but one group instantly saw them as a cause . Abolitionists were a weak and fragmented band of true believers in the America of 1839 , a persecuted minority on the political fringe . But in these Africans , abolitionist leaders saw a way to humanize the issue of slavery and broaden the campaign against it . Lewis Tappan , a merchant and abolitionist leader from New York , wrote a friend that the Amistad capture was a " providential occurrence . " He had long thought " that the heart of the nation would not be effectually touched except through the power of sympathy . " <p> Within a few days of the Africans ' capture , the " Amistad Committee " was organized , letters seeking donations were in the mail , and several prominent lawyers , led by Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to defend them . Joshua Leavitt , editor of the antislavery newspaper Emancipator , visited them and reported that they were treated well and that all appeared to be " of quiet minds and a mild and cheerful temper . " Other supporters launched a search for someone who spoke their language ( most of the Africans came from what is now Sierra Leone and spoke Mende ) . <p> The Spanish government , in the meantime , weighed in on the other side . On September 6 the Spanish minister to the United States wrote Secretary of State John Forsyth requesting the immediate return of the ship and prisoners to Cuba , where the Africans could be tried for murder and , if convicted , would be hanged or burned . The minister pointed out that the Amistad mutiny took place on a Cuban vessel traveling between Cuban ports and was thus beyond the jurisdiction of American courts . He cited a 1795 treaty between the United States and Spain in which both countries agreed to return property that by " urgent necessity " turned up on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then said only that he was awaiting a decision from President Martin Van Buren . <p> With a trial scheduled to begin in mid-September in Hartford , the real combatants in the case were now coming into focus . On one side was the Spanish government , acting through the administration in Washington ; on the other was the slowly growing movement for the abolition of slavery in America . Van Buren , a Democrat from New York , was primarily concerned with his prospects for reelection in 1840 , which required the support of pro-slavery Southerners . Confronting what he saw as a no-win situation , Van Buren wanted the case to go away , an opinion shared by United States Attorney William Holabird of Connecticut . " I suppose it will be my duty to bring them to trial , " he wrote ruefully to Forsyth , " unless they are in some other way disposed of . " The easiest way to " dispose of " them was to return them to Cuba . <p> The public was becoming captivated by the men from Africa . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filing through the jail to stare at them . Lewis Tappan was visiting when Cinque , " his bearing like another Othello , " was permitted to meet with the others . " They shouted for joy on seeing him , " Tappan re-ported , but Cinque did not seem to share in the jubilation . During a conversation with Tappan and an African he brought along to interpret , the black leader drew his hand across his throat and asked whether the Americans would kill him and the other prisoners . The possibility was on their minds . Some were frightened when they watched a martial ceremony from their cell windows , fearing that they were about to be executed . <p> One scene from Spielberg 's film version of the Amistad saga depicts the moment when the Africans ' leader , Cinque ( center , in chains , played by Djimon Hounsou ) , and his fellow captives are brought , under guard , before a court in Connecticut , in 1839 . <p> In the five months between their seizure in August and their district court trial in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A play titled The Black Schooner , or the Pirate Slaver Amistad was presented as early as September 2 , only a week after their capture . The quickie drama netted $1,650 in its opening week at the Bowery Theater in New York . The owner of a wax museum made life masks of the Africans . A color portrait of a handsome Cinque , carrying a staff and standing in a landscape the New England artist imagined to be African , was reproduced in engravings and sold on the streets . Another artist painted a 135-foot-long panoramic mural , now lost , titled The Massacre on board the schooner Amistad , depicting " 26 of the principal characters " engaged in murder and mayhem . <p> But if many were sympathetic to the Africans , there were plenty of others among the American press and public with only contempt for them . Cinque , one journalist declared , was " as miserably ignorant and brutalized a creature as the rest , " while another writer expressed the common view that the only proper relation of blacks and whites was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1839 called for the defendants to appear first before a United States Supreme Court justice sitting as a circuit court judge , who would rule on the charges of murder and piracy . The district court would deal separately with salvage and property claims , including the question of whether the Africans were property . As the trial approached , excitement ran so high that crowds lined the canal to get a look at the boat carrying the captives to Hartford . <p> Baldwin and two other sympathetic lawyers , Seth Staples and Theodore Sedgwick , Jr. , represented the Africans  --  enough legal firepower , one reporter observed , " to delay anything till the end of the earth . " Their first move was to ask Judge Smith Thompson for a writ of habeas corpus freeing the children , who were not accused of any crime . This was a test of whether the circuit court was willing to treat them as persons and not property . The three girls were so frightened that they burst into tears on entering the courthouse . <p> Prosecutor Holabird asked the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the President decide whether to send them to Cuba or Africa . Baldwin wanted to know how the United States government came to speak for Spain . He then raised the larger questions of color and slavery . It was only because of their color , he said , that anyone presumed they were slaves . They had in fact come here for asylum , and " I say there is no power on earth that has a right again to reduce them to slavery . " The United States was not a " slave-catcher for foreign slave-holders . " <p> But Judge Thompson was having none of the abolition debate . To him the question was not freedom but jurisdiction . After three days of arguments he ruled that United States courts had no jurisdiction in the murder and piracy charges because the alleged crimes had occurred on a Spanish ship in Spanish waters . This meant that the Africans were no longer charged with a crime . But were they " property " ? This , the judge said , the district court would decide . Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpus request . Judge Judson of the district court now took over ; the next step , scheduled for November , was the trial on the property issue . <p> The abolitionists still needed a good Mende speaker . In early October , Prof. Josiah Gibbs of Yale University , an expert on Hebrew and other languages , made a breakthrough . Gibbs first learned to count in Mende by putting pennies in different quantities before the prisoners , discovering that eta meant one , fele two and so forth . He then went to the New York waterfront , stopped every black seaman he saw and counted to ten in Mende . He finally found James Covey , an ex-slave and seaman on a British warship who spoke Mende . Gibbs took him to New Haven where they met the captives at breakfast . When they heard him speak their language , an observer said , " breakfast was forgotten and all seemed overwhelmed with joy , all talking as fast as possible . " <p> Now , at last , they could tell their stories . They said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa for different reasons  --  some kidnapped , some captured in wars or sold to pay debts , in some cases by other Africans . They were marched in chains to the slave port of Lomboko and crammed on a Portuguese slaver where they were fed sparingly and forced to sleep chained together in a hideous four-foot-high hold . Landing at night in Havana , they were taken to the " barracoon , " or slave market , where Ruiz and Montes bought them . On the Amistad the mulatto cook told Cinque , apparently as a cruel joke , that their owners planned to eat them . This , one African said , " made our hearts burn . " Cinque found a nail on deck and used it to break the chain that fastened all of them to the wall . They then freed themselves , found the cane knives , and struck for their freedom . <p> This masterful 1840 portrait of Cinque was commissioned by a black abolitionist . <p> The man who would become their most important defender was at this point still just an interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my time and all my good feelings , " former President John Quincy Adams wrote in his journal that October , " is the case of . . . African negroes taken at sea . " The brilliant and fiercely independent Adams , a leading foe of slavery who was detested in the South yet was skeptical of the abolitionists as fanatics , was at the time a 72-year-old congressman in the twilight of a magnificent career in which he had been a senator , diplomat and Secretary of State as well as President . " Old Man Eloquent , " as he was called , researched the law on the Amistad case but confessed that he still had more questions than opinions , though his sympathy was engaged . In a letter published almost two months later , he wrote that the Africans had been " cast upon our coast in a condition perhaps as calamitous as could befall human beings . " After chronicling what had happened to them since , he asked , " Is this compassion ? Is it sympathy ? Is it justice ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial to January . In the meantime , a new and critical witness for the Africans appeared . Dr. Richard Madden , an abolitionist who had served as the British antislavery commissioner in Cuba , had volunteered to tell the American court how Cuban slavery worked . Testifying in the judge 's chambers , the Irish-born Madden explained that the Cubans circumvented the ban on the slave trade by fraudulent documents for which officials collected $10 per slave . Cubans classified slaves in two categories : ladinos , who had been in the country long enough to learn Spanish , and bozales , who were newly arrived from Africa . The Amistad blacks had been deliberately misclassified as ladinos to deceive British inspectors who might check their papers . Madden told the judge that 25,000 Africans had illegally entered Cuba in the past three years . An impassioned advocate who had de-scribed Cuban slavery as the most terrible form of that evil in the world , Madden had one more point to make : the return of the Amistad blacks to Cuba would mean certain death . <p> The throng that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on January 7 , 1840 , showed that the public 's fascination with the Amistad drama remained intense . The Africans arrived in coats and mufflers provided by their defense committee . Students from Yale 's law school and theological seminary sat in the audience . It was evident that the government 's task  --  proving the defendants were property  --  would be difficult . Witnesses testified that Ruiz  --  now back in Cuba  --  had admitted that the captives were newly arrived from Africa , thus in effect acknowledging that they were not legal slaves . <p> The man the crowd was waiting for appeared on the second day . Cinque gave his evidence with Covey interpreting , while the spectators listened with what one described as " breathless attention . " He told of his capture in Africa and the voyage in the slave ship , demonstrating by sitting on the floor the painfully awkward position the Africans had to maintain , trussed in manacles , their hands and feet bound together . The audience 's reaction was " instantaneous silence and solemnity , " a newspaper said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slave market and the way Ruiz felt their bodies before buying them . <p> As he testified , the U.S. Navy schooner Grampus sailed for New Haven Harbor , secretly dispatched by the White House with instructions to load the Africans aboard and depart for Cuba immediately following the anticipated verdict against them . The commander 's orders were to retrieve the defendants as soon as the court ruled , without waiting for an appeal by the defense , a clear violation of judicial process and their rights . Van Buren 's anxiety about his reelection  --  he eventually lost to William Henry Harrison  --  was apparently growing desperate . Reports surfaced later that the abolitionists also had a ship waiting in the harbor to rescue the Africans if the decision went against them . <p> But by the time Roger Baldwin made his closing argument it seemed clear that the abolitionists had prevailed and that neither side needed an escape ship . Judge Judson had signaled his attitude early by declaring that " it was idle to deny " the captives were from Africa  --  and thus legally free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that they were " born free and ever since have been and still of right are free and not slaves . " They had been seized in violation of " their own rights and of the laws of Spain . " <p> The overflow crowd outside the courthouse got the news as the contestants emerged . The judge ordered them to be delivered to President Van Buren for transport back to Africa . The judge even managed a sort of benediction : " Cinque and Grapeau another prisoner who testified shall not sigh for Africa in vain , " he proclaimed . United States Attorney Holabird filed an immediate appeal as the Grampus quietly left the harbor . <p> With the case now headed for the Supreme Court and not due to be argued there until early 1841 , the deliberations entered a new arena . In Congress , John Quincy Adams pressed successfully for a resolution compelling the government to publish its correspondence with Spain on the Amistad affair , including the order to the Grampus . When abolitionists approached Adams to argue the case in the high court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctantly consented after first pleading " age and inefficiency . " For this cause , " for the progress of human emancipation , " he was still ready for a fight . " My conscience presses me on , " he wrote . <p> Adams and Baldwin visited the Africans in November at a house their friends had found for them in Westville , near New Haven . Still in custody , the men slept in a row of bunk beds in a single 30-foot-long room Bible-reading demonstration " very indifferent . " The youngest of the male Africans , an 11-year-old boy named Kale , had nevertheless learned to read and write well enough to compose a remarkable letter to Adams . " Dear Friend Mr. Adams , " he began , " I want to write a letter to you because you love Mende people and you talk to the grand court . . . . We want to ask the court what we have done wrong . What for Americans keep us in prison ? . . . Mende people have got souls . We think we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . All we want is make us free . " <p> In December Adams began preparing his Supreme Court argument , which he viewed as an attack on " the abominable conspiracy of this government against the lives of those wretched men . " His main anxiety , he wrote in his journal , was that he would lose his self-possession in " overheated zeal . " Arguments began in the Court 's crowded chamber in the Capitol on February 22 , 1841 , led off by Attorney General Henry Gilpin , followed by Baldwin . <p> Adams ' turn came on the 24th . " I had been deeply distressed and agitated till the moment when I rose , " he wrote , " and then my spirit did not sink within me . " Ralph Waldo Emerson once praised " the wonders Adams could achieve with that cracked and disobedient organ "  --  his voice  --  and Adams employed it now to deliver an address full of fire and controlled indignation orchestrated in symphonic cadences . He focused on the administration 's self-appointed role as Spain 's agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unfortunate , helpless , tongueless and defenseless Africans " but sympathy to their oppressors , " sympathy with the white , antipathy to the black . " The Spanish , he continued , demanded that the President " first turn man-robber . . . next turn jailer . . . and lastly turn catchpoll and convey the captives to Havana to appease public vengeance  --  the vengeance . . . of African slave-traders despoiled of their prey and thirsting for blood . " It was wrong of Gedney to seize them , wrong of the court to jail them , and unconscionable to return them to Cuba with government connivance . <p> When Adams returned the next day , he learned that the case was recessed for a week . When he resumed on March 1 he zeroed in on Van Buren 's order to the Grampus . " Was ever such a scene of Lilliputian trickery enacted by the rulers of a great , magnanimous , and Christian nation ? " he demanded scornfully . He closed with a valedictory , mentioning that he had first argued in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust for the last time . " He invoked the names of the great judges  --  now " Gone ! Gone ! All gone ! "  --  before whom he had appeared . <p> Eight days later the Court delivered its verdict . With one dissent the justices found for the Amistad prisoners . Justice Joseph Story ( played in the film by retired Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun , delivering a cameo appearance ) read the decision . The court declared that the blacks had never been lawful slaves and that they were kidnapped and illegally transported to Cuba . Their mutiny was an act of self-defense . The Court re-versed Judge Judson in only one particular : the " Amistads " were not remanded to the President to be returned to Africa , they were on their own  --  free men . <p> The decision , made on narrow legal grounds , set no important precedent and did nothing to change the status of slaves in America ; the notorious Dred Scott ruling , which affirmed that slaves were property , came 16 years later . The importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consciousness of the American people and the enhanced respectability it gave to the abolitionist cause . As Lewis Tappan had predicted it would , the case had touched American hearts . The Africans took the news of their victory with what one onlooker described as a " christianlike and dignified gladness . " In command of their own destiny for the first time in two years , all chose to return to Africa . <p> Their abolitionist patrons increased their religious instruction to six hours a day with the idea that they would become missionaries . The specially built barn they moved into in Farmington , Connecticut , even had a classroom for the purpose . Adams and Tappan tried to get President John Tyler to furnish a ship for their voyage home , but Tyler ignored them . They decided to raise money for a chartered ship through a fundraising tour . By November they had enough for passage on the bark Gentleman . <p> Thirty-five of the original 53 were going home ( another four had succumbed to disease ; one had drowned in Farmington under circumstances some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as-signed to establish a mission in Mende-land . More than a hundred people rose before dawn to bid them a tearful farewell in Farmington . A few nights later there was a final meeting in New York . Cinque made his last appearance before an American audience . The Africans presented a Bible to John Quincy Adams in absentia . On November 27 , 1841 , they sailed out of New York for Sierra Leone . <p> Of the Amistad Africans only one ever returned to America , a young girl who came back to attend college at Oberlin , in Ohio . The others dispersed , some working at the mission set up by what came to be called the American Missionary Association and others returning to their home villages . Cinque spent some time at the mission and may have supported himself as a merchant . Most of his family , he discovered , had disappeared , perhaps killed in tribal warfare or taken themselves as slaves . On the day he left America , Cinque had promised well-wishers that he would take care of the missionaries in Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but not all . Some bad people , same as here .
