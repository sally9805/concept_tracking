Section : ACCESS From birthplaces to retirement homes , the National Park Service interprets sites from the lives of U.S. presidents . <p> SINCE 1933 , the National Park Service has preserved and interpreted a variety of historic sites associated with former presidents , ranging from birthplaces to retirement homes . Before that time , the Park Service supervised large natural areas such as Yosemite , Yellowstone , and Grand Canyon but had few responsibilities for historic properties . Without federal participation , the preservation of historic sites and homes remained primarily the domain of private individuals and groups that acquired and restored them , sometimes with mixed results . The homes of former presidents proved no exception . <p> Private groups restored George Washington 's estate at Mount Vernon and Grouseland , the home of William Henry Harrison , paying great attention to authenticity . Less scrupulous individuals promoted as " authentic " the log cabin in which Abraham Lincoln had been born , even though the cabin was apparently moved and rebuilt after the Lincolns left Kentucky . This did not dampen the enthusiasm of Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln birthplace be made into a " national park of patriotism , " and public sentiment echoed his call . The federal government responded by acquiring the cabin and birthplace site in 1916 , placing both under the supervision of the War Department . <p> Horace Albright , the second director of the National Park Service , believed his agency was better equipped to interpret historic sites than the War Department and lobbied Congress for a larger role in the interpretation and supervision of these sites . In 1930 , Congress responded by creating George Washington Birthplace National Monument and placing it under the Park Service 's supervision . Albright continued his lobbying efforts and in 1933 convinced President Franklin Roosevelt to transfer responsibility for all national monuments , battlefields , forts , and other related sites from the War Department and other agencies to NPS . Since then , more than 20 historic sites associated with presidents have been added to the park system . John and John Quincy Adams <p> Writing from Philadelphia to his son John Quincy , John Adams lamented , " One day spent at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week or winter in this place . " " The Old House , " as several generations of Adamses would refer to it , serves as the centerpiece of Adams National Historic Site in Quincy , Massachusetts , the only national park site to tell the story of two presidents . <p> John Adams bought the house in 1787 while serving as U.S. Minister to Great Britain , and it remained inhabited by the Adams family until 1927 . The Adams Historical Society donated the house and its contents to the federal government in 1946 . <p> The oldest wing of the house was built in 1731 , but many of the later additions and much of the interior design reflect the influence of John Adams ' wife , Abigail . When Abigail first viewed the house , she found the garden " a wilderness and the house a mere barracks , " but after decorating the house and adding rooms , she found the surroundings more comfortable . Many of the modifications were made when the couple lived in Philadelphia , where John Adams served as vice president and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her involvement in the renovations in a 1798 letter to her sister , saying , " I know the President will be glad when it is done ... he has too many publick sic cares to think of his own affairs . " <p> Abigail 's acquisitions reflect her husband 's position as a man involved in world affairs , she furnished the house with Louis XIV furniture from France and porcelain from China and England , as well as a variety of other furnishings from around the world . Later generations of Adamses added their own personal touches  --  for example , the second floor study displays John Quincy Adams ' terrestrial and celestial globes on either side of a marble fireplace added to the room by Charles Francis Adams around 1880 . <p> The site also includes a library built by Charles Francis Adams to house his family 's papers , an extensive garden , and several outbuildings .

Herbert Hoover <p> Not all future presidents were raised-in the luxury offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1874 in a 14- by 20-foot house in West Branch , Iowa , the son of Jesse and Hulda Hoover . " Bertie , " as Hoover was called by his Quaker parents , lived here until he was orphaned at age 10 . Today , the house at the corner of Penn and Downey streets is the heart of Herbert Hoover National Historic Site . <p> West Branch , like many small Midwestern towns during the 1870s , depended on agriculture for its survival . Even those who did not farm , like Hoover 's father , were tied into the farm economy . Jesse Hoover owned a blacksmith shop not far from the Hoover home . As the town prospered , Jesse Hoover sold his shop and opened a farm machinery business . Some time later , the Hoover family moved into a larger house on Downey Street . The family 's prosperity did not last long , however , as Jesse Hoover died in 1881 . After Herbert 's mother died in 1884 , he went to live with an uncle near West Branch and moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One of the difficulties in interpreting a historic birthplace is demonstrating how the site can influence the development of a president 's character . The small town values of individualism and self-reliance Hoover learned in West Branch stayed with him throughout his life , as did the Quaker tenets of humanity and generosity . His term as president was just one facet of a life dedicated to public service . As director general of relief and rehabilitation after World War I , Hoover oversaw relief efforts that fed millions of people in more than 33 nations . <p> In 1939 , the Hoover cottage was restored to its 1874 appearance , using some of Jesse and Hulda Hoover 's personal belongings . The site also preserves a blacksmith shop similar to Jesse Hoover 's , the 1857 Friends Meetinghouse , which the Hoovers attended , and an 1853 schoolhouse built by the Quakers . With some minor changes , the site retains the appearance of Hoover 's neighborhood in 1874 . The Herbert Hoover Presidential Library-Museum also is in West Branch , along with Hoover 's gravesite .

Harry S Truman <p> When a young Harry Truman arrived in Independence , Missouri , with his parents in 1890 , Elizabeth Wallace 's grandparents had lived at 219 Delaware Street for 23 years . Later , while courting Bess Wallace , Truman wrote , " It seems like a hollow week if I do n't arrive at 219 Delaware at least one day in it . " Harry S Truman would arrive at the Wallace House many times during the next 60 years . Harry and Bess Truman lived there after marrying , used it as the " summer White House " while serving as president and first lady , and returned to it after retiring from Washington in 1953 . <p> The house is the focal point of the historic site . Heirlooms from Bess Truman 's families , the Wallaces and the Gates , and furniture bought during the Trumans ' service in Washington fill the house .

Martin Van Buren <p> Lindenwald , Martin Van Buren 's retirement home , is in the Hudson River Valley south of Kinderhook , New York , an area settled by the Dutch .

This may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Van Buren , by many accounts a man fastidious in appearance and accustomed to stylish surroundings , bought the house in 1839 with an eye towards renovating the Georgian-style mansion with additions more suited to the tastes of the time . Van Buren turned his land into the farm of a country gentleman , complete with 220 acres of cropland , fish ponds , formal gardens , and several outbuildings . In 1849 , under the supervision of Van Buren 's son , Smith , the noted architect Richard Upjohn transformed the house into a replica of the popular " Venetian villa " style , adding several modern architectural elements including an Italianate tower . Van Buren died in 1862 , and two years later Van Buren 's son , John , sold Lindenwald to pay personal debts after he and his brothers inherited the property . <p> The house and grounds acquired by the National Park Service in 1976 cover 22 acres .
