from In the Garden of Papa Santuzzu <p> Once there was a poor but honest man , what we call un'omu di pazienza , a man of patience , who worked the whole day-day after day  --  in the unrelenting heat of the scorching sun , casting his nets out into the blue sea , then rowing his little boat wide and far so as to make the nets stretch , then pulling them back , hand over hand , up through the dazzling water , each drop a blinding turquoise jewel , snagging barely enough fish to feed a kitten , let alone a wife and a house overflowing with daughters . The man 's name was Placidu . As the father of a hundred daughters , he was most ironically named . <p> Did I say a hundred daughters ? I meant a thousand . Hey , twenty thousand is more like it . There were so many of them it was impossible for me to keep count ! I have only so many fingers and toes ! <p> As a young man Placidu was exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water in a stream . If there was a rock in his path , he flowed around it . When he had to row his boat against a strong tide , he apologized to each wave for upsetting its wake . He smiled at nearly everything , especially the fruit of the sea that he lifted up into his boat , until both his cheeks became creased with the dimples that all of his grandchildren inherited . <p> One day Placidu fell beneath a spell that could n't be broken by prayer or potion . He discovered a secret island . On this island was a pathway twisting darkly through a thicket . The path led him through nettle and bramble , down valley and up hill , to a secret nook hidden away deep in the forest , where in the center there was a small pond that each evening at twilight filled with the glimmering figures of scores of girls bathing . <p> The girls frolicked in the water , shoulders glistening , long legs fluttering just below the water 's surface , bottoms bobbing delightfully in the gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several girls washed their long dark hair beneath a cascading curtain of water . Then they dove into the pond , knifing the surface with their hands . <p> Each evening Placidu spied on them , squatting beside a fig tree . After a while his appetites grew so inflamed that he grabbed one of the nearby figs and squeezed it until all of its seeds spurted out onto the ground . He did this night after night , again and again and again , until the tree was nearly bare of fruit . <p> One evening as Placidu watched the swimmers , he grabbed the tree 's last fig . As usual , in his excitement he squeezed it until it burst , but now instead of seeds the spirit of the pond leapt from his clenched hand . Placidu fell back , amazed and frightened . <p> The spirit was about as high as a woman 's thumb . Hey , it only makes sense that you ca n't be too tall if you live inside a fig ! But even if you 're small you can still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit and command three wishes , but the clever thing twirled like a trich-trach until Placidu 's palm throbbed with pain . This female spirit accepted no rough treatment or disrespect . <p> She stood on Placidu 's burning palm , one hand on her hip , the other raised , like a sensible mother correcting an errant child . " You say you demand three wishes ? Well , first I 'll ask three questions ! Where do you come from ? Where are you going ? What do you want ? " <p> Placidu 's head spun . He wanted only to tumble in the water with the girls , but his tongue could n't catch the words to express his desire . As to where he was from and where he was going , he 'd never given either concern much thought . So he just pointed to the pool and grinned . <p> Now , spirits generally are n't known for their good tempers . This spirit was particularly testy . " Silly boy , " she proclaimed , " you want to frolic with these girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fruit . Instead of splashing in the water with them , you splash the ground with my seed . All right , I 'll give you something to remember me by ! From this day on , from now until the day you die , I deem that each seed you spill becomes a girl just like one of these girls , and I command that you feed and clothe them and give them a place to live , a house with a tight roof and strong , thick walls and narrow windows covered with jalousies so that sneaky , empty-headed boys like you ca n't spy on them each evening when they 're naked and at play . " <p> Then the spirit and the girls in the pond disappeared . Placidu made his way back to his rowboat , thinking the spirit had been only one of the sea 's occasional hallucinations . But the next day when he walked the twisting trail and returned to the pond he found no one there , and the day after that he saw that the pool of water had nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud and some tender basilicu , which Placidu picked and chewed sadly . <p> The poor fisherman sorely missed his twilight adventures . One evening as he ambled back to his rowboat he saw standing in a nearby field a ewe with the eyes of a woman . Since no one else was about he coaxed the animal toward him , offering her some of the fresh basilicu , and then he grabbed her and rode her back . Within minutes her sides puffed up as if she were about to explode . Then the field filled with a hundred and one baby girls , each mewing hungrily for milk . <p> It took him all night to get them into his boat , all the next day to take them home and feed them , all night to clean them and put them to sleep , and all the next day to feed them again . The cycle spun like a whirlpool that knows no end . Soon Placidu had no time for anything else . There was always some task to do : some crying mouth to feed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook , a stack of bowls to clean , some child 's stinking bottom that needed wiping . <p> " Semu tutti matti ! " Placidu roared , then gnashed his teeth and foamed profusely at the mouth , all the while rolling about on the floor . It was all he could say . We 're all crazy . All crazy . " Tutti matti ! " All crazy . <p> In short , the clever pond spirit had cursed him with a woman 's outlook and life . <p> The girls grew , as all living things do , and Placidu 's appetites swelled , as all appetites will over time , and soon the house was bursting with daughters . <p> " This ca n't go on . This has to stop ; ' said the ewe with the eyes of a woman . " Do something , now , before I go mad . " She handed Placidu a cleaver . " Here , cut it off . " <p> Placidu took his cosa in his hand and stretched it on the wooden table , then raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm started down , each instance halting the blade just before it could strike flesh or wood . Finally he dropped the knife on the table and went out to visit the village priest to inquire how in the world one can both be a man and at the same time remain pure . <p> " Why , whenever it begins to expand , " the priest Said , " sprinkle it with some holy water . " <p> " Holy water ? " Placidu said . <p> The priest nodded . " The coldest you can find . " <p> That night Placidu carried home a jug of holy water . With each twinge of desire he sprinkled and doused himself , and though his cosa became as clean as Saint Joseph 's lily , it still raised its head and expanded . So Placidu went back to the priest . " I did just as you said , " Placidu told him . <p> " Just as I said ? " asked the priest . " Did you kneel on a pile of acorns and beans ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing about acorns and beans . " <p> " You did n't listen , " said the priest . " Before sprinkling it with holy water , you have to kneel on a pile of hard , uncooked beans and acorns . " <p> So Placidu tried kneeling on a mound of uncooked nuts and beans , going so far as to try baskets of broken almond shells and cups of dried peas , but his efforts met with little success . Again he went back to the priest . " I did just as you said , " Placidu told him . <p> " Did you hold out your arms as if you were being crucified ? " <p> " No " Placidu said . <p> " Well , " the priest said , " you have to hold out your arms for at least three hours , until they become as heavy as lead , so heavy you can hardly hold them up any longer . " <p> " But how can I possibly splash on the holy water if I hold my arms out ? " Placidu asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest . He pointed to the straw roof of his hut . " Put your faith in God , and he 'll help you find a way . " <p> Placidu obeyed for several weeks until he finally understood that there was no way to do what the priest proposed . The sheer impossibility of purity was supposed to curb his desires . So Placidu dropped his head and slipped it back into its halter . He resigned himself to his expanding household . " Tutti matti.t " again was all he could say . <p> I was one of Placidu 's many daughters , number eighty-nine thousand seven hundred and twenty-six . I was the stick in the bundle that snapped my papa 's back . Just before the ewe with the eyes of a woman gave birth to me , Placidu proclaimed to the sun and sky and sea and earth that the very next baby to pop out from between my mamma 's legs would be a boy no matter what . <p> The ewe dressed me in man 's clothing . Everyone from leagues around came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and twenty-six . <p> " He 's a beautiful baby , God bless him , " they all said . To ward off the evil their compliments invited , Placidu put around my neck a coral horn . <p> Even though the ewe bathed me herself , she noticed only what her big sad eyes had been told by her husband to see . Placidu wanted a son , so she saw me as her son . Soon I worked beside him on the sea , even though I had a pair of rosebuds on my chest and ! squatted over the baron jar whenever I peed . <p> " Papa , " I said to him one day as we let out the nets , " would your life have been any easier if you and Mamma had sons instead of daughters ? " <p> " Tutti matti ! " he answered , and by this he meant yes , what did I think , with so many extra hands to help him , he would have been extraordinarily wealthy . <p> " Papa , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ? " <p> " Tutti matti ! " And by this he meant that only an idle boat blows wind into its own sails . <p> " Papa " I said , " then why do n't we have a few thousand of my sisters out here helping , too ? " <p> " Tutti matti ! Tutti matti ! " Meaning that a girl 's place is inside the house beneath her mother 's gaze . <p> " And why is that ? " I asked . " Does a daughter not have two hands , just like a son ? Two arms ? Two legs ? Two eyes , just like you and me ? " <p> " Tutti matti ! " <p> " What makes me a boy ? " I asked . " Is it that Mamma cuts my hair ? That I wear these pantaloons ? That I work in the boat beside you ? " <p> " Tutti matti ! " <p> " Look at my hairless chin . My round hips . These apples bursting forth on my chest . Papa , am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Tutti matti ! " <p> " And if you 're concerned that a girl allowed outside the house can not be adequately protected , " I asked , " what possible harm might befall her out here with you in the middle of the vast and lonely sea ? " <p> " Tutti matti ! Tutti matti ! " he replied , looking frantically about , and by this he meant that danger lurked everywhere , and my naive and rash words risked inviting it . <p> " Do you mean that some octopus or eel or stingray might swim by and spy on her ? " I asked . <p> " Tutti matti ! " Meaning that any man 's sight might fall on her and by seeing her the man might come to crave her , and his desires might do her irreparable harm and evil , that a daughter 's place was to be hidden away , to be kept inside and out of sight , locked up and away , screened , cloaked , veiled , shrouded , made secret , invisible , unseen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than girls are the trouble , " I said . <p> " Tutti matti ! " The thickest vein on his neck throbbed wildly and appeared ready to pop . <p> " And yet the girls are punished and made to stay inside . " <p> " Tutti matti ! " Meaning that we would be wise to remember that he did n't create the world . <p> " So all of this is God 's fault , " I said , pointing up to the sky . <p> " Tutti matti ! " Meaning that the gnat struggling in the web is in no place to criticize the spider . <p> " Particularly when the spider 's a man , " I declared . <p> " Tutti matti ! Tutti matti ! " he exclaimed , falling to his knees and beating his chest and repeatedly making the sign of the cross . <p> Of course we 'd gone around in too narrow a circle that day to catch much more than seaweed in our nets , but I saw then how the whole system worked and how truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this boy-girl business simply was n't a productive or intelligent plan . I understood that rules come from community and serve the community 's overall needs . To make good soup , you ca n't have everybody drawing water from the well . Someone 's needed to chop the zucchini . But this idea of keeping my eightynine thousand seven hundred and twenty-five sisters locked inside the house every day seemed to me utter folly and waste . <p> I reminded Papa that God had originally wanted the Virgin Mary to be a Siciliana . God had little trouble finding an appropriate candidate  --  there were virgins in Sicily of every size and age-but the Almighty was unable to find a single Sicilian household where he could send in his pigeon without the bird being attacked by the girl 's mother and a gang of her aunts . <p> " Who gave you permission to sneak in here and talk to her ? " the women would shout at the bird , whacking the terrified thing to death with their brooms . <p> So God searched for a land with looser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stew pot . <p> Cu newdi arrinesci . <p> They who leave , succeed . <p> Departure was my only option , disguise my only way out . A girl traveling alone was viewed as damaged goods , a cracked or broken vessel , abandoned and deserving of shame . She was prey to every vulture gliding the air above her . It was unthinkable for an unmarried girl to live apart from her family . A girl without family was considered as having no value or worth . Where was her father , her brothers , her uncles ? Without men to safeguard her , the vultures would conclude that she 'd done something horrible to cast dishonor on her family . Put crudely , she was a buttana , little more than the devil 's own dirty slut . <p> I was the eighty-nine-thousandth **29;812;TOOLONG daughter of a sheep whose wretched existence centered around nurturing the endless procession of bawling lambs that slid from her womb . My mother lacked the time even to wipe her own pee . There were always three or four dozen infants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in her ear , another thousand crying for water , more thousands squalling for something to eat , still more thousands arguing over a piece of lint or the hint of shadow flitting suddenly across a wall , something so insignificant as to hardly deserve notice but that they felt required her immediate and undivided attention , so that all you could hear inside our house was the calling of " Ma ! Maa ! Maa ! Baa ! Baa ! Baa-aa ! " rising to such deafening crescendos that only a saint or someone truly insane could be unaffected by the din . <p> Sometimes , very late at night , I 'd crawl to her over the straw across all the other bodies . I 'd pick fattened ticks from behind her ears and with my curled fingers comb out her matted hair . There were three or four seconds every night when everyone was silent and she could sleep . I 'd pretend she was my lamb and that I was the ewe . <p> One night in her sleep she whispered , " I 'm drowning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I nearly thought the sound was only her breath . <p> " Mamma " I said , " please forgive me when I run away . " <p> Then a few thousand of the newborns awoke and whimpered and began sucking her raw and dry , and another couple thousand had nightmares and called for her soothing touch , and over here a flock started scratching its fleas , and within a few moments it was a madhouse all over again . <p> No wonder Papa worked the sea ! To be by one 's self , in a boat out on the gray water , seemed beyond Heaven ! The very thought of being alone somewhere was thrilling beyond name . <p> The first time that my father took me out to the sea , the silence was so loud I had to cover my ears . I put a metal pail over my head and beat it with two sticks to match the song in the house I had grown used to hearing ! After a while Papa lifted the bucket from my face . We were alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slate-gray water . Papa was explaining that this part of the Mediterranean between Sicilia and Africa was known as the African Sea . I pulled my first breath of truly fresh air into my lungs . <p> " Lu Mari Africanu , " Papa repeated , gesturing widely with his arms . He cast out the nets and began to row . <p> Then all at once I heard the most terrifying pounding . I clutched my ears and then my chest . My mind raced . The pounding was horrifying . I was certain I 'd die . <p> Papa held me until I calmed down . He explained that the sound was merely the beating of my own heart . <p> " My own heart ? " I said . I 'd never heard it before . I thought he must be joking . " Papa , are you saying that I have my own heart ? " <p> " Yes , my son , " he said . <p> " Not my sisters ' or Mamma 's ? " <p> He shook his head no . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Entirely yours , figghiu miu . " <p> I could n't get over it . " My own heart ! " I cried . <p> So in my jacket , pantaloons , and boots I set off for the Golden Land , where it was rumored that families did n't have eighty-nine thousand seven hundred and twenty-six daughters . As I began to hike the rocky road through the mountains to Palermu , I listened to my heart . Its steady thumping told me there was nothing I would be unable to do . I had the best of both sexes : the guile and wit of a woman , and the appearance and freedom of a man . <p> Understand that people see less with their eyes than with their minds . If they are told that a thing is true , they tend to adapt their vision so as to see it as such . I did n't so much pretend to be a man as forget that I was a woman . On my back were a poor villager 's rough clothes . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handkerchief into my pantaloons to give them a better fit , but that was it for costume . My hair was short , my face tanned dark from the sea . If I pretended anything , it was that I was rich . <p> I realized that becoming a man is n't so much a shift in gender as it is a change in social standing or class . So I pretended to be the son of a wealthy baron , attacked by thieves and stripped of every valuable thing I owned . I lay fiat on my back in a ditch beside the roadway waiting for some peasants to come along and give me aid . I filled the air with loud curses for my miserable robbers , who were so greedy they 'd plucked me bare and left me only their insulting rags . I gave my jacket an extra tear or two for show . I smeared a stripe of mud on my face . Finally I heard a gang of peasants tromping up the road . I let loose a low moan and shouted loud my sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my aid , I did as the son of a wealthy baron would and chastised them for not arriving more quickly . I called them lazy and useless and unworthy of even the air their filthy snouts breathed . Immediately I ordered them to give me water and food . <p> They stood about apologizing , their eyes downcast , while I ate . I made a show of tossing the crusts of their crude bread into the weeds and then had the peasants line up in a row and recite their names , villages , and occupations . Then I told them that I wished to be entertained . By now they were asking if they might carry me along the road on their broad shoulders . It 's still amazing to me how easily they allowed their necks to slip into the yoke my act provided . <p> One man pulled a concertina from beneath his cloak . A second beat time on a tambourine . The sun shone with happy fierceness as the peasants sang . <p> The weather this day is so sharp and alive ! Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife , Whose fat arms and thighs give me such sweet tumbles As I shut my eyes on my life 's trials and stumbles . Lord , before I 'm old , return me to my family ! Pockets bulging with gold after I 've crossed the sea ! While I still have hair and teeth ! May her legs wrap me in their wreath ! May her arms hold me tight ! Now and through the long night ! <p> In Palermu I allowed the singing peasants to tell my tale to the wealthy baruni who crowded around us . They knew that banditi ruled the hills , particularly in the south . Girgenti was a place where a man did n't allow even a fly to land on his nose ! <p> How fortunate I was to have lived , the barons ' sons exclaimed , attributing my luck to my slight build , which they surmised must have posed a minimum of threat to my robbers . <p> I remembered to act unimpressed , pretending I was as rich as any one of these unbelievably wealthy young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sip of cool water . I merely answered questions put to me and expressed my situation . When asked if I was tired from my journey , I sighed and said , " A bit . " They then implored me to rest in someone 's spacious room , where a servant brought me bread , minestra , meat , cheese , and wine . <p> I picked at the food as if its opulence did n't faze me . I sipped some soup and nibbled a piece of the cheese . Afterwards , over cigars , I told the rich sons the story of Placidu 's secret island and pool and the ewe with the eyes of a woman , attributing the tale to my peasant companions . The baruni met my wit with laughter and applause . <p> They insisted that while I was in Palermu I make use of their carriages and drivers . They argued over which tailor 's stitches were fine enough to fashion for me a new and proper suit of clothes . They gave me boxes of cigars and frutta candita . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were instructed to advance me any sum I required . When I just so happened to mention that I 'd intended to visit America , the son of an owner of one of the steamship companies gave me the name of his first captain , whom I called on the following day and who politely shook my hand and bowed before placing me gratis in a cabin of the finest class . <p> In my new clothes , in my shiny cabin , I made my way across the wide , seemingly endless sea . One morning as I strolled the rolling deck , rocked forth and back by the powerfully swelling ocean , my eyes fell on a lonely peasant , skin as dark as an olive soaked in brine , nose like the beak of a hawk , and beneath it a drooping mustache , my husband-to-be , the firstborn son Gaetanu from the province of Girgenti . <p> He was over in steerage walking dizzily among the cattle , clearly every bit as sick as a poisoned dog . I stared at him until his eyes caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a peasant to any baruni , with a sorry look on his mouth as if he were about to spit . <p> Perhaps it was the soot that blew in his face from the filthy smokestacks or the stench of the animals around him or his nausea from the sea . But there was something about him that gave me pause . Something about him arrested me . I felt somehow as if I were looking at another version of myself . If I 'd been born a boy , I thought , I would be exactly him , not so much in appearance but in attitude . He was like my own brother , I thought , the mirror image of my soul . He was everything that I was , only undisguised and in reverse . <p> He wore his cap low , nearly concealing his eyes , like I 'd worn mine when I fished the sea with my father . He slouched his shoulders , kept his hands in his pockets , and kicked whatever lay on the ground ahead of him , exactly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in life to happen , when I felt that nothing but more of the same lay in wait for me , when I desired sluggish fate to advance and ride on the crest of some wind of change . <p> Then the smoke cleared and he looked up at me , his solitary stare piercing the linen of my suit . His eyes were bright and clear . For a full moment I felt that he could see me exactly as I was : the disguised , desperate daughter of a cursed yet stubborn piscaturi and a wide-eyed , flea-infested , absurdly fertile ewe . <p> Every morning the peasant and I walked the deck trading glances until one day he paused within shouting distance and asked what village was I from . The sea raged wildly beneath us . The remaining cattle lowed continually in complaint . <p> My heart beat so rapidly that I could barely yell my village 's name . He said he could tell I was from the southern coast by the sure-footed way that I paced the deck . I told him that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sardines . <p> Ahh , he said with a wistful smile . He 'd never eaten sardines but he 'd heard from those who had that they were delicious . <p> I told him the flavor of sardines held no romance , that after a few months sardines came to taste like paste . He laughed and recited the proverb , " Lu pani di la casa stuffa . " Homemade bread grows tiresome . Then he added , " But to a mouth used to eating slugs and straw , even unromantic paste would be a feast . " He tipped his cap and disappeared among the livestock . <p> We had a few other conversations , none long , all of them across the distance separating the ship 's classes . Soon I was able to convince him to accept some of the food brought each day to my cabin . I told him that on my side of the ship , food was going to waste , and perhaps he could help me distribute it . I do n't know if he ate what I gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needy . Talking to him during the stormy passage tempted me to forget my pretense . My insides softened and grew mutable as wax . <p> People think the immigrant ships went directly to Ellis Island but in fact they stopped first at New York 's Hudson River Pier , where the American citizens and first-class passengers departed . The immigration officials inspected me onboard ship the afternoon the ship docked . <p> Remember I told you that people see what their mind tells them to expect . The doctor expected to see a young Sicilian nobleman , so when he entered my cabin that 's precisely what he found . For the occasion I wore a silk scarf over my vest , and I puffed a thick cigar . <p> The doctor apologized for the interruption and inspected my eyes and ears and felt and measured the strength of my pulse . I offered him my box of frutta candita . With a nod he gobbled several of the sugared fruits , then looked into my mouth and felt my neck and throat . <p> I asked him where in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we realized we did n't speak the same dialect , I mimed my question until he laughed and understood . ! laughed , too , then . offered him my cigars . He happily stuffed his pockets until I insisted that he keep the whole box . <p> I had only to unbutton my vest and pull up the back of my shirt so that he could listen to my lungs as I breathed and I was through . <p> " Okay " he said . <p> It was my first real American word . I liked the sound of it . <p> " Okay ; ' I replied . " Grazie . " <p> Later I took the barge to Ellis Island , where I waited for the mirror of my soul . As Gaetanu stepped from the tempestuous Great Hall , gazing about at every new thing with obvious fear and wonder , I hailed him and inquired where he was headed . <p> " Albany ! " he replied , smiling so immensely you 'd think Saint Peter had just allowed him inside the gates . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , am journeying to this Albany ! Let 's travel there together , okay ? " <p> He and a dozen other unfortunates were accompanied by a pair of the patruni 's agents , well-fed men in American clothes . " I go with my friend , okay ? " ! told them . " Sure , " they said , smiling at each other with their shiny gold teeth . " There 's always a place for one more . " They led us through a dark passageway that opened into a high-ceilinged room , inside of which stood some sort of narrow house cluttered with wide chairs and walls lined with glass windows . Gaetanu and I sat cautiously on a chair inside the house until the floor jerked forward beneath our feet . Suddenly the entire house began to move ! <p> " May God have mercy on our souls ! " Gaetanu shouted . " It 's the end of the world ? <p> Beneath us I felt a great series of rumbling explosions , then a pair of screams or high whistles from above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with smoke . I feared that a volcano had erupted . The screams must be from those trapped in its burning lava . " We 'd better prepare our souls to die ! " I shouted to my new friend . <p> We 'd both fallen forward onto the back of the wide chair in front of us . I sat up and quickly raised my feet from the floor , fearing the lava that would soon pour through the moving house . Then the room filled suddenly with light and a rocky field flew past the windows , and then the field turned green with splendid grasses , and the rumbling floor beneath us clattered more evenly and quietly , rocking us now from side to side . Another pair of whistles pierced the air . <p> " We 're in a flying house ! " Gaetanu shouted . <p> " Perhaps , " I declared , " though it may be more a roofed wagon . " I decided I had to again act like a baron . " Be calm , " I said in a reassuring tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as the stupid driver does n't hit a tree . " <p> For several minutes then we gazed out the windows , furiously watching out for oncoming trees . <p> The others in the wagon with us seemed unconcerned with the danger . Gaetanu imitated them and then sat back , relaxed . <p> He stared out the windows at the houses and fields . After a while he said , " Look how the flowers grow gracefully beside the other flowers , the thorns and weeds in the ditch beside the other thorns and weeds . " <p> " Yes , " I said . " I see . " <p> " Likes with likes . The same with the same . " He knocked the first fingers of his hands together . " See , they do n't mix like you and me . " <p> " A piscaturi such as me knows nothing of flowers , " I replied . <p> " Yet the fisherman 's son travels across the sea in a cabin of the highest class . " <p> " Only a fool judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed him the callouses on my hands . " Feel , " I said . " My hands are every bit as hard as yours . Would a stranger to labor have hands like these ? " <p> As he traced his fingertips across my palms I grunted and pulled my hands away , as one man would with another , yet inside I felt a hot blush rise in my throat and cheeks . I slapped his shoulder and laughed . " Trust me , my friend , " I said heartily . <p> " My friend , " he said , eyes twinkling , nodding and slapping my shoulder hard in return . <p> Still he continued to test me , asking me if I rode and , if so , how I sat on the horse 's back , whether I held the reins with one or both hands , and with which hand I used the whip . I straddled the seat , knees apart , my right hand holding imaginary reins , my left threatening with the whip . He asked me the proper direction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's preferable to go with the grain of the beard or against it . I said that for the best shave one draws the razor against the beard 's grain after first wetting the hairs with scented water . Then he asked me why , if in truth I were as rich as my clothes , its pockets were even more empty than his . <p> I squeezed the cloth that I 'd stuffed in my pantaloons and laughed and said , " A dozen maidens between the coast and Palermu would swear that my pockets were n't empty . " <p> " Only a dozen ? " he said with a laugh . " On my walk to Palermu I 'm sure I had three times more . " He gave the prominent thickness in his pants a slight squeeze , then elbowed me sharply in the ribs . " Tell me , my friend , what does a man of your class whisper to the girls before you lay with them. * " <p> " Of course I tell them that I love them , the same as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times less often , " I replied . <p> He nodded . " And what do they say to you in return ? " <p> " Why , of course they echo the same words as had been mine , only three times less loud . " <p> He nodded a second time . " And afterwards , what words do you utter as you depart ? " <p> " Of course I say that someday I 'll return , just as you tell all those whom you meet and who love you , only three times less sadly . " <p> His mood grew serious then . " In truth . " he said , " on the road to Palermu I lay with nothing more gentle than the jagged tips of rocks , nothing more generous than hardship . " <p> " May both mistresses be stingy to us , " I said , " now and forever . " <p> " So be it : ' He nodded a third time . " After all , we 're on our way to Albany ! " <p> " Paradise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Golden Land . " <p> " La Merica ! " Gaetanu exclaimed to all seated on the train . <p> God 's blood , the factory in Albany where my Tannu was to work off his debt to the patruni was more like Hell . <p> Blinding fires taller than a house crackled and blazed within endless rows of yawning ovens . The golden flames twisted and writhed in insatiable hunger as the workers scrambled in subservience like ants on a log . Everywhere huge machines roared in an eternally thumping , pounding , ear-splitting din that knew no end . All of this chaos was contained by the factory 's dark , unbroken walls , held down by the ceiling that blocked any breeze or sunlight , so that all the air we pulled into our lungs was stifled and suffocating , wrung dry of any goodness or freshness , tainted by smoke and soot and the fetid smell of grease and metal mixed with oil . <p> How can people go from working their entire lives out in God 's air and sunlight , in his heat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloudy , his calm and windy , to being cut off from all sense of the day 's nature ? Oh , how I missed the forgiving openness of the African Sea ! To be laboring alongside my father , letting out the day 's nets while reciting our prayers for the Lord 's bounty , now seemed a faint dream to me . What mistake had I made coming to this tortured land ? <p> For the first months Gaetanu and I shared a tiny room , living as two men . We slept on the same bed , like monks , feet to head , collapsing on the narrow cot nearly the moment we came in from our day 's labors . Then after an hour or so we 'd rise and eat , mainly pani e favi , a piece of bread big as my fist and a small bowl of beans , along with whatever greens we could find and afford . I washed on the sly after he was asleep , in the women 's bathhouse , avoiding all the various traps that might reveal me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that I was daughter number eighty-nine thousand seven hundred and twenty-six . <p> Gaetanu worried constantly about his debt . He was smart in the way of all campagnoli but was absolutely witless and thick when it came to numbers . Pencils and tablets of paper terrified him . I tried teaching him how to count on his fingers , but he frequently confused directions and in the midst of calculation would end up taking away part of what he 'd intended to add , or adding half of what he was supposed to take away , so that by the time his reckonings were finished he was usually exactly where he had started . Then he would argue with me that his wrong answer was correct and that all calculation and mathematical process were absurd and meaningless . <p> He 'd spend endless hours trying to convince me that one plus zero equaled zero . He would start with one finger raised on his hand , then transfer it to the other , making his first hand into a fist , juggling the one raised finger back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct , until he 'd use the one raised finger to count the number remaining on his other hand , which of course always was zero . <p> Gaetanu was extraordinarily fond of zero . He said it was the most fascinating number because it was so unlike the others , something and yet not something all at the same time . He said that here in the New Land very often he felt the same way . <p> " In Sicilia I used to be something , " he 'd say , raising a finger , " but here I feel just like this , " pointing the finger at his other , empty fist . <p> He liked to hold up one fist and ask me how much . <p> " Zero , " I 'd answer . <p> " No , " he 'd say , " one , " and shake his head and point to his fist . <p> And if I answered one , he 'd point to his absence of raised fingers and say zero . Then we 'd argue . <p> To silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most prolific mother , I was born with an appreciation for numbers ! I 'd grown up literally counting sheep ! ! knew just how high numbers were able to climb ! <p> But Gaetanu would refuse to listen to me . He 'd repeat the contradiction of his raised fist and his justification that one plus zero equaled zero , claiming that these additions explained how he had journeyed all this way and had still gotten nowhere and was in fact even more poor now than he 'd been before . <p> No one could argue against that conclusion . In truth , after the first year he was in an even deeper hole of debt to the patruni . <p> One hot summer night as we lay in bed discussing these arithmetics , the air grew so thick and heavy it was a great labor just to take the next breath . Neither of us could sleep . The humid night stretched itself endlessly before us . We tossed on the mattress until his hands happened to brush against my hips . He was arguing with me about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , that no number could ascend higher than ten because ten tumbled back to zero before it could possibly reach the height of elevenness and as a result might as well be merely one , so that at the second he touched my hips , the fingers of both his hands were stretched forward . <p> Then a bolt of lightning shot through the sky , transforming the inky darkness into a clear moment of day . A cool wind surged through the room . A curtain of rain smacked the street below our window with a steady shhhhhhh , and darkness mercifully fell again over us as his ten fingers drifted from my hips toward the front of my pantaloons . <p> " Tell me your name , " he whispered in the darkness . I could barely hear him , the rain was pounding the roof with such force . " Your name , " he said in a deeper voice . " Tell me your true and real woman 's name . " <p> The lightning bolt had transformed him into a bull . I stroked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt my hands against his sharp , upturned horns . <p> He scrambled from the bed and stood , pawing the floor with his front hoof , then stretched back the bulk of his powerful neck and bellowed loudly in the night . <p> As I changed myself back into a woman , I told him all he needed to know . <p> <p> By TONY ARDIZZONE <p>
