Flipping the last page of the decision he had been reading , Sam Pope rose from his chair took a deep , satisfied breath , and let it out in a sigh of intense pleasure . He twitched his mustache en route to a smile . The smile broadened . He straightened his shoulders , felt his chest fill with excitement . Unable to contain himself , he growled an exuberant , " Way to go , Sam , " and strode out the door . " We did it , Joy , " he said without breaking stride . His secretary 's eyes lit . " That explains the media . " Even as she held out pink slips for the phone calls Sam had refused to take while he was reading the decision , her phone buzzed again . But Sam was off , heading down the hall . There was a spring in his step . He felt on top of the world . He passed office after office but did n't slow until he reached the one at the very end . He wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news . John David Maxwell was his oldest and closest friend . The office was empty . " He 's at Continental Life in Springfield for the day , " his secretary called from her station . Samfelt a moment 's disappointment , but it was gone in a flash . He was too elated to be weighed down for long . " When he calls in , tell him we won Dann v. Hanover . " The secretary grinned . " He 'll be thrilled . What a victory . " " Yeah , " Sam said , and tossed his chin toward yet another corridor . At its far end was a large corner office with generous views of the State House , the Boston Common , and the Public Garden . It was the office of the founder of the firm , the senior Maxwell . " Is John Stewart around ? " " He 's in New York for board meetings . But he 'll be impressed . " As he should be , Sam thought . Twelve years before , John Stewart had n't wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom line , as J.S. seemed to think , this justified it . No one could sneeze at a contingency fee of a cool six million . Striding back down the hall , he knew he looked smug , but he did n't care . He stopped at the office two short doors from his own and rapped a hand on the jamb . Vicki Cornell was the associate who , over four years ' time , had worked most closely with him taking Dunn v. Hanover from the Superior Court to the Appellate Court to the Supreme Judicial Court . One look at Sam 's face and she grew wide-eyed . " Yes ? " He grinned and nodded . She let out a whoop . It had barely left her mouth when she was on her feet and at the door , extending a hand in congratulations . Sam threw political correctness to the winds and gave her a hug . She did n't seem to mind . Stepping back , she looked as excited about the victory as he was . " We did it . Wow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He nodded . " It 's on my desk . " " Does Marilyn Dunn know ? " " And the others . They 're coming in at three for a press conference . Do me a favor and call Sybil Howard ? Channel Five has given us good coverage along the way . I want Sybil to have first dibs on questions . And call Locke-Ober 's . Let 's book a private room . " He turned to leave . " Have your husband join us . And Tom and Alex , and the significant others we kept them from while they were working on this case . " On his way out the door he said , " We 've earned a celebration . It is n't every day that precedent-setting cases are won . " To Joy , in passing , he said , " See you in a couple of hours . " " Where will you be ? " " At home . Or at the college . Wherever I find my wife . " He had no intention of telling Annie the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Winning Dunn v. Hanover was a coup . He had to see her face to face , had to hold her . No celebration would be complete without that . Constance-on-the-Rise lay eighteen miles northwest of Boston . It was an intimate , affluent community nity whose luxury imports normally made the commute to the city in forty minutes . Sam did it in ten better than that . Granted , it was eleven in the morning , rather than the rush hour . But he breezed road repair crews without braking once . He , was on a roll . All his life he had dreamed of doing something important , scoring points for the little guy , making a difference . As an assistant district attorney he had prosecuted some heavy murder and drug cases , but none could hold a candle to Dunn v. Hanover . Annie knew that . Annie understood . He was really on a roll , because it just so happened that Tuesday was her work-at-home day . She would be all alone  --  no offspring , no friends . She would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  until she heard his news . Then she would be beside herself with excitement . She always was when there was good news to share . He recalled other good news times . When his law school acceptance had come in the mail , he had scoured the library , finally finding her in a remote carrel , squirreling her into a nearby storage room , and making love to her with his back to the door . On the evening he 'd won his law school moot court competition , they had done it in his car . When he 'd learned he had passed the bar , they had run to the inn adjacent to the college where Anniewas taking graduate courses . Their room had been harming , all two hours ' worth . Nine months later Jonathan had been born . He drove with a smile on his face and an ache in his groin , both of which burgeoned when he pulled up the circular drive to the front door of the brick Tudor . Flushed with anticipation , he swung out of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . " Annie ? Good news , sunshine ! " He took the steps two at a time to the second floor , then her third-floor office . This time of day the sun would be spilling through the skylights and across her desk . He had visions of making love there . " Annie ? " She was n't in her office , though her briefcase was open and the desk covered with papers . He searched the second floor , then the first , calling her name repeatedly . When he checked the garage , he saw that her car was gone . Continues ...
