txt 100 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s Before deciding on a comfort rating , try to determine the range of temperatures in which you will most often be hiking . If you intend to do a lot of cold-weather camping , you 'll probably want a bag rated between zero and twenty degrees . What if your hiking will take you through both cold and hot weather ? You may want to buy a 20-degree bag and a bag liner , which can raise your bag 's temperature by as much as fifteen degrees . Of course , if money is no object , you may prefer to buy several bags with ratings ranging from zero to forty-five degrees or so . A 20-degree bag is adequate for three-season camping unless you live in Alaska . But if you get cold easily , a 20-degree bag may be a bit chilly when the temperature dips below freezing . It is better to buy a warmer bag ( or at least , a bag liner or overbag ) than to face a 20-mile day after a cold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your bag , you can always sleep on top of it ! On hypothermic days , a sleeping bag may save your life . Some people choose to cut down their backpack weight by carrying a blanket ( and in one case we know of , a table cloth ) instead of a sleeping bag . Whether hiking on the west coast , east coast or anywhere in between , it is unwise to forfeit your sleeping bag for the sake of weight . Any meteorologist will admit that weather is unpredictable , seemingly changing at whim from hot and muggy to cold and stormy within twentyfour hours . During our backpacking career , we have had both our coldest and hottest days in Pennsylvania in June . We definitely recommend that you purchase a sleeping bag , even if you only intend to make overnight trips . It could be the difference between life and death . Fillings There are only six fillings to consider when purchasing a bag for backpacking . They are the lightest and warmest to be found on the market currently : Quallofil , Hollofil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Primaloft and down . One thing that will influence your decision when choosing a fill is what happens to that fill when it gets wet . Once again , your choice will be a question of preference . Quallofil : The fibers of this polyester filling are hollow , each with four microscopic tubes that allow for good insulating ability and more surface area . Quallofil , which is as soft as down , is non-allergenic , and retains most of its loft when wet . ( Loft is the thickness of the filling . ) So , when Quallofil gets wet it does n't become thin and hard or lose its warmth . Hollofil : Also polyester , Hollofil fibers are about two inches long and must be sewn to another backing to prevent clumping ; this leads to cold spots in a sleeping bag . Similar to Quallofil , Hollofil has a single hole in the fiber ; but it allows for more " air " per ounce and thus provides more insulation . The added insulation is gained at a price because the backing materials used for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollofil loses only about a tenth of its warmth 102 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s #@# #@# Hiking Tip ( ( ( ( Keep yourself warm in your sleeping bag by wearing a hat , drinking plenty of fluids , and warming yourself up before climbing in . A hat retains heat lost from the head , dehydration inhibits your body 's ability to warm itself , and a quick stroll or a few jumping jacks will provide your sleeping bag with some heat to retain . when wet . The new Hollofil II has silicone added to make the fibers easier to compress and the bag , therefore , easier to fit into a stuff sack . Polarguard HV : Polarguard HV is a continuous filament . The fibers , which are long and interwoven , do n't become matted , which eliminates the need for a backing to prevent cold spots . Polarguard 1W also retains its loft ? thus its warmth , when wet . The new Polarguard HV is 20 percent warmer than the old Polarguard for the same weight . Lite Loft : Thinsulate Lite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its weight . Its microfine polyester/olefin fibers make it lightweight , even when wet , and easily compressible . Microloft : This is the latest from Du Pont . Microloft boasts the smallest of the micro fibers . These tiny fibers enable Microloft to trap more heat and remain soft and supple . Primaloft : It mimics the structure of goose down with tiny fibers interspersed with stiffer fibers . Unlike down , Primaloft is water repellent and retains its warmth when wet . Down : Down has long been lauded and is still number one when it comes to providing maximum warmth and comfort for Sleeping Bags ? 103 minimum weight and bulk . Down sleeping bags breathe better than polyester fiber bags and are less stifling in warmer temperatures than their synthetic counterparts . But when a down bag gets wet , it loses almost all of its warmth and gains much more in weight than synthetic bags . Down bags also mat and clump worse than synthetic bags . Down bags are notoriously bad for hay-fever-sufferers . If you 're allergic to feather pillows , you 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down are used as fillings with the difference discernible only under a microscope . But , goose down is generally considered structurally superior . The fill power or loft of down is measured in cubic inches and simply represents the number of cubic inches one ounce of down will expand to in a twenty-four hour period . For example , 600 cubic inches is considered to be a superior loft , 500-550 is very good , and so on . That infamous tag ( Do not remove ... ) called the bedding or law tag will inform you of the bag 's loft . By the way , the consumer is allowed to remove the law tag once the product has been purchased . According to tests conducted by Recreational Equipment Incorporated ( REI ) , " a synthetic bag will lose about ten percent of its warmth while gaining about sixty percent in weight " when the sleeping bag gets wet . Conversely , they said a water-soaked , down-filled bag " will lose over 90 percent of its warmth , gain 128 percent in weight and take more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that your ability to keep a down bag dry is a major factor when deciding to purchase a bag . All six fillings have strong proponents . When purchasing a bag , decide how much trouble you want to go through to keep your bag dry . Stuffing your sleeping bag into a plastic garbage bag before putting it in a stuff sack will keep it dryer . And if you will be fording a stream or are expecting hard rains , put the stuff sack into another bag for extra protection . A few companies ? Feathered Friends , Gold-Eck of Aus104 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s tria and Wiggy 's Inc. ? make their own synthetic fibers to fill their bags . These fibers are all similar in merit to the six listed above . Down bags are clearly a favorite with hikers but they may lose ground to the new synthetics ? Lite Loft and Primaloftthat are designed in the image of down without its failings . Weight The lighter your bag the better . Unfortunately , the lighter the bag , the more it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that weighs more than five pounds . A bag in the two to four pound range is probably your best bet for cost-efficiency and warmth . Weight is related to the comfort rating and the filling . Usually , the lower the comfort rating , the more the bag weighs . Fillings other than the six mentioned above weigh a lot more than you 'll be willing to carry , even on overnight trips . Keep in mind that it is likely that the bag you buy will eventually get wet , and that will increase its weight somewhat . Shape Sleeping bags come in three basic shapes ? mummy , rectangular and semi-rectangular . Most backpackers choose the mummy-shaped bag because it offers the most warmth and space for the least weight . Most bags offer what is called a draft tube behind the zipper to prevent air from leaking into the bag . If you intend to use your bag in windy or even cool weather be sure that the bag you choose has a draft tube . Mummy : The name describes the shape . Formed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of air to warm and takes less material to make ( and , therefore , to stuff ) This saves on weight as well . The mummy 's " head " is designed to draw down over and around your own on cold Sleeping Bags ? 105 nights , limiting your body 's heat loss . Most mummy bags also feature a " boxed " foot section which keeps the insulation in place over your feet so that they stay warmer . But like everything , the mummy has its drawbacks . There is absolutely no room to turn around in it . You either toss and turn the entire bag or sleep in one position through the night . Also , the short zippers hamper ventilation . Rectangular : This is the roomiest and the heaviest of sleeping bags . Three sides of the bag are zippered allowing you to ventilate to the point of making the bag a blanket . Room and ventilation become the bag 's drawbacks on cold nights because there is more air to heat up and no hood to prevent heat from escaping through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag without the hood , this design saves some on weight , provides good ventilation because it , too , is zippered on three sides , and has a bit less air to heat up . Like the rectangular bag , there is no hood for cold nights . When purchasing a sleeping bag , make sure it fits . A bag that is too narrow or too short will affect the quality of your sleep . Because a mummy bag follows the contours of your body , make sure that it is not too tight in the shoulders and around your head . If you are planning extended backpacking and/or cold weather trips , you may want to buy a bag with extra room at the feet . The extra room will accommodate water bottles , boots , socks or any other things you may want to keep from freezing . Shells Another important consideration when buying a bag is the shell or outer covering . Although there are numerous materials to choose from , you will want to consider only shells I ! 106 ? Backpacking in the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabrics . Ripstop nylon : This material features heavier threads interwoven in the fabric every quarter inch or so to prevent rips from running down the bag . It also forms a web of reinforcement to reduce stress . Strong for its weight , ripstop nylon is also wind resistant . On the other hand , it does not repel water and therefore gets wet easily ? although it dries quickly . Nylon taffeta : This flat-weave fabric is softer than ripstop but is n't as strong or as resistant to wind . It , too , gets wet easily . Nylon taffeta is often used as an inner lining . Waterproof/breathable fabrics : These are being used more and more as shells because they ventilate better than other fabrics and repel water . Brand names such as Gore-Tex and VersaTech are the more popular waterproof/water resistant products . Microfiber fabrics , which feature a super tight weave that repels water , are also gaining in popularity . No bag is truly waterproof , but these fabrics will keep fillings dry in a tent and are often wind-resistant enough to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following is a list of some of the many sleeping bag manufacturers : Bibler Tents ; Boulder Designs ; Caribou Mountaineering , Inc. ; Down to Earth/Liberty Mountain Sports ; Eastern Mountain Sports ; Envirogear , Ltd. ; Feathered Friends ; Gold-Eck of Austria ; Integral Designs ; Invicta/Uvex Sports , Inc. ; Kelty Pack , Inc. ; L.L.

Caring For Your Bag Synthetic sleeping bags can be washed by hand or in a commercial washer with warm or cold water . They should be cleaned with a mild soap such as Ivory , and , if not air dried , they should be dried at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any bag , make sure it is well supported . Never hang it by one end because the weight of the wet filling may tear out the inner construction and ruin the bag . Supporting the bag on a slanted board is a good option . Down sleeping bags should be hand washed . If washed in a machine , your bag could lose its loft because the detergent breaks down the natural oils of the goose down . Down bags should not be dried in a household dryer ; rather , they should be drip dried for several days . The bag can then be placed in a commercial dryer on low heat to fluff it . Throwing in a clean pair of tennis shoes will break up matted down . Sleeping bags should not be stored in the tiny stuff sacks that they are normally carried in on a hike . A big , loose bag is the best container for keeping your bag in good condition when you 're not on the trail . Stuffing your bag into a small sack every day while hiking is all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if you store it that way at home , the filling becomes packed together and it is hard to restore its loft . Never roll your bag up neatly because this compresses the insulation . Stuffing the bag into its sack assures you of a different pattern of compression each day , which is better on the loft . Another way to increase the life of your bag is to wash up 108 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s each night before crawling into it . The dirt and oil on your clothes and body will find its way into your bag 's fill and inhibit its ability to insulate . If you ca n't wash up , change into clean clothes . Mated Bags For couples interested in hiking , some sleeping bags may be zipped together . Many sleeping bag manufacturers offer bags with right and left zippers . If you intend to buy mateable bags , you may want to consider one lightweight ( approximately 40-degree ) and one heavier ( about 20-degree ) bag . That way , if it 's warm , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bag Liners Purchasing a bag liner is a good way to warm up your bag without adding much cost or weight . There are three types of bag liners ? overbags , vapor barriers , and plain inner liners . Overbags : The overbags slide on over your sleeping bag and have a filling that increases the warmth of your bag by as much as twenty degrees . They cost approximately $50 to $100 and weigh about two to three pounds ? kind of bulky for extensive backpacking but not too bad for short , cold-weather trips . Vapor barriers : These liners are inserted inside your sleeping bag and can raise its temperature by as much as fifteen degrees . Basically , with the vapor barrier , you 're sticking yourself inside a plastic bag . They are constructed out of coated nylon or other materials and weigh only five to six ounces . Also , they cost much less than the overbags ? approximately $20 to $30 a bag . The drawback to the vapor barrier is comfort ; they are designed to make you sweat and use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are recommended for temperatures well below freezing . // ' Hiking Secret Use your sleeping bag as a cooler on hot days by inserting already cooled soft drinks or water into the middle of your bag . The liquid will stay cold for several hours . Plain inner liners : You can also purchase simple bag liners made of flannel , cotton , breathable nylon , synthetics , and down costing anywhere from $5 to $100 and weighing three ounces to two pounds . The degree to which they warm your bag varies and should be clarified by the salesperson before you decide to purchase such a liner . Sleeping Pads Sleeping pads are a necessity . If you do n't sleep on a pad , you lose all your heat to the ground . Although the padding is minimal , they are more comfortable than the hard earth . The two sleeping pads favored by hikers are the Therma-Rest and the Ridgerest . The Therm-a-Rest is a self-inflating pad that can be purchased in three-quarters or full length . It is the overwhelming favorite among hikers , although it weighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three-quarters length pad sufficient for their comfort . The pads range in weight from just over a pound to close to 4.5 pounds . Prices range from $40 to $100 . The Therm-a-Rest is an open-cell foam pad with a nylon cover and is available with a repair kit . A " couples kit " also can be purchased for the Therm-aRest that allows two pads to be joined together . It is simply two nylon tarps that hold the pads so that they do not move around during the night . The Ridgerest , although less popular among hikers we know , was awarded Backpacker magazine 's product design award . It , too , can be purchased in three-quarters and full lengths . Both the three-quarters and the full-length pads 110 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s weigh under a pound and cost less than $20 . The " ridges " in the Ridgerest were designed to trap air to keep you warmer . It is a closed-cell foam pad . Also available are three other pads : the Equalizer , a selfinflating mattress by Basic Designs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporation ; and the Easy Nite comfort pad by Foam Design Consumer Products , Inc . The Equalizer is a bit heavy for most backpacking trips , weighing more than two pounds and costing more than $50 . The Easy Nite weighs less than a pound and is less expensive . Other options include the blue foam pads available at most camping stores and other foam pads . These pads weigh anywhere from eight ounces to one pound and can be purchased in the $10 to $15 range . ? 7 ? Boots PLANNING FOR TWO MONTHS of trekking in Nepal was not easy . As a novice backpacker , I had absolutely no idea what type of boots I needed for the rough terrain . Although we were n't planning on snow or ice hiking , I wanted something heavy enough to support my sprain-prone ankles yet light enough that I did n't feel I was carrying around lead weights on my feet . I was too naive to realize that boots had to be tried on , fitted and broken in . I ordered a pair of Raichle Ecolites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blister suffered I , and the boots lasted me more than 2,000 miles . They carried me through two months of trekking in Nepal , and later through Georgia , north to Massachusetts on the Appalachian Trail . The second time I pulled this stunt I was n't so lucky . Even though the lightweight boots I purchased were reputed to be easy to break in , I still experienced some painful blisters . A bit of moleskin cleared them up in a few days , but some unlucky hikers get blisters so badly they have to go to the hospital for treatment . Almost every hiker can tell you a boot story ? from dissolving uppers and disappearing soles to swamp rot and ulcerous 114 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s them on before you buy them , or purchase them through a mail-order house with a liberal return policy . Heavyweight Boots Heavyweight boots usually weigh more than four pounds and cost more than $200 ( as always , there are exceptions ) . They are designed for technically demanding hiking such as on ice with crampons or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thicker , stiffer leather than mediumweights , and sometimes of molded plastic . They have close-trimmed soles and a half- to full-length steel shank in the sole . Some heavyweight boots offer a padded , insulated inner boot for protection against the extreme temperatures involved in mountaineering . Boot Manufacturers There are many manufacturers of hiking boots and prices can range from less than $50 ( inexpensive ) to more than $400 ( expensive ) . The following is a list of some of the many boot manufacturers : Adidas USA , Inc. ; Alico Sport ; Alpina Sports USA ; Asolo/Kenko International , Inc. ; Coleman Footgear/ Wolverine Worldwide Inc. ; Danner Shoe MFG . Co. ; Dunham ; Fabiano Shoe Co. , Inc. ; Five Ten ; Georgia Boot Inc. ; H.H. Brown Shoe Company ; Hi-Tec Sports USA , Inc. ; K-Swiss ; La Sportiva USA ; Limmer Boots ( custom-made boots ) ; Lowa USA ; Merrell Footwear ; New Balance Athletic Shoe , Inc. ; Nike ; One Sport/Brenco Enterprises , Inc. ; Raichle Molitor USA , Inc. ; Reebok International Limited ; The Rockport Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Inc. ; Tecnica USA ; The Timberland Company ; Trezeta/Climb High ; Vasque ; Vertical Footwear . Uppers There are four types of uppers ? or the portion of the boot above the sole ? including leather , fabric/leather , Gore-Tex and plastic . Because of its support , breathability , comfort , protectiveness and ability to be waterproofed , leather is most often used when constructing uppers . The highest quality boots feature an all-leather upper because there is less stitching for water to leak through and fewer seams to burst . Multiple-piece leather uppers are your next best option because they cost less than all-leathers and can be waterproofed . Fabric/leather uppers reinforce canvas or nylon with pieces of leather to help the boots resist abrasion and to increase support . Only the leather pieces can be waterproofed because the fabrics will not take waterproofing treatments . Some boots offer a Gore-Tex liner between the upper and the outer lining . Because the stitching in the upper does not penetrate the Gore-Tex , the boots provide more protection against wetness . Uppers made of plastic are used only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong and Boots - 117 waterproof , plastic uppers are too rigid for most terrains . Uppers also include cuffs or scree collars that are stitched to the ankle top of most boots to provide some protection against the inevitable invasion of pebbles and twigs . Internal cuffs are better than external because they last longer . The tongue of the boot should be gussetted for the best protection against moisture and debris . The gusset is a thin piece of leather or other material sewn between the boot upper and tongue . The best protection is found in a bellows tongue , which has a full-length gusset that covers the entire tongue opening . Overlapping tongues also provide a nearly water-tight closure . Well-padded tongues are more comfortable , offering some protection against tightly laced boots . The protective piece of leather sewn over the back seam of most boots is called the backstay . Because it is next to impossible to replace , look for a backstay that is narrow . It will be less vulnerable to abrasion . Toe and heel counters are also part of a well-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heel areas to provide some protection against rocks and roots . Soles The outsole , midsole and steel shank make up the sole of the boot . The outsole , often a Vibram brand these days , usually has either shallow or deep lugs to provide traction . Good traction is particularly important if you intend to do some rock scrambling or if you will be gaining and losing a lot of elevation while carrying a heavy pack . While shallow lugs are designed for easy to moderate terrain and are usually paired with lightweight boots , deeper lugs can be found on mediumweight and heavyweight boots and provide the traction needed for most backpacking trips . Between the outsole and insole of the boot is the midsole . The thickness of the midsole varies with the boot but is 118 - Backpacking in the ' 90s designed to provide extra protection , extra support , and cushioning between your foot and the ground . Even lightweight boots feature a midsole , often of EVA or polyurethane , for added comfort . Most boots have a steel ( or plastic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexes at the ball of your foot . Except for plastic boots , which have an inherently rigid sole , shanks range in length from a quarter- to full-length . The lightweight boots usually require only up to a half-length shank while the mediumweight to heavyweight boots need at least a half- to full-length shank for optimum rigidity . Leather There are several different methods used to cure the leather that makes up the hundreds of boots designed for hiking , backpacking and mountaineering . Tanning immediately comes to mind . This is curing leather by placing hides in a rotating drum containing a solution of chromium sulfate . It is called chrome tanning , and all leather undergoes this first process . Some leathers then undergo a vegetable process that involves tanning with plant derivatives . This step gives the leather extra body and solidity . Some leathers are put through a step called fatliquoring in which the leather is cured with either oils to make it softer , or waxes to make it firmer . Hide straight off the cow is too thick for even the heaviest of boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Full-grain leather , the outside layer of the hide , is the highest quality leather  --  resistant to abrasion , the most waterproof and the stiffest . All others layers are called " splits " . Quality of splits varies but only the layer beneath the full-grain can be used in boots and it must be specially treated to make it resistent to water . Most manufacturers use full-grain leather in their uppers . Because of the battering hiking boots receive , many Boots ? 119 #@# #@# Hiking Tip ( ( ( ( Spray the inside of your boots with a fungicide to prevent boot rot and bad odor. manufacturers will turn the full-grain leather inside out before stitching it to the sole . This way , the water resistant side is facing inward and is less likely to receive nicks and scratches from rocks and roots that will allow water to seep into your boot . How can you tell which way the full-grain is facing ? The outside of the boot will be smooth if the top layer is out , rough if the top layer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top layer facing out . The Welt The importance of the welt ( or how the upper is fastened to the sole ) never occurred to me until Frank lost the soles of his New Balance Cascades outside of Elk Park , North Carolina . Hiking sixty miles to the next town with his soles duct-taped to his uppers was pure torture , but what if a friendly hiker had n't had the tape ? A bare-footed jaunt to the next road carrying a forty pound pack was unthinkable . . . so , a plug for carrying duct tape ( probably one of the better modern inventions along with WD-40 ? just ask MacGyver ) and a strong suggestion to check out the welt on the boots you plan to hike in . It is usually accomplished with stitching and/or cement and affects both the strength and flexibility of the boot . The Goodyear welt is accomplished with two rows of stitching . A horizontal stitch joins the upper to both the insole and a strip of leather . This strip of leather is then vertically stitched to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in lightweight hiking boots . Both the outer and midsole can be replaced on boots using this welt . The Norwegian welt also uses two rows of stitching ? a 120 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s horizontal stitch to join the upper and lining to the insole and a vertical stitch to attach the upper to the midsole . While not as flexible as the Goodyear welt , the Norwegian welt is much stronger and is often used in mediumweight and heavyweight boots . Outer and midsoles can also be replaced on this boot . Another type of welt is called the " inside fastened " , the " Littleway " or the " McKay " . This welt is achieved by rolling the upper between the insole and midsole and then stitching all three together from the inside . This is both a flexible and durable welt method and is often used on lightweight hiking boots . Like the other methods , both the outer and midsoles can be replaced . Because they are not intended for heavy use , lightweight boots often have cement-welted soles . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Advances in technology have produced strong adhesives , but boots with soles that are attached with an epoxy take a bit of extra care ( i.e. , common sense ) . Do n't dry them out too close to a heat source because the epoxy could melt and a few miles down the trail , the sole could separate from the upper . Fit Select your boot carefully . Backpacking is an activity that often involves spending the entire day on your feet as well as putting an extraordinary amount of weight on them . The strongest welt , toughest leather and super-traction soles will mean little if every step is agonizing because of improper fit . You may be proud of your small , shapely feet , but buying a boot because it enhances your appearance is foolish and may amount to a face lined with anguish by day 's end . Boot sizing is notorious for its inconsistency . You might normally wear a size 6 in tennis shoes but a 5 or a 7 in a boot . Make sure that the boots are not only long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this technique for selecting the proper boot size . With the boot unlaced , slide your foot to the front of the boot . If you can just slide two fingers in between your heel and the boot the fit should be right . It will allow the little extra room you need without giving too much play . wide enough as well . A number of boots come in several widths : find the one that 's right for you . The most important thing when purchasing a boot is whether or not it is comfortable . When trying on the boot , wear hiking socks . A boot might feel comfy over a thin cotton crew , but slip it on over a thick polypropylene and suddenly your foot feels like a sardine . Also , if you intend to wear insoles , which give you extra cushioning and arch support , bring them along when you are trying on boots because insoles also affect the way a boot fits . How do you know if the fit is big enough but not too big ? Is there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your boot ? Can you wiggle your toes for good circulation ? Take all the time you need to get a good fit . While my first pair of boots did n't give me blisters , they were too short . On the downhill , my feet slid forward into the toe of the boot , resulting in painfully numb toes that throbbed all night long . Not even aspirin could dim that pain . Long distance hikers often lose toenails . A boot that is long enough will help alleviate that problem . On the other hand , make sure your heel does n't slip . This could lead to blisters . The heel should be snug but it should n't pinch you . Lace your boots up securely . Is there any part of the boot that is uncomfortable ? Pressure should be even all over your foot , which contains more than 26 functional bones . Tell the salesperson what you feel . Is there unusual pressure at the 122 - Backpacking in the ' 90s instep ? Let him or her know . They 'll probably suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't be surprised if you ca n't find a perfect fit . With more than 132 potential foot shapes , no manufacturer can fit everyone . Once you 've found the next best thing to perfect , the boot can probably be altered with orthotics and broken in to fit . Waterproofing If your boots have any leather in their construction , they need waterproofing . Sno-Seal , and the newer Aquaseal , are two popular brands of sealant although there are a number of others . Devoutly follow directions for the waterproofer you purchase . It really does help to have dry feet ! Unfortunately , sealing your boots is not a one-time deal . It must be done periodically ; and the more you use your boots , the more often you must seal them . For hikes of more than a week or two , you may want to carry sealant along with you . Or send some ahead if you plan to have mail drops . Taking care of your boots will ensure a longer lifespan ( for your boots , that is ) . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storing . If your boots are wet , try stuffing them with newspaper to soak up the inside moisture and let them dry in a cool , dry place . Do n't try to dry them quickly by setting them near a heater , oven or open flame . It could mean the death of your boots . Once they are dry , reseal them with waterproofer . Seams and welts and the leather used in lightweight boots require a special sealant . All boot sealants can be purchased in outdoors stores . Breaking in Your Boots The single most important advice when it comes to boots is " break them in . " Any experienced hiker will tell you ( and it certainly can not be stressed enough ) that boots must be Boots ? 123 broken in if you intend to hike more than a mile or two in them . Once you find a pair of boots that fit comfortably and you have sealed them properly , it 's time to break them in . Start by walking around your neighborhood . Wear them to the store and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blister , put moleskin on it immediately ? do n't wait . If you catch a hot spot before it becomes a blister , you 'll save yourself a lot of pain . The next step is a day hike . Wear your boots for an entire day without a pack on your back . If this goes well , you 're ready for the final step ? backpacking . If not , continue to day-hike until the boots are comfortable . If you intend to use these boots only for day-hiking , you will want to try hiking with a day pack to see if they are still comfortable with weight on your back . If they are , your boots need no further breaking in . Backpacking requires more breaking in . No matter how comfortable your boots are without a pack , that all could change once you add thirty or more pounds to your back . A lot of weight on your back changes the way weight is distributed over your feet and it could change the way your feet feel in your boots . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a long day . Suddenly , it feels as if you 're walking on air . If you can backpack five to ten miles in your boots without creating any sore spots , your boots are ready for extensive backpacking . Inserts Some hikers find that they can make their boots more comfortable , and more supportive , by adding special insoles . Also , the insoles and arch supports that come with your boots begin to wear down after a while . Adding insoles that provide additional arch support can extend the life ( and comfort ) of 124 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s your boots . They can also provide extra warmth and insulation . Insoles for boots can be purchased at most outfitters or department , discount , and drug stores . Extra Shoes Should you carry an extra pair of shoes with you when you hike ? Well , that all depends on the distance you 're hiking . For day trips , you probably do n't need an extra pair of shoes , especially if you 're wearing lightweight boots . Weekenders must decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short trip . It really is a matter of preference . Some people ca n't stand to be in boots once they 've made camp . If you are going to be out for more than a few days , you need to seriously consider additional footwear . We 've seen all kinds carried ? tennis shoes , espadrilles , flip flops , Nike Aqua Socks , sandals . There are a number of reasons to carry additional footwear . Picture this typical scenario : You 've been hiking all day in the rain ; your boots are soaked , your socks are soaked . You arrive at your campsite , make camp , and prepare to bed down . Keep in mind that this entire time you 've been sloshing around in wet boots . Because you 're no longer hiking , your feet are getting cold . Then , when you 're all cuddled up in your nice , warm sleeping bag . . . nature calls . Do you really want to put those freezing cold , damp boots on your feet just to make a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful , warm and sunny day and you have to ford a stream . There are very few times when you have the option to remove your boots and cross barefooted because of sharp and slick rocks . On the other hand , you do n't really want to get your boots wet either . A second pair of shoes is a great alternative in this case . Also , hiking boots are tough on campsites . Another pair of shoes ( soft-soled ) is an ecologically sound alternative . If Boots ? 125 you 're hiking long distance , it is not unusual to wear a spare pair of shoes into town to purchase food , wash clothes , etc . And because many trails are not entirely routed in the woods , you may want to wear another pair of shoes on road walks . Asphalt wears down the tread on hiking boots . These are all good reasons to bring along a second pair of shoes . But choose wisely : the last thing you need is an extra burden . Laces and Lacing While leather laces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet has been their demise . Nylon has replaced them as the standard lace for hiking boots . The durable , softwoven , unwaxed nylon laces also hold knots best . Hiking boots usually feature three different methods of closure ? grommets , D-rings and hooks . Lacing using only grommets is probably the sturdiest ; grommets usually last well past the lifetime of the boot . The only problem with an allgrommet boot is that it can be difficult to lace , particularly when your hands are blocks of ice . Many boots have grommets in the lower half of the boot and hooks at the top . My boots have D-rings on the lower half and hooks above . They are very easy to lace , even with numb fingers ( it 's the knot I have trouble with when I ca n't even feel the laces ) . There are a few tips to keep in mind when lacing your boots . If the upper knot of your boot rubs against your shin , lace your boots to the top then back down a few notches and tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bruise . Another advantage of this method is that it keeps the knot from loosening under the pressure of your constantly bending ankle . If your toes are feeling cramped , try loosening up the lower laces a bit , tie a knot , and continue lacing the boot tightly . Although this wo n't work on the downhill because the 126 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s Hiking Secret If you are having trouble keeping your feet warm when the temperature drops below freezing , try a vapor barrier . A plastic bag , such as the resealable ones used for packing food , can trap moisture and thus prevent heat from escaping . Place your socked foot into the plastic bag and then slide the bag-wrapped foot into your boot . While not fashionable , it is cozy . loose laces will cause your toes to slide painfully into the front of your boot . In this case , you might want to try the opposite approach . Socks It used to be that you needed to wear several pairs of socks with your hiking boots just to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , all you really need is a pair of liner socks and a pair of hiking socks . Liners are important . They wick away the perspiration and help keep your feet dry . Liners are made of silk , nylon , polypropylene , Thermax , or orlon . Keep your liners clean . At least rinse them out often so that they do n't " clog up . " Socks can be hung out to dry on the back of your pack . ( You can use clothespins or safety pins to fasten drying clothes to the back of your pack . ) Choose your outer pair of socks wisely . Most experts suggest a blend of wool and nylon or wool and polypropylene . Cotton is never suggested because , unlike wool , it will not keep you warm when it 's wet . Some socks are made with added padding at the toe and heel as well as extra arch support . These socks are usually a **25;64;TOOLONG blend ; liners are not necessary with them . Try several brands and find out what 's right for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socks retained too much foot odor for my taste . Frank had absolutely no complaints with his wool-polypropylene blend . Footcare Hardening your feet before setting out on a hiking trip is not an easily accomplished task . There is nothing like carrying a thirty to sixty pound pack to quickly break your feet in . But there are some things you can do to make the transition a little easier . Besides wearing your boots as often as possible before you set out on a backpacking trek , rubbing your feet each day with rubbing alcohol or tincture of benzoin for a week prior to your trip will help toughen them up . While backpacking , continue to use the alcohol or benzoin each day on your feet . Airing your feet out during breaks will also help keep them tough as will sprinkling your socks with foot powder prior to putting them on . And most importantly , do n't forget that as soon as you feel a hot spot on your foot cover it with moleskin ! ? 8 ? Clothing WHILE BACKPACKING in the mountains of N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snow storm . Fortunately , we were prepared . what the expected weather , I always carry a wool s long johns in my backpack . They 've paid off count We were nice and comfy in our wool and silk , an down in our sleeping bags , but a youth group who old barn with us was almost hypothermic . A heavy rain originally drove us into the rickei When the rain did n't let up by late afternoon , we stay for the night . It was n't long before the youth g straggling in . Clad in jeans and t-shirts , the already shivering when they entered the barn . It were wise enough to get them out of their wet clod their sleeping bags . As dusk darkened the interior the leaders finished hanging the last of the jeans a Soon everyone settled down , rocked to sleep by th swayed back and forth in the gusting wind . As w snow storm blew in . We awoke to find ourselves c snow , the barn decorated with frozen clothes . T cotton ! 130 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton is the perfect fabric ? backpacking is n't one of them . Unlike wool , cotton does not retain heat when wet . Unlike synthetics , it takes forever to dry . Faced with jeans and t-shirts not even a snowman could wear , the youth group tried in vain to start a fire to thaw the clothes . Finally , tents went up in the frozen barn and clothes were pulled into the warmth . The group eventually donned their damp , but no longer frozen , clothes for the chilling five-mile hike through a foot of snow to the nearest road . Better equipped and wearing everything from long johns to rain gear , we continued our hike northward . The ability to layer clothes when backpacking can be a lifesaver . The type of clothing you wear will virtually determine the comfort of your hike . Although the exertion of hiking warms your body , I 've found myself hiking in long johns and a wool sweater on a barrier island off the coast of Florida in May . Clothing is undoubtedly a matter of personal preference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of frustration . The most important tip is the famous Boy Scout creed ? " be prepared " . You do not have to carry a backpack full of clothes to be prepared for all types of weather . Shorts , t-shirt , long johns , wool sweater and rain gear can all be layered to add warmth . Hiking through the low desert on the Pacific Crest Trail in southern California is akin to a walk in hell . It is hard to stay cool even in shorts and a t-shirt . But when the sun drops below the horizon , it does n't take long for things to cool off and you 'll actually relish the warmth of your sleeping bag ! You 'll find yourself adding pants or long johns . There are even times when a wool sweater would be in order . Europeans often express shock at the American penchant for clothes . The late French film director Francois Truffaut once remarked that he could not believe Mrs. Dean wore a different outfit every day of the Watergate trial . How could Clothing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man whose wife could afford so much clothing . We are notorious for our over abundance of luggage when traveling , and for buying inexpensive , poor quality clothing in order to fluff our wardrobe . When it comes to backpacking , at least , we should follow the European example . Buying a few , high quality garments will see you through many backpacking trips . Style does n't matter on the trail , comfort and quality do . Fortunately , there are many reputable manufacturers of backpacking clothing and you can purchase quality along with style . One good pair of Patagonia Stand Up shorts will last as long as , if not longer , than five cheap pairs of shorts . Layering Take the time to select your clothes carefully and think about layering . Buy an ensemble that can be adjusted to fit the circumstances . Consider your clothing options if you awake to a warm but rainy morning ? long johns or shorts , shirt , sweater or fleece jacket , rain gear . You may want to start out with the shorts , t-shirt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up despite the rain , you may drop the rain gear and opt for just getting wet . Come evening , you pull into camp and , no longer moving , you get a chill . Pull on your wool sweater and/ or your rain gear . On the other hand , if the morning had been rainy and cold , you could have layered your long johns under your shorts , rain gear and hat . Depending on the time of year , you may be comfortable in a pair of loose pants or tights instead of shorts . Layering allows you numerous options and the clothes involved in layering are lighter , more durable , and allow you greater physical flexibility . The layering system works better than other methods ( such as a separate outfit for each weather condition ) , especially when you get wet or sweat . It is important to layer with the right pieces ? long johns , pants 134 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s Polypropylene This petroleum-based synthetic is a lightweight fabric that keeps you warm when it 's wet . Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is non-absorbent . It will not retain moisture , wicking it away immediately . When used as your first layer of clothing , it keeps your skin dry by transferring moisture to your next layer . Polypropylene is primarily used in long johns and socks . One drawback to polypropylene is that it absorbs the scent of perspiration and must be washed in a special detergent to remove the odor . It is also renowned for its pilling , which can be annoying , especially to the fashion conscious . Polypropylene must be line-dried to prevent shrinkage . Thermax and Capilene Thermax is another synthetic used in garments designed to keep you warm . Like polypropylene , it draws moisture away from your body , and its hollow-core fibers trap air to provide insulation . Thermax can be machine-washed and tumbled dry , and it does not retain the odors of perspiration . Capilene is a polyester fiber and is similar to Thermax in its attributes ? it is odor resistant and can be machinewashed and dried . Both Capilene and Thermax are said to be softer than polypropylene and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because it 's one of the easiest synthetics to manufacture , you will find many nylons on the market . Nylon is inexpensive , durable , abrasion-resistant , strong , and drys quickly . There are hundreds of types of nylon , from the rough-textured Taslan and the super-tough Cordura to the supple , softer nylons such as Supplex , Taslan and ripstop . The best purchase we 've made is our nylon jogging shorts . Clothing ? 135 Not only do they have a built-in liner ( making underwear unnecessary ) , but they dry very quickly . The slick material also helps to keep our hip belts from rubbing us raw ? a very common backpacking problem . I traded my cotton blend , boxer-style shorts for the slippery nylon expressly to heal a hipbelt wound , which had begun to bleed . The new shorts cleared up the problem instantly . Polarplus , Polarlite , Patagonia Synchilla These bunting or pile materials are good insulators . Comfortable jackets and pants in Polarplus , a double-faced pile of fine-denier Dacron polyester ( denier is a unit of measure for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of Polarplus ; and Synchilla , Patagonia 's well-known , doublefaced synthetic pile , are bulky and heavy , but may be worth the extra bulk and weight on a cold night . For day hikes to higher altitudes , the insulation these materials provide offers good protection from wind and cold when taking a break . The materials are generally far too warm to actually hike in , but are said to be warmer per pound than wool and to dry more quickly than the natural fabric . Although Polarlite is supposed to be lighter than Polarplus and Synchilla , it appears to weigh approximately the same , if not more , when used to fabricate similar garments . As with food , you may want to inspect a little more closely anything termed " lite . " Others Lycra spandex is a very stretchy , strong synthetic used extensively in clothing ? from cuffs and waistbands on jackets to bras , socks , running tights and shorts . Tights made of a blend of polypropylene and lycra are especially popular because they keep you warm and conform to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 136 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s Fibers polymerized from acrylonitrile are called acrylics and are rarely used in their " pure " form in clothing except maybe in underwear . Acrylics such as Orlon are often found as a blend , especially in socks . Rain Gear " I used a rain jacket , rain pants , poncho , pack cover , and gaiters , and I still got soaked , " lamented hiker Peter Keenan . Sometimes you 're just going to get wet . It is easier to stay dry in the rain if you are standing still . Once you start hiking , you increase your chances of getting wet . In warm weather , hikers often refuse to fight the battle , opting to get wet by hiking in the rain in just shorts and tshirt . That 's all well and good when it 's steamy outside , but what about when its cold or even just a bit chilly ? Wet clothes can lower your body temperature to the danger point . Your greatest risk of hypothermia comes when you least expect it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Clothing ? 137 it for you to become hypothermic . Hikers die of hypothermia every year when they ignore their wet clothes on cool days . Rain gear is probably one of the most essential items on your clothing checklist . Ponchos The least effective of all rain gear options , most backpacking ponchos are designed to cover both you and your pack . Ponchos do shield you from a lot of the rain under ideal conditions , but in the wind they are practically useless . While a minority of hikers find ponchos meet their needs , most hikers who have tried ponchos dispose of them during their hike . Ponchos cost from $3 ( for a vinyl poncho ) to $30 ( for a coated nylon backpacker 's poncho ) . Rain Suits Rain suits ( a jacket and pants ) although usually designed in sets , can be purchased as separates . They afford the best protection against the cold and rain . In purchasing a rain suit , a major consideration is whether to get one in Gore-Tex or coated nylon . Gore-Tex : This fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of manufacturers of rainwear as well as many other clothing manufacturers . Gore-Tex is a hotly debated subject : hikers either swear by it or swear at it ; it is everything it claims to be or too expensive for the little it does . Clothing made with Gore-Tex promises to be both water repellant and breathable . The key to this is an extremely thin and very lightweight membrane patented by the W.L. Gore Company . Made up of two different substances , the Gore-Tex membrane keeps out the water while allowing moisture vapor to escape . The component that repels water is pure expanded polytetrafluoroethylene ( ePTFE ) , which is similar 138 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s to Teflon polymers and contains nine billion microscopic pores per square inch . Because the pores are smaller than a droplet of water but much larger than a molecule of water vapor , water ( in its liquid form ) can not penetrate the membrane . On the other hand , vapor released from your body can escape through the membrane to the outside . The second part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance that allows water vapor to pass through but keeps oil-based contaminants from penetrating the membrane . Oils , cosmetics , insect repellents and food substances would otherwise affect the breathability of the article of clothing . The oleophobic substance is also impenetrable to wind . This is said to make Gore-Tex both warm and water repellent , yet , according to the company , it keeps you comfortable by allowing water vapor to escape . The Gore-Tex membrane is found between the outer layer and inner lining of the garment . Depending on the piece of outerwear you purchase , the membrane will either be laminated or bonded to the outer fabric or hang freely between the two layers . The argument over whether or not Gore-Tex works centers around whether it is truly breathable and waterproof . Both Frank and I have hiked extensively in our Gore-Tex rain jackets . We have been cold and hot and dry and wet . Although the fabric seems to be sufficiently waterproof against light rain or brief showers , you still get wet in downpours and when backpacking all day in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket as it runs off your face and throat also cause the garment to get wet . The wetness caused by sweating should be eliminated by the fabric 's " breathability . " But in our experience , the fabric seems incapable of keeping up with the water vapor escaping the body while backpacking . Regardless , Gore-Tex is still the best fabric when it comes to rain gear ? it keeps you as dry as nylon and it affords some breathability . Clothing ? 139 Gore-Tex rain suits can be purchased from $200 to $500 price ; most cost approximately $300 . You can also purchase suits in a variety of weights ? some with extra rain protection , some with liners for added warmth . Among the designers of Gore-Tex rain wear are Columbia , L.L. Bean , Marmot , Montbell , Moonstone , Nike , The North Face , REI , Sierra Designs , Solstice and VauDe . Nylon : As with Gore-Tex , coated nylon rain suits can be found in a variety of styles . Because coated nylon makes no effort to be breathable , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also less expensive . Coated nylon rain suits must have the seams sealed to be effective . Seam sealer can be purchased through outfitters and mail order houses . Following the directions carefully and resealing the seams occasionally will ensure proper waterproofing . Nylon rain suits range from about $50 to $150 . Hats Hats are an indispensable part of your backpacking outfit . If your feet are cold , putting on a hat will warm them up because much of the body 's heat is lost through your head . Warming your head will do more toward warming your feet than adding an extra pair of socks . Another pair of socks might actually make your feet colder by making your boots too tight and constricting the circulation in your feet . A wool cap with a polypropylene liner will keep your head warm while wicking away perspiration . Thermax hats are also good for the same reason . If you will be doing a lot of cold weather backpacking , you may want to invest in a balaclava . This hat covers your head and neck and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extra shirt or sweater ! While not as warm , baseball-style caps are great for keeping the sun off your head and face . They are also great worn under your rain jacket hood to keep the hood from 140 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s dripping rain on your nose and to help the hood move with your head . All types of baseball caps are available , including those that offer a neck flap for extra protection against the sun . For those of you who go for the high ? tech products , Sequel offers the Desert Rhat Hat . An adjustable chin strap keeps the hat on your head even in high winds , a large bill with a black underbrim provides sun protection for your eyes and face , a breathable lining of Tex-O-Lite metallic film shields the top of your head from the sun 's intensity , a removable white cape reflects the sun , and a terrycloth headband absorbs the sweat ? all for under $30 . Socks There was a time when there was only one type of sock to wear with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now there are so many options , it 's hard to decide . While wool socks are still very present in the sock market , they are giving way to synthetic blends designed especially for backpacking . Wool , cotton/wool blends and cotton socks are not as good for backpacking compared to the wool/polypropylene or nylon blends and the Orlon acrylic/nylon blend of Thor-Lo socks . Wool socks retain foot odor while cotton socks do not retain their shape . The Thor-Los were designed specifically for sports and include designs for running , hiking , climbing and backpacking . The hiking socks average about $7 a pair . Gloves My hands get cold easily but I find that when hiking I rarely need gloves . Cold , wet days are the worst , especially once you make camp . I 've used glove liners without the gloves fairly successfully ? they are easier to manuever your fingers in because they do n't have the bulk of leather gloves . But for those days when sticking your hands in your pockets just Clothing ? 141 #@# #@# Hiking Tip ( ( ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hike by clipping them with alligator clips to the back of your pack . wo n't do ( what if you take a tumble with your hands in your pockets ? ) , there are a number of glove/mitten options available . From Gore-Tex shell and wool mittens to gloves of wool , wool-blends , Thinsulate , pile and other synthetics , you should be able to find a pair of hand warmers that fits your needs . Keep in mind that you can also purchase glove and mitten liners ( usually very lightweight and made of silk or synthetics used in the manufacture of thermal underwear ) for extra cold days . If you 're desperate , use plastic bags as vapor barrierstyle gloves . Bandanas In the backpacking world , you 're not a true hiker unless you have at least one bandana on your person . Bandanas are wonderfully versatile . I use them as headbands , hats and handkerchiefs . They can also be used to strain water before filtering and to cool hot necks ( dipping the bandana in water and loosely tying about your throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth for washing or as a towel for drying ( your body and your dishes ) . I always carry several with me when I am backpacking . Gaiters Hiking gaiters are made of water-resistant materials . They fasten below the knee and extend to cover the upper portion of your boots . Their purpose is to keep water and snow out of your boots so that they remain dry . Gaiters come in a variety of heights , from ankle-height to just below the knee . Some hikers wear the ankle gaiters to 142 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s keep dust and leaves from working their way into their boots . Gaiters are also useful when hiking through wet brush , grass , and leaves and poison ivy . Unlike pack covers and rain suits , gaiters are not essential rainwear for any hike . However , they may make your hikes more comfortable and are worth looking into , particularly for hikes in the snow . Town Clothes If you intend to spend more than a week on the trail , and especially if you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along " town clothes . " All this means is that you stash away one t-shirt that you will wear only when hitching or hiking into a town . Your appearance and your attitude will determine how you are treated when you go to town . Some female hikers carry " scrunchable " gauze skirts . They can pack down small , they 're light , and they 're supposed to look wrinkled anyway . Taking Care of Clothing While backpacking , care of your clothing will be limited to a bit of rinsing here and there . On short trips ( unless your clothes get really awful ) , you can wait until you get home to clean your clothing according to the tags ' instructions . While hiking , I rinse out my nylon shorts every other day ( or every day , if I have really sweated ) . I simply rinse them in a cookpot and hang them to dry on a branch or rock if it 's a dry night . If it 's wet outside , I take them to bed with me , stuffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not dry by morning , I just wait for body heat to dry them out while I hike ( or wet them down again with my sweat ) . T-shirts and socks can be rinsed in the same manner and cleaned once a week using a biodegradable soap . Some synthetics require a special detergent to rid them of their Clothing ? 143 perspiration odors . Read labels and know before you go . Never , never wash your clothes in a water source ? even biodegradable soaps leave suds and a bad taste . Always dump dirty wash water far from any water source . If you are on a long-distance hike , you will hit an occasional town where you can wash your clothes in a laundromat . Another method for drying clothes ? other than hanging them on a branch or rock ? is by using your rope to form a clothesline . Light-weight clothes pins are available at outdoors stores or you can center your rope around a tree , twist it tightly , tie it to another tree , and then pull apart a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry a thin , light-weight line just for this purpose . Vapor Barrier System The vapor barrier system is a way to get warm the quickest way possible when you 're really cold . It involves using an impermeable barrier such as a plastic bag to retain both your body 's heat and moisture . Although not exactly comfortable because you stay wet , it is extremely effective . Vapor barriers can be used in sleeping bag liners and in clothes such as pants , shirts , socks and gloves . I am from the school that believes vapor barriers are just fine when it 's freezing cold outside and there is no other way to get warm . I have used plastic bags a number of times to warm up my feet , especially when my boots have failed to dry from the previous days of rain and it is raining again . Some people believe in using vapor barriers in all coldweather situations while others would rather die then submit themselves to the agony of the vapor barrier . Try it before you decide . You may like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specially-made garments and that you would rather rely on your Ziploc bags . 144 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s Heat Loss When backpacking , your body is subjected to four kinds of heat loss . Keep these in mind when purchasing backpacking clothes . Do the clothes effectively prevent or produce this heat loss ? Convective Heat Loss : This most common form of heat loss occurs when air and water come into contact , or near-contact , with your body and carry heat away with them . Materials such as pile , down , wool , PolarGuard and Hollofil , and Thinsulate work as a barrier against convective loss ? retaining most of your body 's heat . Evaporative Heat Loss : When you sweat , you lose heat through the evaporation of the liquid . This is great in warm weather because it cools the body ; but when it 's cold and once you stop moving , your clothes remain wet and so do you . This can lead to hypothermia . Fortunately for backpackers , materials such as polypropylene have been designed to wick away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisture from the skin before it evaporates . Conductive Heat Loss : Although this is usually a relatively minor way to lose heat , it can be dangerous in certain Clothing ? 145 circumstances . Conductive heat loss occurs when the body loses heat to the air , water or fabric that is in contact with the body at a lower temperature . Falling into cold water , for example , you lose all your body heat to the water , a potentially fatal situation . Radiant Heat Loss : Another minor method of heat loss is when heat radiates out from your body into your clothes . Unless the fabric you are wearing reflects the heat back to you , the heat is lost to the air . Vapor barriers reflect the heat back to your body . .9 .

This experience would have been impossible without our backpacks . Carrying everything you need on your back opens the door to experiences otherwise impossible ? from a shared sunrise with a deer atop a Tennessee bald to a bath in the icy water of a stream meandering through a remote Sierra meadow . The all-important backpack is the " eponym " of the experience just described . Gone are the days of blanket rolls and heavy , shapeless canvas bags . Today , selecting a pack is almost as tough as finding a pair of boots . Dozens of manufacturers offer hundreds of options . 148 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s The type of pack you choose is important , whether you 're out for a day or for an extended trip . Although the hike is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live with it every moment that it 's on your back . Advances in technology have made backpacking easier on hikers but as with other types of equipment , you first must choose what type of packing you 'll be doing and on what terrain . Fortunately , your choices are limited to internal or external frames ? the internal designed for rugged , mountain backpacking ; the external for gentle to moderate terrain . ( The frameless rucksack is experiencing a comeback as well , and a number of manufacturers offer these packs for hikers who like to travel light . ) External versus Internal Frame Both frame designs have their pros and cons . The basic differences are : the external frame is designed to distribute weight equally and has a high center of gravity , ( perfect for established trails ) ; the internal frame pack is designed to custom-fit each wearer and has a low center of gravity , ( popular for off-trail hiking and mountaineering ) . Also , the external frame is said to be cooler than the internal frame because it is designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the internal frame . The external frame is better built to carry heavier loads ( more than 50 pounds ) . External Frame External frame packs are designed to carry big loads ( 25 pounds or more ) . Because you will probably carry about as much for a weekend trip as you would for a longer trip , an external frame needs to have approximately 3,000 cubic inches carrying capacity . External frame packs come in top-loading , front-loading , and combination models . A top-loading pack works like a duffle bag attached to a frame , whereas , front-loading packs give you easy access to your gear . But most manufacturers design their external packs with both a top-loaded and frontloaded section as well as front and side pockets . The most important feature is the pack 's hip belt . The hip belt carries the bulk of the weight , so that a properly fitted pack allows you to drop one shoulder out of its strap without 152 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s to your body , it is often not as comfortable as a load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack will need a minimum volume of 4,000 cubic inches to be comparable to an external frame pack with a 3,000-cubic-inch capacity . This is because sleeping gear is attached to the frame of an external pack but is carried in a special compartment inside the internal frame pack . Most internal frame packs are top-loading and they do not come with external pockets , another drawback . Internals are the most expensive of all packs . Internal frame packs are equipped with harnesses , straps , and other adjustments so that the pack may be form-fitted to each wearer . The hip belt on the internal frame pack is form-fitted and is part of the pack . Although it is adjustable and is offered in several sizes within the pack style itself , it is not optional or easily replaceable . Some pack manufacturers are beginning to make interchangeable parts for internal frame packs . Things to look for in an internal frame include : Contoured aluminum stays to help distribute weight to your hips . Thick , padded shoulder straps and hip belt . A lumbar pad that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straps to keep smaller loads from shifting . A reinforced bottom to resist abrasion . A lot of lash points and loops to carry gear outside the pack . A slim profile with either outside or add-on pockets . Cinch straps at the shoulder and waist to keep the load close to your back . Internal frames can rarely be found for less than $100 and can cost as much as $500 . Camp Trails , Dana Designs , Backpacks ? 153 Gregory , Kelty , Lowe , Mountainsmith , The North Face and REI are popular internal frame manufacturers . The chart on the following page is merely a representative selection of some of the many packs available to backpackers . We neither endorse nor condemn any of these packs . Frameless Rucksacks These approximately 2,500-cubic-inch packs are regaining their popularity . For those backpackers who can travel with the bare minimum and do n't need the support and suspension of a framed pack , the rucksack is an option . Most manufacturers carry frameless packs ranging in price from less than $100 to $200 . The Overnight or Two-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips with the overnight or two-day type pack . The advantages of the two-day pack are obvious ? not only do you carry less weight , but stress to your body is lessened . The approximately 2,000-cubic-inch internal frame packs are definitely not for everyone . Alan Adams regularly hikes with a two-day pack , in which he carries about twenty pounds for each five-day trip . Adams said that by not carrying more than five percent of his body weight , he remains comfortable while hiking . " Any more than that is work , " he commented . Adams keeps his pack weight down by using a two-pound sleeping bag and sleeping under a fly rather than in a tent . Once again , decide how much you can do without and still enjoy your hike before purchasing a smaller-than-average pack . Two-day/overnight packs range from under $25 to $200 . Gregory 's " The Two Day " is especially popular . Backpacks ? 155 Daypacks Most daypacks are made in the same teardrop style , so the important thing to look at is how well the pack is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , but if they are poorly padded and have little support , you wo n't have hiked a mile before you regret the purchase . Leather-bottomed packs are the most durable and carry the load better by supporting the weight rather than collapsing beneath it . Make sure the shoulder straps on your day pack are very secure because this is the first place that such packs fall apart . This occurs because you are carrying the weight on your shoulders as opposed to your hips . To prevent ripping , a number of day packs have extra reinforcement where the shoulder straps connect to the sack . Another feature to look for is padding at the back of the pack . The more reinforced this section , the less likely you 'll be poked and prodded by the objects inside the pack . Features to look for in daypacks include : Convenient loading through top or front panel . Pockets for smaller items ( some daypacks feature a special loop to hold keys ) . A waist strap to keep the back from bouncing against your back . Padded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually less than $100 and most manufacturers feature a variety to choose from . Fanny Packs Another way of keeping things handy is using a fanny pack in conjunction with your backpack . Many hikers use these miniature packs in reverse , snug across their bellies with the strap fastened in the small of the back . Cameras , water , 156 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s Hiking Secret A daypack can do double duty as a stuff sack for your sleeping bag . The daypack will then be handy for sidetrips or for slack-packing on long-distance hikes . Slack-packing is accomplished by finding someone to meet you at the next trail head with your pack so that you can cover a distance quickly without the burden of your pack . snacks , data books , maps , guides , or whatever you need quick access to can be carried by this method . Fanny packs are useful on day hikes for the same reasons , but they are not as comfortable as daypacks because they do not distribute the weight as well , and often can not carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be used along with a day pack or alone ( if you have a partner carrying a daypack ) . When purchasing a fanny pack , make sure the belt is well padded for comfort and the sack is sturdy enough to carry the load you intend for it . Some fanny packs are designed to carry only very light loads and will sag if heavy objects are placed in them . Also , if the fabric is thin , you may get poked and prodded by the objects inside .

Pack Construction Put some mileage on your pack and soon it will begin wearing out . The frame , seams and zippers are especially subject to wear . Frank had a pack whose frame literally exploded off his back when it finally died . I lost an adjustment strap on my hipbelt , a relatively minor inconvenience compared to the number of miles I 've put on that pack . When purchasing a pack , check your pack frame ( if you buy an external ) for sturdiness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforcements , especially at the stress points . Make sure that there is sufficient room between the stitching and the edge of the seam and fabric because this is a likely place for it to separate . Feel free to tug and pull on the pack as much as you like  --  better to have it fall apart in the store than on your first trip out hiking . Buy a pack with heavy zippers . They are more durable . Also , if it is a front-loading pack , make sure there are compression straps to take the pressure off the zippers once loaded . Fit Before buying any pack , you should test it first . The best method is to rent a pack and try it out on a weekend hike . Some stores even offer rent-to-buy programs . If you ca n't do that , see if you ca n't load up the pack you 're interested in and try it out in the store . Many stores have sand bags on hand for this purpose . Also , keep in mind that torso length is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height . For example , if a pack is suggested for someone six feet tall , it may also be appropriate for a shorter person with a longer torso  --  another reason to try on a pack before you buy it . The hip belt should fit snugly around the top part of your hips and not catch your legs when you 're hiking up hill . The belt should be heavily padded for comfort , durability and stability . Most importantly , make sure the hipbelt has a durable , easy-release buckle . There are times when you may have to get out of your pack quickly . Tips for Fitting an External Frame : When fitting your pack make sure that the shoulder straps are level with or an inch or two above the shoulder . The mesh back band should fit snugly , but comfortably , against your back and the hip belt should ride on your pelvis . Move the hip belt up and down the frame to prevent the lower end of the frame from making contact with your lower back . Shoulder straps should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mounted too high they put too much of the wait on your shoulders ; too low , on your hips . If the pack comes with load-lifters , they should join the frame at ear level and attach to the shoulder straps over your collarbone . Weight can be distributed from shoulders to hips with these straps . A sternum strap will help hold the pack more closely to your back . Accessory features in packs include ice axe loops , crampon patches , ski holders , accessory pockets and camera rings . On some packs you will find that these features are standard rather than optional . Backpacks ? 159 Tips for Fitting an Internal Frame : Once the hip belt is fastened , make sure that the pack 's stays protrude two to four inches above your shoulders . If the stays are less than two inches above your shoulders , look for a larger pack . If they are more than four inches , look for a smaller pack . If the padded ends of the hip belt overlap in front , the belt is too big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger belt . The pack fits you in the shoulders if the shoulder straps join the pack about two inches below the tops of your shoulders . The lower ends of the straps should be a hand 's width below your armpits . Load-lifter straps should join your frame at ear level to comfortably divert pressure to the front of your shoulders . The buckles for these straps should be positioned over your collarbone . Weight can be distributed from waist to shoulders with these straps , and you should vary the position as you hike for the most comfort . If the pack hugs your back like a child holding on for a piggyback ride , you have a proper fit . If the waist belt is distorted by the way you cinched your stabilizing belts , the pack needs readjustment . Always make sure the pack is cinched tightly . How Much to Carry in Your Pack An easy-to-use rule of thumb is to never carry more than onethird of your body weight . On shorter trips , it is wiser to carry even less ? one-quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you should carry only one-fifth of your body weight , but that can be difficult to do , especially if you are winter hiking or carrying a week 's worth of food . What if you pack your pack and it weighs 60 pounds and you weigh only 120 ? Unpack and look at everything very carefully . Items like your stove , tent , and sleeping bag are 160 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s absolutely essential . But what about your clothes ? You do n't have to wear something different every day . Another area people overpack in is toiletries . If you must shave , deodorize , shampoo , etc. , try to find sample size containers . Do n't bring a radio unless it 's the compact " Walkman " type . Flashlights that are " hiker-friendly " can be purchased readily these days . A small flashlight that uses AA batteries will serve you just as well as one that uses C or D batteries . Those are just a few examples . Chapters 8 and 10 also provide suggestions on what to pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sure you ca n't live without it ? Packing Your Pack Once you 've bought a pack , where do you put what ? You 're going to want certain items to be handy . Any system that you come up with will work as long as you know how to get at those necessary items quickly . Rain gear , for example , will be something that you 'll want to be able to lay your hands on immediately . It is not unusual to be caught in a sudden downpour , and if you have to drop your pack and dig through it to get at your raingear , you and all your gear may be soaked by the time you find it . You will also need a means to carry water so that you can get at it without taking off your pack . Some hikers use holsters for their water bottles while others keep their canteens within easy reach in a side pocket on their packs . It also is important to distribute the weight as equally as possible . For example , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes on the other . Believe it or not , food will be a good third of the weight you are carrying . Packing the heavier stuff toward the top of your pack will keep the load centered over your hips , particularly in an external frame pack . On the other hand , do n't follow this rule Backpacks ? 161 to its furthest possible conclusion because an overly topheavy pack is also unwieldy . Sleeping bags are usually secured at the bottom of an external frame pack , strapped to the frame just below the pack sack . In the internal frame packs , the sleeping bag compartment is usually the bottom third of the pack . Another suggestion : you will probably want your food more readily available than your clothes and cooking gear , particularly at lunch time . Nothing is more aggravating than to have to dig through your clothes just so you can satisfy your craving for Gorp . Loading Tips : ? On gentle terrain , pack the heaviest items high and close to the back . Because the pack 's center of gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight bend at the waist while hiking to align the weight over your hips . ? If balance is crucial ( climbing , off-trail travel , rough terrain ) , pack heavy items in the center , close to your back . You may have to lean over more to offset the pack 's weight , but balance is better because the pack 's topheaviness is reduced . ? If you are carrying anything sharp in your pack , pad it well . The last thing you want is to be stabbed in the back . ? Women have a lower center of gravity and do well to pack dense items lower and closer to the back . #@# #@# Hiking Tip ( ( ( ( If you are going to take your backpack on an airplane remember that the straps and/or frame will make the pack difficult for airlines to handle . To prevent damage in transit , pack your backpack into a large duffel bag before you check it as luggage . 4 162 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s ? Color-coded stuff sacks are a great backpacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly adjusted to your torso . ? Long items should be lashed to the pack frame . Pack Covers Although all backpacks are made of water resistant material , moisture will seep through seams and zippers and saturate your gear if your pack is left unprotected . A pack cover can be anything from a heavy duty garbage bag , which will keep your pack dry when camping ( and protect it from the dew at night ) , to a specially designed cover made for the purpose . These coated nylon or Gore-tex covers , when their own seams are properly sealed , fit over your pack but still allow you to hike . They are usually fitted to your pack by elastic or a drawstring . No matter what kind of pack cover you purchase ( and you do need to buy one ) , you will still want to carry a heavy duty ( BIG ) garbage bag to keep your pack covered at night because pack covers are not designed to protect the straps and back of your pack . A plastic garbage bag is indispensable when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have room for your pack in the tent . Backpacks ? 163 The poncho-style pack covers work under ideal conditions only . The poncho is designed to be a one-piece rain gear , covering both you and your pack at the same time . Not only do ponchos tend to tear easily , but they work only when the wind is not blowing hard . If the wind whips up , so will your poncho ; and both you and your pack will soon be soaked . For added insurance , anything you do n't want to get wet can be slipped into a plastic bag before being stored in your pack . ? 10 ? Other Equipment WHILE BEING INTERVIEWED on CNN about hiking vac , tions , Frank and I were asked by a caller what we left at home in order to keep our packs light . The kitchen sink , I thought at the time . But upon later reflection I realized it was n't such a silly question after all . What we leave behind to keep of packs light is different than what others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am on a backpacking trip so it 's easy for me to leave mine behind . But there are those who ca n't live without it and there are now televisions sms enough to fit in a pack or even on your wrist . Some peop carry guitars while others ca n't live with out their tapes ar portable tape player . I usually carry a book or two and journal ; Frank carries camera equipment . Another of of concessions to luxury is spices . ( Trail meals are unappetizing enough without the garlic , pepper and Tabasco . ) While most of us agonize over what to take and what leave behind , some people go to extremes to cut down ( everything in order to reduce the weight they are carryin They even go so far as to cut the handles off their toothbrush and the corners off their maps . In addition to the basics ? tent , pack , boots , sleeping ba 166 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s etc. ? there are some other articles you will probably want to consider taking along on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night or more . Carefully select the equipment you really need and leave at home things that are extra , or even ridiculous . You will be much more comfortable without the added weight . Toiletries Depending on the length of your hiking trip , you may want to consider bringing along items such as towel , shampoo/soap , deodorant , razors/shaving cream , toothbrush/toothpaste , eyecare items and toilet paper . Towel Most hikers do not carry a towel , per se . We usually carry bandanas and one handcloth for the purpose of washing and/ or drying . In warm weather , we let the sun do the job of drying our skin . In cold weather , we use the cloth to hand bathe ourselves with heated water and then dry with a bandana . For those who need a towel , the super absorbent " Pack Tow . " costs about $5 and the manufacturers boast that the towel absorbs up to ten times its weight , as well as dries quickly ( which is important because who wants to carry around a soggy , one-pound towel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variations on the " Pack Towl . " Shampoo/soap Never , ever , wash yourself or your hair in a stream , pond , or other body of water . And never use anything but biodegradable soap . Would you want to drink water that someone had rinsed soap off into ? A lot of the water sources along trails provide drinking water for hikers as well as for animals . Biodegradable soap ( at least the widely available Dr. Bronner 's ) does not work as a shampoo . While you ca n't beat Other Equipment ? 167 it for washing your body , it leaves your hair lank and greasy . Before depending on a biodegradable soap as an all-round cleaner , I would suggest testing it on the various things you plan to use it for ( ie. hair , body , clothes , pots and pans ) . There are a number of biodegradable soaps available from outdoors stores , including Mountain Suds , Bio-suds and Sunshower Soap . Soaps average around $3 for a four-ounce bottle . There is a soap product on the market called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one quart of water to bathe . N/R , Laboratories claims that you simply massage NO-Rinse in and towel dry it out . NO-Rinse Body Bath and NO-Rinse Shampoo are available from Goodman Marketing ( P.O. Box 5459 , Dept . S , Fresno , CA 93755-5459 ) . The cost is $14.95 plus $4 shipping and handling for one 8-ounce bottle of each . If your soap does n't work as a shampoo , most discount department stores ( such as Wal-Mart and K-Mart ) and drug stores offer trial or sample size products that are great for backpacking . Shampoos are commonly available in sample sizes as are toothpastes and lotions . I 've used a variety of shampoos while backpacking but if you can find a biodegradable shampoo you 'll lessen your detrimental effect on the environment . As with soaps , though , never wash your hair with shampoo in or near a water source . By the way , even the most hard-core hikers bathe occasionally . Deodorant While soap is a necessity , deodorant is considered optional . We use it only on visits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell you but yourself ( and other smelly hikers ) ! You may also want to consider that the less smelly you are , in terms of artificial odors such as perfumed deodorants , the less likely you 'll be to scare wildlife away or to attract unwanted insects . 168 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s The most natural way to deodorize yourself is by using what is known as a deodorant rock . Composed of natural mineral salts , this crystal-like deodorant supposedly lasts a full year with normal use . My husband and I tried one at home and found that unless you thoroughly cleanse your underarms before each application , your underarm odor builds up very quickly . On the otherhand , this makes it an ideal deodorant for backpacking because you would only use it occasionally , anyway . Deodorant rocks are available at health food stores and through some catalogs . Two of the more popular brands are NATURE 'S Pure Crystal Deodorant and Le Crystal Naturel . Deodorant rocks cost approximately $16 . Another relatively natural way to deodorize yourself is to use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father has used it successfully for years . If you 're not interested in these natural methods of stopping perspiration odor , you can always carry your favorite deodorant in its sample or regular size . Do keep in mind , especially during the hot and humid days of summer , that you probably reek . The longer you 're out on the trail , deodorantless , the more you become accustomed to your body 's odor . Which , believe it or not , is n't half as bad as the odor perspiration leaves in your clothes . The clothes you hike in ought to be washed every so often , as well . People will be more willing to give needy hikers a hitch if they look presentable and smell as inoffensive as possible after spending days or weeks in the woods . While staying with some friends during one backpacking trip we left a lasting impression on our hostess 's olfactory nerves . She later told us that on our first night there she had prowled about the house , sniffing , unable to sleep or to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the entranceway and found the odoriferous source of her nocturnal wanderings ? our boots . She quickly banished them Other Equipment ? 169 outdoors . Embarrassing ? You betchum Red Rider . When someone offers you hospitality while backpacking , the last thing you want to do is offend them . If someone invites you to stay , kindly leave your boots outside . Remember , you 're used to their smell , but others will find it overwhelming . Most people will be too polite to mention it , so it 's up to you to keep your odor under control , at least when you 're off the trail . Razors/Shaving cream Most men opt to grow a beard when hiking , although some do take the trouble to shave every day or now and then . The same goes for women ? many prefer to let the hair under their arms and on their legs grow out while hiking . It 's all a matter of preference . I shave at least once a week , using biodegradable soap and a disposable razor , when long-distance hiking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric razor is another option . Toothbrush/toothpaste Do n't brush your teeth near a water source . Dig a small hole to spit into and then cover your spit . As for toothcare products , there are a variety of options on the market , but a child 's toothbrush works great because it is small and lightweight ! Toothpaste can easily be purchased in sample sizes or you might want to try using baking soda that you can transfer to a small bottle for convenience . Eyecare I am continually amazed at the number of hikers who elect to wear contact lenses during their long-distance hikes . But as risky as it seems , I also wear contacts ; although I carry a pair of glasses just in case . The new , daily and extended wear lenses are easy to care for and the cleaning fluid does not add much weight to my pack . Personally , unless I am sitting still , 170 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s my body heat raised by the exertion of hiking , fogs my glasses up so badly , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slide off my nose . I remember one night counting three out of six of us wearing contact lenses . Two wore glasses and only Frank had 20/20 vision . Improvements for hikers extend beyond backpacking equipment ! Toilet Paper Of course you know you need to bring toilet paper . Even day hikers need it occasionally . A good way to pack it is to scrunch it flat and stick it in a resealable plastic bag . By removing the cardboard tube in the center and unraveling the paper from the inside , you will find that your toilet paper crushes down flatter in its plastic bag . Scot toilet tissue seems to have the most paper for the money . And , while we 're on the subject ... one of the worst sights we saw while hiking through the Great Smoky Mountains were the wads of toilet paper scattered through the woods near shelters . Please take the time to dig a cat hole for your toilet paper and for your feces . A backpacker 's trowel weighs a mere two ounces and costs less than $2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you consider how much it will lessen your environmental impact . Never relieve yourself near a water source . Always find a site at least fifty yards downhill or to the side of a water source . This is for the protection of wildlife as well as other hikers . According to the Centers for Disease Control , beavers living downstream from national parks and forests contract giardiasis ( caused by humans ) more often than humans pick up the infamous stomach ailment . A note to women : Urination for male backpackers is as easy , if not easier because there is no seat to lift , as it is in the " real " world . And although some trails offer the occasional Other Equipment ? 171 outhouse , the chances of your stumbling upon one at the appropriate moment are about nil . Even then , you 're likely to find a note requesting you to relieve yourself in the woods because some outhouses are reserved for defecation only . If you 're strong enough and have a good aim , it is possible to pee with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your knees , bend your knees a bit , lean forward with your hands on your knees for support , relax and go . Another option is take off your pack and find what Kathleen Meyer , author of How to Shit in the Woods , calls the perfect pose . Find two rocks , a rock and a log , two logs , or if necessary , a steep slope and a log or rock . Sitting on one , you balance your feet on the other and avoid the splashed boots that are so common when women try to pee outdoors . A third option is a funnel , but make sure you purchase one with a long hose . The funnels are designed to slip easily into your pants and transport your urine outside . I never even got up the nerve to try mine , feeling certain that no matter what I did I 'd end up with soggy britches . Menstruation is another problem women face in the wilderness . On most trips , it 's going to be " pack it in , pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough resealable bags to hold your used tampons or napkins . Burning is another option , but the fire must be very hot to completely burn a tampon or napkin . Never burn plastic applicators because they release poisons into the air . Your best choice is going to be an applicatorless tampon such as OBs . They are compact and produce the least amount of waste all the way around . Once used , wrap them in a bit of toilet paper and seal in a plastic bag until you reach a suitable dumping station . Never drop your tampons or napkins into a latrine nor should you bury them because it will take them years to disintegrate , if animals do n't dig them up first . 172 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s First-aid Kit Keeping in mind the fact that it is next to impossible to create a perfect first-aid kit , the following is a list of what makes up a close-to-perfect kit : A Ziploc or other brand zipper-lock plastic bag to hold the items in your first aid kit . Approximately six , one-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover most scratches , cuts and scrapes . Two , four-inch by four-inch , sterile gauze pads that can be cut down or doubled up depending on the size of the wound . A roll of athletic tape ? one inch by ten yards ? has a variety of uses from holding on the sterile gauze to wrapping ankles . Tincture ofbenzoin . Not only does this liquid toughen feet but it helps tape stick better when rubbed on the skin . A couple of butterfly band-aids for closing small , gaping wounds . An individually wrapped sanitary napkin is great for staunching heavily bleeding wounds . Povidone-iodine ointment has a number of uses ? disinfects wounds ( straight from the tube ) ; dissolves in water for a wash for larger scrapes ; and can even be used as a lubricant or to treat water in an emergency . Moleskin to treat hot spots and blisters . Your favorite painkiller for aches , pains , fever , etc . A six-inch-wide elastic wrap ( such as made by Ace ) . These can be used to wrap strains and sprains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake bites , compress heavy bleeding or splint a broken bone . A few safety pins always come in handy . They can be used to hold the Ace bandage , drain blisters , repair clothing , etc . A few antihistamine tablets such as Benadryl to combat insect bites and poison ivy . Other Equipment ? 173 ? Pepto-Bismol or some similar tablets for upset stomachs . ? Scissors and tweezers . ( You may be able to find a pocket knife with these items . My tiny Victorinox has both and they have come in handy many times . ) Other items to consider , depending on the time of year and the location of your hike , are meat tenderizer or Sting-eze for insect bites , sunscreen , alcohol to help remove ticks ( and toughen feet ) , lip balm , lotion , prescription drugs if you need them , a bee sting kit if you are allergic to insect stings , and DEET repellent for mosquitos and other insects ( see Chapter 12 ) . Remember that a first aid kit is a very personal thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , by all means carry a laxative while hiking . I use lip balm ( Chap Stick works best for me ) constantly both at home and while hiking . I ca n't abide the feeling of chapped lips and always carry several tubes of Chap Stick with me where ever I go . Other good lip balms are Blistex , Carmex and Labiosin . You can find many options both at drug stores and outdoors stores . Some people have problems with hemorrhoids while hiking and always include Preparation H or Tucks Pads in their kits . Some women may find it necessary to carry birth control pills . Hiking in the summer , desert or snow might make it necessary for you to carry a sunscreen with a sun protection factor ( SPF ) in line with your skin 's sensitivity to the sun . The higher the SPF number , the less likely you are to be burned . As with lip balms , you can find a wide range of sunscreens to choose from at your local drug , discount and outdoors stores . Lotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kit if you intend to be hiking in hot , dry weather . Some sunscreens combine lotion with the screen or you may wish to carry a sample size of your favorite brand . Remember , though , 174 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s that baby oil acts as a sun tan lotion as well as a skin softener and could be potentially dangerous if you intend to use it as a lotion . If you will be doing some desert hiking you may want to carry along a lotion with aloe vera that will help soothe any sunburn you might get . If your skin is very sensitive to the sun , a sunburn therapy such as Solarcaine or Ahhh might be worth the extra weight in your first aid kit . But , unless you have a special need or problem , do not carry too many specific items in your first aid kit . The kit and its contents should be as versatile as possible . It wo n't matter that you have to cover a two-inch wide wound with a four-inch wide bandage , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasonally or yearly . Medicines expire and may need to be replaced so always check the expiration dates before heading out on any trip . And there is no use carrying insect repellent on a winter trip when there are no bugs around . Your first-aid kit should reflect your personal needs as well as the season and geographic area through which you 're hiking . Most importantly , do not carry anything in your kit that you do not know how to use . For example , a suture kit will be useless to you unless you have been trained in suturing wounds . Do n't carry prescription medicines unless you are fully aware of their side-effects and how to use them . Depending on how safety-conscious you are , there are all sorts of items available to ease your mind while hiking . Everything from dental emergency kits to accident report forms can be purchased for your first aid kit . Although I 've never known any one to use one , some people feel safer if they carry along a snake-bite kit . There are several kits on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kit contains two big suction cups plus a smaller suction cup for bites on small surfaces such as fingers . The kit also includes a lymph constrictor , scalpel , antiseptic vial and Other Equipment ? 175 instructions . The $10 Extractor is a double-chamber vacuum pump with four cup sizes , antiseptic , band-aids , a safety razor , instructions and a carrying case . The Extractor is the only recommended first aid for snake bites these days and it is said that even it does little to help . Outdoors stores offer a variety of first aid kits ranging in price from $8 to $80 . Outdoor Research , Adventure Medical Kits and REI are some of the major manufacturers of first aid kits . Items for Emergencies When it comes to emergencies , some people like to carry along a mirror , flares and a whistle . I carry a mirror , anyway , because I need it to insert my contact lenses , but you may want to consider carrying a mirror should you need it to signal someone below or above you . If your watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it instead . Some compasses have sighting mirrors that can be used for signaling or you can use foil , your stove 's windscreen ( if it reflects ) or even your sunglasses . Signal mirrors , on the other hand , are usually too heavy to be carried by a backpacker . I 've never carried one , but some backpackers feel safer if they carry along a flare or smoke bomb for emergencies . The bombs emit clouds of orange or red smoke that can be seen from both the ground and the air . Flares can be shot up into the air and usually burn for an average of seven seconds . I have seen both smoke bombs and flares available through catalogs ? $8 for the bomb , $16 for three flares ? and most outdoors stores keep them in stock as well . For use in both an emergency and as a warning to bears , you can also carry a whistle in your " emergency kit . " Just make sure you use the whistle only in emergency situations because in addition to crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people out there who are seeking peace and quiet . 176 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s If you purchase a whistle , make sure the balls inside are made of metal or plastic . Cork , if it gets wet , will ruin your whistle . Survival whistles can be purchased for under $3 . There is a gadget on the market called the Survivo II that includes an accurate compass , water proof match case , whistle , striking flint and signal mirror . It is packed in a 4.5-inch by 1.25-inch case , weighs a mere ounce , and costs only $4 . Sunglasses There are so many options when it comes to sunglasses that I can not begin to recommend any one particular brand . If you do carry sunglasses , and I recommend that you do , make sure that the lenses are designed to filter out the sun 's harmful rays ? both ultraviolet and infrared . Sunglasses are especially essential for desert and snow hiking where the sun reflects off the ground and into your eyes . Sunglasses can be purchased from $5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck ? Chums , Croakies and others ? are worth the extra $5 because they keep you from losing your sunglasses . This is especially beneficial if you just paid $40 for your shades . There are also a number of other " gadgets " that can be purchased for sunglasses ( and glasses , if you wear them ) including defoggers and lens cleaners , cases , windguards and clip-on sun shades for eyeglass wearers . Sunglasses are now manufactured for children , including glasses that filter out ultraviolet and infrared rays . Sunscreen Walking in shorts and a t-shirt leaves a hiker exposed to the suns rays for several hours a day . To prevent burning , wear a sunscreen or sunblock . If you have fair or sensitive skin , you will need a sunscreen with a sun protection factor ( SPF ) of at least 15 . Other Equipment ? 177 Binoculars Carrying binoculars is a matter of preference but modern technology has made them both lightweight and tough so the heavy , bulky binoculars of yore are no longer an excuse not to bother . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind besides weight and durability . First of all , binoculars are identified by two numbers : the magnification and the lens size ( for example , 10 X 25 ) . It will be these two numbers that determine the quality of your binoculars . Magnification ? the larger the number , the greater the magnifying power . Numbers greater than 10 , though , mean you will have a hard time keeping your hand steady enough to focus on whatever object you 've sighted . Lens size ? the second number identifies the diameter , in millimeters , of the objective lens . The objective lens is the lens farthest away from your eye . The larger the objective lens , the more light that reaches your eye and the brighter the image you see . Obviously , the higher the magnification number and the larger the objective lens , the more expensive your binoculars will be . There are a number of binocular manufacturers including Brunton , Leica , Nikon , Minolta , Swarovski , Pentax , Steiner and Bushnell . Lighting Very simply put , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for evenings at camp and on the trail . From time to time , it will be a relief to have a light to help find things in a dark tent or shelter . Lanterns The big , heavy , white gas lanterns have a place in camping but not in backpacking . They are bright and efficient but are far too heavy and bulky to carry along on a backpacking trip . 178 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s There are also heavy battery-powered lanterns that weigh even more and are made for family camping . We started out on our first backpacking trip with a candle lantern , and have continued to use ours , although we have also purchased a flashlight . Candle lanterns ( some of which can be equipped to use gas ) are your best bet if you want to carry a lantern . They weigh as little as six ounces ( sold by Limelight Productions , REI and Early Winters and at some outdoors stores under the generic ? Candle Lantern ) . One candle will give you as much as eight hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very bright , but it works better than a flashlight for cooking , cleaning , reading and writing when you make camp at dark . The candle lantern is better than a candle alone because it is safer . It is housed in metal and glass , so you are less likely to start an unwanted fire if it tips over . It is also more economical because it is protected from the wind and , thus , does not burn up as quickly as a candle . You can purchase a candle lantern for $10 to $20 and refills for about 50 cents a piece . Small oil and gas lanterns burn for up to twenty hours per fill-up and cost about $20 to $25 . They weigh the same as candle lanterns , and some can take different grades of lamp oil , including citronella ( the insect repellent ) . All lanterns are equipped with a hanger and can often be rigged to hang from the apex of your tent by an attached nylon cord . Many tents have loops in the apex that will allow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a loop at its apex , it may be possible to add a loop of velcro or sew on a loop , yourself . Some tents have loops in the corners designed to hold gear lofts from which you can rig a line to hold a candle lantern . Remember to keep the lantern a safe distance from the material of the tent so you wo n't burn holes in the tent or set it afire . Other Equipment ? 179 Hiking Secret Your flashlight can do occasional double duty as a lantern . Place a Nalgene brand or other translucent bottle over the end of the flashight to disperse light . Stand the bottle up on the open end and you have a serviceable lantern . Flashlights On our first backpacking trip , we did n't think we 'd need a flashlight because we had a candle lantern . Whether or not you decide to carry a candle lantern , you will find a flashlight very handy . First of all , it 's not easy to wake up in the middle of the night and light a candle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or worse ! ) when looking for a spot to relieve yourself . Second , if you intend to hike for any length of time , do n't be surprised if you end up walking at night . Whether this happens intentionally or unintentionally , you 'll need a flashlight . Candle lanterns produce good light but are hard to direct . The flashlight you take backpacking need n't be really powerful . Most hikers use the smaller flashlights equipped with two AA batteries . They are small but adequate . Minimags are popular with hikers because they provide a lot of output for very little weight . Flashlights that require two D cell batteries , or more , are too heavy , and the illumination is overkill for what you 'll need when hiking . Remember though , if you decide to depend solely on a flashlight for your light , you will need a steady supply of batteries . If you choose to use a flashlight rather than a candle lantern for your light , you may want to look into headlamps because they provide a light source that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Backpacking in the ' 90s Headlamps If you 're seriously into night hiking , then you have another good reason to look into purchasing a headlamp . These illuminators are usually on a headband and light the way ahead of you for approximately 250 feet . They are safer than flashlights for night hiking because they leave your hands free . But headlamps are good for more than just night hiking . They also leave your hanrls free for cooking , cleaning and setting up your tent . But they , too , use batteries and have a few other drawbacks , as well . Headlamps are designed two ways ? either with the lamp and batteries attached to the headband or with the lamp attached to the headband and the battery unit ( sometimes including yet another light ) attached to a belt and connected to the headband by wire . The problem with the all-in-one unit is that it tends to be heavy and to induce headaches if you use it for long periods of time . The problem with the latter is that the wires can get caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts you have , the more likely you are to have a short in the wire . A couple of advantages to the two-part system are that it does eliminate headaches and the batteries stay warm when kept on your person . One important factor to keep in mind when purchasing a headlamp is that battery switches tend to come on while sitting in your pack . The Petzl has a screw-type off/on switch that eliminates this problem . Otherwise , you will probably need a piece of duct tape to make sure your headlamp remains in the off position while packed away . Depending on your needs , there are a number of functional headlamps available . For three-season backpacking , the Climb High Headlamp , Hartford Headlite , REI Waterproof , REI Cordless , Panasonic Headlamp and Petzl EO3 Micro are your best bets . Except for the Petzl , which uses only Other Equipment ? 181 two AA batteries and requires more " fill-ups " , the others have decent battery burn times ( approximately eighteen hours at seventy degrees ) . Major manufacturers of headlamps include Hartford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it comes to backpacking , there are only two types of batteries that are worth considering ? alkaline and lithium . Alkaline : These batteries are far more efficient and longerlasting than standard and heavy duty batteries . They offer as much as double the life yet weigh and cost just a bit more . Unlike carbon-zinc cells , the alkaline battery dies suddenly rather than fades out ? a minor disadvantage . Alkaline batteries do recharge themselves a bit and will last for another twenty minutes or so if left to recharge for half-a-day unlike standard batteries that recharge only enough to put out a dim light for another five minutes . Alkalines cost about $2.50 for 182 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s two AA batteries , $3 for two C batteries , and $3 for two D batteries . Lithium : Extremely light and efficient , lithium batteries are also expensive ( though in ratio to their effectiveness and weight not inordinately so ) . Unlike alkaline batteries , lithium will work in cold temperatures . Lithium batteries also have a much longer shelf life than alkaline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely available . Alkaline batteries can be purchased in almost every supermarket , drug store , convenience store and discount store in the United States . Lithiums are much harder to find but are usually stocked by good outdoors stores . They also require special bulbs and there are restrictions about carrying them on aircraft . It is said that under certain conditions ( intense heat or prolonged shorting ) lithium cells may explode , although it is more likely that they will release a small bit of sulfur-dioxide gas than explode . Lithiums range in price from $8 for AA to $15 for a C to $20 for a D cell . Repair Equipment Even if you 're just going out for an overnight hike , it is wise to carry along a few small items to help you out in a pinch . Most problems can be taken care of with these miniature repair kits . Pack Repair Pack pins and rings are the most frequent cause of problems . You 'll be surprised at the number of rings you 'll see littering frequently packed trails . Frank 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , small circles of overlapping wire , are used to keep the pins in place on external frame packs . All those rings on the trail represent pins that are about to work their way loose from hikers ' packs , causing Other Equipment ? 183 #@# #@# Hiking Tip ( ( ( ( Protect your topographic maps from rain . Coat your maps with Stormproof , a solution available from many outdoor retailers . It leaves an invisible water-repellent coating on your maps without making them stiff . A half-pint treats ten to twelve USGS Topo maps and costs about $6. pack bags to sag or hip belts and shoulder straps to spring loose from the frame . Carrying a couple of extra pins and rings could save you much discomfort on a hike . Tent Repair We always carry a tent repair kit , and boy does it come in handy ? and not just for our tent . I 've used it to repair my sleeping bag stuff sack and Frank 's ( and Craig Jolly 's ) rain pants as well as our tent . Tent repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripstop nylon of two types ) , a small amount of duct tape , a needle and thread , a short length of cord , an aluminum splint for tent poles , and no-see-um netting . A good kit , manufactured by Outdoor Research , costs $5 and weighs only 2.5 ounces . If you 're going to be hiking more than two or three months , you 'll want to send ahead some seam sealer . Extensive use is hard on a tent , and you 'll need to reseal the seams every two to three months , depending on how much you use your tent . Stove Repair " Carry a stove repair kit or learn how to build fires , " is long distance hiker Phil Hall 's advice . Stoves will break or have problems when you least expect or desire it . If the manufacturer of your stove offers a kit , it is wise to purchase one . Packing the extra couple of ounces is well worth the peace of 184 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s mind . We use ours , and everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more information . ) Repair kits cost about $5 to $10 and weigh approximately two ounces . Not all stove manufacturers offer repair kits for their stoves ; some stoves are not designed for field repair . Clothing Repair You can purchase a miniature sewing kit , complete with a number of different colored threads , needle , thimble , scissors , needle threader , snaps , and buttons , at almost any drug , discount , grocery or outfitter store . If you 're trying to save room , you can throw an extra needle and applicable thread into your tent-repair kit instead . I carry an entire sewing kit ( approximately two by three inches ) that weighs about an ounce ; and I have used it innumerable times . Dental floss is high strength sewing material if an emergency should strike . For hikes of a week or less , a sewing kit is probably unnecessary . Boot Maintenance Boot leather needs periodic waterproofing ; and hikes of two weeks or more , particularly in wet seasons , will wear the waterproofing off your boots . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will need to either carry along Sno-Seal ( or whatever you use to waterproof your boots ? Silicone Water Guard , Biwell Waterproofing , Aquaseal ) or send it ahead . Waterproofers for boots cost from $3 to $8 . Next I discuss two items ? one I consider necessary and another absolutely unnecessary ? rope and a gun . Other Equipment ? 185 Rope A length of rope , at least ten-feet long and approximately three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter , is absolutely necessary for hiking . As a matter of fact , it would be wise to carry several lengths of rope ranging from a few feet to twenty-feet in length . Rope will definitely prove its usefulness on a hike down any trail . For instance , many trails are in bear country . Whether protected or hunted , bears love human food . Some national parks provide bear-proof shelters or poles on which you can hang your food . In other areas , rope can be used to suspend a bag containing your food and other " smellables " from a tree to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used for hanging your sleeping bags to air and hanging your wet clothes , rigging tents and tarps , lowering or pulling up a pack , hanging a pack from a tree , a belt , replacing frayed straps on gaiters or laces on boots , or for tying to a water bottle when it must be used as a dipper for water . Keep in mind that if you intend to use a tarp on your backpacking trips you will probably need at least fifty-feet of rope because you never know how far apart the trees , rocks or shrubs will be that you will use to set it up . ( Remember , too , that you can tie two lengths of rope together , if necessary . ) Also , the tail of each knot should be at least a couple of inches to insure that the knot wo n't slip . Most outdoors stores offer several types of rope , but the best for general backpacking is heavy-duty twisted or braided nylon rope ranging in width from one-eighth of an inch to onequarter of an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nylon rope , always burn the ends into hard knobs so that the rope does not unravel . 186 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s Knots There are dozens of knots that can be learned , but fortunately only a few you 'll need to know . These will come in handy while backpacking . Double fisherman 's knot : This is the most common backpacking and climbing knot because it can be used to tie two pieces of rope together . It is the safest and easiest to tie : Sheet-bend : This is the simplest way to tie two unequal sizes of rope together and is very strong but the double fisherman is still recommended for climbing ropes . Tautline hitch : This knot can be used for securing lines from a grommet to a stake or tree . Clove hitch : You might use this knot when hanging your food for the night or securing your tarp to a tree . Guns Firearms are a controversial subject among hikers . Most hikers feel that guns are unnecessary , but a few do pack pistols or even rifles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons into a national park is a federal offense , and firearms are outlawed on other sections of trail as well . The real question is , are they necessary ? To find out , we talked to hikers who , collectively , have hiked eighty-thousand miles on the Appalachian Trail as well as thousands of miles on the Pacific Crest , Continental Divide and other 188 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s trails , including some in Europe . We decided that if the hikers we talked to could walk that far without guns , we could prove a point . The bottom line was this : there was neither a single instance where a firearm was brought out of a pack ( if one was carried ) , nor a case of a firearm helping a hiker out of a jam . None of the hikers we talked to , though some had carried guns , thought that firearms were necessary . Guns do have a place , but backpacking is n't one of them ( unless , of course , it is hunting season ; you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot ) . Animals , including humans , do n't present enough danger to hikers to justify carrying firearms . There are a number of additional items that you may choose to carry on your hike , including books , journals , radios , maps , compass . ARISING EARLY ONE SUMMER MORNING , Frank and I and several other backpacker friends hiked to a picnic area before fixing breakfast . The thought of enjoying our repast at a table ( What luxury ! ) was worth breaking camp at dawn and hiking the couple of miles . I so enjoyed my first cup of coffee that I asked Frank if there was enough water left for a second . " Sure , " he said , eyeing the pot still simmering on our Whisperlite . He picked up the pot lifter , but before he could pick up the pot , it tipped over and spilled nearly boiling water right into my lap . Quick-thinking Phil Hall immediately dc.used my lap with cold water from his Nalgene and proceeded to use all the readily available water in the same manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bathhouse and used water-soaked paper towels as compresses until the stinging sensation finally faded . I managed to survive the accident with only one small blister in the groin area . Phil 's lightning fast reaction was the result of experience . He had once been burned by boiling water on a backpacking trip . Whenever you head out into the wilderness , it is essential that you are prepared . We have found that preparation 190 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s means planning . Emergency Medical Procedures for the Outdoors by Patient Medical Associates outlines what to do before you go : If you are hiking with one or more people , it is to your benefit to discuss any existing medical problems and knowledge of first aid . If any of your party suffers from a chronic illness , such as diabetes and epilepsy , or from serious allergies , list names and illnesses . Also note types of medication , dosages , when the medication is given , and where it is kept . If there is no one in your hiking group that knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic first aid , it would be wise to have one of the group take a course that covers these important techniques . If one of your party is trained , he should review the procedures before heading out . If you do n't have a first aid kit , prepare one . A kit containing the basics is described in Chapter 10 . Put the list of names , illnesses , and medications in your kit . If children are hiking with you , explain to them how to get help in an emergency . Before you leave , inform a close friend or relative of your whereabouts and when you intend to arrive and depart . It is likely you 'll have to contend with nothing more serious than a scratch or two . But even the best-prepared person can not account for a seemingly stable rock that tips beneath the foot , twisted roots , or even slippery pine needles . No one intends to hurt themselves while hiking . I still bear the scar on my shin from a bad fall I took after slipping on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day . Why did that one throw me ? Being prepared for backpacking is simply knowing what First Aid ? 191 you 're getting into and what to do when you or someone else is injured . Fortunately , in thousands of miles of backpacking , I have suffered only minor injuries that were easily handled by a basic first-aid kit . Unfortunately , backpackers can not carry everything they might need in case of an accident ? they would n't be able to fit it all in their packs ! In their book , Medicine for the Backcountry ( by ICS Books ) , Frank Hubbell and Buck Tilton claim that the first commandment of first aid kits is " Thou shalt find it impossible to put together the perfect first aid kit . " " Go ahead and try , " they write , " but eventually , if you spend enough time in the backcountry , you will one day wish for something that is not there . " Because it is impossible to carry everything you might need for an outdoors emergency , your next best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in an emergency . You can carry a first aid or instruction manual with you if you are really worried . Taking a first aid course ( wilderness first aid ? course and book offered by Outward Bound ? is best ) is highly recommended to those who spend a lot of time in the outdoors . Taking a course in CPR is recommended for every soul on this planet . Besides a first aid kit and knowledge of backcountry medicine , it is important to know what you 're getting into . Backpacking is more than just a walk in the woods . If you are not prepared to deal with the discomforts that are inherent in carrying a thirty to seventy pound pack on your back as well as the inconveniences involved in a backpacking trip , you need to seriously reconsider getting into the sport . When backpacking , the outdoors is your home . You may have the shelter of a tent over your head at night , but other than that , the sky is your roof and everything beneath it shares its home with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasty 192 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s insects ( bees , mosquitos , ticks ) , and rocks , roots , mud , ... all potential accidents waiting to happen . I 've suffered blisters from new boots , a charlie horse from a slimy puncheon , burns from tipsy pack stoves , mosquito bites and bee stings , scrapes and scratches . Fortunately , all minor injuries that a basic first aid kit easily handled . But , I am not an expert and I am not going to try to be . I think it is important to list the major categories of medical emergencies that occur and give you some idea of how to prevent them . For the most part , I have listed them in alphabetical order because any other order would imply that one medical emergency is more significant than another . While that is generally not true ? one medical problem in the outdoors is just as great as another ? two medical emergencies are so important that they need to be mentioned first . If a person is not breathing they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well die . If a person is breathing and they are not bleeding to death , however , you generally have time to react . So , here 's the list .. . Breathing Problems As I said above , if a person is not breathing they will die . If you do not know how to establish an airway and perform artificial respiration , you should take a CPR course before you head out into the wilderness . Artifical respiration is part of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and will be taught in a CPR course . There are many instances , particularly in drownings and heart attacks , where CPR has saved lives . Watch the television series Emergency 911 sometime ? you 're bound to see CPR used several times in every episode . Bleeding Unless you have a severe aversion to blood ( that is , you get sick or faint at the sight of it ) , you should be able to handle minor injuries while hiking . ( See the section on wounds in this First Aid ? 193 chapter . ) But , what if you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whittling ? Knife wounds often demand an emergency trip to the hospital . I know of many hikers , a brother included , who have watched an emergency room doctor stitch their knife wounds together . How do you stop the bleeding until you or the victim can reach help ? If the usual methods do n't work ? direct pressure and elevation ? you have a problem on your hands . A basic first aid course will teach you what to do should a situation like this arise . If you have n't taken a course in first aid , then what you do to stop the bleeding will have to be a judgement call on your part . But , the bleeding must be stopped . Unfortunately , ignoring the problem wo n't make it go away . People can and do bleed to death . Once again , a first aid course is highly recommended before heading out into the wilderness . Altitude Sickness A friend of ours was attempting an ascent of Mt . McKinley when he began experiencing a headache and nausea , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he retreated ( with much regret ) to their base camp that was at a much lower elevation . A pal descended with him forfeiting his ascent to help out a friend in need . Once back in camp , his symptoms faded , but it was too late to attempt another ascent . Fortunately , he was able to leave Denali on his own two feet . Too many people experiencing altitude sickness require emergency help because they let their symptoms go too far . Although physiological changes ( increased respiration ) occur at 4,000 feet , complications from altitude sickness seldom occur below 10,000 feet . High altitude is usually considered 8,000-12,000 feet ; very high , 12,000-18,000 ; and extremely high , over 18,000 feet . Symptoms of altitude sickness usually begin eight hours or more after a quick ascent . Your first symptom will be a The best way to prevent injuries is too avoid pushing yourself . By avoiding extreme fatigue you will keep your reaction time quick and reduce the chance of accidents . As you begin to feel tired , take breaks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recuperate. headache followed by loss of appetite , nausea , lassitude , and unusual fatigue . You may even vomit and your skin could look bluish or purple . AMS is severe when you no longer can walk a straight line ? heel-to-toe . Edema , or build-up of fluid in the lungs and brain , often kills victims of AMS . Those with edema of the lungs make a crackling noise when breathing that can be heard if you press your ear to their chest . Edema of the brain causes severe headaches , hallucinations , seizures , unconsciousness , coma and then death . The only way to cure AMS is to descend immediately ; the best way to prevent AMS is acclimatize yourself to new altitudes slowly . Never ascend from sea level to 8,000 feet in one day ? always spend at least one night at 5,000-7,000 feet first . Once above 8,000 feet , you should spend each night at only 1,000 feet greater than the previous night , even if you climb higher during the day . And , you 'll acclimatize better if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any higher . Blisters Blisters heal slowly if you continue to hike and keep them aggravated . The best way to avoid this problem is to treat blisters before they occur . When a part of your foot feels hot or tender , stop hiking . Take your shoes and socks off and inspect the tender area . Cut out a piece of moleskin that is larger than the " hot spot " . First Aid ? 195 Apply the moleskin to the hot spot , change your socks , and put your boots back on . Quick action at this stage may prevent blisters altogether . If you do get a blister , try to leave the blister unbroken . If it is still small and relatively flat , cover the blister with moleskin and resume hiking . But if the blister gets worse , wash the area with soap and water and make a small hole in the bottom of the blister with a sterilized needle ( hold it in a flame until the tip turns red ) so that the fluid drains . Once the blister is drained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection . If the blister is already broken , treat it like an open wound ( cleanse and bandage ) and watch for signs of infection . If necessary , quit hiking for a day or two and let your blisters heal . Bruises Bruises occur while backpacking when your pack is improperly fitted or when you fall . It 's easy to prevent bruising from your pack by using the tips in Chapter 9 to fit your pack to your body . Watching your step may keep you from falling . If the bruise is severe and it is not helped by elevation and cold compresses and it increases in both pain and size , it could indicate internal injuries or a fracture . Help should be sought . Burns Burns are easy to prevent because you need only use a modicum of caution . Sitting too close to a campfire , carelessly lighting your backpacking stove or igniting it in a tent , ignoring the sun and refusing to wear sunscreen , and improperly stablizing your cookpot ( on the stove or over a fire ) are all sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caution you should be able to avoid hurting yourself . But , accidents do happen . First-degree burns , including sunburn , appear bright red . 196 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s Treat these minor burns by pouring cold water over the burned area and applying cold compresses for five to ten minutes . The skin should be allowed to air dry if possible . Sunburn can be prevented by the use of a sunscreen with a sun protection factor of fifteen or more . Continued exposure to sun can cause severe burning and , eventually , skin cancer . Antiseptic burn sprays may be used with first-degree burns , but should not be used with second- or third-degree burns . Second-degree burns are characterized by bright red skin , blisters , and swelling . Do not break the blisters . Rather , immerse the burn in cold water or pour cold water over the burned area . Quick action will help reduce the burning effect of heat in the deeper layers of skin . Cover the burn with a sterile bandage . Third-degree burns are highly unlikely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must be treated in a hospital . If third-degree burns occur , do not remove clothing that may adhere to the burns . If you can not get to a hospital within an hour , give the victim a weak solution of salt water to sip on . The solution will help replace essential fluids that have been lost because of the burns . Unlike first- and second-degree burns , do not immerse the burn in cold water . Cover the area with a clean cloth and get the victim to a doctor immediately . Stop , Drop , and Roll A group of backpackers was sitting around a campfire in Michigan when several flaming limbs tumbled over the rocks of the fire ring . Most of the campers were able to jump back in time , but one unlucky hiker , Jack Lean , caught a flaming branch in his lap that quickly ignited his pants . Fortunately , he reacted quickly , dropping immediately to the ground and smothering the flame against the earth . His friends helped by dousing his thighs with cold water from their canteens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 197 clothing to assess the damage , others high-tailed it to the nearest spring for more cold water . Jack 's friends continued to douse his legs with cold water for ten minutes until they were sure that his skin and the tissue beneath it were no longer hot . Due to his quick reaction and the help of his fellow backpackers , Jack suffered only second-degree burns . It is important that you remember ? Stop , Drop , and Roll . The natural tendency is to run , but this will only fuel the flames . By dropping immediately , flames to the ground , you can smother the fire . By rolling back and forth or in complete circles ( depending on the extent of the flames ) , you will completely douse the flames by denying them oxygen . Fortunately , burns from campfires are rare . But keep in mind that many of today 's synthetic fibers are prone to melting rather than igniting . This can make burns more dangerous because the material melts into your skin instead of ashing and flaking away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you face when hiking in cold weather and/or on ice and snow . Humid and windy conditions and wet clothes increase the effects of the cold . If you are fatigued , smoking , drinking alcoholic beverages or under emotional stress , your body is even less resistant . You can prevent injuring yourself when hiking in cold temperatures by keeping these things in mind . If it is really cold , wet and windy , your best bet may be to set up your tent and crawl into your sleeping bag . A little warmth and rest may be all you need to combat the cold . Hypothermia It was a rainy day in Georgia , about forty-five degrees , and Ken could n't wait to get to his planned campsite and make himself some hot tea . A half hour later , soaked to the skin , he 198 ? Backpacking in the ' 90s arrived at the spring that marked the camping area . Rather than pitch his tent , change into some warm clothes , and crawl into his sleeping bag , Ken decided to pull out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been longing for . With numb fingers and a slight case of the shivers , it took Ken several tries to get his stove lit . Cursing , he fumbled open the cap of his nalgene and shakily poured water into his cook pot . Then , apathetically , he sat on the cold , wet ground and waited for his water to boil . By the time little bubbles began to rise from the bottom of the pot , Ken was shivering so badly that he could n't control his hand movements . Missing his cup entirely , he poured the hot water all over the soggy ground . Cursing and weeping , Ken stumbled over to the spring for more water . With much difficulty , he was able to get some water in his nalgene ; but when he returned to his stove , he was unable to light it , and frankly , no longer cared to . His shivering was stopping , he was feeling kind of sleepy , and he was enjoying the trees . They were dancing for him . The next morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first signs of hypothermia ? shivering , numbness , drowsiness , and marked muscular weakness ? are followed by mental confusion and impairment of judgment , slurred speech , failing eyesight , and eventually , unconsciousness . Death , if it occurs , is usually due to heart failure . Be aware that the most serious warning sign that a hypothermia victim is going down fast is when the shivering stops . It means the victim is close to death . You are most likely to become hypothermic after you have stopped hiking , especially if you are tired . Movement keeps you warm . Your body 's core temperature can drop once you stop . Fortunately , hypothermia is easy to combat if caught First Aid ? 199 early . If you arrive at your campsite on a cold , wet day and are experiencing any of the symptoms mentioned above , drop everything and make yourself warm . Strip yourself of your wet clothes and put on dry clothes if possible . Crawl into your sleeping bag and if you 're able , heat up something hot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot will help raise your internal temperature . Drinks with a high sugar content are best . You may want to carry along a pack of fruit gelatin . It tastes great when heated and contains a lot of sugar . But get your body warm first ! Do n't take the time to heat yourself something to drink until you 've rid yourself of the wet clothes . If you 're with someone else or happen on someone showing signs of hypothermia , try sharing body heat . If you 're not too shy , strip down to your underwear or to nothing at all and crawl into a sleeping bag with the victim . Direct skirt contact does wonders for transferring heat . Once the victim is in dry clothes , wrapped in a warm sleeping bag , and sipping on something warm to drink , you can try building a fire for added warmth . Remember to take hypothermia seriously . Most hypothermia victims die in forty- to fifty-degree weather . Frostbite Frostbite occurs when crystals begin to form either superficially or in the fluids and soft tissues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of frostbite will be more severe if the affected area is thawed and then refrozen . Fortunately , the areas affected by frostbite are usually small . The nose , cheeks , ears , fingers , and toes are the most common areas . Before frostbite occurs , the area will look flushed and then become white or grayish yellow . Pain is often felt early but usually subsides ? if you feel any pain at all .
